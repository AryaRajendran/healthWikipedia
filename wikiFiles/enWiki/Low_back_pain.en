'''Low back pain''' or '''lumbago''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|l|ʌ|m|ˈ|b|eɪ|ɡ|oʊ}}) is a common [[musculoskeletal disorders|musculoskeletal disorder]] affecting 80% of people at some point in their lives. In the United States it is the most common cause of job-related disability, a leading contributor to missed work, and the second most common neurological ailment — only [[headache]] is more common.<ref name=NIH_2008/>  It can be either [[Pain#Duration|acute, subacute or chronic]] in duration.   With conservative measures, the symptoms of low back [[pain]] typically show significant improvement within a few weeks from onset.

==Classification==
Lower back pain may be classified by the duration of symptoms as acute, subacute and chronic.  Within these classifications, there is no agreement across medical organizations for the specific duration of symptoms, but generally pain lasting less than six weeks is classified as ''acute'', pain lasting six to 12 weeks is ''subacute'', and more than 12 weeks is ''chronic''.<ref name=koes_2010/>

==Cause==
The majority of lower back pain is referred to as ''non specific low back pain'' and does not have a definitive cause.<ref name=casazza_2012/> It is believed to stem from benign musculoskeletal problems such as [[Human_back#Muscles_of_the_back|muscle]] or soft tissues [[sprain]] or [[Strain (injury)|strain]]s.<ref name=NIH_2008/> This is particularly true when the pain arose suddenly during physical loading of the back, with the pain lateral to the spine. Over 99% of back pain instances fall within this category.<ref name=henschke_2009/> The full differential diagnosis includes many other less common conditions.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Illu vertebral column.jpg|thumb|The lumbar region in regards to the rest of the spine.]]
[[File:ACDF oblique annotated english.svg|thumb|The nerve and bone components of the vertebrae.]]

=== Pain sensation and perception ===
In general, pain is an unpleasant feeling in response to stimuli that have the potential to damage or do damage the body's tissues ([[noxious stimulus|noxious stimuli]]).  There are four fundamental steps in the process of pain perception:  transduction, transmission, perception and modulation.  The process starts when the painful event stimulates the endings of the pain-sensing nerve cells ([[nociceptor|nociceptors]]).  A nociceptor converts the stimulus into an electrical signal by [[transduction (physiology)|transduction]].  Several different types of nerve fibers carry out the transmission of the electrical signal from the transducing nociceptor to the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn of the spinal cord]], from there to the [[brainstem|brain stem]], and then from the brain stem to the various parts of the brain such as the [[thalamus]] and the [[limbic system]], where pain signals are processed and given context in the process of pain [[perception]].  Through modulation, the brain can then modify the sending of further pain impulses by signaling the release of neurotransmitters that either inhibit them (for example, [[serotonin]] and [[endorphins]]) or excite them.<ref name=salzberg_2012/>

=== Back structures ===
The lumbar region (or lower back region) is made up of five [[vertebrae]] (L1-L5). In between these vertebrae lie fibrocartilage discs ([[intervertebral discs]]), which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together while at the same time protecting the [[spinal cord]]. Nerves stem from the [[spinal cord]] through [[Foramen|foramina]] within the vertebrae, providing muscles with sensations and motor associated messages. Stability of the spine is provided through ligaments and muscles of the back, lower back and abdomen.  Small joints which prevent, as well as direct, motion of the spine are called facet joints ([[zygapophysial joints]]).<ref name=floyd_2008/>

Causes of lower back pain are varied.  Most cases are believed to be due to a [[sprain]] or [[Strain (injury)|strain]] in the [[Human_back#Muscles_of_the_back|muscles and soft tissues of the back]].<ref name=NIH_2008/> Overactivity of the muscles of the back can lead to an injured or torn ligament in the back which in turn leads to pain. An injury can also occur to one of the intervertebral discs (disc tear, disc herniation). Due to aging, discs begin to diminish and shrink in size, resulting in vertebrae and facet joints rubbing against one another. Ligament and joint functionality also diminishes as one ages, leading to [[spondylolisthesis]], which causes the vertebrae to move much more than they should. Pain is also generated through [[lumbar spinal stenosis]], [[sciatica]] and [[scoliosis]]. At the lowest end of the spine, some patients may have tailbone pain (also called [[coccyx]] pain or [[coccydynia]]). Others may have pain from their [[sacroiliac joint]], where the spinal column attaches to the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], called [[sacroiliac joint dysfunction]] which may be responsible for 22.6% of low back pain.<ref name=bernard_1987/> Physical causes may include [[osteoarthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[degenerative disc disease|degeneration of the discs]] between the [[vertebrae]] or a [[spinal disc herniation]], a vertebral fracture (such as from [[osteoporosis]]), or rarely, an infection or tumor.<ref name=burke_1964/>

In the vast majority of cases, no noteworthy or serious cause is ever identified. If the pain resolves after a few weeks, intensive testing is not indicated.<ref name=atlas_2010/>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=April 2013}}

===Differential diagnosis===
For correct diagnosis, non-specific low back pain must be differentiated from [[radiculopathy]] and serious spinal problems such as a tumor, infection or spinal fracture.  Certain signs, termed "red flags," may indicate a more serious condition, and prompt a more extensive investigation using  [[diagnostic imaging]] or laboratory testing; even so, most individuals seeking treatment for acute low back pain have one or more red flags but no serious underlying problem.  With other causes ruled out, people with non-specific low back pain typically are treated symptomatically, without exact determination of the underlying cause.<ref name=koes_2010/><ref name=casazza_2012/>

===Imaging===
Complaints of lower back pain are one of the most common reasons why people visit doctors.<ref name=AHRQ_2012/>  Although medical societies do not recommend imaging tests such as an [[X-ray]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]], or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] within a few weeks of the onset of pain as the pain is likely to subside,<ref name=AHRQ_2012/> many patients and doctors use them to try to find the cause of the pain.<ref name=AHRQ_2012/>  Such tests are not required in lower back pain except in the cases where "red flags" are present,<ref name=chou_2009_imaging/> and fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of a problem.<ref name=AHRQ_2012/>  In most cases, the tests are not necessary, and most people with feel better after a month regardless of whether they undergo imaging.<ref name=AHRQ_2012/>  Routine imaging may be harmful to a person's health from the radiation used, and more imaging is associated with higher expense and higher rates of surgery but no resultant benefit.<ref name=chou_2011/>  Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities which encourage the patient to request further unnecessary testing or to worry.<ref name=AHRQ_2012/>  Even so, from 1994 to 2006, in the United States, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among Medicare beneficiaries.<ref name=deyo_2009/>

==Prevention==
[[Physical exercise|Exercise]] is effective in preventing recurrence of non-acute pain, however in the treatment of acute episodes results are mixed.<ref name=choi_2010/> Proper lifting techniques may be useful.<ref name=delavier_2006/> [[Lumbar support]] does not appear effective.<ref name=van_duijvenbode_2008/>  Firm mattresses have demonstrated less effectiveness in preventing back pain than medium-firm mattresses.<ref name=kovacs_2003/>

Cigarette smoking impacts the success and proper healing of spinal fusion surgery in patients who undergo cervical fusion; rates of nonunion are significantly greater for smokers than for nonsmokers.<ref name=spineuniverse/>  Smoke and nicotine accelerate spine deterioration, reduce blood flow to the lower spine, and cause discs to degenerate.<ref name=mayo/>

==Management==

===Acute pain===

For acute cases that are not debilitating, the treatment goal is to restore normal function and return the individual to work while minimizing pain.  The condition is normally not serious, most often resolves without significant intervention, and recovery is aided by attempting to resume normal activity as soon as possible within the limits of pain; providing afflicted individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is effective in hastening recovery.<ref name=casazza_2012/>  Low back pain may be best treated with conservative self-care,<ref name=chou_2007/> including: application of heat or cold,<ref name=french_2006/><ref name=garra_2010/> and continued activity within the limits of the pain.<ref name=koes_2010/>

Engaging in physical activity within the limits of pain aids recovery. Prolonged bed rest (more than 2 days) is considered counterproductive.<ref name=koes_2006/> Even with cases of severe pain, some activity is preferred to prolonged sitting or lying down - excluding movements that would further strain the back.<ref name=atlas_2010/>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=April 2013}} Structured [[exercise]] in acute low back pain has demonstrated neither improvement nor harm.<ref name=choi_2010/> Heat application may have a modest benefit. The evidence for cold therapy however is limited.<ref name=french_2006/>

====Physical therapy====
Physical therapy can include heat, ice, massage, [[ultrasound]], and electrical stimulation. Active therapies can consist of stretching, strengthening and aerobic exercises. Exercising to restore motion and strength to your lower back can be very helpful in relieving pain and preventing future episodes of low back pain.<ref name=AAOS_2009/> Treatment according to [[McKenzie method]] is somewhat effective for acute low back pain, but not for chronic low-back pain.<ref name=machado_2006/> The benefit in the short term does not appear clinically significant.<ref name=casazza_2012/>

====Medications====
Short term use of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, such as [[NSAIDs]] or [[acetaminophen]] may help relieve the symptoms of lower back pain.<ref name=koes_2006/><ref name=vantulder_2006/> [[NSAIDs]] are slightly effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica.<ref name=roelofs_2008/> [[Muscle relaxant]]s for acute and chronic pain have some benefit,<ref name=koes_2006/><ref name=vantulder_2006/> and are more effective in relieving pain and spasms when used in combination with NSAIDs.<ref name=malanga_2010/> Oral [[steroids]] have not been shown to be useful.<ref name=casazza_2012/>

====Manual therapies====
It is not known if [[chiropractic]] care improves clinical outcomes in those with lower back pain more or less than other treatments.<ref name=walker_2011/> A 2012 [[Cochrane review]] found that [[spinal manipulation]] was no more effective than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments and adding it to other treatment does not appear to increase the benefit.<ref name=rubinstein_2012/> A 2010 systematic review found that most studies suggest SM achieves equal or superior improvement in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up.<ref name=dagenais_2010/> National guidelines come to different conclusions with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course in those who do not improve with other treatments.<ref name=koes_2010/>

In 2007 the American College of Physicians and the [[American Pain Society]] jointly recommended that it be considered for people who do not improve with self care options.<ref name=chou_2007/> [[Acupuncture]] and [[massage]] is without substantial benefit.<ref name=casazza_2012/>

===Chronic pain===
Low back pain is more likely to be persistent among people who previously required time off from work because of low back pain, those who expect passive treatments to help, those who believe that back pain is harmful or disabling or fear that any movement whatever will increase their pain, and people who have depression or anxiety.<ref name=atlas_2010/>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=April 2013}} A number of factors predict disability from back pain and include those who have poor coping behaviors or who fear activity are about 2.5 times as likely to have poor outcomes at a year.<ref name=chou_2010/> Intensive multidisciplinary treatment programs may help subacute<ref name=koes_2006/> or chronic<ref name=vantulder_2006/> low back pain.<ref name=atlas_2010/>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=April 2013}} [[Behavioral therapy]] may be useful.<ref name=vantulder_2006/>

====Exercise====
Exercise therapy appears to be slightly effective at reducing pain and improving function in the treatment of chronic low back pain.<ref name=hayden_2005/> Compared to usual care, exercise therapy improved post-treatment pain intensity and disability, and long-term function.<ref name=middelkoop_2011/> Exercise programmes are effective for chronic LBP up to 6 months after treatment cessation, evidenced by pain score reduction and reoccurrence rates.<ref name=smith_2010/> There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is clearly more effective than others.<ref name=middelkoop_2010/> The [[Alexander technique]] appears useful for chronic back pain.<ref name=woodman_2012/> There is tentative evidence to support the use of [[yoga]].<ref name=ernst_2011/>

====Medications====
[[Antidepressant]]s appear ineffective in the treatment of chronic back pain<ref name=urquhart_2008/> even though some previous studies found them helpful.<ref name=vantulder_2006/> [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s are recommended in a 2007 guideline by the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society.<ref name=king_2008/> [[Prolotherapy]], facet joint injections, and intradiscal steroid injections have not been found to be effective.<ref name=chou_2009_rehab/> Epidural corticosteroid injections provide only slight temporary relief of [[sciatica]] with no long term benefit.<ref name=pinto_2012/> The role of [[narcotic]]s for ''chronic'' low back pain is uncertain.<ref name=deshpande_2007/>

====Manual therapies====
The effectiveness of  [[spinal manipulation]] is more or less equal to other commonly prescribed treatment for chronic low-back pain, such as, exercise therapy, standard medical care or physiotherapy.<ref name=rubinstein_2011/> Some national guidelines consider its use optional, some do not recommend and others suggest a short course in those who do not improve with other measures.<ref name=koes_2010/> [[Manipulation under anaesthesia]], or medically assisted manipulation, currently has insufficient evidence to make any strong recommendations.<ref name=dagenais_2008/> [[Acupuncture]] may help chronic pain;<ref name=vantulder_2006/> however, a more recent [[randomized controlled trial]]suggested insignificant difference between real and sham acupuncture.<ref name=haake_2007/> [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic lower back pain.<ref name=dubinsky_2009/> [[Massage]] therapy may benefit some to those with prolonged pain.<ref name=furlan_2008/>

====Surgery====
Surgery may be indicated when conservative treatment is not effective or when a person develops progressive and functionally limiting neurological symptoms such as leg weakness, bladder or bowel incontinence.<ref name=manusov_2012/> [[Spinal fusion]] has been shown not to improve outcomes in those with simple chronic low back pain.<ref name=bestbets_3/> [[Discectomy]], in those with a herniated disc causing nerve root compression, resulted in better outcomes at one year but not in four to ten years.<ref name=manusov_2012/> Benefits of spinal surgery are limited when dealing with degenerative discs.<ref name=mirza_2007/> Surgical implants increased the risk with no added improvement in pain or function.<ref name=deyo_2009/>

==Prognosis==
Determining a general prognosis from the available evidence for low back pain is difficult.  Inconsistencies in the data are probably due to variations across the sources in the definitions used for the characteristics of the condition.  As well, the studies lack of the ideal kinds of evidence about the condition.<ref name=menezes_2012/>

===Acute===
In general, the short term prognosis for acute low back pain is positive.  Pain and disability usually improve significantly in the first six weeks after onset of symptoms.  After six weeks, improvement slows with only small gains up to one year.  At one year after onset, pain and disability levels are low to minimal, on average.  One review found distress, previous low back pain incidents, and job satisfaction to be probable prognostic factors.<ref name=menezes_2012/>

===Chronic===
For persistent low back pain, the short term prognosis is also positive, with significant improvement in the first six weeks, but very little improvement after that.  At one year, those with chronic low back pain can anticipate still having moderate pain and disability.<ref name=menezes_2012/>  Poor pain coping skills, functional impairment, poor general health, and a significant psychological ([[Waddell's signs]]) or psychiatric component to the pain are probable prognostic factors for chronic pain.<ref name=chou_2010/>

==Epidemiology==
Low back pain that lasts at least one day and limits activity is a very common and widespread complaint.<ref name=hoy_2012/> Over a lifetime, 80% of people have lower back pain,<ref name=urquhart_2008/> with the difficulty most often beginning between 20 and 40&nbsp;years old.<ref name=casazza_2012/> Globally, approximately 9 to 12% of people have lower back pain at any given point in time, and nearly one quarter (23.2%) report having it at some point over any given one-month period.<ref name=hoy_2012/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163-96|pmid=23245607}}</ref>

It is most common among women, and among people aged 40{{endash}}80{{nbsp}}years, with the overall number of individuals affected expected to increase as the population ages.<!-- ref name=hoy_2012/-->  Women may be more prone to raise the complaint due to pain related to osteoporosis, menstruation or pregnancy, or it may be that women are more willing than men to report pain due to differences in social expectations between the two groups.<!-- ref name=hoy_2012/--> Prevalence is elevated among adolescents, with females reporting it earlier than males, possibly showing a correlation between low back pain and the onset of puberty, as females enter puberty earlier than males.<ref name=hoy_2012/> Of American adults, 26% report pain of at least one day in duration every three months.<ref name=deyo_2006/>

==History==
[[File:L4-l5-disc-herniation.png|thumb|Historically, the introduction of a new imaging technology like MRI has refocused attention on discogenic causes (L4-L5 herniation shown), even though disk problems have been found to be the cause of low back pain only infrequently.]]
Low back pain has been with humans since at least the [[Bronze Age]].  The oldest known surgical treatise - the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], dating to about 1500 BCE - describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a physician to use on encountering a vertebral sprain.  [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to make use of terms for sciatic pain and low back pain; [[Galen]] (active mid to late second century CE) detailed the concepts.  Physicians through the end of the first millennium did not attempt back surgery of any kind, and recommended only [[watchful waiting]].  Through the [[Medieval period]], folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.<ref name=maharty_2012/>

By the start of the 20th century, physicians thought low back pain was simply caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves,<ref name=maharty_2012/> with neuralgia and neuritis frequently cited;<ref name=lutz_2003/> the popularity of such proposed neural main etiologies declined steadily throughout the century.<ref name=lutz_2003/>  In the 1920s and 30s, new theories for the cause of low pack pain arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as neurasthenia, hysteria, or psychogenesis.<ref name=maharty_2012/>  Muscular causes such as "muscular rheumatism" (now called [[fibromyalgia]]) were cited with increasing frequency as well.<ref name=lutz_2003/>

Emerging technologies such as radiography gave physicians new diagnostic tools, which revealed the intervertebral disk as a source for back pain.  In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disk-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery;<ref name=lutz_2003/> consequently, in the 1940s, the vertebral disk model of low back pain took over,<ref name=maharty_2012/> dominating the literature through the 1980s, especially after the rise of new imaging technologies such as CT and MRI.<ref name=lutz_2003/>  Such discussion later subsided as further research showed that it was actually relatively uncommon for disk problems to be the source of the pain, but even with the knowledge that diagnostic tools could show abnormalities probably unrelated to the patient's pain, physicians would still look to the tools' results instead of physical examinations for diagnosis and treatment plans.  Since then, physicians have come to question whether it is likely that they will be able to identify a specific cause for a complaint of low back pain, or whether finding one is even necessary, as most complaints resolve themselves within six to 12 week regardless of treatment.<ref name=maharty_2012/>
<!--
In 1987, the Quebec Task Force was the first to publish a clinical guideline regarding low back pain, describing the lack of strong evidence required to make confident diagnostic and treatment decisions.  Since that time, both the quantity and quality of research into the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy for low back pain has increased significantly.<ref name=koes_2010/>
-->

==Economics==
In the United States, estimates of the costs of low back pain range between $38 and $50 billion a year and there are 300,000 operations annually.  Back and neck operations are the third most common form of surgery in the United States.<ref name=ACSM_2009/>  Between 1990 and 2001 there was a 220% increase in spinal fussions in the United States, despite the fact that during that period there were no changes, clarifications, or improvements in the indications for surgery or new evidence of improved effectiveness.<ref name=deyo_2009/>

==Women==
Women may experience acute low back pain due to certain medical conditions of the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids.<ref name=medline_lbp_acute_2012/>

An estimated 50-70% of [[pregnant]] women experience back pain.<ref name=danforth_2003/> As one gets farther along in the pregnancy, due to the additional weight of the fetus, one’s center of gravity will shift forward causing one’s [[posture]] to change. This change in posture leads to increasing lower back pain.<ref name=danforth_2003/><ref name=williams_2005/>
