In [[tetrapod]] [[anatomy]] the '''trachea''', or '''windpipe''', is a tube that connects the [[pharynx]] and [[larynx]] to the [[lung]]s, allowing the passage of [[air]]. It is lined with [[pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s with [[goblet cell]]s that produce [[mucus]]. This mucus lines the cells of the trachea to trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then [[waft]] upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the [[stomach]] or expelled as [[phlegm]].

Despite the name, not all vertebrates have a trachea; only non-[[fish]] ones. The name is used in contrast with [[invertebrate trachea]], a structure in [[arthropod]] anatomy.

==In non-humans==

Allowing for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other [[mammal]]s is, in general, similar to that in humans. In general, the [[reptile|reptilian]] trachea is also similar.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 336–337|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

In [[bird]]s, the trachea runs from the [[pharynx]] to the [[syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], from which the [[Main bronchus|primary bronchi]] diverge. [[Swan]]s have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the [[sternum]]; this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. In some birds, the cartilagenous rings are complete, and may even be [[ossification|ossified]].<ref name=VB/>

In [[amphibian]]s, the trachea is normally extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi. A longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked [[salamander]]s, and in [[caecilian]]s. While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found in [[amniote]]s.<ref name=VB/>

The only vertebrate to have lungs, but no trachea, is ''[[Polypterus]]'', in which the lungs arise directly from the pharynx.<ref name=VB/>

==In humans==
[[File:Trachea.jpg|thumb|right|370px|Trachea]]
[[File:Relations of the aorta, trachea, esophagus and other heart structures.png|thumb|320px|In humans, the trachea passes ventrally to the [[esophagus]], dorsally to the ascending [[aortic arch]], but the [[left main bronchus]] that the trachea gives off passes ventrally to the descending [[aortic arch]].]]
The trachea has an inner diameter of about {{convert|25|mm|in|sigfig=1}} and a length of about {{convert|10|to|16|cm|in|sigfig=1}}. It commences at the lower border of the [[larynx]], level with the [[cervical vertebra 6|sixth cervical vertebra]], and bifurcates into the primary [[bronchus|bronchi]] at the vertebral level of [[thoracic vertebra]] T5, or up to two vertebrae lower or higher, depending on breathing.

There are about fifteen to twenty incomplete C-shaped [[Tracheal rings|cartilaginous rings]] that reinforce the anterior and lateral sides of the trachea to protect and maintain the airway, leaving a membranous wall (''pars membranacea'') dorsally without cartilage. The [[trachealis muscle]] connects the ends of the incomplete rings and contracts during [[coughing]], reducing the size of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the trachea to increase the air flow rate. The [[esophagus]] lies posteriorly to the trachea. The cartilaginous rings are incomplete to allow the trachea to collapse slightly so that food can pass down the [[esophagus]]. A flap-like [[epiglottis]] closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing to prevent swallowed matter from entering the trachea. 
Lined with [[respiratory epithelium]].

==Tracheal diseases and conditions==

The following are diseases and conditions that affect the trachea:

* [[Choking]]
* [[Tracheotomy]], a surgical procedure on the neck to open a direct airway through an incision in the trachea
* [[Tracheomalacia]] (weakening of the tracheal cartilage)
** [[Tracheal collapse]] (in dogs)
*[[Tracheobronchial injury]] (perforation of the trachea or [[bronchi]])
*[[Mounier-Kuhn syndrome]] (causes abnormal enlargement of the trachea)

===Transplantation===

In 2008, a Colombian woman received a trachea [[organ transplant|transplant]] using her own stem cells so her body would not reject the transplant.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/12/26/year.review.health/index.html | work=CNN | title=The top health stories of 2008 - CNN.com | date=2008-12-26 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref>  In June 2011, a team of surgeons led by Professor [[Paolo Macchiarini]] at the [[Karolinska University Hospital]]  performed the first synthetic windpipe transplant on a 36-year-old [[Eritrea]]n man, Andemariam Teklesenbet Beyene.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14047670 | date=2011-07-07 | accessdate=2011-07-07 | work=BBC News | title=Surgeons carry out first synthetic windpipe transplant}}</ref><ref>[http://www.karolinska.se/en/OM/press-nyheter/nyhetslista/First-Successful-Transplantation-of-a-Synthetic-Tissue-Engineered-Windpipe-/ First Successful Transplantation of a Synthetic Tissue Engineered Windpipe].
