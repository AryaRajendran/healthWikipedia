A '''microorganism''' (from the {{lang-el|μικρός}}, ''mikrós'', "small" and {{lang|grc|ὀργανισμός}}, ''organismós'', "organism") or '''microbe''' is a [[Microscope|microscopic]] [[organism]], which may be a [[unicellular organism|single cell]]<ref name=Brock>{{cite book | author = Madigan M, Martinko J (editors) | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 13th | publisher = Pearson Education | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-321-73551-X |page = 1096}}</ref> or [[multicellular organism]]. The study of microorganisms is called [[microbiology]], a subject that began with [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s discovery of microorganisms in 1675, using a [[microscope]] of his own design.

Microorganisms are very diverse; they include all of the [[prokaryotes]], namely the [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]; and various forms of [[eukaryote]], comprising the [[protozoa]], [[fungi]], [[algae]], microscopic [[plants]] ([[green algae]]), and [[Micro-animals|animals]] such as [[rotifer]]s and [[planarian]]s.

Microorganisms live in all parts of the [[biosphere]] including [[soil]], [[hot spring]]s, on the [[ocean]] floor, high in the [[atmosphere]] and deep inside rocks within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] (see also [[endolith]]). Microorganisms are critical to nutrient recycling in [[ecosystems]] as they act as [[decomposer]]s.

===Pre-microbiology===
The possibility that microorganisms  exist was discussed for many centuries before their actual discovery in the 17th century. The existence of unseen microbiological life was postulated by [[Jainism]], which is based on [[Mahavira]]'s teachings as early as 6th century BCE.<ref>Mahavira is dated 599 BCE - 527 BCE. See. {{Cite book| last =Dundas | first =Paul | coauthors =John Hinnels ed. | title =The Jains | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =0-415-26606-8 }} p. 24</ref> Paul Dundas notes that Mahavira asserted existence of unseen microbiological creatures living in earth, water, air and fire.<ref>Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 88</ref> [[Jain scriptures]] also describe [[nigoda]]s, which are sub-microscopic creatures living in large clusters and having a very short life and are said to pervade each and every part of universe, even in tissues of plants and flesh of animals.<ref>*{{Cite book| last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }}  p. 109</ref> However, the earliest known idea to indicate the possibility of diseases spreading by yet unseen organisms was that of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in a 1st century BC book titled ''On Agriculture'' in which he warns against locating a homestead near swamps:
{{quote|… and because there are bred certain minute creatures that cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and they cause serious diseases.<ref>''Varro On Agriculture'' 1,xii Loeb</ref>}}

In ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1020), [[Abū Alī ibn Sīnā]] (Avicenna) hypothesized that [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases might be contagious<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tschanz |first=David W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Arab Roots of European Medicine |journal=Heart Views |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages= |id= |url=http://www.hmc.org.qa/hmc/heartviews/h-v-v4%20n2/9.htm |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Advice to the Young Physician: On the Art of Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DoMVs4HuDAoC&pg=PA33&dq=avicenna+infectious+diseases+quarantine&q=avicenna%20infectious|last=Colgan|first=Richard|page=33|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4419-1033-2}}</ref>

In 1546, [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] proposed that [[epidemic]] [[diseases]] were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances.

All these early claims about the existence of microorganisms were speculative and were not based on any data or science. Microorganisms were neither proven, observed, nor correctly and accurately described until the 17th century. The reason for this was that all these early studies lacked the [[microscope]].

[[File:Robert Koch.jpg|thumb|epicupright|[[Robert Koch]] showed that microorganisms caused [[disease]]]]

[[Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723) was one of the first people to observe microorganisms, using a microscope of his own design, thereby making one of the most important contributions to [[biology]].<ref>Payne, A.S. ''The Cleere Observer: A Biography of Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek'', p. 13, Macmillan, 1970</ref>  [[Robert Hooke]] was the first to use a microscope to observe living things; his 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'' contained descriptions of plant cells.

Before Leeuwenhoek's discovery of microorganisms in 1675, it had been a mystery  why [[grapes]] could be turned into [[wine]], [[milk]] into [[cheese]], or why food would spoil. Leeuwenhoek did not make the connection between these processes and microorganisms, but using a microscope, he did establish that there were forms of life that were not visible to the naked eye.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Leeuwenhoek A | title = Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, concerning the Worms in Sheeps Livers, Gnats, and Animalcula in the Excrements of Frogs | url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=4j53731651310230 | journal = Philosophical Transactions (1683–1775) | volume = 22 | pages = 509–18 | year = 1753 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1700.0013 |accessdate=30 November 2006| issue = 260–276 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| author = Leeuwenhoek A | title = Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, F.

[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] (1729–1799) found that boiling broth would [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilise]] it, killing any microorganisms in it. He also found that new microorganisms could only settle in a broth if the broth was exposed to air. 

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) expanded upon Spallanzani's findings by exposing boiled broths to the air, in vessels that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium, and also in vessels with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a curved tube that would not allow dust particles to come in contact with the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths at the beginning of his experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as [[spore]]s on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported [[germ theory of disease|germ theory]].

In 1876, [[Robert Koch]] (1843–1910) established that microbes can cause disease. He found that the blood of cattle who were infected with [[anthrax]] always had large numbers of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking a small sample of blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microbe and a disease and these are now known as [[Koch's postulates]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905] Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 November 2006.</ref> Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = O'Brien S, Goedert J | title = HIV causes AIDS: Koch's postulates fulfilled | journal = Curr Opin Immunol | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 613–18 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8902385 | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(96)80075-6}}</ref>

Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere in the [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] organization of life on the planet. [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] are almost always microscopic, while a number of [[eukaryote]]s are also microscopic, including most [[Protista|protists]], some [[fungus|fungi]], as well as some [[Micro-animals|animals]] and plants. [[Viruses]] are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microbes, although the field of [[microbiology]] also encompasses the study of viruses.

===Prokaryotes===
{{Main|Prokaryote}}

Prokaryotes are organisms that lack a [[cell nucleus]] and the other membrane bound organelles. They are almost always unicellular, although some species such as [[myxobacteria]] can aggregate into complex structures as part of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].

Consisting of two [[Domain (biology)|domains]], [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], the prokaryotes are the most diverse and abundant group of [[organism]]s on [[Earth]] and inhabit practically all environments where the temperature is below +140 °C.

====Archaea====
{{Main|Archaea}}
Archaea are also single-celled organisms that lack [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]]. In the past, the differences between bacteria and archaea were not recognised and archaea were classified with bacteria as part of the kingdom [[Monera]]. However, in 1990 the microbiologist [[Carl Woese]] proposed the [[three-domain system]] that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | doi= 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc = 54159 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}</ref> Archaea differ from bacteria in both their genetics and biochemistry.

===Eukaryotes===

{{Main|Eukaryote}}

Most living things that are visible to the naked eye in their adult form are [[eukaryote]]s, including [[human]]s. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], eukaryotes contain [[organelle]]s such as the [[cell nucleus]], the [[Golgi apparatus]] and [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in their [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the [[DNA]] that makes up a cell's [[genome]].

Unicellular eukaryotes consist of a single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] throughout their life cycle.  This qualification is significant since most [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] eukaryotes consist of a single cell called a [[zygote]] only at the beginning of their life cycles. Microbial eukaryotes can be either [[haploid]] or [[diploid]], and some organisms have multiple [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] (see [[coenocyte]]). 

====Protists====
{{Main|Protista}}

Of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups, the [[protists]] are most commonly [[unicellular]] and microscopic. This is a highly diverse group of organisms that are not easy to classify.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cavalier-Smith T |title=Kingdom protozoa and its 18 phyla |journal=Microbiol.

====Animals====
{{Main|Micro-animals}}
Most animals are multicellular,<ref>At least one animal group is unicellular in its adult form: see [[Myxozoa]].</ref> but some are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Microscopic [[arthropod]]s include [[dust mite]]s and [[spider mite]]s. Microscopic [[crustacean]]s include [[copepod]]s and the [[cladocera]], while many [[nematode]]s are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Another particularly common group of microscopic animals are the [[rotifer]]s, which are filter feeders that are usually found in fresh water. Micro-animals reproduce both sexually and asexually and may reach new habitats as some eggs can survive harsh environments that would kill the adult animal. However, some simple animals, such as rotifers and nematodes, can dry out completely and remain dormant for long periods of time.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lapinski J, Tunnacliffe A |title=Anhydrobiosis without trehalose in bdelloid rotifers |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=553 |issue=3 |pages=387–90 |year=2003 |pmid=14572656 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01062-7}}</ref>

====Fungi====
{{Main|Fungus}}
The fungi have several unicellular species, such as baker's yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''). Some fungi, such as the pathogenic yeast ''[[Candida albicans]]'', can undergo [[phenotypic switching]] and grow as single cells in some environments, and [[Hypha|filamentous hyphae]] in others.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kumamoto CA, Vinces MD |title=Contributions of hyphae and hypha-co-regulated genes to Candida albicans virulence |journal=Cell.

====Plants====
{{Main|Plant}}
The [[green algae]] are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as [[protist]]s, others such as [[charophyta]] are classified with [[embryophyte]] plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial [[flagellate]]s, usually but not always with two [[flagellum|flagella]] per cell, as well as various colonial, [[coccoid]], and filamentous forms. In the [[Charales]], which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Thomas, David C. |title=Seaweeds |publisher=Natural History Museum |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-565-09175-1 }}</ref>

==Habitats and ecology==
Microorganisms are found in almost every [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] present in nature. Even in hostile environments such as the [[geographical pole|poles]], [[desert]]s, [[geyser]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, and the [[deep sea]]. Some types of microorganisms have adapted to the extreme conditions and sustained colonies; these organisms are known as [[extremophiles]]. Extremophiles have been isolated from rocks as much as 7 kilometres below the Earth's surface,<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Szewzyk U, Szewzyk R, Stenström T | title = Thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria isolated from a deep borehole in granite in Sweden | doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1810 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1810–3 | year = 1994 | pmid = 11607462 | pmc = 43253 | bibcode=1994PNAS...91.1810S}}</ref> and it has been suggested that the amount of living organisms below the Earth's surface may be comparable with the amount of life on or above the surface.<ref name=Gold/> Extremophiles have been known to survive for a prolonged time in a [[vacuum]], and can be highly resistant to [[ultraviolet radiation|radiation]], which may even allow them to survive in space.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Horneck G | title = Survival of microorganisms in space: a review | journal = Adv Space Res | volume = 1 | issue = 14 | pages = 39–48 | year = 1981|pmid = 11541716 | doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(81)90241-6}}</ref> Many types of microorganisms have intimate [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with other larger organisms; some of which are mutually beneficial ([[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]), while others can be damaging to the [[host (biology)|host]] organism ([[parasitism]]). If microorganisms can cause [[disease]] in a host they are known as [[pathogen]]s and then they are usually referred to as [[microbes]].

===Extremophiles===
{{Main|Extremophile}}

[[Extremophiles]] are microorganisms that have adapted so that they can survive and even thrive in conditions that are normally fatal to most life-forms. For example, some species have been found in the following extreme environments:
*[[Temperature]]: as high as {{convert|130|°C|°F}},<ref>[[Strain 121]], a [[Hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] [[archaea]], has been shown to reproduce at {{convert|121|°C|°F}}, and survive at {{convert|130|°C|°F}}.[http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/03/pr0384.htm]</ref> as low as {{convert|-17|°C|°F}}<ref>Some [[Psychrophiles|Psychrophilic]] bacteria can grow at {{convert|-17|°C|°F}},[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/827063.stm] and can survive near [[absolute zero]].[http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast01sep98_1.htm]</ref>
*[[Acid]]ity/[[alkalinity]]: less than [[pH]] 0,<ref>[[Picrophilus]] can grow at pH -0.06.[http://www.rcn.montana.edu/resources/organisms/organisminfo.aspx?nav=11&tid=1298&did=1&nid=82076&lid=9]</ref> up to pH 11.5<ref>The [[Alkaliphile|alkaliphilic]] bacteria ''Bacillus alcalophilus'' can grow at up to pH 11.5.[http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/185/2/461.pdf]</ref>
*[[Salinity]]: up to saturation<ref>Dyall-Smith, Mike, [http://www.microbiol.unimelb.edu.au/people/dyallsmith/ ''HALOARCHAEA''], University of Melbourne. See also [[Haloarchaea]].</ref>
*[[Pressure]]: up to 1,000-2,000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], down to 0 atm (e.g. [[vacuum]] of [[Outer space|space]])<ref>The [[Piezophile|piezophilic]] bacteria [[Halomonas salaria]] requires a pressure of 1,000 atm; [[nanobes]], a speculative organism, have been reportedly found in the earth's crust at 2,000 atm.[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/index.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanopaper.html]</ref>
*[[Ionizing radiation|Radiation]]: up to 5k[[Gray (unit)|Gy]]<ref>See [[Deinococcus radiodurans]]</ref>

Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's [[hydrosphere]], [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in [[bio-technology]], and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for [[extraterrestrial life]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cavicchioli R |title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life |journal=Astrobiology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=281–92 |year=2002 |pmid=12530238 |doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode=2002AsBio...2..281C}}</ref>

===Soil microorganisms===
The [[nitrogen cycle]] in soils depends on the [[nitrogen fixation|fixation of atmospheric nitrogen]]. One way this can occur is in the nodules in the roots of [[legumes]] that contain symbiotic [[bacteria]] of the genera ''[[Rhizobium]]'', ''[[Mesorhizobium]]'', ''[[Sinorhizobium]]'', ''[[Bradyrhizobium]]'', and ''[[Azorhizobium]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Barea J, Pozo M, Azcón R, Azcón-Aguilar C | title = Microbial co-operation in the rhizosphere | doi= 10.1093/jxb/eri197 | journal = J Exp Bot | volume = 56 | issue = 417 | pages = 1761–78 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15911555}}</ref>

===Symbiotic microorganisms===
[[Symbiotic]] microbes such as fungi and algae form an association in [[lichen]]. Certain fungi form [[mycorrhiza]]l symbioses with trees that increase the supply of nutrients to the tree.

==Importance==
Microorganisms are vital to humans and the environment, as they participate in the Earth's element cycles such as the [[carbon cycle]] and [[nitrogen cycle]], as well as fulfilling other vital roles in virtually all [[ecosystem]]s, such as recycling other organisms' dead remains and waste products through [[decomposition]]. Microorganisms also have an important place in most higher-order multicellular organisms as [[symbionts]]. Many blame the failure of [[Biosphere 2]] on an improper balance of microorganisms.<ref>{{Cite book| title = The Genesis of Germs: The Origin of Diseases and the Coming Plagues | author = Gillen, Alan L. | publisher = New Leaf Publishing Group | year = 2007 | page = 10 | isbn = 0-89051-493-3}}</ref>

===Use in digestion===
Some forms of bacteria that live in animals' stomachs help in their digestion.For example,cows have a variety of different microbes in their stomachs that aid them in their digestion of grass and hay.

===Use in food===
{{Main|Fermentation (food)}}
Microorganisms are used in [[brewing]], [[winemaking]], [[baking]], [[pickling]] and other [[food]]-making processes.

They are also used to control the [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] process in the production of cultured [[dairy product]]s such as [[yogurt]] and [[cheese]]. The cultures also provide flavour and aroma, and inhibit undesirable organisms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/micro.html |title= Dairy Microbiology |accessdate=9 October 2006 |publisher= University of Guelph}}</ref>

===Use in water treatment===
{{Main|Sewage treatment}}

The majority of all oxidative sewage treatment processes rely on a large range of microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents which are not amenable to sedimentation or flotation. Anaerobic microorganisms are also used to reduce sludge solids producing methane gas (amongst other gases) and a sterile mineralised residue. In [[potable water]] treatment, one method, the [[slow sand filter]], employs a complex gelatinous layer composed of a wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Biology of Wastewater Treatment | author = Gray, N.F. | publisher = Imperial College Press | year = 2004 | page = 1164 | isbn = 1-86094-332-2}}</ref>

===Use in production of chemicals, enzymes etc.===
Many microbes are used for commercial and industrial production of chemicals, [[enzymes]] and other bioactive molecules.<br>
Examples of organic acid produced include
*'''[[Acetic acid]]''': Produced by the bacterium ''[[Acetobacter aceti]]'' and other [[acetic acid bacteria]] (AAB)
*'''[[Butyric acid]]''' (butanoic acid): Produced by the bacterium ''[[Clostridium butyricum]]''
*'''[[Lactic acid]]''':  ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' and others commonly called as [[lactic acid bacteria]] (LAB)
*'''[[Citric acid]]''': Produced by the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]''

Microbes are used for preparation of bioactive molecules and enzymes.
*[[Streptokinase]] produced by the bacterium ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and modified by [[genetic engineering]] is used as a [[clot buster]] for removing clots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone [[myocardial infarctions]] leading to heart attack.
*[[Cyclosporin A]] is a bioactive molecule used as an [[immunosuppressive agent]] in [[organ transplantation]]
*[[Statins]] produced by the yeast ''[[Monascus purpureus]]'' are commercialised as [[blood cholesterol]] lowering agents which act by [[competitive inhibition|competitively inhibiting]] the enzyme responsible for synthesis of cholesterol.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biology textbook for class XII|publisher=National council of educational research and training|isbn=81-7450-639-X|page=183}}</ref>

===Use in science===
Microbes are also essential tools in [[biotechnology]], [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], and [[molecular biology]]. The yeasts (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'') are important [[model organism]]s in science, since they are simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Castrillo JI, Oliver SG |title=Yeast as a touchstone in post-genomic research: strategies for integrative analysis in functional genomics |journal=J.

===Use in warfare===
{{Main|Biological warfare}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], diseased corpses were thrown into castles during [[siege]]s using catapults or other [[siege engine]]s. Individuals near the corpses were exposed to the deadly pathogen and were likely to spread that pathogen to others.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Introduction to Weapons of Mass Destruction: Radiological, Chemical, and Biological | author = Langford, Roland E. | publisher = Wiley-IEEE | year = 2004 | page = 140 | isbn = 0-471-46560-7}}</ref>

==Importance in human health==

=== Human digestion ===
{{Further|Human flora#Human bacterial flora and human health}}
Microorganisms can form an [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] relationship with other, larger organisms. For example, the bacteria that live within the human digestive system contribute to gut immunity, synthesise [[vitamin]]s such as [[folic acid]] and [[biotin]], and ferment complex indigestible [[carbohydrate]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = O'Hara A, Shanahan F | title = The gut flora as a forgotten organ | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 688–93 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16819463 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400731 | pmc = 1500832}}</ref>

===Diseases caused by microbes===
{{Main|Pathogenic microbes}}
Microorganisms are the cause of many infectious diseases. The organisms involved include [[pathogenic bacteria]], causing diseases such as [[bubonic plague|plague]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[anthrax]]; protozoa, causing diseases such as [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[toxoplasmosis]]; and also fungi causing diseases such as [[ringworm]], [[candidiasis]] or [[histoplasmosis]]. However, other diseases such as [[influenza]], [[yellow fever]] or [[AIDS]] are caused by [[pathogenic viruses]], which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. {{As of|2007}}, no clear examples of archaean pathogens are known,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Eckburg P, Lepp P, Relman D |title=Archaea and Their Potential Role in Human Disease |journal=Infect Immun |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=591–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12540534 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.71.2.591-596.2003 |pmc=145348}}</ref> although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human [[periodontal disease]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lepp P, Brinig M, Ouverney C, Palm K, Armitage G, Relman D |title=Methanogenic Archaea and human periodontal disease | doi= 10.1073/pnas.0308766101 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=101 |issue=16 |pages=6176–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15067114 |pmc=395942|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.6176L }}</ref>

==Importance in ecology==
{{Further|Decomposition}}
Microbes are critical to the processes of [[decomposition]] required to cycle nitrogen and other elements back to the natural world.

==Hygiene==
{{Main|Hygiene}}

Hygiene is the avoidance of [[infection]] or [[food]] spoiling by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular [[bacteria]], are found virtually everywhere, the levels of harmful microorganisms can be reduced to acceptable levels. However, in some cases, it is required that an object or substance be completely sterile, i.e. devoid of all living entities and [[virus]]es. A good example of this is a [[hypodermic needle]].

In food preparation microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods (such as the addition of [[vinegar]]), clean utensils used in preparation, short storage periods, or by cool temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, the two most common methods are [[irradiation]] and the use of an [[autoclave]], which resembles a [[pressure cooker]].

There are several methods for investigating the level of hygiene in a sample of food, drinking water, equipment, etc.  Water samples can be filtrated through an extremely fine filter. This filter is then placed in a [[nutrient medium]]. Microorganisms on the filter then grow to form a visible colony. Harmful microorganisms can be detected in food by placing a sample in a [[nutrient broth]] designed to enrich the organisms in question. Various methods, such as [[Selective medium|selective media]] or [[PCR]], can then be used for detection. The hygiene of hard surfaces, such as cooking pots, can be tested by touching them with a solid piece of [[nutrient medium]] and then allowing the microorganisms to grow on it.

There are no conditions where all microorganisms would grow, and therefore often several different methods are needed. For example, a food sample might be analyzed on three different [[nutrient medium]]s designed to indicate the presence of "total" [[bacteria]] (conditions where many, but not all, bacteria grow), [[mold]]s (conditions where the growth of [[bacteria]] is prevented by, e.g., [[antibiotic]]s) and [[Coliform Index|coliform]] [[bacteria]] (these indicate a sewage contamination).
