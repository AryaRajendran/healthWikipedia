For women with '''[[systemic lupus erythematosus]]''' (SLE), '''[[pregnancy]]''' can present some particular challenges for both mother and child. 

While most infants born to mothers who have SLE are healthy, pregnant mothers with SLE should remain under medical care until delivery. In general, women with SLE and, in addition, [[hypertension]], [[proteinuria]], and [[azotemia]] have an extra increased risk for pregnancy complications.<ref name=medscape/> Pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE who receive [[renal transplants]] are similar to those of transplant recipients without SLE.<ref name=medscape/>

Women pregnant and known to have [[Anti-Ro antibodies|anti-Ro]] (SSA) or [[anti-La antibodies]] (SSB) often have echocardiograms during the 16th and 30th weeks of pregnancy to monitor the health of the heart and surrounding vasculature.<ref name=niams>{{cite web |url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Lupus/default.asp |title=Handout on Health: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus |accessdate=2007-11-23 |month=August | year=2003 |work=The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref>

[[Contraception]] and other reliable forms of pregnancy prevention is routinely advised for women with SLE, since getting pregnant during active disease was found to be harmful. [[Lupus nephritis]] was the most common manifestation.

Of live births, approximately one third are delivered [[premature birth|prematurely]].<ref name=medscape/>

==Miscarriage==
SLE causes an increased rate of fetal death ''in utero'' and [[spontaneous abortion]] (miscarriage). The overall live-birth rate in SLE patient has been estimated to be 72%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smyth|first=Andrew|coauthors=Guilherme H.M. Oliveira, Brian D. Lahr, Kent R. Bailey, Suzanne M.

Miscarriages in the [[first trimester]] appear either to have no known cause or to be associated with signs of active SLE.<ref name=hopkins>[http://www.hopkinslupus.org/lupus-info/lifestyle-additional-information/lupus-pregnancy/ Lupus and Pregnancy] by Michelle Petri. The Johns Hopkins Lupus Center. Retrieved May 2011</ref> Later losses appear to occur primarily due to the [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], in spite of treatment with [[heparin]] and [[aspirin]].<ref name=hopkins/> All women with lupus, even those without previous history of miscarriage, are recommended to be screened for [[antiphospholipid antibodies]], both the [[lupus anticoagulant]] (the RVVT and sensitive PTT are the best screening battery) and [[anticardiolipin antibodies]].<ref name=hopkins/>

==Neonatal lupus==
[[Neonatal lupus]] is the occurrence of SLE symptoms in an [[infant]] born from a mother with SLE, most commonly presenting with a rash resembling [[discoid lupus erythematosus]], and sometimes with systemic abnormalities such as [[heart block]] or [[hepatosplenomegaly]].<ref name=Dorlands>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/neonatal+lupus thefreedictionary.com > neonatal lupus] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. Copyright 2007</ref> Neonatal lupus is usually benign and self-limited.<ref name=Dorlands/> Still, identification of mothers at highest risk for complications allows for prompt treatment before or after birth. In addition, SLE can flare up during pregnancy, and proper treatment can maintain the health of the mother for longer.

==Aggravation of SLE==
Aggravation (or exacerbation) of SLE has been estimated to occur in about 20-30% pregnancies where the mother has SLE.<ref name=medscape/> Increased disease activity of SLE is expected during pregnancy because of increased levels of [[estrogen]], [[prolactin]], and certain [[cytokines]].<ref name=medscape/> However, a long time of remission before pregnancy decreases the risk of aggravation, with an incidence of 7-33% in women who have been in remission for at least 6 months, and an incidence of 61-67% in women who have active SLE at the time of conception.<ref name=medscape/>

Renal disease flare-up is the most common presentation of SLE aggravation in pregnancy, and is seen equally in United States and European populations.<ref name=medscape/> [[Serositis]] with [[pleural effusion|pleural]] and [[pericardial effusion]]s are seen in up to 10% of these patients.<ref name=medscape/>

On the other hand, flares of SLE are uncommon during pregnancy and are often easily treated.<ref name=medscape/> The most common symptoms of these flares include [[arthritis]], [[rash]]es, and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name=medscape>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/335055-overview Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Pregnancy] at Medscape. Author: Ritu Khurana. Chief Editor: David Chelmow. Updated: Sep 20, 2010</ref>

Also, in the [[postpartum period]], there  may be exacerbations of SLE due to decreased levels of anti-inflammatory steroids, elevated levels of [[prolactin]] and [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] changes.<ref name=medscape/>

In diagnosing an aggravation of SLE in pregnancy, there need to be a [[differential diagnosis]] from SLE-unrelated [[complications of pregnancy]] that may appear in a similar fashion. For example, [[chloasma]] may appear like the [[malar rash]] of SLE, [[proteinuria]] from [[preeclampsia]] may appear like that of [[lupus nephritis]], thrombocytopenia of the [[HELLP syndrome]] may appear like that of SLE, and pregnancy-related edema of joints can appear like arthritis of SLE.<ref name=medscape/>

==General preventive measures==
Continuing [[glucocorticoid]]s at the lowest effective dose and/or cautious use of [[azathioprine]] may be preferred in some patients, but needs to be weighed against potential adverse effects of such medications.<ref name=medscape/>
