In [[medicine]], '''ischemia''',  also spelled as '''ischaemia''' or '''ischæmia''', ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|s|k|iː|m|ɪ|ə}};<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ischemia Entry "ischemia"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref> from [[Greek language]] ισχαιμία, ''ischaimía''; ''isch-'' root denoting a restriction or thinning or to make or grow thin/lean, ''haema'' [[blood]]) is a restriction in blood supply to [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, causing a shortage of [[oxygen]] and [[glucose]] needed for [[cellular metabolism]] (to keep tissue alive).<ref>Merck & Co. [http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/heart_and_blood_vessel_disorders/peripheral_arterial_disease/occlusive_peripheral_arterial_disease.html#v722187 Occlusive Peripheral Arterial Disease], The Merck Manual Home Health Handbook website, revised and updated March 2010. Retrieved March 4, 2012.</ref>  Ischemia is generally caused by problems with [[blood vessel]]s, with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue. It also means '''local anemia''' in a given part of a body sometimes resulting from congestion (such as [[vasoconstriction]], [[thrombosis]] or [[embolism]]).

==Causes==
An inadequate flow of blood to a part of the body may be caused by any of the following:
* [[Thoracic outlet syndrome]] (compression of the [[brachial plexus]])
* [[Atherosclerosis]] (lipid-laden plaques obstructing the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of [[artery|arteries]])
* [[Hypoglycemia]] (lower than normal level of glucose)
* [[Tachycardia]] (abnormally rapid beating of the [[heart]])
* [[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure, e.g. in [[septic shock]], heart failure)
* [[Thromboembolism]] (blood clots)

* Outside compression of a blood vessel, e.g. by a [[tumor]] or in the case of [[superior mesenteric artery syndrome]]
* [[Embolism]] (foreign bodies in the circulation, e.g. [[amniotic fluid embolism]])
* [[Sickle cell disease]] (abnormally shaped red blood cells)
* Induced [[g-force]]s which restrict the blood flow and force the blood to the extremities of the body, as in acrobatics and military flying
* Localized extreme cold, such as by [[frostbite]] or improper [[cold compression therapy]]
* [[Tourniquet]] application
* An increased level of [[glutamate receptor]] stimulation
* [[Arteriovenous malformation]]s, and [[peripheral artery occlusive disease]]
* [[Hemorrhage|rupture of significant blood vessels]] supplying a tissue or organ.
* [[Anemia]] vasoconstricts the periphery so that red blood cells can work internally on vital organs such as the heart, brain, etc., thus causing lack of oxygen to the periphery.

== Consequences ==
{{further|ischemic cascade|stroke|heart attack}}

Since oxygen is carried to tissues in the [[red blood cell|blood]], insufficient blood supply causes tissue to become [[Hypoxia (medical)|starved of oxygen]]. In the highly [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] tissues of the [[heart]] and [[brain]], irreversible damage to tissues can occur in as little as 3–4 minutes at body temperature. The [[kidney]]s are also quickly damaged by loss of blood flow.  Tissues with slower metabolic rates may undergo irreversible damage after 20 minutes.

Ischemia results in tissue damage in a process known as [[ischemic cascade]]. The damage is the result of the build-up of [[metabolic waste]] products, inability to maintain [[cell membranes]], [[mitochondria]]l damage, and eventual leakage of [[Autolysis (biology)|autolyzing]] [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] [[enzymes]] into the cell and surrounding tissues.  

Restoration of blood supply to ischemic tissues can cause additional damage known as [[reperfusion injury]] that can be more damaging than the initial ischemia. Reintroduction of blood flow brings oxygen back to the tissues, causing a greater production of [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] and [[reactive oxygen species]] that damage cells.  It also brings more calcium ions to the tissues causing further calcium overloading and can result in potentially fatal [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s and also accelerates cellular [[apoptosis|self-destruction]]. The restored blood flow also exaggerates the [[inflammation]] response of damaged tissues, causing [[macrophage|white blood cells]] to destroy damaged cells that may otherwise still be viable.<ref>

=== Cardiac ischemia === <!--Cardiac ischemia redirects here-->
{{see also|Myocardial infarction}}
Cardiac ischemia may be asymptomatic or may cause chest pain, known as [[angina pectoris]]. It occurs when the heart muscle, or [[myocardium]], receives insufficient blood flow. This most frequently results from [[atherosclerosis]], which is the long-term accumulation of cholesterol-rich plaques in the [[coronary arteries]]. [[Ischemic heart disease]] is the most common cause of death in most Western countries and a major cause of hospital admissions.<ref name=WHO>

=== Bowel ===

Both large and small bowel can be affected by ischemia. Ischemia of the [[large intestine]] may result in an inflammatory process known as [[ischemic colitis]]. Ischemia of the small bowel is called [[mesenteric ischemia]].

=== Brain ===

[[Brain ischemia]] is insufficient blood flow to the [[brain]], and can be acute (i.e., rapid) or chronic (i.e., long-lasting). Acute [[ischemic stroke]] is a neurologic emergency that may be reversible if treated rapidly. Chronic ischemia of the brain may result in a form of [[dementia]] called [[vascular dementia]]. A brief episode of ischemia affecting the brain is called a [[Transient Ischemic Attack]] (TIA), frequently referred to as a mini-stroke.

=== Limb ===
{{main|Acute limb ischaemia}}

Lack of blood flow to a limb results in acute limb ischemia.

=== Cutaneous ===

Reduced blood flow to the skin layers may result in [[mottling]] or uneven, patchy discoloration of the skin

== Treatment ==

Decrease in body temperature reduces the aerobic metabolic rate of the affected cells, reducing the immediate effects of hypoxia.  Reduction of body temperature also reduces the inflammation response and reperfusion injury.  

For frostbite injuries, limiting thawing and warming of tissues until warmer temperatures can be sustained may reduce reperfusion injury. 

For blood clots, administration of "clot-buster" drugs such as [[Alteplase]] within the critical time period, together with some collateral circulation to the ischemic area is a main factor in patient recoveries.

Other drug therapies such as [[Cannabinoid#U.S. Patent no. 6630507|cannabinoids]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] are being researched for limiting ischemic injuries.
