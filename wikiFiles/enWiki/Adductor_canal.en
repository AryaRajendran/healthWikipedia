The '''adductor canal''' ('''subsartorial or Hunter’s canal''') is an [[aponeurotic]] tunnel in the middle third of the [[thigh]], extending from the apex of the [[femoral triangle]] to the opening in the [[adductor magnus]], the [[adductor hiatus]]. 

==Boundary==
It courses between the [[anterior compartment of thigh]] and the [[medial compartment of thigh]], and has the following boundaries:

* anteriorly and laterally - the [[vastus medialis]]. 
* posteriorly - the [[adductor longus]] and the [[adductor magnus]]. 
* roof and medially- the [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]].

It is covered in by a strong aponeurosis which extends from the [[vastus medialis]], across the femoral vessels to the [[adductor longus]] and magnus.

* Lying on the aponeurosis is the [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius (tailor's) muscle]].

==Contents==
The canal contains the [[femoral artery]], [[femoral vein]], and branches of the [[femoral nerve]] (specifically, the [[saphenous nerve]], and the [[nerve to the Vastus medialis|nerve to the vastus medialis]]).<ref name="isbn0-7817-5484-4">{{cite book |author=Sauerland, Eberhardt K.; Patrick W., PhD.

The femoral artery with its vein and the saphenous nerve enter this canal through the superior [[foramen]]. Then, the saphenous nerve and artery and vein of genus descendens exit through the anterior foramen, piercing the vastoadductor intermuscular septum. Finally, the femoral artery and vein exit via the inferior foramen (usually called the [[Adductor hiatus|hiatus]]) through the inferior space between the oblique and medial heads of adductor magnus.<ref name="isbn978-5-9704-1207-7">{{cite book |author=А.В.

<!--Commented out: unclear, unref'd "Snell anatomy--it also contains deep lymphatic vessels and terminal part of obturator nerve"-->

==Eponym==
The eponym Hunter’s canal is named for [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|105}}</ref><ref name="titleCHAPTER 15: THE THIGH AND KNEE">{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/part_3/chapter_15.html#chpt_15_adductor_canal |title=CHAPTER 15: THE THIGH AND KNEE |accessdate=2008-01-27 |format= |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080121162834/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/part_3/chapter_15.html| archivedate= 21 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
