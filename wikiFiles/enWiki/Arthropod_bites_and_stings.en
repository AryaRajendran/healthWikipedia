Many species of [[arthropods]] (insects, arachnids and others) regularly or occasionally bite or sting human beings. Insect saliva contains [[anticoagulant]]s and enzymes that cause local irritation and [[allergic reaction]]s.<ref name = Atkins>{{cite book |title=Insects in Perspective  |last=Atkins |first=Michael D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=978-0-02-304500-4 |page=359 |url= |accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> [[Insect venom]]s can be delivered by their stingers, which often are modified [[ovipositor]]s, or by their mouthparts. Insect, spider and scorpion venom can cause serious injury or death. [[Dipterans]] account for the majority of [[insect bites]], while [[Hymenopterans]] account for the majority of stings. Among arachnids [[spider bites]] are the most common. Arthropods bite or sting humans for a number of reasons including feeding or defense. Arthropods are major [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s of human disease, with the pathogens typically transmitted by bites.
