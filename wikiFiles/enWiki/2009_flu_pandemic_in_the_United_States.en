The '''2009 flu pandemic in the United States''' was a [[pandemic]] experienced in the [[United States]] of a novel strain of the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1#2009 Influenza A.28H1N1.29 pandemic|Influenza A/H1N1]] virus, commonly referred to as '[[swine flu]]', that began in the spring of 2009. The virus had spread to the US from an [[2009 swine flu outbreak in Mexico|outbreak in Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Outbreak of Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1n1) Virus Infection|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0430a2.htm|publisher=CDC|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=June 11, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090606130423/http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0430a2.htm| archivedate= 6 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

As of mid-March 2010, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) estimated that about 59 million Americans contracted the H1N1 virus, 265,000 were hospitalized as a result, and 12,000 died.<ref>{{cite news| title=Swine flu danger appears to be ebbing |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/19/science/la-sci-swine-flu20-2010mar20 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=March 19, 2010| author= Thomas H.

Towards the middle of June 2009, the number of US cases surpassed those of Mexico, which had been the previous leader in diagnosed cases of the disease. Toward the end of June 2009, the number of deaths related to the virus in the US surpassed those of all other countries as well.

On June 25, the CDC released information revealing that there were more than likely over one million (1,000,000) cases of the disease in the US, most of which had not been reported or diagnosed.<ref>{{cite web|title=1 Million Americans Likely Stricken by Swine Flu: CDC|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=June 25, 2009|date=June 25, 2009|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/hscout/2009/06/25/hscout628467.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090627123015/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/hscout/2009/06/25/hscout628467.html| archivedate= 27 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=US Swine Flu Cases May Have Hit 1 Million|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=June 25, 2009|date=June 25, 2009|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hjdCHrP82YTFser5vD6CzTK1az6wD991UK9O1}}</ref>

Deaths relating to this new strain of influenza began appearing in the US in late April, and by early June 15, states had reported fatalities related to or directly occurring from the virus.  These deaths totaled at 4,000 as of November 15, 2009.<ref name="Wiki-Template" />

On October 24, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] declared Swine Flu a national emergency in the United States.

On November 12, 2009, the CDC reported an estimated 22 million Americans had been infected with 2009 A H1N1 and 4,000 Americans have died.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/media/transcripts/2009/t091112.htm</ref>

On December 10, 2009, the CDC reported an estimated 50 million Americans or 1-6 people had been infected with the 2009 A H1N1 Virus and 10,000 American have died, by which time the vaccine was beginning to be widely distributed to the general public by several states.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AO3Z420091210 | work=Reuters | title=Swine flu has killed 10,000 Americans since April | date=2009-12-10| accessdate= 13 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091217193529/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AO3Z420091210?| archivedate= 17 December 2009| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On December 23, 2009 the CDC reported the Reduction of The Disease by 59% percent and only 3 states reporting widespread
and the disease is expected to end in The United States in January 2010.

On January 15, 2010, the CDC released new estimate figures for swine flu, saying it has sickened about 55 million Americans and killed about 11,160 from April through mid-December.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34880176/ns/health-cold_and_flu</ref>

On February 12, 2010, the CDC released updated estimate figures for swine flu, reporting that, in total, 57 million Americans had been sickened, 257,000 had been hospitalised and 11,690 people had died (including 1,180 children) due to swine flu from April through to mid-January.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35367744/ns/health-cold_and_flu/</ref>

==Initial cases==
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified the first two A/09(H1N1) swine flu cases in California on April 17, 2009, via the Border Infectious Disease Program,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2009/may/07/border-disease-program-helped-sound-alarm-swine-fl/ |title=Border Disease Program Helped Sound Alarm on Swine Flu |accessdate=2010-09-02 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher=KPBS San Diego |pages= |quote= }}</ref> for the San Diego County child, and a naval research facility studying a special diagnostic test, where influenza sample from the child from Imperial County was tested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/transcripts/2009/t090423.htm|title=CDC Briefing on Public Health Investigation of Human Cases of Swine Influenza|publisher=CDC|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=April 26, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090426093348/http://www.cdc.gov/media/transcripts/2009/t090423.htm| archivedate= 26 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> By April 21, enhanced surveillance was established to search for additional cases in both California and Texas and the CDC determined that the virus strain was genetically similar to the previously known A(H1N1) swine flu circulating among pigs in the United States since about 1999.

It was established that the virus was a combination of human, North American swine, and Eurasian swine influenza viruses; the viruses from the initial two Californian cases were also noted to be resistant to [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]], two common influenza antiviral drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm|title=Swine Influenza A (H1N1) Infection in Two Children --- Southern California, March--April 2009|publisher=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|author=CDC|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=April 26, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090426212017/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm| archivedate= 26 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> No contact with pigs was found for any of the seven Californian nor either of the two Texas cases, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus.

On April 28, 2009, the director of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] confirmed the first official US death of swine flu. Tests confirmed that a 23-month old toddler from Mexico, who was probably infected there, died on April 27 from the flu while visiting Texas.<ref name="fatality1">{{cite news | url = http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/29/swine-flu-fatality-in-texas-likely-infected-in-mexico-official-says/ | work=CNN | title=Swine flu fatality in Texas likely infected in Mexico, official says| accessdate= 24 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Changes in surveillance of cases of [[influenza-like illness]], including new guidelines for identifying cases to test, increased laboratory testing, and new test kits able to distinguish this novel strain, resulted in a spike in the percent of cases tested positive for influenza.

The proportion of US deaths due to pneumonia and influenza climbed above the epidemic threshold in the 2007–2008 winter flu season but not in the 2008–2009 season.  Although the 2009 H1N1 outbreak reached epidemic levels of infection early in 2009, it did not contribute to epidemic levels of pneumonia and influenza related deaths until October 2009.

===The second wave===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
{{Out of date|section|date=November 2010}}
In early October 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that swine flu was widespread across the country. It also said there was significant flu activity in virtually all states, which was considered to be quite unusual for this time of year. There was particular worry about pregnant women. As of late August, 100 had been hospitalized in intensive care units and 28 had died since the beginning of the outbreak in April. On October 1, it was acknowledged that a recruit in basic training in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, was the Army's first swine flu death. The recruit fell ill on September 1 and died of pneumonia on September 10.

[[Seton Family of Hospitals|Dell Children's Medical Center]] in Austin, Texas, erected two tents in its parking lot to handle emergency room visits, and hospitals around Colorado Springs recorded a 30 percent spike in flu visits. As pediatric cases were increasing, the Dept. of Health and Human Services released 300,000 courses of children's liquid Tamiflu from the national pandemic stockpile in late September, with the first batches sent to Texas and Colorado.

In late September, the disease centers reported that 936 had died of flu symptoms or of flu-associated pneumonia since August 30, when it began a new count of deaths, including some without laboratory-confirmed swine flu.<ref name=NYT10022009>{{cite news|title=Swine Flu Spread Prompts Move on Vaccine |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-10-02 |author=Donald G. McNeil Jr.|accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref>

The Agriculture Department reported on October 16 that three pigs at the Minnesota State Fair, in St. Paul, were tested positive in late August for H1N1 virus, which were the first cases in the country, although infected pigs had been found in eight other countries. There were 103 pigs tested at the Fair, including the three infected, though all appeared healthy. Scientists said the virus was already spreading widely among people, and, in fact, was more common in humans than in pigs, so humans were more likely to catch it from others than from pigs.<ref name=NYT1017pig>{{cite news|title=Three Pigs May be the First in the U.S. With Swine Flu |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-10-17 |author=Denise Grady |accessdate=2009-10-27}}</ref>

In mid-October, it was reported that flu caused by the H1N1 virus was widespread in 41 states, and flu-like illnesses accounted for 6.1 percent of all doctor visits, which was considered high{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, particularly for October. Forty-three children had died from H1N1 since August 30, which is approximately the number that usually dies in an entire flu season.  Nineteen of the forty-three were teenagers while sixteen were between ages five to eleven. The rest were under five.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  It is reported that the severity of the disease was not increasing. About fifteen to twenty percent of the patients hospitalized for the flu were placed in the intensive care unit, a level similar to that for seasonal flu.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

[[Image:BoiseH1N1VaccinationClinic5578.JPG|right|thumb|High-risk groups line up at a defunct Kmart on October 24, 2009 for the first H1N1 vaccines publicly available in Boise, Idaho.]]
Projections of the supply of H1N1 vaccine had decreased significantly from a level of 120 million doses ready in October, estimated during the summer, to an estimate of 28 to 30 million doses by the end of the month. On October 14, 11.4 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine were said to be available. As of November 20, 2009, the CDC reported sharp declines in H1N1 activity throughout the United States, with influenza like illness (which may also include meningitis, pneumonia, strep pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and the common cold) accounting for 5.5% of doctors visits, down sharply from 8% in late October, the peak of the second wave. However, taking the vaccine is still urged by the CDC, as a third wave of the disease may sweep across the US, possibly in January/February 2010.<ref name="thirdwave">{{cite news| url=http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/article_a3f8bc1e-7237-58ee-9b46-e1bc6e79579a.html|title=Official warns 'third wave' of H1N1 on the way|work=Sioux City Journal News|date=2008-12-15|accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref>
as of December 24,the second wave of H1N1 has clearly peaked,with [[pneumonia]] and influenza deaths falling below the epidemic threshold for the first time in 11 weeks,and the proportion of doctors visits do to [[influenza like illness]] falling to baseline (2.3%),down from 5.5% 1 month before,on November 20.however,it was reported that influenza activity was beginning to increase in West Virginia,with 5.2% of patients treated by West Virginia health care providers having influenza like illness,an major increase from 2% of patients treated by West Virginia health care providers having influenza like illness in November.

==Flu strain severity==
[[File:IPD40.GIF|thumb|Influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported to CDC, from 2005–06 to start of 2009–2010]]
The new strain was identified as a combination of several different strains of [[Influenzavirus A]], subtype [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]], including separate strains of this subtype circulating in humans (see [[human influenza]]) and in pigs (see [[swine influenza]]). The strain transmits between humans and was initially reported to have a relatively high [[mortality rate]] in Mexico. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) have expressed serious concerns that the new strain has the potential to become an [[influenza pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/transcripts/2009/t090424.htm|title=CDC Press Briefing Transcripts|publisher=CDC|date=January 23, 2009|accessdate=April 25, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090428151540/http://www.cdc.gov/media/transcripts/2009/t090424.htm| archivedate= 28 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is reported that, because the virus is already widespread, containment will be impossible.<ref>{{cite web|author=Laura Kennedy|title=Swine Flu Spreading In The U.S.|date=April 25, 2009|publisher=WDIO-TV|accessdate=April 26, 2009|url=http://www.wdio.com/article/stories/S899045.shtml?cat=10335| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090504024603/http://www.wdio.com/article/stories/S899045.shtml?cat=10335| archivedate= 4 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In addition, the flu death toll in Mexico could be lower than first thought, Dr. Gregory Evans, head of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada and a member of a federal pandemic-planning committee, said on April 29:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1547114|title=Flu death toll in Mexico could be lower than first thought|publisher=National Post, Canada|date=|accessdate=2009-04-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090503223316/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1547114| archivedate= 3 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref>

<blockquote>There was a lot of speculation and what seemed to be evidence there were dozens and dozens of deaths. Careful analysis showed these people likely died of something else, and not influenza. That's really good news, and that would fit with what we've seen outside of Mexico.</blockquote>

Moreover, another Canadian expert, Dr. Neil Rau, criticized the WHO's decision to raise its Pandemic alert to level 5, saying:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090429/WHO_panic_090429/20090429?hub=Health|title=Seasonal flu killing much more than swine flu|publisher=CTV, Canada|date=|accessdate=2009-04-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090502084811/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090429/WHO_panic_090429/20090429?hub=Health| archivedate= 2 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
<blockquote>
I don't agree with (the WHO) because I think it's a panic metre, not a pandemic metre. [...] If that flu-like illness is not deadly, I don't know what the cause for alarm is for people who are not really sickened by this virus. [...] I'm really eager to know how much worse this is than seasonal flu. So far it's looking like it's not that serious.

;Activation of Emergency Operations Center
During the week of April 19, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to augment the ongoing investigation of human cases of swine influenza A (H1N1).

;Influenza Reporting Requirements
In the United States, the majority of the 70 National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories do not report the influenza A subtype.

However, in 2007, human infection with a novel [[influenzavirus A]] became a nationally notifiable condition. Novel influenza A virus infections include all human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human influenza H1 and H3 viruses. These viruses include those that are subtyped as nonhuman in origin and those that are unsubtypable with standard methods and reagents.<ref>{{cite web
