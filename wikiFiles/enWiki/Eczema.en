The term ''eczema'' is broadly applied to a range of persistent skin conditions. These include dryness and recurring skin [[rash]]es that are characterized by one or more of these [[symptom]]s: redness, skin [[edema]] (swelling), itching and dryness, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding. Areas of temporary skin discoloration may appear and are sometimes due to healed [[injury|injuries]]. Scratching open a healing [[lesion]] may result in scarring and may enlarge the rash.

The word ''eczema'' comes from Greek, meaning "to boil over". Dermatitis comes from the Greek word for skin{{spaced ndash}}and both terms refer to the same skin condition. In some languages, [[dermatitis]] and eczema are synonymous, while in other languages dermatitis implies an [[Acute (medicine)|acute condition]] and "eczema" a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] one.<ref name="RingPrzybilla2006">{{cite book|author1=Johannes Ring|author2=Bernhard Przybilla|author3=Thomas Ruzicka|title=Handbook of atopic eczema|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jTktMX60bPwC&pg=PA4|accessdate=4 May 2010|year=2006|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-540-23133-2|page=4}}</ref> The two conditions are often classified together.

==Classification==
[[Image:Eczema-arms.jpg|thumb|right|More severe eczema]]
[[Image:Eczema.jpg|thumb|right|A patch of eczema that has been scratched]]
The term eczema refers to a set of clinical characteristics. Classification of the underlying diseases has been haphazard and unsystematic, with many [[synonym]]s used to describe the same condition. A type of eczema may be described by location (e.g., hand eczema), by specific appearance (eczema [[craquelure|craquele]] or discoid), or by possible cause (varicose eczema). Further adding to the confusion, many sources use the term eczema for the most common type of eczema ([[atopic dermatitis]]) interchangeably.

The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) published a position paper in 2001 which simplifies the nomenclature of allergy-related diseases including atopic and allergic contact eczemas.<ref name="pmid11551246">{{cite journal |author=Johansson SG, Hourihane JO, Bousquet J, ''et al.'' |title=A revised nomenclature for allergy. An EAACI position statement from the EAACI nomenclature task force |journal=Allergy |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=813–24 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11551246 |doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.2001.t01-1-00001.x }}</ref> Non-allergic eczemas are not affected by this proposal.

The classifications below is ordered by incidence frequency.

===Common===
* '''[[Atopic eczema]]''' (aka infantile e., flexural e., atopic dermatitis) is an allergic disease believed to have a hereditary component and often runs in families whose members also have [[asthma]]. Itchy [[rash]] is particularly noticeable on head and scalp, neck, inside of elbows, behind knees, and buttocks. Experts{{who|date=November 2012}} are urging doctors to be more vigilant in weeding out cases that are, in actuality, [[irritant contact dermatitis]]. It is very common in developed countries, and rising. (L20)
* '''[[Contact dermatitis]]''' is of two types: allergic (resulting from a delayed reaction to some [[allergen]], such as [[poison ivy]] or [[nickel]]), and irritant (resulting from direct reaction to a detergent, such as [[sodium lauryl sulfate]], for example). Some substances act both as allergen and irritant (wet cement, for example). Other substances cause a problem after sunlight exposure, bringing on phototoxic dermatitis. About three quarters of cases of contact eczema are of the irritant type, which is the most common occupational skin disease. Contact eczema is curable, provided the offending substance can be avoided and its traces removed from one's environment. (L23; L24; L56.1; L56.0)
* '''[[Xerotic eczema]]''' (aka asteatotic e., e. craquele or craquelatum, winter itch, pruritus hiemalis) is dry skin that becomes so serious it turns into eczema. It worsens in dry winter weather, and limbs and trunk are most often affected. The itchy, tender skin resembles a dry, cracked, river bed. This disorder is very common among the older population. [[Ichthyosis]] is a related disorder. (L30.8A; L85.0)
* '''[[Seborrhoeic dermatitis]]''' or '''Seborrheic dermatitis''' ("[[cradle cap]]" in infants) is a condition sometimes classified as a form of eczema that is closely related to [[dandruff]]. It causes dry or greasy peeling of the scalp, eyebrows, and face, and sometimes trunk. The condition is harmless except in severe cases of cradle cap. In newborns it causes a thick, yellow crusty scalp rash called cradle cap, which seems related to lack of [[biotin]] and is often curable. (L21; L21.0)

===Less common===
* '''[[Dyshidrosis]]''' (aka dyshidrotic e., pompholyx, vesicular palmoplantar dermatitis, housewife's eczema) only occurs on palms, soles, and sides of fingers and toes. Tiny opaque bumps called [[Cutaneous conditions#Morphology|vesicle]]s, thickening, and cracks are accompanied by itching, which gets worse at night. A common type of hand eczema, it worsens in warm weather. (L30.1)
* '''[[nummular dermatitis|Discoid eczema]]''' (aka nummular e., exudative e., microbial e.) is characterized by round spots of oozing or dry rash, with clear boundaries, often on lower legs. It is usually worse in winter. Cause is unknown, and the condition tends to come and go. (L30.0)
* '''[[stasis dermatitis|Venous eczema]]''' (aka gravitational e., stasis dermatitis, varicose e.) occurs in people with impaired circulation, varicose veins and edema, and is particularly common in the ankle area of people over 50. There is redness, scaling, darkening of the skin and itching. The disorder predisposes to [[venous ulcer|leg ulcers]]. (I83.1)
* '''[[Dermatitis herpetiformis]]''' (aka Duhring's Disease) causes intensely itchy and typically symmetrical rash on arms, thighs, knees, and back. It is directly related to [[celiac disease]], can often be put into remission with appropriate diet, and tends to get worse at night. (L13.0)
* '''[[Neurodermatitis]]''' (aka [[lichen simplex chronicus]], localized scratch dermatitis) is an itchy area of thickened, pigmented eczema patch that results from [[habit (psychology)|habitual]] rubbing and scratching. Usually there is only one spot. Often curable through behavior modification and anti-inflammatory medication. [[Prurigo nodularis]] is a related disorder showing multiple lumps. (L28.0; L28.1)
* '''[[Autoeczematization]]''' (aka id reaction, autosensitization) is an eczematous reaction to an infection with parasites, fungi, bacteria or viruses. It is completely curable with the clearance of the original infection that caused it. The appearance varies depending on the cause. It always occurs some distance away from the original infection. (L30.2)
* There are also eczemas overlaid by viral infections ([[eczema herpeticum|e. herpeticum]], [[eczema vaccinatum|e. vaccinatum]]), and eczemas resulting from underlying disease (e.g. [[lymphoma]]). Eczemas originating from ingestion of medications, foods, and chemicals, have not yet been clearly systematized. Other rare eczematous disorders exist in addition to those listed here.

==Cause==
[[File:PLJohnson Complex Eczema.jpg|thumb|Complex eczema treated with a combination of [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] and [[corticosteroid]] creams concurrently.]]
The cause of eczema is unknown but is presumed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atopic dermatitis|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Atopic_Dermatitis/default.asp|work=National Institute of Health|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref>

The [[hygiene hypothesis]] postulates that the cause of [[asthma]], eczema, and other allergic diseases is an unusually clean environment. It is supported by epidemiologic studies for asthma.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bufford | first=JD | coauthors=Gern JE | title=The hygiene hypothesis revisited | journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | volume=25 | issue=2 | pages=247–262 | month=May | year=2005 | pmid=15878454 | doi=10.1016/j.iac.2005.03.005 }}</ref> The hypothesis states that exposure to bacteria and other immune system modulators is important during development, and missing out on this exposure increases risk for asthma and allergy.

While it has been suggested that eczema may sometimes be an allergic reaction to the [[excrement]] from [[house dust mite]]s,<ref name="pmid2873316">{{cite journal |author=Carswell F, Thompson S |title=Does natural sensitisation in eczema occur through the skin? |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8497 |pages=13–5 |year=1986 |pmid=2873316 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(86)92560-2}}</ref> with up to 5% of people showing antibodies to the mites,<ref name="pmid17633128">{{cite journal |author=Henszel Ł, Kuźna-Grygiel W |title=[House dust mites in the etiology of allergic diseases] |language=Polish |journal=Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=123–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17633128}}</ref> the overall role this plays awaits further corroboration.<ref>{{eMedicine|Derm|38|Atopic Dermatitis}}</ref>

Researchers have compared the prevalence of eczema in people who also suffer from [[celiac]] disease to eczema prevalence in control subjects, and have found that eczema occurs about three times more frequently in celiac disease patients and about two times more frequently in relatives of celiac patients, potentially indicating a [[Heredity|genetic]] link between the two conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ciacci|first=C|coauthors=Cavallaro R, Iovino P, Sabbatini F, Palumbo A, Amoruso D, Tortora R, Mazzacca G.|title=Allergy prevalence in adult celiac disease|journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol|year=2004|month=June|volume=113|pages=1199–203|accessdate=27 September 2011|pmid=15208605|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.03.012|issue=6}}</ref>

The failure of the body to metabolize linoleic acid into y-linoleic acid (GLA) may be a cause of eczema, and administration of GLAs has been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms. Eczema may be in some cases caused by an inherited abnormality of essential fatty accid metabolism.<ref>{{cite pmid | 10617999}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on history and physical examination. However, in uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be useful.

==Prevention==
Those with eczema should not get the smallpox vaccination due to risk of developing [[eczema vaccinatum]], a potentially severe and sometimes fatal complication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/contraindications-clinic.asp |title=CDC Smallpox &#124; Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine Contraindications (Info for Clinicians) |publisher=Emergency.cdc.gov |date=2007-02-07 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for eczema; therefore, treatments aim to control the symptoms by reducing inflammation and relieving itching.

===Medications===

====Corticosteroids====
[[Corticosteroids]] are highly effective in controlling or suppressing symptoms in most cases.<ref name="pmid11134919">{{cite journal |author=Hoare C, Li Wan Po A, Williams H |title=Systematic review of treatments for atopic eczema |journal=Health Technology Assessment |volume=4 |issue=37 |pages=1–191 |year=2000 |pmid=11134919 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/execsumm/summ437.htm}}</ref> For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g. [[hydrocortisone]]), while in more severe cases a higher-potency steroid (e.g. [[clobetasol propionate]]) may be used. In severe cases, oral or injectable corticosteroids may be used. While these usually bring about rapid improvements, they have greater side effects.

=====Side effects=====
[[File:atrophied skin.png|thumb|Lower arm of a 47-year-old female showing skin damage due to topical steroid use]]
Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids is thought to increase the risk of side effects, the most common of which is the skin becoming thin and fragile ([[atrophy]]).<ref name="pmid14576221">{{cite journal |author=Atherton DJ |title=Topical corticosteroids in atopic dermatitis |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7421 |pages=942–3 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14576221 |pmc=259155 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7421.942}}</ref>
Because of this, if used on the face or other delicate skin, only a low-strength steroid should be used. Additionally, high-strength steroids used over large areas, or under [[occlusive dressing|occlusion]], may be significantly absorbed into the body, causing [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] suppression (HPA axis suppression).<ref name="Lee">{{cite journal |author=Lee NP, Arriola ER |title=Topical corticosteroids: back to basics |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=171 |issue=5-6 |pages=351–3 |year=1999 |pmid=10639873 |pmc=1308757}}</ref>
Finally by their immunosuppressive action they can, if used without [[antibiotic]]s or [[antifungal drug]]s, lead to some skin infections ([[fungal]] or [[bacteria]]l). Care must be taken to avoid the eyes, as topical corticosteroids applied to the eye can cause [[glaucoma]] <ref>{{cite web |title= neomycin and polymyxin b sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate (Neomycin sulfate and Polymyxin B Sulfate, Bacitracin zinc and Hydrocortisone Acetate) ointment -- Warnings|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=1932#nlm34071-1| publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref> or cataracts.

Because of the risks associated with this type of drug, a steroid of an appropriate strength should be sparingly applied only to control an episode of eczema. Once the desired response has been achieved, it should be discontinued and replaced with [[emollient]]s as maintenance therapy. Corticosteroids are generally considered safe to use in the short- to medium-term for controlling eczema, with no significant side effects differing from treatment with non-steroidal ointment.<ref name="pmid10354080">{{cite journal |author=Van Der Meer JB, Glazenburg EJ, Mulder PG, Eggink HF, Coenraads PJ |title=The management of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults with topical fluticasone propionate. The Netherlands Adult Atopic DermatitisStudy Group |journal=[[British Journal of Dermatology]] |volume=140 |issue=6 |pages=1114–21 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10354080}}</ref>

Some recent research claims that topically applied corticosteroids did not significantly increase the risk of skin thinning, stretch marks or HPA axis suppression (and where such suppression did occur, it was mild and reversible where the corticosteroids were used for limited periods of time). Further, skin conditions are often under-treated because of fears of side effects. This has led some researchers to suggest that the usual dosage instructions should be changed from "Use sparingly" to "Apply enough to cover affected areas", and that specific dosage directions using "fingertip units" or FTUs be provided, along with photos to illustrate FTUs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bewley A |title=Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids |journal=The British Journal of Dermatology |volume=158 |issue=5 |pages=917–20 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18294314 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08479.x |last2=Dermatology Working |first2=Group}}</ref> However, caution must always be used as long-term use, prolonged widespread coverage, or use with occlusion, can create side effects that are permanent and resistant to treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Atrophic patches|pmc=1783752| publisher=[[Canadian Family Physician|College of Family Physicians of Canada]] | pmid=17279233|volume=52|issue=12|year=2006|month=December|author=Ting P, Barankin B|journal=Can Fam Physician|pages=1547, 1551–2}}</ref>

====Topical immunosuppressants====
[[File:Protopic.JPG|thumb|Tacrolimus 0.1%]]
Topical [[immunosuppressant]]s like [[pimecrolimus]] (Elidel and Douglan) and [[tacrolimus]] (Protopic) were developed after [[topical corticosteroids]] had come into widespread use. These newer agents effectively suppress the immune system in the affected area, and appear to yield better results in some populations.
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] has issued a public health advisory about the possible risk of lymph node or skin cancer from use of these products,<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=FDA Issues Public Health Advisory Informing Health Care Providers of Safety Concerns Associated with the Use of Two Eczema Drugs, Elidel and Protopic |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2005/ANS01343.html |date=March 10, 2005 |publisher=FDA |accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070917075450/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2005/ANS01343.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-17}}</ref> but many professional medical organizations disagree with the FDA's findings;
*The postulation is that the immune system may help remove some pre-cancerous abnormal cells which is prevented by these drugs. However, any chronic inflammatory condition such as eczema, by the very nature of increased metabolism and cell replication, has a tiny associated risk of cancer (see [[Bowen's disease]]).
*Current practice by UK dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of these new drugs.<ref name="BAD2002">{{cite web |author=N H Cox and Catherine H Smith |title=Advice to dermatologists re topical tacrolimus |url=http://www.bad.org.uk/healthcare/guidelines/Advice_re_topical_tacrolimus.doc |format=DOC |year=2002 |month=December |work=Therapy Guidelines Committee |publisher=British Association of Dermatologists}}</ref> The dramatic improvement on the condition can significantly improve the quality of life of sufferers (and families kept awake by the distress of affected children). The major debate, in the UK, has been about the cost of such newer treatments and, given only finite [[National Health Service|NHS]] resources, when they are most appropriate to use.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Pimecrolimus cream for atopic dermatitis |journal=Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=33–6 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12789846 |doi=10.1136/dtb.2003.41533}}</ref>
*In addition to cancer risk, there are other potential side effects with this class of drugs. Adverse reactions including severe flushing, headaches, flu-like syndrome, photosensitive reactivity and possible drug interactions with a variety of medications, alcohol and grapefruit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astellas.us/docs/protopic.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - package insert and med guide June 2009.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref><ref name="Martins">{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0365-05962004000300002 |title=Tratamento sistêmico da psoríase - Parte I: metotrexato e acitretina |year=2004 |last1=Martins |first1=Gladys Aires |last2=Arruda |first2=Lucia |journal=Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia |volume=79}}</ref>

====Systemic immunosuppressants====
When eczema is severe and does not respond to other forms of treatment, [[immunosuppressant]] drugs are sometimes prescribed. These dampen the immune system and can result in dramatic improvements to the patient's eczema. However, immunosuppressants can cause side effects on the body. As such, patients must undergo regular blood tests and be closely monitored by a doctor. In the UK, the most commonly used immunosuppressants for eczema are [[ciclosporin]], [[azathioprine]] and [[methotrexate]]. These drugs were generally designed for other medical conditions but have been found to be effective against eczema.

====Itch relief====
[[Anti-itch drug]]s, often [[antihistamine]], and dermasil may reduce the itch during a flare up of eczema, and the reduced scratching in turn reduces damage and irritation to the skin (the "[[itch cycle]]").{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} However, in some cases, significant benefit may be due to the sedative side effects of these drugs, rather than their specific antihistamine effect. Thus sedating antihistamines such as promethazine (Phenergan) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be more effective at preventing night time scratching than the newer, nonsedating antihistamines.<ref>http://www.cks.nhs.uk/eczema_atopic/evidence/supporting_evidence/antihistamines | Retrieved 14 November 2011</ref>

[[Capsaicin]] applied to the skin acts as a counter irritant (see [[Pain#Gate control|gate control theory]] of nerve signal transmission).

[[Hydrocortisone]] applied to the skin aids in temporary itch relief.

Temporary yet significant and fast-acting relief can be found by cooling the skin via water (swimming, cool water bath or wet washcloth), air (direct output of an [[air conditioning]] vent), or careful use of an [[ice pack]] (wrapped in soft smooth cloth, e.g., pillow case, to protect skin from damage).

===Moisturizers===
Eczema can be exacerbated by [[dryness (medical)|dryness]] of the skin. Moisturizing is one of the most important self-care treatments for eczema. Keeping the affected area moistened can promote skin healing and relief of symptoms. [[Soap]]s and detergents should not be used on affected skin because they can strip natural skin oils and lead to excessive dryness.

Moistening agents are called [[emollients]]. In general, it is best to match thicker ointments to the driest, flakiest skin. Light emollients may not have any effect on severely dry skin. Moisturizing gloves (gloves which keep emollients in contact with skin on the hands) can be worn while sleeping. Generally, twice-daily applications of emollients work best. [[Ointment]]s, with less water content, stay on the skin longer and need fewer applications, but they can be greasy and inconvenient. Steroids may also be mixed in with ointments.

For unbroken skin, direct application of waterproof tape with or without an emollient or prescription ointment can improve moisture levels and skin integrity which allows the skin to heal. This treatment regimen can also help prevent the skin from cracking, as well as put a stop to the itch cycle. The end result is reduced lichenification (the roughening of skin from repeated scratching). Taping works best on skin away from joints.

There is a disagreement whether baths are desirable or a necessary evil. For example, the [[Mayo Clinic]] advises against daily baths to avoid skin drying.<ref>

the [[American Academy of Dermatology]] claims "it is a common misconception that bathing dries the skin and should be kept to a bare minimum" and recommends bathing to hydrate skin. They even suggest up to 3 short baths a day for people with severe eczema. According to them, a moisturizer should be applied within 3 minutes to trap the moisture from bath in the skin.<ref>

[[Ceramide]]s, which are the major lipid constituent of the [[stratum corneum]], have been used in the treatment of eczema.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coderch L, López O, de la Maza A, Parra JL |title=Ceramides and skin function |journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=107–29 |year=2003 |pmid=12553851 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200304020-00004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bouwstra JA, Ponec M |title=The skin barrier in healthy and diseased state |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=1758 |issue=12 |pages=2080–95 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=16945325 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.06.021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Choi MJ, Maibach HI |title=Role of ceramides in barrier function of healthy and diseased skin |journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=215–23 |year=2005 |pmid=16060709 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200506040-00002}}</ref> They are often one of the ingredients of modern moisturizers.

However, detergents are so ubiquitous in modern environments in items like tissues, and so persistent on surfaces, "safe" soaps are necessary to remove them from the skin in order to control eczema. Although most eczema recommendations use the terms "detergents" and "soaps" interchangeably, and tell eczema sufferers to avoid both, [[detergent]]s and [[soap]]s are not the same and are not equally problematic to eczema sufferers. Detergents, which differ from soap in that they commonly have a sulfate polar group, increase the permeability of skin membranes in a way that soaps and water alone do not. [[Sodium lauryl sulfate]], the most common household detergent, has been shown to amplify the allergenicity of other substances ("increase antigen penetration").<ref name="pmid15898995">{{cite journal |author=Corazza M, Virgili A |title=Allergic contact dermatitis from ophthalmic products: can pre-treatment with sodium lauryl sulfate increase patch test sensitivity? |journal=Contact Dermatitis |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=239–41 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15898995 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-1873.2005.00606.x}}</ref>

Unfortunately there is no one agreed-upon best kind of skin cleanser for eczema sufferers. Different clinical tests, sponsored by different personal product companies, unsurprisingly tout various brands as the most skin-friendly based on specific properties of various products and different underlying assumptions as to what really determines skin friendliness. The terms "hypoallergenic" and "doctor tested" are not regulated<!--This article is UK-specific, I wonder whether the terms are regulated in some jurisdictions-->,<ref name="pmid15115531">{{cite journal |author=Murphy LA, White IR, Rastogi SC |title=Is hypoallergenic a credible term? |journal=Clinical and Experimental Dermatology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=325–7 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15115531 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2230.2004.01521.x}}</ref> and no research has been done showing that products labeled "hypoallergenic" are in fact less problematic than any others. It may be best to avoid soaps and detergent cleansers altogether, except for the armpits, groin and perianal areas, and use cheap bland emollients in the bath or shower.

Various measures may reduce the amount of mite antigens, in particular swapping carpets for hard surfaces.<ref name="pmid11929416">{{cite journal |author=Mihrshahi S, Marks G, Vanlaar C, Tovey E, Peat J |title=Predictors of high house dust mite allergen concentrations in residential homes in Sydney |journal=Allergy |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=137–42 |year=2002 |pmid=11929416| doi = 10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.5720999.x}}</ref> However it is not clear whether such measures actually help with eczema. A controlled study suggested that a number of environmental factors such as air exchange rates, relative humidity and room temperature (but not the level of house dust mites) might have an effect on the condition.<ref name="pmid2564236">{{cite journal |author=Beck HI, Bjerring P, Harving H |title=Atopic dermatitis and the indoor climate. The effect from preventive measures |journal=Acta Dermato-venereologica |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=162–5 |year=1989 |pmid=2564236}}</ref>

===Light therapy===
[[Phototherapy|Light therapy]] (or [[deep penetrating light therapy]]) using [[ultraviolet]] light can help control eczema.<ref name="pmid15752127">{{cite journal |author=Polderman MC, Wintzen M, le Cessie S, Pavel S |title=UVA-1 cold light therapy in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: 61 patients treated in the Leiden University Medical Center |journal=Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=93–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15752127 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0781.2005.00150.x}}</ref> UVA is mostly used, but UVB and Narrow Band UVB are also used. Overexposure to ultraviolet light carries its own risks, particularly potential [[skin cancer]] from exposure.<ref>{{cite news |author=Stöppler MC |title=Psoriasis PUVA Treatment Can Increase Melanoma Risk |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=548 |date=31 May 2007 |publisher=MedicineNet |accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref>

When light therapy alone is found to be ineffective, the treatment is performed with the application (or ingestion) of a substance called [[psoralen]]. This [[PUVA]] (Psoralen + UVA) combination therapy is termed photo-chemotherapy. Psoralens make the skin more sensitive to UV light, thus allowing lower doses of UVA to be used. However, the increased sensitivity to UV light also puts the patient at greater risk for skin cancer.<ref name="pmid11312420">{{cite journal |author=Stern RS |title=The risk of melanoma in association with long-term exposure to PUVA |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=755–61 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11312420 |doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.114576 |last2=Puva Follow Up |first2=Study}}</ref>

===Diet===
Recent studies provide hints that [[food allergy]] may trigger atopic dermatitis. For these people, identifying the allergens could lead to an avoidance diet to help minimize symptoms, although this approach is still in an experimental stage.<ref name="pmid15984300">{{cite journal |author=Kanny G |title=[Atopic dermatitis in children and food allergy: combination or causality?

Dietary elements that have been reported to trigger eczema include [[dairy]] products, [[coffee]] (both caffeinated and decaffeinated), [[soybean]] products, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[wheat]] and [[maize]] (sweet corn), though food allergies may vary from person to person.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
However, in 2009, researchers at [[National Jewish Medical and Research Center]] found that eczema patients were especially prone to [[misdiagnosis]] of [[food allergies]].<ref>{{cite press release |author= |title=Food allergies commonly misdiagnosed, especially among eczema patients |url=http://www.nationaljewish.org/about/mediacenter/pressreleases/2009/food-allergies-commonly-misdiagnosed.aspx |date=16 March 2009 |publisher=[[National Jewish Medical and Research Center]] |accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Atkins D |title=Food allergy: diagnosis and management |journal=Primary Care |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=119–40, vii |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18206721 |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2007.09.003}}</ref> 

===Alternative therapies===
A number of alternative therapies are used for eczema including:
<!-- Please add new items only if you provide some explanation AND source. -->
<!-- Otherwise, it will be removed (moved to the talk page, there is already a long list). -->
*[[Sulfur]] has been used for many years as a topical treatment in the alleviation of eczema, although this could be suppressive. It was fashionable in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. However, there is currently no scientific evidence for the claim that sulfur treatment relieves eczema.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sulfur |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/000328.htm |date=4/1/2002 |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center |accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>
*[[Probiotics]] are live microorganisms taken orally, such as the ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' bacteria found in [[yogurt]]. They are not effective for treating eczema in older populations, but some research points to some strains of beneficial microorganisms having the ability to prevent the triad of allergies, eczema and asthma, although in rare cases some species of probiotic bacteria have a very small risk of infection in those with poor immune system response.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boyle RJ, Bath-Hextall FJ, Leonardi-Bee J, Murrell DF, Tang ML |editor1-last=Boyle |editor1-first=Robert John |title=Probiotics for treating eczema |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD006135 |year=2008 |pmid=18843705 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006135.pub2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Flohr C, Pascoe D, Williams HC |title=Atopic dermatitis and the 'hygiene hypothesis': too clean to be true? |journal=The British Journal of Dermatology |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=202–16 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15727630 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06436.x}}</ref> Exposure to probiotics in infancy may shape the immune system to resist eczema.<ref name="jn.nutrition.org">{{cite journal | doi = 10.3945/jn.109.113761 | title = Guidance for Substantiating the Evidence for Beneficial Effects of Probiotics: Prevention and Management of Allergic Diseases by Probiotics | year = 2010 | last1 = Kalliomaki | first1 = M. | last2 = Antoine | first2 = J.-M. | last3 = Herz | first3 = U. | last4 = Rijkers | first4 = G.

Patients can also wear clothing designed specifically to manage the itching, scratching and peeling associated with eczema.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ricci G, Patrizi A, Bellini F, Medri M |title=Use of textiles in atopic dermatitis: care of atopic dermatitis |journal=Current Problems in Dermatology |volume=33 |issue= |pages=127–43 |year=2006 |pmid=16766885 |doi=10.1159/000093940}}</ref>

===Behavioural approach===
In the 1980s, Swedish [[dermatologist]] Peter Noren developed a behavioural approach to the treatment of long term atopic eczema. This approach has been further developed by dermatologist Richard Staughton and [[psychiatrist]] Christopher Bridgett at the [[Chelsea and Westminster Hospital]] in London.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000057975 |title=Psychodermatology and Atopic Skin Disease in London 1989&ndash;1999 &ndash; Helping Patients to Help Themselves |year=2000 |last1=Bridgett |first1=C. |journal=Dermatology and Psychosomatics / Dermatologie und Psychosomatik |volume=1 |page=183}}</ref><ref name="pmid17147570">{{cite journal |author=Bridgett C |title=Psychocutaneous medicine |journal=Journal of cosmetic dermatology |volume=3 |issue=2 |page=116 |year=2004 |pmid=17147570 |doi=10.1111/j.1473-2130.2004.00047.x}}</ref>
Patients undergo a six-week monitored program involving scratch habit reversal and self-awareness of scratching levels. For long-term eczema sufferers, scratching can become habitual. Sometimes scratching becomes a reflex, resulting in scratching without conscious awareness, rather than from the feeling of itchiness itself. The habit reversal program is done in conjunction with the standard applied emollient/corticosteroid treatments so that the skin can heal. It also reduces future scratching, as well as reduces the likelihood of further flareups. The behavioural approach can give an eczema sufferer some control over the degree of severity of eczema.

==Epidemiology==
Globally eczema affected approximately 230&nbsp;million people as of 2010 (3.5% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990–2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607}}</ref> The lifetime clinician-recorded prevalence of eczema has been seen to peak in infancy, with female predominance of eczema presentations occurring during the reproductive period of 15–49 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Osman M, Hansell AL, Simpson CR, Hollowell J, Helms PJ |title=Gender-specific presentations for asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema in primary care |journal=Primary Care Respiratory Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=28–35 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17297524 |doi=10.3132/pcrj.2007.00006}}</ref> Although little data on the trend of eczema prevalence over time exists prior to the Second World War (1939–45), the prevalence of eczema has been found to have increased substantially in the latter half of the 20th Century, with eczema in school-aged children being found to increase between the late 1940s and 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Taylor B, Wadsworth J, Wadsworth M, Peckham C |title=Changes in the reported prevalence of childhood eczema since the 1939–45 war |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8414 |pages=1255–7 |year=1984 |month=December |pmid=6150286 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(84)92805-8}}</ref> A review of epidemiological data in the UK has also found an inexorable rise in the prevalence of eczema over time.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta R, Sheikh A, Strachan DP, Anderson HR |title=Burden of allergic disease in the UK: secondary analyses of national databases |journal=Clinical and Experimental Allergy |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=520–6 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15080802 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2004.1935.x}}</ref> Further recent increases in the incidence and lifetime prevalence of eczema in England have also been reported, such that an estimated 5,773,700 or about one in every nine people have been diagnosed with the disease by a clinician at some point in their lives.<ref name="Simpson CR, Newton J, Hippisley-Cox J, Sheikh A 2009 108–17">{{cite journal |author=Simpson CR, Newton J, Hippisley-Cox J, Sheikh A |title=Trends in the epidemiology and prescribing of medication for eczema in England |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=108–17 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19297652 |pmc=2746851 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.2009.080211}}</ref>

==Research==
Other than direct treatments of the symptoms, no cure is presently known for most types of dermatitis; even cortisone treatments and immunomodulation may often have only minor effects on what may be a complex problem. Even though the effects of eczema are no longer active the person diagnosed is still subject to relapse. The condition is often related to family history of allergies.

Damage from the [[enzyme|enzymatic]] activity of allergens is usually prevented by the body's own [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitors]], such as, [[LEKTI]], produced from the gene [[SPINK5]]. Mutations in this gene are known to cause [[Netherton's syndrome]], which is a [[congenital]] [[erythroderma]]. These patients nearly always develop atopic disease, including hay fever, food allergy, urticaria and asthma. Such evidence supports the hypothesis that skin damage from allergens may be the cause of eczema, and may provide a venue for further treatment.<ref name="pmid11544479">{{cite journal |author=Walley AJ, Chavanas S, Moffatt MF, ''et al.'' |title=Gene polymorphism in Netherton and common atopic disease |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=175–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11544479 |doi=10.1038/ng728}}</ref>

Another study identified a gene that the researchers believe to be the cause of inherited eczema and some related disorders. The gene produces the protein [[filaggrin]], the lack of which causes dry skin and impaired skin barrier function.<ref name=filaggrin>{{cite journal |author=Palmer CN ''et al.'' |year=2006 |title=Common loss-of-function variants of the epidermal barrier protein filaggrin are a major predisposing factor for atopic dermatitis |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=441–6 |pmid=16550169 |doi=10.1038/ng1767}}</ref>

A recent study indicated that two specific chemicals found in the blood are connected to the itching sensations associated with eczema. The chemicals are [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and [[Substance P]].<ref name="BBC-blood chemicals">{{cite news |author= |title= 'Blood chemicals link' to eczema – Scientists have identified two blood chemicals linked to itchy eczema, offering new treatment possibilities. |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6962450.stm |date= 26 August 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

In a genome-wide study published on Dec 25, 2011 in [[Nature Genetics]], researchers reported discovery of three new genetic variants associated with eczema. They are OVOL1, ACTL9 and IL4-KIF3A.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paternoster ''et al.'' |year=2011 |title=Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies three new risk loci for atopic dermatitis |journal=Nature Genetics |doi=10.1038/ng.1017}}</ref>

Eczema has increased dramatically in [[England]] as a study showed a 42% rise in diagnosis of the condition between 2001 and 2005, by which time it was estimated to affect 5.7 million adults and children. A paper in the [[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]] says Eczema is thought to be a trigger for other [[allergy|allergic conditions]]. [[General Practitioner|GP]] records show over 9 million patients were used by researchers to assess how many people have the skin disorder.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eczema cases rise dramatically
