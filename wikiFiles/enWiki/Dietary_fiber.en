'''Dietary fiber''', '''dietary fibre''', or sometimes '''roughage''' and '''ruffage''' is the indigestible portion of food derived from plants.  There are two main components:

* '''Soluble''' fiber dissolves in water. It is readily fermented in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] into gases and physiologically active byproducts, and can be [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] and/or viscous. Soluble fibers tend to slow the movement of food through the system.
* '''Insoluble''' fiber does not dissolve in water.  It can be metabolically inert and provide bulking or prebiotic, metabolically fermenting in the large intestine.  Bulking fibers absorb water as they move through the [[digestive system]], easing [[defecation]].<ref name=USDA-IOM>{{cite web | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients) (2005), Chapter 7: Dietary, Functional and Total fiber| publisher = US Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Library and National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board| url = http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Energy/339-421.pdf}}</ref> Fermentable insoluble fibers mildly promote stool regularity, although not to the extent that bulking fibers do, but they can be readily fermented in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] into gases and physiologically active byproducts.  Insoluble fibers tend to accelerate the movement of food through the system.

Dietary fibers can act by changing the nature of the contents of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and by changing how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed.<ref name=Eastwood/> Some types of soluble fiber absorb water to become a gelatinous, viscous substance and is [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] by bacteria in the digestive tract.

Chemically, dietary fiber consists of non-[[starch]] [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[arabinoxylan]]s, [[cellulose]], and many other plant components such as [[resistant starch]], resistant [[dextrin]]s, [[inulin]], [[lignin]], [[wax]]es, [[chitin]]s, [[pectin]]s, beta-[[glucans]], and [[oligosaccharide]]s.<ref name=USDA-IOM/> A novel position has been adopted by the [[US Department of Agriculture]] to include ''functional fibers'' as isolated fiber sources that may be included in the diet.<ref name=USDA-IOM/> The term "fiber" is something of a [[misnomer]], since many types of so-called dietary fiber are not actually fibrous.

Food sources of dietary fiber are often divided according to whether they provide (predominantly) soluble or insoluble fiber. Plant foods contain both types of fiber in varying degrees, according to the plant's characteristics.

Advantages of consuming fiber are the production of healthful compounds during the fermentation of soluble fiber, and insoluble fiber's ability (via its passive [[hygroscopic]] properties) to increase bulk, soften stool, and shorten transit time through the [[intestinal tract]].

Disadvantages of a diet high in fiber is the potential for significant intestinal gas production and bloating. [[Constipation]] can occur if insufficient fluid is consumed with a high-fiber diet.

== Definition ==
Originally, fiber was defined to be the components of plants that resist human digestive enzymes, a definition that includes [[lignin]] and [[polysaccharide]]s. The definition was later changed to also include resistant [[starch]]es, along with [[inulin]] and other [[oligosaccharide]]s.<ref name=Anderson/>

Official definition of dietary fiber differs a little among different institutions:

Dietary fiber is found in plants. While all plants contain some fiber, plants with high fiber concentrations are generally the most practical source.

Fiber-rich plants can be eaten directly. Or, alternatively, they can be used to make supplements and fiber-rich processed foods.

The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] (AND), formerly the American Dietetic Association, recommends consuming a variety of fiber-rich foods.

=== Plant sources of fiber ===
[[File:Soybeanvarieties.jpg|thumb|Legumes contain healthy dietary fibers.]]
Some plants contain significant amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber. For example [[plum]]s and [[prune (fruit)|prune]]s have a thick skin covering a juicy pulp.  The skin is a source of insoluble fiber, whereas soluble fiber is in the pulp. Also, grapes have a fair amount of fiber in them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis M, Bowen PE, Hussain EA, Damayanti-Wood BI, Farnsworth NR |title=Chemical composition and potential health effects of prunes: a functional food? |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=251–86 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11401245 |doi=10.1080/20014091091814 }}</ref>

The root of the [[konjac]] plant, or [[glucomannan]], produces results similar to fiber and may also be used to relieve constipation. Glucomannan is sold in various forms, and while safe in some forms, it can be unsafe in others, possibly leading to throat or intestinal blockage.<ref>http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-205-Konjac+GLUCOMANNAN.aspx?activeIngredientId=205&activeIngredientName=Konjac+(GLUCOMANNAN)&source=2</ref>

'''Soluble fiber''' is found in varying quantities in all plant foods, including:
* [[legume]]s ([[pea]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[lupin]]s and other [[bean]]s)
* [[oat]]s, [[rye]], [[Salvia hispanica|chia]], and [[barley]]
* some [[fruit]]s and fruit [[juice]]s (including prune juice, plums, [[berry|berries]], ripe [[bananas]], and the insides of [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s)
* certain [[vegetable]]s such as [[broccoli]], [[carrot]]s, and [[Jerusalem artichoke]]s
* [[root tuber]]s and [[root vegetable]]s such as [[sweet potato]]es and [[onion]]s (skins of these are sources of insoluble fiber also)
* [[psyllium]] seed husk (a [[mucilage]] soluble fiber) and flax seeds
* [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, with [[almonds]] being the highest in dietary fiber

Sources of '''insoluble fiber''' include:
* [[whole grain]] foods
* [[wheat]] and [[Maize|corn]] [[bran]]
* [[legumes]] such as beans and peas
* nuts and [[seed]]s
* [[potato]] skins
* [[lignans]]
* vegetables such as [[green bean]]s, [[cauliflower]], [[zucchini]] (courgette), [[celery]], and [[nopal]]
* some fruits including [[avocado]], and unripe bananas
* the skins of some fruits, including [[kiwifruit]],[[grapes]] and [[tomato]]es<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alvarado A, Pacheco-Delahaye E, Hevia P |title=Value of a tomato byproduct as a source of dietary fiber in rats |journal=Plant Foods Hum Nutr. |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=335–48 |year=2001 |pmid=11678439 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0921-9668&volume=56&page=335 |doi=10.1023/A:1011855316778}}</ref>

===Fiber supplements===
These are a few example forms of fiber that have been sold as supplements or food additives. These may be marketed to consumers for nutritional purposes,  treatment of various [[gastrointestinal]] disorders, and for such possible health benefits as lowering [[cholesterol]] levels, reducing risk of [[colon cancer]], and losing weight.

====Inulins====
{{Main|Inulin}}

Chemically defined as [[oligosaccharide]]s occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as [[carbohydrates]], or more specifically as [[fructan]]s, a [[polymer]] of the natural plant sugar, [[fructose]]. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as [[chicory]] roots or [[Jerusalem artichoke]]s for use in prepared foods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaur N, Gupta AK |title=Applications of inulin and oligofructose in health and nutrition |journal=J Biosci. |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=703–14 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12571376 |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/dec2002/703.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.1007/BF02708379}}</ref> Subtly sweet, it can be used to replace sugar, fat, and flour, is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered [[nutritional supplements]], and has significant potential health value as a [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] fermentable fiber.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roberfroid MB |title=Inulin-type fructans: functional food ingredients |journal=J Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2493S–2502S |pmid=17951492 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17951492 |date= November 1, 2007 }}</ref>

Inulin is advantageous because it contains 25&ndash;30% the [[food energy]] of sugar or other carbohydrates and 10–15% the food energy of fat. As a prebiotic fermentable fiber, its metabolism by [[gut flora]] yields short-chain fatty acids ([[#Short-chain_fatty_acids|see below]]) which increase absorption of [[calcium]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Abrams S, Griffin I, Hawthorne K, Liang L, Gunn S, Darlington G, Ellis K | title = A combination of prebiotic short- and long-chain inulin-type fructans enhances calcium absorption and bone mineralization in young adolescents | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 471–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16087995}}</ref> [[magnesium]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Coudray C, Demigné C, Rayssiguier Y | title = Effects of dietary fibers on magnesium absorption in animals and humans | journal = J Nutr | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12514257}}</ref> and [[iron]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tako E, Glahn RP, Welch RM, Lei X, Yasuda K, Miller DD. | title = Dietary inulin affects the expression of intestinal enterocyte iron transporters, receptors and storage protein and alters the microbiota in the pig intestine | journal = Br J Nutr. | issue = Sep | pages = 1–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17868492 | volume = 99 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114507825128}}</ref> resulting from upregulation of mineral-transporting [[gene]]s  and their [[membrane transport proteins]] within the colon wall. Among other potential beneficial effects noted above, inulin promotes an increase in the mass and health of intestinal ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' and ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'' populations.

====Vegetable gums====

[[Natural gum|Vegetable gum]] fiber supplements are relatively new to the market. Often sold as a powder, vegetable gum fibers dissolve easily with no aftertaste. In preliminary clinical trials, they have proven effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Parisi GC, Zilli M, Miani MP, Carrara M, Bottona E, Verdianelli G, Battaglia G, Desideri S, Faedo A, Marzolino C, Tonon A, Ermani M, Leandro G. | title = High-fiber diet supplementation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): a multicenter, randomized, open trial comparison between wheat bran diet and partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) | journal = Dig Dis Sci. | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 1697–704 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12184518 | doi = 10.1023/A:1016419906546}}</ref> Examples of vegetable gum fibers are [[guar gum]] and [[gum arabic|acacia Senegal gum]].

Not yet formally proposed as an essential macro-nutrient, dietary fiber is nevertheless regarded as important for the diet, with regulatory authorities in many developed countries recommending increases in fiber intake.<ref name=USDA-IOM/><ref name=Eastwood>{{cite journal |author=Eastwood M, Kritchevsky D |title=Dietary fiber: how did we get where we are? |journal=Annu Rev Nutr |volume=25 |issue= |pages=1–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16011456 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.25.121304.131658 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Dietary reference values for carbohydrates and dietary fiber| publisher = European Food Safety Authority | url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/DocumentSet/nda_op_drv_carbohydrates_draft_en_released%20for%20consultation,0.pdf?ssbinary=true}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Appl Physiol Nutr Metab |year=2008 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=118–23 |title=Are functional foods redefining nutritional requirements? |author=Jones PJ, Varady KA |doi=10.1139/H07-134 |pmid=18347661 |url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=1715-5312&volume=33&issue=1&startPage=118 |format=PDF }}</ref>

===Physicochemical properties===
Dietary fiber has distinct [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties. Most semi-solid foods, fiber and fat are a combination of gel matrices which are hydrated or collapsed with microstructural elements, globules, solutions or  encapsulating walls. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cellular materials.<ref>Hermansson AM. Gel structure of food biopolymers In:  Food Structure, its creation and evaluation.JMV Blanshard and JR Mitchell, eds. 1988  pp. 25-40Butterworths, London.</ref><ref>Rockland LB, Stewart GF. Water Activity: Influences on Food Quality. Academic Press, New York. 1991</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Eastwood MA, Morris ER | year = 1992 | title = Physical properties  of  dietary fibre that influence physiological function: a model for polymers along the gastrointestinal tract | url = | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 436–442 }}</ref>

* The cells of cooked potatoes and legumes are gels filled with gelatinized starch granules.  The cellular structures of fruits and vegetables are foams with a closed cell geometry filled with a gel, surrounded by cell walls which are composites with an amorphous matrix strengthened by complex carbohydrate fibers.
* Particle size and interfacial interactions with adjacent matrices affect the mechanical properties of food composites.
* Food  polymers may be soluble in and/or plasticized by water. Water is the most important plasticizer, particularly in biological systems thereby changing mechanical properties.
* The variables include chemical structure, polymer concentration, molecular weight, degree of chain branching, the extent of ionization (for electrolytes), solution pH, ionic  strength and temperature.
* Cross-linking of different polymers, protein and polysaccharides, either through chemical covalent bonds or cross-links through molecular entanglement or hydrogen or ionic bond cross-linking.
* Cooking and chewing food alters these physicochemical properties and hence absorption and movement through the stomach and along the intestine <ref>Eastwood MA. The physiological effect of dietary fiber: an update.Annual Review Nutrition, 1992:12 : 19-35</ref>

===Dietary fiber and the upper gastrointestinal tract===
A slowly eaten meal will enter the absorptive phase of the gastrointestinal tract more slowly than a rapidly eaten meal of similar composition. Many of the differences between low and high glycemic foods would disappear if a meal was eaten slowly.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heaton KW, Marcus SN, Emmett PH, Bolton DH | year = 1988 | title = Particle size of wheat, maize, oat test meals;  effects on plasma glucose and insulin responses and rate of starch digestion in vitro | url = | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 675–82 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Jenkins DJA, Wolever TMS, Leeds AR ''et al.'' | year = 1978 | title = Dietary fibres, fibre analogues and glucose tolerance:  importance of viscosity | url = | journal = Br Med J | volume = 1 | issue = 6124| pages = 1392–94 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.6124.1392 }}</ref>

The chemical and physico-chemical nature (lipid, protein, carbohydrate) of the meal will also influence the gastric emptying of the food multiphase system. Fatty foods and [[hypertonic]] solutions empty slowly.
The movement of food, i.e., [[chyme]], along the gastrointestinal tract is typical of flow in a disperse system. As chyme moves along the gastrointestinal tract, polymer flow and diffusion becomes important.<ref name="Edwards">Edwards CA, Johnson IT, Read NW. Do viscous polysaccharides reduce absorption by inhibiting diffusion or convection? Eur J Clin Nutr 1988;42:307-12.</ref>

Following a meal, the stomach and upper gastrointestinal contents consist of
* food compounds
* complex lipids/[[micelles|micellar]]/[[aqueous]]/[[hydrocolloid]] and [[hydrophobic]] phases
* [[hydrophilic]] phases
* solid, liquid, colloidal and gas bubble phases.<ref name="Eastwood_a">Eastwood MA. The physiological effect of dietary fiber: an update.Annual Review Nutrition. 1992.12:19-35.</ref>
Micelles are colloid-sized clusters of molecules which form in conditions as those above, similar to the critical micelle concentration of detergents.<ref name="Carey">Carey MC, Small DM and Bliss CM. Lipid digestion and Absorption. Annual Review of Physiology. 1983.45:651-677.</ref>  
In the upper gastrointestinal tract, these detergents consist of bile acids and di- and monoacyl [[glycerol]]s which solubilize [[triacylglycerol]]s and cholesterol.<ref name="Carey" />  

Two mechanisms bring nutrients into contact with the epithelium:
# intestinal contractions create turbulence; and
# convection currents direct contents from the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] to the epithelial surface.<ref name="Edwards" />
The  multiple physical phases in the intestinal tract slow the rate of absorption compared to that of the suspension solvent alone.
# Nutrients  diffuse through the thin, relatively unstirred layer of fluid adjacent to the epithelium.
# Immobilizing of nutrients and other chemicals within complex polysaccharide molecules affects their release and subsequent absorption from the small intestine, an effect influential on the [[glycemic index]].<ref name="Edwards" />
# Molecules  begin  to interact as their  concentration increases.  During absorption, water must be absorbed at a rate commensurate with the absorption of solutes. The transport of actively and passively absorbed nutrients across epithelium is affected by the unstirred water layer covering the [[microvillus]] membrane.<ref name="Edwards" />
# The presence of mucus or fiber, e.g., pectin or guar, in the unstirred layer may alter the viscosity and solute diffusion coefficient.<ref name="Eastwood_a" />

Adding viscous polysaccharides to carbohydrate meals can reduce [[post-prandial]] blood glucose concentrations.  Wheat and maize but not oats modify glucose absorption, the rate being dependent upon the particle size. The reduction in absorption rate with guar gum may be due to the increased resistance by viscous solutions to the convective flows created by intestinal contractions.
Dietary fiber interacts with pancreatic and enteric enzymes and their substrates.  Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources.  Fiber may affect [[amylase]] activity and hence the rate of hydrolysis of starch. The  more  viscous  polysaccharides extend the mouth-to-[[cecum]] transit time; guar, [[tragacanth]] and pectin  being  slower  than wheat bran.<ref>Schneeman BO, Gallacher D. Effects of dietary fibre on digestive enzyme activity and bile acids in the small intestine.  Proc Soc Exp Biol Med 1985;  180  409-14.</ref>

===Fiber in the colon===
The colon may be regarded as two organs,
# the right side a fermenter,.<ref>Hellendoorn  EW 1983 Fermentation as the principal cause of the physiological activity of indigestible food residue. In: Spiller GA (ed) ''Topics in dietary fiber research''. Plenum Press, New York, pp 127-168</ref> The right side of the colon is involved in nutrient salvage so that dietary fiber, resistant starch, fat and protein are utilised by bacteria and the end-products absorbed for use by the body
# the left side affecting continence.
The presence of bacteria in the colon produces an ‘organ’ of intense, mainly reductive, metabolic activity, whereas the liver is oxidative.
The substrates utilized by the cecal have either passed along the entire intestine or are biliary excretion products .
The effects of dietary fiber in the colon are on
# bacterial fermentation of some dietary fibers
# thereby an increase in bacterial mass
# an increase in bacterial enzyme activity
# changes in the water-holding capacity of the fiber residue after fermentation
Enlargement of the cecum is a common finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now believed to be normal physiological adjustment. Such an increase may be due to a number of factors, prolonged cecal residence of the fiber, increased bacterial mass, or increased bacterial end-products.
Some non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, oligosaccharides and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain fatty acids (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The cecal fermentation of 40–50&nbsp;g of complex polysaccharides will yield 400–500&nbsp;mmol total short-chain fatty acids, 240–300&nbsp;mmol acetate, and 80–100&nbsp;mmol of both propionate and butyrate. Almost all of these short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect caecal and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, the ability of the fiber residue to sequestrate short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.
The production of short-chain fatty acids has several possible actions on the gut mucosa. All of the short-chain fatty acids are readily absorbed by the colonic mucosa, but only acetic acid reaches the systemic circulation in appreciable amounts. Butyric acid appears to be used as a fuel by the colonic mucosa as the preferred energy source for colonic cells.

===Dietary fiber and cholesterol metabolism===
Dietary fiber may act on each phase of ingestion, digestion, absorption and excretion to affect cholesterol metabolism,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brown L, Rosner B, Willett WW and Sacks FM | year = 1999 | title = Cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary fiber: a meta-analysis | journal = Amer J Clin Nutr | volume = 69 | pages = 30–42 | pmid = 9925120 | issue = 1}}</ref> such as the following:

# Caloric energy of foods through a bulking effect
# Slowing of gastric emptying time
# A glycemic index type of action on absorption
# A slowing of bile acid absorption in the [[ileum]] so bile acids escape through to the [[cecum]]
# Altered or increased bile acid metabolism in the cecum
# Indirectly by absorbed short-chain fatty acids, especially propionic acid, resulting from fiber fermentation affecting the cholesterol metabolism in the liver.
# Binding of bile acids to fiber or bacteria in the cecum with increased  fecal loss from the entero-hepatic circulation.
An important action of some fibers is to reduce the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum and hence the amount and type of bile acid and fats reaching the colon. A reduction in the reabsorption of bile acid from the ileum has several direct effects.
# Bile acids may be trapped within the lumen of the ileum either because of a high luminal viscosity or because of  binding to a dietary fiber.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eastwood MA, Hamilton D | year = 1968 | title = Studies on the adsorption of bile salts to non-absorbed components of diet | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Act | volume = 152 | pages = 159–166}}</ref>
# Lignin in fiber adsorbs bile acids, but the unconjugated form of the bile acids are adsorbed more than the conjugated form. In the ileum where bile acids are primarily absorbed the bile acids are predominantly conjugated.
# The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids may be altered and there is an increased flow of bile acids to the cecum, where they are deconjugated and 7alpha-dehydroxylated.
# These water-soluble form, bile acids e.g., deoxycholic and lithocholic are adsorbed to dietary fiber and an increased fecal loss of sterols, dependent in part on the amount and type of fiber.
# A further factor is an increase in the bacterial mass and activity of the ileum as some fibers e.g., pectin are digested by bacteria. The bacterial mass increases and cecal bacterial activity increases.
# The enteric loss of bile acids results in increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol  which in turn reduces body cholesterol.
The fibers that are most effective in influencing sterol metabolism (e.g. pectin) are fermented in the colon. It is therefore unlikely that the reduction in body cholesterol is due to adsorption to this fermented fiber in the colon.
# There might be alterations in the end-products of bile acid bacterial metabolism or the release of short chain fatty acids which are absorbed from the colon,  return to the liver in the portal vein and modulate either the synthesis of cholesterol or its catabolism to bile acids.
# The prime mechanism whereby fiber influences cholesterol metabolism  is through bacteria binding  bile acids in the colon after the initial deconjugation and dehydroxylation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Gillissen and Eastwood | year = 1995 | title = Taurocholic acid adsorption during non-starch polysaccharide fermentation: an in vitro study | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 74 | pages =  221–227 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19950125 | last2 = Eastwood | first2 = Martin A. | issue = 2}}</ref>
# Fermentable fibers e.g., pectin will by virtue of their providing a medium for bacterial growth increase the bacterial mass in the colon. The sequestrated bile acids are then excreted in feces.
# Other fibers, e.g., [[gum arabic]], act as [[Food additive#Categories|stabilizers]] and cause a significant decrease in serum cholesterol without increasing fecal bile acid excretion.

===Dietary fiber and fecal weight===
Feces consist of  plasticine-like material, made up of water, bacteria, lipids, sterols, mucus and fiber.

# Feces are 75% water; bacteria make a large contribution to the dry weight, the residue being unfermented fiber and excreted compounds.
# Fecal output may vary over a range of  between 20 and 280 g over 24 hours. The amount of feces excreted a day varies for any one individual over a period of time.
# Of  dietary constituents, only dietary fiber increases fecal weight.
Water is distributed in the colon in three ways:
# Free water which can be absorbed from the colon.
# Water that is incorporated into bacterial mass.
# Water that is bound by fiber.
Fecal weight is dictated by:
# the holding of water by the residual dietary fiber after fermentation.
# the bacterial mass.
#There may also be an added osmotic effect of products of bacterial fermentation on fecal mass.
Wheat bran is minimally fermented and binds water and when added to the diet increases fecal weight in a predictable linear manner and decreases intestinal transit time. The particle size of the fiber is all-important, coarse wheat bran being more effective than fine wheat bran. The greater the water-holding capacity of the bran, the greater the effect on fecal weight. For most healthy individuals, an increase in wet fecal weight, depending on the particle size of the bran, is generally of the order of 3–5 g/g fiber.
The fermentation of some fibers results in an increase in the bacterial content and possibly fecal weight. Other fibers, e.g. pectin, are fermented and have no effect on stool weight.

==Effects of fiber intake==
Research has shown that fiber may benefit health in several different ways. Lignin and probably related materials that are resistant to enzymatic degradation, diminish the nutritional value of foods.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.54.031902.134938 | title = Ligninbiosynthesis | year = 2003 | last1 = Boerjan | first1 = Wout | last2 = Ralph | first2 = John | last3 = Baucher | first3 = Marie | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 54 | pages = 519–46 | pmid = 14503002}}</ref>

Fiber does not bind to minerals and vitamins and therefore does not restrict their absorption, but rather evidence exists that fermentable fiber sources improve absorption of minerals, especially calcium.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Greger JL |title=Nondigestible carbohydrates and mineral bioavailability |journal=J Nutr. |volume=129 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=1434S–5S |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10395614 |doi= |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10395614}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Raschka L, Daniel H |title=Mechanisms underlying the effects of inulin-type fructans on calcium absorption in the large intestine of rats |journal=Bone |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=728–35 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16126464 |doi=10.1016/j.bone.2005.05.015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Scholz-Ahrens KE, Schrezenmeir J |title=Inulin and oligofructose and mineral metabolism: the evidence from animal trials |journal=J Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2513S–2523S |year=2007 |month=Nov |pmid=17951495}}</ref> Some plant foods can reduce the absorption of minerals and vitamins like [[calcium]], [[zinc]], [[vitamin C]], and [[magnesium]], but this is caused by the presence of [[phytate]] (which is also thought to have important health benefits), not by fiber.<ref name=OregonState/>

An experiment designed with a large sample and conducted by NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study studied the correlation between fiber intake and colorectal cancer. The analytic cohort consisted of 291 988 men and 197 623 women aged 50–71 y. Diet was assessed with a self-administered food-frequency qustionnaire at baseline in 1995-1996; 2974 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified during 5 y of follow-up.
The result was that total fiber intake was not associated with colorectal cancer. But on the other hand, the analyses of fiber from different food sources showed that fiber from grains was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.<ref>Dietary fiber and whole-grain consumption in relation to colorectal cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, Arthur Schatzkin, Traci Mouw, etc, http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/5/1353.full.pdf+html?sid=daf916fc-14c9-42c6-bd0f-d61335975d9b</ref>

Although many researchers believe that dietary fiber intake reduces risk of colon cancer, one study conducted by researchers at the [[Harvard School of Medicine]] of over 88,000 women did not show a statistically significant relationship between higher fiber consumption and lower rates of colorectal cancer or adenomas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fuchs CS, Giovannucci EL, Colditz GA, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary fiber and the risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma in women |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=340 |issue=3 |pages=169–76 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9895396 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=9895396&promo=ONFLNS19 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199901213400301}}</ref>  Similarly, a 2010 study of 58,279 men found no relationship between dietary fiber and colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simons CCJM et al, |title=Bowel Movement and Constipation Frequencies and the Risk of Colorectal Cancer Among Men in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=172 |issue=12 |pages=1404–14 |year=2010 |month=October |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/10/27/aje.kwq307.full |doi=10.1093/aje/kwq307 |pmid=20980354}}</ref>

==Dietary Fiber and Obesity==

Dietary fiber has many functions in diet, one of which may be to aid in energy intake control and
reduced risk for development of obesity. The role of dietary fiber in energy intake regulation and obesity
development is related to its unique physical and chemical properties that aid in early signals of [[satiety|satiation]] and
enhanced or prolonged signals of [[satiety]]. Early signals of satiation may be induced through cephalic- and
gastric-phase responses related to the bulking effects of dietary fiber on energy density and palatability, whereas
the viscosity-producing effects of certain fibers may enhance satiety through intestinal-phase events related to
modified gastrointestinal function and subsequent delay in fat absorption.

In general, fiber-rich diets, whether
achieved through fiber supplementation or incorporation of
high fiber foods into meals, have a reduced energy density
compared with high fat diets. This is related to fiber’s ability to
add bulk and weight to the diet.

However, the subsequent
effect of fiber on food intake has been more variable because in
some cases, food intake at a test meal was reduced, in other
cases, it was not. Although much of the discrepancy in results
may be ascribed to differences among studies, different responses
related to gender and body weight status (i.e., obese vs.
normal weight) may also be responsible. With regard to gender,
work in our {{which|date=December 2012}} laboratory indicates that women may be more
sensitive to dietary manipulation with fiber than men, which
is consistent with a previous report by Burley et al. (1993).
Moreover, we{{who|date=December 2012}} have found that the subjective satiety response
to dietary manipulation in men and women is supported by
differences in the CCK response, suggesting that signals for
satiety differ between genders (Burton-Freeman et al. 1998
and personal communication). The relationship of body
weight status and fiber effect on energy intake suggests that
obese individuals may be more likely to reduce food intake
(Evans and Miller 1975, Porikos and Hagamen 1986) with
dietary fiber inclusion.

==Guidelines on fiber intake==

Current recommendations from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], [[Institute of Medicine]], suggest that adults should consume 20–35&nbsp;grams of dietary fiber per day, but the average American's daily intake of dietary fiber is only 12–18&nbsp;grams.<ref name="OregonState">[http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/phytochemicals/fiber/ Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/fiber.html fiber: Nutrition Source, Harvard School of Public Health<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The AND ([[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]], previously ADA) recommends a minimum of 20–35 g/day for a healthy adult depending on calorie intake (e.g., a 2000 Cal/8400 kJ diet should include 25 g of fiber per day). The AND's recommendation for children is that intake should equal age in years plus 5 g/day (e.g., a 4 year old should consume 9 g/day). No guidelines have yet been established for the elderly or very ill. Patients with current [[constipation]], [[vomiting]], and [[abdominal pain]] should see a physician. Certain bulking agents are not commonly recommended with the prescription of [[opioid]]s because the slow transit time mixed with larger stools may lead to severe constipation, pain, or obstruction.

The [[British Nutrition Foundation]] has recommended a minimum fiber intake of 18 g/day for healthy adults.<ref>[http://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/nutrients/dietary-fibre Dietary fibre.] British Nutrition Foundation.</ref>

===Fiber recommendations in the USA===
On average, North Americans consume less than 50% of the dietary fiber levels recommended for good health. In the preferred food choices of today's youth, this value may be as low as 20%, a factor considered by experts as contributing to the [[obesity]] levels seen in many [[developed countries]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lustig RH |title=The 'skinny' on childhood obesity: how our western environment starves kids' brains |journal=Pediatr Ann. |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=898–902, 905–7 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17236437 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Suter PM |title=Carbohydrates and dietary fiber |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol. |issue=170 |pages=231–61 |year=2005 |pmid=16596802 |url=http://www.springerlink.comopenurl.asp?genre=chapter&issn=0171-2004&volume=&page=231 |doi=10.1007/3-540-27661-0_8 |volume=170 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=3-540-22569-2}}{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>

The actual fiber intake gaps of different age groups of Americans are shown in the graph from USDA:

Recognizing the growing scientific evidence for physiological benefits of increased fiber intake, regulatory agencies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of the United States have given approvals to food products making health claims for fiber.

In clinical trials to date, these fiber sources were shown to significantly reduce blood cholesterol levels, an important factor for general cardiovascular health,<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.77 Health claims: fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease.] Electronic Code of Federal Regulations: US Government Printing Office, current as of October 20, 2008</ref> and to lower risk of onset for some types of cancer.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.78 Health claims: fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer.] Electronic Code of Federal Regulations:US Government Printing Office, current as of October 20, 2008</ref>

Soluble (fermentable) fiber sources gaining FDA approval are:

* [[Psyllium]] seed husk (7&nbsp;grams per day)
* [[Beta-glucan]] from [[oat bran]], whole [[oat]]s, oatrim, or [[rolled oats]] (3&nbsp;grams per day)
* Beta-glucan from whole grain or dry-milled [[barley]] (3&nbsp;grams per day)

Other examples of fermentable fiber sources (from plant foods or biotechnology) used in functional foods and supplements include [[inulin]], resistant [[dextrin]]s, [[fructans]], [[xanthan gum]], [[cellulose]], [[guar gum]], fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and oligo- or polysaccharides.

Consistent intake of fermentable fiber through foods like berries and other fresh [[fruit]], [[vegetable]]s, [[whole grain]]s, seeds, and nuts is now known to reduce risk of some of the world’s most prevalent diseases<ref name=tungland/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Venn BJ, Mann JI |title=Cereal grains, legumes and diabetes |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr. |volume=58 |issue=11 |pages=1443–61 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15162131 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601995 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee YP, Puddey IB, Hodgson JM |title=Protein, fiber and blood pressure: potential benefit of legumes |journal=Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=473–6 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18307744 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04899.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Theuwissen E, Mensink RP |title=Water-soluble dietary fibers and cardiovascular disease |journal=Physiol Behav. |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=285–92 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18302966 |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.01.001 }}</ref>—[[obesity]], [[diabetes]], high blood [[cholesterol]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and numerous [[gastrointestinal]] disorders.

Insufficient fiber in the diet can complicate [[defecation]].<ref name=WebMDConst>WebMD [http://www.webmd.com/content/article/90/100651.htm Constipation]</ref> Low-fiber feces are dehydrated and hardened, making them difficult to evacuate—defining [[constipation]]<ref name=WebMDConst/> and possibly leading to development of [[hemorrhoid]]s<ref name=WebMDConst/> or [[anal fissure]]s.

===Fibre recommendations in the UK===
In June 2007, the [[British Nutrition Foundation]] issued a statement to define dietary fibre more concisely and list the potential health benefits established to date:<ref>[http://www.nutraingredients.com/news/ng.asp?n=77554&m=1NIE621&c=zondoewvtjilvpr British Nutrition Foundation defines 'fibre'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.nutrition.org.uk/home.asp?siteId=43&sectionId=1495&subSectionId=1479&parentSection=304&which=4#2004 British Nutrition Foundation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

<blockquote>‘Dietary fibre’ has been used as a collective term for a complex mixture of substances with different chemical and physical properties which exert different types of physiological effects.

The use of certain analytical methods to quantify dietary fibre by nature of its indigestibility results in many other indigestible components being isolated along with the [[carbohydrate]] components of dietary fibre. These components include [[resistant starch]]es and [[oligosaccharides]] along with other substances that exist within the plant cell structure and contribute to the material that passes through the [[digestive tract]]. Such components are likely to have physiological effects.

Yet, some differentiation has to be made between these indigestible plant components and other partially digested material, such as [[protein]], that appears in the large [[bowel]]. Thus, it is better to classify fibre as a group of compounds with different physiological characteristics, rather than to be constrained by defining it chemically.

Diets naturally high in fibre can be considered to bring about several main physiological consequences:

* helps prevent constipation
* reduces the risk of colon cancer
* improvements in [[gastrointestinal]] health
* improvements in [[glucose tolerance]] and the [[insulin]] response
* reduction of [[hyperlipidemia]], [[hypertension]], and other [[coronary heart disease]] risk factors
* reduction in the risk of developing some [[cancers]]
* increased [[satiety]] and hence some degree of weight management

Therefore, it is not appropriate to state that fibre has a single all encompassing physiological property as these effects are dependent on the type of fibre in the diet. The beneficial effects of high fibre diets are the summation of the effects of the different types of fibre present in the diet and also other components of such diets.

Defining fibre physiologically allows recognition of indigestible carbohydrates with structures and physiological properties similar to those of naturally occurring dietary fibres.<ref name="autogenerated1" /></blockquote>

==Fiber and calories==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Fiber contributes less energy (measured in Calories or kilojoules) than [[sugar]]s and [[starch]]es because it cannot be fully absorbed by the body.  Sugars and starches provide 4 Calories per gram, and the human body has specific enzymes to break them down into [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[galactose]], which can then be absorbed by the body.  The human body lacks enzymes to break down fiber.  Insoluble fiber does not change inside the body, so the body cannot absorb it and nutritionists say that it contributes 0 Calories per gram.  Soluble fiber is partially fermented, with the degree of fermentability varying with the type of fiber, and contributes some energy when broken down and absorbed by the body.  Dietitians have not reached a consensus on how much energy is actually absorbed, but some approximate around 2 Calories (8.5 kilojoules) per gram of soluble fiber.  Regardless of the type of fiber, the body absorbs fewer than 4 Calories (16.7 kilojoules) per gram of fiber, which can create inconsistencies for actual product nutrition labels. In some countries, fiber is not listed on nutrition labels, and is considered 0 Calories/gram when the food's total Calories are computed. In other countries all fiber must be listed, and is considered 4 Calories per gram when the food's total Calories are computed (because chemically fiber is a type of carbohydrate and other carbohydrates contribute 4 Calories per gram). In the US, soluble fiber must be counted as 4 Calories per gram, but insoluble fiber may be (and usually is) treated as 0 Calories per gram and not mentioned on the label.

==Soluble fiber fermentation==
The [[American Association of Cereal Chemists]] has defined soluble fiber this way:
''"the edible parts of plants or similar carbohydrates resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine."''<ref>http://www.aaccnet.org/DietaryFiber/pdfs/dietfiber.pdf</ref>  In this definition:

;edible parts of plants
:indicates that some parts of a plant we eat—skin, pulp, seeds, stems, leaves, roots—contain fiber. Both insoluble and soluble sources are in those plant components.
;carbohydrates
: complex carbohydrates, such as long-chained sugars also called [[starch]], [[oligosaccharides]], or [[polysaccharides]], are sources of soluble fermentable fiber.
;resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine
:foods providing nutrients are digested by [[gastric acid]] and [[digestive enzymes]] in the stomach and small intestine where the nutrients are released then absorbed through the intestinal wall for transport via the blood throughout the body. A food resistant to this process is undigested, as insoluble and soluble fibers are. They pass to the large intestine only affected by their absorption of water (insoluble fiber) or dissolution in water (soluble fiber).
;complete or partial '''fermentation''' in the large intestine
: the large intestine comprises a segment called the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] within which additional nutrient absorption occurs through the process of fermentation. Fermentation occurs by the action of colonic bacteria on the food mass, producing gases and short-chain fatty acids. It is these short-chain fatty acids—[[butyric acid|butyric]], [[acetic acid|acetic]] (ethanoic), [[propionic acid|propionic]], and [[valeric acid|valeric]] acids—that scientific evidence is revealing to have significant health properties.<ref name=Wong>{{cite journal |author=Wong JM, de Souza R, Kendall CW, Emam A, Jenkins DJ |title=Colonic health: fermentation and short chain fatty acids |journal=J Clin Gastroenterol. |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=235–43 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16633129 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00004836-200603000-00015 |doi=10.1097/00004836-200603000-00015}}</ref>

As an example of fermentation, shorter-chain carbohydrates (a type of fiber found in legumes) cannot be digested, but are changed via fermentation in the colon into short-chain [[fatty acids]] and gases (which are typically expelled as [[flatulence]]).

According to a 2002 journal article,<ref name=tungland>Tungland BC, Meyer D, Nondigestible oligo- and polysaccharides (dietary fiber): their physiology and role in human health and food, Comp Rev Food Sci Food Safety, 3:73-92, 2002 (Table 3)[http://webdev.ift.org/NR/rdonlyres/7F1901F3-743E-4C1A-8A3A-38473B8A1037/0/crfsfsv01n3p073077ms20001598.pdf]</ref>
fibers compounds with partial or low fermentability include:

* [[cellulose]], a [[polysaccharide]]
* [[hemicellulose]], a polysaccharide
* [[lignan]]s, a group of [[phytoestrogen]]s
* plant [[wax]]es
* [[resistant starch]]es

fiber compounds with high fermentability include:

* [[beta-glucans]], a group of polysaccharides
* [[pectin]]s, a group of [[heteropolysaccharide]]s
* [[natural gum]]s, a group of polysaccharides
* [[inulin]]s, a group of polysaccharides
* [[oligosaccharide]]s, a group of short-chained or [[simple sugar]]s
* resistant [[dextrin]]s<ref>{{cite book |author=Institute of Medicine |title=Dietary reference intakes for energy, carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2005 |pages=347 |isbn=0-309-08525-X }}</ref>

==Short-chain fatty acids==

When soluble fiber is fermented, [[Short chain fatty acid|short-chain fatty acid]]s (SCFA) are produced. SCFAs are involved in numerous physiological processes promoting health, including:<ref name=Wong/>

* stabilize blood [[glucose]] levels by acting on pancreatic [[insulin]] release and liver control of [[glycogen]] breakdown
* stimulate [[gene expression]] of [[glucose transporter]]s in the [[intestinal mucosa]], regulating glucose absorption<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drozdowski LA, Dixon WT, McBurney MI, Thomson AB |title=Short-chain fatty acids and total parenteral nutrition affect intestinal gene expression |journal=J Parenter Enteral Nutr. |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=145–50 |year=2002 |pmid=12005453 |url=http://pen.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12005453 |doi=10.1177/0148607102026003145}}</ref>
* provide nourishment of colonocytes, particularly by the SCFA butyrate
* suppress [[cholesterol]] synthesis by the liver and reduce blood levels of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]]s responsible for [[atherosclerosis]]
* lower colonic [[pH]] (i.e., raises the acidity level in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]) which protects the lining from formation of [[colonic polyp]]s and increases absorption of [[dietary mineral]]s
* stimulate production of [[T helper cell]]s, [[Antibody|antibodies]], [[leukocyte]]s, [[cytokine]]s, and [[lymph]] mechanisms having crucial roles in [[immune]] protection
* improve barrier properties of the colonic [[mucosal]] layer, inhibiting [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and [[adhesion]] irritants, contributing to immune functions

SCFAs that are absorbed by the colonic mucosa pass through the colonic wall into the [[portal circulation]] (supplying the [[liver]]), and the liver transports them into the general [[circulatory system]].

Overall, SCFAs affect major regulatory systems, such as blood glucose and lipid levels, the colonic environment, and intestinal immune functions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roy CC, Kien CL, Bouthillier L, Levy E |title=Short-chain fatty acids: ready for prime time? |journal=Nutr Clin Pract. |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=351–66 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16870803 |url=http://ncp.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16870803 |doi=10.1177/0115426506021004351}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Scholz-Ahrens KE, Ade P, Marten B, ''et al.'' |title=Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics affect mineral absorption, bone mineral content, and bone structure |journal=J Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=3 Suppl 2 |pages=838S–46S |pmid=17311984 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17311984 |date= March 1, 2007 }}</ref>

The major SCFAs in humans are [[butyric acid|butyrate]], [[propionic acid|propionate]], and [[acetic acid|acetate]], where butyrate is the major energy source for [[colon (anatomy)|colonocyte]]s, propionate is destined for uptake by the liver, and acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral tissues.

==FDA-approved health claims==

The FDA allows producers of foods containing 1.7g per serving of psyllium husk soluble fiber or 0.75g of [[oat]] or [[barley]] soluble fiber as [[beta-glucans]] to claim that reduced risk of [[heart disease]] can result from their regular consumption.<ref name="FDAc">[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/2lg-xc.html FDA/CFSAN A Food Labeling Guide: Appendix C Health Claims, April 2008]</ref>

The FDA statement template for making this claim is: ''Soluble fiber from foods such as [name of soluble fiber source, and, if desired, name of food product], as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of [name of food product] supplies __ grams of the [necessary daily dietary intake for the benefit] soluble fiber from [name of soluble fiber source] necessary per day to have this effect.''<ref name="FDAc"/>

Eligible sources of soluble fiber providing beta-glucan include:

# Oat bran
# Rolled oats
# Whole oat flour
# Oatrim
# Whole grain barley and dry milled barley
# Soluble fiber from psyllium husk with purity of no less than 95%

The allowed label may state that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain of the above foods "may" or "might" reduce the risk of heart disease.

As discussed in FDA regulation 21 CFR 101.81, the daily dietary intake levels of soluble fiber from sources listed above associated with reduced risk of [[coronary heart disease]] are:

* 3g or more per day of beta-glucan soluble fiber from either whole oats or barley, or a combination of whole oats and barley
*7g or more per day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk.<ref>Soluble Fiber from Certain Foods and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease, U.S. Government Printing Office, Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21: Food and Drugs, part 101: Food Labeling, Subpart E, Specific Requirements for Health Claims, 101.81 [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=77ed7da9463357d9a09892213e5c74db&rgn=div8&view=text&node=21:2.0.1.1.2.5.1.12&idno=21]</ref>

Soluble fiber from consuming grains is included in other allowed health claims for lowering risk of some types of cancer and heart disease by consuming fruit and vegetables (21 CFR 101.76, 101.77, and 101.78).<ref name="FDAc"/>

==Potential longevity==
A study of 388,000 adults ages 50 to 71 for nine years found that the highest consumers of fiber were 22% less likely to die over this period.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = Arch Intern Med | date = Feb 14, 2011 | author = Park Y, Subar AF, Hollenbeck A, Schatzkin A | title = Dietary fiber intake and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study | pmid = 21321288 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.18| volume = 171| issue = 12| pages = 1061–8}}</ref> In addition to lower risk of death from heart disease, adequate consumption of fiber-containing foods, especially grains, was also associated with reduced incidence of infectious and respiratory illnesses, and, particularly among males, reduced risk of [[cancer]]-related death.
