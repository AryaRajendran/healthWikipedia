'''Thyroid hormone resistance''' (sometimes '''Refetoff syndrome''') describes a rare [[syndrome]] where the [[thyroid hormone]] levels are elevated but the [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) level is not suppressed, or not completely suppressed as would be expected. The first report of the condition appeared in 1967.<ref name="pmid4163616"/>

==Causes==
The most common cause of the syndrome are [[mutation]]s of the β (beta) form (''[[THRB]]'' gene) of the [[thyroid hormone receptor]], of which over 100 different mutations have been documented.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Mutations in ''[[MCT8]]'' and ''[[SECISBP2]]'' have also been associated with this condition.<ref name="pmid17574009">{{cite journal |author=Refetoff S, Dumitrescu AM |title=Syndromes of reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone: genetic defects in hormone receptors, cell transporters and deiodination |journal=Best Pract.

==Incidence==
Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is rare, incidence is variously quoted as 1 in 50,000 or 1 in 40,000 live births.<ref name="pmid14517508">{{cite journal |author=LaFranchi SH et al |title=Follow-up of newborns with elevated screening T4 concentrations |journal=Pediatr. |volume=143 |page=296-301 |year=2003 |pmid=14517508 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347603001847}}</ref>

==Presentation==
The syndrome can present with variable [[symptom]]s, even between members of the same family harboring the same mutation.<ref name="pmid4163616">{{cite journal |author=Refetoff S, DeWind LT, DeGroot LJ |title=Familial syndrome combining deaf-mutism, stuppled epiphyses, goiter and abnormally high PBI: possible target organ refractoriness to thyroid hormone |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=279–94 |year=1967 |pmid=4163616 |doi=10.1210/jcem-27-2-279}}</ref> Typically most or all tissues are resistant to thyroid hormone, so despite raised measures of serum thyroid hormone the individual may appear [[euthyroid]] (have no symptoms of over- or underactivity of the [[thyroid gland]]). The most common symptoms are [[goiter]] and [[tachycardia]]. It has also been linked to some cases of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), although the majority of people with that diagnosis have no thyroid problems.<ref name="pmid8450877">{{cite journal |author=Hauser P, Zametkin AJ, Martinez P, ''et al.'' |title=Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder in people with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=328 |issue=14 |pages=997–1001 |year=1993 |pmid=8450877 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199304083281403}}</ref>

An association with [[Depression (mood)|depression]] has been proposed.<ref name="pmid17906375">{{cite journal |author=Fardella CE, Artigas RA, Gloger S, ''et al.'' |title=Refractory depression in a patient with peripheral resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and the effect of triiodothyronine treatment |journal=Endocrine |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=272–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17906375 |doi=10.1007/s12020-007-0042-7|url=http://www.humanapress.com/ArticleDetail.pasp?issn=0969-711X&acode=ENDO:31:3:272}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The characteristic [[blood test]] results for this disorder can also be found in other disorders (for example TSH-oma ([[pituitary adenoma]]), or other [[pituitary]] disorders). The diagnosis may involve identifying a mutation of the thyroid receptor, which is present in approximately 85% of cases.<ref name="pmid17534237">{{cite journal |author=Bottcher Y, Paufler T, Stehr T, Bertschat FL, Paschke R, Koch CA |title=Thyroid hormone resistance without mutations in thyroid hormone receptor beta |journal=Med. Sci. Monit. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=CS67–70 |year=2007 |pmid=17534237 |doi=}}</ref>

Yet, since discovery of resistance to thyroid hormones in the absence of thyroid hormone receptor beta mutations, lack of a mutation in a patient does not rule out resistance.<ref name="pmid17383828">{{cite journal |author=Tjørve E, Tjørve KM, Olsen JO, Senum R, Oftebro H |title=On commonness and rarity of thyroid hormone resistance: a discussion based on mechanisms of reduced sensitivity in peripheral tissues |journal=[[Med.
