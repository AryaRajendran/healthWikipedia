The '''basement membrane''' is a thin sheet of [[fiber]]s that underlies the [[epithelium]], which lines the cavities and surfaces of organs including skin, or the [[endothelium]], which lines the interior surface of blood vessels.

== Composition ==
The basement membrane is the fusion of two lamina, the [[basal lamina]] and the [[reticular lamina]] (or lamina reticularis).  The lamina reticularis is attached to the basal lamina with [[anchoring fibrils]] (type VII collagen fibers) and [[microfibril]]s (fibrillin).  The two layers are collectively known as the basement membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paulsson M |title=Basement membrane proteins: structure, assembly, and cellular interactions |journal=Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. |volume=27 |issue=1-2 |pages=93–127 |year=1992 |pmid=1309319 |doi=10.3109/10409239209082560 |url=http://www.crbmb.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/1/93}}</ref>

The basal lamina layer can further be divided into two layers.  The clear layer closer to the epithelium is called the [[lamina lucida]], while the dense layer closer to the connective tissue is called the [[lamina densa]]. The [[Electron microscope|electron-dense]] [[lamina densa]] membrane is about 30–70 [[nanometer]]s in thickness, and consists of an underlying network of reticular [[collagen]] (type IV) fibrils which average 30 nanometers in diameter and 0.1–2 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s in thickness. In addition to collagen, this supportive matrix contains intrinsic macromolecular components. 

The Lamina Densa (which is made up of type IV collagen fibers; perlecan (a heparan sulfate proteoglycan)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Noonan DM, Fulle A, Valente P, ''et al.'' |title=The complete sequence of perlecan, a basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, reveals extensive similarity with laminin A chain, low density lipoprotein-receptor, and the neural cell adhesion molecule |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=266 |issue=34 |pages=22939–47 |year=1991 |month=December |pmid=1744087 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1744087}}</ref> coats these fibers and they are high in [[heparan sulfate]]) and the Lamina Lucida (made up of [[laminin]], [[integrin]]s, [[entactin]]s, and [[dystroglycan]]s) together make up the [[basal lamina]].

Integrins are not part of the basal lamina, they are part of desmosomes which are in the basement membrane but not the basal lamina.
To represent the above in a visually organised manner, the basement membrane is organized as follows:

*Epithelial Tissue (outer)
----
*Basement Membrane
**Basal Lamina
***Lamina Lucida
****laminin
****integrins
****entactins
****dystroglycans
***Lamina Densa
****Type IV collagen (coated with perlecan, rich in heparan sulfate)
**Attaching proteins (between Basal and Reticular Laminae)
*** Type VII collagen (anchoring fibrils)
*** fibrillin (microfibrils)
**Lamina Reticularis
*** Type III collagen
----
*Connective Tissue (inner)

==Function and importance==
The primary function of the basement membrane is to anchor down the [[epithelium]] to its loose [[connective tissue]] (the [[dermis]]) underneath. This is achieved by cell-[[extracellular matrix|matrix]] adhesions through [[substrate adhesion molecules]] (SAMs). 

The basement membrane acts as a mechanical barrier, preventing [[malignant]] cells from invading the deeper tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liotta LA, Tryggvason K, Garbisa S, Hart I, Foltz CM, Shafie S |title=Metastatic potential correlates with enzymatic degradation of basement membrane collagen |journal=Nature |volume=284 |issue=5751 |pages=67–8 |year=1980 |month=March |pmid=6243750 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v284/n5751/abs/284067a0.html |doi=10.1038/284067a0}}</ref> Early stages of malignancy that are thus limited to the epithelial layer by the basement membrane are called [[carcinoma in situ]]. 

The basement membrane is also essential for [[angiogenesis]] (development of new blood vessels). Basement membrane proteins have been found to accelerate [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] of [[endothelial]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kubota Y, Kleinman HK, Martin GR, Lawley TJ |title=Role of laminin and basement membrane in the morphological differentiation of human endothelial cells into capillary-like structures |journal=J. Cell Biol. |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=1589–98 |year=1988 |month=October |pmid=3049626 |pmc=2115245 |url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3049626 |doi=10.1083/jcb.107.4.1589}}</ref>

The most notable examples of basement membranes is in the [[glomerular filtration]] of the [[kidney]], by the fusion of the basal lamina from the [[endothelium]] of glomerular capillaries and the basal lamina of the epithelium of the [[Bowman's capsule]], and between [[lung]] [[alveoli]] and pulmonary [[capillaries]], by the fusion of the basal lamina of the lung alveoli and of the basal lamina of the lung capillaries, which is where oxygen and {{CO2}} diffusion happens.

==Diseases==

Some diseases result from a poorly functioning basement membrane. The cause can be genetic defects, injuries by the body's own immune system, or other mechanisms.<ref>{{cite news |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |title=What’s Wrong With Summer Stiers? |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 22, 2009 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/magazine/22Diseases-t.html}}</ref> 

Genetic defects in the collagen fibers of the basement membrane cause [[Alport syndrome]]. 

Non-collagenous domain basement membrane collagen type IV is autoantigen (target antigen) of autoantibodies in the autoimmune disease [[Goodpasture's syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Janeway |first2=Charles A. |last2=Janeway |title=Immunobiology |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JatpAAAAMAAJ |year=2001 |publisher=Garland |isbn=978-0-8153-3642-6 |edition=5th}}</ref>

A group of diseases stemming from improper function of basement membrane zone are united under the name [[epidermolysis bullosa]].
