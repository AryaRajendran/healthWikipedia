The term '''cryosupernatant''' (also called cryo-poor plasma, cryoprecipitate depleted) refers to [[Blood plasma|plasma]] from which the [[cryoprecipitate]] has been removed.

==Components==
The resulting plasma has reduced levels of [[Factor VIII]] (FVIII), [[von Willebrand factor]] (VWF), [[Factor XIII]] (FXIII), [[fibronectin]] and [[fibrinogen]].  While the levels of FVIII are greatly reduced, levels of fibrinogen can be as much as 70% of original levels.

==Uses==
Cryosupernatant plasma can be used when replacement of FVIII is not required,<ref>{{cite journal
