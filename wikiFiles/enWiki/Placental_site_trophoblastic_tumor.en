Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor is a monophasic neoplasm of the implantation site intermediate trophoblast, and usually a benign lesion, which comprises less than 2% of all gestational trophoblastic proliferations. Preceding conditions include molar pregnancy(5%). Compared to choriocarcinoma or invasive mole, hemorrhage is less conspicuous and serum β-HCG level is low, making early diagnosis difficult. 

Immunohistochemistry: Often stains with hPL, keratin, Mel-CAM, EGFR.

Prognosis : 10~20% of cases metastase leading to death. 

Treatment : Because chemotherapy is ineffective; the patient should undergo hysterectomy.
