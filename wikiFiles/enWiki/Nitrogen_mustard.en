The '''nitrogen mustards''' are [[cytotoxic]] [[chemotherapy]] agents similar to [[mustard gas]]. Although their common use is medicinal, in principle these compounds can also be deployed as [[chemical warfare]] agents.  Nitrogen mustards are nonspecific DNA [[alkylating agents]]. Nitrogen [[mustard gas]] was stockpiled by several nations during the [[Second World War]], but it was never used in combat. As with all types of mustard gas, nitrogen mustards are powerful and persistent [[blister agent]]s and the main examples (HN1, HN2, HN3, see below) are therefore classified as [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1 substances]] within the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. Production and use is therefore strongly restricted. 

During WWII nitrogen mustards were studied at Yale University and classified human clinical trials of nitrogen mustards for the treatment of [[lymphoma]] started in December 1942.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilman A |title=The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard |journal=Am. J.

Due to its use in previous studies, the nitrogen mustard known as "HN2" became the first [[chemotherapy]] drug [[mustine]].

==Examples==
The original nitrogen mustard drug, [[mustine|mustine (HN2)]], is no longer commonly in use. Other nitrogen mustards developed as treatments include [[cyclophosphamide]], [[chlorambucil]], [[uramustine]], [[ifosfamide]], [[melphalan]], and [[bendamustine]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/nar/14.7.2971}}</ref> Bendamustine has recently reemerged as a viable chemotheraputic treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cheson BD, Rummel MJ |title=Bendamustine: rebirth of an old drug |journal=J.

Nitrogen mustards that can be used for chemical warfare purposes are tightly regulated. Their weapon designations are:
* HN1: [[Bis(2-chloroethyl)ethylamine]]
* HN2: [[Bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine]]
* HN3: [[Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine]]

==Mechanism of action==
Nitrogen mustards (NMs) form cyclic aminium ions ([[aziridine|aziridinium]] rings) by intramolecular displacement of the chloride by the amine nitrogen. This azidirium group then alkylates DNA by attacking the N-7 nucleophilic center on the guanine base. A second attack after the displacement of the second chlorine forms the second alkylation step that results in the formation of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) as it was shown in the early 1960s. At that time it was proposed that the ICLs were formed between N-7 atom of guanine residue in a 5’-d(GC) sequence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Geiduschek EP |title="Reversible" DNA |journal=Proc.

Later it was clearly demonstrated that NMs form a 1,3 ICL in the 5’-d(GNC) sequence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rink SM, Solomon MS, Taylor MJ, Rajur SB, McLaughlin LW, Hopkins PB |title=Covalent structure of a nitrogen mustard-induced DNA interstrand cross-link: An N7-to-N7 linkage of deoxyguanosine residues at the duplex sequence 5'-d(GNC) |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=115 |pages=2551–7 |year=1993 |doi=10.1021/ja00060a001 |issue=7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dong Q, Barsky D, Colvin ME, ''et al.'' |title=A structural basis for a phosphoramide mustard-induced DNA interstrand cross-link at 5'-d(GAC) |journal=Proc.

The strong cytotoxic effect caused by the formation of ICLs is what makes NMs an effective chemotherapeutic agent. Other compounds used in cancer chemotherapy that have the ability to form ICLs are [[cisplatin]], [[mitomycin C]], [[carmustine]], and [[psoralen]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s00018-010-0492-6}}</ref>
