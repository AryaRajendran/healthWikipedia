In [[oncology]], '''metastasectomy''' is the [[surgery|surgical]] removal of [[metastases]], which are secondary [[cancer]]ous [[tumor|growth]]s that have spread from cancer originating in another organ in the body.

In many cases, metastases are not treated surgically.  There are two common reasons for this.  Often, even with a successful surgery the patient would have a poor [[prognosis]]. If the cancer is widely disseminated, it is likely that after surgical removal of all known metastases, new ones would occur elsewhere. Sometimes, surgery itself would have a low likelihood of success due to the location and/or extensiveness of the cancer. If complete surgical excision is feasible, however, removing both the primary cancer and its metastases may substantially improve the patient's prognosis.  Some patients may even be in effect cured.<ref name="cured">{{cite journal |author=Tomlinson JS |title=Actual 10-year survival after resection of colorectal liver metastases defines cure |journal=J.

The use of metastasectomy evolved in the field of [[hepatectomy|liver resection]] for metastasised [[colorectal cancer]], but has evolved to include resection of metastases from different primary cancers (such as [[breast cancer]], [[melanoma]], [[renal cell carcinoma]], etc.) to the [[lungs]], [[brain]], and other organs. Not all of these applications are equally [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]], although with respect to some other primary cancers metastasectomy may be underutilized.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

==Liver metastasectomy==
===Colorectal cancer===
Among colorectal cancer patients, 15-25% will have liver metastases already when the colorectal cancer is discovered, and another 25-50% will develop them in the three years after resection of their primary cancer.<ref name="limit?"/>  Of patients who die from metastasised colorectal cancer, 20% have metastasis in the liver alone.<ref name="limit?"/>

For patients in whom the primary tumour is controlled and metastases are limited to the lung, criteria for eligibility include the technical resectability of the metastases and the general fitness and lung function reserve of the patient. If there are both liver and lung metastases, a resection of both can be attempted. In general, only 10% of patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer are resectable.<ref name="limit?"/>
