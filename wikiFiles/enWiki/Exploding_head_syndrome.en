'''Exploding head syndrome''' is a form of [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] [[auditory hallucination]] in which the sufferer sometimes experiences a sudden loud noise coming from within their own [[Human head|head]]. The noise is brief and is usually likened to an [[explosion]], roar, gunshot, door slamming, loud voices or screams, a ringing noise, or the sound of electrical arcing (buzzing).

This noise usually happens at the onset of [[sleep]] or within an hour or two of falling asleep, but is not necessarily the result of a [[dream]].<ref name="Pearce89Clinical">{{Cite journal |title=Clinical features of the exploding head syndrome |journal=Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry |author=Pearce JM |year=1989 |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=907–910 |pmid=2769286 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.52.7.907 |pmc=1031943 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Attacks appear to change in number over time, with several attacks happening in a space of days or weeks, followed by months of remission. Sufferers often feel a sense of [[fear]] and [[anxiety]] after an attack, accompanied by elevated [[heart rate]]. Attacks may also be accompanied by perceived [[Closed-eye hallucination#Levels of CEV perception|flashes of light]] (when perceived on their own, known as a "visual sleep start") or difficulty in breathing. The condition is also known as "auditory sleep starts". The associated symptoms are varied, but the benign nature of the condition is emphasized and neither extensive investigation nor treatment are indicated.<ref name="Pearce89Clinical"/> Sufferers may experience an inability to vocalize any sound, or mild forms of [[sleep paralysis]] during an attack. There is no known treatment.<ref name="PMID 1896728"/>

==Causes==
The cause of the exploding head syndrome (EHS) is not known, though some physicians have reported a correlation with [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]. This condition has also been linked to rapid withdrawal from certain prescription drugs such as [[benzodiazepine]]s and [[SSRI]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ashton|first=Heather|title=BENZODIAZEPINES: HOW THEY WORK|url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha03.htm|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>  The condition may develop at any time during life and women suffer from it slightly more often than men. It is more common over the age of fifty, although it has been reported as young as age 10. Attacks can be one-time events, or can recur with attacks increasing or decreasing over time, sometimes with no incidents over long periods of time.<ref name=asa>{{cite web | title=Exploding Head Syndrome | month=September | year=2007 | publisher=American Sleep Association |url=http://www.sleepassociation.org/index.php?p=explodingheadsyndrome |accessdate=2011-03-18 }}</ref>

The mechanism is also not known, though possibilities have been suggested; one is that it may be the result of a sudden movement of a [[middle ear]] component or of the [[eustachian tube]], another is that it may be the result of a form of minor [[seizure]] in the [[temporal lobe]] where the [[nerve]] cells for hearing are located.<ref name=asa/> [[Electroencephalogram]]s recorded during actual attacks show unusual activity only in some sufferers, and have ruled out [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] as a cause.<ref name="PMID 1896728">{{Cite journal |journal=Sleep |year=1991 |month=June |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=263–266 |title=The exploding head syndrome: polysomnographic recordings and therapeutic suggestions |author=Sachs C, Svanborg E |pmid=1896728 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Related phenomena==
These loud noises are a common feature of [[out-of-body experience]]s.  In surveys, as many as 85% of respondents indicate perception of them during the onset of such experiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astralinfo.org/obesurvey.htm |accessdate=2011-03-18 |title=Results of OBE Survey |last=Buhlman |first=William |work=The Out of Body Experience }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The out-of-body experience: a phenomenological typology based on questionnaire responses | author=Twemlow SW, Gabbard GO, Jones FC |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |year=1982 | first=April |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages=450–455 |pmid=7039367 }}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The exploding head syndrome was first described in 1920 by the Welsh physician and psychiatrist [[Robert Armstrong-Jones]]. He characterized this condition as an exploding sensation in the head. Patients were awakened from their sleep by this event and the sensation persisted for several seconds.<ref name=lancet196_5066_720>{{cite journal |author=Armstrong-Jones R |title=Snapping of the brain |journal=The Lancet |volume=196 |issue=5066 |page=720 | date=October 2, 1920 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)19948-4 }}</ref> A detailed description of the syndrome was given by British neurologist John M. S.

Exploding head syndrome is a condition that causes the sufferer to occasionally experience a tremendously loud noise as originating from within his or her own head, usually described as the sound of an explosion, gunshot, door slamming, roar, waves crashing against rocks, loud voices, a ringing noise, the terrific bang on a tin tray, or the sound of an electrical arcing (buzzing). In some cases an instant flash of what is perceived as video "static" is reported both audibly and visually for a fraction of a second.

This syndrome can also cause the sufferer to feel an extreme rush or adrenaline kick going through his or her head, sometimes multiple times. In most cases, it occurs when they are in a state between asleep and awake. Some sufferers report familiarization with the subsequent fear or panic element such that they no longer consciously experience it.

In some cases repeated attacks lead to the sufferer gaining a fear of sleeping or resting, as this is the most common time for attacks to take place, and this can lead to the development of sleeping disorders such as insomnia.

In some cases it is isolated on the left side of the head, and seems to come from the inner ear region.

A few less common side effects include but are not limited to the following: Increased heavy breathing, loss of appetite and increased laughter.
