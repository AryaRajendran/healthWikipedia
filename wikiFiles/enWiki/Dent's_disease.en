'''Dent's disease''' (or '''Dent disease''') is a rare [[X-linked recessive]] inherited condition that affects the [[proximal renal tubule]]s<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/10123068|Dent disease}}</ref> of the [[kidney]].  It is one cause of [[Fanconi syndrome]], and is characterized by [[tubular proteinuria]], [[hypercalciuria]], [[calcium nephrolithiasis]], [[nephrocalcinosis]] and [[chronic renal failure]].  

"Dent's disease" is often used to describe an entire group of familial disorders, including X-linked recessive [[nephrolithiasis]] with renal failure, X-linked recessive hypophosphataemic rickets, and both Japanese and idiopathic low-molecular-weight proteinuria.<ref>Mayo Clinic, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, [http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/nephrology/renal_stone_disease.cfm Mineral Metabolism and Stone Disease]</ref>  About 60% of patients have mutations in the ''[[CLCN5]]'' gene (Dent 1), which encodes a kidney-specific chloride/proton antiporter, and 15% of patients have mutations in the ''[[OCRL]]1'' gene (Dent 2)<ref>S. Karger AG, Basel, [http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=224793 Truncating Mutations in the Chloride/Proton ClC-5 Antiporter Gene in Seven Jewish Israeli Families with Dent’s 1 Disease]</ref>

== History ==
Dent's disease was first described by [[Charles Enrique Dent]] and M. Friedman in 1964, when they reported two unrelated British boys with [[rickets]] associated with renal tubular damage characterized by [[hypercalciuria]], [[hyperphosphaturia]], [[proteinuria]], and [[aminoaciduria]].<ref>Dent CE, Friedman M. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=14169453&dopt=Abstract Hypercalciuric rickets associated with renal tubular damage]</ref> This set of symptoms was not given a name until 30 years later, when the nephrologist [[Oliver Wrong]] more fully described the disease.<ref name="QJM"/>
Wrong had studied with Dent and chose to name the disease after his mentor.<ref>[http://www.renal.org/whatwedo/news/12-03-06/Professor_Oliver_Wrong_1924_-_2012.aspx Professor Oliver Wrong (1924 - 2012)]</ref> Dent's disease is a genetic disorder caused by the [[genetic mutations]] in the renal [[chloride channel]] ''[[CLCN5]]'', which encodes a kidney-specific, voltage-gated [[chloride channel]] and a 746-amino-acid protein (CLC-5), with 12 to 13 transmembrane domains; it manifests itself through low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, aminoaciduria and hypophosphataemia. Because of its rather rare occurrence, Dent's disease is often diagnosed as [[idiopathic]] [[hypercalciuria]], i.e., excess calcium in urine with undetermined causes.

[[Image:XlinkRecessive.jpg|thumb|X-linked recessive inheritance]]

===Dent disease 1===
Dent's disease is a X-linked recessive disorder. The males are prone to manifesting symptoms in early adulthood with symptoms of calculi, rickets or even with renal failure in more severe cases.

In humans, gene ''CLCN5'' is located on chromosome Xp11.22, and has a 2238-bp coding sequence that consists of 11 exons that span 25 to 30 kb of genomic DNA and encode a 746-amino-acid protein.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/geno.1995.9960 |author=Fisher SE, van Bakel I, Lloyd SE, Pearce SH, Thakker RV, Craig IW |title=Cloning and characterization of CLCN5, the human kidney chloride channel gene implicated in Dent disease (an X-linked hereditary nephrolithiasis) |journal=Genomics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=598–606 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=8575751 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0888754385799600}}</ref>  ''CLCN5'' belongs to the family of voltage-gated chloride channel genes (''CLCN1-CLCN7'', ''CLCKa'' and ''CLCKb'') that have about 12 transmembrane domains. These chloride channels have an important role in the control of membrane excitability, transepithelial transport, and possibly cell volume.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s004240050847 |author=Jentsch TJ, Friedrich T, Schriever A, Yamada H |title=The CLC chloride channel family |journal=Pflugers Arch. |volume=437 |issue=6 |pages=783–95 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10370055 |url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00424/bibs/9437006/94370783.htm}}</ref>

The mechanisms by which CLC-5 dysfunction results in hypercalciuria and the other features of Dent's disease remain to be elucidated. The identification of additional ''CLCN5'' mutations may help in these studies<!--, and we have pursued such studies in patients with Dent's disease-->.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yamamoto K, Cox JP, Friedrich T, ''et al.'' |title=Characterization of renal chloride channel (CLCN5) mutations in Dent's disease |journal=J.

===Dent disease 2===
Dent disease 2 (nephrolithiasis type 2) is associated with the ''[[OCRL]]'' gene.<ref>{{OMIM|300555}}</ref><ref name="pmid15627218">{{cite journal |author=Hoopes RR, Shrimpton AE, Knohl SJ, ''et al.'' |title=Dent Disease with mutations in OCRL1 |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=260–7 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15627218 |pmc=1196371 |doi=10.1086/427887 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9297(07)62577-4}}</ref>  Both Lowe syndrome ([[oculocerebrorenal syndrome]]) and Dent disease can be caused by truncating or missense mutations in ''OCRL''.

== Symptoms ==

Dent's disease often produces symptoms of:

* Extreme thirst combined with [[dehydration]], which leads to frequent urination
* [[Nephrolithiasis]] (kidney stones)
* [[Hypercalciuria]] (high urine calcium - >300&nbsp;mg/d or >4&nbsp;mg/kg per d) with normal levels blood/serum calcium)

Dent's disease may also be associated with:
* [[Aminoaciduria]] ([[amino acids]] in urine)
* [[Phosphaturia]] (phosphate in urine)
* [[Glycosuria]] (glucose in urine)
* [[Kaliuresis]] (potassium in urine)
* [[Hyperuricosuria]] (excessive amounts of uric acid in the urine)
* Impaired urinary acidification
* [[Rickets]]

== Treatment ==

As of today, there is no agreed-upon treatment of Dent's disease and no therapy has been formally accepted. Most treatment measures are mostly supportive in nature; they include:

* [[Thiazide]] [[diuretics]] (i.e. [[hydrochlorothiazide]]) have been used with success in reducing the calcium output in urine, but they are also known to cause [[hypokalemia]].
** In rats with [[diabetes insipidus]], thiazide diuretics inhibit the NaCl cotransporter in the renal distal convoluted tubule, leading indirectly to less water and solutes being delivered to the distal tubule.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loffing J |title=Paradoxical antidiuretic effect of thiazides in diabetes insipidus: another piece in the puzzle |journal=J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=2948–50 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15504949 |doi=10.1097/01.ASN.0000146568.82353.04 |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/content/full/15/11/2948}}</ref>  The impairment of Na transport in the distal convoluted tubule induces [[natriuresis]] and water loss, while increasing the reabsorption of calcium in this segment in a manner unrelated to sodium transport.

* [[Amiloride]] also increases distal tubular calcium reabsorption and has been used as a therapy for idiopathic hypercalciuria.
** A combination of 25&nbsp;mg of chlorthalidone plus 5&nbsp;mg of amiloride daily led to a substantial reduction in urine calcium in Dent's patients, but urine pH was "significantly higher in patients with Dent’s disease than in those with idiopathic hypercalciuria (P < 0.03), and supersaturation for uric acid was consequently lower (P < 0.03)."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.ASN.0000036869.82685.F6 |author=Raja KA, Schurman S, D'mello RG, ''et al.'' |title=Responsiveness of hypercalciuria to thiazide in Dent's disease |journal=J.

* For patients with [[osteomalacia]], [[vitamin D]] or derivatives have been employed, apparently with success.
* Some lab tests on mice with CLC-5-related tubular damage showed a high-[[citrate]] diet preserved renal function and delayed progress of renal disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cebotaru V, Kaul S, Devuyst O, ''et al.'' |title=High citrate diet delays progression of renal insufficiency in the ClC-5 knockout mouse model of Dent's disease |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=642–52 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16014041 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00442.x }}</ref>
