A "'''mucous cyst of the oral mucosa'''"<ref name="Bolognia" /> (also known as a "'''mucocele'''"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>) is a clinical term that refers to two related phenomena: '''mucus extravasation phenomenon''', and '''mucus retention cyst'''. The former is a [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of [[connective tissue]] consisting of collected [[mucin]] due to a ruptured [[salivary gland]] [[duct (anatomy)|duct]] usually caused by local trauma, in the case of mucus extravasation phenomenon, and an obstructed or ruptured salivary duct ([[Parotid duct]]) in the case of a mucus retention cyst. [[Inflammation]] of sinuses can also cause this condition.
The mucocele has a bluish translucent color, and is more commonly found in children and young adults. 

It can be considered a [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]]<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:mucocele">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/five/000067885.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:mucocele |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> or a [[cyst]].<ref>{{MeshName|Mucocele}}</ref>

==Locations==
The most common location to find a mucocele is the surface of the lower lip. It can also be found on the inner side of the cheek (known as the [[buccal mucosa]]), on the anterior ventral [[tongue]], and the floor of the [[mouth]]. When found on the floor of the mouth, the mucocele is referred to as a [[ranula]]. They are rarely found on the upper lip. As their name suggests they are basically mucus lined cysts and they can also occur in the Paranasal sinuses most commonly the frontal sinuses, the frontoethomidal region and also in the maxillary sinus. Sphenoid sinus involvement is extremely rare. 
When the lumen of the vermiform appendix gets blocked due to any factor, again a mucocele can form.

==Characteristics==
The size of oral mucoceles vary from 1&nbsp;mm to several centimeters and they usually are slightly transparent with a blue tinge. On palpation, mucoceles may appear fluctuant but can also be firm. Their duration lasts from days to years, and may have recurrent swelling with occasional rupturing of its contents.

==Variations==
A variant of a mucocele is found on the [[palate]], [[retromolar pad]], and posterior buccal mucosa. Known as a "superficial mucocele", this type presents as single or multiple [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and bursts into an ulcer. Despite healing after a few days, superficial mucoceles recur often in the same location.

==Histology==

Microscopically, mucoceles appears as [[granulation tissue]] surrounding mucin. Since [[inflammation]] occurs concurrently, [[neutrophil]]s and foamy [[histiocyte]]s usually are present.

==Treatment==

Some mucoceles spontaneously resolve on their own after a short time. Others are chronic and require surgical removal. Recurrence may occur, and thus the adjacent salivary gland is excised as a preventive measure.

Several types of procedures are available for the surgical removal of mucoceles. These include laser and minimally-invasive techniques which means recovery times are reduced drastically.

Micro-marsupialization is an alternative procedure to surgical removal. Micro-marsupialization uses silk sutures in the dome of a cyst to allow new epithelialized drainage pathways. It is simpler, less traumatic, and well-tolerated by patients, especially children.<ref>{{cite journal|last=PIAZZETTA|first=CLETO M.|coauthors=TORRES-PEREIRA, CASSIUS; AMENÁBAR, JOSÉ M.|title=Micro-marsupialization as an alternative treatment for mucocele in pediatric dentistry|journal=International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry|date=1 September 2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=318–323|doi=10.1111/j.1365-263X.2011.01198.x|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22092694}}</ref>

A non-surgical option that may be effective for a small or newly identified mucocele is to rinse the mouth thoroughly with salt water (one tablespoon of salt per cup) four to six times a day for a few days. This may draw out the fluid trapped underneath the skin without further damaging the surrounding tissue. If the mucocele persists, individuals should see a dentist to discuss further treatment.

Smaller cysts may be removed by laser treatment, larger cysts will have to be removed surgically in an operating room.
