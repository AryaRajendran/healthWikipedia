A '''semen analysis''' (plural: semen analyses) evaluates certain characteristics of a male's [[semen]] and the [[spermatozoon|sperm]] contained therein.  It is done to help evaluate male fertility, whether for those seeking pregnancy or verifying the success of [[vasectomy]].  Depending on the measurement method, just a few characteristics may be evaluated (such as with a home kit) or many characteristics may be evaluated (generally by a diagnostic laboratory).  Collection techniques and precise measurement method may influence results.

==Reasons for testing==
The most common reasons for laboratory semen analysis in humans are as part of a couple's [[infertility]] investigation and after a [[vasectomy]] to verify that the procedure was successful. It is also commonly used for testing human donors for [[sperm donation]], and for animals semen analysis is commonly used in [[stud farming]] and farm [[animal breeding]].  

Occasionally a man will have a semen analysis done as part of routine pre-pregnancy testing.  At the laboratory level this is rare, as most doctors will not test the semen and sperm unless specifically requested or there is a strong suspicion of a pathology in one of these areas discovered during the medical history or during the physical examination. Such testing is very expensive and time-consuming, and in the U.S. is unlikely to be covered by insurance.

==Relation to fertility==
The characteristics measured by semen analysis are only some of the factors in [[semen quality]].  One source states that 30% of men with a normal semen analysis actually have abnormal sperm function.<!--

 --> In [[NICE guidelines]], ''mild male factor infertility'' is defined as when 2 or more semen analyses have 1 or more variables below the 5th [[percentile]], and confers a chance of pregnancy occurring
naturally through vaginal intercourse within 2 years similar to people with mild [[endometriosis]].<ref>[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems]. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]] CG156 - Issued: February 2013</ref>

==Collection methods==
{{See|Semen collection}}
The most common way to collect a semen sample is through [[masturbation]], directing the sample into a clean cup.<ref name="webmd" />

A sample may also be collected during intercourse in a special type of [[condom]] known as a '''[[collection condom]]'''.  Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as [[latex]] is somewhat harmful to sperm.<!--
 --> Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation, and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely.  Adherents of religions that prohibit contraception may use collection condoms with holes pricked in them.<ref>{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley | coauthors=Sheila Kippley | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th addition | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2 | pages=306–307}}</ref>

A third option for collecting a sample is through [[coitus interruptus]] (withdrawal).  With this technique, the man removes his penis from his partner near the end of intercourse and ejaculates into a cup. 

Finally, if a blockage in the [[vas deferens]] is suspected to impede fertility, semen can be taken directly from the [[epididymis]]. Such a collection is called [[per cutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration]] (PESA). Alternatively, the testicular tissue itself, instead of the sperm produced can be investigated. Then, the collecting method is called '''TESE'''.<ref>[http://stockholm.fertilitetscentrum.se/utredningar_kirurgiskt.aspx Fertility Center, Stockholm (translated from Swedish)]</ref>

==Parameters==
Examples of parameters measured in a semen analysis are: sperm count, motility, morphology, volume, fructose level and pH.

===Sperm count===
[[Image:Success rates by amount of sperm.svg|thumb|right|250px|Approximate [[pregnancy rate]] varies with amount of sperm used in an artificial insemination cycle. Values are for intrauterine insemination, with sperm number in ''total sperm count'', which may be approximately twice the ''total motile sperm count''.]]

Sperm count, or ''sperm concentration'' to avoid mixup, measures the concentration of sperm in a man's ejaculate, distinguished from ''total sperm count'', which is the sperm count multiplied with volume.<ref>[http://www.sharedjourney.com/define/semen.html sharedjourney.com - Male Infertility Testing]</ref> Over 15<ref name=who2010/> million sperm per milliliter is considered normal, according to the WHO in 2010. Older definitions state 20 million.<ref name="stonybrook" /><ref name="webmd" /> A lower sperm count is considered [[oligospermia|oligozoospermia]]. A vasectomy is considered successful if the sample is [[Azoospermia|azoospermic]]. Some define success with rare non-motile sperm are observed (fewer than 100,000 per millilitre).<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rajmil O, Fernández M, Rojas-Cruz C, Sevilla C, Musquera M, Ruiz-Castañe E |title=Azoospermia should not be given as the result of vasectomy |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Arch. Esp. Urol. |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=55–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17408173 }}<br>
{{cite journal |author=Dhar NB, Bhatt A, Jones JS |title=Determining the success of vasectomy |journal=BJU Int. |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=773–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16536771 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06107.x}}</ref> Others advocate obtaining a second semen analysis to verify the counts are not increasing (as can happen with re-canalization) and others still may perform a repeat vasectomy for this situation.

The average sperm count today is between 20 and 40 million per milliliter in the Western world, having decreased by 1-2% per year from a substantially higher number decades ago.<ref>[http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/iju/vol2n1/sperm.xml The sperm count has been decreasing steadily for many years in Western industrialized countries: Is there an endocrine basis for this decrease?] The Internet Journal of Urology TM. ISSN: 1528-8390</ref>

Chips for home use are emerging that can give an accurate estimation of sperm count after three samples taken on different days. Such a chip may measure the concentration of sperm in a semen sample against a control liquid filled with polystyrene beads.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-01/counting-chip-provides-cheap-home-sperm-counting  New Chip Provides Cheap At-Home Sperm Counting] By Stuart Fox Posted 01.26.2010 in Popular Science</ref>

===Total sperm count===
''Total sperm count'', or ''total sperm number'', is the total number of spermatozoa in the entire ejaculate. By WHO, lower [[reference limit]] (2.5th percentile) is 39 million per ejaculate.  The median ejaculation (50th percentile) contained 255 million sperm.<ref name=who2010/>

===Motility===
 
The [[World Health Organization]] has a value of 50% and this must be measured within 60 minutes of collection. WHO also has a parameter of ''vitality'', with a lower [[reference limit]] of 60% live spermatozoa.<ref name=who2010/> A man can have a total number of sperm far over the limit of 20 million sperm cells per milliliter, but still have bad quality because too few of them are motile. However, if the sperm count is very high, then a low motility (for example, less than 60%) might not matter, because the fraction might still be more than 8 million per millilitre. The other way around, a man can have a sperm count far less than 20 million sperm cells per millilitre and still have good motility, if more than 60% of those observed sperm cells show good forward movement.

A more specified measure is ''motility grade'', where the motility of sperm are divided into four different grades:<ref>[http://www.sharedjourney.com/define/semen2.html Shared Journey: Semen Analysis]</ref>

* '''Grade a''': Sperm with progressive motility. These are the strongest and swim fast in a straight line. Sometimes it is also denoted motility '''IV'''.
* '''Grade b''': (non-linear motility): These also move forward but tend to travel in a curved or crooked motion. Sometimes also denoted motility '''III'''.
* '''Grade c''': These have non-progressive motility because they do not move forward despite the fact that they move their tails. Sometimes also denoted motility '''II'''.
* '''Grade d''': These are immotile and fail to move at all. Sometimes also denoted motility '''I'''.

===Morphology===
Regarding sperm [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], the WHO criteria as described in 2010 state that a sample is normal (samples from men whose partners had a pregnancy in the last 12 months) if 4% (or 5th centile) or more of the observed sperm have normal morphology.<ref name=who2010/> 

Morphology is a predictor of success in fertilizing oocytes during [[in vitro fertilization]].

Up to 10% of all spermatozoa have observable defects and as such are disadvantaged in terms of fertilising an oocyte.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sadler|first=T.|title=Langman's medical embryology.|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott William & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-9069-7|pages=30|edition=11th ed.}}</ref> 

Also, sperm cells with tail-tip swelling patterns generally have lower frequency of [[aneuploidy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pang MG, You YA, Park YJ, Oh SA, Kim DS, Kim YJ |title=Numerical chromosome abnormalities are associated with sperm tail swelling patterns |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 94|issue= 3|pages= 1012–1020|year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19505688 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.043 |url=}}</ref>

===Volume===
WebMD advises that semen volumes between 1.0&nbsp;[[milliliters|mL]] and 6.5&nbsp;mL are normal;<ref name="webmd" /> WHO regards 1.5 ml as the lower [[reference limit]].<ref name=who2010>{{cite journal |author=Cooper TG, Noonan E, von Eckardstein S, ''et al.'' |title=World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=231–45 |year=2010 |pmid=19934213 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp048 |url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/infertility/cooper_et_al_hru.pdf}}</ref> Low volume may indicate partial or complete blockage of the [[seminal vesicle]]s, or that the man was born without seminal vesicles.<ref name="stonybrook" /> In clinical practice, a volume of less than 2 mL in the setting of infertility and absent sperm should prompt an evaluation for obstructive [[azoospermia]].  A caveat to this is be sure it has been at least 48 hours since the last ejaculation to time of sample collection.

===Fructose level===
Regarding the level of [[fructose]] in the semen,  WebMD lists normal as at least 3&nbsp;<sup>[[milligrams|mg]]</sup>/<sub>mL</sub>.<ref name="webmd" />  WHO specifies a normal level of 13&nbsp;μ[[Mole (unit)|mol]] per sample.  Absence of fructose may indicate a problem with the seminal vesicles.<ref name="stonybrook" />

===pH===
WebMD lists a normal [[pH]] range of 7.1-8.0;<ref name="webmd" /> WHO criteria specify normal as 7.2-7.8.<ref name="stonybrook" />  Acidic ejaculate (lower pH value) may indicate one or both of the seminal vesicles are blocked.  A basic ejaculate (higher pH value) may indicate an [[infection]].<ref name="stonybrook" />  A pH value outside of the normal range is harmful to sperm.<ref name="webmd" />

===Liquefaction===
The [[Liquification|liquefaction]] is the process when the gel formed by proteins from the seminal vesicles is broken up and the semen becomes more liquid. It normally takes less than 20 minutes for the sample to change from a thick [[gel]] into a [[liquid]]. In the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] guidelines, a liquefaction time within 60 minutes is regarded as within normal ranges.<ref name=nice>[http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG011publicinfoenglish.pdf] {{cite book |author= |title=Fertility: Assessment and Treatment for People with Fertility Problems |publisher=RCOG Press |location=London |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-900364-97-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===MOT===
MOT is a measure of how many million sperm cells per ml are highly motile,<ref>[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7175 Cryos International - What does MOT mean?]</ref> that is, approximately of grade a (>25 micrometer per 5 sek. at room temperature) and grade b (>25 micrometer per 25 sek. at room temperature). Thus, it is a combination of sperm count and motility.

With a straw <ref>[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7179 Cryos International - What is a straw?]</ref> or a vial volume of 0.5 milliliter, the general guideline is that, for [[intracervical insemination]] (ICI), straws or vials making a total of 20 million motile spermatozoa in total is recommended. This is equal to 8 straws or vials 0.5 ml with MOT5, or 2 straws or vials of MOT20. For [[intrauterine insemination]] (IUI), 1-2 MOT5 straws or vials is regarded sufficient.<ref>[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7169 Cryos International - How much sperm should I order?]</ref> In WHO terms, it is thus recommended to use approximately 20 million grade a+b sperm in ICI, and 2 million grade a+b in IUI.

===Total motile spermatozoa===
''Total motile spermatozoa'' (TMS)<ref name=merviel>{{cite journal |author=Merviel P, Heraud MH, Grenier N, Lourdel E, Sanguinet P, Copin H |title=Predictive factors for pregnancy after intrauterine insemination (IUI): An analysis of 1038 cycles and a review of the literature |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 1|pages= 79–88|year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18996517 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.09.058 |url=}}</ref> or ''total motile sperm count'' (TMSC)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pasqualotto EB, Daitch JA, Hendin BN, ''et al.'' |title=Relationship of total motile sperm count and percentage motile sperm to successful pregnancy rates following intrauterine insemination |journal=J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=476–82 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10530401 |doi= 10.1023/A:1020598916080|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1058-0468&volume=16&page=476}}</ref> is a combination of sperm count, motility and volume, measuring how many million sperm cells in an entire ejaculate are motile.

Use of approximately 20 million sperm of motility grade c or d in ICI, and 5 million ones in IUI may be an approximate recommendation.

===Others===
The NICE guidelines also include testing ''vitality'', with normal ranges defined as more than 75% of sperm cells alive.<ref name=nice/>

The sample may also be tested for [[white blood cell]]s.  A high level of white blood cells (over 1 million per milliliter) may indicate an infection.<ref name="stonybrook" />

==Abnormalities==
* [[Aspermia]]: absence of semen
* [[Azoospermia]]: absence of sperm
* [[Hypospermia]]: low semen volume
* [[Oligozoospermia]]: low sperm count
* [[Asthenozoospermia]]: poor sperm motility
* [[Teratozoospermia]]: sperm carry more morphological defects than usual
* [[Necrozoospermia]]: all sperm in the ejaculate are dead

==Factors that influence results==
Apart from the [[semen quality]] itself, there are various methodological factors that may influence the results, giving rise to [[inter-method variation]].

Compared to samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis.

If the results from a man's first sample are subfertile, they must be verified with at least two more analyses.  At least 2 to 4 weeks must be allowed between each analysis.<!--

A man may prefer to produce his sample at home rather than at the clinic.  The site of semen collection does ''not'' affect the results of a semen analysis.<!--

==Measurement methods==
Volume can be determined by measuring the weight of the sample container, knowing the mass of the empty container. Sperm count and morphology can be calculated by microscopy. Sperm count can also be estimated by kits that measure the amount of a sperm-associated protein, and are suitable for home use.<ref>[http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/charlottesville_company_sends_out_its_home_male_sterility_tests/40086/ dailyprogress.com &gt; Charlottesville company sends out its home male sterility tests] By Brian McNeill.

'''''Computer Assisted Semen Analysis''''' (CASA) is a catch-all phrase for automatic or semi-automatic semen analysis techniques. Most systems are based on [[image analysis]], but alternative methods exist such as tracking cell movement on a [[digitizing tablet]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mortimer ST |title=CASA--practical aspects |journal=J.
