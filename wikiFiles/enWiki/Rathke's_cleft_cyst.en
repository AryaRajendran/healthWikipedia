A '''Rathke's cleft cyst''' is a benign growth found on the [[pituitary gland]] in the brain, specifically a fluid-filled [[cyst]] in the posterior portion of the anterior pituitary gland.{{r|ucla2009|medscape2008}} It occurs when the [[Rathke's pouch]] does not develop properly, and ranges in size from 2 to 40mm in diameter.{{r|medscape2008}}

Asymptomatic cysts are common, detected during autopsies of 2 to 26 percent of individuals who have died of unrelated causes. Females are twice as likely as males to have a cyst.{{r|medscape2008}} Symptomatic cysts can trigger visual disturbances, pituitary dysfunction and headaches.{{r|ucla2009}} Close to half of symptomatic individuals have a visual disturbance, with less common symptoms including [[diabetes insipidus]], [[amenorrhoea]], and [[galactorrhea]].{{r|medscape2008}}

The treatment of choice for symptomatic cysts is drainage and taking a biopsy.{{r|medscape2008followup|ouhsc2004}} Radical excision is more dangerous, because it damages surrounding brain structures, and can cause more bleeding.

The first Rathke's cleft cyst recognized was found during an autopsy in 1913.{{r|medscape2008}}
