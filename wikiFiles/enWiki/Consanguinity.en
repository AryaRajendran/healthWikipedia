'''Consanguinity''' ("blood relation", from the Latin ''[[:wikt: consanguinitas|consanguinitas]]'') refers to the property of being from the same [[kinship]] as another person. In that respect, consanguinity is the quality of being descended from the same [[ancestor]] as another person.  The [[law]]s of many jurisdictions set out degrees of consanguinity in relation to prohibited sexual relations and marriage parties or whether a given person inherits property when a deceased person has not left a will.

The degree of relative consanguinity can be illustrated with a '''consanguinity table''', in which each level of lineal consanguinity (i.e., [[generation]], i.e. [[meiosis]]) appears as a row, and individuals with a collaterally consanguineous relationship share the same row.<ref>See, e.g., [http://web.archive.org/web/20110607234837/http://www.sleepyhollowcemetery.org/PDF/consanguinity.pdf table of consanguinity]</ref> The Knot System is a numerical notation that defines consanguinity.<ref>HÃ¸jrup, Knud, [http://www.knotsystem.dk "The Knot System: A Numeric Notation of Relationship"], ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'', Volume 84, Number 2, page 115, June 1996, (ISSN 0027-934X)</ref>

===Modern secular law===
Issues of consanguinity arise in several aspects of the law. It is directly relevant in determining whether a couple can marry. These are linked to a jurisdiction's definition of [[incest]], so that couples in an incestuous relationship will not be permitted to marry. Some United States jurisdictions forbid first-cousins to marry, while others limit the prohibition to brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles. 

Several volumes of ''Smith's Laws'', enacted from 1700 through 1829, contain certain public and private laws of the Province and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Several laws with a prescribed punishment against adultery, bigamy, incest and fornication and all combinations of those crimes were enacted in 1705.<ref>{{cite web |volume=I |work=Smith's Laws |title=The table of degrees of consanguinity and affinity |url=http://www.palrb.us/smithlaws/17001799/1705/0/act/0122.pdf |format=PDF |year=1705 |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}</ref>

Consanguinity is also relevant in issues of [[inheritance]]. In regard to the law of [[Intestacy|intestate succession]] (when a person dies without a will), under the [[Uniform Probate Code]] of the [[United States]] section 2-103, after a surviving spouse receives his or her share, the descendants (depending on the circumstances this may include children, grandchildren, or great grandchildren, either biological or adopted) receive the remainder of the intestate estate. If there are no children, the decedent's parent(s) receive the remainder of the estate. If there are neither descendants nor parents, the decedent's estate is distributed to descendants of the decedent's parents (again, depending on the circumstances, brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, grand nieces and nephews and great grand nieces and nephews). If there are no descendants, parents, or descendants of parents, then the deceased's property passes to descendants of the grandparents of the decedent (uncles and aunts, first cousins, or first cousins once, twice, or thrice removed, second cousins, third cousins etc).

Also, some jurisdictions prohibit individuals from serving on a [[jury]] in which they have a certain degree of consanguinity with the [[defendant]].<ref>{{cite web

[[Adoption]] may or may not be considered at law to create such a bond; in most Western societies, adoptive relationships are considered blood relationships for these purposes, but in others, including both Japan and ancient Rome, it was common for a couple with only daughters to adopt a son-in-law, making the marriage one between adoptive siblings.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Religious and traditional law===
Under Roman civil law, which early [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law of the Catholic Church]] followed, couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity.<ref>Constance Bouchard, ''Those of My Blood: Creating Noble Families in Medieval Francia'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 40</ref> In the ninth century the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven and changed the method by which they were calculated.<ref>Constance B. Bouchard, 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', Speculum, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 269-70</ref> Eventually the nobility became too interrelated to marry as the pool of non-related perspective spouses became smaller. It was either defy the church's position or look elsewhere for eligible marriage candidates.<ref>Constance B. Bouchard, 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', Speculum, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 270, 271</ref> In 1215 the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] made what they believed was a necessary change to canon law reducing the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from seven back to four.<ref>John W. Baldwin, ''The Language of Sex: Five Voices from Northern France around 1200'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), p. 78</ref> The method of calculating prohibited degrees was changed also.<ref name="CNM270">Constance B. Bouchard, 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', ''Speculum'', Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), p. 270</ref>  Instead of the former practice of counting up to the common ancestor then down to the proposed spouse, the new law computed consanguinity by counting back to the common ancestor.<ref name="CNM270"/> In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], unknowingly marrying a closely consanguineous blood relative was grounds for an [[annulment]], but during the eleventh and twelfth centuries [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]]s were granted with increasing frequency due to the thousands of persons encompassed in the prohibition at seven degrees and the hardships this posed for finding potential spouses.<ref name="LSCS356">James A. Brundage, ''Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995), p. 356</ref> After 1215 the general rule was that while fourth cousins could marry without dispensation, generally the need for dispensations was greatly reduced.<ref name="LSCS356"/> In fourteenth century England, for example, papal dispensations for annulments due to consanguinity (and [[Affinity (canon law)|affinity]]) were relatively few.<ref> R. H. Helmholz, ''Marriage Litigation in Medieval England'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 86</ref>

The connotations of degree of consanguinity varies by context (e.g., [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], [[Roman law]], etc.). Most cultures define a degree of consanguinity within which sexual interrelationships are regarded as [[incest]]uous (the "[[prohibited degree of kinship]]").

Among the Christian ''Habesha'' highlanders of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] (the predominantly orthodox Christian [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigray-Tigrinya]]), it is a tradition to be able to recount one's paternal ancestors at least 7 generations away starting from early childhood, because "those with a common patrilineal ancestor less than seven generations away are considered 'brother and sister' and may not marry." The rule is less strict on the mother's side, where the limit is about four generations back, but still determined patrilinearly. This rule does not apply to Muslims or other ethnic groups.<ref>Wolbert Smidt, "Genealogy" in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'', (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p.743.</ref>

[[Ayurveda]] clearly states that marriage within the [[Gotra]] is a consanguineous marriage which can lead to many gestational and genetic problems in the fetus. So it has become a common practice in the Hindu households during pre-marriage discussions to ask the couples' Gotra. Couples of the same Gotra are advised not to marry. The advisers of this system say that this practice definitely helps in reducing the gestational problems and ensures a healthy progeny.

==Genetic definitions==
[[File:Gene-distribution.png|thumb|A simplistic depiction of genetic relatedness after ''n'' generations as a 2<sup>-n</sup> progression.]]
The percentage of consanguinity between any two individuals decreases fourfold as the [[most recent common ancestor]] recedes one generation. 
Consanguinity, as commonly defined, does not depend on the amount of shared  [[DNA]] within two people's [[genome]]. It rather counts the number of [[meioses]] separating two individuals. Because of the effects of [[pedigree collapse]], this does not directly translate into the amount of shared genetic substance.

It is common to distinguish first-degree cousins, second-degree cousins, and often also third-degree cousins. Since comparatively few people can trace their full family tree for more than four generations, the identity of fourth-degree cousins often cannot be established. 
Also at a genetic level, half-fourth cousins typically do not exhibit greater genetic similarity with one another than with any other individual from the same population.<ref>[http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=284 Ask a Geneticist] - Understanding Genetics: Human Health and the Genome - (by Dr. Erin Cline Davis, 23andMe Edited by Dr. DB Starr, Stanford University (October 10, 2008)</ref> 

[[Cousin#Double cousins|Double first cousin]]s are descended from two pairs of siblings, and have the same genetic similarity as half-siblings.

Conventionally, genetic consanguinity is expressed as defined by Wright<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Sewall | authorlink = Sewall Wright | year = 1922 | title = Coefficients of inbreeding and relationship | url = | journal = [[American Naturalist]] | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 330â338 }}</ref> with the [[coefficient of relationship]] ''r'' defined on the Wikipedia page [[Coefficient of relationship]].
''r'' is defined as the fraction of homozygous due to the consanguinity under discussion. Thus, a parent and child pair has a value of ''r''=0.5, siblings have a value of ''r''=0.5, a parent's sibling has ''r''=0.25, and first cousins have ''r''=0.125.

As a working definition, unions contracted between persons biologically related as second cousins or closer (''r'' â¥ 0.0156) are categorized as consanguineous. This arbitrary limit has been chosen because the genetic influence in marriages between couples related to a lesser degree would usually be expected to differ only slightly from that observed in the general population. 

Globally, the most common form of consanguineous union contracted is between first cousins, in which the spouses share 1/8 of their genes inherited from a common ancestor, and so their progeny are [[zygosity|homozygous]] (or more correctly autozygous) at 1/16 of all loci (''r'' = 0.0625).{{dubious|date=January 2012}}

==Rates of occurrence==
Historically, some [[Europe]]an nobles cited a close degree of consanguinity when they required convenient grounds for [[divorce]], especially in contexts where [[Religion|religious]] doctrine forbade the voluntary dissolution of an unhappy or childless marriage.<ref>James A. Brundage, ''Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995), p. 193</ref> Conversely, the consanguinity law of [[Order of succession|succession]] requires the next [[monarch]] to be of the same blood of the previous one; allowing, for example, [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] children to inherit.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

It is estimated that 55% of marriages between Mirpuri (Kashmiri) Pakistani Muslim immigrants in the United Kingdom are between first cousins,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consang.net |title=Consanguinity/Endogamy Resource |accessdate=2007-12-31 |first=International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Stanley | last=Kurtz | coauthors= | title=Assimilation Studies, Part II | date=2007-03-22 | publisher= | url =http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzQzMjVhNzg2Nzg2ZmVkMjFhY2JiZjkwMmFjYzIwYjc= | work =National Review Online | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-31 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Rashmee Roshan | last=Lall | coauthors= | title=Ban UK Pakistanis from Marrying Cousing | date=2005-11-17 | publisher= | url =http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1298135,curpg-1.cms | work =The Times of India | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-31 | language = }}</ref> where "preferential patrilateral parallel cousin marriage" (where a boy marries his father's brother's daughter) is often favored.

==Genetic disorders==
{{See|Inbreeding}}

The offspring of consanguinous relationships are at greater risk of certain genetic disorders. [[Autosomal recessive]] disorders occur in individuals who are [[homozygous]] for a particular recessive gene [[mutation]]. This means that they carry two copies ([[alleles]]) of the same gene. Except in certain rare circumstances (new mutations or [[uniparental disomy]]) both parents of an individual with such a disorder will be carriers of the gene. Such carriers are not affected and will not display any signs that they are carriers, and so may be unaware that they carry the mutated gene. As relatives share a proportion of their genes, it is much more likely that related parents will be carriers of an autosomal recessive gene, and therefore their children are at a higher risk of an autosomal recessive disorder. The extent to which the risk increases depends on the degree of genetic relationship between the parents; so the risk is greater in mating relationships where the parents are close relatives, but for relationships between more distant relatives, such as second cousins, the risk is lower (although still greater than the general population).<ref>Kingston H M, "ABC of Clinical Genetics", Page 7, 3rd Edition (2002), BMJ Books, London, 0-7279-1627-0</ref>

The low genetic [[heterozygosity]] associated with increased consanguinity in a population (identified by [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] markers) increases its susceptibility to infectious [[pathogen]]s such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[hepatitis]].<ref>Lyons EJ, Frodsham AJ, Zhang L, Hill AV, Amos W. (2009). Consanguinity and susceptibility to infectious diseases in humans. Biol Lett. 23;5(4):574-6. {{doi|10.1098/rsbl.2009.0133}} PMID 19324620</ref>
