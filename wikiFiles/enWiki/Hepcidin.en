'''Hepcidin''' is a [[peptide hormone]] produced by the [[liver]]. It was discovered in 2000, and appears to be the master regulator of [[human iron metabolism|iron homeostasis]] in humans and other [[mammal]]s.<ref name="pmid12663437">{{cite journal|author=Ganz T|title=Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism and mediator of anemia of inflammation|journal=Blood|volume=102|issue=3|pages=783–8|year=2003|month=August|pmid=12663437|doi=10.1182/blood-2003-03-0672|url=|issn=}}</ref>  Hepcidin functions to regulate (inhibit) iron transport across the gut mucosa, thereby preventing excess iron absorption and maintaining normal iron levels within the body. Hepcidin also inhibits transport of iron out of macrophages (where iron is stored). Thus, in states of high hepcidin levels (including inflammatory states), serum iron levels can drop because iron is trapped inside macrophages. This leads to anemia. In humans, ''[[HAMP]]'' is the [[gene]] that encodes for hepcidin.

==Structure==
Hepcidin preprohormone, prohormone, and hormone sizes are 84, 60, and 25 amino acids, respectively. Twenty- and 22-amino acid metabolites of hepcidin also exist in the urine. The ''N''-terminal region is required for function; deletion of 5 ''N''-terminal amin acids results in loss of function. The conversion of prohepcidin to hepcidin is mediated by the prohormone convertase [[furin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Valore|first=EV|coauthors=Ganz, T|title=Posttranslational processing of hepcidin in human hepatocytes is mediated by the prohormone convertase furin.|journal=Blood cells, molecules & diseases|date=2008 Jan-Feb|volume=40|issue=1|pages=132–8|pmid=17905609}}</ref>
This conversion may be regulated by alpha-1 [[antitrypsin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pandur|first=E|coauthors=Nagy, J, Poór, VS, Sarnyai, A, Huszár, A, Miseta, A, Sipos, K|title=Alpha-1 antitrypsin binds preprohepcidin intracellularly and prohepcidin in the serum.|journal=The FEBS journal|date=2009 Apr|volume=276|issue=7|pages=2012–21|pmid=19292870}}</ref> 

Hepcidin is a tightly folded polypeptide with 32% [[beta sheet]] character and a [[Stem-loop|hairpin]] structure stabilized by 4 [[disulfide]] [[Chemical bond|bond]]s. The structure of hepcidin has determined through solution [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]].<ref name="pmid12138110"/>  NMR studies showed a new model for hepcidin: at ambient temperatures, the protein interconverts between two conformations, which could be individually resolved by temperature variation. The solution structure of hepcidin was determined at 325 K and 253 K in supercooled water.  X-ray analysis of a [[co-crystal]] with Fab revealed a structure similar to the high-temperature NMR structure.<ref name="pmid19553669">{{PDB|3H0T}}; {{cite journal|author=Jordan JB, Poppe L, Haniu M, Arvedson T, Syed R, Li V, Kohno H, Kim H, Schnier PD, Harvey TS, Miranda LP, Cheetham J, Sasu BJ|title=Hepcidin revisited, disulfide connectivity, dynamics, and structure|journal=J.

==Function==
The 25-amino acid peptide of hepcidin is secreted by the liver and is considered the "master regulator" of [[iron metabolism]]. Hepcidin inhibits iron transport by binding to the iron export channel [[ferroportin]], which is located on the basolateral surface of gut [[enterocytes]] and the plasma membrane of reticuloendothelial cells ([[macrophages]]). Inhibiting ferroportin prevents iron from being exported and the iron is sequestered in the cells.<ref name="pmid16450011">{{cite journal|author=Rossi E|title=Hepcidin--the iron regulatory hormone|journal=Clin Biochem Rev|volume=26|issue=3|pages=47–9|year=2005|month=August|pmid=16450011|pmc=1240030|doi=|url=|issn=}}</ref> By inhibiting ferroportin, hepcidin prevents [[enterocytes]] of the intestines from secreting iron into the [[hepatic portal system]], thereby functionally reducing iron absorption. The iron release from macrophages is also prevented by ferroportin inhibition; therefore, the hepcidin maintains iron homeostasis. Hepcidin activity is also partially responsible for iron sequestration seen in anemia of chronic disease, and levels are elevated in people with [[renal failure]].<ref name="pmid19212416">{{cite journal|author=Ashby DR, Gale DP, Busbridge M, ''et al.''|title=Plasma hepcidin levels are elevated but responsive to erythropoietin therapy in renal disease|journal=Kidney Int.|volume=75|issue=9|pages=976–81|year=2009|month=May|pmid=19212416|doi=10.1038/ki.2009.21|url=}}</ref>

Several mutations in hepcidin result in [[juvenile hemochromatosis]]. The majority of juvenile hemochromatosis cases are due to mutations in [[hemojuvelin]], a regulator of hepcidin production. 

Hepcidin has shown fairly consistent [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] activity. Hepcidin's [[antibacterial]] activity currently seems to be inconsistent. The current scientific evidence suggests that hepcidin is a central regulatory hormone, and its main action is to regulate systemic iron homeostasis.

==History==
The peptide was initially reported as LEAP-1, for Liver-Expressed Antimicrobial Protein and later became known as hepcidin.<ref name="pmid11034317">{{cite journal|author=Krause A, Neitz S, Mägert HJ, Schulz A, Forssmann WG, Schulz-Knappe P, Adermann K|title=LEAP-1, a novel highly disulfide-bonded human peptide, exhibits antimicrobial activity|journal=FEBS Lett.|volume=480|issue=2–3|pages=147–50|year=2000|month=September|pmid=11034317|doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01920-7|url=|issn=}}</ref> Independently, in a search for [[antimicrobial peptides]], researchers working in the lab of [[Tomas Ganz]] discovered a peptide associated with inflammation, and named it "hepcidin" after observing that it was produced in the liver ("hep-") and appeared to have bactericidal properties ("-cide" for "killing").<ref name="pmid11113131">{{cite journal|author=Park CH, Valore EV, Waring AJ, Ganz T|title=Hepcidin, a urinary antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver|journal=J.

Hepcidin was first discovered in [[human]] [[urine]] and [[Blood serum|serum]] in 2000. Most understandings of hepcidin regulation and action comes from [[in vitro]] and mice studies that often use hepcidin [[mRNA]] expression as a read-out. Carrying out studies in humans is difficult due to the lack of suitable hepcidin [[assay]]. With the recent developments of assays to measure hepcidin in serum and urine, new opportunities to study the regulation of hepcidin in humans have arisen. Only a few laboratories are able to perform these assays at the current moment. The aim of the studies is to discuss insights into hepcidin regulation obtained from recent clinical studies in the light of findings from in vitro and mice studies. Ongoing studies in humans should provide us with more information on the etiology of iron metabolism disorders in order to create new therapeutic strategies and improve differential diagnosis protocols for these diseases.<ref name="pmid18166790">{{cite journal|author=Kemna EH, Tjalsma H, Willems HL, Swinkels DW|title=Hepcidin: from discovery to differential diagnosis|journal=Haematologica|volume=93|issue=1|pages=90–7|year=2008|month=January|pmid=18166790|doi=10.3324/haematol.11705|url=|issn=}}</ref>

Soon after this discovery, researchers discovered that hepcidin production in [[mouse|mice]] increases in conditions of iron overload as well as in inflammation. [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically modified]] mice engineered to overexpress hepcidin died shortly after birth with severe iron deficiency, again suggesting a central and not redundant role in iron regulation. The first evidence that linked hepcidin to the clinical condition known as the [[anemia of chronic disease|anemia of inflammation]] came from the lab of [[Nancy Andrews (biologist)|Nancy Andrews]] in Boston when researchers looked at tissue from two patients with liver [[tumor]]s with a severe [[microcytic anemia]] that did not respond to [[iron supplement]]s. The tumor tissue appeared to be overproducing hepcidin, and contained large quantities of hepcidin [[messenger RNA|mRNA]]. Removing the tumors surgically cured the anemia.

Taken together, these discoveries suggested that hepcidin regulates the release of iron in the body.

== Clinical significance ==

[[β-thalassemia|Beta-thalassemia]] is one of the most common [[congenital]] [[anemias]] arising from partial or complete lack of β-globin synthesis. Excessive iron absorption is one of the main features of [[β-thalassemia]] and can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. The serial analyses of β-thalassemic mice indicate [[hemoglobin]] levels decreases over time, while the concentration of iron in the [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[kidneys]] markedly increases. The overload of iron is associated with low levels of hepcidin.  It was found that patients with [[β-thalassemia]] also have low hepcidin levels. The observations led researchers to hypothesize that more iron is absorbed in [[β-thalassemia]] than is required for [[erythropoiesis]] and whether increasing the concentration of hepcidin in the body of such patients might be therapeutic, limiting iron overload. It was demonstrated that a moderate increase in expression of hepcidin in β-thalassemic mice limits iron overload, decreases formation of insoluble [[membrane-bound]] globins and reactive oxygen species, and improves anemia. Mice with increased hepcidin expression also demonstrated an increase in the lifespan of their [[red cells]], reversal of ineffective [[erythropoiesis]] and [[splenomegaly]], and an increase in total [[hemoglobin]] levels. The data led the researchers to suggest [[therapeutics]] that could increase hepcidin levels or act as hepcidin [[agonists]] might help treat the abnormal iron absorption in individuals with [[β-thalassemia]] and related disorders.<ref name="pmid21099112">{{cite journal|author=Gardenghi S, Ramos P, Marongiu MF, Melchiori L, Breda L, Guy E, Muirhead K, Rao N, Roy CN, Andrews NC, Nemeth E, Follenzi A, An X, Mohandas N, Ginzburg Y, Rachmilewitz EA, Giardina PJ, Grady RW, Rivella S|title=Hepcidin as a therapeutic tool to limit iron overload and improve anemia in β-thalassemic mice|journal=J Clin Invest|volume=120|issue=12|pages=4466–4477|year=2010|month=November|pmid=21099112|doi=10.1172/JCI41717|url=|issn=|pmc=2993583 }}</ref> The therapeutic potential for modulating hepcidin expression and the diagnostic potential for hepcidin measurements in clinical practice were recently addressed by Kroot et al.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kroot|first=JJ|coauthors=Tjalsma, H, Fleming, RE, Swinkels, DW|title=Hepcidin in human iron disorders: diagnostic implications.|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=2011 Dec|volume=57|issue=12|pages=1650–69|pmid=21989113}}</ref>
