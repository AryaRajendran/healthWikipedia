== Surgeon General of the United States ==
[[File:President Barack Obama with Surgeon General nominee Regina Benjamin 07-13-09.jpg|right|thumb|Benjamin accepting President [[Barack Obama]]'s nomination.]]

On July 13, 2009, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] announced the choice of Benjamin for the position of [[Surgeon General of the United States]]<ref>[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/07/the-doctor-is-finally-in-obama-to-name-regina-benjamin-for-surgeon-general.html The Doctor Is (Finally) In: Obama To Name Regina Benjamin]</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124749440449132729.html Alabama Doctor Tapped for Surgeon General]</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE56C3HI20090713 Obama picks Regina Benjamin as surgeon general]</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31929715/ns/health-health_care/page/2/ Obama on health care policy: ‘No free lunch’]</ref> and as a [[Vice admiral (United States)|Medical Director]] in the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|regular corps]] of the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]].<ref name="confirm">[http://senatus.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/senate-confirms-regina-benjamin-as-surgeon-general/ Senate Confirms Regina Benjamin as Surgeon General]</ref>  On October 7, 2009, Benjamin was unanimously approved by the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]].<ref>[http://www.wkrg.com/alabama/article/senate-committee-approves-dr.-regina-benjamin/420752/Oct-07-2009_12-52-pm/ Senate Committee Approves Dr. Regina Benjamin]</ref> Benjamin was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on October 29, 2009.<ref name="confirm"/>

Benjamin accepted the President's nomination, and made clear her dissatisfaction with the current [[Health care in the United States|health care system]], in terms of accessibility as well as cost.<ref name="benjaminbio"/> Also in accepting her nomination, Benjamin described her own hardships faced by disease and illness in her own family. She noted the deaths of her brother, who died of HIV, as well as her father, who died of [[high blood pressure]] and [[diabetes]], and her mother who died of lung cancer, all of which, she implied, were "preventable diseases."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/13/regina-benjamin-obamas-pi_n_230547.html Regina Benjamin, Obama's Pick For Surgeon General]</ref>

In January 2010, Benjamin released her first document, entitled "The Surgeon General’s Vision for a Healthy and Fit Nation."  In it she highlighted the alarming trend of overweight and obese Americans, and offered a blueprint for grassroots efforts to make changes that promote the health and wellness of families and communities.<ref>[http://surgeongeneral.gov/library/obesityvision/obesityvision2010.pdf Surgeongeneral.gov]</ref> Her work in this area has continued. One innovative program encouraged women of color to exercise more and not skip the gym for fear of "messing up their hair" gave $5,000 to the winner of a healthy hair and fitness competition. This was detailed in an [[NPR]] interview.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/2012/08/08/158419580/surgeon-general-dont-let-hair-get-in-the-way , Interview with NPR - August8, 2012]</ref> During the course of this interview several other programs were discussed, including the campaign against obesity, and the "Million Hearts" campaign to prevent one million heart attacks each year.

In September, 2012, Surgeon General Benjamin issued "The 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, a report from the U.S. Surgeon General and the Action Alliance". This report discussed 13 goals and 60 objectives for reducing suicides over the next 10 years. In 2001, Surgeon General David Satcher launched the first National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.<ref>[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/national-strategy-suicide-prevention/index.html , 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention - Goals and Objectives]</ref><ref>[http://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/advisories/1209102435.aspx , 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention]</ref>

New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman said that Benjamin, "like most of her predecessors," avoided controversy, and avoided criticizing industry. The 2010 report, he said, blames "the victims" for eating too much and not getting enough exercise, while ignoring the marketing of junk food, and the scientific evidence for the contribution of sugar-sweetened food to obesity.<ref>[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/our-m-i-a-surgeon-general/ Our M.I.A. Surgeon General], By MARK BITTMAN, New York Times, February 20, 2013</ref>

===Criticism===
Her political support for [[Abortion in the United States|abortion access]] had been cited as a source of controversy, since Benjamin is a Roman Catholic and the Catholic Church opposes such access. However, she has also received an award from the pope.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/1141814.html Obama's surgeon general pick: a Catholic who backs abortion rights]</ref> Benjamin also sits on the board of the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Health Association]]<ref>[http://www.chausa.org/Pub/MainNav/AboutCHA/Governance/CHABoard/ CHAUSA: The Catholic Health Association of the United States – CHA Board: Board of Trustees]</ref> and is active in her local church.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159707.php Picks For NIH Head, Surgeon General Side With Obama On Reproductive Issues, Despite Faith]</ref> Benjamin served on the board of trustees of the Catholic Health Association. She was endorsed by Lloyd Dean, the president of Catholic Healthcare West, the largest hospital system in California, who issued a statement saying he was "delighted" by her nomination.<ref>[http://www.prochoicecalifornia.org/media/news/20090714~3.shtml Obama's surgeon general pick: a Catholic who backs abortion rights] NARAL. July 14, 2009. Retrieved August 25, 2012.</ref>

During her confirmation process, critics also sought to make Benjamin's personal weight a source of controversy.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=8129947&page=1 Critics Slam Overweight Surgeon General Pick, Regina Benjamin]</ref><ref name="reginacia">[http://www.al.com/news/press-register/metro.ssf?/base/news/1254993360186020.xml&coll=3 Regina Benjamin once served as intern for CIA]</ref>

MacArthur Foundation]] that would have been worth $500,000 over the course of five years.<ref>[http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2009/07/13/obama-names-regina-benjamin-as-surgeon-general.html Obama Names Regina Benjamin as Surgeon General]</ref> However, as a federal employee, she had to stop accepting the MacArthur Fellows stipend when she accepted the position as Surgeon General.<ref name="benjinterview"/>
