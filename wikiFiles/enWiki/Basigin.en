'''Basigin''' (BSG) also known as '''extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer''' (EMMPRIN) or '''cluster of differentiation 147''' (CD147) is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''BSG'' [[gene]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kasinrerk W, Fiebiger E, Stefanová I, Baumruker T, Knapp W, Stockinger H |title=Human leukocyte activation antigen M6, a member of the Ig superfamily, is the species homologue of rat OX-47, mouse basigin, and chicken HT7 molecule |journal=J Immunol |volume=149 |issue=3 |pages=847–54 |year=1992 |pmid=1634773}}</ref><ref name = yurch>{{cite journal |author=Yurchenko V, Constant S, Bukrinsky M |title=Dealing with the family: CD147 interactions with cyclophilins |journal=Immunology |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=301–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16476049 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2567.2005.02316.x |pmc=1782239}}</ref><ref name = "Miyauchi_1992">{{cite journal  | author=Miyauchi T, Masuzawa Y, Muramatsu T |title=The basigin group of the immunoglobulin superfamily: complete conservation of a segment in and around transmembrane domains of human and mouse basigin and chicken HT7 antigen |journal=J.

== Function ==

Basigin is a member of the [[immunoglobulin superfamily]], with a structure related to the putative primordial form of the family. As members of the immunoglobulin superfamily play fundamental roles in intercellular recognition involved in various immunologic phenomena, differentiation, and development, basigin is thought also to play a role in intercellular recognition (Miyauchi et al., 1991; Kanekura et al., 1991).<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: BSG basigin (Ok blood group)| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=682| accessdate = }}</ref><ref name = "Kanekura_1991">{{cite journal  | author=Kanekura T, Chen X, Kanzaki T |title=Basigin (CD147) is expressed on melanoma cells and induces tumor cell invasion by stimulating production of matrix metalloproteinases by fibroblasts |journal=Int.

It has a variety of functions. In addition to its metalloproteinase-inducing ability, basigin also regulates several distinct functions, such as [[spermatogenesis]], expression of the [[monocarboxylate transporter]] and the responsiveness of [[lymphocyte]]s.<ref name = yurch/>
Basigin is a type I [[Integral membrane protein|integral membrane receptor]] that has many [[ligand]]s, including the [[cyclophilin]] (CyP) proteins Cyp-A and CyP-B and certain [[integrin]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yurchenko V, Zybarth G, O'Connor M, Dai W, Franchin G, Hao T, Guo H, Hung H, Toole B, Gallay P, Sherry B, Bukrinsky M |title=Active site residues of cyclophilin A are crucial for its signaling activity via CD147 |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=277 |issue=25 |pages=22959–65 |year=2002 |pmid=11943775 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M201593200}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yurchenko V, O'Connor M, Dai W, Guo H, Toole B, Sherry B, Bukrinsky M |title=CD147 is a signaling receptor for cyclophilin B |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume=288 |issue=4 |pages=786–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11688976 |doi=10.1006/bbrc.2001.5847}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Berditchevski F, Chang S, Bodorova J, Hemler M |title=Generation of monoclonal antibodies to integrin-associated proteins.

The human basigin protein contains 269 amino acids that form two heavily [[glycosylation|glycosylated]] [[immunoglobulin domain|C2 type immunoglobulin-like domains]] at the N-terminal extracellular portion. A second form of basigin has also been characterized that contains one additional immunoglobulin-like domain in its extracellular portion.<ref name = yurch/>

==Interactions==
Basigin has been shown to [[Protein-protein_interaction|interact]] with [[Ubiquitin C]].<ref name=pmid18689982>{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Wen-Juan |authorlink= |coauthors=Li Qing-Quan, Xu Jing-Da, Cao Xi-Xi, Li Hai-Xia, Tang Feng, Chen Qi, Yang Jin-Ming, Xu Zu-De, Liu Xiu-Ping |year=2008|month= |title=Interaction between CD147 and P-glycoprotein and their regulation by ubiquitination in breast cancer cells |journal=Chemotherapy |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=291–301 |publisher= |location = Switzerland| pmid = 18689982 |doi = 10.1159/000151225 | bibcode = | oclc =| id = | url = | language = | format = | accessdate = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}</ref>

Basigin has been shown to form a complex with [[monocarboxylate transporter]]s in the retina of the mouse. Basigin appears to be required for proper placement of MCTs in the membrane.  In the Basigin null mouse, the failure of MCTs to integrate with the membrane may be directly linked to a failure of nutrient transfer in the retinal pigmented epithelium (the lactates transported by MCTs 1, 3, and 4 are essential nutrients for the developing RPE), resulting in loss of sight in the null animal.<ref name=pmid12601063 >{{cite journal |last=Philp|first=W.J. |authorlink= |coauthors=J.D.

==Role In Malaria==

It has recently (November 2011) been found that Basigin is a receptor that is essential to erythrocyte invasion by most strains of ''Plasmodium falciparum'', the most virulent species of the [[plasmodium]] parasites that cause of human [[malaria]]. It is hoped that by developing antibodies to the parasite ligand for Basigin, Rh5, a better vaccine for malaria might be found.<ref name="pmid22080952">{{cite journal | author = Crosnier C, Bustamante LY, Bartholdson SJ, Bei AK, Theron M, Uchikawa M, Mboup S, Ndir O, Kwiatkowski DP, Duraisingh MT, Rayner JC, Wright GJ | title = Basigin is a receptor essential for erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Nature | volume = 480| issue = 7378| pages = 534–7| year = 2011 | month = November | pmid = 22080952 | doi = 10.1038/nature10606 | pmc=3245779}}</ref> Basigin is bound by the PfRh5 protein on the surface of the malaria parasite.
