'''Vasa praevia''' ('''vasa previa''' [[American English|AE]]) is an obstetric complication defined as "fetal vessels crossing or running in close proximity to the inner [[cervical os]]. These vessels course within the membranes (unsupported by the [[umbilical cord]] or [[placenta|placental tissue]]) and are at risk of rupture when the supporting membranes rupture."<ref>

==Etiology/Pathophysiology==
Vasa previa is present when fetal vessels traverse the fetal membranes over the internal cervical os. These vessels may be from either a [[Velamentous cord insertion|velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord]] or may be joining an accessory (succenturiate) placental lobe to the main disk of the placenta. If these fetal vessels rupture the bleeding is from the fetoplacental circulation, and fetal [[exsanguination]] will rapidly occur, leading to fetal death.

==Risk Factors==
Vasa previa is seen more commonly with velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, accessory placental lobes (succenturiate or bilobate placenta), multiple gestation, IVF pregnancy. In IVF pregnancies incidences as high as one in 300 have been reported.The reasons for this association are not clear, but disturbed orientation of the blastocyst at implantation, vanishing embryos and the increased frequency of placental morphological variations in in vitro fertilisation pregnancies have all been postulated <ref>http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG27PlacentaPraeviaJanuary2011.pdf</ref>

==Diagnosis==
* The classic triad of the vasa praevia is: membrane rupture, painless vaginal bleeding and fetal bradycardia.
* This is rarely confirmed before delivery but may be suspected when antenatal sono-gram with color-flow Doppler reveals a vessel crossing the membranes over the internal cervical os.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lijoi A, Brady J | title = Vasa previa diagnosis and management. | journal = J Am Board Fam Pract | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 543–8 | year = 2003| pmid = 14963081 | doi = 10.3122/jabfm.16.6.543}}''[http://www.jabfm.org/cgi/content/full/16/6/543 Full text]''</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee W, Lee V, Kirk J, Sloan C, Smith R, Comstock C | title = Vasa previa: prenatal diagnosis, natural evolution, and clinical outcome. | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 572–6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10725492 | doi = 10.1016/S0029-7844(99)00600-6}}</ref>
* The diagnosis is usually confirmed after delivery on examination of the placenta and fetal membranes{{citation-needed|date=October 2011}}.

==Treatment==
Treatment ''immediately'' with an emergency [[caesarean section|caesarean delivery]] is usually indicated.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bhide A, Thilaganathan B | title = Recent advances in the management of placenta previa. | journal = Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 447–51 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15534438 | doi = 10.1097/00001703-200412000-00002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Oyelese Y, Smulian J | title = Placenta previa, placenta accreta, and vasa previa. | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 107 | issue = 4 | pages = 927–41 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16582134 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000207559.15715.98}}</ref>
