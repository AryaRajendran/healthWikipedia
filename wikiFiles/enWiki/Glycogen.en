'''Glycogen'''  is a multibranched [[polysaccharide]] that serves as a form of energy storage in [[animal]]s<ref>{{cite book |title = Life |edition = 9th, International |last = Sadava et al |year = 2011 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = 9781429254311 |page = }}</ref> and [[fungi]]. In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the [[liver]] and the [[muscle]]s, and functions as the secondary long-term energy storage (with the primary energy stores being fats held in [[adipose tissue]]).

Glycogen is the analogue of [[starch]], a glucose polymer in [[plant]]s, and is sometimes referred to as ''animal starch'', having a similar structure to [[amylopectin]] but more extensively branched and compact than starch. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the [[cytosol]]/cytoplasm in many [[cell (biology)|cell]] types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose cycle]]. Glycogen forms an [[energy]] reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of [[triglycerides]] (lipids).

Polysaccharide represents the main storage form of glucose in the body. Found in the liver and muscles, muscle glycogen is converted into glucose by muscle cells, and liver glycogen converts to glucose for use throughout the body including the Central Nervous System.    

In the liver cells (hepatocyte)s, glycogen can compose up to eight percent of the fresh weight (100–120&nbsp;g in an adult) soon after a meal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink = | coauthors = Brad Williamson; Robin J.

==Structure==
[[Image:Glykogen.svg|thumb|right|360px|Schematic of glycogen structure]]
Glycogen is a branched [[biopolymer]] consisting of linear chains of [[glucose]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residue]]s with further chains branching off every ten glucoses or so. Glucoses are linked together linearly by α(1→4) [[glycosidic bond]]s from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains they are branching off from by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.<ref>{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg, Tymoczko & Stryer |year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = 1429203145 |page = 338}}</ref> 

Due to the way that glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein.<ref>{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg et al |year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = |page = 650}}</ref>

==Function==
===Liver===
As a meal containing [[carbohydrate]]s is eaten and [[digest]]ed, [[blood glucose]] levels rise, and the [[pancreas]] secretes [[insulin]]. Blood glucose from the [[portal vein]] enters [[liver]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] ([[hepatocyte]]s). [[Insulin]] acts on the [[hepatocytes]] to stimulate the action of several [[enzyme]]s, including [[glycogen synthase]]. [[Glucose]] [[molecules]] are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both [[insulin]] and [[glucose]] remain plentiful. In this [[postprandial]] or "fed" state, the [[liver]] takes in more [[glucose]] from the [[blood]] than it releases.

After a meal has been [[digestion|digested]] and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for [[Food energy|energy]], glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen will be the primary source of blood glucose to be used by the rest of the body for fuel.

[[Glucagon]] is another hormone produced by the pancreas, which in many respects serves as a counter-signal to insulin. In response to insulin level below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways.

===Muscle===
[[Skeletal muscle|Muscle cell]] glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally as well. Muscle cells lack the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], which is required to pass glucose into the blood, so the glycogen they store is destined for internal use and is not shared with other cells. (This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for the [[brain]] or muscles). Glycogen is also a suitable storage substance due to its insolubility in water, which means it does not affect the osmotistic levels and pressure of a cell.

==History==
Glycogen was discovered by [[Claude Bernard]]. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a "ferment" in the liver. By 1857 he described the isolation of a substance that he called "la matière glycogène", or "sugar-forming substance". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ({{chem|C|6|H|10|O|5}})<sub>n</sub> was established by [[August Kekulé|Kekule]] in 1858.<ref>{{cite journal |author=F. G. Young |title=Claude Bernard and the Discovery of Glycogen|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5033 (Jun. 22, 1957) |pages=1431–7 |year=1957 |jstor=25382898}}</ref>

==Metabolism==
===Synthesis===
{{Main|Glycogenesis}}

Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, [[endergonic]]. This means that glycogen synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]], which reacts with [[glucose-1-phosphate]], forming [[UDP-glucose]], in a reaction catalysed by [[UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase]]. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of [[UDP-glucose]] by the enzyme [[glycogen synthase]], which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (α1→4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can lengthen only an existing chain, the protein [[glycogenin]] is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching enzyme, '''amylo (α1→4) to (α1→6) transglycosylase''', catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule.  The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.

===Breakdown===
{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}
[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase2.png|thumb|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]
Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] by phosphoglucomutase. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the alpha(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:
*G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.
*G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.
*In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

==Clinical relevance==
===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===
The most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism as well.

In [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin level prevents the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.

Various [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.

===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===
Long-distance athletes such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without enough energy consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as "[[hitting the wall]]".

Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose per time (high [[glycemic Index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through training, the body can be conditioned to burn fat earlier, faster, and more efficiently{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming foods low on the [[glycemic Index]] for 12–18 hours before the event, the liver and muscles will store the resulting slow but steady stream of glucose as glycogen, instead of fat. This process is known as [[carbohydrate loading]].

When experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference, the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4-5hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first 3 strategies.

A study published in the  ''Journal of Applied Physiology'' (online May 8, 2008) suggests that, when athletes ingest both carbohydrate and [[caffeine]] following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen is replenished more rapidly.{{MEDRS|date=November 2012}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pedersen DJ, Lessard SJ, Coffey VG, ''et al.'' |title=High rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis after exhaustive exercise when carbohydrate is coingested with caffeine |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18467543 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01121.2007 |type=Original article }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://newswise.com/articles/view/542216/ |title=Post-exercise Caffeine Helps Muscles Refuel |publisher=American Physiological Society |agency=Newswise |accessdate=July 6, 2008 }}</ref>
