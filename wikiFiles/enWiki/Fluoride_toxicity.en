In high concentrations, soluble [[fluoride]] [[salts]] are [[toxic]] and skin or eye contact with high concentrations of many fluoride salts is dangerous.  Referring to a common salt of fluoride, [[sodium fluoride]] (NaF), the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10&nbsp;g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64&nbsp;mg/kg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).<ref>{{cite book | last = Gosselin | first = RE | coauthors = Smith RP, Hodge HC | authorlink = | title = Clinical toxicology of commercial products | publisher = Williams & Wilkins| location = Baltimore (MD) | year = 1984 | pages =III-185–93| isbn =0-683-03632-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Baselt | first = RC | coauthors = | authorlink = | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man | publisher = Biomedical Publications| location = Foster City (CA) | year = 2008 | pages =636–40| isbn =978-0-9626523-7-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = IPCS | first =  | coauthors = | authorlink = | title = Environmental health criteria 227 (Fluoride) | publisher = International Programme on Chemical Safety, World Health Organization| location = Geneva | year = 2002 | pages =100| isbn =92-4-157227-2}}</ref> Ingestion of fluoride can produce gastrointestinal discomfort at doses at least 15 to 20 times lower (0.2–0.3&nbsp;mg/kg) than lethal doses.<ref name=Gessner94>{{cite journal | title = Acute fluoride poisoning from a public water system | author = Bradford D.

== Acute ==
=== Mechanism ===
Like most soluble materials, fluoride compounds are readily absorbed by the stomach and intestines, and [[excretion|excreted]] through the urine. [[Urinalysis|Urine tests]] have been used to ascertain rates of excretion in order to set upper limits in exposure to fluoride compounds and associated detrimental health effects.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Baez, Ramon J.; Baez, Martha X.; Marthaler, Thomas M. | title = Urinary fluoride excretion by children 4–6 years old in a south Texas community | journal = Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | year = 2000 | pages = 242–248 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/paho/pajph/2000/00000007/00000004/art00005}}</ref> Ingested fluoride initially acts locally on the intestinal mucosa, where it forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach.

Historically, most cases of acute fluoride toxicity have followed accidental ingestion of sodium fluoride based insecticides or rodenticides.<ref name=Nochimson>Nochimson G. (2008).

Malfunction of water fluoridation equipment has happened several times, including a notable incident in Alaska.<ref name=Gessner94/>

=== Organofluorine compounds ===
[[Organofluorine compound]]s only rarely release F<sup>−</sup> under biological conditions and thus are rarely sources of fluoride poisoning.  In order for fluoride poisoning to occur, a [[chemical compound|compound]] must release fluoride (F<sup>−</sup>) ions.  Whereas most [[organofluorine compound]]s may not release F<sup>−</sup> because of the strength of the [[carbon–fluorine bond]] and its tendency to strengthen as more [[fluorine]] atoms are added to a [[carbon]], some compounds do, such as [[methoxyflurane]]. The fluorine atom is pervasive in drugs, e.g. [[fluoxetine|Prozac]], and many other substances such as [[freon]], [[Teflon]], and [[blood serum]] ([[PFOS]], [[PFOA]], and [[PFNA]]).

=== Fluoride in toothpaste ===
Children may experience gastrointestinal distress upon ingesting sufficient amounts of flavored toothpaste. Between 1990 and 1994, over 628 people, mostly children, were treated after ingesting too much fluoride from their toothpaste. Gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be the most common problem reported.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Acute Fluoride Toxicity from Ingesting Home-use Dental Products in Children, Birth to 6 Years of Age | author = Jay D.

In India an estimated 60 million people have been poisoned by well water contaminated by excessive fluoride, which is dissolved from the granite rocks. The effects are particularly evident in the bone deformations of children.  Similar or larger problems are anticipated in other countries including China, Uzbekistan, and Ethiopia.<ref name="Pearce"/>

The only generally accepted adverse effect of fluoride at levels used for [[water fluoridation]] is [[dental fluorosis]], which can alter the appearance of children's teeth during [[tooth development]]; this is mostly mild and usually only an aesthetic concern. Compared to unfluoridated water, fluoridation to 1&nbsp;mg/L is estimated to cause fluorosis in one of every 6 people (range 4–21), and to cause fluorosis of aesthetic concern in one of every 22 people (range 13.6–∞). Here, "aesthetic concern" is a term used in a standardized scale based on what adolescents would find unacceptable, as measured by a 1996 study of British 14-year-olds.<ref name=York>{{cite journal |author= McDonagh MS, Whiting PF, Wilson PM ''et al.'' |title= Systematic review of water fluoridation |journal=BMJ  |volume=321 |issue=7265 |pages=855–9 |year=2000 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7265.855 |pmid=11021861 |pmc=27492 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/321/7265/855.pdf |format=PDF}} The full report is at: {{cite journal |author= McDonagh MS, Whiting PF, Bradley M ''et al.'' |title= A systematic review of water fluoridation |publisher= NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination |year=2000 |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/pdf/fluorid.pdf |format=PDF |version= CRD Report 18}}</ref>

Consumption of fluoride at levels beyond those used in fluoridated water for a long period of time causes [[skeletal fluorosis]]. In some areas, particularly the Asian subcontinent, skeletal fluorosis is endemic. It is known to cause irritable-bowel symptoms and joint pain. Early stages are not clinically obvious, and may be misdiagnosed as (seronegative) [[rheumatoid arthritis]] or [[ankylosing spondylitis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta R, Kumar AN, Bandhu S, Gupta S |title=Skeletal fluorosis mimicking seronegative arthritis |journal=Scand.

Other adverse effects may be possible at fluoride intake levels above the recommended dosage, and defluoridation is recommended in these cases. In 1986, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) established a [[maximum contaminant level]] (MCL)  for fluoride at a concentration of 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L), which is the legal limit of fluoride allowed in the water. In 1993, a review by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] conducted at the behest of EPA concluded that the 4&nbsp;mg/L MCL was appropriate.<ref>[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20003HN4.txt Fluoride in Drinking Water], EPA Fact Sheet, December 1993</ref> However, in 2006, a 12-person committee of the [[United States National Research Council|US National Research Council]] (NRC) reviewed the health risks associated with fluoride consumption<ref name=NRC2006>{{cite book |title= Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA's Standards |author= National Research Council |location= Washington, DC |publisher= National Academies Press |isbn=0-309-10128-X |year=2006 |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11571#toc |laysummary=http://dels.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/fluoride_brief_final.pdf |laysource=NRC |laydate=September 24, 2008}}. See also [http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/safety/nas.htm CDC's statement on this report].</ref> and came to the differing conclusion that the MCL should be lowered. In response to these studies, the EPA has made no change to the MCL.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs.htm EPA: Community Water Fluoridation, FAQ]</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/standard/setting.html EPA: Setting Standards for Safe Drinking Water]</ref> 
U.S. government officials lowered recommended limits for fluoride in water on Friday Jan. 7, 2011, saying some children may be getting tooth damage from too much.  The Health and Human Services Department lowered its recommended levels to 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water – the lower limit of the current recommended range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams. see:http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/08/us-usa-fluoride-idUSTRE7064CM20110108

Excess fluoride consumption has been studied as a factor in the following:

*A weakening of [[bone]]s, leading to an increase in hip and wrist fracture. At the level used in fluoridated water, decreased fractures are expected,<ref name=York/> but the U.S. National Research Council found the overall evidence "suggestive but inadequate for drawing firm conclusions about the risk or safety of exposures at [2&nbsp;mg/L]", but states that fractures do seem to increase as fluoride is increased from 1&nbsp;mg/L to 4&nbsp;mg/L, suggesting a "continuous exposure-effect" [[dose-response relationship]] at these levels.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|170}}

*Adverse effects on the kidney. Within the recommended dose, no effects are expected, but chronic ingestion in excess of 12&nbsp;mg/day are expected to cause adverse effects, and an intake that high is possible when fluoride levels are around 4&nbsp;mg/L.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|281}} Those with impaired kidney function are more susceptible to adverse effects.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|292}}
<!-- if there is little or inconsistent research, we do NOT discuss otherwise we are doing [[WP:OR]]*Little research has been done on possible [[liver]] damage, although some studies suggest negative effects at chronic ingestion of 23&nbsp;mg/day.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|292}}

*[[Chromosomal]] damage and interference with [[DNA]] repair.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|304}} Overall, the literature from in vitro and rodent studies does not indicate [[genotoxicity]], but the in vivo human studies are inconsistent.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|316}}-->

*Four epidemiological studies have noted a correlation between increased fluoride and low IQ.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|205–223}} The most rigorous of these compared an area with mean water concentration of 0.36 ± 0.15&nbsp;mg/L (range 0.18–0.76&nbsp;mg/L) to an area with 2.47 ± 0.79&nbsp;mg/L (range 0.57–4.50&nbsp;mg/L). Most of these studies did not publish important details, making them difficult to evaluate. If these correlations are caused by fluoride, the mechanism is not known, but the National Research Council speculates that effects on the thyroid could lead to poor test results.<ref name=NRC2006/>{{rp|208}} Two Chinese meta-analyses which included the previously mentioned studies have also noted this correlation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liu M, Qian C |title=[Effect of endemic fluorosis on children's intelligence development: a Meta analysis.] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=723–5 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19102839 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tang QQ, Du J, Ma HH, Jiang SJ, Zhou XJ |title=Fluoride and children's intelligence: a meta-analysis |journal=Biol Trace Elem Res |volume=126 |issue=1–3 |pages=115–20 |year=2008 |pmid=18695947 |doi=10.1007/s12011-008-8204-x |url=}}</ref> The high-fluoride areas studied had fluoride levels above those used in water fluoridation.
