A '''Krukenberg tumor''' refers to a [[malignancy]] in the ovary that [[metastasis|metastasized]] from a primary site, classically the gastrointestinal tract, although it can arise in other tissues such as the breast.<ref name=Ackerman04>{{cite book |author=Ackerman, Lauren Vedder; Rosai, Juan |title=Rosai and Ackerman's surgical pathology |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2004 |page=1708 |isbn=0-323-01342-2 |volume=2}}</ref> Gastric adenocarcinoma, especially at the [[pylorus]], is the most common source.<ref name="Al-Agha2006">{{cite pmid|17076540}}</ref> Krukenberg tumors are often (over 80%)<ref name="Al-Agha2006" /> found in both ovaries, consistent with its metastatic nature.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/>

==Historical==
Krukenberg tumors are named after [[Friedrich Ernst Krukenberg]] (1871â€“1946),<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|620|Friedrich Ernst Krukenberg}}</ref>  who reported what he thought was a new type of primary ovarian malignancy in 1896;  six years later these were shown to be of metastatic gastrointestinal tract origin.<ref name="Young2006">{{cite pmid|16998315}}</ref> However, Paget had described the process in 1854.<ref name="Young2006"/>

==Etiology and incidence==
Krukenberg tumors can be seen in all age groups, with an average age of 45 years.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/> In most countries, cancer that has [[metastasis|metastasized]] to the ovary accounts for only about 1 to 2% of [[ovarian cancer]];<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/> in the remainder, the ovary itself is the primary cancer site. However, in Japan they represent a much higher percentage of malignancies in the ovary (almost 20%) due to the increased prevalence of gastric cancer.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/>

Krukenberg tumors account for about 15% of metastatic cancers that initially appear to have arisen in the ovary, and as such is less common than metastasis arising from ovarian epithelial and germ-cell tumors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In people who have had nongynecologic malignancy, approximately 20% of [[Adnexa of uterus|adnexa]]l masses are malignant, and 60% of these are Krukenberg tumors.<ref name="Juretzka2006">{{cite pmid|16360202}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Krukenberg tumors often come to the attention when they cause abdominal or pelvic pain, bloating, [[ascites]], or pain during sexual intercourse. Krukenberg tumors can occasionally provoke a reaction of the ovarian stroma which leads to hormone production, that results in vaginal bleeding, a change in menstrual habits, or [[hirsutism]],<ref name="Kiyokawa2006"/> or occasionally [[virilization]]<ref name="Papakonstantinou2011">{{cite pmid|21797128}}</ref> as a main symptom. 

All these symptoms are non-specific and can also arise with a range of problems other than cancer, and a diagnosis can only be made following confirmatory investigations such as [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans, [[laparotomy]] and/or a [[biopsy]] of the ovary.

==Pathogenesis==
There has been debate over the exact mechanism of metastasis of the tumor cells from the stomach, appendix or colon to the ovaries. Classically it was thought that direct seeding across the abdominal cavity accounted for the spread of this tumor, but spread by way of the [[lymphatic]] is considered more likely.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/> The average age of diagnosis of Krukenberg tumors may partly relate to the relatively increased vascularity of the ovaries.<ref name="Young2006"/>

Microscopically, Krukenberg tumors are often characterized by [[mucin]]-secreting [[signet-ring cell]]s in the tissue of the ovary;<ref name="Young2006"/> when the primary tumor is discovered, the same signet-ring cells are typically found. However, other microscopic features can predominate.<ref name="Young2006"/><ref name="Kiyokawa2006">{{cite pmid|16538048}}</ref> Krukenberg tumors are most commonly metastases from [[gastric cancer]], particularly [[adenocarcinoma]], or [[breast cancer]]<ref name=Ackerman04/> particularly [[Invasive lobular carcinoma|invasive lobular breast carcinoma]],<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/> but they can arise in the appendix, colon, small intestine, rectum, gallbladder, and urinary bladder<ref name="Kiyokawa2006"/> or gallbladder, biliary tract, pancreas, [[ampulla of Vater]] or uterine cervix.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/>

[[Immunohistochemistry]] may help in diagnosing Krukenberg tumors from primary ovarian neoplasms<ref name="Young2006"/> but needs to be applied with discretion.<ref name="Young2007">{{cite pmid|17452813}}</ref> For example, tumors that are immunoreactive to [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|CEA]] or [[keratin 20|cytokeratin 20]] (CK20) and negative for [[keratin 7|cytokeratin 7]] (CK7) may be more likely to be of colorectal origin.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/>

==Treatment and prognosis==
Since Krukenberg tumors are secondary (metastatic), management might logically be driven by identifying and treating the primary cancer. The optimal treatment of Krukenberg tumors is unclear.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/> The role of surgical resection has not been adequately addressed<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/> but if metastasis is limited to the ovaries, surgery may improve survival.<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/><ref name="Cheong2004">{{cite pmid|15297191}}</ref><ref name="Kim2010">{{cite pmid|20018420}}</ref> The role of [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiotherapy]] is uncertain<ref name="Al-Agha2006"/> but may be sometimes be beneficial.<ref name="Kim2010"/>
