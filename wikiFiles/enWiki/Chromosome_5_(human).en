'''Chromosome 5''' is one of the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in [[human]]s. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 5 spans about 181 million [[base pair]]s (the building blocks of [[DNA]]) and represents almost 6% of the total DNA in [[cell (biology)|cells]]. '''Chromosome 5''' is one of the largest human chromosomes, yet has one of the lowest [[gene]] densities.   This is partially explained by numerous gene-poor regions that display a remarkable degree of [[Noncoding DNA|non-coding]] and [[Synteny|syntenic]] conservation with non-mammalian [[vertebrate]]s, suggesting they are functionally constrained.<ref>http://genome.jgi-psf.org/chr5/chr5.home.html</ref>

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 5 likely contains between 900 and 1,300 genes.

Because chromosome 5 is responsible for many forms of growth and development (cell divisions) changes may cause cancers. One example would be [[AML]]. <ref>http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/5</ref>

==Chromosomal conditions==
The following conditions are caused by changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 5:

* [[Cri-du-chat syndrome]] is caused by a deletion of the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 5. This chromosomal change is written as 5p-. The signs and symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes in this region. Researchers have not identified all of these genes or determined how their loss leads to the features of the disorder. They have discovered, however, that a larger deletion tends to result in more severe mental retardation and developmental delays in people with cri-du-chat syndrome.

:Researchers have defined narrow regions of the short arm of chromosome 5 that are associated with particular features of cri-du-chat syndrome. A specific region designated 5p15.3 is associated with a cat-like cry, and a nearby region called 5p15.2 is associated with mental retardation, small head (microcephaly), and distinctive facial features.

*[[Familial Adenomatous Polyposis]] is caused by a deletion of the [[Adenomatosis polyposis coli|APC]] tumor suppressor gene on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5. This chromosomal change results in thousands of colonic polyps which gives the patient a 100% risk of colon cancer if total colectomy is not done. 

*[[Chromosome 5q deletion syndrome]] is caused by the deletion of the q arm (long arm) of chromosome 5. This deletion has been linked to several blood related disorders including [[Myelodysplastic syndrome]] and [[erythroblastopenia]]. This is a different condition then Cri-du-chat which was mentioned above. 

* Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 5 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other medical problems. Changes to chromosome 5 include an extra segment of the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 5p or 5q), a missing segment of the long arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 5q), and a circular structure called [[ring chromosome]] 5. A ring chromosome occurs when both ends of a broken chromosome are reunited.
