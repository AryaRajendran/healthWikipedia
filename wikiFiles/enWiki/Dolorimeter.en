A '''dolorimeter''' is an instrument used to measure [[pain threshold]] and [[pain tolerance]]. Dolorimetry has been defined as "the measurement of [[Pain threshold|pain sensitivity]] or pain intensity."<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dolorimetry Stedman's Medical Dictionary 2004 Houghton Mifflin Company]</ref> There are several kinds of dolorimeter that have been developed. Dolorimeters apply steady pressure, heat, or electrical stimulation to some area, or move a joint or other body part and determine what level of heat or pressure or electric current or amount of movement produces a sensation of [[pain]]. Sometimes the pressure is applied using a blunt object, or by locally increasing the air pressure on some area of the body, and sometimes by pressing a sharp instrument against the body.

==History==
In 1940, [[James D. Hardy]], [[Harold G. Wolff]] and [[Helen Goodell]] of  [[Cornell University]] introduced the first dolorimeter as a method for evaluating the effectiveness of analgesic medications.<ref>''Pain Sensations and Reactions'', J. D. Hardy, H. G. Wolff, H. Goodel, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 1952.</ref> They did their work at [[New York Hospital]]. They focused the light of a 100 watt projection lamp with a lens on an area of skin that had been blackened. They found that most people expressed a pain sensation when the skin temperature reached 113 °F (45 °C). They also found that after the skin temperature reached 152 °F (67 °C), the pain sensations did not intensify even if the heat was increased. They developed a pain scale, called the "Hardy-Wolff-Goodell" scale, with 10 gradations, or 10 levels. They assigned the name of "dols" to these levels.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867039,00.html? ''The Problem of Pain''], ''Time'' magazine, July 30, 1956.</ref><ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9556(196806)81%3A2%3C147%3ATIPTDS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23 ''Thermally Induced Pain, the Dol Scale, and the Psychophysical Power Law''], Eleanor R.

Marks, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 81, No. 2 (Jun., 1968), pp. 147-164 {{doi|10.2307/1421259}}</ref> Unfortunately, other researchers were not able to reproduce the results of Hardy, Wolff and Goodell and the device and the approach was abandoned.<ref>[http://www.anes.uab.edu/aneshist/AHA2005Tousignant.htm ''Displacing the Dolorimeter: The Fate of a Pain Measuring Instrument in the Era of Therapeutic Reform, U. S. 1940s-50s''], Noémi Tousignant, University of Alabama at Birmingham,  Department of Anesthesiology.</ref> [[Harvard Medical School]] Professor and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] [[Anaesthetist]] [[Henry K. Beecher]] (1957) expressed skepticism about this method of measuring pain.<ref>[http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/59 ''The Measurement of Pain: Prototype for the Quantitative Study of Subjective Responses''],  [[Henry K. Beecher]], [[Pharmacological Reviews]]. 9:59-209</ref>

In 1945, ''[[Time_(magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that Cleveland's Dr. Lorand Julius Bela Gluzek had developed a dolorimeter that measured pain in grams.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,791833,00.html Ouch!], ''Time'', Monday, Jan. 01, 1945.</ref><ref>GLUZEK, L. J. B. "Dolorimetry in medical practice: the quantitative measure 
of deep sensibility and of pain". Med. rec., N. Y., 1944, 157, 292-294.</ref> Dr. Gluzek claimed that his dolorimeter was 97% accurate.

==Palpometer==
A dolorimeter known as the ''Sonic Palpometer'' was developed at the [[University of Victoria]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Patents have been applied for worldwide.<ref>[http://www.engr.uvic.ca/~art/dolo.html University of Victoria Palpometer site]</ref> The Sonic Palpometer uses ultrasound and computer technology to automate the physician's technique of [[palpation]] to determine sensitivity of some part of the patient's body. 

The related pressure controlled palpometer (PCP) uses a pressure-sensitive piece of plastic film to determine how much pressure is being applied in palpation. This technique appears to be more reliable than unaided palpation.<ref>L Bendtsen, R Jensen, NK Jensen, J Olesen (1995), [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1468-2982.1995.015003205.x?cookieSet=1&journalCode=cha ''Pressure-controlled palpation: a new technique which increases the reliability of manual palpation''], Cephalalgia 15 (3), 205–210. {{doi|10.1046/j.1468-2982.1995.015003205.x}}</ref>

==Algorimeter and other methods==
===Techniques using lasers===
Svensson et al. (1997) describe the use of a CO<sub>2</sub> laser or a contact thermode to heat the skin and elicit a pain response.<ref>[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/link.asp?id=ca8a32y53qaxpqm2 ''Comparative psychophysical characteristics of cutaneous CO2 laser and contact heat stimulation''], Peter Svensson, BarryRosenberg, Ahmad Beydoun, Thomas J. Morrow and Kenneth L. Casey, Somatosensory & Motor Research,  Taylor & Francis , Volume 14, Number 2 / April 1, 1997, Pages 113 - 118, {{doi|10.1080/08990229771114}}</ref> 

A laser-based dolorimeter called a ''Dolorimeter Analgesia meter'' is marketed by IITC Life Sciences.

===Techniques using heat lamps===
Another pain measurement device uses  heat from a 500 watt [[Incandescent light bulb|lamp]] which is delivered to a small area of [[skin]]. 

===Other dolorimeters===
* Björnström's algesimeter measures sensitivity of the skin to pain.
* Boas' algesimeter measures sensitivity over the [[epigastrium]]

Other terms for similar instruments include ''algesiometer'', ''algesichronometer'' (which also takes time into consideration), ''analgesia meter'', ''algometer'', ''algonometer'', ''prick-algesimeter'', ''pressure-algometer''.

==Dolorimetry for animals==
{{Main|Animal testing#Pain and suffering}}
Dolorimetry in animals involves application of pain to various body parts. It is occasionally used as a diagnostic tool, and routinely used in basic pain research and in the testing of [[analgetics]]. 

===Tail===
*Tail-withdrawal tests
*Tail-pinch tests
*[[Tail flick test]] 

===Paw===
*[[Randall-Selitto test]] (paw pressure test)
*[[Hot plate test]]
