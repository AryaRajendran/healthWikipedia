==Symptoms and signs==
Individuals with GEFS+ present with a range of [[Seizure types|epilepsy phenotypes]]. These include febrile seizures that end by age 6 (FS), such seizures extending beyond age 6 that may include afebrile [[tonic-clonic seizure|tonic-clonic]], [[myoclonic seizure|myoclonic]], [[Absence seizure|absence]], [[atonic seizure]]s and [[myoclonic-astatic epilepsy]]. Individuals may also present with SMEI, which is characterized by generally tonic-clonic seizures, impaired [[psychomotor]] development, [[myoclonic seizures]], [[ataxia]], and poor response to many epileptic drugs.<ref name="Scheffer_1997"/><ref name="Rhodes_2005">{{cite journal | author = Rhodes T, Vanoye C, Ohmori I, Ogiwara I, Yamakawa K, George A | title = Sodium channel dysfunction in intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic–clonic seizures | journal = J Physiol | volume = 569 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 433–45 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16210358 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2005.094326 | pmc = 1464244}}</ref>

{{Empty section|date=February 2013}}

==Pathophysiology==

===Type 1===
[[Image:Sodium channel beta GEFS plus.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 1.''' Schematic structure of SCN1B with GEFS+ type 1 mutations shown in red. The single red spot is the C121W mutant at the disulfide bond (black) and the stretch of red the I70_E74del mutation.]]
GEFS+ type 1 is a subtype of GEFS+ in which there are mutations in SCN1B, a gene encoding a [[sodium channel]] β subunit. The β subunit is required for proper channel inactivation. There are two known mutations in SCN1B that lead to GEFS+ (Figure 1). The first and best characterized of these mutations is C121W. This mutation alters a [[cysteine]] involved in a [[disulfide bond]] in the extracellular N-terminus of the protein. This extracellular region is similar to the cell adhesion molecule contactin and other [[cell adhesion molecule]]s. It is believed that the disulfide bond disrupted by the C121W mutation is required for the proper folding of this N-terminus motif. Coexpression of SCN1B with sodium channel α subunits in [[oocyte]]s and other cells results in channels that inactivate more slowly. Expression of C121W mutant along with wild-type α subunits produces current indistinguishable from that through α subunits alone.<ref name="Wallace_1998"/><ref name="Tammaro_2002">{{cite journal | author = Tammaro P, Conti F, Moran O | title = Modulation of sodium current in mammalian cells by an epilepsy-correlated beta 1-subunit mutation | journal = Biochem Biophys Res Commun | volume = 291 | issue = 4 | pages = 1095–101 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11866477 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.2002.6570}}</ref> Further investigation of this mutation has indicated that it results in decreased frequency dependent rundown and, thus, likely hyperexcitability when compared to cells expressing the wild-type subunit. Interestingly, this mutation also disrupts the subunit's ability to induce cellular aggregation. The importance of this last fact is unclear, though it is presumed that proper channel aggregation within cells and cell-cell contact are required for normal neuronal function.<ref name="Meadows_2002">{{cite journal | author = Meadows L, Malhotra J, Loukas A, Thyagarajan V, Kazen-Gillespie K, Koopman M, Kriegler S, Isom L, Ragsdale D | title = Functional and biochemical analysis of a sodium channel beta1 subunit mutation responsible for generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus type 1 | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 22 | issue = 24 | pages = 10699–709 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12486163}}</ref><ref name="Lucas_2005">{{cite journal | author = Lucas P, Meadows L, Nicholls J, Ragsdale D | title = An epilepsy mutation in the beta1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel results in reduced channel sensitivity to phenytoin | journal = Epilepsy Res | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15922564 | doi = 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2005.03.003}}</ref>

A second mutation has been found in one kindred with GEFS+ type 1. This mutation is in a splice acceptor site of [[exon]] 3. The loss of this acceptor site reveals a downstream cryptic acceptor site and a protein missing 5 amino acids in the N-terminus (I70_E74del). This mutation has not been further characterized.<ref name="Audenaert_2003">{{cite journal | author = Audenaert D, Claes L, Ceulemans B, Löfgren A, Van Broeckhoven C, De Jonghe P | title = A deletion in SCN1B is associated with febrile seizures and early-onset absence epilepsy | journal = Neurology | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 854–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14504340}}</ref>

===Type 2===
A second subtype of GEFS+, type 2, is the result of mutations in SCN1A, a gene encoding a sodium channel α subunit. There are currently almost 90 known mutations in the SCN1A gene throughout the entirety of the channel (see table 1). These mutations result in almost any imaginable mutation type in the gene, short of duplications. The results of these mutations are highly variable, some producing functional channels while others result in non-functional channels. Some functional channels result in membrane hyperexcitability while others result in hypoexcitability. Most of the functional mutant channels result in hyperexcitability due to decreased frequency dependent rundown. An example of this is the D188V mutation. A 10&nbsp;Hz stimulation of wild-type channels causes current to decrease to approximately 70% of maximum whereas the same stimulation of mutant channels results in rundown to 90% of maximum. This is causes by an expedited recovery from inactivation for mutant channels versus wild-type. The D188V mutant, for example, recovers to 90% maximal current in 200ms while wild-type channels are unable to recover to this degree in >1000ms.<ref name="Cossette_2003">{{cite journal | author = Cossette P, Loukas A, Lafrenière R, Rochefort D, Harvey-Girard E, Ragsdale D, Dunn R, Rouleau G | title = Functional characterization of the D188V mutation in neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel causing generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS) | journal = Epilepsy Res | volume = 53 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 107–17 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12576172 | doi = 10.1016/S0920-1211(02)00259-0}}</ref> Some other functional mutations that lead to hyperexcitability due so by other means, such as decreasing the rate of entrance into the slow inactivated state.

Some of the other functional mutations are believed to result in hypoexcitability. The R859C mutation, for example, has a more depolarized voltage dependence of activation, meaning that the membrane must be more depolarized for the channel to open. This mutant also recovers more slowly from inactivation.<ref name="Barela_2006">{{cite journal | author = Barela A, Waddy S, Lickfett J, Hunter J, Anido A, Helmers S, Goldin A, Escayg A | title = An epilepsy mutation in the sodium channel SCN1A that decreases channel excitability | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 2714–23 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16525050 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2977-05.2006}}</ref> The nonfunctional channels are believed to produce similar changes in cell excitability. Likewise, many of the [[nonsense mutation]]s likely result in nonfunctional channels and hypoexcitability, though this has yet to be tested. It is also unclear how this membrane hypoexcitability leads to the GEFS+ phenotype.

===Type 3===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:GABRG2 GEFS plus.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 2.''' Schematic structure of GABRG2 with the GEFS+ type 3 mutations noted in red.]] -->
Patients with GEFS+ type 3 have mutations in the GABRG2 gene, which encodes the [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] γ2 subunit (figure 2). The first mutation discovered in GABRG2 was K289M, in the extracellular region linking membrane-spanning domains M2 and M3. Oocytes injected with α1, β2, and γ2 subunits produce large GABA inducible currents whereas those injected with K289M mutant instead of wild-type subunits produce currents much smaller (about 10% of wild-type). This abnormal current is not the result of non-incorporation of mutant subunits since mutant containing receptors are still sensitive to [[benzodiazepine]]s, a property for which functional γ subunits are required. Because of these results, it is believed that the GEFS+ phenotype in these individuals is a result of hyperexcitability.<ref name="Baulac_2001">{{cite journal | author = Baulac S, Huberfeld G, Gourfinkel-An I, Mitropoulou G, Beranger A, Prud'homme J, Baulac M, Brice A, Bruzzone R, LeGuern E | title = First genetic evidence of GABA(A) receptor dysfunction in epilepsy: a mutation in the gamma2-subunit gene | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11326274 | doi = 10.1038/88254}}</ref>

Concurrent with the previous mutation, a second group found a second mutation in GABRG2 associated with GEFS+. This mutation, R43Q, is located in the one of two benzodiazepine binding-sites located in the extracellular N-terminus. Benzodiazepines, such as [[Diazepam]], potentiate [[GABA]] induced current. This potentiation is abolished in cells expressing the R43Q mutant subunit instead of the wild-type γ subunit. This mutation does not affect the subunit's ability to coassemble into function receptors as it still confers resistance to GABA current blockade by [[zinc]]. As with the previous mutation, this mutation is expected to result in neuronal hyperexcitability.<ref name="Wallace_2001b">{{cite journal | author = Wallace R, Marini C, Petrou S, Harkin L, Bowser D, Panchal R, Williams D, Sutherland G, Mulley J, Scheffer I, Berkovic S | title = Mutant GABA(A) receptor gamma2-subunit in childhood absence epilepsy and febrile seizures | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–52 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11326275 | doi = 10.1038/88259}}</ref><ref name="Marini_2003">{{cite journal | author = Marini C, Harkin L, Wallace R, Mulley J, Scheffer I, Berkovic S | title = Childhood absence epilepsy and febrile seizures: a family with a GABA(A) receptor mutation | journal = Brain | volume = 126 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 230–40 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12477709 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awg018}}</ref>

The final known GEFS+ type 3 mutation is a [[nonsense mutation]], Q351X, located in the intracellular  region linking the third and fourth membrane spanning segments. When this mutant subunit is expressed in cells with wild-type α and β subunits it produces non-functional receptors. Since wild-type α and β subunits expressed alone are able to produce GABA inducible current this indicates that the mutation either prevents both coassembly of the mutant and wild-type subunits but also coassembly of the wild-type α and β subunits or prevents proper trafficking of the formed receptor to the membrane. Fusion of GFP onto this mutated subunit has indicated that it is localized to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] instead of the [[cell membrane]]. As with other known GEFS+ type 3 mutation, Q351X likely results in neuronal hyperexcitability.<ref name="Harkin_2002">{{cite journal | author = Harkin L, Bowser D, Dibbens L, Singh R, Phillips F, Wallace R, Richards M, Williams D, Mulley J, Berkovic S, Scheffer I, Petrou S | title = Truncation of the GABAA-Receptor γ2 Subunit in a Family with Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 530–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11748509 | doi = 10.1086/338710 | pmc = 384926}}</ref>

===SCN2A mutations===
[[Image:SCN2A GEFS plus.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 3.''' Schematic structure of SCN2A with GEFS+ associated mutation positions indicated by red dots.]]
The final type of GEFS+ is caused by mutations in the SCN2A gene, which encodes a [[sodium channel]] α subunit. The first associated mutation in this gene is R187W, located on the intracellular region linking membrane spanning units two and three in the first domain (D1S2-S3, figure 3). Patients with this mutation have both febrile and afebrile seizures. [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] examination of this mutant revealed that it increases the time constant for inactivation, presumably increasing sodium current and leading to hyperexcitability. However, this mutation also yields channels that inactivate at more hyperpolarized potentials relative to wild-type channels, indicative of hypoexcitability. Whether the end result on membrane excitability of this mutation is hyperexcitability or hypoexcitability is, as yet, unclear.<ref name="Ito_2006"/><ref name="Sugawara_2001">{{cite journal | author = Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala K, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel αII subunit gene Nav1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6384–9 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11371648 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmc = 33477}}</ref>

The second known mutation in SCN2A associated with GEFS+ is R102X. This mutation is located in the intracellular N-terminus (figure 3) and results in SMEI in patients. The result of this mutation is completely non-functional channels and membrane hypoexcitability. Interestingly, the truncated mutant protein also seems to cause wild-type channels to inactivate at more hyperpolarized potentials, indicating that it also acts in a [[dominant negative]] manner.<ref name="Kamiya_2004">{{cite journal | author = Kamiya K, Kaneda M, Sugawara T, Mazaki E, Okamura N, Montal M, Makita N, Tanaka M, Fukushima K, Fujiwara T, Inoue Y, Yamakawa K | title = A nonsense mutation of the sodium channel gene SCN2A in a patient with intractable epilepsy and mental decline | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 24 | issue = 11 | pages = 2690–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15028761 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3089-03.2004}}</ref>

==Treatment/Management==
Children and Adults with Dravet syndrome experience multiple seizure types that are resistant to most anti-epileptic medications. Currently, the evidence supports the use of “rational polytherapy” which consists of a step-wise introduction of medications that have been shown to improve seizure control in patients with Dravet syndrome until the patient either responds favorably or experiences unacceptable side effects. It must be emphasized that significant differences exist between countries with regard to drug dose preferences and availability of anti-epileptic medications.

The following medications have been shown to benefit patients with Dravet syndrome:<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&part=gefs</ref>
* [[divalproex]] sodium and derivatives (Depakote, Depakene,Epilim, Epival, Micropakine)
* [[topiramate]] (Topamax)
* [[stiripentol]] (Diacomit)
* [[clobazam]] (Frisium, Urbanyl)
* [[clonazepam]] (Klonipin, Rivotril)
* [[levetiracetam]] (Keppra)
* [[bromides]]

The following medications may aggravate seizures in Dravet syndrome:<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/><ref>http://idea-league.org/care-and-treatment</ref>
* [[lamotrigine]] (Lamictal)
* [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin, Epanutin)
* [[fosphenytoin]] (Cerebyx, Prodilantin)
* [[carbamazepine]] (Tegretol, Calepsin, Cargagen, Barbatrol, Epitol, Finlepsin, Sirtal, Stazepine)
* [[oxcarbazepine]] (Trileptal)
* [[vigabatrin]] (Sabril, Sabrilan, Sabrilex)

Non-pharmacologic therapy with the [[ketogenic diet]] has been shown to improve seizure control in a significant percentage of children with Dravet syndrome.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.05705.x/abstract</ref>

Focal resective surgery is usually not helpful as SMEI is a systemic disorder without identifiable focal pathology.
