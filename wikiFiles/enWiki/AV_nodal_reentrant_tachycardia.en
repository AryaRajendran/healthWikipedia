{{distinguish|Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia}}
'''AV nodal reentrant tachycardia''' ('''AVNRT'''), or '''atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia''', is a type of [[tachycardia]] (fast rhythm) of the [[heart]].  It is a type of [[supraventricular tachycardia]] (SVT), meaning that it originates from a location within the heart above the [[bundle of His]]. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common regular supraventricular tachycardia. It is more common in women than men (approximately 75% of cases occur in females). The main symptom is [[palpitations]]. Treatment may be with specific physical maneuvers, [[medication]], or, rarely, synchronized [[cardioversion]]. Frequent attacks may require [[radiofrequency ablation]], in which the abnormally conducting tissue in the heart is destroyed.

AVNRT occurs when a [[cardiac arrhythmia#Re-entry|reentry]] circuit forms within or just next to the [[AV node|atrioventricular node]]. The circuit usually involves two anatomical pathways: the fast pathway and the slow pathway, which are both in the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. The slow pathway (which is usually targeted for ablation) is located inferior and slightly posterior to the [[AV node]], often following the anterior margin of the [[coronary sinus]]. The fast pathway is usually located just superior and posterior to the AV node. These pathways are formed from tissue that behaves very much like the AV node, and some authors regard them as ''part of'' the AV node.

The fast and slow pathways should not be confused with the accessory pathways that give rise to [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]] (WPW syndrome) or [[AV reentrant tachycardia|atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia]] (AVRT). In AVNRT, the fast and slow pathways are located within the right atrium close to or within the AV node and exhibit electrophysiologic properties similar to AV nodal tissue. Accessory pathways that give rise to WPW syndrome and AVRT are located in the [[Fibrous rings of heart|atrioventricular valvular rings]]. They provide a direct connection between the atria and [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]], and have [[electrophysiology|electrophysiologic]] properties similar to ventricular [[myocardium]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptom is the sudden development of rapid regular palpitations. Often, no precipitant is present, although some report development of symptoms in stressful situations, consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[caffeine]], or other factors.

In some cases, the onset of the tachycardia is associated with a brief drop in [[blood pressure]]. When this happens, the patient may experience [[dizziness]] or rarely [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting). If the heart rate is very fast, and the patient has underlying [[coronary artery disease]] (obstruction of the arteries of the heart by [[atherosclerosis]]), [[chest pain]] similar to [[angina]] may be experienced; this pain is band- or pressure-like around the chest and often radiates to the left arm and angle of the left jaw. AVNRT is rarely life-threatening.

==Diagnosis==
If the symptoms are present while the patient is attending medical care (e.g. emergency department), an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG) may show typical changes that confirm the diagnosis. If the palpitations are recurrent, a doctor may request a [[Holter monitor]] (24 hour or longer portable ECG) recording. Again, this will show the diagnosis if the recorder is attached at the time of the symptoms. Rarely, disabling but infrequent episodes of palpitations may require the insertion of a small microchip-based device (e.g. [[Reveal Plus]]) under the skin that continuously record heart activity, and can be read through the skin after an episode. All these ECG-based technologies also enable the distinction between AVNRT and other tachycardias such as [[atrial fibrillation]], [[atrial flutter]], [[sinus tachycardia]], [[ventricular tachycardia]] and tachyarrhythmias related to [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]], all of which may have symptoms that are similar to AVNRT.

[[Blood test]]s commonly performed in people with palpitations are:
* [[thyroid function tests]] (TFTs) - an [[hyperthyroidism|overactive thyroid]] increases the risk of AVNRT
* [[electrolyte]]s - disturbances in [[potassium]], [[calcium in biology|calcium]] and [[magnesium]] may predispose to AVNRT
* [[cardiac marker]]s - if there is a concern that [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) has occurred either as a cause or as a result of the AVNRT; this is usually only the case if the patient has experienced chest pain

==Classification==
There are several types of AVNRT. The "common form" or "usual" AVNRT utilizes the slow AV nodal pathway as the anterograde limb of the circuit and the fast AV nodal pathway as the retrograde limb.  The reentry circuit can be reversed such that the fast AV nodal pathway is the anterograde limb and the slow AV nodal pathway is the retrograde limb. This, not surprisingly, is referred to as the "uncommon form" of AVNRT.  However, there is also a third type of AVNRT that utilizes the slow AV nodal pathway as the anterograde limb and left atrial fibers that approach the AV node from the left side of the inter-atrial septum as the retrograde limb. This is known as atypical, or Slow-Slow AVNRT. <ref>http://lifeinthefastlane.com/2009/09/avnrt-ecg/</ref>

===Common AVNRT===
In common AVNRT, the anterograde conduction is via the slow pathway and the retrograde conduction is via the fast pathway ("slow-fast" AVNRT).

Because the retrograde conduction is via the fast pathway, stimulation of the atria (which produces the inverted P wave) will occur at the same time as stimulation of the ventricles (which causes the QRS complex).  As a result, the inverted P waves may not be seen on the surface [[ECG]] since they are buried with the QRS complexes. Often the retrograde p-wave is visible, but also in continuity with the QRS complex, appearing as a "pseudo R prime" wave in lead V1 or a "pseudo S" wave in the inferior leads.

===Uncommon AVNRT===
In uncommon AVNRT, the anterograde conduction is via the fast pathway and the retrograde conduction is via the slow pathway ("fast-slow" AVNRT). 

Multiple slow pathways can exist so that both anterograde and retrograde conduction are over slow pathways. ("slow-slow" AVNRT).

Because the retrograde conduction is via the slow pathway, stimulation of the atria will be delayed by the slow conduction tissue and will typically produce an inverted P wave that falls after the QRS complex on the surface [[ECG]].

==Treatment==
An episode of [[supraventricular tachycardia]] (SVT) due to AVNRT can be terminated by any action that transiently blocks the [[AV node]]. Various methods are possible.

===Vagal maneuvers===
Some people with known AVNRT may be able to stop their attack by using various tricks to activate the [[vagus nerve]]. This includes [[carotid sinus massage]] (pressure on the [[carotid sinus]] in the neck) or the [[Valsalva maneuver]] (increasing the pressure in the chest by attempting to exhale against a closed airway).

===Medication===
Medical therapy can be initiated with AV nodal slowing drugs such as [[adenosine]] (which is a pharmacologic [[cardioversion]]), [[beta blocker]]s or non-dihydropyridine [[calcium channel blocker]]s (such as [[verapamil]]). Numerous other antiarrhythmic drugs may be effective if the more commonly used medications have not worked; these include [[flecainide]] or [[amiodarone]]. Both adenosine and beta blockers may cause [[Bronchoconstriction|tightening of the airways]], and are therefore used with caution in people who are known to have [[asthma]].

===Cardioversion===
In very rare instances, [[cardioversion]] (the electrical restoration of a normal heart rhythm) is needed in the treatment of AVNRT. This would normally only happen if all other treatments have been ineffective, or if the fast heart rate is poorly tolerated (e.g. the development of [[heart failure]] symptoms, low blood pressure or coma).

===Electrophysiology===
After being diagnosed with AVNRT, patients can also undergo an [[Electrophysiology study|Electrophysiology (EP) study]] to confirm the diagnosis. [[Catheter ablation]] of the slow pathway, if successfully carried out, can potentially cure the patient of AVNRT.

==Pacemaker-mediated Tachycardia==
A separate form of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia is ''pacemaker-mediated tachycardia'' (PMT), a possible complication of dual-chamber [[artificial pacemaker]]s is. In PMT, the artificial pacemaker forms the anterograde (atrium to ventricle) limb of the circuit and the atrioventricular (AV) node forms the retrograde limb (ventricle to atrium) of the circuit.<ref name=Olshansky>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/159645-overview eMedicine > Pacemaker-Mediated Tachycardia] Author: Brian Olshansky, MD. Coauthor(s): Chirag M Sandesara, MD; Noel G Boyle, MB, BCh, MD, PhD. Updated: Jun 17, 2008</ref> Treatment of PMT typically involves reprogramming the pacemaker.<ref name=Olshansky/>
