The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in any age group and as a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. Younger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

HCM is frequently asymptomatic until sudden cardiac death, and for this reason some suggest routinely screening certain populations for this disease.<ref name="slate"/>

A [[cardiomyopathy]] is a  disease that affects the muscle of the heart. With HCM, the [[sarcomeres]] (contractile elements) in the heart increase in size, which results in the thickening of the heart muscle. In addition, the normal alignment of muscle cells is disrupted, a phenomenon known as ''[[myocardial disarray]]''. HCM also causes disruptions of the electrical functions of the heart. HCM is most commonly due to a mutation in one of 9 sarcomeric [[gene]]s that results in a mutated protein in the sarcomere, the primary component of the [[myocyte]] (the muscle cell of the heart). 

While most literature so far focuses on European, American, and Japanese populations, HCM appears in all racial groups. The prevalence of HCM is about 0.2% to 0.5% of the general population.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The clinical course of HCM is variable. Many patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The [[symptom]]s of HCM include dyspnea (shortness of breath), chest pain (sometimes known as ''[[Angina pectoris|angina]]''), uncomfortable awareness of the [[Cardiac cycle|heart beat]] ([[palpitations]]), [[lightheadedness]], fatigue, [[fainting]] (called [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]]) and [[sudden cardiac death]]. [[Dyspnea]] is largely due to increased stiffness of the left ventricle, which impairs filling of the ventricles and leads to elevated pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium. Symptoms are not closely related to the presence or severity of an outflow tract gradient.<ref name="Braunwauld 2005">{{cite book |chapter=The Cardiomyopathies |author=Bonow R, Braunwald E, Zipes DP, Libby P |title=Braunwald's heart disease: a textbook of cardiovascular medicine |publisher=WB Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |edition=7th |isbn=1-4160-0014-3 }}</ref> Often, symptoms mimic those of [[congestive heart failure]] (esp. activity intolerance & dyspnea), but treatment is very different. To treat with diuretics (a mainstay of CHF treatment) will exacerbate symptoms in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by decreasing ventricular volume and increasing outflow resistance.

Major risk factors for sudden death in individuals with HCM include prior history of cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation, spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia, family history of premature sudden death, unexplained syncope, LV thickness greater than or equal to 30 mm, abnormal exercise blood pressure and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. <ref name="ACC">{{cite journal |author=Maron BJ, McKenna WJ, Danielson GK, ''et al.'' |title=American College of Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology clinical expert consensus document on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is inherited as an [[autosomal dominant]] trait and is attributed to mutations in one of a number of genes that encode for one of the [[sarcomere]] [[protein]]s.

About 50-60% of patients with a high index of clinical suspicion for HCM will have a mutation identified in at least 1 of 9 sarcomeric genes. Approximately 45% of these mutations occur in the β [[myosin]] heavy chain gene on [[chromosome]] 14 q11.2-3, while approximately 35% involve the cardiac myosin binding protein C gene. Since HCM is typically an [[autosomal dominant]] trait, children of an HCM parent have 50% chance of inheriting the disease-causing mutation. Whenever a mutation is identified through genetic testing, family-specific genetic testing can be used to identify relatives at-risk for the disease ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&part=hyper-card#hyper-card HCM Genetic Testing Overview]). 

In individuals without a family history of HCM, the most common cause of the disease is a [[mutation|de novo mutation]] of the gene that produces the β-myosin heavy chain.

An insertion/deletion polymorphism in the [[gene]] encoding for [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE) alters the clinical [[phenotype]] of the disease. The D/D (deletion/deletion) genotype of ACE is associated with more marked hypertrophy of the left ventricle and may be associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes.<ref name="Doolan, Nguyen et al. 2004">{{cite journal |author=Doolan G, Nguyen L, Chung J, Ingles J, Semsarian C |title=Progression of left ventricular hypertrophy and the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |journal=Int J Cardiol |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=157–63 |year=2004 |month=Aug |pmid=15314809 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2004.05.003 }}</ref><ref name="Marian, Yu et al. 1993">{{cite journal |author=Marian AJ, Yu QT, Workman R, Greve G, Roberts R |title=Angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death |journal=Lancet |volume=342 |issue=8879 |pages=1085–6 |year=1993 |month=Oct |pmid=8105312 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(93)92064-Z|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(93)92064-Z}}</ref>

Some mutations (troponin) have much more malignant potential compared to others (β myosin heavy chain). For example, troponin T mutations are associated with a 50% mortality before the age of 40.

==Pathophysiology==
Individuals with HCM have some degree of [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]. Usually this is an asymmetric hypertrophy, involving the inter-ventricular septum, and is known as asymmetric septal hypertrophy.<ref>[http://www.cardiomyopathy.org/html/which_card_hcm.htm ASH]</ref> This is in contrast to the concentric hypertrophy seen in [[aortic stenosis]] or [[hypertension]]. About two-thirds of individuals with HCM have asymmetric septal hypertrophy.

About 25% of individuals with HCM demonstrate an obstruction to the outflow of blood from the left ventricle during rest. In as much as 70% of patients however obstruction can be provoked under certain conditions. This is known as dynamic outflow obstruction, because the degree of obstruction is variable and is dependent on the loading conditions (ventricular filling and arterial blood pressure) and the contactility state of the left venticle.

Myocardial hypertrophy and extracellular fibrosis predispose to increased left venticular stiffness which in concert with compromised cellular energetics and abnormal calcium handling lead to diastolic dysfunction manifested as dyspnea and exercise intolerance.

The altered structure of the coronary vessels and increased diastolic pressure (reduced blood supply) together with the hypertrophy and the outflow tract obstruction (increased demand) cause myocardial ischemia that is manifested as angina and may be responsible for the triggering of venticular arrhythmias.

In about 30% of patients there are abnormal vascular responses and inability to increase systolic blood pressure during exercise. This is attributed to exaggerated cardiac inhibitory reflexes initiated by increased myocardial wall stress and to elevated levels of vasodilating substances (natriuretic peptides).

Dynamic outflow obstruction (when present in HCM) is usually due to systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet of the [[mitral valve]]. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) was initially thought to be due to the septal subaortic bulge, narrowing the outflow tract, causing high velocity flow and a [[Venturi effect]]—a local underpressure in the outflow tract. Low pressure was thought to suck the mitral valve anteriorly into the septum. But SAM onset is observed to be a low velocity phenomenon: SAM begins at velocities no different from those measured in normals.<ref name="Jiang, Levine et al. 1987">{{cite journal |author=Jiang L, Levine RA, King ME, Weyman AE |title=An integrated mechanism for systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on echocardiographic observations |journal=Am Heart J. |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=633–44 |year=1987 |month=Mar |pmid=3825854 |doi= 10.1016/0002-8703(87)90701-0|url=}}</ref><ref name="Sherrid, Gunsburg et al. 2000">{{cite journal |author=Sherrid MV, Gunsburg DZ, Moldenhauer S, Pearle G |title=Systolic anterior motion begins at low left ventricular outflow tract velocity in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |journal=J Am Coll Cardiol. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=1344–54 |year=2000 |month=Oct |pmid=11028493 |doi= 10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00830-5|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735-1097(00)00830-5}}</ref> Hence, the magnitude and importance of Venturi forces in the outflow tract are much less than previously thought, and Venturi forces cannot be the main force that initiates SAM.

As SAM progresses in early systole the angle between outflow and the protruding mitral leaflet increases. A greater surface area of the leaflets is now exposed to drag which amplifies the force on the leaflets – drag increases with increasing angle relative to flow.<ref name="Sherrid, Chu et al. 1993"/> An analogy is an open door in a drafty corridor: the door starts by moving slowly and then accelerates as it presents a greater surface area to the wind and finally it slams shut. The necessary conditions that predispose to SAM are: anterior position of the mitral valve in the LV, altered LV geometry that allows flow to strike the mitral valve from behind, and chordal slack.<ref name="Jiang, Levine et al. 1987"/>
<ref name="Sherrid, Gunsburg et al. 2000"/><ref name="Sherrid, Chu et al. 1993"/>
<ref name="Levine, Vlahakes et al. 1995"/>SAM may be considered anteriorly directed mitral prolapse.<ref name="Sherrid, Gunsburg et al. 2000"/><ref name="Sherrid, Chu et al. 1993"/><ref name="Levine, Vlahakes et al. 1995"/>In both conditions the mitral valve is enlarged and is displaced in systole by the pushing force of flow resulting in mitral regurgitation.

Because the mitral valve leaflet doesn't get pulled into the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) until after the aortic valve opens, the initial upstroke of the arterial pulse will be normal. When the mitral valve leaflet gets pushed into the LVOT, the arterial pulse will momentarily collapse and be followed by a second rise, as the left ventricular pressure overcomes the increased obstruction that SAM of the mitral valve causes. This can be seen on the physical examination as a double tap upon palpation of the apical impulse and as a double pulsation upon palpation of the carotid pulse, known as ''[[bifid pulse]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mangione|first=Salvatore|title=Physical Diagnosis Secrets|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=Philadelphia}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
A [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is based upon a number of features of the disease process. While there is use of [[echocardiogram|echocardiography]], [[cardiac catheterization]], or cardiac [[MRI]] in the diagnosis of the disease, other important factors include [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] and [[genetic test]] (although not primarily used for diagnosis)<ref name="Canada Gen Test" /> findings and if there is any family history of HCM or unexplained sudden death in otherwise healthy individuals.

===Obstructive and non-obstructive {{anchor|Obstructive and non-obstructive}} ===
Depending on whether the distortion of normal heart anatomy causes an obstruction of the outflow of [[blood]] from the [[left ventricle]] of the heart, HCM can be defined as obstructive or non-obstructive. 

* The obstructive variant of HCM, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) has also historically been known as [[idiopathic]] hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) and asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH).

* Another, non-obstructive variant of HCM is apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,<ref name=pmid8685759>{{citation

The physical findings of HCM are associated with the dynamic outflow obstruction that is often present with this disease.

Upon [[auscultation]], the [[heart murmur]] will sound similar to the murmur of [[aortic stenosis]]. However, a murmur due to HCM will increase in intensity with any maneuver that decreases the volume of blood in the left ventricle (such as standing abruptly or the strain phase of a [[Valsalva maneuver]]). Administration of [[amyl nitrite]] will also accentuate the murmur by decreasing [[venous return]] to the heart. Classically, the murmur is also loudest at the left parasternal edge, 4th intercostal space, rather than in the aortic area.

If dynamic outflow obstruction exists, physical examination findings that can be elicited include the [[pulsus bisferiens]] and the double apical impulse with each ventricular contraction. These findings, when present, can help differentiate HCM from [[aortic stenosis]]. In addition, if the individual has [[premature ventricular contraction]]s (PVCs), the change in the carotid pulse intensity in the beat after the PVC can help differentiate HCM from aortic stenosis. In individuals with HCM, the pulse pressure will decrease in the beat after the PVC, while in aortic stenosis, the pulse pressure will increase. However, the murmur intensity increases with both aortic stenosis and HCM post-PVC.

===Cardiac catheterization===
[[Image:Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy - Intraventricular Pressure Tracing.png|thumb|Pressure tracings demonstrating the Brockenbrough–Braunwald–Morrow sign<br>AO = Descending aorta; LV = Left ventricle; ECG = Electrocardiogram.<br>After the third [[electrocardiogram|QRS complex]], the ventricle has more time to fill. Since there is more time to fill, the left ventricle will have more volume at the end of [[diastole]] (increased [[Preload (cardiology)|preload]]). Due to the [[Frank–Starling law of the heart]], the contraction of the left ventricle (and pressure generated by the left ventricle) will be greater on the subsequent beat (beat #4 in this picture). Because of the dynamic nature of the outflow obstruction in HCM, the obstruction increases ''more'' than the left ventricular pressure increase. This causes a fall in the aortic pressure as the left ventricular pressure rises (seen as the yellow shaded area in the picture).]]

Upon [[cardiac catheterization]], [[catheter]]s can be placed in the left ventricle and the ascending [[aorta]], to measure the pressure difference between these structures. In normal individuals, during ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systole]], the pressure in the ascending aorta and the left ventricle will equalize, and the aortic valve is open. In individuals with [[aortic stenosis]] or with HCM with an outflow tract gradient, there will be a pressure gradient (difference) between the left ventricle and the aorta, with the left ventricular pressure higher than the aortic pressure. This gradient represents the degree of obstruction that has to be overcome in order to eject blood from the left ventricle.

The Brockenbrough–Braunwald–Morrow sign is observed in individuals with HCM with outflow tract gradient. This sign can be used to differentiate HCM from aortic stenosis. In individuals with aortic stenosis, after a [[premature ventricular contraction]] (PVC), the following ventricular contraction will be more forceful, and the pressure generated in the left ventricle will be higher. Because of the fixed obstruction that the stenotic aortic valve represents, the post-PVC ascending aortic pressure will increase as well. In individuals with HCM, however, the degree of obstruction will increase more than the force of contraction will increase in the post-PVC beat. The result of this is that the left ventricular pressure increases and the ascending aortic pressure ''decreases'', with an increase in the LVOT gradient.

While the Brockenbrough–Braunwald–Morrow sign is most dramatically demonstrated using simultaneous intra-cardiac and intra-aortic catheters, it can be seen on routine physical examination as a decrease in the pulse pressure in the post-PVC beat in individuals with HCM.

==Treatment==

===Asymptomatic patients===

A significant number of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy do not have any symptoms and will have normal life expectancies, though they should be counseled to avoid particularly strenuous activities or competitive athletics.  These patients should also be screened for risk factors for sudden cardiac death.  In patients with resting or inducible outflow obstructions, situations that will cause dehydration or vasodilation (such as the use of vasodilatory or diuretic blood pressure medications) should be avoided.  Septal reductions therapy is not recommended in asymptomatic patients.<ref name="JACC">{{cite journal |author=Gersh BJ, Maron BJ, Bonow RO, ''et al.'' |title=2011 ACCF/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines |journal=J.

===Medications===

The primary goal of medications is to relieve symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. [[Beta blockers]] are considered first-line agents, as they can slow down the heart rate.  For patients who cannot tolerate beta blockers or do not have good control of symptoms with beta blockers, nondihydropiridine [[calcium channel blockers]] such as [[verapamil]] can be used. These medications also decrease the heart rate, though their use in patients with severe outflow obstruction, elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure and low blood pressures should be done with caution.  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with evidence of obstruction. For patients who continue to have symptoms despite the above treatments, [[disopyramide]] can be considered for further symptom relief.  Diuretics can be considered for patients with evidence of fluid overload, though cautiously used in those with evidence of obstruction. Patients who continue to have symptoms despite drug therapy can consider more invasive therapies.<ref name="JACC">{{cite journal |author=Gersh BJ, Maron BJ, Bonow RO, ''et al.'' |title=2011 ACCF/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines |journal=J.

===Surgical myectomy===
Surgical [[septal myectomy]] is an open heart operation done to relieve symptoms in patients who remain severely symptomatic despite medical therapy.<ref name="Maron 2002"/><ref name="Sherrid Chaudhry et al. 2003"/><ref name="Wigle, Rakowski et al. 1995"/><ref name="Maron, McKenna et al. 2003"/><ref name="Sherrid, Barac et al. 2005">{{cite journal |author=Sherrid MV, Barac I, McKenna WJ, ''et al.'' |title=Multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of disopyramide in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |journal=J Am Coll Cardiol. |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=1251–8 |year=2005 |month=Apr |pmid=15837258 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2005.01.012 |url=}}</ref><ref name="Morrow 1978">{{cite journal |author=Morrow AG |title=Hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.

It has been performed successfully for more than 25 years. Surgical septal myectomy uniformly decreases left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and improves symptoms, and in experienced centers has a surgical mortality of less than 1%, as well as 85% success rate.<ref name="Behr & McKenna" />  It involves a median sternotomy (general anesthesia, opening the chest, and cardiopulmonary bypass) and removing a portion of the interventricular septum.<ref name="Maron 2002"/> Surgical myectomy resection focused just on the subaortic septum, to increase the size of the outflow tract to reduce Venturi forces may be inadequate to abolish systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. With this limited sort of resection the residual mid-septal bulge still redirects flow posteriorly: SAM persists because flow still gets behind the mitral valve. It is only when the deeper portion of the septal bulge is resected that flow is redirected anteriorly away from the mitral valve, abolishing SAM.<ref name="Sherrid Chaudhry et al. 2003"/><ref name="Nakatani, Schwammenthal et al. 1996">{{cite journal |author=Nakatani S, Schwammenthal E, Lever HM, Levine RA, Lytle BW, Thomas JD |title=New insights into the reduction of mitral valve systolic anterior motion after ventricular septal myectomy in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy |journal=Am Heart J. |volume=131 |issue=2 |pages=294–300 |year=1996 |month=Feb |pmid=8579024 |doi= 10.1016/S0002-8703(96)90357-9|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-8703(96)90357-9}}</ref>

Complications of septal myectomy surgery include possible death, arrhythmias, infection,incessant bleeding, septal perforation/defect, stroke.<ref name="Behr & McKenna" />

===Alcohol septal ablation===
[[Alcohol septal ablation]], introduced by [[Ulrich Sigwart]] in 1994, is a percutaneous technique that involves injection of alcohol into one or more septal branches of the [[coronary circulation|left anterior descending artery]]. This is a technique with results similar to the surgical septal myectomy procedure but is less invasive, since it does not involve general anaesthesia and opening of the chest wall and pericardium (which are done in a septal myomectomy). In a select population with symptoms secondary to a high outflow tract gradient, alcohol septal ablation can reduce the symptoms of HCM.  In addition, older individuals and those with other medical problems, for whom surgical myectomy would pose increased procedural risk, would likely benefit from the lesser invasive septal ablation procedure.<ref name="Maron 2002"/><ref name="Wigle, Rakowski et al. 1995"/><ref name="Brilakis and Nishimura 2003">{{cite journal |author=Brilakis ES, Nishimura RA |title=Severe pulmonary hypertension in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: response to alcohol septal ablation |journal=[[Heart (journal)|Heart]] |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=790 |year=2003 |month=Jul |pmid=12807862 |pmc=1767712 |doi= 10.1136/heart.89.7.790|url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12807862}}</ref>

When performed properly, an alcohol septal ablation induces a controlled [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], in which the portion of the interventricular septum that involves the left ventricular outflow tract is infarcted and will contract into a scar.  Which patients are best served by surgical myectomy, alcohol septal ablation, or medical therapy is an important topic and one which is intensely debated in medical scientific circles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Alan Heldman|Heldman AW]], Wu KC, Abraham TP, [[Duke Cameron|Cameron DE]] |title=Myectomy or alcohol  ablation surgery and percutaneous intervention go another round |journal=J Am Coll Cardiol. |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=358–60 |year=2007 |month=Jan |pmid=17239718 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2006.10.029 |url=}}</ref>

===Ventricular pacing===
The use of a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] has been advocated in a subset of individuals, in order to cause asynchronous contraction of the left ventricle. Since the pacemaker activates the interventricular septum before the left ventricular free wall, the gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract may decrease. This form of treatment has been shown to provide less relief of symptoms and less of a reduction in the left ventricular outflow tract gradient when compared to surgical myectomy.<ref name="Ommen, Nishimura et al. 1999">{{cite journal |author=Ommen SR, Nishimura RA, Squires RW, Schaff HV, Danielson GK, Tajik AJ |title=Comparison of dual-chamber pacing versus septal myectomy for the treatment of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison of objective hemodynamic and exercise end points |journal=J Am Coll Cardiol |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=191–6 |year=1999 |month=Jul |pmid=10400010 |doi= 10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00173-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735109799001734}}</ref> Technological advancements have also lead to the development of a dual-chamber pacemaker, which is only turned on when needed (in contrast to a regular pacemaker which provides a constant stimulus). Although the dual-chamber pacemaker has shown to decrease ventricular outflow tract obstruction, experimental trials have only found few individuals with improved symptoms.<ref name="Coats & Elliot" /> Unfortunately, researchers suspect that these reports of "improved" symptoms are due to a placebo effect.<ref name="Behr & McKenna" /> 
*Procedure includes an incision on the anterolateral area below the clavicle. Two leads are then inserted; one into the right atria and the other into the right ventricular apex via the subclavian veins. Once in place, they are secured and attached to the generator which will remain inside the patient's fascia, anterior to the pectoral muscle.<ref name="Behr & McKenna" /> Complications of this procedure include infection, electrical lead and generator malfunction which will require replacement.<ref name="Behr & McKenna" />

===Cardiac transplantation===
In cases that are refractory to all other forms of treatment, [[heart transplant|cardiac transplantation]] is one option. It is also the only treatment available for end-stage heart failure.<ref name="Coats & Elliot" /> However, transplantation must occur before the onset of symptoms such as pulmonary vessel hypertension, kidney malfunction, and thromboembolism in order for it to be successful. Studies have indicated a seven year survival rate in 94% in patients after transplantation.<ref name="Coats & Elliot" />

==In children==
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most uncommon cardiac malformations encountered in pediatric cardiology. This attributed largely to the phenotypes is usually absent, incomplete, or delayed into adulthood. Most of current information pertaining HCM arises from studies in adult populations, and the implication of these observations for pediatric population is often uncertain.<ref name="Colan 2010 433–444">{{cite journal|last=Colan|first=Steven|title=Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Childhood|journal=Heart Fail Clin|year=2010|month=October|volume=6|issue=4|pages=433–444|doi=10.1016/j.hfc.2010.05.004|pmid=20869644|pmc=2946944}}</ref> Nonetheless, recent studies in pediatric cardiology have revealed that HCM accounts for 42% of childhood cardiomyopathies with an incidence report of 0.47/100,000 in children.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lipshultz|first=SE|coauthors=Sleeper LA, Towbin JA|title=The incident of pediatric cardiomyopathy in two regions of the united states|journal=N Eng J Med.|year=2003|volume=348|issue=17|pages=1647–55|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa021715}}</ref> Further, in asymptomatic cases, sudden death is considered one of the most feared complications associated with the disease in select pediatric population. Consequently, the recommended practice is to start screening children of affected individuals throughout childhood to detect cardiac abnormalities at an early stage in hope to prevent further complication of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Colan|first=Steve|title=Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in childhood|journal=Heart. Fail. Clin.|year=2010|volume=6|pages=433–44|doi=10.1016/j.hfc.2010.05.004|issue=4|pmid=20869644|pmc=2946944}}</ref> 

Generally, the diagnosis of HCM in a pediatric population is made during assessment for murmur, congestive heart failure, physical exhaustion, and genetic testing of children of affected individuals.<ref name="Colan 2010 433–444"/> Specifically, echocardiogram (ECHO) has been used as a definitive noninvasive diagnostic tool in nearly all children.  ECHO assesses cardiac ventricular size, wall thickness, systolic and diastolic function, and outflow obstruction. Thus, ECHO has been chosen as an ideal means to detect excessive wall thickening of cardiac muscle in HCM.<ref name="Colan 2010 433–444"/>

In HCM, treatment strategies aimed to reduce disease symptoms and lower the risk of sudden death.<ref name="Maskatia 2012 84–92">{{cite journal|last=Maskatia|first=Shiraz|title=Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: infants, children and adolescents|journal=Congenit Heart Dis|year=2012|volume=7|pages=84–92|doi=10.1111/j.1747-0803.2011.00613.x|pmid=22222117|issue=1}}</ref> Due to the heterogeneity of the disease, treatment is usually modified according to individual patients needs.<ref name="Maskatia 2012 84–92"/> β-blockers improve left ventricular filling and relaxation and thereby improve symptoms. In some pediatric patients, β–blockers drugs (e.g. propranolol) were shown to effectively reduce the risk of sudden death.<ref name="Maskatia 2012 84–92"/> Further, calcium channel blockers (verapamil) and antiarrhythmic drugs maybe used as an adjunct therapy to β-blockers in symptomatic children. Nonetheless, further testing is needed to determine their definitive benefits.<ref name="Maskatia 2012 84–92"/>

Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common [[heart disease]] in [[cat]]s; the disease process and genetics are believed to be similar to the disease in [[human]]s.<ref name="Kittleson, Meurs et al. 1999">{{cite journal | author = Kittleson M, Meurs K, Munro M, Kittleson J, Liu S, Pion P, Towbin J | title = Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Maine coon cats: an animal model of human disease | journal = Circulation | volume = 99 | issue = 24 | pages = 3172–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10377082}}</ref> In [[Maine Coon]] and [[American Shorthair]] cat breeds, HCM has been confirmed as an autosomal dominant inherited trait.<ref>Cat Fancier's Association, Special Report to the Winn Feline Foundation: [http://www.cfa.org/articles/health/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy.html Feline Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Advice for Breeders]</ref> 
The first genetic mutation (in cardiac myosin binding protein C) responsible for feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was discovered in 2005 in [[Maine Coon]] cats.<ref name="Meurs, Sanchez et al. 2005">{{cite journal | author = Meurs K, Sanchez X, David R, Bowles N, Towbin J, Reiser P, Kittleson J, Munro M, Dryburgh K, Macdonald K, Kittleson M | title = A cardiac myosin binding protein C mutation in the Maine Coon cat with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | journal = Hum Mol Genet | volume = 14 | issue = 23 | pages = 3587–93 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16236761 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddi386}}</ref> A test for this mutation is available.<ref>[http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/vhc/csds/vcgl/mc-faq.html#science/ North Carolina State University, Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Laboratory of the College of Veterinary Medicine]</ref> About one third of Maine Coon cats tested for the mutation have been shown to be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation, although many of these cats have no clinical signs of the disease. Some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed. The cardiac myosin binding protein C mutation identified in Maine Coon cats has not been found in any other breed of cat with HCM but more recently another myosin binding protein C mutation has been identified in Ragdoll cats with HCM.<ref name="Meurs, Kittleson et al. 2007">{{cite journal | author = Meurs KM, Norgard MM, Ederer MM, Hendrix KP, Kittleson MD | title = A substitution mutation in the myosin binding protein C gene in Ragdoll hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | journal = Genomics | volume = 90 | issue = 2 | pages = 261–264 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17521870 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.04.007}}</ref>

While there is no cure for HCM, early detection and regular echocardiograms are key to trying to ward off life-threatening problems.  Early signs may include a murmur or even heart failure.  Unfortunately, death may occur without any other signs present, making the disease a difficult and often deadly one. While medication is commonly given to cats with HCM that have no clinical signs, no medication has been shown to be helpful at this stage and it has been shown that an ACE inhibitor is not beneficial until heart failure is present <ref name="MacDonald, Kittleson et al.">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2006.tb00707.x | author = MacDonald K, Kittleson M, Larson R, Kass P, Klose T, Wisner E | title = The effect of ramipril on left ventricular mass, myocardial fibrosis, diastolic function, an plasma neurohormones in Maine Coon cats with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without heart failure | journal = J Vet Intern Med | volume = 20 | pages = 1093–1105 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17063701 | issue = 5}}</ref> (at which time a diuretic is most beneficial). Diltiazem generally produces no demonstrable benefit. Atenolol is commonly administered when systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is present.

Thromboembolic disease (TED) is relatively common sequelae of Feline HCM. The aetiology remains a little uncertain, but it is thought that ischemic damage to the hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium facilitates thrombus formation and subsequent embolism. Classically the embolus lodges at the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, occluding either one or both of the common iliac arteries. Clinically this presents as a cat with complete loss of function in one or both hindlimbs. The hindlimbs are cold, and the cat is in considerable pain. This pain derives from the exaggerated inflammatory response to the embolus at the point of impact, and the inflammatory mediators released generally have a vasoconstrictor effect further exacerbating the problem. Emboli may, rarely, lodge in other locations, typically the renal or ovarian/testicular arteries as they exit the abdominal aorta.

Treatment of TED is variable - typically very low doses of aspirin may be prescribed (aspirin however is extremely toxic to cats and should only be prescribed and administered by a veterinary surgeon).  Plavix is also another widely used drug that may or may not prevent clot formation in HCM cats.  The FATCAT study at Purdue University is addressing the efficacy of aspirin vs. Plavix for the prevention of a second clot in cats that have already experienced a clot.  Thrombolytic agents (e.g., tissue plasminogen activators) have been used successfully, but their cost is usually prohibitively high in veterinary medicine. Despite the relative efficacy of treatment, the prognosis for cats with TED is poor as they are likely to have significant HCM already, and a recurrent bout of TED is very likely. For this reason euthanasia is often considered in TED cats.
