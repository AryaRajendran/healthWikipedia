'''Mysophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] μύσος - ''musos'', "uncleanness"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmu%2Fsos1 μύσος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and φόβος - ''phobos'', "fear";<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> also called '''germophobia'''/'''germaphobia''', a combination of ''germ'' and ''[[phobia]]'' to mean "fear of germs", as well as '''bacillophobia''', '''bacteriophobia''', and '''spermophobia''') is a [[pathological]] fear of contamination and germs. Someone who has such a fear is referred to as a mysophobe. The term was coined by Dr. [[William Alexander Hammond]] in 1879 when describing a case of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) exhibited in repeatedly washing one's hands. Mysophobia has long been related to the OCD of constantly washing one's hands. However, [[Harry Stack Sullivan]], an American psychologist and psychoanalyst, notes that while fear of dirt underlies the compulsion of a person with this kind of OCD, his or her mental state is not about germs; instead, this person feels ''the hands must be washed''. Other names for abnormal persistent fear of dirt and filth include molysmophobia or molysomophobia, rhypophobia, and rupophobia.
