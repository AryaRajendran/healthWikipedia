'''Asclepius''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|s|ˈ|k|l|iː|p|i|ə|s}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀσκληπιός}} ''Asklēpiós'' {{IPA-el|asklɛːpiós|}}; [[Latin]] ''Aesculapius'') is the god of [[medicine]] and healing in ancient [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]]. Asclepius represents the healing aspect of the medical arts; his daughters are [[Hygieia]] ("Hygiene", the goddess/personification of health, cleanliness, and sanitation), [[Iaso]] (the goddess of recuperation from illness), [[Aceso]] (the goddess of the healing process), [[Aglaea|Aglæa/Ægle]] (the goddess of beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence, and adornment), and [[Panacea]] (the goddess of universal remedy). He was associated with the Roman/Etruscan god [[Vediovis]]. He was one of [[Apollo]]'s sons, sharing with Apollo the epithet ''Paean'' ("the Healer").<ref>Mitchell-Boyask, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5zJ2TlqoorEC&pg=PA141 p. 141]</ref> The [[rod of Asclepius]], a snake-entwined staff, remains a symbol of medicine today.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name is unknown. In his revised version of [[Hjalmar Frisk|Frisk's]] ''Griechisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'' (Greek etymological dictionary), [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R.S.P. Beekes]] gives this summary of the different attempts:

:"H. Grégoire (with R. Goossens and M. Mathieu) in ''Asklépios, Apollon Smintheus et Rudra'' 1949 (Mém. Acad. Roy. de Belgique. Cl. d. lettres. 2. sér. 45), explains the name as 'the mole-hero', connecting {{lang|grc|σκάλοψ, ἀσπάλαξ}} '[[Mole (animal)|mole]]' and refers to the resemblance of the [[Tholos]] in [[Epidaurus|Epidauros]] and the [[Molehill|building of a mole]]. (Thus [[Jaan Puhvel|Puhvel]], ''Comp. Mythol''. 1987, 135.) But the variants of Asklepios and those of the word for 'mole' do not agree.

:The name is typical for Pre-Greek words; apart from minor variations ({{lang|grc|β}} for {{lang|grc|π}}, {{lang|grc|αλ(α)}} for {{lang|grc|λα}}) we find {{lang|grc|α/αι}} (a well known variation; [[Edzard Johan Furnée|Fur.]] 335 - 339) followed by {{lang|grc|-γλαπ-}} or {{lang|grc|-σκλαπ-/-σχλαπ/β-}}, i.e. a [[Voiced velar plosive|voiced velar]] (without {{lang|grc|-σ-}}) or a [[Voiceless velar plosive|voiceless velar]] (or an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] one: we know that there was no distinction between the three in the [[Substratum|substr. language]]) with a {{lang|grc|-σ-}}. I think that the {{lang|grc|-σ-}} renders an original [[affricate]], which (prob. as {{lang|grc|δ}}) was lost before the {{lang|grc|-γ-}} (in Greek the group {{lang|grc|-σγ-}} is rare, and certainly before another consonant); [http://www.indoeuropean.nl/ied/pdf/pre-greek.pdf Beekes Pre-Greek].

:[[Oswald Szemerényi|Szemerényi's]] etymology (''[[Journal of Hellenic Studies|JHS]]'' 94, 1974, 155) from [[Hittite language|Hitt.]] ''assula(a)-'' 'well-being' and ''piya-'' 'give' cannot be correct, as it does not explain the [[Velar plosive|velar]]."<ref>[http://www.indoeuropean.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&root=leiden&basename=\data\ie\greek Greek etymology database]</ref>

One might add that even though Szemerényi's etymology (Hitt. asula- + piya-) does not account for the velar, it is perhaps inserted spontaneously in Greek due to the fact that the cluster -sl- was uncommon in Greek: So, *Aslāpios would become Asklāpios automatically.

==Mythology==
===Birth===
He was the son of Apollo and Coronis. His mother was killed for being unfaithful to Apollo and was laid out on a funeral pyre to be consumed, but the unborn child was rescued from her womb. Or, alternatively, his mother died in labor and was laid out on the pyre to be consumed, but his father rescued the child, cutting him from her womb.  From this he received the name Asklepios, "to cut open."<ref>The [http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Asklepios.html Asklepios cult]</ref> Apollo carried the baby to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] who raised Asclepius and instructed him in the art of medicine.<ref>Pindar, Pythian Ode 3. 5 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric 5th century BC)</ref>

===Wives and offspring===
[[File:Asclepius and hygieia relief.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Asclepios with his daughter Hygieia]]
Asclepios was married to [[Epione]], with whom he had six daughters: [[Hygieia]], [[Meditrina]] (the serpent-bearer),{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}<!--The linked article doesn't seem to be referring to Meditrina in this context (especially as it describes it as a "late" Roman invention.--> [[Panacea]], [[Aceso]], [[Iaso]], and Aglaea,<ref>Greek Lyric V Anonymous, Fragments 939 (Inscription from Erythrai) (trans.

He also sired a son, Aratus, with Aristodama.

At some point, Asclepius was among those who took part in the [[Calydonian Boar]] hunt.

===Death===
[[Zeus]] killed Asclepius with a thunderbolt because he raised [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] from the dead and accepted gold for it.<ref>Philodemus, On Piety (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric IV Stesichorus Frag 147 & Cinesias Frag 774) (7th to 6th centuries BC)</ref> Other stories say that Asclepius was killed because after bringing people back from the dead, Hades thought that no more dead spirits would come to the underworld, so he asked his brother Zeus to remove him. This angered Apollo who in turn murdered the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] who had made the thunderbolts for Zeus.<ref>Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 121 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer 2nd century AD)</ref> For this act, Zeus suspended Apollo from the night sky<ref>Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 610 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic 3rd century BC)</ref> and commanded Apollo to serve [[Admetus]], King of [[Thessaly]] for a year. Once the year had passed, Zeus brought Apollo back to Mount Olympus and revived the Cyclopes that made his thunderbolts.<ref name="ReferenceB" /><ref>Hyginus, Fabulae 49 (trans.

Some sources also stated that Asclepius was later resurrected as a god by Zeus to prevent any further feuds with Apollo.

==Sacred places and practices==
{{Greek myth (other gods)}}
[[File:Aesculap 147-.png|120px|left|Majestic Zeus-like facial features of Asclepius head (Melos)]]
The most famous temple of Asclepius was at [[Epidaurus]] in north-eastern [[Peloponnese]]. Another famous healing temple (or [[asclepieion]]) was located on the island of [[Kos]], where [[Hippocrates]], the legendary "father of medicine", may have begun his career. Other asclepieia were situated in [[Trikala]], [[Gortys]] (in Arcadia), and [[Pergamum]] in [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]].

In honor of Asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes — the [[Aesculapian Snake]]s — slithered around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world. From about 300 BC onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples ([[Asclepieion|Asclepieia]]) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary - the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation.<ref>Sigerist. Chapter 3, ''Religious medicine: Asclepius and his cult'', p. 63ff.</ref> Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners.<ref name="farnell">Farnell, Chapter 10, "The Cult of Asklepios" (pp.234-279)</ref>

The original [[Hippocratic Oath]] began with the invocation "I swear by Apollo the Physician and by Asclepius and by Hygieia and Panacea and by all the gods ..."<ref name="farnell" />

Some later religious movements claimed links to Asclepius. In the 2nd century AD [[Alexander of Abonutichus|the controversial miracle-worker Alexander]] claimed that his god [[Glycon]], a snake with a "head of linen"<ref name="tertullian">Lucian, Alexander the False Prophet (trans A.M. Harmon) (Cambridge:  Loeb Classical Library, 1936), Lucian, vol IV. Accessible online at http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm</ref>  was an incarnation of Asclepius. The Greek language [[rhetorician]] and [[satirist]] [[Lucian]] produced the work [[Alexander the False Prophet]] to denounce the swindler for future generations. He described Alexander as having a character "made up of lying, trickery, perjury, and malice; [it was] facile, audacious, venturesome, diligent in the execution of its schemes, plausible, convincing, masking as good, and wearing an appearance absolutely opposite to its purpose."<ref name="tertullian" /> [[Justin Martyr]], a philosophical defender of Christianity who wrote around 160 AD claimed that the myth of Asclepius foreshadowed rather than served as a source for claims of Jesus's healing powers.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/richardson/fathers.x.ii.iii.html?highlight=asclepius#highlight CCEL.org] First Apology 54:10</ref> In Rome, the [[College of Aesculapius and Hygia]] was an association ''([[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]])'' that served as a [[burial society]] and [[dining club]] that also participated in [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

The botanical genus ''[[Asclepias]]'' (commonly known as milkweed) is named after him and includes the medicinal plant ''A. tuberosa'' or "Pleurisy root".

Asclepius was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Greek 10,000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1995-2001.<ref>[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/default.aspx Bank of Greece].
