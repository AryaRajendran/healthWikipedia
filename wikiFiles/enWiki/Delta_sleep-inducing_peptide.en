'''Delta sleep-inducing peptide''', abbreviated '''DSIP''', is a [[neuropeptide]] that when infused into the mesodiencephalic ventricle of
recipient rabbits induces spindle and delta [[EEG]] activity and reduced motor activities.<ref name="pmid862769">{{cite journal | author = Monnier M, Dudler L, Gächter R, Maier PF, Tobler HJ, Schoenenberger GA | title = The delta sleep inducing peptide (DSIP).

Its aminoacid sequence is [[tryptophan|Тrр]]-[[alanine|Аlа]]-[[glycine|Gly]]-Gly-[[aspartic acid|Asp]]-Ala-[[serine|Ser]]-Gly-[[glutamic acid|Glu]].  However, it is the only neuropeptide in history whose gene is unknown{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, raising serious questions regarding the actual existence of this peptide in nature.

== Discovery ==
Delta sleep-inducing peptide was first discovered in 1974 by the Swiss Schoenenberger-Monnier group who isolated it from the cerebral venous blood of rabbits in an induced state of sleep. It was primarily believed to be involved in sleep regulation due to its apparent ability to induce [[slow-wave sleep]] in rabbits, but studies on the subject have been contradictory.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00591565 | author = Schoenenberger GA, Maier PF, Tobler HJ and Monnier M | title = A naturally occurring delta-EEG enhancing nonapeptide in rabbits | journal = European Journal of Physiology | volume = 369 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–109 | year = 1977 | pmid = 560681}}</ref>
