'''Thrombosis''' (Greek: θρόμβωσις) is the formation of a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] ('''thrombus'''; Greek: θρόμβος) inside a [[blood vessel]], obstructing the flow of [[blood]] through the [[circulatory system]]. When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses [[platelets]] ([[thrombocytes]]) and [[fibrin]] to form a [[blood clot]] to prevent blood loss.  Even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an [[embolus]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Furie B, Furie BC | title=Mechanisms of thrombus formation | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | year=2008 | volume=359 | pages=938–949 | doi=10.1056/NEJMra0801082 | pmid=18753650 | issue=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Handin RI |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |chapter=Chapter 53: bleeding and thrombosis}}</ref>

When a thrombus occupies more than 75%{{cn|date=December 2012}} of cross-sectional area of the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of an artery, blood flow to the [[Tissue (anatomy)|tissue]] supplied is reduced enough to cause symptoms because of decreased [[oxygen]] ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]) and accumulation of metabolic products like [[lactic acid]]. More than 90%{{cn|date=December 2012}} obstruction can result in [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], the complete deprivation of oxygen, and [[infarction]], a mode of [[cell (biology)|cell]] death.

Thromboembolism is the combination of thrombosis and its main complication, [[embolism]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Causes==
In classical terms, thrombosis is caused by abnormalities in one or more of the following ([[Virchow's triad]]):
* The composition of the blood ([[hypercoagulability]] or ''thrombophilia'')
* Quality of the vessel wall ([[endothelial cell injury]])
* Nature of the blood flow (stasis, turbulence)

===Hypercoagulability===
{{Main|Thrombophilia}}
Hypercoagulability is caused by, for example, genetic deficiencies or autoimmune disorders. Recent studies indicate that neutrophils play a pivotal role in deep venous thrombosis, mediating numerous pro-thrombotic actions  <ref>{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=TA|coauthors=Brill, A, Duerschmied, D, Schatzberg, D, Monestier, M, Myers DD, Jr, Wrobleski, SK, Wakefield, TW, Hartwig, JH, Wagner, DD|title=Extracellular DNA traps promote thrombosis.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2010 Sep 7|volume=107|issue=36|pages=15880–5|pmid=20798043|doi=10.1073/pnas.1005743107|pmc=2936604}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Brill|first=A|coauthors=Fuchs, TA, Savchenko, A, Thomas, GM, Martinod, K, De Meyer, SF, Bhandari, AA, Wagner, DD|title=Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Promote Deep Vein Thrombosis in Mice.|journal=Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH|date=2011 Nov 1|pmid=22044575|doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2011.04544.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Borissoff|first=JI|coauthors=ten Cate, H|title=From neutrophil extracellular traps release to thrombosis: an overshooting host-defense mechanism?|journal=Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH|date=2011 Sep|volume=9|issue=9|pages=1791–4|pmid=21718435|doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2011.04425.x}}</ref>

===Endothelial cell injury===
Causes of injury to the vessel's wall include trauma, surgery, infection or turbulent flow at bifurcations. The main mechanism is exposure of [[tissue factor]] to the blood coagulation system.<ref name=labtestsonline>[http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/hypercoagulable_disorders-3.html labtestsonline > Hypercoagulable Disorders] This article was last reviewed on May 23, 2007 and was last modified on March 6, 2010.</ref>

===Disturbed blood flow===
{{See|Blood flow}}
Causes of disturbed blood flow include stagnation of blood flow past the point of injury, or [[venous stasis]] which may occur in [[heart failure]]<ref name=labtestsonline/> or after long periods of sedentary behavior, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, [[atrial fibrillation]], causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA) or [[left atrial appendage]] (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism.<ref name=labtestsonline/> [[Cancers]] or [[malignancies]] such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by external compression on a blood vessel for example, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins).<ref name=labtestsonline/> Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability.<ref name=labtestsonline/>

==Classification==
There are two distinct forms of thrombosis, venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis, each of which can be presented by several subtypes.

===Venous thrombosis===
{{main|Venous thrombosis}}
Venous thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) within a [[vein]]. There are several diseases which can be classified under this category:

====Deep vein thrombosis====
{{main|Deep vein thrombosis}}
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a blood clot within a [[deep vein]]. It most commonly affects leg veins, such as the [[femoral vein]]. Three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein—these are the rate of blood flow, the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall. Classical signs of DVT include [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], pain and redness of the affected area.

====Portal vein thrombosis====
{{main|Portal vein thrombosis}}
Portal vein thrombosis is a form of venous thrombosis affecting the [[hepatic portal vein]], which can lead to portal [[hypertension]] and reduction of the blood supply to the liver.<ref name="Webster">{{cite journal | last=Webster | first=GJ | coauthors=Burroughs AK, Riordan SM | title=Review article: portal vein thrombosis&nbsp;– new insights into aetiology and management | journal=Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=1–9 | date=January 2005 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118696389/HTMLSTART | pmid=15644039 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02301.x}}</ref> It usually has a pathological cause such as [[pancreatitis]], [[cirrhosis]], [[diverticulitis]] or [[cholangiocarcinoma]].

====Renal vein thrombosis====
{{main|Renal vein thrombosis}}
Renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the [[renal vein]] by a thrombus. This tends to lead to reduced drainage from the kidney. [[Anticoagulation]] therapy is the treatment of choice.

====Jugular vein thrombosis====
{{main|Jugular vein thrombosis}}
Jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection, intravenous drug use or malignancy. Jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications, including: [[sepsis|systemic sepsis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], and [[papilledema]]. Though characterized by a sharp pain at the site of the vein, it can prove difficult to diagnose, because it can occur at random.<ref>eMedicine Article on Internal Jugular Vein Thrombosis by Dr. Dale K. Mueller|http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2762.htm</ref>

====Budd-Chiari syndrome====
{{main|Budd-Chiari syndrome}}
Budd-Chiari syndrome is the blockage of the [[hepatic vein]] or the [[inferior vena cava]]. This form of thrombosis presents with [[abdominal pain]], [[ascites]] and [[hepatomegaly]]. Treatment varies between  therapy and surgical intervention by the use of [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]]s.

====Paget-Schroetter disease====
{{main|Paget-Schroetter disease}}
Paget-Schroetter disease is the obstruction of an [[upper extremity]] vein (such as the [[axillary vein]] or [[subclavian vein]]) by a thrombus. The condition usually comes to light after vigorous exercise and usually presents in younger, otherwise healthy people. Men are affected more than women.

====Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis====
{{main|Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis}}
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare form of [[stroke]] which results from the blockage of the [[dural venous sinuses]] by a thrombus. Symptoms may include [[headache]], abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body and [[seizures]]. The diagnosis is usually made with a [[Computed Tomography|CT]] or [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI scan]]. The majority of persons affected make a full recovery. The [[mortality rate]] is 4.3%.<ref name="Canhao">{{cite journal | last=Canhão | first=P | coauthors=Ferro JM, Lindgren AG et al. | title=Causes and predictors of death in cerebral venous thrombosis | volume=36 | issue=8 | pages=1720–1725 | journal=Stroke | date=August 2005 | url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/8/1720 | pmid=16002765 | doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000173152.84438.1c}}</ref>

===Arterial thrombosis===

Arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an [[artery]]. In most cases, arterial thrombosis follows rupture of [[atheroma]], and is therefore referred to as ''atherothrombosis''.

Another common cause of arterial occlusion is [[atrial fibrillation]], which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation. In addition, it is well known that the direct current [[cardioversion]] of atrial fibrillation carries a great risk of thromboembolism, especially if persisting more than 48 hours. Thromboembolism strikes approximately 5% of cases not receiving [[anticoagulant therapy]]. When cardiac rhythm is restored clots are pushed out from atria to ventricles and from these to the aorta and its branches.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hatzinikolaou-Kotsakou E, Kartasis Z, Tziakas D, ''et al.'' |title=Clotting state after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: a haemostasis index could detect the relationship with the arrhythmia duration |journal=Thromb J |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=2 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15748296 |pmc=555849 |doi=10.1186/1477-9560-3-2 |url=}}</ref>

Arterial thrombosis can embolize and is a major cause of [[arterial embolism]], potentially causing [[infarction]] of almost any organ in the body.

====Stroke====
{{main|Stroke}}
A stroke is the rapid decline of brain function due to a disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain. This can be due to [[ischemia]], thrombus, [[embolus]] (a lodged particle) or [[hemorrhage]] (a bleed). In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around [[atherosclerotic]] plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower. Thrombotic stroke can be divided into two categories—large vessel disease and small vessel disease. The former affects vessels such as the [[internal carotid]]s, [[Vertebral artery|vertebral]] and the [[circle of Willis]]. The latter can affect smaller vessels such as the branches of the circle of Willis.

====Myocardial infarction====
{{main|Myocardial infarction}}
Myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack, is caused by ischemia, (restriction in the blood supply), often due to the obstruction of a [[coronary artery]] by a thrombus. This restriction gives an insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle which then results in tissue death,(infarction). A lesion is then formed which is the [[infarct]]. MI can quickly become fatal if emergency medical treatment is not received promptly. If diagnosed within 12 hours of the initial episode (attack) then [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic therapy]] is initiated.

====Other sites====
Hepatic artery thrombosis usually occurs as a devastating complication after [[liver transplantation]].<ref>Bekker J, Ploem S, de Jong KP. Early hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation: a systematic review of the incidence, outcome and risk factors. Am J Transplant 2009; 9(4):746-57.</ref>

An arterial embolus can also form in the limbs.<ref name=medlineplus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001102.htm MedlinePlus > Arterial embolism] Update Date: 5/8/2008. Updated by: Sean O. Stitham, MD and David C. Dugdale III, MD. Also reviewed by David Zieve, MD</ref>

==Embolization==
If a bacterial infection is present at the site of thrombosis, the thrombus may break down, spreading particles of infected material throughout the [[circulatory system]] ([[pyemia]], [[septic embolus]]) and setting up metastatic abscesses wherever they come to rest. Without an infection, the thrombus may become detached and enter circulation as an [[Embolism|embolus]], finally lodging in and completely obstructing a blood vessel, which unless treated very quickly will lead to tissue necrosis (an [[infarction]]) in the area past the occlusion. If the occlusion is in the coronary artery, myocardial ischaemia is likely to occur, whereby cardiac myocytes cannot function properly due to lack of oxygen.  This lack of oxygen is then likely to result in a myocardial infarction.

Most thrombi, however, become [[Fibrinolysis|organized into fibrous tissue]], and the thrombosed vessel is gradually recanalized.

==Prevention==
Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism with [[heparin]] in medical patients does not appear to decrease mortality and while it may decrease the risk of [[pulmonary embolism]] and [[deep vein thrombosis]] it increases the risk of bleeding and thus results in little or no overall clinical benefit.<ref name=Review11>{{cite journal|last=Lederle|first=FA|coauthors=Zylla, D, Macdonald, R, Wilt, TJ|title=Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients and those with stroke: a background review for an american college of physicians clinical practice guideline.|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2011-11-01|volume=155|issue=9|pages=602–15|pmid=22041949|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-155-9-201111010-00008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Alikhan|first=R|coauthors=Cohen, AT|title=Heparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in general medical patients (excluding stroke and myocardial infarction).|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2009-07-08|issue=3|pages=CD003747|pmid=19588346|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003747.pub2}}</ref> Mechanical measures also appeared of little benefit in this group and in those with a [[stroke]] resulted in harm.<ref name=Review11/> Evidence supports the use of heparin following surgery which has a high risk of thrombosis to reduce the risk of DVTs; however the effect on PEs or overall mortality is not known.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Oates-Whitehead|first=RM|coauthors=D'Angelo, A, Mol, B|title=Anticoagulant and aspirin prophylaxis for preventing thromboembolism after major gynaecological surgery.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|year=2003|issue=4|pages=CD003679|pmid=14583989|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003679}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Handoll|first=HH|coauthors=Farrar, MJ, McBirnie, J, Tytherleigh-Strong, G, Milne, AA, Gillespie, WJ|title=Heparin, low molecular weight heparin and physical methods for preventing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following surgery for hip fractures.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|year=2002|issue=4|pages=CD000305|pmid=12519540|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000305}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Roderick|first=P|coauthors=Ferris, G, Wilson, K, Halls, H, Jackson, D, Collins, R, Baigent, C|title=Towards evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism: systematic reviews of mechanical methods, oral anticoagulation, dextran and regional anaesthesia as thromboprophylaxis.|journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)|date=2005 Dec|volume=9|issue=49|pages=iii–iv, ix–x, 1–78|pmid=16336844}}</ref>

Generally, a risk-benefit analysis is required, as all anticoagulants lead to a small increase in the risk of major bleeding. In [[atrial fibrillation]], for instance, the risk of [[stroke]] (calculated on the basis of additional risk factors, such as advanced age and [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]) needs to outweigh the small but known risk of major bleeding associated with the use of [[warfarin]].<ref>{{NICE|36|Atrial fibrillation|June 2006}}</ref>

In people admitted to hospital, thrombosis is a major cause for complications and occasionally death. In the UK, for instance, the Parliamentary [[Health Select Committee]] heard in 2005 that the annual rate of death due to hospital-acquired thrombosis was 25,000.<ref name=Hunt>{{cite journal |author=Hunt BJ |title=Awareness and politics of venous thromboembolism in the United kingdom |journal=Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=398–9 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18296598 |doi=10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.162586 |url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/28/3/398}}</ref> Hence ''thromboprophylaxis'' (prevention of thrombosis) is increasingly emphasized. In patients admitted for surgery, graded [[compression stockings]] are widely used, and in severe illness, prolonged immobility and in all [[orthopedic surgery]], [[clinical practice guideline|professional guidelines]] recommend [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH) administration, mechanical calf compression or (if all else is contraindicated and the patient has recently suffered deep vein thrombosis) the insertion of a [[Inferior vena cava filter|vena cava filter]].<ref>{{NICE|46|Venous thromboembolism (surgical)|April 2007}}</ref><ref name=ACCP>{{cite journal |author=Geerts WH, Pineo GF, Heit JA, ''et al.'' |title=Prevention of venous thromboembolism: the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy |journal=Chest |volume=126 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=338S–400S |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15383478 |doi=10.1378/chest.126.3_suppl.338S |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/126/3_suppl/338S}}</ref> In patients with medical rather than surgical illness, LMWH too is known to prevent thrombosis,<ref name=ACCP/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dentali F, Douketis JD, Gianni M, Lim W, Crowther MA |title=Meta-analysis: anticoagulant prophylaxis to prevent symptomatic venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients |journal=Ann.

==Treatment==
[[Vitamin K antagonist]]-oral [[anticoagulant]]s reduce thromboembolic occurrence. As side effect, the risk of [[bleeding]] is increased, so the [[international normalized ratio]] of blood is monitored. Self-monitoring and self-management are safe options for competent patients, though their practice varies. In Germany, about 20% of patients were self-managed while only 1% of U.S. patients did home self-testing.<ref name="Heneghan">{{cite journal |author=Heneghan C, Ward A, Perera R |year=2012 |title=Self-monitoring of oral anti-coagulation: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data |journal=The Lancet |volume=379 |issue=9813 |pages=322–334 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61294-4 |pmid= }}</ref>
