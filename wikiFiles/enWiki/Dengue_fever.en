'''Dengue fever''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|ŋ|ɡ|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|d|ɛ|ŋ|ɡ|iː}}), also known as '''breakbone fever''', is an infectious [[tropical disease]] caused by the [[dengue virus]]. Symptoms include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[myalgia|muscle]] and [[arthralgia|joint pains]], and a characteristic [[skin rash]] that is [[morbilliform|similar to measles]]. In a small proportion of cases the disease develops into the life-threatening '''dengue hemorrhagic fever''', resulting in [[bleeding]], [[thrombocytopenia|low levels of blood platelets]] and blood plasma leakage, or into '''dengue shock syndrome''', where [[Shock (circulatory)|dangerously low blood pressure]] occurs.

Dengue is transmitted by several species of [[mosquito]] within the [[genus]] ''[[Aedes]]'', principally ''[[Aedes aegypti|A. aegypti]]''. The virus has four different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications.  As there is no commercially available [[vaccine]], prevention is sought by reducing the habitat and the number of mosquitoes and limiting exposure to bites.

Treatment of acute dengue is supportive, using either oral or intravenous [[rehydration]] for mild or moderate disease, and [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] and [[blood transfusion]] for more severe cases. The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of dengue fever has increased dramatically since the 1960s, with around 50–100&nbsp;million people infected yearly. Early descriptions of the condition date from 1779, and its viral cause and the transmission were elucidated in the early 20th century. Dengue has become a global problem since the [[World War II|Second World War]] and is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in more than 110&nbsp;countries. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing on a vaccine, as well as medication targeted directly at the virus.

Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an [[RNA virus]] of the family ''[[Flaviviridae]]''; genus ''[[Flavivirus]]''. Other members of the same genus include [[yellow fever|yellow fever virus]], [[West Nile virus]], [[St. Louis encephalitis|St. Louis encephalitis virus]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese encephalitis virus]], [[tick-borne encephalitis virus]], [[Kyasanur forest disease|Kyasanur forest disease virus]], and [[Omsk hemorrhagic fever|Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus]].<ref name=Gould/> Most are transmitted by [[arthropod]]s (mosquitoes or [[tick]]s), and are therefore also referred to as [[arbovirus]]es (''ar''thropod-''bo''rne viruses).<ref name=Gould/>

===Transmission===
[[File:Aedes aegypti biting human.jpg|alt=Close-up photograph of an ''Aedes aegypti'' mosquito biting human skin|thumb|left|The mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' feeding on a human host]]

Dengue virus is primarily transmitted by ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes, particularly ''[[Aedes aegypti|A. aegypti]]''.<ref name=WHOp14>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;14–16.</ref> These mosquitoes usually live between the [[latitude]]s of 35°&nbsp;North and 35°&nbsp;South below an [[elevation]] of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}.<ref name=WHOp14/> They typically bite during the day, particularly in the early morning and in the evening.<ref name=WHOp59/><ref name=WHO2012/> Other ''Aedes'' species that transmit the disease include ''[[Asian tiger mosquito|A. albopictus]]'', ''[[Aedes polynesiensis|A. polynesiensis]]'' and ''[[Aedes scutellaris|A. scutellaris]]''.<ref name=WHOp14/> Humans are the primary [[Host (biology)|host]] of the virus,<ref name=WHOp14/><ref name=Gould/> but it also circulates in nonhuman [[primate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vector-borne viral infections|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/vector/en/index1.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref> An infection can be acquired via a single bite.<ref name=Yellow10>{{cite web|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-5/dengue-fever-dengue-hemorrhagic-fever.aspx|title=Chapter 5 – dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)|work=2010 Yellow Book|author=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2010-12-23}}</ref> A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2–10 day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fauci|first=[edited by] Vassil St. Georgiev ; foreword by Anthony S.|title=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH.|year=2009|publisher=Humana|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-1-60327-297-1|page=268|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=pymSBkVU-FsC&pg=PA268|edition=1}}</ref> About 8–10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's [[salivary gland]]s and is subsequently released into its saliva.

===Predisposition===
Severe disease is more common in babies and young children, and in contrast to many other infections it is more common in children that are relatively well nourished.<ref name=Peads10/> Other [[risk factor]]s for severe disease include female sex, high [[body mass index]],<ref name=NEJM2012/> and [[viral load]].<ref name=Martina09/> While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease,<ref name=Life10/> virus strain is a risk factor.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short term protection against the other three.<ref name=WHOp14/><ref name=Chen/> The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2.<ref name=Guzman10/> Dengue can be life-threatening in people with [[chronic disease]]s such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[asthma]].<ref name=Guzman10/>

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] (normal variations) in particular [[gene]]s have been linked with an increased risk of severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNFα]], [[mannan-binding lectin]],<ref name=White10/> [[CTLA4]], [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGFβ]],<ref name=Life10/> [[DC-SIGN]], [[PLCE1]], and particular [[allele|forms]] of [[human leukocyte antigen]] from gene variations of [[HLA-B]].<ref name=NEJM2012/><ref name=Guzman10/> A common genetic abnormality in Africans, known as [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], appears to increase the risk.<ref name=Martina09>{{cite journal|author=Martina BE, Koraka P, Osterhaus AD|title=Dengue virus pathogenesis: an integrated view|journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev.|volume=22|issue=4|pages=564–81|year=2009|month=October|pmid=19822889|pmc=2772360|doi=10.1128/CMR.00035-09|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/22/4/564}}</ref> Polymorphisms in the genes for the [[Calcitriol receptor|vitamin D receptor]] and [[Fc receptor#Fc-gamma receptors|FcγR]] seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.<ref name=Guzman10/>

==Mechanism==
When a mosquito carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito's saliva.<!-- <ref name=Martina09/> --> It binds to and enters [[white blood cell]]s, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body.<!-- <ref name=Martina09/> --> The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as [[cytokines]] and [[interferons]], which are responsible for many of the symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms and the severe pains.<!-- <ref name=Martina09/> --> In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the [[liver]] and the [[bone marrow]]) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to [[endothelial dysfunction]].<!-- <ref name=Martina09/> --> As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the [[stromal cell]]s leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.<ref name=Martina09/>

===Viral replication===
Once inside the skin, dengue virus binds to [[Langerhans cell]]s (a population of [[dendritic cell]]s in the skin that identifies pathogens).<ref name=Martina09/> The virus [[Receptor-mediated endocytosis|enters the cells]] through binding between viral proteins and [[membrane protein]]s on the Langerhans cell, specifically the [[C-type lectin]]s called DC-SIGN, [[mannose receptor]] and [[CLEC5A]].<ref name=Life10/> DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry.<ref name=Guzman10/> The dendritic cell moves to the nearest [[lymph node]]. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the [[Golgi apparatus]], the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains ([[glycoprotein]]s). The now mature new viruses bud on the surface of the infected cell and are released by [[exocytosis]]. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as [[monocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s.<ref name=Life10/>

The initial reaction of infected cells is to produce interferon, a [[cytokine]] that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the [[innate immune system]] by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK-STAT pathway]]. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the [[adaptive immune system]], which leads to the generation of [[antibody|antibodies]] against the virus as well as [[T cell]]s that directly attack any cell infected with the virus.<ref name=Life10/> Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion by [[phagocyte|specialized cells]] and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.<ref name=Life10/>

===Severe disease===
It is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of [[antibody-dependent enhancement]] (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Life10/><ref name=Guzman10/> There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications,<ref name=White10/> and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the [[complement system]].<ref name=Martina09/>

Severe disease is marked by the problems of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered [[coagulation|blood clotting]].<ref name=India10/><ref name=NEJM2012/><!--NEJM specifies upon the capillary/microvasculature--> These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial [[glycocalyx]], which acts as a [[Molecular sieve|molecular filter]] of blood components.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) are thought to be caused by an immune system response.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Other processes of interest include infected cells that become [[necrosis|necrotic]]—which affect both coagulation and [[fibrinolysis]] (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.<ref name=Martina09/>

===Laboratory tests===
[[File:Dengue testing.png|thumb|When laboratory tests for dengue fever become positive where day zero is the start of symptoms, 1st refers to in those with a primary infection, and 2nd refers to in those with a secondary infection.<ref name=NEJM2012/>]]
The diagnosis of dengue fever may be confirmed by microbiological laboratory testing.<ref name=WHOp10/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wiwanitkit|first=V|title=Dengue fever: diagnosis and treatment.|journal=Expert review of anti-infective therapy|date=2010 Jul|volume=8|issue=7|pages=841–5|pmid=20586568}}</ref> This can be done by virus isolation in [[cell culture]]s, [[Nucleic acid test|nucleic acid detection]] by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], viral [[antigen]] detection (such as for [[NS1 antigen test|NS1]]) or specific [[antibodies]] (serology).<ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=WHOp90>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;90–95.</ref> Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost.<ref name=WHOp90/> Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections.<ref name=NEJM2012/> All tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=Guzman10/> PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days.<ref name=NEJM2012/> In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web|title=New CDC test for dengue approved|url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2012/p0620_dengue_test.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=June 20, 2012}}</ref>

These laboratory tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness with the exception of serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types [[IgG]] and [[IgM]], can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels ([[titre]]s) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus.<ref name=Chen/><ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=Gubler10/> The laboratory test for IgG and IgM antibodies can cross-react with other flaviviruses and may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis.<ref name=NEJM2012/> The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.<ref name=Gubler10>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], p.&nbsp;380.</ref>

==Prevention==
[[File:Vector Control.jpg|alt=A black and white photograph of people filling in a ditch with standing water|thumb|A 1920s photograph of efforts to disperse standing water and thus decrease mosquito populations]]

There are no approved [[vaccine]]s for the dengue virus.<ref name=White10/> Prevention thus depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmits it.<ref name=WHOp59>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;59–60.</ref><ref name=WHOp137>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;137.</ref> The World Health Organization recommends an Integrated Vector Control program consisting of five elements: (1)&nbsp;Advocacy, social mobilization and legislation to ensure that public health bodies and communities are strengthened, (2)&nbsp;collaboration between the health and other sectors (public and private), (3)&nbsp;an integrated approach to disease control to maximize use of resources, (4)&nbsp;evidence-based decision making to ensure any interventions are targeted appropriately and (5)&nbsp;capacity-building to ensure an adequate response to the local situation.<ref name=WHOp59/>

The primary method of controlling ''A. aegypti'' is by eliminating its [[habitat]]s.<ref name=WHOp59/> This is done by emptying containers of water or by adding [[insecticide]]s or [[biological control agent]]s to these areas,<ref name=WHOp59/> although spraying with [[organophosphate]] or [[pyrethroid]] insecticides is not thought to be effective.<ref name=Euro10/> Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effect from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents.<ref name=WHOp59/> People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using [[mosquito net]]ting while resting, and/or the application of [[insect repellent]] ([[DEET]] being the most effective).<ref name=Yellow10/>

==Management==
There are no specific [[antiviral drug]]s for dengue, however maintaining proper fluid balance is important.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Treatment depends on the symptoms, varying from [[oral rehydration therapy]] at home with close follow-up, to hospital admission with administration of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] and/or [[blood transfusion]].<ref name=WHOp32>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;32–37.</ref> A decision for hospital admission is typically based on the presence of the "warning signs" listed in the table above, especially in those with preexisting health conditions.<ref name=Peads10/>

Intravenous hydration is usually only needed for one or two days.<ref name=WHOp32/> The rate of fluid administration is titrated to a [[Urination|urinary output]] of 0.5–1&nbsp;mL/kg/hr, stable [[vital signs]] and normalization of hematocrit.<ref name=Peads10/> Invasive medical procedures such as [[nasogastric intubation]], [[intramuscular injection]]s and arterial punctures are avoided, in view of the bleeding risk.<ref name=Peads10/> [[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) is used for fever and discomfort while [[NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[aspirin]] are avoided as they might aggravate the risk of bleeding.<ref name=WHOp32/> Blood transfusion is initiated early in patients presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a ''decreasing hematocrit'', rather than waiting for the hemoglobin concentration to decrease to some predetermined "transfusion trigger" level.<ref name=WHOp40>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;40–43.</ref> [[Packed red blood cells]] or [[whole blood]] are recommended, while [[platelet]]s and [[fresh frozen plasma]] are usually not.<ref name=WHOp40/>

During the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of [[Hypervolemia|fluid overload]].<ref name=Peads10/> If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed.<ref name=WHOp40/> If a person is outside of the critical phase, a [[loop diuretic]] such as [[furosemide]] may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.<ref name=WHOp40/>

The incidence of dengue increased 30&nbsp;fold between 1960 and 2010.<ref name=WHOp3>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;3.</ref> This increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and [[global warming]].<ref name=White10/> The geographical distribution is around the equator with 70% of the total 2.5&nbsp;billion people living in endemic areas from Asia and the Pacific.<ref name=WHOp3/> In the United States, the rate of dengue infection among those who return from an endemic area with a fever is 3–8%,<ref name=Yellow10/> and it is the second most common infection after malaria to be diagnosed in this group.<ref name=Chen/>

Like most arboviruses, dengue virus is maintained in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts.<ref name=Gubler376/> The viruses are maintained in the forests of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female ''Aedes'' mosquitoes—of species other than ''A. aegypti''—to her offspring and to lower primates.<ref name=Gubler376/> In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted by, the highly domesticated, ''A. aegypti''. In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by ''A. aegypti'' and other species of ''Aedes'' such as ''[[Aedes albopictus|A. albopictus]]''.<ref name=Gubler376/> Both these species have had expanding ranges in the second half of the 20th century.<ref name=NEJM2012/> In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating  dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.<ref name=Gubler376>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], pp.&nbsp;376.</ref> Infections are most commonly acquired in the urban environment.<ref name=Gubler377>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], pp.&nbsp;377.</ref> In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in endemic areas, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America,<ref name=Gubler377/> and might pose a threat to Europe.<ref name=Euro10/>

==History==
The first record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420&nbsp;AD) which referred to a "water poison" associated with flying insects.<ref name=EID06/><ref name=Gubler98>{{cite journal|author=Gubler DJ|title=Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever|journal=Clin.

In 1906, transmission by the ''Aedes'' mosquitoes was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was the second disease (after yellow fever) that was shown to be caused by a virus.<ref name=Henchal>{{cite journal|author=Henchal EA, Putnak JR|title=The dengue viruses|journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev.|volume=3|issue=4|pages=376–96|year=1990|month=October|pmid=2224837|pmc=358169|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/3/4/376|doi=10.1128/CMR.3.4.376}}</ref> Further investigations by [[John Burton Cleland]] and [[Joseph Franklin Siler]] completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.<ref name=Henchal/>

The marked spread of dengue during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]] has been attributed to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the [[Philippines]] in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of [[child mortality]] and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas.<ref name=Gubler98/> Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.<ref name=Gould/>

===Etymology===
The origins of the word "dengue" are not clear, but one theory is that it is derived from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase ''Ka-dinga pepo'', which describes the disease as being caused by an [[evil spirit]].<ref name=EID06/> The Swahili word ''dinga'' may possibly have its origin in the Spanish word ''dengue'', meaning fastidious or careful, which would describe the gait of a person suffering the bone pain of dengue fever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dengue|title=Etymology: dengue|year=2001|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|author=Harper D|accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> However, it is possible that the use of the Spanish word derived from the similar-sounding Swahili.<ref name=EID06>{{cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=Etymologia: dengue|journal=Emerg.
