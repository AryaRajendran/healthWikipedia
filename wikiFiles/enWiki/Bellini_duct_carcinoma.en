'''Bellini duct carcinoma''' ('''BDC''', also known as '''low-grade collecting duct carcinoma'''<ref name="pmid19011562"/> and '''tubulocystic carcinoma'''<ref name="pmid19011562"/>) is a type of [[kidney cancer]] that originates in the [[duct of Bellini]] of the kidney.  It is rare, accounting for 1-3% of all kidney cancers.<ref name="pmid15986594">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  However, BDC does not respond well to [[chemotherapy]] drugs used for renal cell carcinoma, and progresses and spreads more quickly.  One small study reporting 20% survival at 2 years.<ref name="pmid12629344"/>  BDC may be related to [[urothelial carcinoma]] aka [[transitional cell carcinoma]], and case reports of treating BDC as for transitional cell carcinoma indicate some benefit. 

BDC is extremely rare, and thus hard to study. Currently, very few published works compare histopathological and clinical data. Because of this, there is no standard protocol for its diagnosis and treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms are as for [[kidney cancer]].

==History==
BDC was thought to be renal cell carcinoma, until "recently developed techniques of [[lectin]] [[histochemistry]]" helped forward knowledge of kidney duct cancers.<ref name="jjco">{{cite journal |author=O Natsume, S Ozono, T Futami, and M Ohta |year=1997 |title=Bellini duct carcinoma: a case report |journal=Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=107–110 |publisher= |location= |doi=10.1093/jjco/27.2.107 |url=http://jjco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/27/2/107 |accessdate=2008-06-03 |pmid=9152800}}</ref>
