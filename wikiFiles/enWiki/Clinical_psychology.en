'''Clinical psychology''' is an integration of [[science]], theory and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or [[mental illness|dysfunction]] and to promote subjective [[mental health|well-being]] and personal development.<ref name="apa1">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html |title=About Clinical Psychology |work=apa.org |publisher=American Psychological Association, Division 12, Society of Clinical Psychology}}</ref><ref name="plante">{{cite book |last1=Plante |first1=Thomas |authorlink1=Thomas G. Plante |title=Contemporary Clinical Psychology |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley & Sons |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-471-47276-X}}</ref> Central to its practice are [[psychological assessment]] and [[psychotherapy]], although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name="brain">{{cite book |last=Brain |first=Christine |title=Advanced psychology: Applications, issues and perspectives |year=2002 |publisher=Nelson Thornes Ltd |location=Cheltenham, United Kingdom |isbn=0-17-490058-9}}</ref> In many countries, clinical psychology is regulated as a [[health care profession]].

The field is often considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological [[clinic]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] by [[Lightner Witmer]]. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, two main educational models have developed—the [[scientist–practitioner model|Ph.D. scientist–practitioner model]] (requiring a doctoral dissertation and therefore research as well as clinical expertise) and, in the U.S. the [[Doctor of Psychology|Psy.D. practitioner–scholar model]].

Clinical psychologists provide psychotherapy, psychological testing, and diagnosis of mental illness. They generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—[[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]], [[behavior therapy]]/[[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], and [[systems or family therapy]]. Many continue clinical training in post-doctoral programs in which they might specialize in disciplines such as psychoanalytic approaches or child and adolescent treatment modalities.

[[Image:Phrenology1.jpg|thumb|left|Many 18th-century treatments for psychological distress were based on pseudo-scientific ideas, such as [[phrenology]].]]
Although research in psychology is often dated to the opening of the first psychological laboratory by [[Wilhelm Wundt]] in 1879, attempts to create methods for assessing and treating mental distress existed long before. The earliest recorded approaches were a combination of religious, magical, and/or medical perspectives.<ref name="benjamin">{{cite book |last=Benjamin, Jr. |first=Ludy |title=A brief history of modern psychology |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |isbn=978-1-4051-3206-0}}</ref> Early examples of such physicians included [[Patañjali]], [[Padmasambhava]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Clifford |first=Terry |year=1984 |title=Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry: The diamond healing |publisher=Weiser |location=York Beach, Maine}}</ref> [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]], [[Avicenna]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Iqbal |first=Afzal |title=The life and work of Jalaluddin Rumi |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |page=94}}</ref> and [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi-Rumi|Rumi]].<ref>Rumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p. 47.</ref>

In the early 19th century, one could have his or her head examined, literally, using phrenology, the study of personality by the shape of the skull. Other popular treatments included [[physiognomy]]—the study of the shape of the face—and [[mesmerism]], [[Franz Anton Mesmer|Mesmer's]] treatment by the use of [[magnet]]s. [[Spiritualism]] and [[Phineas Quimby]]'s "mental healing" were also popular.<ref name="benjamin2">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143758 |last=Benjamin |first=Ludy |year=2005 |title=A history of clinical psychology as a profession in America (and a glimpse at its future) |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=1 |pages=1–30 |pmid=17716080}}</ref>

While the scientific community eventually rejected these methods, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. That area was already being addressed by the then-developing fields of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] within the [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] movement.<ref name="benjamin"/> It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when [[Sigmund Freud]] was first developing the recent idea of a "[[psychoanalysis|talking cure]]" in [[Vienna]], that the first clinical applications of psychology began.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Early clinical psychology===
[[Image:Witmer.jpg|thumb|[[Lightner Witmer]], the father of modern clinical psychology]]
By the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well-established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for an [[applied psychology]], the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on "pure" science as the only respectable practice.<ref name="benjamin"/> This changed when [[Lightner Witmer]] (1867–1956), a past student of [[Wundt]] and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with [[learning disabilities]].<ref name="heiden">{{cite book |last1=Alessandri |first1=M. |last2=Heiden |first2=Lynda (ed.) |last3=Dunbar-Welter |first3=M. |title=Introduction to clinical psychology |editor2-last=Hersen |editor2-first=Michel |year=1995 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York, NY |chapter=History and overview |isbn=0-306-44877-7}}</ref> Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, ''The Psychological Clinic'', where he coined the term "clinical psychology," which he defined as "the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change."<ref name="compass">{{cite book |last1=Compas |first1=Bruce |last2=Gotlib |first2=Ian |title=Introduction to clinical psychology |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-012491-4}}</ref> The field was slow to follow Witmer's example, but by 1914, there were 26 similar clinics in the US.<ref name="evans">{{cite journal |last=Evans |first=Rand |year=1999 |title=Clinical psychology born and raised in controversy |journal=APA Monitor |volume=30| issue=11 |publisher=American Psychological Association}}</ref>

Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of [[psychiatrist]]s and [[neurologist]]s.<ref name="routh">{{cite book |last=Routh |first=Donald |title=Clinical psychology since 1917: Science, practice, and organization |year=1994 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-306-44452-6}}</ref> However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts grew during [[World War I]] with the development of two intelligence tests, ''Army Alpha'' and ''Army Beta'' (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used to screen large groups of military recruits.<ref name="benjamin2"/><ref name="heiden"/> Due in large part to the success of these tests, assessment became the core function of clinical psychology for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Early professional organizations===
The field began to organize under the name "clinical psychology" in 1917, when [[J. E. Wallace Wallin]] led the founding of the American Association of Clinical Psychology. This only lasted until 1919, after which the [[American Psychological Association]] (founded by [[G. Stanley Hall]] in 1892) developed a section on Clinical Psychology, which offered certification until 1927.<ref name="evans"/> Growth in the field was slow for the next few years when various unconnected psychological organizations came together as the American Association of Applied Psychology in 1930, which would act as the primary forum for psychologists until after World War II when the APA reorganized.<ref name="apa100">{{cite journal |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec99/ss13.html |title=Uniting psychologists for more than 100 years |work=APA Monitor Online |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=30 |issue=11 |deadurl=yes}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> In 1945, the APA created what is now called The Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12), which remains a leading organization in the field. Psychological societies and associations in other English-speaking countries developed similar divisions, including in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===World War II and the integration of treatment===
[[Image:Armypsytest.jpg|right|thumb|The [[US army]] conducts a psychological test developed by clinical psychologists for selection purposes. The image is card IV of the [[Rorschach inkblot test]].]]
When [[World War II]] broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. As soldiers began to return from combat, psychologists started to notice symptoms of psychological trauma labeled "shell shock" (eventually to be termed [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]) that were best treated as soon as possible.<ref name="heiden"/> Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition.<ref name="reisman">{{cite book |last=Reisman |first=John |title=A history of clinical psychology |year=1991 |publisher=Taylor Francis |location=United Kingdom |isbn=1-56032-188-1}}</ref> At the same time, female psychologists (who were excluded from the war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving young mothers advice on child rearing.<ref name="compass"/> After the war, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] in the US made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists to help treat the thousands of veterans needing care. As a consequence, the US went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.<ref name="compass"/>

WWII helped bring dramatic changes to clinical psychology, not just in America but internationally as well. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 scientist–practitioner model, known today as the ''Boulder Model'', for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology.<ref name="routh2">{{cite journal |last=Routh |first=Donald |year=2000 |title=Clinical psychology training: A history of ideas and practices prior to 1946 |journal=American Psychologist |volume=55 |issue=2 |page=236 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.2.236}}</ref> Clinical psychology in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the [[National Health Service]]<ref name="whatis">{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=John |last2=Llewelyn |first2=Susan |title=What is clinical psychology |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0-19-856689-1}}</ref> with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the [[British Psychological Society]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Henry |first=David |year=1959 |title=Clinical psychology abroad |journal=American Psychologist |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=601–04 |doi=10.1037/h0038711}}</ref>

===Development of the Doctor of Psychology degree===
By the 1960s, psychotherapy had become imbedded within clinical psychology, but for many the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the US had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the [[University of Illinois]] starting in 1968.<ref name="murray">Murray, Bridget. (2000). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed1.html The degree that almost wasn't: The PsyD comes of age]. ''Monitor on Psychology'', 31(1).</ref> Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the [[Vail Conference]] on Professional Training in Psychology, the [[Practitioner–Scholar Model]] of Clinical Psychology—or ''Vail Model''—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology ([[Psy.D.]]) degree was recognized.<ref name="norcrosspsyd">Norcross, J. & Castle, P. (2002). [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp Appreciating the Psy.D: The Facts.]{{dead link|date=December 2012}} ''Eye on Psi Chim'', 7(1), 22–26.</ref> Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name="murray"/> Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.<ref name="norcrosspsyd"/>

===A changing profession===
Since the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the US grew from 20,000 to 63,000.<ref>Menninger, Roy and Nemiah, John. (2000). ''American psychiatry after World War II: 1944–1994''. Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press. ISBN 0-88048-866-2</ref> Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade.<ref name="benjamin2"/> Other major changes include the impact of [[managed care]] on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication. Approximately 20% of clinical health psychologists identify themselves as counseling psychologists as well.<ref>Nicholas, D. R., & Stern, M. (2011). Counseling psychology in clinical health psychology: The impact of specialty perspective. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 42(4), 331-337. {{doi|10.1037/a0024197}}</ref>

In the UK psychology is now one of the most popular degree subjects, and over 15,000 people graduate in psychology each year, many with the hope of developing this into a career, although only around 600 places for doctoral training in clinical psychology means there is intense competition for these places.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clinpsy.org.uk/ |title=Information for aspiring clinical psychologists |first= |last= |work=clinpsy.org.uk |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.leeds.ac.uk/chpccp/ |title=Clearing House for Postgraduate Courses in Clinical Psychology |first= |last= |work=leeds.ac.uk |year=2010 [last update] |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref> There is also fierce competition to get into US Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology, with an average acceptance rate of 8%.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_563.aspx |title=Relative Weighting of Admission Variables in Developmental Psychology Doctoral Programs |first=Steven |last1=Walfish |first2=Kara |last2=Turner  |work=psichi.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref>

==Professional practice==
[[Clinical psychologists]] can offer a range of professional services, including:<ref name="compass"/>
* Administer and interpret psychological assessment and testing
* Conduct psychological research
* Consultation (especially for multi-disciplinary teams in mental health settings, such as psychiatric wards and increasingly other healthcare settings, schools and businesses)
* Development of prevention and treatment programs
* Program administration
* Provide expert testimony (forensic psychology)
* Provide psychological/ mental treatment (psychotherapy, or/and psychopharmacology "prescribing  psychologists")
* Teach
In practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Most clinical psychologists who engage in research and teaching do so within a college or university setting. Clinical psychologists may also choose to specialize in a particular field—common areas of specialization, some of which can earn board certification,<ref>American Board of Professional Psychology, [http://www.abpp.org/abpp_certification_specialties.htm Specialty Certification in Professional Psychology -clinical Psychology and Psychopathology]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> include:
* [[Family therapy]] and [[relationship counselling]]
* [[Forensic psychology]]
* [[Health psychology]]
* [[Medical psychology]]
**[[Psychosomatic medicine]]
**[[Clinical neuropsychology]]
* [[Child psychopathology]]
* [[Industrial and organizational psychology|Organization and business]]
* [[School psychology]]
* [[Mental disorder]]s (e.g. [[psychological trauma]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[sleep disorder]]s, [[sexual dysfunction]], [[clinical depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[phobia]], and [[psychosis]]
* [[Sport psychology]]
* [[Gerontology|Geropsychology]]

==Salary and employment of clinical psychologists==
According to BlS.gov, approximately 34% of psychologists are self-employed, mostly in private practices. Median salary of US clinical psychologists was $64,140 in 2008 (bls.gov). The field is projected to grow at an average pace. Doctoral degree holders from a leading university in an applied specialty will face the best prospects. M.A. degree holders will face keen competition for jobs while there will be very limited positions for those with B.A. degrees in the field of psychology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm#outlook |title=Psychologists : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> Average doctoral starting and post-doctoral salaries range from $25,000–90,000.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Training and certification to practice==
[[Image:Penn campus 2.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Pennsylvania]] was the first to offer formal education in clinical psychology.]]
{{Main|Training and licensing of clinical psychologists}}
Clinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practice<ref>[http://www.deakin.edu.au/hmnbs/psychology/pdf-docs/pathways-melb.pdf Pathways to register as a psychologist including clinical psychologist in Australia]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html |title=About clinical psychology |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>

In the US, clinical psychology doctoral programs typically range from five to seven years post-college and require a one year full-time clinical internship and dissertation. There is currently an "internship crisis" in the field (see below). Graduates must also accrue 1–2 years of supervised training post-Ph.D. before licensure in most states (3,000 hours) and need to pass the EPPP (plus, other state exams). About half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in [[scientist-practitioner model|Ph.D.]] programs—a model that emphasizes research—with the other half in Psy.D. programs, which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).<ref name="norcrosspsyd"/> Both models are accredited by the American Psychological Association<ref>APA. (2005). [http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/qrg_doctoral.html Guidelines and Principles for Accreditation of Programs in Professional Psychology: Quick Reference Guide to Doctoral Programs]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}.</ref> and many other English-speaking psychological societies. A smaller number of schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a [[Masters degree]], which usually take two to three years post-Bachelors. In a 2009 survey, median debt related to doctoral education in clinical psychology was $68,000 for clinical Ph.D. recipients and $120,000 for clinical Psy.D. recipients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/workforce/publications/09-doc-empl/index.aspx|title=2009 Doctorate Employment Survey|first1=Daniel|last1=Michalski|first2=Jessica|last2=Kohout|first3=Marlene|last3=Wicherski|first4=Brittany|last4=Hart|work=APA Center for Workforce Studies|date=June 2011|publisher=APA|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>

In the UK, clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (D.Clin.Psych.), which is a practitioner [[doctorate]] with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time salaried program sponsored by the National Health Service (NHS) and based in universities and the NHS. Entry into these programs is highly competitive, and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. It is not unusual for applicants to apply several times before being accepted onto a training course as only about one-fifth of applicants are accepted each year.<ref>Cheshire, K. & Pilgrim, D. (2004). ''A short introduction to clinical psychology.'' London; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. ISBN 0-7619-4768-X</ref> These clinical psychology doctoral degrees are accredited by the [[British Psychological Society]] and the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC). The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. Those who successfully complete clinical psychology doctoral degrees are eligible to apply for registration with the HPC as a clinical psychologist.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the US states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:<ref name="ASPPB">{{cite web |url=http://www.asppb.org/ |title=Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards |accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>
# Graduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree
# Completion of supervised clinical experience or internship
# Passing a written examination and, in some states, an oral examination

All US state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination.<ref name="ASPPB"/> Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained though various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. Clinical psychologists require the psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), [[Licensed Professional Counselor]] (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychotherapyguild.com/disciplines.html |title=Professional Disciplines |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>

In the UK, registration as a clinical psychologist with the Health Professions Council (HPC) is necessary. The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. In the UK the following titles are restricted by law: "registered psychologist" and "practitioner psychologist"; in addition, the specialist title "clinical psychologist" is also restricted by law.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Internship crisis in US clinical psychology programs===
In the US, clinical psychology Ph.D. and Psy.D. programs typically require students to complete a one-year full-time (or two-year part-time) clinical internship in order to graduate. However, there is currently an "internship crisis" as defined by the American Psychological Association, in that approximately 25% of clinical psychology doctoral students are unable to find an internship each year, and only 50% are able to attend an APA-accredited internship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/apags/issues/internship.aspx |title=About the Internship Crisis |work=apa.org |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> This crisis has led to many students (approximately 1,000 each year) re-applying for internship the following year (thus delaying graduation) or completing an unaccredited internship, both of which can have emotional and financial consequences.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Internship demand exceeds supply |journal=Monitor on Psychology |volume= 4 |year=2011| page=13 |publisher=American Psychology Association }}</ref> This internship crisis stems from an increase in the production of psychology students. A recent study found that ~30% of unmatched students stem from 15 degree programs, representing only 4% of all programs participating in the internship match.  These programs enrolled larger cohorts of students than average and 14 of the 15 were PsyD programs. All but one was APA accredited. <ref>Parent M. C. and Williamson, J. B. (2010).  Program disparities in unmatched internship applicants.  Training and education in professional psychology 4(2), 116-120.</ref> The authors argue that it would futile to simply increase internship slots.  Internship slots already have increased over the years and as internship slots have increased, these schools increase production.  Students who do not complete an APA-accredited internship are barred from certain employment settings, such as with the VA Hospitals, and may not be able get licensed in some states.<ref name=appicfaq3>{{cite web |url= http://www.appic.org/Match/FAQs/Applicants/Eligibility-and-Participation#q3|title=Match--FAQs--Applicants--Eligibility and Participation--Should I consider attending a non-accredited or non-APPIC member internship program?|publisher=Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers |work=appic.org |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> Additionally, the majority of post-doctoral fellowships and other employment settings require or prefer the completion of an APA-accredited internship.<ref name=appicfaq3/> The median rate of applicants accepted by APA-accredited internship sites is 5.5%<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/features/2009/match-tips.aspx |title=Internship match tips |first=Sadie F. |last=Dingfelder |publisher=American Psychological Association |work=apa.org |year=2011 |quote=match |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref> and the median internship stipend was $24,218 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.appic.org/Match/MatchStatistics/ApplicantSurvey2011Part1.aspx |title=2011 APPIC Match: Survey of Internship Applicants, Part I: Summary of Survey Results |date=30 May 2011 |publisher=Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers |work=appic.org |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>

==Assessment==
An important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is assessment, and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists utilize this core clinical practice.<ref name="groth">{{cite book |last= Groth-Marnat |first=Gary |title=Handbook of Psychological Assessment |edition=5th |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-470-08358-1}}</ref> Such evaluations are usually conducted in order to gain insight into, and form hypotheses about, psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of these assessments are often used to clarify a person's diagnosis and assist in planning treatments or arranging for services. Methods used to gather information include formal tests, clinical interviews, reviews of past records, and behavioral observations.<ref name="plante"/>

There exist literally hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high [[validity (psychometric)|statistical validity]] (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] (i.e., consistency). These measures generally fall within one of several categories, including the following:
* '''Intelligence & achievement tests''' – These tests are designed to measure certain aspects of cognitive functioning (often referred to as [[intelligence quotient|IQ]]) in comparison to a group of people with similar characteristics (such as age or education). These tests, including the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC-IV]] and [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS-IV]], attempt to measure traits such as general knowledge, verbal comprehension, working memory, attention/concentration, logical reasoning, and visual/spatial perception.<ref name="groth"/> Several of these tests have been shown to accurately predict scholastic achievement and occupational performance, and help to identify a person's cognitive strengths and weaknesses.<ref name="groth"/>
* '''Personality tests''' – These tests aim to describe patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings, and generally fall within two categories: [[objective test|objective]] and [[projective test|projective]]. Objective measures, such as the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI-2]] or the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III|MCMI-III]], are based on forced-choice responses—such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale—and generate scores that can be compared to a normative group. Projective tests, such as the [[Rorschach inkblot test]], use open-ended responses, often based on ambiguous stimuli, to reveal non-conscious psychological dynamics such as motivations and perceptions of the self and the world.<ref name="groth"/>
* '''Neuropsychological tests''' - Tests in this category are often used to evaluate a person's [[cognition|cognitive]] functioning and its relationship to a person's behavior or psychological functioning.<ref name="lezak">{{cite book |last1=Lezak |first1=Muriel D. |last2=Howieson |first2=Diane B. |last3=Loring |first3=David W. |title=Neuropsychological Assessment |edition=4th |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-19-511121-4}}</ref> They are used in a variety of settings, for purposes such as clarifying a diagnosis (especially in distinguishing between psychiatric and neurological symptoms), better understanding the impact of a person's neurological condition on their behavior, treatment planning (especially in [[rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] settings), and for legal questions, such as determining if a person is faking their symptoms (also referred to as [[malingering]]) or if they are capable to stand trial.<ref name="lezak"/>
* '''Clinical interviews''' – Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior and collecting detailed histories. The clinical interview is a vital part of assessment, even when using other formalized measures, as it provides a context in which to understand test results. Psychologists can employ a structured format (such as the [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV|SCID]] or the [[mini-mental state examination|MMSE]]), a semi-structured format (such as a sequence of questions) or an unstructured format to gather information about a person's symptoms and past and present functioning.<ref name="groth"/> Such assessments often include evaluations of general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, memory, thought process, and/or communication.<ref name="groth"/>

===Diagnostic impressions===
{{See also|Mental disorder}}
<!--Deleted image removed: [[Image:DSM-IV.jpg|thumb|[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] published by the [[APA]].]]-->
After assessment, clinical psychologists often provide a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] impression. Many countries use the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD-10) while the US most often uses the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV-TR). Both utilize medical concepts and terms, and state that there are categorical disorders that can be diagnosed by set lists of descriptive criteria.<ref name="jablensky">{{cite journal |last=Jablensky |first=Assen |year=2005 |title=Categories, dimensions and prototypes: Critical issues for psychiatric classification |journal=Psychopathology |volume=38 |issue=4 |page=201 |doi=10.1159/000086092}}</ref> Several new models are being discussed, including a "dimensional model" based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor model]] of personality<ref name="jablensky"/><ref name="widiger">{{cite journal |last=Widiger |first=Thomas |coauthors= Trull, Timothy |year=2007 |title=Plate tectonics in the classification of personality disorder: Shifting to a dimensional model |journal=American Psychologist |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=71–83 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.62.2.71 |pmid=17324033}}</ref> and a "psychosocial model," which would place greater emphasis on changing, intersubjective states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mundt |first1=Christoph |last2=Backenstrass |first2=Matthias |year=2005 |title=Psychotherapy and classification: Psychological, psychodynamic, and cognitive aspects |journal=Psychopathology |volume=38 |issue=4 |page=219 |doi=10.1159/000086096}}</ref> In fact, the [[DSM-5]], which is still being edited, will be using a dimensional approach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/01/dsm.aspx|title=Revising the DSM| first= Rebecca| last=Clay| work=apa.org|date=January 2011| accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> The proponents of these models claim that they would offer greater diagnostic flexibility and clinical utility without depending on the medical concept of illness. However, they also admit that these models are not yet robust enough to gain widespread use, and should continue to be developed.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some clinical psychologists prefer not to use diagnoses and instead use ''[[clinical formulation]]s''—an individualized map of the strengths and difficulties that the patient or client faces, with an emphasis on predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kinderman |first1=P. |last2=Lobban |first2=F. |year=2000 |title=Evolving formulations: Sharing complex information with clients |journal=Psychotherapy |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=307–310}}</ref>

==Clinical theories and interventions==
[[Image:Grouptherapy.jpg|right|frame|Clinical psychologists work with individuals, children, families, couples, or small groups.]]
{{Main|Psychotherapy}}
Psychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.<ref name="plante"/><ref name="gabbard"/>

Clinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a [[psychoanalyst]] might encourage [[free association (psychology)|free association]], while a psychologist trained in [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.<ref name="compass"/>
* Insight – emphasis is on gaining greater understanding of the motivations underlying one's thoughts and feelings (e.g. psychodynamic therapy){{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* Action – focus is on making changes in how one thinks and acts (e.g. [[brief therapy|solution-focused therapy]], cognitive behavioral therapy){{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* In-session – interventions center on the here-and-now interaction between client and therapist (e.g. humanistic therapy, Gestalt therapy){{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* Out-session – a large portion of therapeutic work is intended to happen outside of session (e.g. bibliotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy){{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. brief or long-term therapy).<ref name="gabbard"/><ref name="laroche">La Roche, Martin. (2005). The cultural context and the psychotherapeutic process: Toward a culturally sensitive psychotherapy. ''Journal of Psychotherapy Integration'', 15(2), 169–85</ref>

===Four main schools===
The field is dominated in terms of training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: psychodynamic, humanistic, behavioral/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.<ref name="plante"/>

====Psychodynamic====
{{Main|Psychodynamic psychotherapy}}
The psychodynamic perspective developed out of the [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]]. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious—to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various [[defense mechanisms|defenses]] used to keep them in check.<ref name="gabbard">Gabbard, Glen. (2005). ''Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice'', 4th Ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. ISBN 1-58562-185-4</ref> The essential tools of the psychoanalytic process are the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]] and an examination of the client's [[transference]] towards the therapist, defined as the tendency to take unconscious thoughts or emotions about a significant person (e.g. a parent) and "transfer" them onto another person. Major variations on Freudian psychoanalysis practiced today include [[self psychology]], [[ego psychology]], and [[object relations theory]]. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term ''psychodynamic psychology'', with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client's current psychological state.<ref name="gabbard"/>

====Humanistic====
{{Main|Humanistic psychology}}
Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the [[person-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]] (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and [[existential psychology]] developed by [[Viktor Frankl]] and [[Rollo May]].<ref name="plante"/> Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement: congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding.<ref>McMillan, Michael. (2004). ''The Person-Centred Approach to Therapeutic Change''. London, Thousand Oaks: SAGE Publications. ISBN 0-7619-4868-6</ref> By using [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[intersubjectivity]] and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality.<ref>Rowan, John. (2001). ''Ordinary Ecstasy: The Dialectics of Humanistic Psychology.'' London, UK: Brunner-Routledge. ISBN 0-415-23633-9</ref> This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called ''self-actualization''. According to humanistic thinking,<ref name="Schneider">Schneider, K.; Bugental, J. & Pierson, J. (2001). ''The handbook of humanistic psychology: leading edges in theory, research, and practice,'' 2nd ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. ISBN 978-0-7619-2121-9</ref> each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====Behavioral and cognitive behavioral====
{{Main|Cognitive behavioral therapy|Behavior therapy}}
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed from the combination of [[cognitive therapy]] and [[rational emotive behavior therapy]], both of which grew out of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[behaviorism]]. CBT is based on the theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through ''schemas'' or ''beliefs'') can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being.<ref>Beck, A.; Davis, D. & Freeman, A. (2007). ''Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders'', 2nd Ed. New York: Guilford Press. ISBN 978-1-59385-476-8</ref> There are many techniques used, such as [[systematic desensitization]], [[socratic questioning]], and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including [[dialectical behavior therapy]] and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].<ref>Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies. (2006). Albert Ellis is often referred as the "grandfather" of CBT for his influential work in this field. [http://www.aabt.org/What%20are/What%20Are%20Behavioral%20and%20Cognitive%20Therapies.html What is CBT?]. Retrieved 03-04-2007.</ref>

Behavior therapy is a rich tradition. It is well-researched with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict the way we think and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feed back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase (reinforcement), and sometimes the behavior decreases (punishment). Oftentimes behavior therapists are called [[applied behavior analyst]]s. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[anxiety disorders]]. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well-established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Donohue, W.; Ferguson, K.E. |year=2006 |title=Evidence-based practice in psychology and behavior analysis |url=http://baojournal.com |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–50 |format=PDF}}</ref> Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including [[functional analysis (psychology)]], which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including [[community reinforcement and family training]] for treating addictions, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], [[functional analytic psychotherapy]], [[integrative behavioral couples therapy]] including dialectical behavior therapy and [[behavioral activation]]. In addition, specific techniques such as [[contingency management]] and [[exposure therapy]] have come from this tradition.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====Systems or family therapy====
{{Main|Family therapy}}
Systems or family therapy works with couples and families, and emphasizes family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. The central focus tends to be on interpersonal dynamics, especially in terms of how change in one person will affect the entire system.<ref>Bitter, J. & Corey, G. (2001). "Family Systems Therapy" in Gerald Corey (ed.), ''Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy''. Belmost, CA: Brooks/Cole.</ref> Therapy is therefore conducted with as many significant members of the "system" as possible. Goals can include improving communication, establishing healthy roles, creating alternative narratives, and addressing problematic behaviors. Contributors include [[John Gottman]], [[Jay Haley]], [[Sue Johnson]], and [[Virginia Satir]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Other major therapeutic orientations===
{{See also|List of psychotherapies}}
There exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy—the list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client.
* '''Existential''' – [[Existential psychotherapy]] postulates that people are largely free to choose who we are and how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client's ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.<ref>Van Deurzen, Emmy. (2002). ''Existential Counseling & Psychotherapy in Practice.'' London; Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. ISBN 0-7619-6223-9</ref> Important writers in existential therapy include [[Rollo May]], [[Viktor Frankl]], [[James Bugental]], and [[Irvin Yalom]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

One influential therapy that came out of existential therapy is [[Gestalt therapy]], primarily founded by [[Fritz Perls]] in the 1950s. It is well known for techniques designed to increase various kinds of self-awareness—the best-known perhaps being the "empty chair technique"—which are generally intended to explore resistance to "authentic contact," resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete "unfinished business."<ref name="woldt">Woldt, Ansel & Toman, Sarah. (2005). ''Gestalt Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. ISBN 0-7619-2791-3</ref>

* '''Postmodern''' – Postmodern psychology says that the experience of reality is a subjective construction built upon language, social context, and history, with no essential truths.<ref>Slife, B.; Barlow, S. & Williams, R. (2001). ''Critical issues in psychotherapy: translating new ideas into practice''. London: SAGE. ISBN 0-7619-2080-3</ref> Since "mental illness" and "mental health" are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist.<ref>Blatner, Adam. (1997). [http://www.blatner.com/adam/level2/pmodpsy198.htm The Implications of Postmodernism for Psychotherapy]. ''Individual Psychology'', 53(4), 476–82.</ref> Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include [[narrative therapy]], [[solution-focused therapy]], and [[coherence therapy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

* '''Transpersonal''' – The [[transpersonal psychology|transpersonal perspective]] places a stronger focus on the [[spirituality|spiritual]] facet of human experience.<ref>Boorstein, Seymour. (1996). ''Transpersonal Psychotherapy.'' Albany: State University of New York Press. ISBN 0-7914-2835-4</ref> It is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] states of consciousness. It also is concerned with helping clients achieve their highest potential. Important writers in this area include [[Ken Wilber]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Stanislav Grof]], [[John Welwood]], [[David Brazier]] and [[Roberto Assagioli]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Other perspectives===
* '''Multiculturalism''' – Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration.<ref name="laroche"/> Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of [[acculturation]] can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice.<ref>Young, Mark. (2005). ''Learning the Art of Helping'', 3rd ed. Ch. 4, "Helping Someone Who is Different." Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education. ISBN 0-13-111753-X</ref> As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.<ref name="price">Price, Michael. (2008). Culture matters: Accounting for clients' backgrounds and values makes for better treatment. ''Monitor on Psychology'', 39(7), 52–53.</ref>

* '''Feminism''' – [[Feminist therapy]] is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.<ref>Hill, Marcia and Ballou, Mary. (2005). ''The foundation and future of feminist therapy''. New York: Haworth Press. ISBN 0-7890-0201-9</ref>

* '''Positive psychology''' – [[Positive psychology]] is the scientific study of human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of [[Martin Seligman]],<ref>Seligman, Martin and Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly. (2000). Positive psychology: An introduction. ''American Psychologist'', 55(1), 5–14.</ref> then president of the APA. The [[history of psychology]] shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing [[mental illness]] rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology's main focus, therefore, is to increase one's positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as optimism about the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism.<ref>Snyder, C. & Lopez, S. (2001). ''Handbook of Positive Psychology''. New York; Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-513533-4</ref><ref>Linley, Alex et al. (2006). Positive psychology: Past, present, and (possible) future. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology'', 1(1), 3–16.</ref> There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman's three components of happiness—positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)—positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.<ref>Seligman, M.; Rashid, T. & Parks, A. (2006). Positive Psychotherapy. ''American Psychologist'', 61(8), 774–88.</ref>

===Integration===
{{Main|Integrative psychotherapy}}
In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as [[neuroscience]], [[genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[psychopharmacology]]. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.<ref>Norcross, John & Goldfried, Marvin. (2005). The Future of Psychotherapy Integration: A Roundtable. ''Journal of Psychotherapy Integration'', 15(4), 392.</ref>

==Professional ethics==
The field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. In the US, professional ethics are largely defined by the APA ''Code of Conduct'', which is often used by states to define licensing requirements. The APA Code generally sets a higher standard than that which is required by law as it is designed to guide responsible behavior, the protection of clients, and the improvement of individuals, organizations, and society.<ref name="apa3">APA. (2003). [http://www.apa.org/ethics/code2002.html Ethical ''Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct'']{{dead link|date=December 2012}}. Retrieved July 28, 2007.</ref> The Code is applicable to all psychologists in both research and applied fields. The APA Code is based on five principles: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence, Fidelity and Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, and Respect for People's Rights and Dignity.<ref name="apa3"/> Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The BPS ''Code of Ethics and Conduct'' similarly sets a high standard for psychologist. It is based on four principles: respect, competence, responsibility and integrity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/code_of_ethics_and_conduct.pdf|format=PDF|title=Code of Ethics and Conduct|publisher=British Psychological Society|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>

==Comparison with other mental health professions==
{{See also|Mental health professional}}

===Psychiatry===
[[File:Prozac.jpg|thumb|[[Fluoxetine hydrochloride]], branded by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]] as Prozac, is a common [[antidepressant]] [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] prescribed by psychiatrists. There is a small but growing movement to give prescription privileges to qualified psychologists.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}]]
Although clinical psychologists and psychiatrists can be said to share a same fundamental aim—the treatment of mental disorders—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the [[medical model]] to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on [[psychotropic medication]]s as the chief method of addressing the illness<ref>Graybar, S. & Leonard, L. (2005), ''American Journal of Psychotherapy'', 59(1), 1–19.</ref>—although many employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists and [[medical psychologist]]s (who are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and [[EEG]]s, and may order brain imaging studies such as [[CT scan|CT]] or [[CAT scan|CAT]]; [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]; and [[positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Clinical psychologists generally do not [[medical prescription|prescribe]] medication, although there is a movement for psychologists to have [[prescriptive authority for psychologists movement|prescribing privileges]].<ref>Klusman, Lawrence. (2001). Prescribing Psychologists and Patients' Medical Needs; Lessons From Clinical Psychiatry. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 32(5), 496.</ref> These medical privileges require additional training and education. To date, medical psychologists may prescribe psychotropic medications in [[Guam]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Louisiana]], as well as United States military psychologists.<ref>Halloway, Jennifer. (2004). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/gaining.html Gaining prescriptive knowledge]. ''Monitor on Psychology'', 35(6), 22.</ref> Psychologists usually receive more thorough training in research methods, psychological assessment, and psychotherapeutic  treatment, compared with psychiatrists.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Counseling psychology===
[[Counseling psychologist]]s study and use many of the same interventions and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists help people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events.<ref name="brain"/><ref name="compass"/> Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling, although some counseling psychologists also work with the more serious problems that clinical psychologists are trained for, such as [[dementia]] or [[psychosis]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

There are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. The two professions can be found working in all the same settings but counseling psychologists are more frequently employed in university counseling centers compared to hospitals and private practice for clinical psychologists.<ref>Norcross, John. (2000). [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_73.asp Clinical versus counseling psychology: What's the diff?]{{dead link|date=December 2012}} ''Eye on Psi Chi'', 5(1), 20–22.</ref>

===School psychology===
{{Mentalhealthprofessionals}}
[[School psychologist]]s are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. In the UK, they are known as "educational psychologists." They typically hold a master's degree.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Like clinical psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Common degrees include the [[Educational Specialist|Educational Specialist Degree]] (Ed.S.), [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.), and [[Doctor of Education]] (Ed.D.).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Traditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.<ref>Silva, Arlene. (2003). ''[http://www.nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx Who Are School Psychologists?]''. National Association of School Psychologists.</ref><ref>American Psychological Association (n.d.). ''[http://www.apa.org/crsppp/schpsych.html Archival Description of School Psychology]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}''. American Psychological Association.</ref>

===Clinical social work===
[[Social work]]ers provide a variety of services, generally concerned with social problems, their causes, and their solutions. With specific training, clinical social workers may also provide psychological counseling (in the US and Canada), in addition to more traditional social work. The Masters in Social Work in the US is a two-year, sixty credit program that includes a practicum each year, totaling at least 900 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards|url=http://www.cswe.org/File.aspx?id=13780|publisher=Council on Social Work Education|accessdate=12 September 2012|page=16|year=2008}}</ref>  Two additional years of supervision is required to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker which offers similar privileges to that of a psychologist but cannot provide diagnosis, testing, and, in some cases, are unable to bill for services.

===Occupational therapy===
[[Occupational therapy]]—often abbreviated OT—is the "use of productive or creative activity in the treatment or rehabilitation of physically, cognitively, or emotionally disabled people."<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition''. (2000). [http://www.bartleby.com/61/19/O0021900.html "Occupational Therapy."]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, [[cognitive]] and environmental components of illness and injury. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT's use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities. In chronic pain management, occupational therapists use the common cognitive behavioral therapy approach, often incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy techniques and helping clients generalize or integrate their pain management strategies into their lives. In this way, occupational therapists both support and extend the work that clinical psychologists carry out in a clinical setting.<ref>Persson, E.; Rivano-Fischer, M. & Eklun, M. (2004). Evaluation of changes in occupational performance among patients in a pain management program. ''Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine'', 36(2), 85–91.</ref>

==Criticisms and controversies==
Clinical psychology is a diverse field and there have been recurring tensions over the degree to which clinical practice should be limited to treatments supported by empirical research.<ref name="observing">Pilgram, D. & Treacher, A. (1992) Clinical Psychology Observed. Routledge: London & USA/Canada. ISBN 0-415-04632-7</ref> Despite some evidence showing that all the major therapeutic orientations are about of equal effectiveness,<ref>Leichsenring, Falk & Leibing, Eric. (2003).

''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology''. New York: Guilford Press. ISBN 1-57230-828-1</ref>

It has been reported that clinical psychology has rarely allied itself with [[Psychiatric survivors movement|client groups]] and tends to individualize problems to the neglect of wider economic, political and social inequality issues that may not be the responsibility of the client.<ref name="observing"/> It has been argued that therapeutic practices are inevitably bound up with power inequalities, which can be used for good and bad.<ref>Kyuken, W.
