The '''levator palpebrae superioris''' (Latin for: '''elevating muscle of upper eyelid''') is the [[muscle]] in the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] that elevates the superior (upper) [[eyelid]].

==Structure==
The levator palpebrae superioris originates on the lesser wing of the [[sphenoid bone]], just above the [[optic foramen]].  It broadens and becomes the levator aponeurosis.  This portion inserts on the skin of the upper eyelid, as well as the superior [[tarsal plate]]. It is a [[skeletal muscle]].  The [[superior tarsal muscle]], a smooth muscle, is attached to the levator palpebrae superioris, and inserts on the superior tarsal plate as well.

==Innervation==
As with most of the muscles of the orbit, it is [[innervation|innervated]] by the superior division of the [[oculomotor nerve]] (Cranial Nerve III).  This is why, when one turns one's eye upward, the eyelid tends to rise with it.<ref>"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 5 Apr. 2008</ref>  An adjoining smooth muscle, the [[superior tarsal muscle]], is sympathetically innervated and is occasionally considered to be part of the levator palpebrae superioris.

==Actions==
The levator palpebrae superioris muscle elevates and retracts the upper eyelid.

==Pathology==
Damage to this muscle, or its innervation, can cause [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], the drooping of the eyelid.  Ptosis can also be caused by damage to the adjoining [[superior tarsal muscle]], or its sympathetic innervation. Such damage to the sympathetic supply occurs in [[Horner's syndrome]], and presents as a partial ptosis.
