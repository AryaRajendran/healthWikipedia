'''Penile cancer''' is a malignant growth found on the skin or in the tissues of the [[penis]].

==Prevalence==
Penile cancer is a rare cancer in [[developed nations]]. The annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is approximately 1 in 100,000 men in the United States,<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/PenileCancer/DetailedGuide/penile-cancer-key-statistics The American Cancer Society: Penile Cancer: What is penile cancer?] [[American Cancer Society]], Last revised: January 8, 2012</ref> 1 in 250,000 in Australia,<ref>[www.racp.edu.au The Official Website of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians], Published September 2010</ref> and 0.82 per 100,000 in Denmark.<ref>Frisch M, Friis S, Kjær SK, Melbye M.

==Risk factors and prevention==
*[[Acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) - AIDS can increase a man's risk of developing penile cancer.<ref name="acs-risk">[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/PenileCancer/DetailedGuide/penile-cancer-risk-factors The American Cancer Society: Penile Cancer: "What are the risk factors for penile cancer?"] [[The American Cancer Society]]</ref> AIDS can be prevented by practicing [[safe sex]] or by not having sex with a person who is positive for HIV/AIDS.

*Age - Penile cancer is rarely seen in men under the age of 50. About 4 out of 5 men diagnosed with penile cancer are over the age of 55.<ref name="acs-risk"/>

*[[Balanitis]] - Balanitis is inflammation of the [[foreskin]] and/or the [[glans penis]].<ref name="pubmedhealth"/> It is associated with increased risk of penile cancer.<ref name="pow-sang-2010"/> It is usually caused by poor hygiene, [[allergic reactions]] to certain [[soaps]], or an underlying health condition such as [[reactive arthritis]], infection, or [[diabetes]].<ref name="pubmedhealth"/> Balanitis can be prevented by washing the penis regularly with water and by avoiding soaps with harsh ingredients.

*[[Circumcision]] - Some studies show that circumcision during infancy or in childhood may provide partial protection against penile cancer, but this is not the case when performed in adulthood.<ref name="larke-2010">{{cite journal |author=Larke NL, Thomas SL, dos Santos Silva I, Weiss HA |title=Male circumcision and penile cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1097–110 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21695385 |pmc=3139859 |doi=10.1007/s10552-011-9785-9 |url=}}</ref> It has been suggested that the reduction in risk may be due to reduced risk of [[phimosis]];<ref name="acs-risk"/><ref name="larke-2010"/> other possible mechanisms include reduction in risk of [[smegma]] and [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]] infection.<ref name="acs-risk"/> Several authors have proposed circumcision as a possible strategy for penile cancer prevention;<ref name="bleeker-2009">{{cite journal |author=Bleeker MC, Heideman DA, Snijders PJ, Horenblas S, Dillner J, Meijer CJ |title=Penile cancer: epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention |journal=World J Urol |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=141–50 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=18607597 |doi=10.1007/s00345-008-0302-z |url=}}</ref><ref name="minhas-2010"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=de Souza KW, dos Reis PE, Gomes IP, de Carvalho EC |title=[Prevention strategies for testicular and penile cancer: an integrative review] |language=Portuguese |journal=Rev Esc Enferm USP |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=277–82 |year=2011 |month=March |pmid=21445520 |doi= |url=}}</ref> however, the American Cancer Society points to the rarity of the disease and notes that neither the American Academy of Pediatrics nor the Canadian Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine neonatal circumcision.<ref name="acs-risk"/>

Like many malignancies, penile cancer can spread to other parts of the body. It is usually a primary malignancy, the initial place from which a cancer spreads in the body. Much less often it is a secondary malignancy, one in which the cancer has spread to the penis from elsewhere. The staging of penile cancer is determined by the extent of tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis. The [[AJCC]] staging guidelines are as follows:<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/penile/HealthProfessional/page3</ref>

*Stage I - The cancer is moderately or well differentiated and only affects the subepithelial connective tissue.
*Stage II - The cancer is poorly differentiated, affects lymphatics, or invades the corpora or urethra.
*Stage IIIa - There is deep invasion into the penis and metastasis in one lymph node.
*Stage IIIb - There is deep invasion into the penis and metastasis into multiple inguinal lymph nodes
*Stage IV - The cancer has invaded into structures adjacent to the penis, metastasized to pelvic nodes, or distant metastasis is present.

Prognosis can range considerably for patients, depending where on the scale they have been staged. Generally speaking, the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the better the prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rate for all stages of penile cancer is about 50%.

==Treatment==
There are several treatment options for penile cancer, depending on staging. They include [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[biological therapy]]. The most common treatment is one of five types of surgery:
*[[Wide local excision]] - The tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed
*[[Microsurgery]] - Surgery performed with a microscope is used to remove the tumor and as little healthy tissue as possible
*[[Laser surgery]] - laser light is used to burn or cut away cancerous cells
*[[Circumcision]] - cancerous foreskin is removed
*Amputation ([[penectomy]]) - a partial or total removal of the penis, and possibly the associated [[lymph nodes]].  

[[Radiation therapy]] is usually used adjuvantly with surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. With earlier stages of penile cancer, a combination of topical [[chemotherapy]] and less invasive surgery may be used. More advanced stages of penile cancer usually require a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
In addition to all the above, treatment of the underlying disease like brucellosis,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}<!--is there a citation to confirm this asserted causality?--> is important to limit disease recurrence.
