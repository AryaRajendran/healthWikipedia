'''Cervical dilation'''  (or cervical dilatation) is the opening of the [[cervix]], the entrance to the uterus, during [[childbirth]], [[miscarriage]], [[abortion|induced abortion]], or gynecological surgery.  Cervical dilation may occur naturally, or may be induced by surgical or medical means.

== Childbirth ==
In the later stages of pregnancy, the cervix may already have opened up to 1–3&nbsp;cm (or more in rarer circumstances), but during [[childbirth|labor]], repeated [[uterine contraction]]s lead to further widening of the cervix to about 6 centimeters.  From that point, pressure from the presenting part (head in vertex births or bottom in breech births), along with uterine contractions, will dilate the cervix to 10 centimeters, which is "complete." Cervical dilation is accompanied by [[effacement]], the thinning of the cervix.

General guidelines for cervical dilation:<ref>{{cite web | last = Rodriguez | first = Lisa | coauthors = Marjorie Greenfield | title = Examination during Labor | publisher = DrSpock.com | date = 14 August 2004 | url = http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,6234,00.html | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}</ref>
* Latent phase: 0-3 centimeters
* Active Labor: 4-7 centimeters
* Transition: 8-10 centimeters
* Complete: 10 centimeters. Delivery of the infant takes place shortly after this stage is reached (although the mother does not always push right away.)

=== Symptoms ===
During [[pregnancy]], the os (opening) of the cervix is blocked by a thick plug of [[mucus]] to prevent bacteria from entering the uterus. During dilation, this plug is loosened. It may come out as one piece, or as thick mucus discharge from the vagina. When this occurs, it is an indication that the cervix is beginning to dilate, although not all women will notice this mucus plug being released. 

[[Bloody show]] is another indication that the cervix is dilating. Bloody show usually comes along with the mucus plug, and may continue throughout labor, making the mucus tinged pink, red or brown. Fresh, red blood is usually not associated with dilation, but rather serious complications such as [[placental abruption]], or [[placenta previa]].  Red blood in small quantities often also follows an exam.

The pain experienced during dilation is similar to that of [[menstruation]] (although markedly more intense), as period pains are thought to be due to the passing of [[endometrium]] through the cervix. Most of the pain during labor is caused by the uterus contracting to dilate the cervix.

=== Induced dilation in childbirth===
[[Prostaglandin]]s (P2 and [[Prostaglandin E2|PGE2]]) contribute to cervical ripening and dilation. The body produces these hormones naturally. Sometimes prostaglandins in synthesized forms are applied directly to the cervix to induce labor.<!--

Other means of natural cervical ripening include [[nipple stimulation]], which produces [[oxytocin]], an organic hormone which is necessary for uterine contractions. Nipple stimulation can be performed manually, by use of a [[breast pump]], or by suckling. Henci Goer, in her comprehensive book, The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth, details how this practice was researched in two separate studies of 100 and 200 women in the mid nineteen-eighties. Women were assigned randomly to two groups. In one group, nipples were stimulated for one hour sessions, three times per day. In the other group, women were to avoid any form of nipple stimulation or sexual intercourse. The researchers concluded in both studies that nipple stimulation could indeed ripen the cervix and in some cases induce [[uterine contractions]]. Goer further notes that in the smaller study, an [[external fetal monitor]] was used, and no [[uterine hyperstimulation]] was noted.<ref>The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer,1999,ISBN 0-399-52517-3</ref>{{unreliable source|failed=y|date=August 2012}}

Cervical dilation may be induced mechanically by placing devices inside the cervix that will expand while in place.  A [[balloon catheter]] may be used.  Other products include [[laminaria]] (made of dried seaweed) or synthetic [[hygroscopic]] materials, which expand when placed in a moist environment.<ref name="eMed" />

== In hysteroscopy==
{{anchor|dilator}}
In [[hysteroscopy]], the diameter of the hysteroscope is generally too large to conveniently pass the [[cervix]] directly, thereby necessitating cervical dilation to be performed prior to insertion. Cervical dilation can be performed by temporarily stretching the cervix with a series of ''(cervical) dilators'' of increasing diameter.<ref>[http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/laparoscopy.pdf Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy.] A Guide for Patients, Revised 2012.
