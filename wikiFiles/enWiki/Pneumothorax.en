A '''pneumothorax''' (''pl''. '''pneumothoraces''') is an abnormal collection of air or gas in the [[pleural space]] that separates the [[lung]] from the [[chest wall]] and which may interfere with normal [[breathing]].

A '''primary pneumothorax''' is one that occurs without an apparent cause and in the absence of significant lung [[disease]], while a '''secondary pneumothorax''' occurs in the presence of existing lung [[pathology]]. Occasionally, the amount of air in the chest increases markedly when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], leading to a '''tension pneumothorax'''. This condition is a [[medical emergency]] that can cause steadily worsening [[Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen shortage]] and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]. Unless reversed by effective treatment, these [[sequelae]] can progress and cause death.

Pneumothoraces can be caused by [[physical trauma]] to the [[chest]] (including [[blast injury]]), or as a [[iatrogenesis|complication of medical or surgical intervention]]. [[Symptom]]s typically include [[chest pain]] and [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]]. [[Medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] of a pneumothorax by [[physical examination]] alone can be [[Differential diagnosis|difficult or inconclusive]] (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces), so a [[chest]] [[radiograph|X-ray]] or [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]] (CT) scan is usually used to confirm its presence.

Small spontaneous pneumothoraces typically resolve without treatment and require only monitoring. This approach may be most appropriate in subjects who have no significant underlying lung disease. In larger pneumothoraces, or when there are marked [[Medical sign|symptoms]], the air may be extracted with a [[syringe]] or a [[chest tube]] connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, [[surgery|surgical]] interventions are required when tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve [[pleurodesis]] (in which the layers of [[pleura]] are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes).

==Signs and symptoms==

===Clinical features===
A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) tends to occur in a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features.<ref name=Tschopp>{{cite journal |author=Tschopp JM, Rami-Porta R, Noppen M, Astoul P |title=Management of spontaneous pneumothorax: state of the art |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=637–50 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16946095 |doi=10.1183/09031936.06.00014206 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/28/3/637.long}}</ref><ref name=Noppen>{{cite journal |author=Noppen M, De Keukeleire T |title=Pneumothorax |journal=Respiration |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=121–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18708734 |doi=10.1159/000135932 | url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowFulltext&ArtikelNr=000135932&Ausgabe=238708&ProduktNr=224278}}</ref> People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention.<ref name=BTS>{{cite journal |author=MacDuff A, Arnold A, Harvey J, BTS Pleural Disease Guideline Group |title=Management of spontaneous pneumothorax: [[British Thoracic Society]] pleural disease guideline 2010 |journal=Thorax |volume=65 |issue=8|pages=ii18–ii31 |year=2010|month=December|doi=10.1136/thx.2010.136986|pmid=20696690}}</ref> PSPs more commonly occur during changes in [[atmospheric pressure]], explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters.<ref name=Noppen/> It is rare for  PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.<ref name=Tschopp/>

Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, occur in individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs tend to be more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. [[Hypoxemia]] (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as [[cyanosis]] (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). [[Hypercapnia]] (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause [[mental confusion|confusion]] and - if very severe - may result in [[coma]]s. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[cystic fibrosis]], or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=BTS/>

Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs  when the chest wall is pierced, such as when a [[stabbing|stab wound]] or [[ballistic trauma|gunshot wound]] allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only [[rib fracture]]s being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if [[mechanical ventilation]] is required.<ref name=Noppen/> They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.<ref name=Noppen/>

Upon [[physical examination]], [[respiratory sounds|breath sounds]] (audible using a [[stethoscope]]) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because air in the pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations to the surface of the chest may be altered. [[Percussion (medicine)|Percussion]] of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and [[vocal resonation|vocal resonance]] and [[fremitus|tactile fremitus]] can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited [[correlation]] with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim,<ref name=BTS/> and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.<ref name=Noppen/><ref name=BTS/>

===Tension pneumothorax===
Although multiple definitions exist, a tension pneumothorax is generally considered to be present when a pneumothorax leads to significant impairment of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and/or [[perfusion|blood circulation]].<ref name=Leigh-Smith>{{cite journal |author=Leigh-Smith S, Harris T |title=Tension pneumothorax—time for a re-think? |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=8–16 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15611534 |pmc=1726546 |doi=10.1136/emj.2003.010421}}</ref> The most common findings in people with tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased [[heart rate]] ([[tachycardia]]) and rapid breathing ([[tachypnea]]) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds on one side of the chest, low [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygen levels]] and [[blood pressure]], and displacement of the [[human trachea|windpipe]] away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be [[cyanosis]] (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), [[altered level of consciousness]], a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the [[epigastrium]] (upper abdomen), displacement of the [[apex beat]] (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the [[sternum]].<ref name=Leigh-Smith/> This is a [[medical emergency]] and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).<ref name=BTS/><ref name=Leigh-Smith/>

Tension pneumothorax may also occur in someone who is receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case it may be difficult to spot as the person is typically receiving [[sedation]]; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition.<ref name=Leigh-Smith/> Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised [[jugular venous pressure]] (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.<ref name=Leigh-Smith/>

==Cause==

===Primary spontaneous===
Spontaneous pneumothoraces are divided into two types: ''primary'', which occurs in the absence of known lung disease, and ''secondary'', which occurs in someone with underlying lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, [[smoking]], and a [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of pneumothorax.<ref name=Rosen2010/> The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed [[#Mechanism|below]].<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=Noppen/>

===Secondary spontaneous===
Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the setting of a variety of lung diseases. The most common is [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), which accounts for approximately 70% of cases.<ref name=Rosen2010/> Known lung diseases that may significantly increase the risk for pneumothorax are

In children, additional causes include [[measles]], [[echinococcosis]], inhalation of a [[foreign body]], and certain [[congenital malformation]]s ([[congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation]] and [[congenital lobar emphysema]]).<ref name=Robinson>{{cite journal |author=Robinson PD, Cooper P, Ranganathan SC |title=Evidence-based management of paediatric primary spontaneous pneumothorax |journal=Paediatric Respiratory Reviews |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=110–7|year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19651381 |doi=10.1016/j.prrv.2008.12.003}}</ref>

11.5% of people with a spontaneous pneumothorax have a family member who has previously experienced a pneumothorax. The hereditary conditions--[[Marfan syndrome]], [[homocystinuria]], [[Ehlers&ndash;Danlos syndrome]], [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] (which leads to emphysema), and [[Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome]]--have all been linked to familial pneumothorax.<ref name=Chiu>{{cite journal |author=Chiu HT, Garcia CK |title=Familial spontaneous pneumothorax |journal=Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=268–72 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16825879 |doi=10.1097/01.mcp.0000230630.73139.f0}}</ref> Generally, these conditions cause other signs and symptoms as well, and pneumothorax is not usually the primary finding.<ref name=Chiu/> Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome is caused by mutations in the ''FLCN'' [[gene]] (located at [[chromosome]] 17p11.2), which encodes a protein named [[folliculin]].<ref name=Robinson/><ref name=Chiu/> ''FLCN'' mutations and lung lesions have also been identified in familial cases of pneumothorax where other features of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are absent.<ref name=Robinson/> In addition to the genetic associations, the [[human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] [[haplotype]] A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>40</sub> is also a genetic predisposition to PSP.<ref name="Fishman1520">{{Cite book | author=Levine DJ, Sako EY, Peters J | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=1520 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref><ref name="Light307">{{Cite book | author=Light RW | title=Pleural diseases | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year=2007 | page=307 | edition=5th | isbn=0-7817-6957-4 }}</ref>

===Traumatic===
A traumatic pneumothorax may result from either [[blunt trauma]] or [[Penetrating trauma|penetrating injury]] to the chest wall.<ref name=Noppen/> The most common mechanism is due to the penetration of sharp bony points at a new [[rib fracture]], which damages lung tissue.<ref name=Rosen2010>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |author=Marx J |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |pages=393–396}}</ref> Traumatic pneumothorax may also be observed in those [[blast injury|exposed to blasts]], even though there is no apparent injury to the chest.<ref name=Wolf>{{cite journal |author=Wolf SJ, Bebarta VS, Bonnett CJ, ''et al'' |title=Blast injuries |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9687 |pages=405–15 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19631372 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60257-9}}</ref>

Medical procedures, such as the insertion of a [[central venous catheter]] into one of the chest veins or the taking of [[biopsy]] samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of [[positive pressure ventilation]], either [[mechanical ventilation]] or [[non-invasive ventilation]], can result in [[barotrauma]] (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.<ref name=Noppen/>

[[Underwater diving|Divers]] who breathe from an underwater apparatus are supplied with breathing gas at [[ambient pressure]], which results in their lungs containing gas at higher than atmospheric pressure. Divers breathing compressed air (such as when [[scuba diving]]) may suffer a pneumothorax as a result of [[barotrauma]] from ascending just {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} while breath-holding with their lungs fully inflated.<ref name=BE2003>{{cite book |title=Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving, 5th Rev ed |editor=Brubakk AO, Neuman TS |year=2003 |publisher=Saunders |location=United States |isbn=0-7020-2571-2 |author=Neuman TS |chapter=Arterial gas embolism and pulmonary barotrauma |pages=558–561}}</ref> An additional problem in these cases is that those with other features of [[decompression sickness]] are typically treated in a [[diving chamber]] with [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric therapy]]; this can lead to a small pneumothorax rapidly enlarging and causing features of tension.<ref name=BE2003/>

==Mechanism==
[[File:Pneumothorax CT.jpg|thumb|alt=Image from a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. On the right (left side of the patient) there is a black area suggesting free air inside the chest|[[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of the chest showing a pneumothorax on the person's left side (right side on the image).  A [[chest tube]] is in place (small black mark on the right side of the image), the air-filled [[pleural cavity]] (black) and [[ribs]] (white) can be seen. The [[heart]] can be seen in the center.]]

The [[thoracic cavity]] is the space inside the chest that contains the lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On each side of the cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung ([[visceral pleura]]) and also lines the inside of the chest wall ([[parietal pleura]]). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating [[serous fluid]]. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space.<ref name=Noppen/> Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because [[microorganism]]s in the pleural space produce gas.<ref name=Noppen/>

Chest-wall defects are usually evident in cases of injury to the chest wall, such as stab or bullet wounds ("open pneumothorax"). In secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces, vulnerabilities in the [[parenchyma|lung tissue]] are caused by a variety of disease processes, particularly by rupturing of bullae (large air-containing lesions) in cases of severe emphysema. Areas of [[necrosis]] (tissue death) may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax, although the exact mechanism is unclear.<ref name=Tschopp/> Primary spontaneous pneumothorax has for many years been thought to be caused by "[[Bleb (medicine)|blebs]]" (small air-filled lesions just under the pleural surface), which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax (tall males) due to mechanical factors. Various lines of evidence suggest that this hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, such as the fact that pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs, and that blebs occur in 15% of healthy people. It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption (porosity) in the pleural layer, which are prone to rupture.<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=Noppen/> Smoking may additionally lead to [[inflammation]] and [[chronic bronchitis|obstruction]] of [[bronchioles|small airways]], which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers.<ref name=BTS/> Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity, it is gradually reabsorbed .<ref name=BTS/>

Tension pneumothorax occurs when the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the [[respiratory rate]] and [[tidal volume]] (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and [[respiratory arrest]] eventually follow.<ref name=Leigh-Smith/>

==Diagnosis==
The symptoms of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially in those with a small PSP; confirmation with [[medical imaging]] is usually required.<ref name=BTS/> In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging - especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the [[anatomy|anatomical location]] of the pneumothorax.<ref name=Leigh-Smith/><ref name=Rosen2010/>

===Chest X-ray===
[[File:Pneumothorax CXR.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A chest X-ray showing a pneumothorax on the right (left side of the patient), with the other contents of the chest shifted away from the air due to pressure|Chest X-ray of left-sided pneumothorax (seen on the right in this image). The left thoracic cavity is partly filled with air occupying the [[pleural space]]. The mediastinum is shifted to the opposite side.]]

Traditionally a plain [[radiograph]] of the chest, ideally with the [[X-ray]] beams being projected from the back (posteroanterior, or "PA"), has been the most appropriate first investigation. These are usually performed during maximal inspiration (holding one's breath); no added information is gathered by obtaining a chest X-ray in expiration (after exhaling).<ref name=Noppen/><ref name=BTS/> If the PA X-ray does not show a pneumothorax but there is a strong suspicion of one, lateral X-rays (with beams projecting from the side) may be performed, but this is not routine practice.<ref name=BTS/><ref name=Robinson/> It is not unusual for the [[mediastinum]] (the structure between the lungs that contains the heart, great blood vessels and large airways) to be shifted away from the affected lung due to the pressure differences. This is ''not'' equivalent to a tension pneumothorax, which is determined mainly by the constellation of symptoms, hypoxia, and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref name=Noppen/>

The size of the pneumothorax (i.e. the volume of air in the pleural space) can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring the distance between the chest wall and the lung. This is relevant to treatment, as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently. An air rim of 2&nbsp;cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50% of the hemithorax.<ref name=BTS/> British professional guidelines have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed at the level of the [[Hilum of lung|hilum]] (where blood vessels and airways enter the lung) with 2&nbsp;cm as the cutoff,<ref name=BTS/> while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the [[Apex of lung|apex]] (top) of the lung with 3&nbsp;cm differentiating between a "small" and a "large" pneumothorax.<ref name=Baumann>{{cite journal |author=Baumann MH, Strange C, Heffner JE, ''et al'' |title=Management of spontaneous pneumothorax: an [[American College of Chest Physicians]] Delphi consensus statement |journal=Chest |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=590–602 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11171742 |doi=10.1378/chest.119.2.590 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/119/2/590.long}}</ref> The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex, which is a common occurrence.<ref name=BTS/> The various methods correlate poorly, but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size.<ref name=BTS/><ref name=Robinson/> CT scanning (see below) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax, but its routine use in this setting is not recommended.<ref name=Baumann/>

Not all pneumothoraces are uniform; some only form a pocket of air in a particular place in the chest.<ref name=BTS/> Small amounts of fluid  may be noted on the chest X-ray ([[hydropneumothorax]]); this may be blood ([[hemopneumothorax]]).<ref name=Noppen/> In some cases, the only significant abnormality may be the "[[deep sulcus sign]]", in which the normally small space between the chest wall and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] appears enlarged due to the abnormal presence of fluid.<ref name=Leigh-Smith/>

===Computed tomography===
[[X-ray computed tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT, or "CAT scan") can be useful in particular situations. In some lung diseases, especially emphysema, it is possible for abnormal lung areas such as bullae (large air-filled sacs) to have the same appearance as a pneumothorax on chest X-ray, and it may not be safe to apply any treatment before the distinction is made and before the exact location and size of the pneumothorax is determined.<ref name=BTS/> In trauma, where it may not be possible to perform an upright film, chest radiography may miss up to a third of pneumothoraces, while CT remains very [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]].<ref name=Rosen2010/>

A further use of CT is in the identification of underlying lung lesions. In presumed primary pneumothorax, it may help to identify blebs or [[cyst|cystic lesions]] (in anticipation of treatment, see below), and in secondary pneumothorax it can help to identify most of the causes listed above.<ref name=BTS/><ref name=Robinson/>

===Ultrasound===
[[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] is commonly used in the evaluation of people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the [[Focused assessment with sonography for trauma|FAST protocol]].<ref name="Scalea">{{cite journal | author=Scalea T, Rodriguez A, Chiu W, ''et al'' | title=Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST): results from an international consensus conference | journal=Journal of Trauma | volume=46 | issue=3 | pages=466–72 | year=1999 | pmid=10088853 | doi=10.1097/00005373-199903000-00022}}</ref> Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after [[blunt trauma]] to the chest.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Wilkerson RG, Stone MB | title=Sensitivity of bedside ultrasound and supine anteroposterior chest radiographs for the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma | journal=Academic Emergency Medicine | year=2010 | month=January | pages=11–17 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pmid=20078434 | doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00628.x}}</ref> Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification of the size of the pneumothorax.

==Management==
The treatment of pneumothorax depends on a number of factors, and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a [[chest tube]]. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] illness, the presence of underlying lung disease, the estimated size of the pneumothorax on X-ray, and - in some instances - on the personal preference of the person involved.<ref name=BTS/>

In traumatic pneumothorax, chest tubes are usually inserted. If mechanical ventilation is required, the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory.<ref name=Noppen/><ref name=Keel>{{cite journal |author=Keel M, Meier C |title=Chest injuries - what is new? |journal=Current Opinion in Critical Care |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=674–9 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17975389 |doi=10.1097/MCC.0b013e3282f1fe71}}</ref> Any open chest wound should be covered with an airtight seal, as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax. Ideally, a [[Dressing (medical)|dressing]] called the "Asherman seal" should be utilized, as it appears to be more effective than a standard "three-sided" dressing. The Asherman seal is a specially designed device that adheres to the chest wall and, through a valve-like mechanism, allows air to escape but not to enter the chest.<ref name=Lee>{{cite journal |author=Lee C, Revell M, Porter K, Steyn R |title=The prehospital management of chest injuries: a consensus statement.

Tension pneumothorax is usually treated with urgent needle decompression. This may be required before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an [[emergency medical technician]] or other trained professional.<ref name=Leigh-Smith/><ref name=Lee/> The needle or [[cannula]] is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted.<ref name=Leigh-Smith/><ref name=Lee/> If tension pneumothorax leads to [[cardiac arrest]], needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore [[cardiac output]].<ref name=ILCOR>{{cite journal |author=Neumar RW, Otto CW, Link MS, ''et al'' |title=Part 8: adult advanced cardiovascular life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S729–67 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20956224 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/122/18_suppl_3/S729.full}}</ref>

===Conservative===
Small spontaneous pneumothoraces do not always require treatment, as they are unlikely to proceed to [[respiratory failure]] or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no [[shortness of breath|breathlessness]], and there is no underlying lung disease.<ref name=Robinson/><ref name=Baumann/> It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited.<ref name=BTS/> Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an [[outpatient]], at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below).<ref name=BTS/> Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6&nbsp;weeks.<ref name=BTS/>

Secondary pneumothoraces are only treated conservatively if the size is very small (1&nbsp;cm or less air rim) and there are limited symptoms. Admission to the hospital is usually recommended.

In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP associated with breathlessness, some professional guidelines recommend that reducing the size by [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspiration]] is equally effective as the insertion of a chest tube. This involves the administration of [[local anesthetic]] and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5&nbsp;liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction in the size of the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases.<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=BTS/><ref name=Robinson/> Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission significantly, without increasing the risk of complications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wakai A, O'Sullivan RG, McCabe G |title=Simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004479 |year=2007 |pmid=17253510 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004479.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004479/frame.html |editor1-last=Wakai |editor1-first=Abel}}</ref>

Aspiration may also be considered in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2&nbsp;cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure.<ref name=BTS/> American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces - even those due to PSP - should be treated with a chest tube.<ref name=Baumann/> Moderately sized [[iatrogenic]] traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.<ref name=Noppen/>

===Chest tube===
A [[chest tube]] (or intercostal drain) is the most definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax. These are typically inserted in an area under the [[axilla]] (armpit) called the "[[chest tube#Technique|safe triangle]]", where damage to internal organs can be avoided; this is delineated by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple and two muscles of the chest wall ([[latissimus dorsi muscle|latissimus dorsi]] and [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]]). Local anesthetic is applied. Two types of tubes may be used. In spontaneous pneumothorax, small-bore (smaller than 14&nbsp;[[French catheter scale|F]], 4.7&nbsp;mm diameter) tubes may be inserted by the [[Seldinger technique]], and larger tubes do not have an advantage.<ref name=BTS/> In traumatic pneumothorax, larger tubes (28&nbsp;F, 9.3&nbsp;mm) are used.<ref name=Lee/>

Chest tubes are required in PSPs that have not responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs  (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a [[check valve|one-way valve]] system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a [[Trap (plumbing)|water seal]], or a [[Flutter valve|Heimlich valve]]. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of [[pulmonary edema]] ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it for a period of time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.<ref name=BTS/><ref name=Robinson/><ref name=Baumann/>

If after 2–4&nbsp;days there is still evidence of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20&nbsp;[[Centimetre of water|cmH<sub>2</sub>O]]) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; it is thought that this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.<ref name=BTS/>

Chest tubes are used first-line when pneumothorax occurs in people with [[AIDS]], usually due to underlying [[pneumocystis pneumonia]] (PCP), as this condition is associated with prolonged air leakage. Bilateral pneumothorax (pneumothorax on both sides) is relatively common in people with pneumocystis pneumonia, and surgery is often required.<ref name=BTS/>

===Pleurodesis and surgery===
[[Pleurodesis]] is a procedure that permanently obliterates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. The best results are achieved with a [[thoracotomy]] (surgical opening of the chest)&mdash;with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs&mdash;followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%.<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=BTS/>

A less invasive approach is [[thoracoscopy]], usually in the form of a procedure called [[video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery]] (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy, but produce smaller scars in the skin.<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=BTS/> Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery.<ref name=BTS/> VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of [[talc]], which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=BTS/>

If a chest tube is already in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve chemical [[pleurodesis]], specifically talc or the antibiotic [[tetracycline]]. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches,<ref name=Tschopp/><ref name=BTS/> but talc pleurodesis has been found to have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.<ref name=Tschopp/>

===Aftercare===
If pneumothorax occurs in a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of [[smoking cessation]].<ref name=BTS/> It may be advisable for someone to remain off work for up to a week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.<ref name=Brown>{{cite book |author=Brown I, Palmer KT, Robin C |title=Fitness for work: the medical aspects |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |pages=481–2 |isbn=0-19-921565-0}}</ref>

[[Air travel]] is discouraged for up to seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur.<ref name=BTS/> [[Underwater diving]] is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that [[spirometry|lung function tests]] and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed.<ref name=BTS/><ref name=Baumann/> Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.<ref name=BTS/>

==Prevention==
A preventative procedure ([[thoracotomy]] or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended after an episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. [[Evidence-based medicine|Evidence]] on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US.<ref name=Tschopp/> Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation of the risk of recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax.<ref name=Bau04>{{cite journal |author=Baumann MH, Noppen M |title=Pneumothorax |journal=Respirology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=157–64 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15182264 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2004.00577.x}}</ref> Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.<ref name=BTS/>

==Epidemiology==
The annual age-adjusted [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence rate]] (AAIR) of PSP is thought to be three to six times as high in males as in females. Fishman<ref name="Fishman1519">{{Cite book | author=Levine DJ, Sako EY, Peters J | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=1519 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref><ref name="Light306">{{Cite book | author=Light RW | title=Pleural diseases | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year=2007 | page=306 | edition=5th | isbn=0-7817-6957-4 }}</ref> cites AAIR's of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in males and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP - in people who are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP.<ref name="Fishman1519"/>

The risk of contracting a first spontaneous pneumothorax is elevated among male and female smokers by factors of approximately 22 and 9, respectively, compared to matched non-smokers of the same sex.<ref name="pmid3677805">{{cite journal| doi=10.1378/chest.92.6.1009| author=Bense L, Eklund G, Wiman LG| title=Smoking and the increased risk of contracting spontaneous pneumothorax | journal=Chest | year= 1987 | volume= 92 | issue= 6 | pages= 1009–12 | pmid=3677805 }}</ref> Individuals who smoke at higher intensity are at higher risk, with a "greater-than-linear" effect: men who smoke 10 cigarettes per day have an approximate 20-fold increased risk over comparable non-smokers, while smokers consuming 20 cigarettes per day show an estimated 100-fold increase in risk.<ref name="Fishman1519"/>

In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the estimated annual AAIR is 6.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years for males and females,<ref name="Fishman1520"/><ref name="Light315">{{Cite book | author=Light RW | title=Pleural diseases | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year=2007 | page=315 | edition=5th | isbn=0-7817-6957-4 }}</ref> respectively, with the risk of recurrence depending on the presence and severity of any underlying lung disease. Once a second episode has occurred, there is a high likelihood of subsequent further episodes.<ref name=Tschopp/> The incidence in children has not been well studied,<ref name=Robinson/> but is estimated to be between 5 and 10 cases per 100,000 person-years.<ref name=Sahn2000>{{cite journal| author=Sahn SA, Heffner JE| title=Spontaneous pneumothorax | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | year= 2000 | volume= 342 | issue= 12 | pages= 868–74 | pmid=10727592 | doi=10.1056/NEJM200003233421207}}</ref>

Death from pneumothorax is very uncommon (except in tension pneumothoraces). British statistics show an annual mortality rate of 1.26 and 0.62 deaths per million person-years in men and women, respectively.<ref name=BTS/> A significantly increased risk of death is seen in older victims and in those with secondary pneumothoraces.<ref name=Tschopp/>

==History==
An early description of traumatic pneumothorax secondary to rib fractures appears in ''Imperial Surgery'' by Turkish surgeon [[Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu]] (1385–1468), which also recommends a method of simple aspiration.<ref name=Anatolia>{{cite journal |author=Kaya SO, Karatepe M, Tok T, Onem G, Dursunoglu N, Goksin, I |title=Were pneumothorax and its management known in 15th-century anatolia? |journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=152–153 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19436812 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19436812 |pmc=2676596}}</ref>

Pneumothorax was described in 1803 by [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]], a student of [[René Laennec]], who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819.<ref>{{cite book | author=Laennec RTH | title=Traité de l'auscultation médiate et des maladies des poumons et du coeur - part II | language=French | location=Paris | year=1819}}</ref> While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to [[tuberculosis]] (then the most common cause), the concept of primary spontaneous pneumothorax was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932.<ref name=BTS/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Kjærgard H | title=Spontaneous pneumothorax in the apparently healthy | journal=Acta Medica Scandinavica | year=1932 | volume=43 Suppl | pages=1–159 | doi=10.1111/j.0954-6820.1932.tb05982.x}}</ref> In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax.<ref name=BTS/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Tyson MD, Crandall WB | title=The surgical treatment of recurrent idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax | journal=Journal of Thoracic Surgery | year=1941 | volume=10 | pages=566–70}}</ref>

Prior to the advent of [[Tuberculosis treatment|anti-tuberculous medications]], iatrogenic pneumothoraces were intentionally given to people with tuberculosis in an effort to collapse a [[Lung#Anatomy|lobe]], or entire [[lung]], around a cavitating [[lesion]]. This was known as "resting the lung". It was introduced by the Italian surgeon  [[Carlo Forlanini]] in 1888, and publicized by the American surgeon [[John Benjamin Murphy]] in the early 20th century (after discovering the same procedure independently). Murphy used the (then) recently discovered X-ray technology to create pneumothoraces of the correct size.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herzog H |title=History of tuberculosis |journal=Respiration |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=5–15 |year=1998 |pmid=9523361 |doi=10.1159/000029220 |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=000029220&Ausgabe=226544&ProduktNr=224278&filename=000029220.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref>

==In other animals==
Animals may experience both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax is divided into open and closed (with or without chest wall damage).<ref name=Pawloski>{{cite journal |author=Pawloski DR, Broaddus KD |title=Pneumothorax: a review |journal=J Am Anim Hosp Assoc |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=385–97 |year=2010 |pmid=21041331}}</ref> The diagnosis may be apparent to the [[veterinary physician]] because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing.
