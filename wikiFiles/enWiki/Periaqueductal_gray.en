'''Periaqueductal gray''' (PAG; also called the "central gray") is the [[gray matter]] located around the [[cerebral aqueduct]] within the [[tegmentum]] of the [[midbrain]]. It plays a role in the descending modulation of [[pain]] and in defensive behaviour. The ascending pain and temperature fibers of the [[spinothalamic tract]] also send information to the PAG via the spinomesencephalic tract (so-named because the fibers originate in the [[vertebral column|spine]] and terminate in the PAG, in the [[mesencephalon]] or midbrain).

==Role in analgesia==

Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain activates [[enkephalin]]-releasing neurons that project to the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. 5-HT ([[serotonin]]) released from the [[raphe nuclei]] descends to the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] of the spinal cord where it forms excitatory connections with the "inhibitory interneurons" located in Laminae II (aka the [[substantia gelatinosa of Rolando|substantia gelatinosa]]). When activated, these interneurons release either enkephalin or dynorphin (endogenous opioid neurotransmitters), which bind to [[mu opioid receptor]]s on the axons of incoming C and A-delta fibers carrying pain signals from [[nociceptor]]s activated in the periphery. The activation of the mu-opioid receptor inhibits the release of substance P from these incoming first-order neurons and, in turn, inhibits the activation of the second-order neuron that is responsible for transmitting the pain signal up the spinothalamic tract to the ventroposteriolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. The nociceptive signal was inhibited before it was able to reach the cortical areas that interpret the signal as "pain" (such as the anterior cingulate). This is sometimes referred to as the [[Pain#Gate_control|Gate control theory of pain]] and is supported by the fact that electrical stimulation of the PAG results in immediate and profound [[analgesia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Basbaum AI, Fields HL |title=Endogenous pain control mechanisms: review and hypothesis |journal=Ann. Neurol. |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=451–62 |year=1978 |month=November |pmid=216303 |doi=10.1002/ana.410040511 |url=}}</ref>

Three known kinds of [[opioid receptor]]s have been identified: [[μ-opioid receptor|mu (μ)]], [[κ-opioid receptor|kappa (κ)]] and [[δ-opioid receptor|delta (δ)]]. Synthetic opioid and opioid-derivative drugs activate these receptors (possibly by acting on the PAG directly, where these receptors are densely expressed) to produce analgesia. These drugs include [[heroin]], [[morphine]], [[pethidine]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], and similar pain-reducing compounds.

==Role in defensive behavior==
Stimulation of the dorsal and lateral aspects of the PAG (in the rat) can provoke defensive responses characterised by freezing immobility, running, jumping, tachycardia, and increases in blood pressure and [[muscle tonus]]. In contrast, stimulation of the caudal ventrolateral PAG can result in an immobile, relaxed posture known as [[wikt:quiescence|quiescence]], whereas its inhibition leads to increased locomotor activity.

Lesions of the caudal ventrolateral PAG can greatly reduce [[Classical conditioning|conditioned]] freezing, whereas lesions of the dorsal aspect can reduce innate defensive behavior, virtually "[[taming]]" the animal.

==Role in reproductive behavior==
[[Neuron]]s of the PAG are excited by [[endorphins]] and by [[opiate]] [[analgesic]]s.  It also plays a role in [[female]] copulatory behavior (see [[Lordosis behavior]]) via a pathway from the ventromedial nucleus of the [[hypothalamus]].

==Role in maternal behavior==
The PAG may be specifically involved in human [[Maternal bond|maternal behavior]]. The PAG contains a high density of [[vasopressin]] and [[oxytocin]] receptors, and it has direct connections with the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], which might mediate the role of the PAG in maternal love. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex is activated by pleasant visual, tactile, and olfactory stimuli. Its response depends on pleasantness rather than on intensity of stimulation. Here, its activity is likely to reflect one aspect of the pleasant emotions associated with motherly love.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/Bartels2004_maternalLove_%5B0%5D.pdf | title=The neural correlates of maternal and romantic love | author=Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki | journal=NeuroImage | year=2004 | month=March | volume=21 | issue=3 | pages=1155–1166 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.11.003 | pmid=15006682}}</ref>

==Role in consciousness==
If there is a [[lesion]] in the PAG, then [[consciousness]] is lost. This observation does not mean that the PAG, itself, is the center of consciousness, but rather that it is a critically needed part of it.<ref name="TSN Consciousness">[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/origins-symposium/panel-1-consciousness-complex-cognition-and-language Patricia Churchland (Video)] (2009), Consciousness panel of The Science Network (min. 26)</ref><ref name="kdkdk">[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/ce/2000/00000001/00000001/art00005 Watt D.FT] (2000), "The centrecephalon and thalamocortical integration: Neglected contributions of periaqueductal gray".</ref>
