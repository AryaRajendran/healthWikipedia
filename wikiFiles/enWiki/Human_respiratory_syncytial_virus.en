'''Human respiratory syncytial virus''' (RSV) is a [[virus]] that causes [[respiratory tract]] infections. It is a major cause of [[lower respiratory tract infection]]s and hospital visits during infancy and childhood. A [[prophylactic]] medication (not a [[vaccine]]) exists for [[preterm]] (under 35 weeks gestation) infants, infants with certain [[congenital heart defects]] (CHD) or [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] (BPD), and infants with [[congenital]] malformations of the [[airway]]. [[#Treatment|Treatment]] is limited to supportive care, including [[oxygen therapy]]. 

In [[Temperateness|temperate climates]] there is an annual [[epidemic]] during the winter months.  In [[tropical climate]]s, infection is most common during the rainy season.

In the United States, 60% of infants are infected during their first RSV season,<ref name=Glezen86>{{cite journal |pmid=3706232 |year=1986 |last1=Glezen |first1=WP |last2=Taber |first2=LH |last3=Frank |first3=AL |last4=Kasel |first4=JA |title=Risk of primary infection and reinfection with respiratory syncytial virus. |volume=140 |issue=6 |pages=543–6 |journal=American journal of diseases of children (1960)}}</ref> and nearly all children will have been infected with the virus by 2–3 years of age.<ref name=Glezen86/> Of those infected with RSV, 2–3% will develop [[bronchiolitis]], necessitating hospitalization.<ref name=Hall09>{{cite journal |pages=588–98 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa0804877 |title=The Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Young Children |year=2009 |last1=Hall |first1=Caroline Breese |last2=Weinberg |first2=Geoffrey A. |last3=Iwane |first3=Marika K. |last4=Blumkin |first4=Aaron K. |last5=Edwards |first5=Kathryn M. |last6=Staat |first6=Mary A. |last7=Auinger |first7=Peggy |last8=Griffin |first8=Marie R. |last9=Poehling |first9=Katherine A. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=6 |pmid=19196675}}</ref> Natural infection with RSV induces protective immunity which wanes over time—possibly more so than other respiratory viral infections—and thus people can be infected multiple times. Sometimes an infant can become symptomatically infected more than once, even within a single RSV season. Severe RSV infections have increasingly been found among elderly patients. Young adults can be re-infected every five to seven years, with symptoms looking like a sinus infection or a cold (infections can also be asymptomatic). 

RSV is a [[Sense_(molecular_biology)#Negative-sense|negative-sense]], single-stranded [[RNA virus]] of the family ''[[Paramyxoviridae]]'', which includes common respiratory viruses such as those causing [[measles]] and [[mumps]].  RSV is a member of the paramyxovirus subfamily Pneumovirinae.  Its name comes from the fact that [[F proteins]] on the surface of the virus cause the cell membranes on nearby cells to merge, forming [[syncytia]].

==Signs and symptoms==
For most people, RSV produces only mild symptoms, often indistinguishable from [[common cold]]s and minor illnesses.   The Centers for Disease Control consider RSV to be the "most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and [[pneumonia]] in children under 1 year of age in the United States."<ref>

For some children, RSV can cause [[bronchiolitis]], leading to severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization and, rarely, causing death. This is more likely to occur in patients that are immunocompromised or infants [[Premature birth|born prematurely]]. Other RSV symptoms common among infants include listlessness, poor or diminished appetite, and a possible fever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://baby.lovetoknow.com/wiki/RSV_in_Infants |title=RSV in Infants&nbsp;— LoveToKnow Baby |publisher=baby.lovetoknow.com |accessdate=2010-01-26 }}</ref>

Recurrent wheezing and [[asthma]] are more common among individuals who suffered severe RSV infection during the first few months of life than among controls;<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1123–9 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200804-579OC |title=Evidence of a Causal Role of Winter Virus Infection during Infancy in Early Childhood Asthma |year=2008 |last1=Wu |first1=P. |last2=Dupont |first2=W.

V. |journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine |volume=178 |issue=11 |pmid=18776151 |pmc=2588491}}</ref> whether RSV infection sets up a process that leads to recurrent wheezing or whether those already predisposed to asthma are more likely to become severely ill with RSV has yet to be determined.

Symptoms of pneumonia in immuno-compromised patients such as in transplant patients and especially bone marrow transplant patients should be evaluated to rule out RSV infection. This can be done by means of PCR testing for RSV nucleic acids in peripheral blood samples if all other infectious processes have been ruled out or if it is highly suspicious for RSV such as a recent exposure to a known source of RSV infection.

In at least one case, RSV onset appears to have coincided with the onset of [[type 2 diabetes]], and there may be a possible correlation.<ref>

===Genome===

The genome is ~15,000 [[nucleotide]]s in length and is composed of a single strand of [[RNA]] with negative polarity. It has 10 genes encoding 11 proteins — there are 2 [[open reading frame]]s of M2. The genome is transcribed sequentially from NS1 to L with reduction in expression levels along its length.

'''NS1''' and '''NS2''' inhibit type I [[interferon]] activity. 

'''N'''  encodes nucleocapsid protein that associates with the genomic RNA forming the nucleocapsid. 

'''M''' encodes the Matrix protein required for viral assembly. 

'''SH''', '''G''' and '''F''' form the viral coat. The G protein is a surface [[protein]] that is heavily glycosylated.  It functions as the attachment protein. The F protein is another important surface protein; F mediates fusion, allowing entry of the virus into the cell [[cytoplasm]] and also allowing the formation of syncytia. The F protein is homologous in both subtypes of RSV; antibodies directed at the F protein are neutralizing. In contrast, the G protein differs considerably between the two subtypes. 

'''M2''' is the second matrix protein also required for [[transcription]] and encodes M2-1 (elongation factor) and M2-2 (transcription regulation). M2 contains [[CD8]] [[epitope]]s. 

'''L''' encodes the [[RNA polymerase]]. 

The phosphoprotein '''P''' is a cofactor for the L protein. 

The atomic structure is now available for two of these proteins: '''N'''<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19965480 |year=2009 |last1=Tawar |first1=RG |last2=Duquerroy |first2=S |last3=Vonrhein |first3=C |last4=Varela |first4=PF |last5=Damier-Piolle |first5=L |last6=Castagné |first6=N |last7=MacLellan |first7=K |last8=Bedouelle |first8=H |last9=Bricogne |first9=G |title=Crystal structure of a nucleocapsid-like nucleoprotein-RNA complex of respiratory syncytial virus |volume=326 |issue=5957 |pages=1279–83 |doi=10.1126/science.1177634 |journal=Science}}</ref> and '''M'''.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19251668 |year=2009 |last1=Money |first1=VA |last2=McPhee |first2=HK |last3=Mosely |first3=JA |last4=Sanderson |first4=JM |last5=Yeo |first5=RP |title=Surface features of a Mononegavirales matrix protein indicate sites of membrane interaction |volume=106 |issue=11 |pages=4441–6 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0805740106 |pmc=2657372 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}}</ref> 

===Evolution===

Bayesian estimates of the mutation rates in the subtype A genomes give a mutation rate of 6.47×10<sup>-4</sup> (credible interval: 5.56×10<sup>-4</sup> — 7.38×10<sup>-4</sup>) substitutions/site/year.<ref name=Tan2012>{{cite journal |author=Tan L, Lemey P, Houspie L, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic Variability among Complete Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Subgroup A Genomes: Bridging Molecular Evolutionary Dynamics and Epidemiology |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e51439 |year=2012 |pmid=23236501 |pmc=3517519 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051439 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051439}}</ref> This is similar to other RNA viruses. The population size has remained constant over the last 70 years and the G protein appears to be the main site of diversifying selection. The most recent common ancestor evolved ~1943 (credible interval: 1923–1954).

===Transmission===
RSV spreads easily by [[direct contact]], and can remain viable for a half an hour or more on hands or for up to 5 hours on countertops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) |date=January 2011 |work=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia, PubMed Health |publisher= National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002531/}}</ref>

==Prevention==
As the virus is ubiquitous in all parts of the world, avoidance of infection is not possible.  Epidemiologically, a vaccine would be the best answer. A vaccine trial in 1960s using a formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV), increased disease severity in children who had been vaccinated.<ref name=Kim>{{cite journal |pmid=4305198 |year=1969 |last1=Kim |first1=HW |last2=Canchola |first2=JG |last3=Brandt |first3=CD |last4=Pyles |first4=G |last5=Chanock |first5=RM |last6=Jensen |first6=K |last7=Parrott |first7=RH |title=Respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants despite prior administration of antigenic inactivated vaccine |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=422–34 |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology}}</ref> There is much active investigation into the development of a new vaccine, but at present no vaccine exists. Some of the most promising candidates are based on temperature sensitive mutants which have targeted genetic mutations to reduce virulence.

However, [[palivizumab]] (brand name [[Synagis]] manufactured by [[MedImmune]]), a moderately effective [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] drug is available for infants at high risk.  Palivizumab is a [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against RSV surface fusion [[protein]]. It is given by monthly injections, which are begun just prior to the RSV season and are usually continued for five months.  RSV prophylaxis is indicated for infants that are premature or have either cardiac or lung disease, but the cost of prevention limits use in many parts of the world. An antiviral drug—[[Ribavirin]]—is licensed for use, but its efficacy is limited.<ref name=Ventre>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000181.pub3 |title=Ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus infection of the lower respiratory tract in infants and young children |year=2007 |last1=Ventre |first1=Kathleen |last2=Randolph |first2=Adrienne |editor1-last=Ventre |editor1-first=Kathleen}}</ref>

==Laboratory diagnosis==
RSV infection can be confirmed using [[Direct fluorescent antibody|Direct Fluorescent Antibody detection (DFA)]], Chromatographic rapid antigen detection or detection of viral RNA using RT PCR [Reverse-transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction). Quantification of viral load can be determined by [[Plaque_assay#Plaque_assay|Plaque Assay]], antigen capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA), [[Enzyme_immunoassay|ELISA]] and [[Hemagglutination_assay|HA]], and quantification of antibody levels by [[Viral_Hemagglutination_Assay#Viral_Hemagglutination_Assay|HAI]] and [[Plaque_reduction_neutralization_test|Neutralisation assay]].

==Treatment==
Studies of [[nebulized]] [[Saline_(medicine)#Other|hypertonic saline]] have shown that the "use of nebulized 3% HS is a safe, inexpensive, and effective treatment for infants hospitalized with moderately severe viral bronchiolitis" where "respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for the majority of viral bronchiolitis cases".<ref name="kuzik">{{cite journal |pmid=17719935 |year=2007 |last1=Kuzik |first1=BA |last2=Al-Qadhi |first2=SA |last3=Kent |first3=S |last4=Flavin |first4=MP |last5=Hopman |first5=W |last6=Hotte |first6=S |last7=Gander |first7=S |title=Nebulized hypertonic saline in the treatment of viral bronchiolitis in infants |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=266–70, 270.e1 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2007.04.010 |journal=The Journal of pediatrics}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=481–7 |doi=10.1378/chest.123.2.481 |title=Nebulized 3% Hypertonic Saline Solution Treatment in Hospitalized Infants With Viral Bronchiolitis |year=2003 |last1=Mandelberg |first1=A. |journal=Chest |volume=123 |issue=2 |pmid=12576370 |last2=Tal |first2=G |last3=Witzling |first3=M |last4=Someck |first4=E |last5=Houri |first5=S |last6=Balin |first6=A |last7=Priel |first7=IE}}</ref> 
One study noted a 26% reduction in length of stay: 2.6 ± 1.9 days, compared with 3.5 ± 2.9 days in the normal-saline treated group (p=0.05).<ref name="kuzik"/>

Supportive care includes fluids and oxygen until the illness runs its course. [[Salbutamol]] may be used in an attempt to relieve any [[bronchospasm]] if present. Increased airflow, humidified and delivered via [[nasal cannula]], may be supplied in order to reduce the effort required for respiration.  Adrenaline, bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, and ribavirin confer "no real benefit".<ref>Bourke TW, Shields MD. Bronchiolitis.
