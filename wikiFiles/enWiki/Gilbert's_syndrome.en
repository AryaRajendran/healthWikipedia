'''Gilbert's syndrome''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|iː|l|ˈ|b|ɛər}} {{respell|zheel|BAIR|'}}), often shortened to '''GS''', also called Gilbert–Meulengracht syndrome, is the most common [[hereditary]] cause of increased [[bilirubin]] and is found in up to 5% of the population (though some [[gastroenterology|gastroenterologists]] {{cn|date=July 2012}} maintain that it is closer to 10%). A major characteristic is [[jaundice]], supposedly caused by elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream ([[hyperbilirubinemia]]).

The cause of this hyperbilirubinemia is the reduced activity of the [[enzyme]] [[glucuronyltransferase]], which [[Conjugated system|conjugates]] bilirubin and a few other lipophilic molecules.  Conjugation renders the bilirubin water-soluble, after which it is excreted in [[bile]] into the [[duodenum]].

==Signs and symptoms==
===Jaundice===
Gilbert's syndrome produces an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin in the [[blood]]stream but normally has no serious consequences. Mild [[jaundice]] may appear under conditions of exertion, stress, fasting, and infections, but the condition is otherwise usually asymptomatic.<ref>Kasper et al., ''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine'', 16th edition, McGraw-Hill 2005</ref><ref>Boon et al., ''Davidson's Principles & Practice of Medicine'', 20th edition, Churchill Livingstone 2006</ref>

It has been reported that GS may contribute to an accelerated onset of neonatal jaundice, especially in the presence of increased [[hemolysis]] due to diseases like [[G6PD deficiency]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bancroft JD, Kreamer B, Gourley GR |title=Gilbert syndrome accelerates development of neonatal jaundice |journal=Journal of Pediatrics | volume=132 |issue=4 |pages=656–60 |year=1998 |pmid=9580766 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(98)70356-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cappellini MD, Di Montemuros FM, Sampietro M, Tavazzi D, Fiorelli G |title=The interaction between Gilbert's syndrome and G6PD deficiency influences bilirubin levels |journal=British journal of haematology | volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=928–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10192462 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1999.1331a.x}}</ref> This situation can be especially dangerous if not quickly treated as the high bilirubin causes irreversible neurological disability in the form of [[kernicterus]].

===Detoxification of certain drugs===
The enzymes that are defective in GS ([[UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1|UGT1A1]]) are also responsible for some of the [[liver]]'s ability to [[detoxification|detoxify]] certain drugs. For example, Gilbert's syndrome is associated with severe diarrhea and [[neutropenia]] in patients who are treated with [[irinotecan]], which is metabolized by UGT1A1.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Marcuello E, Altés A, Menoyo A, Del Rio E, Gómez-Pardo M, Baiget M | title=UGT1A1 gene variations and irinotecan treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer | journal=Br J Cancer | volume=91 | issue=4 | pages=678–82 | year=2004 | pmid=15280927 | doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602042 | pmc=2364770}}</ref>

===Signs and Symptoms===
Symptoms, whether connected or not to GS, have been reported in a subset of those affected: feeling tired all the time (fatigue), difficulty maintaining concentration, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, loss of weight, itching (with no rash), and others,<ref name=GSC>[http://www.gilbertssyndrome.com/ GilbertsSyndrome.com]</ref> but scientific studies found no clear pattern of adverse symptoms related to the elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in adults<ref name=dispute>{{cite journal | author=Olsson R, Bliding A, Jagenburg R, Lapidus L, Larsson B, Svärdsudd K, Wittboldt S. | title=Gilbert's syndrome—does it exist?

==Cause==
Gilbert's syndrome is a [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effect, characterized by mild [[jaundice]] due to increased unconjugated [[bilirubin]], that arises from several different [[genotype|genotypic]] variants of the gene for the [[enzyme]] responsible for changing [[bilirubin]] to the conjugated form. 

Gilbert's syndrome is characterized by a 70–80% reduction, rather than more severe loss of activity, in the [[glucuronidation]] activity of the enzyme, [[glucuronosyltransferase|uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1]] (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, or UGT1A1). The [[UGT1A1]] gene is located on human chromosome 2.<ref name=nlm54658>{{cite web|title=Entrez Gene: UGT1A1 UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=54658|accessdate=}}</ref> 

There are considerably in excess of 100 variants of the UGT1A1 gene, designated as UGT1A1*n (where n is the general chronological order of discovery), either of the gene itself or of its [[promoter region]]. The UGT1A1 gene is associated with a [[TATA box]] promoter region ; this region most commonly contains the genetic sequence A(TA<sub>6</sub>)TAA; this variant accounts for about 50% of [[allele]]s in many populations.  There are however several allelic [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic variants]] of this region, the most common adding another [[Tandem repeat|dinucleotide repeat]] TA to the promoter region, so that it is thus referred to as A(TA<sub>7</sub>)TAA, being also called UGT1A1*28; this common variant accounts for about 40% of alleles in some populations, but is seen less often, approximately 3% of alleles, in southeast and east Asian people and Pacific Islanders.

In most populations, Gilbert's syndrome is most commonly associated with [[homozygous]] A(TA<sub>7</sub>)TAA alleles.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Raijmakers MT, Jansen PL, Steegers EA, Peters WH|title=Association of human liver bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity, most commonly due to a polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene|journal=Journal of Hepatology|year=2000|volume=33|issue=3|pages=348–351|pmid=11019988|doi=10.1016/S0168-8278(00)80268-8}}</ref><ref name="Bosma UDP-1">{{cite journal | author=Bosma PJ, Chowdhury JR, Bakker C, Gantla S, de Boer A, Oostra BA, Lindhout D, Tytgat GN, Jansen PL, Oude Elferink RP, et al. | title=The genetic basis of the reduced expression of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 in Gilbert's syndrome |journal=New England Journal of Medicine| volume=333 | issue=18 | pages=1171–5 | year=1995 | pmid=7565971 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199511023331802}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Monaghan G, Ryan M, Seddon R, Hume R, Burchell B | title=Genetic variation in bilirubin UPD-glucuronosyltransferase gene promoter and Gilbert's syndrome | journal=Lancet | volume=347 | issue=9001 | pages=578–81 | year=1996 | pmid=8596320 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)91273-8}}</ref>   In 94% of GS cases, two other glucuronosyltransferase enzymes, [[UGT1A6]] (rendered 50% inactive) and [[UGT1A7]] (rendered 83% ineffective), are also affected.  

However, Gilbert's syndrome can arise without TATA box promoter polymorphic mutations;  in some populations, particularly healthy southeast and east Asians, Gilbert's syndrome is more often a consequence of [[heterozygote]] [[missense mutations]] (such as Gly71Arg also known as UGT1A1*6, Tyr486Asp also known as UGT1A1*7, Pro364Leu also known as UGT1A1*73) in the actual gene coding region,<ref name="Mukherjee">{{EMedicine|article|176822|Gilbert Syndrome}}</ref> which may be associated with significantly higher bilirubin levels.<ref name="Mukherjee" /> 

Because of its effects on drug and bilirubin breakdown and because of its genetic inheritance, Gilbert's syndrome can be classed as a minor inborn error of metabolism.

==Diagnosis==
People with GS predominantly have elevated unconjugated bilirubin, while conjugated bilirubin is usually within the normal range and is less than 20% of the total. Levels of bilirubin in GS patients are reported to be from 20 μM to 90 μM (1.2 to 5.3&nbsp;mg/dL)<ref name="Bosma UDP-1" /> compared to the normal amount of < 20 μM. GS patients will have a ratio of unconjugated/conjugated (indirect/direct) bilirubin that is commensurately higher than those without GS.

The level of total bilirubin is often further increased if the blood sample is taken after [[fasting]] for two days,<ref>{{cite journal |author=J L Gollan, C Bateman, B H Billing |title=Effect of dietary composition on the unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia of Gilbert's syndrome |journal=Gut |issue=  5|pages=335–340 |year=1976 |doi=10.1136/gut.17.5.335 |volume=17 |pmid=1278716 |pmc=1411132}}</ref> and a fast can therefore be useful diagnostically. A further conceptual step that is rarely necessary or appropriate is to give a low dose of [[phenobarbital]]:<ref>{{cite journal |author=N Carulli, M Ponz de Leon, E Mauro, F Manenti, A Ferrari |title=Alteration of drug metabolism in Gilbert's syndrome |journal=Gut |issue=  8|pages=581–587 |year=1976 |doi=10.1136/gut.17.8.581 |volume=17 |pmid=976795 |pmc=1411334}}</ref> the bilirubin will decrease substantially.

There are also tests that detect DNA mutations of UGT1A1 by [[polymerase chain reaction]] or DNA fragment sequencing.

===Differential diagnosis===
While this syndrome is considered harmless, it is clinically important because it may give rise to a concern about a blood or liver condition, which could be more dangerous.  However, these conditions have additional indicators: 

*[[Hemolysis]] can be excluded by a full blood count, haptoglobin, [[lactate dehydrogenase]] levels and the absence of reticulocytosis (elevated reticulocytes in the blood would usually be observed in haemolytic anaemia).
*[[Viral hepatitis]] can be excluded by negative blood samples for antigens specific to the different hepatitis viruses.
*[[Cholestasis]] can be excluded by the absence of [[lactate dehydrogenase]], low levels of conjugated bilirubin and [[ultrasound]] scan of the bile ducts.
*More severe types of glucuronyl transferase disorders like [[Crigler–Najjar syndrome]] (types I and II). These are much more severe, with 0–10% UGT1A1 activity, with sufferers at risk of brain damage in infancy (type I) and teenage years (type II).
*[[Dubin–Johnson syndrome]] and [[Rotor syndrome]], which are rarer [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] disorders that are characterized by an increase of conjugated bilirubin.
*In GS, unless another disease of the liver is also present, the liver enzymes [[Alanine transaminase|ALAT]] and [[ASAT]], as well as [[albumin]], are within normal ranges.

== History ==
Gilbert's syndrome was first described by French gastroenterologist [[Augustin Nicolas Gilbert]] and co-workers in 1901.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2877|Gilbert's syndrome}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilbert A, Lereboullet P |title=La cholemie simple familiale |journal=Sem Med |volume=21 |pages=241–3 |year=1901 }}</ref> In German literature, it is commonly associated with [[Jens Einar Meulengracht]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|2449|Jens Einar Meulengracht}}</ref>

Alternative, less common names for this disorder include:
* Familial benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
* Constitutional liver dysfunction
* Familial non-hemolytic non-obstructive jaundice
* Icterus intermittens juvenilis
* Low-grade chronic hyperbilirubinemia
* Unconjugated benign bilirubinemia
