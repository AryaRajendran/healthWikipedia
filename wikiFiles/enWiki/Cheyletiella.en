==Cheyletiellosis==
'''Cheyletiellosis''' (also known as ''Cheyletiella'' dermatitis),"<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et. al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref> is a mild [[dermatitis]] caused by [[mite]]s of the [[genus]] ''Cheyletiella''.  It is also known as '''walking dandruff''' due to skin scales being carried by the mites.  

Cheyletiellosis is seen more commonly in areas where [[flea]]s are less prevalent, because of the decreased use of flea products that are also efficacious for the treatment of this mite.

Cheyletiellosis is highly contagious.  Transmission is by direct contact with an affected animal.  

===Presentation===
Symptoms in animals vary from no signs to intense itching, scales on the skin, and hair loss.  The lesions are usually on the [[dorsum (biology)|back]] of the animal.  Symptoms in humans include multiple red, itchy bumps on the arms, trunk, and buttocks.  Because humans are an irregular host for the mite, the symptoms usually go away in about three weeks.

===Diagnosis===
Diagnosis is by finding the mites or eggs microscopically in a skin scraping, combing, or on [[Cellulose acetate|acetate]] tape applied to the skin.  

===Treatment===
The most common treatment in animals is weekly use of some form of topical [[pesticide]] appropriate for the affected animal, often an anti[[flea]] product.  [[Fipronil]] works well, especially in cats.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scarampella F, Pollmeier M, Visser M, Boeckh A, Jeannin P |title=Efficacy of fipronil in the treatment of feline cheyletiellosis |journal=Vet Parasitol |volume=129 |issue=3-4 |pages=333–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15845289 |doi=10.1016/j.vetpar.2005.02.008}}</ref>
