'''Burkitt's lymphoma''' (or "Burkitt's tumor", Burkitt lymphoma or "malignant lymphoma, Burkitt's type") is a [[cancer]] of the [[lymphatic system]] (in particular, [[B lymphocytes]]).  It is named after [[Denis Parsons Burkitt]], a [[surgeon]] who first described the disease in 1956 while working in [[equatorial Africa]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2511}}</ref><ref name="pmid13628987">{{cite journal |author=Burkitt D |title=A sarcoma involving the jaws in African children |journal=The British journal of surgery |volume=46 |issue=197 |pages=218–23 |year=1958 |pmid=13628987|doi=10.1002/bjs.18004619704}}</ref>

==Classification==
Currently Burkitt's lymphoma can be divided into three main clinical variants: the endemic, the sporadic and the immunodeficiency-associated variants.  
* The '''endemic variant''' occurs in [[equatorial Africa]]. It is the most common malignancy of children in this area.  Children affected with the disease often also had chronic [[malaria]], which is believed to have reduced resistance to [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV), allowing it to take hold. The disease characteristically involves the jaw or other facial bone, distal ileum, cecum, ovaries, kidney or the breast.

* The '''sporadic type''' of Burkitt lymphoma (also known as "non-African") is another form of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] found outside of Africa.  The tumor cells have a similar appearance to the cancer cells of classical African or endemic Burkitt lymphoma. Again it is believed that impaired immunity provides an opening for development of the [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes Burkitt's, accounts for 30-50% of childhood lymphoma.  The jaw is less commonly involved, compared to the endemic variant. The [[Ileocecal valve|ileo-cecal]] region is the common site of involvement.

* '''Immunodeficiency-associated''' Burkitt lymphoma is usually associated with [[HIV]] infection<ref name="pmid12610094">{{cite journal |author=Bellan C, Lazzi S, De Falco G, Nyongo A, Giordano A, Leoncini L |title=Burkitt's lymphoma: new insights into molecular pathogenesis |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=188–92 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12610094 |pmc=1769902 |doi= 10.1136/jcp.56.3.188|url=http://jcp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12610094}}</ref> or occurs in the setting of post-transplant patients who are taking immunosuppressive drugs. Burkitt lymphoma can be one of the diseases associated with the initial manifestation of [[AIDS]].

By [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] (i.e. microscopic appearance) or [[immunophenotype]], it is almost impossible to differentiate these three clinical variants. Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma may demonstrate more plasmacytic appearance or more pleomorphism, but these features are not specific.

==Epidemiology==
Of all [[lymphoproliferative disorders|cancers involving the same class of blood cell]], 2.3% of cases are Burkitt's lymphoma.<ref name="isbn0-7817-5007-5">{{cite book

==Malignant B cell characteristics==
Normal B cells possess rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes and each isolated B-cell possesses a unique IgH gene rearrangement. Since Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas are a clonal proliferative process, all tumor cells from one patient are supposed to possess identical IgH genes. When the DNA of tumor cells is analyzed using [[electrophoresis]], a clonal band can be demonstrated, since identical IgH genes will move to the same position.  On the contrary, when a normal or reactive lymph node is analyzed using the same technique, a smear rather than a distinct band will be seen. This technique is useful since sometimes benign reactive processes (e.g. infectious mononucleosis) and malignant lymphoma can be difficult to distinguish.

==Microscopy==
The tumor consists of sheets of a monotonous (i.e. similar in size and morphology) population of medium size lymphoid cells with high proliferative activity and [[apoptotic]] activity.  The "starry sky" appearance seen<ref name="pmid15086279">{{cite journal |author=Fujita S, Buziba N, Kumatori A, Senba M, Yamaguchi A, Toriyama K |title=Early stage of Epstein-Barr virus lytic infection leading to the "starry sky" pattern formation in endemic Burkitt lymphoma |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=128 |issue=5 |pages=549–52 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15086279 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165(2004)128<549:ESOEVL>2.0.CO;2|url=http://journals.allenpress.com/jrnlserv/?request=get-abstract&issn=0003-9985&volume=128&page=549}}</ref> under low power is due to scattered tingible body-laden macrophages (macrophages containing dead body of apoptotic tumor cells).  The old descriptive term of "small non-cleaved cell" is misleading.  The tumor cells are mostly medium in size (i.e. tumor nuclei size similar to that of [[histiocytes]] or [[endothelial cells]]). "Small non-cleaved cells" are compared to "large non-cleaved cells" of normal germinal center lymphocytes. Tumor cells possess small amount of basophilic cytoplasm. The cellular outline usually appears squared off.

==Immunohistochemistry==
The tumor cells in Burkitt lymphoma generally strongly express markers of B cell differentiation (CD20, CD22, CD19) as well as CD10, and BCL6.  The tumour cells are generally negative for BCL2 and TdT.  The high mitotic activity of Burkitt lymphoma is confirmed by nearly 100% of the cells staining positive for Ki67.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=978-92-832-2431-0}}</ref>

==Genetics==
All types of Burkitt's lymphoma are characterized by disregulation of the [[c-myc]] gene by one of three chromosomal translocations.<ref name=Hoffman>{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Ronald|title=Hematology : basic principles and practice|year=2009|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-443-06715-0|pages=1304–1305|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/das/book/pdf/331595517-4/978-0-443-06715-0/4-u1.0-B978-0-443-06715-0..50083-2..DOCPDF.pdf?isbn=978-0-443-06715-0&eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-443-06715-0..50083-2..DOCPDF|edition=5th ed.}}</ref> This gene is found at [[chromosome 8|8q24]].

* The most common variant is t(8;14)(q24;q32), which accounts for approximately 85%<ref name=Hoffman /> of cases. This involves [[c-myc]] and [[IGH@]]. A variant of this, a three-way translocation, t(8;14;18), has also been identified.<ref name="pmid17547754">{{cite journal |author=Liu D, Shimonov J, Primanneni S, Lai Y, Ahmed T, Seiter K |title=t(8;14;18): a 3-way chromosome translocation in two patients with Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia |journal=Mol.

* A rare variant is at t(2;8)(p12;q24).<ref name="pmid18813817">{{cite journal |author=Smardova J, Grochova D, Fabian P, ''et al.'' |title=An unusual p53 mutation detected in Burkitt's lymphoma: 30 bp duplication |journal=Oncol.

* Another rare variant is t(8;22)(q24;q11).<ref name="pmid18813817"/> This involves [[IGL@]] and c-myc.

Combined, the two less-common translocations, t(2;8)(p12;q24) and t(8;22)(q24;q11), account for the remaining 15% of cases not due to the t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation.<ref name=Hoffman />

==Gene targets==
Unique genetic alterations promote cell survival in Burkitt lymphoma, distinct from other types of lymphoma.<ref>{{cite web|title=NIH study shows Burkitt lymphoma is molecularly distinct from other lymphomas|url=http://cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2012/BurkittReleaseStaudt|publisher=National Cancer Institute}}</ref> 
These [[TCF3]] and [[ID3 (gene)|ID3]] gene mutations in Burkitt correspond to a cell survival pathway that may be found to be amenable to [[targeted therapy]].<ref>Staudt L, et al.

The effects of the [[chemotherapy]], as with all cancers, depend on the time of diagnosis. With faster growing cancers, such as Burkitt's, the cancer actually responds faster than with slower growing cancers. This rapid response to chemotherapy can be hazardous to the patient, as a phenomenon called "[[tumor lysis syndrome]]" could occur.  Close monitoring of the patient and adequate hydration is essential during the process.

[[Chemotherapy]] 
* [[cyclophosphamide]]
* [[doxorubicin]]
* [[vincristine]]
* [[methotrexate]]
* [[cytarabine]]
* [[ifosfamide]]
* [[etoposide]]
* [[rituximab]]<ref name="pmid17534164">{{cite journal |author=Yustein JT, Dang CV |title=Biology and treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma |journal=Curr. Opin. Hematol. |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=375–81 |year=2007 |pmid=17534164 |doi=10.1097/MOH.0b013e3281bccdee}}</ref>

Other treatments are [[immunotherapy]], [[bone marrow transplant]]s, [[stem cell transplant]], [[surgery]] to remove the tumor, and [[radiotherapy]].

==Prognosis==
Treatment with dose-adjusted EPOCH with Rituxan ([[rituximab]]) has shown an 8 year survival rate of 91% for low risk, 90% for low-intermediate risk, 67% for high-intermediate risk, and 31% for high risk cases with few of the side effects associated with Burkitt's lymphoma chemotherapy.<ref name="PMID2409217"/>
