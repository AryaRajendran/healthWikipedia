'''Oral and maxillofacial surgery''' is [[surgery]] to treat many diseases, injuries and defects in the head, neck, face, jaws and the hard and soft tissues of the oral (mouth) and maxillofacial (jaws and face) region. It is an internationally [[Legal recognition|recognized]] surgical specialty. In some countries, including the United States, it is a recognized [[Specialty (dentistry)|specialty of dentistry]]; in others, including the UK, it is recognized as a [[medical specialty]].

==Regulations==
In several countries oral and maxillofacial surgery is a speciality recognized by a professional association, as is the case with the [[American Dental Association]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], [[Royal College of Dentists of Canada]], [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]] and the Brazilian Federal Council of Odontology (CFO).  

In other countries oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty exists but under different forms as the work is sometimes performed by a single or dual qualified specialist depending on each country's regulations and training opportunities available.

==Summary==
An oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a  regional specialist [[surgery|surgeon]] treating the entire [[Craniofacial|craniomaxillofacial complex]]: [[Anatomy|anatomical]] area of the [[mouth]], [[jaw]]s, [[face]], [[Human skull|skull]], as well as associated structures.

Depending upon the jurisdiction, maxillofacial surgeons may require training in [[dentistry]], [[surgery]], and general [[medicine]]; training and qualification in medicine may be undertaken optionally even if not required. An optional medical qualification can qualify the holder for hospital and operating room access not open to others.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery is universally recognized as one of the specialties of dentistry. In the UK and many other countries OMS is a medical specialty requiring both medical and dental degrees, culminating in an appropriate qualification (e.g. [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]], FRCS, in the UK).  All oral and maxillofacial surgeons must obtain a university degree in dentistry before beginning residency training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. 

They also may choose to undergo further training in a 1 or 2 year subspecialty [[Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Fellowship Training]] in the following areas:
* [[Head and neck cancer]] – [[Microsurgery|microvascular reconstruction]]
* [[Cosmetic_surgery#Cosmetic_surgery|Cosmetic facial surgery]]
* [[Craniofacial surgery]]/Pediatric Maxillofacial surgery/Cleft Surgery
* Cranio-maxillofacial trauma
* Head and neck reconstruction (plastic surgery of the head and neck region)
* Maxillofacial regeneration (reformation of the facial region by advanced stem cell technique)

The popularity of oral and maxillofacial surgery as a career for persons whose first degree was medicine, not dentistry, seems to be increasing in few EU countries{{Clarify|date=June 2012|reason="few" or "a few"? Almost opposite meanings}}. However, the public fund spend for 14 years of training is a big concern of the state. Integrated programs are becoming more available to medical graduates allowing them to complete the dental degree requirement in about 3 years in order for them to advance to subsequently complete Oral and Maxillofacial surgical training.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tambcd.edu/oralsurgery/residency/residency.html |title=Baylor College of Dentistry: OMS Residency Admission Requirements |accessdate=2 July 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080508100254/http://www.tambcd.edu/oralsurgery/residency/residency.html| archivedate = May 8, 2008}}</ref>

===Surgical procedures===
Treatments may be performed on the [[Craniofacial|craniomaxillofacial complex]]: mouth, jaws, neck, face, skull, and include:
* [[Dentoalveolar]] surgery (surgery to remove impacted [[teeth]], difficult [[tooth]] extractions, extractions on medically compromised patients, bone grafting or preprosthetic surgery to provide better anatomy for the placement of [[dental implant|implants]], [[dentures]], or other dental prostheses)
* Diagnosis and treatment of [[benign]] [[pathology]] ([[cyst]]s, [[tumor]]s etc.)
* Diagnosis and treatment (ablative and [[reconstructive surgery]], [[microsurgery]]) of [[malignant]] pathology (oral & [[head and neck cancer]]).
* Diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous malignancy ([[skin cancer]]), [[lip reconstruction]]
* Diagnosis and treatment of [[congenital]] [[craniofacial]] malformations such as [[cleft lip]] and [[palate]] and cranial vault malformations such as [[craniosynostosis]], ([[craniofacial surgery]])
* Diagnosis and treatment of chronic facial pain disorders
* Diagnosis and treatment of [[temporomandibular]] joint (TMJ) disorders
* Diagnosis and treatment of dysgnathia (incorrect bite), and orthognathic (literally "straight bite") [[reconstructive surgery]], [[orthognathic surgery]], [[maxillomandibular advancement]], surgical correction of facial asymmetry.
* Diagnosis and treatment of soft and hard tissue trauma of the oral and maxillofacial region (jaw fractures, cheek bone fractures, [[Nasal cavity|nasal]] fractures, [[LeFort fracture]], [[Human skull|skull]] fractures and [[eye socket]] fractures).
* Splint and surgical treatment of [[sleep apnea]], [[maxillomandibular advancement]], [[genioplasty]] (in conjunction with sleep labs or [[physician]]s)
* Surgery to insert osseointegrated (bone fused) [[dental implant]]s and Maxillofacial implants for attaching [[craniofacial prosthesis|craniofacial prostheses]] and [[Bone Anchored Hearing Aid|bone anchored hearing aid]]s.
* [[Cosmetic_surgery#Cosmetic_surgery|Cosmetic surgery]] of the head and neck: ([[rhytidectomy]]/facelift, [[browlift]], [[blepharoplasty]]/[[Asian blepharoplasty]], [[otoplasty]], [[rhinoplasty]], [[septoplasty]], [[cheek augmentation]], [[chin augmentation]], [[genioplasty]], [[oculoplastics]], [[liposuction|neck liposuction]], [[lip enhancement]], injectable cosmetic treatments, botox, [[chemical peel]] etc.)

==In Australia, New Zealand, and North America==
Oral and maxillofacial surgery is one of the nine dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons.  Oral and maxillofacial surgery requires 4–6 years of further formal university training after dental school (DDS, BDent, DMD or BDS). Four-year residency programs grant a certificate of specialty training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Six-year residency programs grant the specialty certificate in addition to a medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]], MBBS, MBChB etc.). Both 4 and 6 year graduates are designated  US "Board Eligible," those that earn "Certification" are Diplomats'.  Approximately 50% of the training programs in the US, 100% of the programs in Australia and New Zealand, and 20% of Canadian training programs, are "dual-degree". The trainees obtain a degree in medicine (MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB etc.) as well as a specialty certificate in oral and maxillofacial surgery, although the scope of surgery remains unchanged.

The typical training program for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is:
*2 – 4 years undergraduate study (BS, BA, or equivalent degrees)
*4 years dental study ([[Dentistry|DMD, BDent, DDS or BDS]])
*4 – 6 years [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training (6 years includes 2 additional years for acquiring [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]])
*After completion of surgical training most undertake final specialty examinations: (US "Board Certified (ABOMS)"), (Australia/NZ: "FRACDS(OMS)"), or (Canada: "FRCD(C)(OMS)")
* Many dually qualified oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now also obtaining fellowships with the American College of Surgeons ([[American College of Surgeons|FACS]])
*Average total length after secondary school: 12 – 14 years

In addition, graduates of oral and maxillofacial surgery training programs can pursue fellowships, typically 1 – 2 years in length, in the following areas:
*[[Head and neck cancer]] – [[Microsurgery|microvascular reconstruction]]
*[[Cosmetic_surgery#Cosmetic_surgery|Cosmetic facial surgery]] (facelift, rhinoplasty, etc.)
*[[Craniofacial surgery]] and pediatric maxillofacial surgery (cleft lip and palate repair, surgery for craniosynostosis, etc.)
*[[facial trauma|Cranio-maxillofacial trauma]] (soft tissue and skeletal injuries to the face, head and neck)
