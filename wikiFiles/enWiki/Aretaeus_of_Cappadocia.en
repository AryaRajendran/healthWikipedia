'''Aretaeus''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀρεταῖος}}), is one of the most celebrated of the ancient Greek [[physician]]s, of whose life, however, few particulars are known. There is some uncertainty regarding both his age and country, but it seems probable that he practised in the 1st&nbsp;century&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], during the reign of [[Nero]] or [[Vespasian]]. He is generally styled "the Cappadocian" ({{lang|grc|Καππάδοξ}}).

==Diagnostic method==
'''Aretaeus''' wrote in [[Ionic Greek]] a general treatise on [[disease]]s, which is still extant, and is certainly one of the most valuable relics of antiquity. The book displays great accuracy in the detail of symptoms, and in seizing the diagnostic character of diseases. In his practice he followed for the most part the method of [[Hippocrates]], but he paid less attention to what have been styled "the natural actions" of the system; and, contrary to the practice of the ''[[Hippocrates|Father of Medicine]]'', he did not hesitate to attempt to counteract them, when they appeared to him to be injurious. One disease he described was later known as [[Celiac Disease]] and is common in the world today.

The account which he gives of his treatment of various diseases indicates a simple and sagacious system, and one of more energy than that of the professed Methodici. Thus he freely administered active [[purgative]]s; he did not object to [[narcotics]]; he was much less averse to [[bloodletting|bleeding]]; and upon the whole his ''Materia Medica'' was both ample and efficient.

It may be asserted generally that there are few of the ancient physicians, since the time of Hippocrates, who appear to have been less biased by attachment to any peculiar set of opinions, and whose account of the phenomena and treatment of disease has better stood the test of subsequent experience. Aretaeus is placed by some writers among the [[Pneumatic school|Pneumatici]] because he maintained the doctrines which are peculiar to this sect; other systematic writers, however, think that he is better entitled to be placed with the [[Eclectic school|Eclectics]].

==Works==
Aretaeus' work consists of eight books, two ''De causis et signis acutorum morborum'', two ''De causis et signis diuturnorum morborum'', two ''De curatione acutorum morborum'', and two ''De curatione diuturnorum morborum''. They are in a tolerably complete state of preservation, though a few chapters are lost.

The work was first published in a [[Latin language|Latin]] translation by [[Junius Paulus Crassus]] (Giunio Paolo Grassi), Venice 1552, together with [[Rufus Ephesius]]. The first Greek edition is that by [[Jacobus Goupylus]], Paris, 1554, which is more complete than the Latin version of Crassus. In 1723 a major edition in folio was published at the Clarendon press at Oxford, edited by [[John Wigan (physician)|John Wigan]], containing an improved text, a new Latin version, learned dissertations and notes, and a copious index by [[Michel Maittaire]]. In 1731, [[Herman Boerhaave|Boerhaave]] brought out a new edition, of which the text and Latin version had been printed before the appearance of Wigan's; this edition contains annotations by [[Pierre Petit (scholar)|Pierre Petit]] and Daniel Wilhelm Triller. The edition by C. G. Kühn, Leipzig 1828, included Wigan's text, Latin version, dissertations, etc., together with Petit's commentary, Triller's emendations, and Maittaire's index. An edition by [[F. Z. Ermerins]] was published in Utrecht in 1847.

A more recent standard edition is by Karl Hude (1860–1936) in the ''Corpus medicorum graecorum'' (2nd ed., Berlin, Akademie-Verlag, 1958, [http://cmg.bbaw.de/epubl/online/cmg_02.html online]). The four books ''De causis et signis'' have now been issued in an annotated bilingual edition in Greek and French (Arétée de Cappadoce, ''Des causes et des signes des maladies aiguës et chroniques'', trans. R.T.H. Laennec, ed. and comm. Mirko D. Grmek, pref. by Danielle Gourevitch, Geneva, 2000).

==Bibliography==
The medical opinions of Aretaeus have been discussed by such scholars as [[Johann Albert Fabricius]], [[Albrecht von Haller]], and [[Kurt Sprengel]]. Aretaeus has been treated more recently in a couple of short monographs:
* [[Karl Deichgräber]], ''Aretaeus von Kappadozien als medizinischer Schriftsteller'', Berlin, 1971.
* Fridolf Kudlien, ''Untersuchungen zu Aretaios von Kappadokien'', Mainz, 1964.
For Aretaeus' influence on [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giambattista Morgagni]], the father of anatomical pathology, see:
* Giorgio Weber, ''Areteo di Cappadocia: interpretazioni e aspetti della formazione anatomo-patologica del Morgagni'', Florence, 1996
