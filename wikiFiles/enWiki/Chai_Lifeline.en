'''Chai Lifeline''' is a [[New York City]] volunteer-based<ref>[http://www.thelakewoodscoop.com/news/2011/11/chai-lifeline-nj-kicks-off-volunteer-recruitment.html The Lakewood Scoop: Chai Lifeline NJ Kicks Off Volunteer Recruitment]</ref> [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]]<ref>[http://www.taxexemptworld.com/organizations/new_york_ny_10001.asp New York NY 10001- Tax Exempt Organizations and 10001 New York New York Non Profit Organizations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with multiple regional offices in the United States as well as affiliates in Canada, England, Israel, and Belgium. Founded in 1987 and currently headed by Rabbi Simcha Scholar, Chai Lifeline was primarily a cancer support organization that mushroomed into an umbrella organization which carries the motto ''Fighting Illness With Love''.
Chai Lifeline ensures that ill children are minimally affected by their illness, thus bringing happiness to their tough childhood, also creating programs for their families so that the child doesn't feel the impact. They also ease the financial burden of devastating illnesses by offering all types of free services to stricken families. A widely acclaimed project is its pilot program Camp Simcha, a summer camp for children battling cancer and other hematological illnesses.<ref>http://pioneersforacure.org/camp-simcha.aspx</ref> Camp Simcha has since expanded and opened a second branch, Camp Simcha Special, for children with debilitating chronic conditions. Another program they initiated is the Project C.H.A.I. Crisis Intervention program. This program ensures that children, their parents, teachers, clergy and communities can properly deal with traumatic events, often partnering with organizations such as Jewish Family & Children's Service of Arizona's Aleinu program and [[Misaskim]].<ref>[http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?111202+crisis Jewish News of Greater Phoenix: JFCS forms crisis response team]</ref><ref>[http://www.thejewishstar.com/stories/Quick-action-averted-cremation,18?content_source=&category_id=&search_filter=misaskim&event_mode=&event_ts_from=&list_type=&order_by=&order_sort=&content_class=&sub_type=&town_id= The Jewish Star: Quick action averted cremation]</ref><ref>[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=35242 The Yeshiva World PHOTOS: Misaskim Hosts Important Meeting Between NYPD Brass & Many Bais Yaakov Administrators]</ref> Chai Lifeline is funded by Jewish philanthropists and other fundraising receptions.<ref>[http://carrollgardens.patch.com/articles/keep-the-money-flowing-in Carol Gardens Patch: Keep the Money Flowing In!]</ref><ref>[http://lincolnshire.suntimes.com/lifestyles/trend/9309248-423/chai-lifelines-caliente-a-hot-night-for-a-cool-cause.html Lincolnshire Review: Chai Lifeline’s “Caliente: A Hot Night for a Cool Cause”]</ref><ref>[http://www.insidetoronto.com/news/local/article/1055494--ex-nhl-players-hit-ice-for-sick-children InsideToronto.com: Ex-NHL players hit ice for sick children]</ref><ref>[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=37298 The Yeshiva World: Chai Lifeline Lakewood 10th Anniversary Reception]</ref><ref>[http://www.socialmiami.com/articles/Make-A-Difference-Gala.asp Social Miami: Make-A-Difference Gala Benefits Chai Lifeline Southeast]</ref> They also receive government funding and grants.<ref>[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=36084 The Yeshiva World City Council Delivers Over $5 Million Of ‘Kosher Pork’ « » Frum Jewish News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Camp Simcha==

Camp Simcha is a {{convert|125|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus located in [[Glen Spey, NY]] that offers children with cancer ages 5–20 an unforgettable experience to forget about their illnesses for a while. Campers enjoy traditional camp activities, including mini-golf, pottery, crafts workshops, modified sports, color war, and talent shows. Special events include: helicopter rides, concerts, and interactive games and shows. There's also an on-site arcade, computer-games center, library, and screening room. A magnificent pool with innovative ramp and water-submersible wheelchairs enables that every child can go swimming. A waterfront boasts the Chai Seas motorboat, a pontoon boat capable of holding an entire bunk, including wheelchair-dependent children, paddle and bumper boats.<ref>[http://sdjewishjournal.com/site/2929/special-camps-for-special-kids/ San Diego Jewish Journal: Special Camps for Special Kids]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vYzdp2zu34 YouTube - WFSB Eyewitness News 3: Camp Aims To Give Cancer Patients Hope: New York Camp Offers Free Fun For Kids With Cancer]</ref>
