}}'''Olaus Rudbeck''' (also known as ''Olof Rudbeck the Elder'', to distinguish him from his son, and occasionally with the surname Latinized as ''Olaus Rudbeckius'') (September 13, 1630 &ndash; December 12, 1702) was a Swedish scientist and writer, professor of medicine at [[Uppsala University]] and for several periods ''[[rector magnificus]]'' of the same university. He was born in [[Västerås]], the son of Bishop [[Johannes Rudbeckius]], who was personal chaplain to King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], and the father of botanist [[Olof Rudbeck the Younger]].  Rudbeck is primarily known for his contributions in two fields: human anatomy and linguistics, but he was also accomplished in many other fields including music and botany. (He established the first botanical garden in Sweden at Uppsala, called Rudbeck's Garden, but which was renamed a hundred years later for his son's student, the botanist [[Carolus Linnaeus]].)

==Human anatomy==
Rudbeck was one of the pioneers in the study of lymphatic vessels. According to his supporters in Sweden, he was the first to discover the [[lymphatic system]] and is documented as having shown his findings at the court of Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] in the Spring of 1652. However, he did not publish anything about it until the fall of 1653, after [[Thomas Bartholin]], a Danish scientist, had published a description of a similar discovery of his own.<ref>Eriksson, G. (2004). ''Svensk medicinhistorisk tidskrift'', 2004;8(1):39-44. In Swedish. English abstract at [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16025602&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum Olaus Rudbeck as scientist and professor of medicine], U.S. National Library of Medicine. Retrieved 1 June 2007.</ref> (For other early discoverers of the lymphatic system, see [[Gasparo Aselli]] and [[Jean Pecquet]]).

Rudbeck's research led to the Queen's support of his career. To facilitate his studies of human anatomy, he had a [[cupola]] built on top of [[Gustavianum]], a university edifice, and in it was built an arena-like ''[[Theatrum anatomicum]]'', where dissection could be carried out in front of students. The cupola still remains and is a landmark in [[Uppsala]]. The "Gustavianum" stands in front of the cathedral, and is still part of the university.

==Historical linguistics==
[[Image:Rudbeck Atlantis.jpg|thumb|180px|An illustration from 1689 in Olof Rudbeck's book ''Atlantica'' where he shows himself surrounded by [[Hesiod]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Tacitus]], [[Odysseus]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Orpheus]].]]

Between 1679-1702, Rudbeck dedicated himself to contributions in historical-linguistics patriotism, writing a 3,000-page treatise in four volumes called ''Atlantica'' (''[[Atland eller Manheim]]'' in Swedish) where he purported to prove that Sweden was [[Atlantis]], the cradle of civilization, and Swedish the [[Adamic language|original language of Adam]] from which [[Latin]] and [[Hebrew]] had evolved.<ref>Auroux, Sylvain, ed. (2006). ''History of the Language Sciences: An International Handbook on the Evolution of Language Sciences''. Walter de Gruyter, ISBN 3-11-016735-2, pp. 1125-1126.</ref> His work was criticized by several Scandinavian authors, including the Danish professor [[Ludvig Holberg]], and the Swedish author and physician [[Andreas Kempe]], both of whom wrote satires based on Rudbeck's writings. His work was later used by [[Denis Diderot]] in the article "Etymologie" in ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' as a cautionary example of deceptive linking of [[etymology]] with mythical history.<ref>Bandle, Oskar et al. (2002). ''The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages''. Volume I. Walter de Gruyter, ISBN 3-11-014876-5, p. 109.</ref>

[[David King (historian)|David King]], in his biography of Rudbeck, notes that he developed a system for measuring the age of old monuments and graves by the thickness of the [[humus]] accumulated over them - which, though many of his conclusions were erroneous, anticipated the methods of modern archaeology and was far in advance of most historians and antiquarians of his time.<ref>David King, "Finding Atlantis" ( Epilogue)</ref>

Despite the criticism targeting his linguistic theories and despite the [[priority dispute]] with Bartholin, Rudbeck remained a national icon in Sweden for many years. His son, [[Olof Rudbeck the Younger]], continued his linguistic work and also became involved in providing an "intellectual reason" for power during a period when Sweden aspired to a position as one of the [[great power]]s of Europe. Rudbeck the Younger added speculations about the relationship between [[Sami languages|Sami]] and Hebrew languages to his father's long list of fantastical linguistic relationships. A nephew of Olaus the Elder, Petter Rudebeck, also wrote antiquarian books going even further, purporting to locate the scene of the [[Trojan War]] and ancient city of [[Troy]] in southern Sweden.

The above-mentioned David King noted that, while specific conclusions of father and son Rudbeck about the relationships of various languages to each other were disproven, they anticipated the later systematic study of [[Indo-European Languages]], and the scientific proof that languages distant from each other geographically and historically are indeed related.

==Legacy==
Rudbeck was active in many scientific areas, including [[astronomy]], and left many traces still visible in the city of Uppsala today.

During the course of a fire that destroyed most of Uppsala in 1702, a large portion of Rudbeck's writings was lost. Rudbeck himself directed the people of the city, shouting orders from a roof while his house burned down. He died the same year, shortly after the fire, and was buried in Uppsala Cathedral at the transept.  (Since then, Swedish monarchs have frequently been crowned over his grave.)

The [[Nobel family]], including [[Ludvig Nobel]], the founder of [[Branobel]], and [[Alfred Nobel]], the founder of the [[Nobel Prize]]s, was a descendant of Rudbeck through his daughter Wendela, who married one of her father's former students, Peter Olai Nobelius.

The plant genus ''[[Rudbeckia]]'' was named by the botanist [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in honor of both Rudbeck and his son.
