In medicine, '''infusion therapy''' deals with all aspects of fluid and medication infusion, usually via the [[intravenous]] route. A special infusion pump can be used for this purpose.<ref>

==Treatments==
Infusion therapy involves the administration of medication through a needle or catheter. It is prescribed when a patient’s condition cannot be treated effectively by oral medications. Typically, “infusion therapy” means that a drug is administered intravenously, but the term also may refer to situations where drugs are provided through other [[Route of administration|non-oral routes]], such as [[intramuscular injection]]s and [[epidural]] routes (into the membranes surrounding the spinal cord).

Until the 1980s, patients receiving infusion therapy had to remain in an [[Inpatient care|inpatient setting]] for the duration of their therapy. Heightened emphasis on cost-containment in health care, as well as developments in the clinical administration of the therapy, led to strategies to administer infusion therapy in alternate settings. For individuals requiring long-term therapy, inpatient care is not only expensive but also prevents the individual from resuming normal lifestyle and work activities.
