'''Niacin''' (also known as '''vitamin B<sub>3</sub>''', '''nicotinic acid''' and '''vitamin PP''') is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|C|6|H|5|NO|2}} and, depending on the definition used, one of the 40 to 80 [[essential nutrient|essential human nutrients]].

Niacin is one of five vitamins (when lacking in human diet) associated with a [[pandemic]] [[Nutrition disorder|deficiency disease]]: niacin deficiency ([[pellagra]]), [[vitamin C]] deficiency ([[scurvy]]), [[thiamin]] deficiency ([[beriberi]]), [[vitamin D]] deficiency ([[rickets]] and [[osteomalacia]]), [[vitamin A deficiency]] ([[night blindness]] and other symptoms). Niacin has been used for over 50 years to increase levels of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] in the blood and has been found to modestly decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in a number of controlled human trials.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bruckert|first=E|coauthors=Labreuche, J; Amarenco, P|title=Meta-analysis of the effect of nicotinic acid alone or in combination on cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis|journal=Atherosclerosis|date=2010 Jun|volume=210|issue=2|pages=353–61|pmid=20079494|doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.12.023}}</ref>

This colorless, water-soluble solid is a derivative of [[pyridine]], with a [[carboxyl group]] (COOH) at the 3-position.  Other forms of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> include the corresponding [[amide]], [[nicotinamide]] ("niacinamide"), where the carboxyl group has been replaced by a carboxamide group ({{chem|CONH|2}}), as well as more complex amides and a variety of esters. Nicotinic acid and niacinamide are convertible to each other with steady world demand rising from 8500 tonnes per year in 1980s to 40,000 in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22112948 | year = 2011 | last1 = Cantarella | first1 = L | last2 = Gallifuoco | first2 = A | last3 = Malandra | first3 = A | last4 = Martínková | first4 = L | last5 = Spera | first5 = A | last6 = Cantarella | first6 = M | title = High-yield continuous production of nicotinic acid via nitrile hydratase-amidase cascade reactions using cascade CSMRs | volume = 48 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 345–50 | doi = 10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.12.010 | journal = Enzyme and microbial technology}}</ref>

Niacin cannot be directly converted to nicotinamide, but both compounds could be converted to [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]] and [[NADP]] ''[[in vivo]]''. Nicotinic acid, nicotinamid and tryptophan (via quinoline acid) are co-factors for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation using NAD-kinase enzyme. They are coenzyme of various (more than 100) [[hydrogenase]]s being important in hydrogen transfer almost in every oxidation reduction reaction in the body.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal | pmid = 21128910 | year = 2011 | last1 = Wan | first1 = P | last2 = Moat | first2 = S | last3 = Anstey | first3 = A | title = Pellagra: A review with emphasis on photosensitivity | volume = 164 | issue = 6 | pages = 1188–200 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.10163.x | journal = The British journal of dermatology}}</ref> NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein and alcohol as well as cell signaling and DNA repair and NADP mostly in anabolism reaction such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7229643 | year = 1981 | last1 = Ishii | first1 = N | last2 = Nishihara | first2 = Y | title = Pellagra among chronic alcoholics: Clinical and pathological study of 20 necropsy cases | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–15 | pmc = 490893 | journal = Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.44.3.209}}</ref> Although the two are identical in their vitamin activity, nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological effects (lipid modifying effects) as niacin.

[[File:Pellagra NIH.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A man with pellagra, which is caused by a chronic lack of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> in the diet]]
At present, niacin deficiency is sometimes seen in developed countries, and it is usually apparent in conditions of poverty, malnutrition, and chronic alcoholism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pitsavas S, Andreou C, Bascialla F, Bozikas VP, Karavatos A |title=Pellagra encephalopathy following B-complex vitamin treatment without niacin |journal=Int J Psychiatry Med |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=91–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15242145 |url=http://baywood.metapress.com/link.asp?id=29xv1gg1u17krgjh |doi=10.2190/29XV-1GG1-U17K-RGJH }}</ref>  It also tends to occur in areas where people eat [[maize]] (corn, the only grain low in digestible niacin) as a staple food.  A special cooking technique called [[nixtamalization]] is needed to increase the bioavailability of niacin during maize meal/flour production.

Mild niacin deficiency has been shown to slow metabolism, causing decreased tolerance to cold.

Severe deficiency of niacin in the diet causes the disease [[pellagra]], which is characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia, as well as “Casal's necklace” lesions on the lower neck, hyperpigmentation, thickening of the skin, inflammation of the mouth and tongue, digestive disturbances, amnesia, delirium, and eventually death, if left untreated.<ref name="Prakash 581–584">{{cite journal|title=Rapid resolution of delusional parasitosis in pellagra with niacin augmentation therapy|journal=General Hospital Psychiatry|first=Ravi|last=Prakash|coauthors=Sachin Gandotra, Lokesh Kumar Singh, Basudeb Das, Anuja Lakra|volume=30|issue=6|pages=581–4|doi= 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2008.04.011|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T70-4T24FKB-D/2/f619871a3d1f1d626b775c84523d6d94|pmid=19061687|year=2008 }}</ref>  Common psychiatric symptoms of niacin deficiency include irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, fatigue, restlessness, apathy, and depression.<ref name="Prakash 581–584"/>  Studies have indicated that, in patients with alcoholic pellagra, niacin deficiency may be an important factor influencing both the onset and severity of this condition.  Patients with alcoholism typically experience increased intestinal permeability, leading to negative health outcomes<!--(Junqueira-Franco et al., 2006)-->.

Hartnup’s disease is a [[hereditary]] nutritional disorder resulting in niacin deficiency.<ref name="Prakash 581–584"/>  This condition was first identified in the 1950s by the Hartnup family in London.  It is due to a deficit in the intestines and kidneys, making it difficult for the body to break down and absorb dietary [[tryptophan]].  The resulting condition is similar to pellagra, including symptoms of red, scaly rash, and sensitivity to sunlight.  Oral niacin is given as a treatment for this condition in doses ranging from 40–200&nbsp;mg, with a good prognosis if identified and treated early.<ref name="Prakash 581–584"/> Niacin synthesis is also deficient in [[carcinoid syndrome]], because of metabolic diversion of its precursor [[tryptophan]] to form [[serotonin]].

By lowering VLDL levels, niacin also increases the level of [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL) or "good" cholesterol in blood, and therefore it is sometimes prescribed for people with low HDL, who are also at high risk of a heart attack.<ref name="pmid15842130">{{cite journal |author=McGovern ME |title=Taking aim at HDL-C.

However, a 2011 study ([[AIM-HIGH]]) was halted early because patients showed no decrease in cardiovascular events, but did experience an increase in the risk of stroke. These patients already had LDL levels well controlled by a [[statin]] drug, and the aim of the study was to evaluate extended-release niacin (2000&nbsp;mg per day) to see if raising HDL levels had an additional positive effect on risk. In this study, it did not have such an effect, and appeared to increase stroke risk.<ref>{{cite pmid | 22085343}}</ref> The role of niacin in patients whose LDL is not well-controlled (as in the majority of previous studies with niacin) is still under study and debate.

==Niacin prescriptions==
Different niacin prescriptions are in the market.  Immediate release that is quickly absorbed has more flushing effect and less hepatotoxic. Extended release (Niapsen) with more balanced metabolism which absorbs in 8–12 hours and results in less flushing and lower hepatotoxicity. New Niapsen called R-Niapsen has even lower flushing intensity and duration and could be consumed with aspirin. [[Laropiprant]] (Merck & Co., Inc.) is another recent niacin formulation with prostaglandin D2 binding capacity that mediated vaso-dilation and reduced flushing up to 73%<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17392721 | year = 2007 | last1 = Lai | first1 = E | last2 = De Lepeleire | first2 = I | last3 = Crumley | first3 = TM | last4 = Liu | first4 = F | last5 = Wenning | first5 = LA | last6 = Michiels | first6 = N | last7 = Vets | first7 = E | last8 = O'Neill | first8 = G | last9 = Wagner | first9 = JA | title = Suppression of niacin-induced vasodilation with an antagonist to prostaglandin D2 receptor subtype 1 | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 849–57 | doi = 10.1038/sj.clpt.6100180 | journal = Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics}}</ref> that has been approved in Europe but awaiting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.<ref name="Villines, T.

==Toxicity==
Pharmacological doses of niacin (1.5 - 6 g per day) lead to side effects that can include dermatological conditions such as [[Flushing (physiology)|skin flushing]] and itching, dry skin, and skin rashes including [[eczema]] exacerbation and [[acanthosis nigricans]]. Some of these symptoms are generally related to niacin's role as the rate limiting cofactor in the histidine decarboxylase enzyme which converts l-histidine into histamine.{{Citation needed|reason=histidine decarboxylase is B6-dependent, not B3-dependent|date=May 2011}} H1 and H2 receptor mediated histamine is metabolized via a sequence of mono (or di-) amine oxidase and COMT into methylhistamine which is then conjugated through the liver's [[CYP450]] pathways. Persistent flushing and other symptoms may indicate deficiencies in one or more of the cofactors responsible for this enzymatic cascade. Gastrointestinal complaints, such as [[dyspepsia]] (indigestion), nausea and liver toxicity [[fulminant hepatic failure]], have also been reported. Side effects of [[hyperglycemia]], [[cardiac arrhythmias]] and "birth defects in experimental animals" have also been reported.<ref name=G&G>{{cite book |author=Keith Parker; Laurence Brunton; Goodman, Louis Sanford; Lazo, John S.; Gilman, Alfred |title=Goodman & Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-142280-3 }}</ref>

Flushing usually lasts for about 15 to 30 minutes, though it can sometimes last up to two hours. It is sometimes accompanied by a prickly or itching sensation, in particular, in areas covered by clothing. Flushing is mediated by prostaglandin E2 and D2 due to GPR109A activation of epidermal langerhans’ cells and keratinocytes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16322797 | year = 2005 | last1 = Benyó | first1 = Z | last2 = Gille | first2 = A | last3 = Kero | first3 = J | last4 = Csiky | first4 = M | last5 = Suchánková | first5 = MC | last6 = Nüsing | first6 = RM | last7 = Moers | first7 = A | last8 = Pfeffer | first8 = K | last9 = Offermanns | first9 = S | title = GPR109A (PUMA-G/HM74A) mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing | volume = 115 | issue = 12 | pages = 3634–40 | doi = 10.1172/JCI23626 | pmc = 1297235 | journal = The Journal of clinical investigation}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17008386 | year = 2006 | last1 = Benyó | first1 = Z | last2 = Gille | first2 = A | last3 = Bennett | first3 = CL | last4 = Clausen | first4 = BE | last5 = Offermanns | first5 = S | title = Nicotinic acid-induced flushing is mediated by activation of epidermal langerhans cells | volume = 70 | issue = 6 | pages = 1844–9 | doi = 10.1124/mol.106.030833 | journal = Molecular pharmacology}}</ref> Langerhans use cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1) for PGE2 production and are more responsible for acute flushing while keratinocutes are COX-2 dependent and are in active continued vaso-dilation.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20664170 | year = 2010 | last1 = Hanson | first1 = J | last2 = Gille | first2 = A | last3 = Zwykiel | first3 = S | last4 = Lukasova | first4 = M | last5 = Clausen | first5 = BE | last6 = Ahmed | first6 = K | last7 = Tunaru | first7 = S | last8 = Wirth | first8 = A | last9 = Offermanns | first9 = S | title = Nicotinic acid- and monomethyl fumarate-induced flushing involves GPR109A expressed by keratinocytes and COX-2-dependent prostanoid formation in mice | volume = 120 | issue = 8 | pages = 2910–9 | doi = 10.1172/JCI42273 | pmc = 2912194 | journal = The Journal of clinical investigation}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17008871 | year = 2006 | last1 = Maciejewski-Lenoir | first1 = D | last2 = Richman | first2 = JG | last3 = Hakak | first3 = Y | last4 = Gaidarov | first4 = I | last5 = Behan | first5 = DP | last6 = Connolly | first6 = DT | title = Langerhans cells release prostaglandin D2 in response to nicotinic acid | volume = 126 | issue = 12 | pages = 2637–46 | doi = 10.1038/sj.jid.5700586 | journal = The Journal of investigative dermatology}}</ref> To reduce flushing many studies focused on altering or blocking the prostaglandin mediated pathway.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18375237 | year = 2008 | last1 = Kamanna | first1 = VS | last2 = Kashyap | first2 = ML | title = Mechanism of action of niacin | volume = 101 | issue = 8A | pages = 20B–26B | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029 | journal = The American journal of cardiology}}</ref> This effect is mediated by [[GPR109A]]-mediated [[prostaglandin]] release from the [[Langerhans cells]] of the skin and can be blocked by taking 300&nbsp;mg of [[aspirin]] half an hour before taking niacin, by taking one tablet of [[ibuprofen]] per day or by co-administering the [[prostaglandin receptor]] [[antagonist]] [[laropiprant]].

==Nicotinamide==
Nicotinamide may be obtained from the diet where it is present primarily as NAD+ and NADP+. These are hydrolysed in the intestine and the resulting nicotinamide is absorbed either as such, or following its hydrolysis to nicotinic acid. Nicotinamide is present in nature in only small amounts. In unprepared foods, niacin is present mainly in the form of the cellular pyridine nucleotides NAD and NADP. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the co-enzymes can occur during the course of food preparation. Boiling releases most of the total niacin present in sweet corn as nicotinamide (up to 55&nbsp;mg/kg).<ref name="efsa.europa.eu">{{cite journal | journal = The EFSA Journal | year = 2009 | volume = 949 | pages = 1–20 | title = Inositol hexanicotinate (inositol hexaniacinate) as a source of niacin (vitamin B3) added for nutritional purposes in food supplements | author = F.

==Inositol hexanicotinate==
One form of dietary supplement is inositol hexanicotinate (IHN), which is [[inositol]] that has been [[ester]]ified with niacin on all six of inositol's alcohol groups. IHN is usually sold as "flush-free" or "no-flush" niacin in units of 250, 500, or 1000&nbsp;mg/tablets or capsules. It is sold as an over-the-counter formulation, and often is marketed and labeled as niacin, thus misleading consumers into thinking they are getting the active form of the medication.  While this form of niacin does not cause the flushing associated with the immediate-release products, the evidence that it has lipid-modifying functions is contradictory, at best. As the clinical trials date from the early 1960s (Dorner, Welsh) or the late 1970s (Ziliotto, Kruse, Agusti), it is difficult to assess them by today's standards.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/447528 | title = No-Flush Niacin for the Treatment of Hyperlipidemia | last = Taheri | first = R | publisher = [[Medscape]] | date = 2003-01-15 | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}</ref> One of the last of those studies affirmed the superiority of inositol and xantinol esters of nicotinic acid for reducing serum free fatty acid,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kruse W, Kruse W, Raetzer H, Heuck CC, Oster P, Schellenberg B, Schlierf G | title=Nocturnal inhibition of lipolysis in man by nicotinic acid and derivatives | journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume=16 | issue=1 | year=1979 | pages=11–15  | pmid=499296 | doi=10.1007/BF00644960 }}</ref> but other studies conducted during the same period found no benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Meyers CD, Carr MC, Park S, Brunzell JD | title=Varying cost and free nicotinic acid content in over-the-counter niacin preparations for dyslipidemia | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | volume=139 | issue=12 | year=2003 | pages=996–1002 | url = http://www.annals.org/content/139/12/996.full.pdf+html | pmid=14678919 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-139-12-200312160-00009 }}</ref> Studies explain that this is primarily because "flush-free" preparations do not contain any free nicotinic acid.

Furthermore, the American Heart Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program both take the position that only prescription niacin should be used to treat dyslipidemias, and only under the management of a physician. The reason given is that niacin at effective intakes of 1500–3000&nbsp;mg/day can also potentially have severe adverse effects. Thus [[liver function tests]] to monitor liver enzymes are necessary when taking therapeutic doses of niacin, including [[alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP), [[aspartate transaminase]] (AST), and [[alanine transaminase]] (ALT).

==Biosynthesis and chemical synthesis==
[[Image:Tryptophan metabolism.png|thumb|400px|Biosynthesis]]
The [[liver]] can synthesize niacin from the essential [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]], requiring 60 [[Gram#SI multiples|mg]] of tryptophan to make one mg of niacin.<ref name=OSU>{{cite web | url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/niacin/ | title = Niacin | publisher = [[Linus Pauling Institute]] | year = 2007 | last = Jacobson | first = EL | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}</ref>  The 5-membered [[aromatic]] [[heterocyclic compound|heterocycle]] of tryptophan is cleaved and rearranged with the [[amino acid|alpha amino group]] of tryptophan into the 6-membered aromatic heterocycle of niacin. [[Riboflavin]], [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] and [[iron]] are required in some of the reactions involved in the conversion of tryptophan to NAD.

Several million kilograms of niacin are manufactured each year, starting from [[3-Methylpyridine|3-methylpyridine]].

==Receptor==
In addition to its effects as NAD and NADP, niacin may have additional effects by [[receptor activation]]. The receptor for niacin is a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] called HM74A.<ref name="pmid16018973">{{cite journal |author=Zhang Y, Schmidt RJ, Foxworthy P, ''et al.'' |title=Niacin mediates lipolysis in adipose tissue through its G-protein coupled receptor HM74A |journal=Biochem.

==History==
Niacin was first described by chemist [[Hugo Weidel]] in 1873 in his studies of [[nicotine]].<ref>{{cite journal | first = H | last = Weidel | title = Zur Kenntniss des Nicotins | journal = Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie | year = 1873 | volume = 165 | pages = 330–349 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18731650212 | issue = 2}}</ref>  The original preparation remains useful: The oxidation of [[nicotine]] using [[nitric acid]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = [[Samuel M. McElvain]] | title = Nicotinic Acid | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 385| year = 1941 | prep = CV1P0385.pdf}}</ref> Niacin was extracted from livers by biochemist [[Conrad Elvehjem]] in 1937, who later identified the active ingredient, then referred to as the "pellagra-preventing factor" and the "anti-blacktongue factor."<ref name=Elvehjem>{{cite journal |author=Elvehjem CA, Madden RJ, Strongandd FM, Woolley DW |year=1938 |title=The isolation and identification of the anti-blacktongue factor J |journal = J. Biol. Chem. |volume=123 |pages=137–149 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/123/1/137.full.pdf |format=PDF |issue=1}}</ref> Soon after, in studies conducted in Alabama and Cincinnati, Dr. [[Tom Spies]] found that nicotinic acid cured the sufferers of pellagra.<ref>[http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/goldberger/docs/ashes_7.htm Dr. Joseph Goldberger and the war on Pellagra - Office of NIH History]</ref>

When the biological significance of nicotinic acid was realized, it was thought appropriate to choose a name to dissociate it from nicotine, to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin-rich food contains nicotine, or that cigarettes contain vitamins. The resulting name 'niacin' was derived from '''ni'''cotinic '''ac'''id + vitam'''in.'''

Carpenter found in 1951 that niacin in corn is biologically unavailable, and can be released only in very alkaline lime water of [[pH]] 11.<ref name="pmid14880960">{{cite journal |author=LAGUNA J, CARPENTER KJ |title=Raw versus processed corn in niacin-deficient diets |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=21–8 |year=1951 |month=September |pmid=14880960 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14880960}}</ref>
This process, known as [[nixtamalization]], was discovered by the prehistoric civilizations of Mesoamerica.<ref name=UMM>{{cite web | url = http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/vitamin-b3-000335.htm | title = Vitamin B3 | publisher =  [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland Medical Center]] | date = 2002-01-04 | accessdate = 2008-03-31 }}</ref>

Niacin is referred to as vitamin B<sub>3</sub> because it was the third of the [[B vitamins]] to be discovered. It has historically been referred to as "vitamin PP" or "vitamin P-P".

==Research==
{{as of|August 2008}}, a combination of niacin with [[laropiprant]] is being tested in a clinical trial. Laropiprant reduces facial flushes induced by niacin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paolini JF, Bays HE, Ballantyne CM, ''et al.'' |title=Extended-release niacin/laropiprant: reducing niacin-induced flushing to better realize the benefit of niacin in improving cardiovascular risk factors |journal=Cardiol Clin |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=547–60 |date=November 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.ccl.2008.06.007 |pmid=19031552 }}</ref>
