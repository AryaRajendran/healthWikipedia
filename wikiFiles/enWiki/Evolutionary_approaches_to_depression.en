[[Evolutionary psychology]] has proposed several different evolutionary explanations for [[Mood disorder|depression]].

== Background ==
[[major depressive disorder|Major depression]] is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and in 2000 was the fourth leading contributor to the global burden of disease (measured in [[Disability-adjusted life years|DALYs]]); it is also an important risk factor for suicide.<ref name=WHO>{{Cite document| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=The World Health Report 2001| title=Health Systems: Improving Performance| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=World Health Organization| place=Geneva| pages=| date=| year=2001| id= | contribution-url=| format=| accessdate=2008-03-22| postscript= <!--None--> }}</ref> It is understandable, then, that clinical depression is thought to be a pathology — a major dysfunction of the brain.

In most cases, rates of organ dysfunction increase with age, with low rates in adolescents and young adults, and the highest rates in the elderly.<ref name="CDC">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5606a2.htm |title=Prevalence of Heart Disease --- United States, 2005 |accessdate=2008-03-22 |work=}}{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5608a2.htm |title=Prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease and Associated Risk Factors --- United States, 1999--2004 |accessdate=2008-03-22 |work=}}</ref> These patterns are consistent with [[Senescence|evolutionary theories of aging]] which posit that selection against dysfunctional traits decreases with age (because there is a decreasing probability of surviving to later ages).

In contrast to these patterns, prevalence of clinical depression is high in all age categories, including otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults. In one study of the US population, for example, the 12 month prevalence for a major depression episode was highest in the youngest age category (15–24 year olds).<ref name="pmid8300981">{{cite journal |author=Kessler RC, McGonagle KA, Swartz M, Blazer DG, Nelson CB |title=Sex and depression in the National Comorbidity Survey.

The common occurrence and persistence of a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] like clinical depression with such negative effects early in life is difficult to explain. (Rates of infectious disease are high in young people, of course, but clinical depression is not thought to be caused by an infection.)  [[Evolutionary psychology]] and its application in [[evolutionary medicine]] suggest how behaviour and mental states, including seemingly harmful states such as depression, may have been beneficial adaptations of human ancestors which improved the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals or their [[kin selection|relatives]].<ref name="NeeseEvol">{{cite book | last = Neese | first = Randolph M. | authorlink = Randolph M.

The following [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] attempt to identify a benefit of depression that outweighs its obvious costs.

Such hypotheses are not necessarily incompatible with one another and may explain different aspects, causes, and symptoms of depression.<ref name=AllenBadcock2006>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.007}}</ref>

==Psychic pain hypothesis==
One reason depression is thought to be a pathology is that it causes so much psychic pain and distress. However, [[pain|physical pain]] is also very distressful, yet it has an evolved function: to inform the organism that it is suffering damage, to motivate it to withdraw from the source of damage, and to learn to avoid such damage-causing circumstances in the future.

According to the psychic pain hypothesis, depression is analogous to physical pain in that it informs the sufferer that current circumstances, such as the loss of a friend, are imposing a threat to [[Fitness (biology)|biological fitness]], it motivates the sufferer to cease activities that led to the costly situation, if possible, and it causes him or her to learn to avoid similar circumstances in the future. Proponents of this view tend to focus on [[dysthymia|low mood]], and regard clinical depression as a dysfunctional extreme of low mood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thornhill NW, Thornhill R |title=An evolutionary analysis of psychological pain following human (Homo sapiens) rape: IV.

==Behavioral shutdown model==
A similar theory to the psychic pain hypothesis. If an organism faces more risk or expenditure than reward from activities, the best evolutionary strategy may be to withdraw from them.  The behavioral shutdown model proposes that emotional pain, like physical pain, serves a useful adaptive purpose.  Negative emotions like disappointment, sadness, grief, fear, anxiety, anger, and guilt are described as "evolved strategies that allow for the identification and avoidance of specific problems, especially in the social domain."  Depression is characteristically associated with [[anhedonia]] and lack of energy, and those experiencing it are risk-aversive and perceive more negative and pessimistic outcomes because they are focused on preventing further loss.  Although the model views depression as an adaptive response, it does not suggest that it is beneficial by the standards of current society; but it does suggest that many approaches to depression treat symptoms rather than causes, and underlying social problems need to be addressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/BSM%20Final.pdf|title=Depression: disease or behavioral shutdown mechanism|author=Gregg Henriques|publisher=Journal of Science and Health Policy}}</ref>

==Analytical rumination hypothesis==
This hypothesis suggests that depression is an adaptation that causes the affected individual to concentrate his or her attention and focus on a complex problem in order to analyze and solve it.<ref name = Andrews2009>{{cite journal | author = Andrews, P.W.; Thompson, J.A. | year = 2009 | title = The bright side of being blue: depression as an adaptation for analyzing complex problems | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 116 | pages = 620–654 | doi = 10.1037/a0016242 | pmid = 19618990 | issue = 3 | pmc = 2734449}}</ref>

One way depression increases the individual’s focus on a problem is by inducing rumination. Depression activates the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which increases attention control and maintains problem-related information in an “active, accessible state” referred to as “working memory,” or WM. As a result, depressed individuals have been shown to ruminate, reflecting on the reasons for their current problems. Feelings of regret associated with depression also cause individuals to reflect and analyze past events in order to determine why they happened and how they could have been prevented.<ref name = Andrews2009/>

Another way depression increases an individual’s ability to concentrate on a problem is  by reducing distraction from the problem. For example, anhedonia, which is often associated with depression, decreases an individual’s desire to participate in activities that provide short-term rewards, and instead, allows the individual to concentrate on long-term goals. In addition, “psychomotory changes,” such as solitariness, decreased appetite, and insomnia also reduce distractions. For instance, insomnia enables conscious analysis of the problem to be maintained by preventing sleep from disrupting such processes. Likewise, solitariness, lack of physical activity, and lack of appetite all eliminate sources of distraction, such as social interactions, navigation through the environment,<ref name = Andrews2009/> and “oral activity,”  which disrupt stimuli from being processed.<ref name = Jacobs1999>{{cite journal |  author = Jacobs, B.L.; Fornal, C.A. | year = 1999 | title = Activity of serotonergic neurons in behaving animals | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 21 | page= S9–S15 | doi= 10.1038/sj.npp.1395336 }}</ref>

==Possibilities of depression as a dysregulated adaptation==
Depression, especially in the modern context, may not necessarily be adaptive. The ability to feel pain and experience depression, are adaptive defense mechanisms,<ref name = Gilbert2006>{{cite journal|author=Gilbert, P. |year=2006|title= Evolution and depression: issues and implications|journal= Psychological Medicine |volume=36|pages=287–297|doi=10.1017/S0033291705006112|pmid=16236231|issue=3}}</ref> but when they are “too easily triggered, too intense, or long lasting,” they can become “dysregulated.”<ref name=Gilbert2006/> In such a case, defense mechanisms, too, can become diseases, such as “chronic pain or dehydration from diarrhea.” Depression, which may be a similar kind of defense mechanism, may have become dysregulated as well.<ref name = Nesse2000>{{cite journal | author = Nesse, R.M. | year = 2000 | title = Is Depression an Adaptation? | journal = Archives of General Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages= 14–20 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.57.1.14 | pmid=10632228}}</ref>

Thus, unlike other evolutionary theories this one sees depression as a maladaptive extreme of something that is beneficial in smaller amounts. In particular, one theory focuses on the personality trait [[neuroticism]]. Low amounts of neuroticism may increase a person's fitness through various processes, but too much may reduce fitness by, for example, recurring depressions. Thus, evolution will select for an optimal amount and most people will have neuroticism near this amount. However, genetic variation continually occurs, and some people will have high neuroticism which increases the risk of depressions.<ref name=AllenBadcock2006/>

==Rank theory==
[[Rank theory of depression|Rank theory]] is the hypothesis that, if an individual is involved in a lengthy fight for [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance]] in a social group and is clearly losing, then depression causes the individual to back down and accept the [[Submission|submissive]] role.  In doing so, the individual is protected from unnecessary harm.  In this way, depression helps maintain a [[social hierarchy]]. This theory is a special case of a more general theory derived from the psychic pain hypothesis: that the cognitive response that produces modern-day depression evolved as a mechanism that allows people to assess whether they are in pursuit of an unreachable [[goal]], and if they are, to motivate them to desist.<ref name="NeeseAdapt" /><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=toRX7Zyo_pMC|title=Depression: The Evolution of Powerlessness|author=Paul Gilbert|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1992|isbn=0-86377-221-8}}</ref>

==Social risk hypothesis==
This hypothesis is similar to the rank hypothesis but focuses more on general social approval in a group rather than direct dominance contests. To maintain social ties was critical for survival and reproduction. During the Pleistocene period, for instance, such social ties were vital in food foraging and protection from predators.<ref name = "Allen and Badcock">{{cite journal | author = Allen, N.B.; Badcock, P.B. | year = 2006 | title = Darwinian models of depression: a review of evolutionary accounts of mood and mood disorders | journal = Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychology | volume = 30 | pages = 815–826 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.007 | pmid = 16647176 | issue = 5}}</ref>

Depression, resulting from one’s loss of what one approach calls "Social Attention Holding Power," or SAHP, may have signalled the individual's submissiveness to the more dominant males of the social group through associated symptoms, such as low confidence and anxiety.<ref name = "Allen and Badcock"/> This, in turn, reduced tension among group members, and enabled bonds to be maintained. Secondly, depression may also have served to signal other members of an individual’s need for aid <ref name = "Allen and Badcock"/> and desire to reform lost bonds.<ref name = Averill1968>{{cite journal | author = Averill, J.R. | year = 1968 | title = Grief: its nature and significance | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 70 | pages= 721–748 | doi = 10.1037/h0026824 | pmid = 4889573 | issue = 6}}</ref>

==Honest signaling theory==
{{See also|Signalling theory}}
Another reason depression is thought to be a pathology is that key symptoms, such as loss of interest in virtually all activities, are extremely costly to the sufferer. Biologists and economists have proposed, however, that [[Signaling game|signals with inherent costs]] can credibly signal information when there are [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. In the wake of a serious negative life event, such as those that have been implicated in depression (e.g., death, divorce), "cheap" signals of need, such as crying, might not be believed when social partners have conflicts of interest.  The symptoms of major depression, such as loss of interest in virtually all activities and [[Suicide|suicidality]], are inherently costly, but, as costly signaling theory requires, the costs differ for individuals in different states. For individuals who are not genuinely in need, the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] cost of major depression is very high because it threatens the flow of fitness benefits. For individuals who are in genuine need, however, the fitness cost of major depression is low, because the individual is not generating many fitness benefits. Thus, only an individual in genuine need can afford to suffer major depression.  Major depression therefore serves as an honest, or credible, signal of need.

For example, individuals suffering a severe loss such as the death of a [[Marriage|spouse]] are often in need of help and assistance from others. Such individuals who have few conflicts with their social partners are predicted to experience grief—a means, in part, to signal need to others. Such individuals who have many conflicts with their social partners, in contrast, are predicted to experience depression—a means, in part, to ''credibly'' signal need to others who might be skeptical that the need is genuine.<ref name=Hagen2003>{{cite journal | author = Hagen, E.H. | year = 2003

==Bargaining theory==
Depression is not only costly to the sufferer, it also imposes a significant burden on family, friends, and society at large—yet another reason it is thought to be pathological. Yet if sufferers of depression have real but unmet needs, they might have to provide an incentive to others to address those needs.

The bargaining theory of depression is similar to the honest signaling, niche change, and social navigation theories of depression described above. It draws on theories of labor strikes developed by economists to basically add one additional element to honest signaling theory: The fitness of social partners is generally correlated. When a wife suffers depression and reduces her investment in offspring, for example, the husband's fitness is also put at risk. Thus, not only do the symptoms of major depression serve as costly and therefore honest signals of need, they also compel reluctant social partners to respond to that need in order to prevent their own fitness from being reduced.<ref name=Hagen1999/><ref name=Hagen2003/><ref name=Hagen2002>{{cite journal | author = Hagen, E.H. | year = 2002 | title = Depression as bargaining The case postpartum | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 323–336 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513801001027  | accessdate = 2008-02-28 | doi = 10.1016/S1090-5138(01)00102-7}}</ref>

==Social navigation or niche change theory==
The social navigation or niche change hypothesis <ref name=Watson2002/><ref name=WatsonWebPage>[http://biology.unm.edu/Biology/pwatson/public_html/dp1.htm Watson, Paul J. "An Evolutionary Adaptationist Theory of Unipolar Depression: Depression as an adaptation for social navigation, especially for overcoming costly contractual constraints of the individual's social niche"]</ref> combines the analytical rumination and bargaining hypotheses and suggests that depression, operationally defined as a combination of prolonged [[anhedonia]] and [[psychomotor retardation]] or agitation, provides a focused sober perspective on socially imposed constraints hindering a person’s pursuit of major fitness enhancing projects. Simultaneously, publicly displayed symptoms, which reduce the depressive's ability to conduct basic life activities, serve as a [[Signalling theory|social signal]] of need; the signal's costliness for the depressive certifies its honesty. Finally, for social partners who find it uneconomical to respond helpfully to an honest signal of need, the same depressive symptoms also have the potential to extort relevant concessions and compromises. Depression’s extortionary power comes from the fact that it retards the flow of just those goods and services such partners have come to expect from the depressive under status quo socioeconomic arrangements.

Thus depression may be a social [[adaptation]] especially useful in motivating a variety of social partners, all at once, to help the depressive initiate major fitness-enhancing changes in their socioeconomic life. There are diverse circumstances under which this may become necessary in human social life, ranging from loss of rank or a key social ally which makes the current social niche uneconomic to having a set of creative new ideas about how to make a livelihood which begs for a new niche. The social navigation hypothesis emphasizes that an individual can become tightly ensnared in an overly restrictive matrix of social exchange contracts, and that this situation sometimes necessitates a radical contractual upheaval that is beyond conventional methods of negotiation. Regarding the treatment of depression, this hypothesis calls into question any assumptions by the clinician that the typical cause of depression is related to [[Adaptive behavior|maladaptive]] perverted thinking processes or other purely endogenous sources. The social navigation hypothesis calls instead for analysis of the depressive’s talents and dreams, identification of relevant social constraints (especially those with a relatively diffuse non-point source within the social network of the depressive), and practical social [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] [[Psychotherapy|therapy]] designed to relax those constraints enough to allow the depressive to move forward with their life under an improved set of social contracts.<ref name=Watson2002/><ref name=WatsonWebPage/> This theory has been the subject of criticism.<ref name=Nettle2004/>

==Prevention of infection==
It has been hypothesized that depression is an evolutionary adaptation because it helps prevent [[infection]] in both the affected individual and his/her kin.<ref name = "Kinney and Tanaka">{{cite journal | author = Kinney, D.K.; Tanaka, M. | year = 2009 | title = An evolutionary hypothesis of depression and its symptoms, adaptive values, and risk factors | journal = Journal of  Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 197 | pages = 561–567 | doi = 10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181b05fa8 | pmid = 19684491 | issue = 8}}</ref> <ref>Raison, C.L, Miller, A. N. (2012).  The evolutionary significance of depression in Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) Molecular Psychiatry  1-23.  [http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/mp20122a.pdf PDF]. </ref>

First, the associated symptoms of depression, such as inactivity and lethargy, encourage the affected individual to rest. Energy conserved through such methods is highly crucial, as immune activation against infections is relatively costly; there must be, for instance, a 10% increase in metabolic activity for even a 1℃ change in body temperature.<ref name = Kluger1991>{{cite journal | author = Kluger, M.J. | year = 1991 | title = Fever: Role of pyrogens and cryogens | journal = Physiological Review | volume = 71 | pages = 93–127}}</ref> Therefore, depression allows one to conserve and allocate energy to the immune system more efficiently. 

Depression further prevents infection by discouraging social interactions and activities that may result in exchange of infections. For example, the loss of interest discourages one from engaging in sexual activity, which, in turn, prevents the exchange of sexually transmitted diseases. Similarly, depressed mothers may interact less with their children, reducing the probability of the mother infecting her kin.<ref name = "Kinney and Tanaka"/>
Lastly, the lack of appetite associated with depression may also reduce exposure to food-borne parasites.<ref name = "Kinney and Tanaka"/>

It further proposes that this response is mediated by the acute release of an unknown (probably [[cytokine]]) inflammatory agent into the third ventricular space.
