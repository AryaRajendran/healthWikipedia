The '''tegmental pontine reticular nucleus''' (or '''pontine reticular nucleus of the [[tegmentum]]''') is an area within the floor of the [[midbrain]]. This area is known to affect the cerebellum with its axonal projections. 

These efferent connections have been proven to project not only ipsilaterally, but also to [[decussate]] and project to the contralateral side of the [[vermis]]. 

It has also been shown that the projections from the tegmenti pontis to the [[cerebellar lobes]] are only crossed fibers. 

The n.r. tegmenti pontis also receives afferent axons from the [[cerebellum]]. 

This nucleus is known for its large amount of [[multipolar cells]] and its particularly reticular structure. 

The n.r. tegmenti pontis is topographically related to pontine nuclei (non-reticular), being just dorsal to them. 

The nucleus reticularis has been known to mediate eye movements, otherwise known as so-called [[saccadic]] movement. This makes sense concerning their connections, as it would require a nucleus that receives and projects to the cerebellum to mediate that kind of complex circuitry. Furthermore, in terms of behavior, one does not ''think'' about saccadic movements when scanning a room, as the saccadic movements are not directly controlled by the cortex.  

The pontine nuclei are the most traditionally studied mostly because it is easy to see which nuclei degrade when the cerebellum is amputated. 

The neurons of the lateral reticular formation are very important for reflexes and the mediation of [[Human position|posture]]. It has been shown in cats that electrical stimulation of the reticular formation can make a standing [[cat]] lie down. Also, stimulation of the cat  in an alternative spot can make a lying cat stand.
