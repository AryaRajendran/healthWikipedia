An '''e-patient''' (also known as '''Internet patient''', or '''Internet-savvy patient''') is a health consumer who uses the Internet to gather information about a medical condition of particular interest to them, and who use electronic communication tools (including Web 2.0 tools) in coping with medical conditions.<ref name="web">{{cite journal |author=Masters K, Ng'ambi D, Todd, G |title="I Found it on the Internet:" Preparing for the e-patient in Oman |journal=SQU Med J |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=169–179 |year=2010 |

Health searches and email have become more commonplace, but there is room for improvement in searches and overall Internet access.]</ref>

As use of the term e-Patient has evolved, there has been less emphasis on Internet access and technology, and a contention<ref>deBronkart, Dave, [http://www.slideshare.net/osumedicalcenter/epatients-empowered-engaged-equipped-enabled E-Patients: Empowered, Engaged, Equipped, Enabled]. 2010 talk.</ref> that the "e" in "e-patient" stands for "empowered, engaged, equipped, enabled."

e-Patients are increasingly active in their care and are demonstrating the power of the [[Participatory Medicine]] or '''[[Health 2.0]] / [[Medicine 2.0]]'''.<ref>Eysenbach G [http://www.jmir.org/2008/3/e22/ Medicine 2.0: Social Networking, Collaboration, Participation, Apomediation, and Openness].

The proportion of e-patients in selected patient populations seem to be highest in the US and Canada.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} European countries seem to lag.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
