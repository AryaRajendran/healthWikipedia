'''Livedo reticularis''' is a common skin finding consisting of a mottled reticulated vascular pattern that appears like a lace-like purplish discoloration of the skin.<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|1615}} The discoloration is caused by swelling of the venules owing to obstruction of capillaries by thrombi. It can be caused by any condition that makes venules swell. 

The condition may be normal or may be related to more severe underlying [[pathology]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954346|livedo reticularis}}</ref> It has a broad differential diagnosis, broadly divided into possible blood diseases, autoimmune (rheumatologic) diseases, heart (cardiovascular) diseases, cancers, and endocrine disorders. It can usually (in 80% of cases) be diagnosed by biopsy.<ref>Case 5-2009: A 47-year-old woman with a rash and numbness and pain in the legs, N Engl J Med 2009;360:711-20</ref>

It may be aggravated by exposure to cold and occurs most often in the lower extremities.

The condition's name derives from the [[Latin]] ''livere'' meaning bluish and ''reticular'' which refers to the net-like appearance.

==Etiology==
A number of conditions may cause the appearance of livedo reticularis:
* [[Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita]] a rare [[congenital]] condition
* [[Sneddon syndrome]] - association of Livedoid vasculitis and systemic vascular disorders, such as  strokes, due to underlying genetic cause.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sneddon I |title=Cerebro-Vascular Lesions And Livedo Reticularis |journal=Br J Dermatol |volume=77 |issue= |pages=180–5 |year=1965 | month=April |pmid=14278790 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1965.tb14628.x}}</ref>
* '''Idiopathic livedo reticularis''' - the most common form of livedo reticularis and is a completely benign condition of unknown cause affecting mostly young women during the winter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gibbs M, English J, Zirwas M |title=Livedo reticularis: an update |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=1009–19 |year=2005 |pmid=15928620 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2004.11.051}}</ref> It is a lacy purple appearance of skin in extremities due to sluggish venous blood flow.  It may be mild, but ulceration may occur later in the summer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feldaker M, Hines E, Kierland R |title=Livedo reticularis with summer ulcerations |journal=AMA Arch Derm |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |year=1955 |pmid=14387292}}</ref>

*** Assc with Acute Renal Failure due to cholesterol emboli status post cardiac cath.
*** [[Arteriosclerosis]] ([[cholesterol emboli]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kazmier F, Sheps S, Bernatz P, Sayre G |title=Livedo reticularis and digital infarcts: a syndrome due to cholesterol emboli arising from atheromatous abdominal aortic aneurysms |journal=Vasc Dis |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=12–24 |year=1966 |pmid=5903590}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stewart W, Lauret P, Testart J, Thomine E, Boulliê M, Leroy D |title=[Cutaneous cholesterol emboli (author's transl)] |journal=Ann Dermatol Venereol |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |year=1977 | pmid= 843026}}</ref> and [[homocystinuria]] (due to [[Chromosome 21 (human)|Chromosome 21]] autosomal recessive [[Cystathionine beta synthase deficiency]])
*** Intra-arterial injection (especially in drug addicts)
** [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]] -- connective tissue disorder, often with many secondary conditions. Livedo Reticularis may be present in all types.

==Treatment==
Other than identifying and treating any underlying conditions in secondary livedo,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fleischer A, Resnick S |title=Livedo reticularis |journal=Dermatol Clin |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=347–54 |year=1990 |pmid=2191805}}</ref> idiopathic livedo reticularis itself may improve with warming the legs, but once established the skin discolouration may become permanent.
