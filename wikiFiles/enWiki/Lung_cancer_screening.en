'''Lung cancer screening''' refers to strategies used to identify early [[lung cancer]]s before they cause symptoms, at a point where they are more likely to be curable. [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] refers to the use of medical tests to detect disease in asymptomatic people. Screening studies have only been done in high risk populations, such as smokers and workers with occupational exposure to certain substances. This is because radiation exposure from repeated screening studies could actually induce [[carcinogenesis|cancer formation]] in a small percentage of screened subjects, so this risk should be mitigated by a (relatively) high prevalence of lung cancer in the population being screened.

==Practice guidelines==
[[Clinical practice guideline]]s issued by the [[American College of Chest Physicians]] in 2007 recommended against routine screening for lung cancer because of a lack of evidence that such screening was effective.<ref name="pmid17873156">{{cite journal |author=Alberts WM |title=Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer Executive Summary: ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (2nd Edition) |journal= Chest|volume=132 |issue=3_suppl |pages=1S–19S |year=2007 |pmid=17873156 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-1860 |author2=American College of Chest Physicians}}</ref>

In 2004, a clinical practice guideline by the [[US Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) gave a [[Evidence-based medicine#Categories of recommendations|grade I recommendation]] indicating that "the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening asymptomatic persons for lung cancer".<ref name="pmid15126258">{{cite journal |author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |title=Lung cancer screening: recommendation statement |journal=Ann.

Following the National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening Trial, guidelines were released initially in 2012 by the [[National_Comprehensive_Cancer_Network|National Comprehensive Cancer Network]], an alliance of twenty one cancer centers in the United States.  Their consensus guidelines, which are regularly updated, support screening as a process, not a single test, and discuss risks and benefits of screening in high risk individuals within a comprehensive multidisciplinary program.  Screening is only recommended for individuals defined as high risk meeting specific criteria.  More details can be found in their [http://www.nccn.org/patients/patient_guidelines/lung_screening/index.html Patient Guidelines].  While lung cancer screening programs have been supported by the [http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#lung_screening NCCN], [http://iaslc.org/ International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)], [http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/news/new-lung-cancer-screening-guidelines-for-heavy-smokers American Cancer Society], [http://chicago2013.asco.org/asco-releases-clinical-evidence-review-lung-cancer-screening The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)], and other organizations, the screening CT is not typically covered by most insurers at the present time.

==Studies of efficacy==
Regular [[chest radiography]] and [[sputum]] examination programs were not effective in reducing mortality from lung cancer.<ref name="pmid14973979">{{cite journal |author=Manser RL, Irving LB, Stone C, Byrnes G, Abramson M, Campbell D |title=Screening for lung cancer |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |issue=1 |pages=CD001991 |year=2004 |pmid=14973979 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001991.pub2 |editor1-last=Manser |editor1-first=Renée}}</ref> Previous studies (Mayo Lung Project and Czechoslovakia lung cancer screening study, combining over 17,000 smokers) had shown that early detection of lung cancer was possible with such programs, but mortality was not improved. Simply detecting a tumor at an earlier stage may not necessarily lead to improved survival. For example, plain chest X-ray screening resulted in increased time from diagnosis of cancer until death and those cancers being detected by screening tended to be earlier stages. However, these patients continued to die at the same rate as those who are not screened.

===CT scans===
A [[computed tomography]] (CT) scan can uncover tumors not yet visible on an X-ray. This led to CT scanning being actively evaluated as a screening tool for lung cancer in high-risk patients. 

The [http://ielcap.org/ International Early Lung Cancer Action Project (I-ELCAP)] published the results of CT screening on over 31,000 high-risk patients in late 2006 in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.<ref name="pmid17065637">{{cite journal |author=Henschke CI, Yankelevitz DF, Libby DM, Pasmantier MW, Smith JP, Miettinen OS |title=Survival of patients with stage I lung cancer detected on CT screening |journal=N.

Historically, such stage I patients would have an expected 10-year survival of 88%. Critics of the I-ELCAP study point out that there was no randomization of patients (all received CT scans and there was no comparison group receiving only chest x-rays) and the patients were not actually followed out to 10 years post detection (the median followup was 40 months). Regardless of these shortcomings, it is generally recognized that the prognosis of lung cancer decreases dramatically when the disease is in late stage,<ref name="mountain">{{cite journal |author=Mountain CF |title=Revisions in the International System for Staging Lung Cancer |journal=Chest |volume=111 |issue=6 |pages=1710–7 |year=1997 |month=June |pmid=9187198 |doi= 10.1378/chest.111.6.1710|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9187198}}</ref><ref name="Inoue">{{cite journal |author=Inoue K |title=Prognostic assessment of 1310 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent complete resection from 1980 to 1993 |journal=J.

CT screening for lung cancer has already been extensively compared to chest x-ray screening in Japan.  Among over 6,800 subjects screened in Japan, 67% to 73% of CT-detected lung cancers were missed by chest x-ray, the same test used in the comparison group of some randomized controlled trials of lung cancer screening.<ref name="Kaneko">{{cite journal |author=Kaneko M |title=Peripheral lung cancer: screening and detection with low-dose spiral CT versus radiography |journal=Radiology |volume=201 |issue=3 |pages=798–802 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8939234 |doi= |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8939234 |author-separator=, |author2=Eguchi K |author3=Ohmatsu H |display-authors=3 |last4=Kakinuma |first4=R |last5=Naruke |first5=T |last6=Suemasu |first6=K |last7=Moriyama |first7=N}}</ref><ref name="Sone1998">{{cite journal |author=Sone S |title=Mass screening for lung cancer with mobile spiral computed tomography scanner |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9111 |pages=1242–5 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9643744 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)08229-9 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Takashima S |author3=Li F |display-authors=3 |last4=Yang |first4=Zhigang |last5=Honda |first5=Takayuki |last6=Maruyama |first6=Yuichiro |last7=Hasegawa |first7=Minoru |last8=Yamanda |first8=Takeshi |last9=Kubo |first9=Keishi}}</ref><ref name="Sone2001">{{cite journal |author=Sone S |title=Results of three-year mass screening programme for lung cancer using mobile low-dose spiral computed tomography scanner |journal=Br.

The National Cancer Institute' National Lung Screening Trial involved over 53,000 former and current heavy smokers aged 55 to 74, who either received three CT scans or three X-rays annually.<ref name=WSJresults /> Deaths in either group were then logged for up to five years.<ref name=WSJresults /> As of October 2010, 354 people in the CT scan group had died from lung cancer, versus 442 people in the X-ray group; in other words, deaths in the CT scan group of patients were 20.3% lower than in the X-ray group.<ref name=WSJresults>[http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101104-717833.html UPDATE: US Lung Cancer Screening Study Shows Benefit With CT Vs.
