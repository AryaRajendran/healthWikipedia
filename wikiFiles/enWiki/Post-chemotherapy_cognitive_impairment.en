'''Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment''' ('''PCCI''') (also known as '''chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction''', '''chemo brain''', or '''chemo fog''') describes the [[cognitive]] impairment that can result from [[chemotherapy]] treatment.  Approximately 20–30% of people who undergo chemotherapy experience some level of post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment. The phenomenon first came to light because of the large number of breast cancer survivors who complained of changes in memory, fluency, and other cognitive abilities that impeded their ability to function as they had pre-chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tannock IF, Ahles TA, Ganz PA, Van Dam FS |title=Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy for cancer: report of a workshop |journal=J.

Although the causes and existence of post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment have been a subject of debate, recent studies have confirmed that post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment is a real, measurable side effect of chemotherapy that appears in some patients.<ref name="pmid18230787">{{cite journal |author=Hede K |title=Chemobrain is real but may need new name |journal=J.

PCCI is often seen in patients treated for [[breast cancer]], [[ovarian cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], and other reproductive cancers<ref name="pmid16286908" />, as well as other types of cancers requiring agressive treatment with chemotherapy. <ref name="pmid17367288">{{cite journal |author=Ness KK, Gurney JG. |title=Adverse late effects of childhood cancer and its treatment on health and performance. |journal=Annu Rev Public Health. |volume=28 |pages=278-302 |year=2007 |pmid=17367288  |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144049 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144049}}</ref> <ref name="pmid23172518">{{cite journal |author=Baudino B, et. al. |title=The chemotherapy long-term effect on cognitive functions and brain metabolism in lymphoma patients. |journal=Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=559-568 |year=2012 |month=December |pmid=23172518 |url=http://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/nuclear-med-molecular-imaging/article.php?cod=R39Y2012N06A0559 }}</ref>

The clinical relevance of PCCI is significant, considering the increasing number of long-term cancer survivors in the population, many of whom may have been treated with aggressive [[dose (biochemistry)|dosing]] of chemotherapeutic agents, or with chemotherapy as an adjuvant to other forms of treatment.<ref name="pmid17906463">{{cite journal |author=Taillibert S, Voillery D, Bernard-Marty C |title=Chemobrain: is systemic chemotherapy neurotoxic? |journal=Curr Opin Oncol |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=623–7 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17906463 |doi=10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282f0e224 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00001622-200711000-00015}}</ref>  In some patients, fear of PCCI can impact treatment decisions.

PCCI affects a subset of [[cancer survivors]],<ref name="pmid17882646"/> though the overall [[epidemiology]] and [[prevalence]] is not well known and may depend on many factors.<ref name=Kann>{{cite journal |author=Kannarkat G, Lasher EE, Schiff D |title=Neurologic complications of chemotherapy agents |journal=Curr.

It generally affects about 10–40% of breast cancer patients, with higher rates among pre-menopausal women and patients who receive high-dose chemotherapy.<ref name="pmid16286908">{{cite journal |author=Matsuda T, Takayama T, Tashiro M, Nakamura Y, Ohashi Y, Shimozuma K |title=Mild cognitive impairment after adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients--evaluation of appropriate research design and methodology to measure symptoms |journal=Breast Cancer |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=279–87 |year=2005 |pmid=16286908 |doi= 10.2325/jbcs.12.279|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jbcs/12/4/279/_pdf }}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The systems of the body most affected by chemotherapy drugs include [[visual memory|visual]] and [[semantic memory]], [[attention]] and [[motor coordination]].<ref name=Nelson/>  These effects can impair a chemotherapy patient's ability to understand and make decisions regarding treatment, perform in [[school]] or [[employment]] and can reduce [[quality of life]].<ref name = Nelson/> Survivors often report difficulty multitasking, comprehending what they've just read, following the thread of a conversation, and retrieving words<ref>Book: "Your Brain After Chemo: A Practical Guide to Lifting the Fog and Getting Back Your Focus" by Dan Silverman, MD, PhD and Idelle Davidson (Da Capo Lifelong Books, 2009).

[[Breast cancer]] survivors who were treated with chemotherapy may find it harder to perform tasks than survivors whose treatment was surgical.  One study demonstrated that, a year after treatment, the brains of cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy had physically shrunk while those of people not treated with chemotherapy had not.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Inagaki M, Yoshikawa E, Matsuoka Y, ''et al.'' |title=Smaller regional volumes of brain gray and white matter demonstrated in breast cancer survivors exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy |journal=Cancer |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=146–56 |year=2007 |pmid=17131349 |doi=10.1002/cncr.22368}}</ref>

Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment comes as a surprise to many cancer survivors. Often, survivors think their lives will return to normal when the cancer is gone, only to find that the lingering effects of post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment impede their efforts. Working, connecting with loved ones, carrying out day-to-day tasks—all can be very challenging for an impaired brain. Although post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment appears to be temporary, it can be quite long-lived, with some cases lasting 10 years or more.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silverman DH, Dy CJ, Castellon SA, ''et al.'' |title=Altered frontocortical, cerebellar, and basal ganglia activity in adjuvant-treated breast cancer survivors 5–10 years after chemotherapy |journal=Breast Cancer Res. Treat. |volume=103 |issue=3 |pages=303–11 |year=2007 |pmid=17009108 |doi=10.1007/s10549-006-9380-z}}</ref>

==Proposed mechanisms==
The details of PCCI's causes and boundaries are not well known.<ref name="pmid17906463"/>  Two major theories have been advanced:<ref name="pmid16286908" /> the direct effect of chemotherapy drugs on the brain, and the role of hormones in nervous system health.

PCCI is complex and factors other than the chemotherapeutic agents may impact cognitive functioning.  [[Menopause]], the biological impact of a surgical procedure with [[anesthesia]], [[medication]]s prescribed in addition to the chemotherapy, [[genetic predisposition]], [[hormone therapy]], emotional states (including [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]), [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions and [[paraneoplastic syndrome]] may all co-occur and act as [[confounding]] factors in the study or experience of PCCI.<ref name="pmid17882646"/>

[[Bortezomib]] is known to cause reversible [[neuropathy]] to the [[sensory system|sensory]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s.<ref name=Kann/>  In most cases there is no known way of reducing the effects of chemotherapeutic agents related to [[taxane]]s, [[thalidomide]] and [[platinum]]-based compounds ([[oxaliplatin]] is a notable exception to the latter category—though it does cause PCCI its effects can be buffered by infusion of [[calcium]] and thought related to PCCI include the ability of the nerves to repair themselves, the ability of cells to excrete compounds, permeability of the [[blood–brain barrier]], damage done to [[DNA]] including shortening of [[telomere]]s and cellular [[oxidative stress]].<ref name = Kann/>

The importance of hormones, particularly estrogen, on cognitive function is underscored by the presence of cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients before chemotherapy is begun, the similarity of the cognitive impairments to several menopausal symptoms, the increased rate of PCCI in pre-menopausal women, and the fact that the symptoms can frequently be reversed by taking estrogen.<ref name="pmid16286908" />

Other theories suggest [[Vascular system|vascular]] injury, [[inflammation]], [[autoimmunity]], [[anemia]] and the presence of the epsilon 4 version of the [[apolipoprotein E]] [[gene]].<ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal |author=Nelson CJ, Nandy N, Roth AJ |title=Chemotherapy and cognitive deficits: mechanisms, findings, and potential interventions |journal=Palliat Support Care |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=273–80 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17969831 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Fifty-six of the 132 chemotherapy agents approved by the FDA have been reported to induce oxidative stress.<ref>Myers, J. S., Pierce, J., & Pazdernik, T. 2008. "Neurotoxicology of chemotherapy in relation to cyotkine release, the blood brain barrier, and cognitive impairment." "Oncology Nursing Forum", 35 (6): 916-920.</ref>  The drug [[doxorubicin]] (adriamycin) has been investigated as a PCCI-causing agent due to its production of [[reactive oxygen species]].<ref name="pmid17171703">{{cite journal |author=Joshi G, Hardas S, Sultana R, St Clair DK, Vore M, Butterfield DA |title=Glutathione elevation by gamma-glutamyl cysteine ethyl ester as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing oxidative stress in brain mediated by in vivo administration of adriamycin: Implication for chemobrain |journal=J.

Research has revealed that neural progenitor cells are particularly vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy agents. [[5-fluorouracil]] has been demonstrated to reduce the viability of neural progenitor cells by 55-70% at concentrations of 1 μM, whereas cancer cell lines exposed to 1 μM of 5-fluorouracil were unaffected.<ref>Han,R., Dietrich, J., Luebke, A., et. al. 2008. "Systematic 5-flouracil treatment causes a syndrome of delayed myelin destruction in the central nervous system." "Journal of Biology", 7 (4): 12.</ref>  Other chemotherapy agents such as BCNU, cisplatin, and cytarabine also displayed toxicity to progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro.<ref>Dietrich, J., Ruolan, H., Yang, Y., Margot, M. P., Noble, M. 2006. "CNS progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes are targets of chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo." "Journal of Biology", 5 (7): 22.</ref>  This is a concern because neural progenitor cells are the major dividing cell population in the brain, giving rise to neurons and glia.

Due to the critical role the [[hippocampus]] plays in memory, it has been the focus of various studies involving post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment. The hippocampus is one of the rare areas of the brain that exhibits [[neurogenesis]]. These new neurons created by the hippocampus are important for memory and learning and require a [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) to form. 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapy agent, has been shown to significantly reduce the levels of BDNF in the hippocampus of the rat.<ref>Mustafa, S., Walker, A., Bennett, G., & Wigmore, P. M. (2008). "5-flouracil chemotherapy affects spatial working memory and newborn neurons in the adult rat hippocampus." "The European Journal of Neuroscience", 28 (2): 323-330.</ref> Methotextrate an agent widely used in the chemotherapy treatment of breast cancer, has also displayed a long-lasting dose dependent decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation in the rat following a single intravenous injection of the drug.<ref>Seigers, R., Schagen, S. B., Beerling, W., Boogerd, W., et al. 2008. "Long-lasting suppression of hippocampal  cell proliferation and impaired cognitive performance by methotrexate in the rat." "Behavioral Brain Research", 186 (2): 168-175.</ref> This evidence suggests that chemotherapy agent toxicity to cells in the hippocampus may  be partially responsible for the memory declines experienced by some patients.

Deficits in visuo-spatial, visual-motor, and visual memory functions are among the symptoms seen in post-chemotherapy patients.<ref>Raffa, R. B. & Tallarida. 2010. "Effects on the visual system might contribute to some of the cognitive deficits of cancer chemotherapy-induced ‘chemo-fog’." "Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics", 35 (3): 249-255.</ref> There is evidence that this may be due to damage to the visual system rather than caused by cognitive deficits. In one study 5-flouracil caused ocular toxicity in 25-38% of patients treated with the drug.<ref>Khaw P. T., Sherwood M. B., MacKay S. L., Rossi M. J. & Schultz G. 1992. "Five-minute treatments with ﬂuorouracil, ﬂoxuridine, and mitomycin have long-term effects on human Tenon’s capsule ﬁbroblasts." "Archives of Ophthalmology, 110: 1150-115.</ref> Methotextrate also caused ocular toxicity in 25% of patients within 2–7 days of initial chemotherapy regimen with the drug.<ref>Al-Tweigeri T, Nabholtz J. M., & Mackey J. R. 1996. "Ocular toxicity and cancer chemotherapy." "Cancer", 78: 1359-1373.</ref> This evidence suggests that some of the visual based cognitive deficits experienced by cancer survivors may be due to damage at the ocular level rather than cognitive processing, but most likely it is due to a synergistic effect on both systems.

==Treatment==
Hypothesized treatment options include the use of [[antioxidant]]s, [[cognitive behavior therapy]], [[erythropoietin]] and stimulant drugs such as [[methylphenidate]], though as the mechanism of PCCI is not well understood the potential treatment options are equally theoretical.<ref name = Nelson/>

[[Modafinil]], approved for [[narcolepsy]], has been used [[off-label]] in trials with people with symptoms of PCCI. Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that can improve alertness and concentration, and studies have shown it to be effective at least among women treated for breast cancer.<ref>[http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=133730&ran=181335 Doctors are finding it harder to deny "Chemobrain"] The Virginian-Pilot October 2, 2007</ref><ref>[http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsarticle.aspx?articleid=111136  Modafinil Relieves Cognitive Chemotherapy Side Effects]  Psychiatric News, Stephanie Whyche, August 3, 2007 Volume 42 Number 15, page 31</ref>

While estrogen hormone supplementation may reverse the symptoms of PCCI in women treated for breast cancer,<ref name="pmid16286908" /> this carries health risks, including possibly promoting the proliferation of estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells.

==Research==
Research on PCCI is limited, and studies on the subject have often been conflicting in results, in part due to differing means of assessing and defining the phenomenon, which makes comparison and synthesis difficult.<ref name="pmid17882646"/>  Most studies have involved small samples, making generalization difficult. There has been a focus on PCCI in younger cancer patients. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about PCCI in the [[Old age|elderly]].<ref name="pmid17882646"/>

Several recent studies have advanced the field using [[neuroimaging]] techniques. In 2005, Dr. Masatoshi Inagaki used [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) to measure differences in brain volume between breast cancer patients exposed to chemotherapy and subjects unexposed. Subjects were tested at two periods: one year after surgery, and again at three years post-surgery. Results from the first year study found smaller volumes of gray and white matter in patients exposed to chemotherapy. However, in the three-year study, both groups of breast cancer survivors were observed to have similar gray and white matter volumes. Altered brain structure in chemotherapy patients provides explanation for cognitive impairment.<ref>Inagaki, M., Yoshikawa, E., Matsuoka, Y., Sugawara, Y., et al. (2006). Smaller Regional Volumes of Brain Gray and White Matter Demonstrated in Breast Cancer Survivors Exposed to Adjuvant Chemotherapy. Cancer, 109 (1): 146-156.</ref>

Another study in 2007 investigated the differences in brain structure between two adult, monozygotic twin females. One underwent chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, while the other did not have cancer and was not treated with chemotherapy. MRI scans were taken of both twins' brain while taking part in a working memory task. Results found that twin A (exposed to chemotherapy) experienced a broader spatial extent of activation in her brain than twin B (not exposed to chemotherapy). Twin A also reported a greater difficulty than twin B in completing the memory activity. The authors of this study declare that commonly chemotherapy patients will self-report cognitive complaints, although they perform within normal limits on neuropsychological tasks. MRI scans may provide evidence for this occurrence. Chemotherapy patients may require greater volume of neural circuitry to complete neuropsychological tasks compared to others.<ref>Ferguson, R. J., McDonald, B. C., Saykin, A. J. & Ahles, T. A. (2007). Brain structure and function differences in monozygotic twins: possible effects of breast cancer chemotherapy. Journal of Clinical Oncology, 25: 3866-3870.</ref>

[[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) is also used to study post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment. In one study in 2007, scans were taken of patients exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy. Significantly altered blood flow in the brain was found, most notably in the frontal cortex and cerebellum. The most significant difference of blood flow was found in the inferior frontal gyrus. Authors report resting metabolism in this area is associated with performance on short term memory tasks.<ref>Silverman, D. H., Dy C. J., Castellon, S. A. (2007). Altered frontocortical cerebellar, and basal ganglia activity in adjuvant treated breast cancer survivors 5-10 years after chemotherapy. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 103 (3), 303-311.</ref>

==Prognosis==
While frustrating, the ultimate outcome is very good:  symptoms typically disappear in about four years.<ref name="pmid16286908" />

==History==
The symptoms of PCCI were recognized by researchers in the 1980s, who typically described it as mild cognitive impairment subsequent to successful cancer treatment.<ref name="pmid16286908" /> Some authors say that it was identified primarily in [[breast cancer]] survivor and [[support group]]s as affecting a subset of individuals treated with [[chemotherapy]], who attributed it to the effects of the medication taken to treat their cancers.<ref name="pmid17882646">{{cite journal |unused_data=1B69BA326FFE69C3F0A8F227DF8201D0 |author=Hurria A, Somlo G, Ahles T |title=Renaming "chemobrain" |journal=Cancer Invest. |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=373–7 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17882646 |doi=10.1080/07357900701506672 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/07357900701506672&magic=pubmed}}</ref>
