A '''nerve''' is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of [[axon]]s (the long, slender projections of [[neuron]]s) in the [[peripheral nervous system]]. A nerve provides a common pathway for the [[electrochemical]] [[nerve impulse]]s that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs.

In the [[central nervous system]], the analogous structures are known as [[Neural tract|tracts]].<ref name=Purves>{{cite book |author=Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzppatrick D ''et al.'' |title=Neuroscience |edition=4th |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=11–20 |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-87893-697-7 }}</ref><ref name=Marieb>{{cite book |author=Marieb EN, Hoehn K |title=Human Anatomy & Physiology |edition=7th |publisher=Pearson |pages=388–602 |year=2007 |isbn=0-8053-5909-5 }}</ref>  Neurons are sometimes called ''nerve cells'', though this term is potentially misleading since many neurons do not form nerves, and nerves also include non-neuronal [[Schwann cells]] that coat the axons in [[myelin]].

Each nerve is a cordlike structure that contains many axons. These axons are often referred to as "fibres". Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the [[endoneurium]]. The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the [[perineurium]]. Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the [[epineurium]].

== Anatomy ==
Nerves are categorized into three groups based on the direction that signals are conducted:
*''[[Afferent nerve]]s'' conduct signals from [[sensory neuron]]s to the [[central nervous system]], for example from the [[mechanoreceptors]] in [[skin]].
*''[[Efferent nerve]]s'' conduct signals from the central nervous system along [[motor neuron]]s to their target [[muscle]]s and [[gland]]s.
*''Mixed nerves'' contain both afferent and efferent axons, and thus conduct both incoming [[sense|sensory]] information and outgoing muscle commands in the same bundle.
Nerves can be categorized into two groups based on where they connect to the central nervous system:
*''[[Spinal nerve]]s'' innervate much of the body, and connect through the [[spinal column]] to the [[spinal cord]]. They are given letter-number designations according to the [[vertebra]] through which they connect to the spinal column.
*''[[Cranial nerves]]'' innervate parts of the head, and connect directly to the [[brain]] (especially to the [[brainstem]]). They are typically assigned [[Roman numerals]] from 1 to 12, although [[cranial nerve zero]] is sometimes included. In addition, cranial nerves have descriptive names.
[[File:Gray636.png|thumb|Cross-section of a nerve]]
Each nerve is covered externally by a dense sheath of [[connective tissue]], the [[epineurium]]. Underlying this is a layer of flat cells, the [[perineurium]], which forms a complete sleeve around a bundle of axons. Perineurial septae extend into the nerve and subdivide it into several bundles of fibres. Surrounding each such fibre is the [[endoneurium]]. This forms an unbroken tube which extends from the surface of the spinal cord to the level at which the axon synapses with its muscle fibres, or ends in [[sensory receptor]]s. The endoneurium consists of an inner sleeve of material called the [[glycocalyx]] and an outer, delicate, meshwork of [[collagen]] fibres. Nerves are bundled along with [[blood vessels]], since the neurons of a nerve have fairly high energy requirements. 
Within the endoneurium, the individual nerve fibres are surrounded by a low protein liquid called endoneurial fluid. The endoneurium has properties analogous to the [[blood–brain barrier]], in that it prevents certain molecules from crossing from the blood into the endoneurial fluid. In this respect, endoneurial fluid is similar to [[cerebro-spinal fluid]] in the [[central nervous system]]. During the development of nerve [[edema]] from nerve irritation or (injury), the amount of endoneurial fluid may increase at the site of irritation. This increase in fluid can be visualized using [[magnetic resonance neurography]], and thus MR neurography can identify nerve irritation and/or injury.

==Physiology==
A nerve conveys information in the form of electrochemical impulses (known as [[nerve impulse]]s or [[action potential]]s) carried by the individual neurons that make up the nerve. These impulses are extremely fast, with some [[myelinated]] neurons conducting at speeds up to 120&nbsp;m/s. The impulses travel from one neuron to another by crossing a [[synapse]], the message is converted from [[Electrical synapse|electrical]] to [[Chemical synapse|chemical]] and then back to electrical.<ref name="Purves" >{{cite book | author = Purves, Dale, George J.

Nerves can be categorized into two groups based on function:
*''[[Sensory nerves]]'' conduct sensory information from their receptors to the central nervous system, where the information is then processed. Thus they are synonymous with ''afferent nerves''.
*''[[Motor nerves]]'' conduct signals from the central nervous system to muscles. Thus they are synonymous with ''efferent nerves''.<ref name="Purves" /><ref name="Marieb" />

== Clinical importance ==

Damage to nerves can be caused by physical injury or swelling (e.g. [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]), autoimmune diseases (e.g. [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]]), infection ([[neuritis]]), [[diabetes]] or failure of the blood vessels surrounding the nerve. A ''pinched nerve'' occurs when pressure is placed on a nerve, usually from swelling due to an injury or pregnancy. Nerve damage or pinched nerves are usually accompanied by [[pain]], numbness, weakness, or [[paralysis]].  Patients may feel these symptoms in areas far from the actual site of damage, a phenomenon called [[referred pain]]. Referred pain occurs because when a nerve is damaged, signalling is altered for all parts of the area from which the nerve receives input, not just the site of the damage. 
[[Neurology|Neurologists]] usually diagnose disorders of the nerves by a [[physical examination]], including the testing of [[reflex]]es, [[walking]] and other directed movements, [[muscle]] weakness, [[proprioception]], and the sense of [[Somatosensory system|touch]]. This initial exam can be followed with tests such as [[nerve conduction study]] and [[electromyography]] (EMG).

===Cancer===
Cancer can spread along nerves; this is known as ''[[perineural spread]]'' and often is associated with a worse prognosis.

===Multiple sclerosis===
[[Multiple sclerosis]] is a disease associated with extensive nerve damage. It occurs when the [[macrophage]]s of an individual's own immune system damage the myelin sheaths that insulate the axon of the nerve.

== Growth and stimulation ==
Nerve growth normally ends in adolescence, but can be re-stimulated with a molecular mechanism known as "[[Notch signaling]]."<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/10/991022005127.htm Yale Study Shows Way To Re-Stimulate Brain Cell Growth ScienceDaily] (Oct. 22, 1999) — Results Could Boost Understanding Of Alzheimer's, Other Brain Disorders</ref>
