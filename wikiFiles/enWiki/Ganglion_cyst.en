A '''ganglion cyst''', also known as a '''Bible cyst''' or '''Bible bump''', is a swelling that often appears on or around [[joint]]s and [[tendon]]s in the [[hand]]  or [[foot]].  

==Etymology==
An apparent misnomer,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FbSlyyshjOoC&pg=PA24|title=The Dictionary of Modern Medicine|author=J.C. Segen|year=1992}} (see the entry for aneurysmal bone cyst, which "like pyogenic granuloma and ganglion cyst, a misnomer that has withstood the sands of time and the dint of logic")</ref> the ganglion cyst is unrelated to the neural "[[ganglion]]" or "[[ganglion]] cell"; [[wikt:ganglion|its etymology]] traces back to the ancient Greek ''γάγγλιον'', a "knot" or "swelling beneath the skin",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myetymology.com/greek/ganglion.html|title=Etymology of the Greek word ganglion (γάγγλιον)}}</ref> which extends to the neural masses by analogy.  [[Hippocrates]] is generally credited with their description.<ref name=Camasta /><ref>See Hippocrates' "On the Articulations" (part 40) [[s:On the Articulations#Part XL|at Wikisource]]</ref>

The term "Bible cyst" (or "Bible bump") is derived from a common treatment in the past that consisted of hitting the cyst with a [[Bible]] or similarly large book.<ref name="eatonhand.com">http://www.eatonhand.com/hw/hw013.htm</ref> Striking the ganglion cyst with a large tome is usually sufficient to rupture the cyst, and re-accumulation is uncommon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins Basic Pathology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1|pages=825|url=http://www.studentconsult.com}}</ref>

==Cause==
[[File:Kyste420.jpg|thumb|kyste biblique]]
The most commonly accepted cause of ganglion cysts is the "[[herniation]] hypothesis", in which they occur as "an out-pouching or distention of a weakened portion of a joint capsule or tendon sheath."  This is based on the observations that the cysts occur close to tendons and joints, the microscopic anatomy of the cyst resembles that of the tenosynovial tissue, the fluid is similar in composition to [[synovial fluid]], and dye injected into the joint capsule frequently ends up in the cyst, which can become enlarged after activity.  However, dye injected into the cyst rarely enters the joint, which has been attributed to the formation of an effective "[[check valve]]" allowing fluid out of the joint, but not back in.<ref name=Camasta /> [[Synovial cyst]]s, posttraumatic degeneration of [[connective tissue]] and [[inflammation]] have been considered as the causes. Other possible mechanisms for the development of ganglion cysts include repeated mechanical stress, [[Zygapophysial joint|facet]] [[arthrosis]], myxoid degeneration of periarticular [[fibrous tissue]]s and liquefaction with chronic damage, increased production of [[hyaluronic acid]] by [[fibroblasts]], and a proliferation of [[mesenchymal cell]]s. Ganglion cyst can develop independently from a joint.<ref name=Kim>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098430/|title=A Ganglion Cyst in the Second Lumbar Intervertebral Foramen|author=Sang Woo Kim et al.|journal=J Korean Neurosurg Soc.|date=2011-04|volume=49|issue=4|pages=237–240|doi=10.3340/jkns.2011.49.4.237}} (original source cites eight additional references for the quoted paragraph)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ribes|first=Ramón|title=Learning Musculoskeletal Imaging|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540880004|pages=197}}</ref>

==Histopathology==
[[File:Ganglion Cyst, Hand.jpg|thumb|Ganglion cyst of the hand with multiple cystic chambers containing glairy material. The walls are composed of bland fibrous tissue with no specialized lining.]]
They are thin-walled cysts containing clear, [[Mucus|mucinous]] fluid.<ref name=pg />

==Clinical features==
The average size of these cysts is 2.0&nbsp;cm, but cysts of more than 5&nbsp;cm have been excised.<ref name=Camasta>{{cite web|url=http://www.podiatryinstitute.com/pdfs/Update_1993/1993_33.pdf|title=excision of the ganglion cyst|author=Craig A. Camasta, DPM|year=1993|publisher=Podiatry Institute}}</ref> The size of the cyst may vary over time, and can increase after activity.

===Sites===
It is most frequently located around the [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsum]] of the [[wrist]] and on the [[finger]]s. A common site of occurrence is along the [[extensor carpi radialis brevis]] as it passes over the dorsum of the wrist joint. Although most commonly found in the wrist, ganglion cysts may also occur in the foot.<ref name=pg>{{cite book|last=McNabb|first=J. W.|title=Practical Guide to Joint and Soft Tissue Injection and Aspiration|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781753630|pages=62-65}}</ref> 

Ganglion cysts are "commonly observed in association with the joints and tendons of the appendicular skeleton, with 88% "in communication with the multiple small joints of the hand and wrist" and 11% with those of the foot and ankle.<ref name=Camasta />  They are most often found around the wrist joint, especially at the [[scapholunate ligament|scapho-lunate area]], which accounts for 80% of all ganglion cysts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In a 2007 study of patients whose foot lumps were being surgically removed in [[Glasgow]], 39 of 101 cases were ganglion cysts.  The study replicated an earlier result that no ganglion cysts were found on the sole or heel of the foot; the authors wrote that "Although lumps in these areas may be ganglia, the surgeon should probably consider other diagnoses in the first instance."  They also noted a marked female preponderance (85%) and that 11 of the other cases had been misdiagnosed as ganglion cysts before surgery.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1964714/|title=The Differential Diagnosis of Foot Lumps: 101 Cases Treated Surgically in North Glasgow Over 4 Years|author=Duncan JM Macdonald et al.|journal=Ann R Coll Surg Engl.|date=2007-08|volume=89|issue=3|pages=272–275}}</ref>

Ganglion cysts can also occur about the knee, commonly near the [[cruciate ligaments]], also at the origins of the [[gastrocnemius]] tendon and anteriorly in [[infrapatellar fat pad|Hoffa's infrapatellar fat pad]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cFm_qnPAvV8C&pg=PA259|title=Fundamentals of Musculoskeletal Ultrasound|author=Jon Arthur Jacobson|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2007}}</ref>

From their common origin at the joint or tendon, ganglion cysts can stray into a wide range of locations. Rarely, [[intraosseous]] ganglion cysts occur, sometimes in combination with a cyst in the overlying soft tissue.<ref name=Camasta /><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222705/|title=Intraosseous ganglion cyst of the humeral head in a competitive flat water paddler: case report|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc.|date=2011-12|volume=55|number=4|pages=294–301}} (includes MRI images)</ref> Very rare cases of intramuscular ganglion cysts in the [[gastrocnemius muscle]] have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://210.101.116.107/kda/JournalSearch_index.asp?year=2010&page=56&vol=48&iss=1|title=Case Report : Intramuscular Ganglion Cyst of the Gastrocnemius Muscle|author=Jae Jeong Park et al.|year=2010|journal=Korean Journal of Dermatology}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcu.20609/abstract|title=Ruptured intramuscular ganglion cyst in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle: Sonographic appearance|author=Soonchan Park MD et al.|journal=Journal of Clinical Ultrasound|volume=37|issue=8|pages=478–481|date=2009-10}}</ref>  It is possible for the cyst to be displaced considerably from its connection to the joint.  In one extreme case a ganglion cyst was observed to propagate extensively via the conduit of the [[common peroneal nerve]] sheath to a location in the thigh; in such cases surgery to the proximal joint to remove the articular connection can remove the need for a riskier, more extensive surgery in the neural tissue of the thigh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishneurosurgery.org.tr/pdf/pdf_JTN_1039.pdf|title=Re: Pure Peroneal Intraneural Ganglion Cyst: Hindsight is 20/20|author=Robert J. Spinner et al.|publisher=Turkish Neurosurgery|year=2012|volume=22|number=4|pages=527–528}}</ref>  The cysts can even intrude into the spine, which can cause pain and dysesthesia in distant extremities.<ref name=Kim />

It has recently been proposed that cystic adventitial disease, in which a cyst occurs within the [[popliteal artery]] near the knee, may occur by an articular mechanism, with a conduit leading from the joint, similar to the development of ganglion cysts that spread within the peroneal nerve.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22933403|title=Evidence to support that adventitial cysts, analogous to intraneural ganglion cysts, are also joint-connected.|author=R. J. Spinner ''et al.''|journal=Clin Anat.|date=2012-08-29|doi=10.1002/ca.22152}}</ref>

Cysts have also been reported to occur nearby to shoulder joint, compressing one or more nerves and causing bone erosions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Larry D.|title=MasterCases: Shoulder and Elbow Surgery|year=2003|publisher=Thieme|isbn=9780865778733|pages=241}}</ref> 

==Diagnosis==
Ganglion cysts are easily diagnosed, as they are visible and pliable to touch. 

Radiographs in [[Anteroposterior|AP]] and lateral views are obtained to exclude any more serious underlying pathology.<ref name=md>{{cite book|title=Pocket Guide to Musculoskeletal Diagnosis|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781597450096|pages=63}}</ref> Ultrasound may be done to detect the presence of [[occult]] cysts.<ref name=gale />

==Treatment==
Surgical treatments remain the primary option, other than doing nothing at all, for the treatment of ganglion cysts. [[Arthroscopic]] surgery of the wrist is becoming available as an alternative to open excision of ganglion cysts. Alternatively, a [[hypodermic needle]] may be used to drain the fluid from the cyst (aspiration) and a corticosteroid is injected after cyst is empty.<ref name=gale>{{cite book|title=The Gale encyclopedia of surgery: a guide for patients and caregivers, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Gale|isbn=9780787677213|pages=560}}</ref> However, if the fluid has become thick owing to the passage of time, this treatment is not always effective. 

An outdated method of treating a ganglion cyst was to strike the lump with a large heavy book, causing the cyst to rupture and drain into the surrounding tissues. Since almost every home owned a Bible and it was often the largest book in the home, this is what was commonly used, which led to the nickname of "Bible bumps" or "[[Gideon Bible|Gideon]]'s disease."<ref name="eatonhand.com"/>

==Complications==
Complications of treatment include stiffness in hand and scar formation.<ref name=gale />

==Prognosis==
Recurrence rate is higher in aspirated cysts than in excised ones.<ref name=md /> Excised ganglion cyst may recur in 5-15% cases, usually because the cyst was not completely removed.<ref name=gale />

Ganglion cysts have been found to recur following surgery in 12% <ref>{{cite journal |author=Gallego S, Mathoulin C. |title=Arthroscopic resection of dorsal wrist ganglia: 114 cases with minimum follow-up of 2 years |journal=Arthroscopy |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=1675–1682 |year=2010 |month=|pmid=20952152 |pmc= |doi= |url=}}</ref> to 41% <ref>{{cite journal |author=Lidder S, Ranawat V, Ahrens P. |title=Surgical excision of wrist ganglia; literature review and nine-year retrospective study of recurrence and patient satisfaction |journal=Orthop Rev |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=e5 |year=2009 |month=|pmid=21808669 |pmc= |doi= |url=}}</ref> of patients.

A six-year outcome study of treatment of ganglia on the back (dorsum) of the wrist compared excision, aspiration and no treatment. Neither excision nor aspiration provided long-term benefit over no treatment. Of the untreated ganglia, 58% resolved spontaneously; the post-surgery recurrence rate in this study was 39%.<ref>Dias JJ, Dhukaram V, Kumar P, The natural history of untreated dorsal wrist ganglia and patient reported outcome 6 years after intervention. J Hand Surg Eur Vol. 2007 Oct;32(5):502-8.</ref>

A similar study in 2003 of palmar wrist ganglion states: "At 2 and 5 year follow-up, regardless of treatment, no difference in symptoms was found, regardless of whether the palmar wrist ganglion was excised, aspirated or left alone." <ref>Dias J, Buch K. Palmar wrist ganglion: does intervention improve outcome? A prospective study of the natural history and patient-reported treatment outcomes. J Hand Surg Br. 2003 Apr;28(2):172-6.</ref>
