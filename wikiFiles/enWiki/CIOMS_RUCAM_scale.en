The '''CIOMS/RUCAM scale''' is a tool to predict whether [[liver]] damage can be attributed to a particular [[medication]].

==Hepatotoxicity==
Determining [[hepatotoxicity]] (toxic effects of a substance on the liver) remains a major challenge in clinical practice due to lack of reliable markers.<ref name="pmid17230599">{{cite journal |author=Andrade RJ, Robles M, Fernández-Castañer A, López-Ortega S, López-Vega MC, Lucena MI |title=Assessment of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in clinical practice: a challenge for gastroenterologists |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=329–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17230599 |url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/13/329.asp|doi=}}</ref> Many other conditions lead to similar clinical as well as pathological picture. To diagnose hepatotoxicity, a causal relationship between the use of the toxin or drug and subsequent liver damage has to be established, but might be difficult, especially when idiosyncratic reaction is suspected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arundel C, Lewis JH |title=Drug-induced liver disease in 2006 |journal=Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=244–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17414839 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e3280b17dfb}}</ref> Simultaneous use of multiple drugs may add to the complexity. As in [[acetaminophen]] toxicity, well established dose dependent pharmacological hepatotoxicity is easier to spot.

==Interpretation==
The [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences|CIOMS]]/RUCAM scale has been proposed to establish causal relationship between offending drug and liver damage. The CIOMS/RUCAM scale involves a scoring system which categorizes the suspicion into "definite or highly probable" (score > 8), "probable" (score 6-8), "possible" (score 3-5), "unlikely" (score 1-2) and "excluded" (score ≤ 0). In clinical practice physicians put more emphasis on the presence or absence of similarity between the biochemical profile of the patient and known biochemical profile of the suspected toxicity ( e.g. cholestatic damage in [[Co-amoxiclav|amoxycillin-clauvonic acid]] ).<ref name="pmid17230599"/>

* ''Response to re-administration:''
**Positive:  +3
**Compatible:  +1
**Negative:  -2
**Not available or not interpretable:  +0
**or plasma concentration of drug known as toxic:  +3
**or validated laboratory test with high specificity, sensitivity, and predictive values:  
***Positive:  +3
***Negative:  -3
***Not interpretable or not available:  +0

==Score analysis==
Points are summed and the total compared to this chart:

* 0 or lower:  relationship with the drug excluded
* 1-2:  unlikely
* 3-5:  possible
* 6-8:  probable
* >8:  highly probable

If the results are incompatible with a connection, then the case is considered "unrelated".
In some cases, insufficient information is available; these cases are recorded as "insufficiently documented".
