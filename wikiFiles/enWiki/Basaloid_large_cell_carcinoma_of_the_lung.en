'''Basaloid large cell carcinoma of the lung''', also known as "basaloid large cell lung cancer" (Bas-LCLC), is a rare [[histology|histological]] variant of [[lung cancer]] featuring certain distinctive [[cytological]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] architectural, and [[immunohistochemical]] characteristics and clinical behavior.<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

==History==
Basaloid forms of lung [[carcinoma]] were first described in the [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] medical literature by Dr. Elisabeth Brambilla and her colleagues in 1992.<ref name="pmid1381335">{{cite journal |author=Brambilla E, Moro D, Veale D, ''et al.'' |title=Basal cell (basaloid) carcinoma of the lung: a new morphologic and phenotypic entity with separate prognostic significance |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=993–1003 |year=1992 |month=September |pmid=1381335 |doi= 10.1016/0046-8177(92)90260-A|url=}}</ref> They were first recognized as distinct clinicopathological variants of both squamous cell and large cell lung cancers in 1999, within the third revision of the [[World Health Organization]] lung tumor typing and classification scheme. <ref name='WHO1999'/>

==Classification==
Lung cancer is a large and exceptionally [[heterogeneous]] family of malignancies.<ref name='RoggliVollmer'>{{cite journal |author=Roggli VL, Vollmer RT, Greenberg SD, McGavran MH, Spjut HJ, Yesner R |title=Lung cancer heterogeneity: a blinded and randomized study of 100 consecutive cases |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=569–79 |year=1985 |month=June |pmid=2987102 |doi=10.1016/S0046-8177(85)80106-4}}</ref> Over 50 different [[histological]] variants are explicitly recognized within the 2004 revision of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) typing system ("WHO-2004"), currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme.<ref name='who2004' /> 

Many recognized lung cancer variants are rare, recently described, and poorly understood.<ref name='WHO1999'>{{cite journal |author=Brambilla E, Travis WD, Colby TV, Corrin B, Shimosato Y |title=The new World Health Organization classification of lung tumours |journal=Eur.

==Epidemiology==
Basaloid carcinomas of the lung (like nearly all other recognized subtypes of lung cancer) are highly associated with [[tobacco smoking]].<ref name="pmid18094005">{{cite journal |author=Moro-Sibilot D, Lantuejoul S, Diab S, ''et al.'' |title=Lung carcinomas with a basaloid pattern: a study of 90 cases focusing on their poor prognosis |journal=Eur.

==Diagnosis==
Like other forms of [[lung cancer]], Bas-SqCC is ultimately diagnosed after a [[pathologist]] examines a [[tumor]] sample containing viable [[malignant]] cells and tissue under a light [[microscope]] and identifies certain particular characteristics.
==Staging==
[[Staging]] of Bas-LCLC patients is usually performed in an analogous fashion to patients with other [[non-small cell lung carcinoma]].<ref name='TravisIASLC'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD |title=Reporting lung cancer pathology specimens. Impact of the anticipated 7th Edition TNM classification based on recommendations of the IASLC Staging Committee |journal=Histopathology |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=3–11 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19187176 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2559.2008.03179.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0309-0167&date=2009&volume=54&issue=1&spage=3}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Because of its rarity, there have been no clinical trials conducted on pure Bas-LCLC.<ref name='trials'>http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search</ref>

Generally, variants of the 4 major lung cancer subtypes (squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma) are treated according to protocols designed for the major subtype.<ref name='trials'>http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search</ref>

==Prognosis==
Bas-LCLC are considered to have a particularly poor prognosis, even compared to other forms of lung cancer.<ref name="pmid18094005">{{cite journal |author=Moro-Sibilot D, Lantuejoul S, Diab S, ''et al.'' |title=Lung carcinomas with a basaloid pattern: a study of 90 cases focusing on their poor prognosis |journal=Eur.
