'''Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis''' (PFIC) refers to a group of [[familial]] [[cholestasis|cholestatic]] conditions caused by defects in [[bile|biliary]] epithelial transporters.  The clinical presentation usually occurs first in [[childhood]] with progressive [[cholestasis]].  This usually leads to [[failure to thrive]], [[cirrhosis|hepatic failure]], and the need for [[liver transplant]]ation.

==Pathogenesis==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is inherited in an [[Recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] pattern.]]
'''PFIC-1''' is caused by a variety of [[mutations]] in [[ATP8B1]], a [[gene]] coding for a P-type [[ATPase]] [[protein]], FIC-1, that is responsible for [[phospholipid]] [[translocation]]{{dn|date=April 2012}}.<ref name="pmid9500542">{{cite journal |author=Bull LN, van Eijk MJ, Pawlikowska L, ''et al.'' |title=A gene encoding a P-type ATPase mutated in two forms of hereditary cholestasis |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=219–24 |year=1998 |pmid=9500542 |doi=10.1038/ng0398-219}}</ref>  It was previously identified as clinical entities known as '''Byler's disease''' and '''Greenland-Eskimo familial cholestasis'''.  Patients with PFIC-1 may also have watery [[diarrhea]], in addition to the clinical features below, due to FIC-1's expression in the [[intestine]].  How ATP8B1 mutation leads to cholestasis is not yet well understood.

'''PFIC-2''' is caused by a variety of [[mutations]] in [[ABCB11]], the [[gene]] that codes for the ''bile salt export pump'', or BSEP.  Retention of bile salts within hepatocytes, which are the only cell type to express BSEP, causes hepatocellular damage and cholestasis.  

'''PFIC-3''' is caused by a variety of [[mutations]] in [[ABCB4]], the gene encoding multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3),<ref name="pmid11313315">{{cite journal |author=Jacquemin E, De Vree JM, Cresteil D, ''et al.'' |title=The wide spectrum of multidrug resistance 3 deficiency: from neonatal cholestasis to cirrhosis of adulthood |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=1448–58 |year=2001 |pmid=11313315 |doi=10.1053/gast.2001.23984}}</ref> which codes for a [[flippase]] responsible for [[phosphatidylcholine]] translocation.  The defective phosphatidylcholine translocation leads to a lack of phosphatidylcholine in bile.  Phosphatidylcholine normally chaperones bile acids, preventing damage to the biliary epithelium.  The free or "unchaperoned" bile acids in bile of patients with MDR3 deficiency cause a [[cholangitis]].  Biochemically, this is of note, as PFIC-3 is associated with a markedly elevated GGT.  

The [[inheritance]] pattern of all three forms of PFIC defined to date is [[autosomal recessive]].

==Clinical presentation and natural history==
The onset of the [[disease]] is usually before age 2, but patients have been diagnosed with PFIC even into [[adolescence]].  Of the three entities, PFIC-3 usually presents earliest.  Patients usually present in early childhood with [[cholestasis]], [[jaundice]], and [[failure to thrive]].  Intense [[pruritus]] is characteristic;<ref name="pmid15598335">{{cite journal |author=Shneider BL |title=Progressive intrahepatic cholestasis: mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy |journal=Pediatric transplantation |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=609–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15598335 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-3046.2004.00240.x}}</ref> in patients who present in adolescence, it has been linked with [[suicide]].  Patients may have [[fat]] [[malabsorption]], leading to fat soluble [[vitamin]] deficiency, and complications, including [[osteopenia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2771.htm |title=eMedicine - Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis : Article by Karan M Emerick, MD |accessdate=2007-07-21 |work=}}</ref>

Biochemical markers include a normal [[liver function tests|GGT]] for PFIC-1 and -2, with a markedly elevated GGT for PFIC-3.  Serum [[bile acid]] levels are grossly elevated.  Serum [[cholesterol]] levels are typically not elevated, as is seen usually in cholestasis, as the [[pathology]] is due to a transporter as opposed to an anatomical problem with biliary cells.

The disease is typically progressive, leading to fulminant [[liver]] failure and [[death]] in childhood, in the absence of [[liver transplantation]].  [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]] may develop in PFIC-2 at a very early age; even toddlers have been affected.

==Pathology==
[[Liver biopsy|Liver biopsies]] typically show evidence of [[cholestasis]] (including bile plugs and bile infarcts), duct hypoplasia, hepatocellular injury, and Zone 3 [[fibrosis]].  Giant cell change and other features of hepatocellular injury are more pronounced in PFIC-2 than in PFIC-1 or PFIC-3.  End-stage disease in all forms of PFIC defined to date is characterized by bridging fibrosis with duct proliferation in peri-portal regions.<ref name="pmid8014759">{{cite journal |author=Alonso EM, Snover DC, Montag A, Freese DK, Whitington PF |title=Histologic pathology of the liver in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis |journal=J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=128–33 |year=1994 |pmid=8014759 |doi=10.1097/00005176-199402000-00002}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Initial treatment is supportive, with the use of agents to treat [[cholestasis]] and [[pruritus]], including the following:
* [[Ursodeoxycholic acid]]
* [[Cholestyramine]]
* [[Rifampin]]
* [[Naloxone]], in refractory cases

Patients should be supplemented with fat soluble vitamins, and occasionally [[medium-chain triglycerides]] in order to improve growth.

When liver synthetic dysfunction is significant, patients should be listed for [[liver transplant|transplantation]].  Family members should be tested for PFIC mutations, in order to determine risk of transmission.

==Associations==
* [[Consanguinity]] is believed to be a major risk factor.
* Similar transport protein mutations are believed to pose a higher risk for [[intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy]].
