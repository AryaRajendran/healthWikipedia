The '''inferior vena cava''' (or IVC), also known as the '''posterior vena cava''',<ref>Organisms and Populations 3rd Ed.</ref> is the large [[vein]] that carries de-oxygenated [[blood]] from the lower half of the body into the [[right atrium]] of the [[heart]]. 

It is [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] to the abdominal cavity and runs alongside of the [[vertebral column]] on its right side (i.e. it is a [[retroperitoneal]] structure). It enters the [[right atrium]] at the lower right, back side of the heart.

==Drainage patterns==
The IVC is formed by the joining of the left and right [[common iliac vein]]s and brings blood into the [[right atrium]] of the heart. It also [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]] with the [[azygos vein]] system (which runs on the right side of the vertebral column) and  venous [[plexus]]es next to the [[spinal cord]]. 

The [[caval opening]] is at T8. The specific levels of the tributaries are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Vein''' || '''Level''' 
 |- 
 | [[hepatic veins]] || T8
 |- 
 | [[inferior phrenic vein]] || T8
 |- 
 | right [[suprarenal vein]] || L1
 |- 
 | [[renal veins]] || L1
 |- 
 | right [[gonadal vein]]|| L2
 |- 
 | [[lumbar veins]] || L1-L5
 |- 
 | [[common iliac veins]] || L5
|}

Because the IVC is not centrally located, there are some asymmetries in drainage patterns. The [[gonadal vein]]s and [[suprarenal vein]]s drain into the IVC on the right side, but into the [[renal vein]] on the left side, which in turn drains into the IVC. By contrast, all the [[lumbar veins]] and [[hepatic veins]] usually drain directly into the IVC.

The tributaries of Inferior vena cava can be remembered using the [[mnemonic]], "'''I''' '''L'''ike '''T'''o '''R'''ise '''S'''o '''H'''igh", for '''I'''lliac vein (common), '''L'''umbar vein, '''T'''esticular vein, '''R'''enal vein, '''S'''uprarenal vein and '''H'''epatic vein.<ref name="LHC">{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/902/Inferior_vena_cava_tributaries | title = Medical mnemonic for IVC tributaries | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}</ref>

Note that the vein that carries de-oxygenated blood from the upper half of the body is the [[superior vena cava]].

==Pathologies associated with the IVC==
Health problems attributed to the IVC are most often associated with it being compressed (ruptures are rare because it has a low intraluminal [[pressure]]). Typical sources of external pressure are an enlarged [[aorta]] ([[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]), the [[pregnant|gravid]] [[uterus]] ([[aortocaval compression syndrome]]) and abdominal maligancies, such as [[colorectal cancer]], [[renal cell carcinoma]] and [[ovarian cancer]].  Since the inferior vena cava is primarily a right-sided structure, unconscious pregnant females should be turned on to their left side (the [[recovery position]]), to relieve pressure on it and facilitate venous return.  In rare cases, straining associated with [[defecation]] can lead to restricted blood flow through the IVC and result in [[fainting|syncope]] (fainting).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brophy | first1 = CM | last2 = Evans | first2 = L | last3 = Sumpio | first3 = BE | title = Defecation syncope secondary to functional inferior vena caval obstruction during a Valsalva maneuver | journal = Annals of vascular surgery | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 374–7 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8268080 | doi = 10.1007/BF02002893 }}</ref>

Occlusion of the IVC is rare, but considered life-threatening and is an emergency.  It is associated with [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[IVC filter]]s, [[liver transplantation]] and instrumentation (e.g. [[catheter]] in the [[femoral vein]]).<ref>Geehan DM, Inferior Vena Caval Thrombosis, emedicine.com, URL: http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2718.htm, Accessed: August 3, 2005.</ref>

Trauma to the vena cava is a potentially life-threatening situation as exsanguination may occur rapidly.

==Embryology==
In the [[embryo]], the IVC and right atrium are separated by the [[Eustachian valve]], also known in [[Latin]] as the ''valvula venae cavae inferioris'' (valve of the inferior vena cava).  In the adult, this structure typically has totally regressed or remains as a small endocardial fold.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Turhan Yavuz | last2 = Nazli | first2 = C | last3 = Kinay | first3 = O | last4 = Kutsal | first4 = A | title = Giant Eustachian Valve: with Echocardiographic Appearance of Divided Right Atrium | journal = Texas Heart Institute Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 336–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12484622 | pmc = 140300 }}</ref>
