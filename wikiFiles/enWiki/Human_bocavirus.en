'''Human bocavirus (HBoV)''' is a [[parvovirus]] that has been suggested to cause human disease. It is a probable cause of [[lower respiratory tract infection]]s and it has been linked to [[gastroenteritis]], although the role of this [[emerging infectious disease]] in human disease has not been firmly established.

== History ==

Allander and colleagues at the [[Karolinska Institutet]] in Stockholm, Sweden, first cloned this new member of the family of ''[[Parvoviridae]]'' in 2005 from pooled [[nasopharyngeal aspirate]]s (NPA, collection of aspirated fluid from the back of the nasal cavity).<ref name="pmid16118271">{{cite journal |author=Allander T, Tammi MT, Eriksson M, Bjerkner A, Tiveljung-Lindell A, Andersson B |title=Cloning of a human parvovirus by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples |journal=Proc.

The name bocavirus is derived from '''bo'''vine and '''ca'''nine, referring to the two known hosts for other members of this genus; the [[bovine parvovirus]] which infects cattle, and the [[minute virus of canines]] which infects dogs.<ref name="pmid12441065">{{cite journal |author=Schwartz D, Green B, Carmichael LE, Parrish CR |title=The canine minute virus (minute virus of canines) is a distinct parvovirus that is most similar to bovine parvovirus |journal=Virology |volume=302 |issue=2 |pages=219–23 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12441065 |doi= 10.1006/viro.2002.1674|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0042682202916740}}</ref> Parvoviruses (Latin: small viruses) have a 5 [[kilobase]] long single-stranded [[DNA]], and they use some of their host's [[Cell cycle|replication]] proteins to copy their DNA.

The [[wikt:viron|viron]]s are small (diameter 18-26 [[nanometer]]s), icosahedral and non enveloped. The capsid has a T = 1 symmetry and consists of 60 copies of coat [[protein]]. The coat proteins have a conserved, eight stranded beta barrel motif that forms the core of the capsid. There is also a conserved alpha helix.<ref name=Gurda2010>Gurda BL, Parent KN, Bladek H, Sinkovits RS, DiMattia MA, Rence C, Castro A, McKenna R, Olson N, Brown K, Baker TS, Agbandje-McKenna M (2010) Human bocavirus capsid structure: insights into the structural repertoire of the parvoviridae. J Virol 84(12):5880-5889</ref>

The HBoV capsid shares three characteristic features also found in the other vertebrate parvoviruses:<ref name="Gurda2010"/> (1) a dimple like depression at each icosahedral 2-fold axis; (2) a large trimeric protrusion surrounds each 3-fold axis or is located at the 3-fold axis; (3) a channel at each 5-fold axis whose outermost opening is formed by a small pentameric structure encircled by a wide canyon like region. While this dimple is also found among the invertebrate parvoviruses they lack the 3-fold protrusions and canyon around the 5-fold channel. The external diameter of the capsid ranges from ∼21.5 [[nanometer]]s (nm) at the lowest points of the dimple and canyon to ∼28&nbsp;nm at the top of the protrusion.

The [[genome]] is a linear, single-stranded DNA 5.2-5.3 kilobases in length with terminal hairpin structures at both ends.

The genome encodes 3 open reading frames (ORF1, 2 and 3). The two left most ORFs encode 2 non structural proteins (NS1 and NP1). The right hand ORF (ORF3) encodes the capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2). The NP1 gene is in an alternate reading frame to VP1 and overlaps the start of VP1 by 13 nucleotides. Similarly, VP2 is collinear to VP1 and results from initiation of translation at a downstream ATG and co-terminates.

NP1 is a highly phosphorylated non-structural protein that induces apoptosis in infected cells.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sun B., Cai Y., Li Y., Li J., Liu K., Li Y., Yanga Y.|year=2013|title=The nonstructural protein NP1 of human bocavirus 1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in Hela cells|journal=Virology|volume=440|issue=1| pages=75-83|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682213000998}}</ref>

There is a single [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] located within the 3' hairpin. This is responsible for, by alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, for the generation of several (at least 6) [[messenger RNA|mRNA]]s.<ref name=Qiu2007>Qiu J, Cheng F, Johnson FB, Pintel D (2007) The transcription profile of the bocavirus bovine parvovirus is unlike those of previously characterized parvoviruses.J Virol 81(21):12080-12085</ref> The poly A tail is ~150 nucleotides in length.

After nuclear import the single stranded genome is converted to double stranded DNA and production of the viral NS1 protein commences.

The genome is replicated through a unique rolling hairpin mechanism that is dependent on the NS1 protein.<ref name=Tattersall1976>Tattersall P, Ward DC (1976) Rolling hairpin model for replication of parvovirus and linear chromosomal DNA. Nature 263(5573):106-109</ref> Replication results in the creation of a series of circular head to tail sequences.<ref name=Zhao2012>Zhao H, Zhao L, Sun Y, Qian Y, Liu L, Jia L, Zhang Y, Dong H (2012) Detection of a bocavirus circular genome in fecal specimens from children with acute diarrhea in Beijing, China. PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48980. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048980</ref>

A sequence conserved among the Parvoviridae TAAAAAT is found close to the 3' terminus.

Other parvoviruses replicate only when the host cell is in S phase: viral replication results in the death of the host cell. This pattern has not yet been experimentally confirmed for the bocaviruses but seems likely to be the case. Expression of the viral proteins alone does not cause host cell death.<ref>Chen AY, Cheng F, Lou S, Luo Y, Liu Z, Delwart E, Pintel D, Qiu J (2010) Characterization of the gene expression profile of human bocavirus. Virology 403(2):145-154</ref> unlike other parvoviruses where this has been examined.

The receptor for bovine parvovirus 1 is [[sialic acid]].

== Molecular biology ==

NS1 belongs to the superfamily III (SF3) [[helicase]]s all of which travel along DNA in a 3′-to-5′ direction. Four conserved sequence motifs in are found in SF3 helicases (A, B, B′, and C). These motifs form the nucleoside triphosphate binding pocket, the metal ion coordination site, the DNA-binding site and the sensory element. These motifs are in a stretch of approximately 100 amino acid residues in the middle of NS1. These helicases surround DNA as a ring of six or eight subunits with the ATP binding pocket lying between adjacent subunits. The first subunit provides the A and B motifs, and the [[arginine]] residue of the second subunit functions as a trans-acting arginine finger sensor for ATP binding and hydrolysis status. The arginine finger lies after the C motif but in three dimensions it is often embedded in a cluster of positively charged amino acids. In a ring configuration this domain interacts with the ATP binding pocket of the neighboring subunit.

NS1 binds to both the left and right hand origins of replication on the right with the host's own [[high mobility group]] proteins and on the left with [[glucocorticoid]] modulatory element-binding proteins. Origin recognition leads to strand- and site-specific nicking of viral DNA, processes that require ATP for tight binding and subsequent nicking. The NS1 protein remains covalently linked to the 5′ end of nicked DNA with the  3′-hydroxyl group being used for synthesis of the nascent strand. Replication of the genome is thought to be mediated by [[DNA polymerase]] δ. This polymerase is usually involved in repair of DNA after the excision of nucleotides. This process involves [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]], the single strand-binding protein [[replication protein A]] and NS1. In this process NS1 acts as an ATP powered helicase to resolve terminal hairpin structures of the viral genome.

In addition to these functions NS1 enhances transcription from a viral capsid promoter, may assist in packing DNA into newly formed capsids and is responsible for the cytopathic effect of parvoviruses.
