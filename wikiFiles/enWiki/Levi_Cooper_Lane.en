'''Levi Cooper Lane''' (May 9, 1828&nbsp;– February 9, 1902) was a physician and surgeon in [[San Francisco]] in the 1800s. He established the Cooper Medical College, forerunner to the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], as well as laying the groundwork for Stanford's medical library and the Stanford School of Nursing. The University's medical library is still named [[Lane Medical Library]] in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lane.stanford.edu/index.html|title=Lane Library|publisher=[[Lane Medical Library]]|accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Lane was born in [[Somerville, Ohio]] on May 9, 1828. He attended [[Farmer's College]] near [[Cincinnati]] and received an MA degree from [[Union Theological Seminary (New York)|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York City.

He received a medical degree from [[Thomas Jefferson University|Jefferson Medical College]] in Philadelphia in 1851. He interned for four years and then served in the U.S. Navy as an Assistant Surgeon from 1855 to 1859.<ref name = "cpmc" /> 

==Early career==

He then settled in [[San Francisco]], where his uncle, [[Elias Samuel Cooper]], also a physician, had just established the first medical college on the [[West Coast of the United States]] in 1858. The medical school was chartered by the College of the Pacific (now the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]). It was called the Medical Department of the College of the Pacific and was staffed entirely by local practicing physicians.<ref name="Medicine. 1959. Page 4">{{cite book|publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine]]|title=The First Hundred Years|location=[[San Francisco]]|year=1959|page=4}}</ref> Cooper served as president and chief surgeon; Lane became a faculty member.

After Cooper's death in 1862, the Medical Department ceased operation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=James H.|title=Edward Robeson Taylor. Part I: The Pre-Mayor Years|journal=[[The Argonaut (journal)|The Argonaut]]|publisher=[[San Francisco Museum and Historical Society]]|date=Spring 2007|volume=18|number=1|page=23}}</ref> Lane and other faculty members began teaching at the newly established Toland Medical College (later the [[University of California, San Francisco]]) instead.

==Later career==
Lane wanted to revive his uncle's college and in 1870 he succeeded in reopening it.<ref name="Barkan, Hans Page 146">{{cite journal|last=Barkan|first=Hans|title=Cooper Medical College, founded by Levi Cooper Lane: an Historical Sketch|journal=[[Stanford Medical Bulletin]]|date=August 1954|volume=12|number=3|page=146}}</ref> He served as president and recruited some of Cooper's former faculty members as instructors. The school was affiliated with University College, later the [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]], and the name was changed to the Medical College of the Pacific.<ref name="Shuman, Ronald J. 1974">{{cite book|last=Shuman|first=Ronald J|title=Portraits|location=San Francisco|publisher=[[Pacific Medical Center]]|year=1974}}</ref> 

Lane had bigger plans for the school, and in 1882 he renamed it Cooper Medical College, after his uncle, the founder. He moved it to a new brick building at Sacramento and Webster Streets which he had personally financed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap1/chap1-sect3.html|title=The Advent of Cooper Medical College (1870-1912)|work=eLane|publisher=[[Lane Medical Library]]|accessdate=2012-08-25}}</ref> He also built Lane Hospital and a nursing school, and made provision in his will for the construction of a freestanding medical library.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilbur|first1=Ray Lyman|last2=Carroll|first2=Paul|title=The Memoirs of Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1875-1949|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N1ejAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22lane+medical+library%22&source=bl&ots=TJ0d1Iegsh&sig=V2mAXtP1N3N6U3b7ru1Bcxkwbpg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jTo5UNrDLIrDygH1jIGwCg&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22lane%20medical%20library%22&f=false|pages=79–80}}</ref> 

==Death and legacy==
Lane died on February 9, 1902, and his widow died that August; one third of Lane's estate was bequeathed to Cooper Medical College to establish a medical library.<ref name="cpmc">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpmc.org/professionals/hslibrary/collections/archives/lane.html|title=Levi Cooper Lane, M.D. 1828-1902|work=Health Sciences Library|publisher=[[California Pacific Medical Center]]|accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> In 1908, Stanford acquired Cooper Medical College as the nucleus for the Stanford Medical Department, now the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]]. 

In 1910, Stanford also acquired the assets of the Levi C. Lane Medical Library Trust, consisting of 30,000 volumes as well as a building site and funds for the building of a library.<ref name="new building">{{cite book|last=Stanford University|title=New Building of the Stanford University Library and a History of the Library 1891-1919|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VmYZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=stanford+library&source=bl&ots=ZRqlfqahbH&sig=Yepjnjd1srmqonSTSZS1p66EGLw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QM43UMepKoTiqgGd7YDAAQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=stanford%20library&f=false|year=1919|publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}</ref> Lane Library was dedicated November 3, 1912, on the southeast corner of Webster and Sacramento Streets, across the street from the medical school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mKYaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22lane+medical+library%22&source=bl&ots=jm5bqHhtkW&sig=LMXQaS2h6M3_MaWt51KEMe20VMc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=szk5UIXDJcXcqgHau4HYCQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22lane%20medical%20library%22&f=false|title=Dedication of the Lane Medical Library|work=[[Stanford University]]|date=2012-11-03}}</ref> By then the medical school had become the Stanford University Department of Medicine. The medical school and Lane Library were moved to the main Stanford campus in 1959.<ref name="cpmc"/>
