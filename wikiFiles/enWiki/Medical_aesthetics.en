'''Medical Aesthetics''' is a branch of [[medicine]] which deals with beautification of body with help of [[medical]] knowledge and [[surgery]].<ref name="DevantierTurkington2006">{{cite book|last1=Devantier|first1=Alecia T.|last2=Turkington|first2=Carol|title=Extraordinary Jobs in Health and Science|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mNyu1fr2zZ0C&pg=PA78|accessdate=21 December 2011|date=December 2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-5858-7|pages=77â€“78|chapter=Medical Aesthetician}}</ref>{{dubious|Redundant.3F|date=December 2011}} It primarily covers treatments involved with the skin, though other parts of the body may be involved. Medical aestheticans find employment with dermatologists, hospitals, laser skin care clinics and spas.<ref name="DevantierTurkington2006"/>

In cases involving medical problems such as trauma, plastic surgery, cancer treatment and burn recovery, medical aesthetic procedures may be invoked for preventive or palliative reasons. In other cases, medical aesthetic procedures may be involved for cosmetic purposes.<ref name="DevantierTurkington2006"/> Medical aesthetics complements reconstruction surgery and the need for surgeons to incorporate this aesthetic sense, of how faces should be sculpted with soft tissue and bone, has been felt.<ref>http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/2015737/reload=0;jsessionid=j6lM9JTCqjYWSLG11lQa.125</ref>

The terms "medical aesthetics" and "medical cosmetology" are sometimes used ambiguously. Peng, Whang and Zhou (2000) opine that "the task of medical aesthetics is to study the human body in its entirety, concentrating on both internal and external beauty and put the findings into practice, whereas the task of medical cosmetology is to study and assess only the external beauty of the human body and to take action on that basis."<ref name="sciencedirect.com">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027795369500162Z</ref>

In the classical sense, the term "medical aesthetics" refers to the discipline of aesthetics in the field of medicine. However, skin care commercial entities have begun to describe personnel carrying out cosmetic intervention as "medical aestheticians". This has led to the term being considered disreputable in the medical fraternity.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

There is debate as to the relation between medical aesthetics on the one hand and classical subdisciplines of medicine such as dermatology and reconstructive/plastic surgery.<ref>http://www.indeed.com/forum/job/esthetician/Difference-between-medical-esthetician-others/t31171</ref> Medical professionals often come to this field through dermatology.

Considered to be a growth industry, medical aesthetics is a booming field according to some experts.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-28/news/29824967_1_corporate-hospitals-medical-aesthetics | work=The Times Of India | title=Corporate hospitals foraying into medical aesthetics | date=28 July 2011}}</ref> Medical cosmetology is criticised at times for the overwhelming majority of interventions for purely cosmetic or commercial reasons. This field has seen rapid progress amongst the Chinese medical community from the 1980s onwards.<ref name="sciencedirect.com"/>
