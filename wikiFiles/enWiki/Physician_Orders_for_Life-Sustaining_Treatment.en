'''POLST''' ('''Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment''') is a controversial approach to improving [[end-of-life care]] in the [[United States]] which seeks to doctors to speak with patients and create specific medical orders to be honored by health care workers during a medical crisis.<ref name=Meier>{{cite journal|last=Meier|first=D|coauthors=Beresford L|title=POLST Offers Next Stage in Honoring Patient Preferences|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|year=2009|volume=12|issue=4|pages=291–295|pmid=19327064}}</ref>   POLST began in Oregon in 1991 and is currently promoted in over 26 states through national and statewide initiatives.  The POLST document is a standardized, portable, brightly colored single page form which documents a conversation between a doctor and a seriously ill patient or their [[surrogate decision-maker]].  As a medical order, the POLST form is always signed by a doctor and, depending upon the state, the patient.  One benefit of a POLST form over a standard Advance Directive is that the POLST form is designed to be actionable throughout an entire community.  It is immediately recognizable and can be used by doctors and first responders (including paramedics, fire departments, police, emergency rooms, hospitals and nursing homes).  POLST forms should be filled out for all patients with life-limiting illnesses or progressive frailty. A pragmatic rule for initiating a POLST can be if the clinician would not be surprised if the patient were to die within one year.<ref name=AARP>{{cite web|last=Sabatino|first=C|title=Improving Advanced Illness Care: The Evolution of State POLST Programs|publisher=AARP Public Policy Institute|coauthors=Naomi Karp}}</ref> 

POLST orders are also known by other names: medical orders on life-sustaining treatment (MOLST), medical orders on scope of treatment (MOST), or physician’s orders on scope of treatment (POST).<ref name=Frieden>{{cite journal|last=Frieden|first=Joyce|title=Hospitals, LTC Facilities Are Moving Toward Newer End-of-Life Strategies: Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment orders are joined by default surrogate approach|journal=Caring For Aging|year=2008|pages=5|url=2.	http://www.ohsu.edu/polst/news/documents/CaringfortheAges.11.08.pdf}}</ref>

== What is POLST? ==

POLST represents a significant paradigm change in advance care policy by standardizing provider communications through a plan of care in a portable way, rather than focusing solely on standardizing patients’ communications via Advance Directives.<ref name=AARP /> 

The POLST paradigm requires providers and patients or their surrogates to 
accomplish three core tasks: 

:*First, POLST requires a health care professional to initiate a discussion with the patient (or the patient’s authorized surrogate) about treatment options in light of the patient’s current condition.<ref name=AARP />

:*Second, the patient’s preferences for end-of-life treatments are incorporated into medical orders, which are recorded on a highly visible, standardized form that is kept at the front of the medical record or with the patient if the patient lives in the community.<ref name=AARP />

:POLST forms record several treatment decisions common to seriously ill patients: cardiopulmonary resuscitation; the level of medical intervention desired in the event of an emergency (comfort only, limited treatment, or full treatment); and the use of artificial nutrition and hydration. Some states address additional interventions such as antibiotics and mechanical ventilation. As technology and treatment options change, POLST forms will also continue to evolve.<ref name=AARP />

:*Third, providers encourage that the POLST form travels with the individual whenever he or she moves from one setting to another, thereby promoting the continuity of care throughout a community.<ref name=AARP />

:The POLST form is designed to transfer across treatment settings, so it is readily available to medical personal, including EMTs, emergency physicians and nursing staff.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S|coauthors=Sabatino CP, Moss AH, Nester JW|title=The POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment) Paradigm to Improve End-of-Life Care: Potential State Legal Barriers to Implementation|journal=Journal Law Medical Ethics|year=2008|volume=36|pages=119–140|pmid=18315766}}</ref>  The POLST Program relies upon teamwork and coordinated systems to ensure preferences are honored throughout the heath care system. Research suggests the POLST form accurately represents patient treatment preferences the majority of the time <ref>{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S.E.|coauthors=Tolle SW, Brummel-Smith K, Carley MM|title=Use of the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment  Program in Oregon Nursing Facilities: Beyond Resuscitation Status,|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|year=2004|month=September|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1424–1429|pmid=15341541}}</ref>  and that the treatments provided at the end of life match the orders on the form.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=T|coauthors=Hickman SE, Tolle SW, Brooks HS|title=The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment Program: Oregon Emergency Medical Technicians Practical Experiences and Attitudes|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|year=2009|month=September|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1430–4|pmid=15341542}}</ref>  An established POLST program can help reduce unwanted hospitalizations and honor the patient’s end-of-life wishes.<ref name=Meier />

To determine whether a POLST form should be completed, clinicians should ask themselves, “Would I be surprised if this person died in the next year?” If the answer is that the patient’s prognosis is one year or less, then a POLST form is appropriate.<ref name=Dunn>{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Patrick|coauthors=Tolle S, Moss A, Black J|title=The Polst Paradigm: Respecting the Wishes of Patients and Families|journal=Annals of Long-Term Care|year=2007|volume=15}}</ref>  

In a 2006 consensus report, the National Quality Form observed that “compared with other advance directive programs, POLST more accurately conveys end-of-life preferences and yields higher adherence by medical professionals.” The National Quality Forum and other experts have recommended nationwide implementation of the POLST Paradigm <ref name=NQF>{{cite book|last=National Quality Forum|title=A National framework and preferred practices  for palliative and hospice care quality|year=National Quality Forum 2006|location=Washington D.C.|url=http://www.nationalconcensusproject.org/Downloads.asp}}</ref>

== Differences Between an Advance Directive and a POLST Form ==

Unlike advance directives, a POLST summarizes the patients’ wishes in the form of physician orders for end-of-life care.<ref name=Frieden /> 

POLST provides explicit guidance to health professionals under predictable future circumstances.<ref name=Meier />  POLST can build on an advance directive but can also function in the absence of an advance directive. If the individual lacks decisional capacity, a surrogate can engage in the conversation and the consent process that forms the basis of the POLST process.  

The challenges that patients, families and their healthcare professionals face at the end of life can be daunting. Caring and sensitive communication can elicit patients’ wishes which can then be documented in an advance directive.  To put these preferences into actionable orders requires an additional tool, the POLST form.  Healthcare professionals and their organizations can overcome the myriad barriers to communication across systems of care by developing a POLST program, creating a method that respects some of the most deeply held values of patients.<ref name="Dunn"/>

== POLST Research ==
 
:*In a 1998 study, charts of 180 residents at eight Oregon nursing facilities were evaluated over a one-year period. Where the POLST forms of residents included “do not resuscitate” and “comfort measures only” orders, none of the residents received unwanted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intensive care, or ventilator support.<ref name=Tolle>{{cite journal|last=Tolle|first=S|coauthors=Tilden VP, Dunn P, Nelson c|title=A Prospective Study of the Efficacy of the Physician Orders for Life  Sustaining Treatmen|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|year=1998|month=September|volume=46|issue=9|pages=1097–1102|pmid=9736102}}</ref>

:*In 2004, a survey of selected sites revealed that the POLST program was widely used in Oregon nursing facilities. Care matched POLST instructions to a high degree regarding CPR (91%), antibiotics (86%), intravenous fluids (84%), and feeding tubes (94%). Level-of-care instructions (from comfort care to full medical intervention) were followed less often (46%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S|coauthors=Tolle SW, Brummel-Smith K, Carley MM|title=Use of the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment  Program in Oregon Nursing Facilities: Beyond Resuscitation Statu|journal=Journal of American Geriatrics Society|year=2004|month=September|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1424–9|pmid=15341541}}</ref>

:*A 2004 survey of 572 EMTs in Oregon found that a large majority of EMTs felt that the POLST form provides clear instructions about patient preferences and is useful when deciding which treatments to provide.<ref name=AARP />

:*In 2009, researchers assessed the penetration of POLST in hospice programs in Oregon, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S|coauthors=Nelson CA, Moss A, Hammes BJ, Terwilliger A, Jackson A, Tolle SW|title=Use of the Physician Orders  for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Paradigm Program in the Hospice Settin|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|year=2009|month=February|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–141|pmid=19207056}}</ref>  A pilot study indicated that POLST was used widely in hospices in Oregon (100%) and West Virginia (85%) but only regionally in Wisconsin (6%). A majority of hospice staff believed POLST was useful in preventing unwanted resuscitation and initiating conversations about treatment preferences.<ref name=AARP />

== Future Goals ==

Susan Tolle M.D. and Patrick Dunn, M.D. are faculty at OHSU’s Center for Ethics in Health Care and provide support to those who wish to spread Oregon’s POLST Paradigm to other states.

Core features of successful programs include the robust ongoing training and education of health professionals. Communication skills and a commitment to improving end-of-life care are needed to implement POLST in a patient-centered, meaningful way. Ongoing monitoring, quality improvement and further research is critical to expand and improve the POLST process.<ref name=AARP />
