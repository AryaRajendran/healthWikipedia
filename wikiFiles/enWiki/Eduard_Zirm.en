'''Eduard Konrad Zirm''' (18 March 1863 - 15 March 1944) was an [[ophthalmologist]] who performed the first successful human [[tissue transplant]] on 7 December 1905.

Zirm was born in [[Vienna]], he studied [[medicine]] at the [[University of Vienna]],<ref name="EBAA">Eye Bank Association of America.[http://www.restoresight.org/general/anniversary.htm "100th Anniversary."]. Retrieved May 2, 2006.</ref> and ophthalmology at the Eye Clinic there.<ref>[http://www.drzirm.org/ehistory.html Dr. Zirm - Die erste gegl&uuml;ckte Organtransplantation - 1905<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.drzirm.org</ref> After graduation, Zirm became an eye doctor at the Second Eye Clinic in Vienna, then accepted a position at a hospital in [[Olomouc]], [[Moravia]], in 1892. There he became chief of the new ophthalmology clinic that he helped establish.<ref>[http://www.drzirm.org/ehistory.html Dr. Zirm - Die erste geglückte Organtransplantation - 1905<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==First corneal transplant==
In 1905, Zirm first met [[Alois Glogar]], a day laborer from a small town in the [[Czech Republic]] who had been blinded in both [[human eye|eye]]s a year earlier while [[Calcium hydroxide|slaking]] [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. Around the same time, an 11-year-old boy named [[Karl Brauer]] was brought to Zirm's clinic due to an accident that left metal pieces in his eyes. When attempts to save Brauer's eyes were unsuccessful, Zirm [[enucleation of the eye|enucleated]] them and saved the [[cornea]]s for [[cornea transplant|transplantation]] into Glogar's. Although complications affected one eye, the other remained clear allowing Glogar to return to work.<ref name="EBAA"/>

The operation and healing were difficult at that time because without a [[microscope]] it was impossible to [[surgical suture|suture]] the cornea. Therefore, Zirm successfully used sutures from the outside. Although eye surgeons around the world had been unsuccessful in the operation in humans for over a hundred years, parallel advances in [[anaesthesia]] and [[asepsis]] have also been credited in Zirm's success.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16402960 Centennial review of corneal transplantation. (Clin Experiment Ophthalmol. 2005) - PubMed Result<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ref> Zirm 's method remains the basis for repairing corneal damage.

Zirm also played the violin and in his limited spare time studied natural philosophy. His 1937 publication of Die Welt als Fühlen discussed ideas now called Emotional Intelligence for the first time. He also wrote many poems and stories.

At the jubilee lecture relative to corneal transplant, Prof. Böck, the longtime head of the second Ophthalmology Department at the University in Vienna said:
:''"The name of Dr. Eduard Zirm will always be connected with the great accomplishment of this medical technique. With pride the Ophthalmology Department of the University of Vienna includes him as one of its own".''

In 1944, Zirm died in [[Olomouc]], [[Czechoslovakia]].
