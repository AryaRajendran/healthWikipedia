[[Verrucous carcinoma]] is a type of [[squamous cell carcinoma]] that may be associated with HPV infection (usually HPV types 6 and 11).  Several subtypes of verrucous carcinoma have been described.  Treatment of verrucous carcinoma with radiation therapy should be avoided due to the risk of anaplastic transformation.
