'''Hymenorrhaphy''' or '''hymenoplasty''' or '''hymen reconstruction surgery''' is the [[surgical]] restoration of the [[hymen]].<ref name=debate>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=In Europe, Debate Over Islam and Virginity |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/world/europe/11virgin.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=hymen&st=nyt&oref=slogin |quote=Like an increasing number of Muslim women in Europe, she had a hymenoplasty, a restoration of her hymen, the vaginal membrane that normally breaks in the first act of intercourse. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-13 | first1=Elaine | last1=Sciolino | first2=Souad | last2=Mekhennet}}</ref> The term comes from the Greek words ''hymen'' meaning ''membrane'', and ''raphe'' meaning ''[[surgical suture|suture]]''. It is also known as '''''hymenoplasty''''', although strictly this term would also include [[hymenotomy]].

Such procedures are not generally regarded as part of mainstream [[gynecology]], but are available from some [[plastic surgery]] centers, particularly in the [[USA]], [[Japan]] and [[Western Europe]], generally as day surgery. The normal aim is to cause [[bleeding]] during post-nuptial [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]], which in some cultures is considered proof of [[virginity]].<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=5&chapter=22&verse=13&version=65&context=verse  Deuteronomy 22:13-19] ([[The Message (Bible)|The Message]])</ref>

== Varieties of the operation ==

The term may cover at least four significantly different types of procedure:

* [[surgical suture|Suturing]] of a tear in the hymen such as might be caused by [[sexual assault]], soon after the assault, to facilitate healing.
* A purely cosmetic procedure in which a membrane without blood supply is created, sometimes including a [[gelatine]] capsule of an artificial bloodlike substance. This operation is intended to be performed within a few days before an intended [[marriage]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sara Paterson-Brown|last=Paterson-Brown|title=Should doctors reconstruct the vaginal introitus of adolescent girls to mimic the virginal state?

* Use of a flap of the vaginal lining, complete with its blood supply, to create a new hymen. Patients are advised to refrain from [[Sexual intercourse|penetrative sex]] for up to three months following this procedure.
* The term ''hymen reconstruction'' has also been used to describe some varieties of [[infibulation]], requiring further surgery before penetration is possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

== Availability and legality ==

Some hymen reconstruction operations are legal in some countries, while other countries ban all hymenorrhaphy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1314090.stm | work=BBC News | title=Girls' secrets aired in Egypt | date=May 5, 2001 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Infibulation is generally illegal.

In the United States of America, hymen restoration is available in private clinics and becoming more common.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In France, some of the cost is reimbursed by the state in cases of rape or trauma.
