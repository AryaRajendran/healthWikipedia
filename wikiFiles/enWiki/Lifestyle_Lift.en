In 2012, [[Debby Boone]] became the spokesperson for the company in its television commercials and its half-hour [[infomercial]]; the song is well represented in both the commercials and in the infomercial.

The procedure is advertised as a minimally invasive, short flap [[face lift]] performed under [[local anesthesia]].

==Complaints==
===Marketing practices===
In 2009 Lifestyle Lift reached a settlement with [[New York]] state over claims it had posted false customer endorsements on third-party websites, including RealSelf.com,<ref name=Miller>{{cite news |title=Company Settles Case of Reviews It Faked |author=Claire Cain Miller |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/technology/internet/15lift.html?_r=2 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> and on some websites the company had created for the purpose.<ref name="O'Donnell">{{cite news |title=Cosmetic surgery gets cheaper, faster, scarier |last1=O'Donnell |first1=Jayne |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/basics/story/2011-09-14/risks-low-cost-cosmetic-surgery/50409740/1 |newspaper=USA Today |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Lifestyle Lift was ordered to pay $300,000 to the state, and it agreed to cease the practice.<ref name=Miller/>
In 2010, the [[Florida Attorney General]]'s office opened an investigation to determine whether Lifestyle Lift's marketing practices constituted deceptive advertising. Lifestyle Lift claimed its procedures were safer, less expensive, with faster recovery times. According to ''USA Today'', Lifestyle Lift's advertising used the term "revolutionary" to describe a variation on longstanding face-lift procedures.<ref name="O'Donnell"/>

===Safety issues===
In 2008, an [[Orlando, Florida]] plastic surgeon filed a complaint with the Florida Board of Medicine, seeking payment for emergency room services he provided to a Lifestyle Lift patient; the company denied that it was negligent in the case.<ref name="O'Donnell"/> Lifestyle Lift was also the subject of a March 2010 lawsuit filed by the family of a Massachusetts patient who died as a result of complications with local anesthesia in July 2009. The suit alleged that doctors failed to monitor the woman's vital signs during the procedure; in a statement, Lifestyle Lift responded that the woman had failed to disclose pertinent medical information.<ref name=Saltzman>{{cite news |title=Suit ties death of woman to face lift |author=Jonathan Saltzman |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/03/04/suit_ties_death_of_woman_to_face_lift/?page=1 |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> In an August 2011 lawsuit filed in [[Broward County, Florida]], a patient claimed she developed [[keloid]] scars within days following a Lifestyle Lift facelift, and that the doctor had lied about the risks of scarring.<ref name="Bekiempis1">{{cite news |title=Face-Lift Permanently Disfigures Broward Woman, Lawsuit Claims |last1=Bekiempis |first1=Victoria |url=http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2011/08/lifestyle_life_surgery_keloid.php |newspaper=New Times Broward-Palm Beach |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> In a statement to the press, Lifestyle Lift indicated disagreement with the "accounting of events" described in the suit, and said it remained supportive of its surgeon.<ref name="Bekiempis2">{{cite news |title=Plastic Surgeon Plans on Fighting Disfigurement Claim |last1=Bekiempis |first1=Victoria |url=http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2011/09/plastic_surgeon_plans_on_fight.php |newspaper=New Times Broward-Palm Beach |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> In 2010, The Florida Attorney General opened an investigation into Lifestyle Lift for allegations of false and misleading advertising & marketing of cosmetic surgery and facelifts.<ref>[http://myfloridalegal.com/__85256309005085AB.nsf/0/065138FEFDEFC44D8525772300508B80?Open&Highlight=0,lifestyle,lift Florida Attorney General website Lifestyle Lift investigation]</ref><ref>[http://www.wftv.com/news/news/woman-dies-after-facelift-procedure/nFBnK ″Woman dies after facelift procedure″ at Lifestyle Lift clinic in Maitland, FL]</ref>

==Procedure==
The procedure involves an incision made along the temple hairline and continuing down around the front of the ear or following the natural curves of the ear. The typical incision makes an S shape although the incision length and type can differ between surgeons and is individualized for each patient. The incision is made in front of and behind each ear.  Once these cuts are made, the deeper muscle or SMAS tissue is pulled up and back (and possibly trimmed) and sutured into place.  The excess skin is then trimmed off and the incision is closed.  Liposuction may be used to reduce fat from under the chin.  In addition, the muscle bands in the neck may be sutured together to lessen their appearance. 
Lifestyle Lift surgeons also perform eyelid surgeries, brow lifting, fractional CO2 laser skin resurfacing, fat grafting, and chin augmentation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prado A, Andrades P, Danilla S, Castillo P, Leniz P |title=A clinical retrospective study comparing two short-scar face lifts: minimal access cranial suspension versus lateral SMASectomy |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=1413–25; discussion 1426–7 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16641707 |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000207402.53411.1e}}</ref>
