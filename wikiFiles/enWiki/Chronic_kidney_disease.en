'''Chronic kidney disease''' (CKD), also known as '''chronic renal disease''', is a progressive loss in [[kidney|renal function]] over a period of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are non-specific, and might include feeling [[malaise|generally unwell]] and experiencing a [[Anorexia (symptom)|reduced appetite]]. Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of [[screening (medicine)|screening]] of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] or [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and those with a blood relative with chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as [[cardiovascular disease]], [[anemia]] or [[pericarditis]].<ref name=KDOQI>{{cite web | author=National Kidney Foundation | title=K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease | url=http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/guidelines_ckd | year=2002 | accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>

Chronic kidney disease is identified by a [[blood test]] for [[creatinine]]. Higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower [[glomerular filtration rate]] and as a result a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products. Creatinine levels may be normal in the early stages of CKD, and the condition is discovered if [[urinalysis]] (testing of a urine sample) shows that the kidney is allowing the loss of [[protein]] or [[red blood cell]]s into the urine. To fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of [[medical imaging]], blood tests and often renal [[biopsy]] (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed to find out if there is a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction.<ref name=KDOQI/> Recent professional guidelines classify the severity of chronic kidney disease in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called '''End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)''' and is synonymous with the now outdated terms '''chronic kidney failure (CKF)''' or '''chronic renal failure''' (CRF).<ref name=KDOQI/>

There is no specific treatment unequivocally shown to slow the worsening of chronic kidney disease. If there is an underlying cause to CKD, such as [[vasculitis]], this may be treated directly to slow the damage. In more advanced stages, treatments may be required for anemia and [[Renal osteodystrophy|bone disease]]. Severe CKD requires [[renal replacement therapy]], which may involve a form of [[dialysis]], but ideally constitutes a [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]].<ref name=KDOQI/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Combined hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia.png|thumb|300px|12-lead ECG of a person with chronic renal disease and a severe electrolyte imbalance: [[hyperkalemia]] (7.4 mmol/l) with [[hypocalcemia]] (1.6 mmol/l). The [[T wave|T-waves]] are peaked and the [[Prolonged QT interval|QT interval is prolonged]].]]
CKD is initially without specific symptoms and can only be detected as an increase in serum [[creatinine]] or protein in the urine. As the [[kidney]] function decreases:
* [[Blood pressure]] is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones created by the kidney via the RAS ([[renin-angiotensin system]]), increasing one's risk of developing [[hypertension]] and/or suffering from [[congestive heart failure]]
* [[Urea]] accumulates, leading to [[azotemia]] and ultimately [[uremia]] (symptoms ranging from lethargy to [[pericarditis]] and [[encephalopathy]]). Urea is excreted by sweating and crystallizes on skin ("uremic frost").
[[File:Uremic frost on forehead and scalp of young Afro-Caribbean male.jpg|thumb|300px|Uremic frost on the forehead and scalp of a young man who presented with complaints of chronic [[Anorexia (symptom) | anorexia]] and [[Fatigue (medical) | fatigue]] with [[blood urea nitrogen]] and serum [[creatinine]] levels of approximately 100 and 50 mg/dL respectively.]]
* [[Potassium]] accumulates in the blood (known as [[hyperkalemia]] with a range of symptoms including [[malaise]] and potentially fatal [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s)
* [[Erythropoietin]] synthesis is decreased (potentially leading to [[anemia]], which causes [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]])
* [[Fluid balance|Fluid volume overload]] — symptoms may range from mild [[edema]] to life-threatening [[pulmonary edema]]
* [[Hyperphosphatemia]] — due to reduced phosphate excretion
* [[Hypocalcemia]] — due to [[1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3|1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] deficiency. The 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> deficiency is due to stimulation of [[fibroblast growth factor-23]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Bacchetta J, Sea JL, Chun RF, Lisse TS |title=FGF23 inhibits extra-renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in human monocytes |journal=J Bone Miner Res. |year=2012 |month=August |pmid=22886720 |doi=10.1002/jbmr.1740 |volume=28 |pages=46–55 |issue=1 |pmc=3511915}}</ref>
** Later this progresses to [[secondary hyperparathyroidism]], [[renal osteodystrophy]] and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function.
* [[Metabolic acidosis]], due to accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, uric acid etc. This may cause altered enzyme activity by excess acid acting on enzymes and also increased excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by the promotion of [[hyperkalemia]] due to excess acid ([[acidemia]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adrogué HJ, Madias NE |title=Changes in plasma potassium concentration during acute acid-base disturbances |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=456–67 |year=1981 |month=September |pmid=7025622 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(81)90182-0}}</ref>

People with chronic kidney disease suffer from accelerated [[atherosclerosis]] and are more likely to develop [[cardiovascular disease]] than the general population. Patients afflicted with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease tend to have significantly worse prognoses than those suffering only from the latter.

==Causes==
The most common causes of CKD are [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], and [[glomerulonephritis]].<ref>http://www.usrds.org/</ref>  Together, these cause approximately 75% of all adult cases. Certain geographic areas have a high incidence of HIV nephropathy.

Historically, kidney disease has been classified according to the part of the renal anatomy that is involved.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
* [[Vascular]], includes large vessel disease such as bilateral [[renal artery stenosis]] and small vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] and [[vasculitis]]
* Glomerular, comprising a diverse group and subclassified into
** Primary Glomerular disease such as [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] and [[IgA nephritis]]
** Secondary Glomerular disease such as [[diabetic nephropathy]] and [[lupus nephritis]]
* Tubulointerstitial including [[polycystic kidney disease]], drug and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and [[reflux nephropathy]]
* Obstructive such as with bilateral [[kidney stone]]s and diseases of the [[prostate]]
* On rare cases, pin worms infecting the kidney can also cause nephropathy.
<!--* ''more to be added''-->

==Diagnosis==
In many CKD patients, previous renal disease or other underlying diseases are already known. A small number present with CKD of unknown cause. In these patients, a cause is occasionally identified retrospectively.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

It is important to differentiate CKD from [[acute renal failure]] (ARF) because ARF can be reversible. Abdominal [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], in which the size of the [[kidney]]s is measured, is commonly performed. Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller (< 9&nbsp;cm) than normal kidneys, with notable exceptions such as in [[diabetic nephropathy]] and [[polycystic kidney disease]]. Another diagnostic clue that helps differentiate CKD from ARF is a gradual rise in serum creatinine (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine (several days to weeks). If these levels are unavailable (because the patient has been well and has had no blood tests), it is occasionally necessary to treat a patient briefly as having ARF until it has been established that the renal impairment is irreversible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Additional tests may include [[nuclear medicine]] [[MAG3 scan]] to confirm blood flows and establish the differential function between the two kidneys. [[dimercaptosuccinic acid|DMSA]] scans are also used in renal imaging; with both MAG3 and DMSA being used [[chelation|chelated]] with the radioactive element [[Technetium-99]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In chronic renal failure treated with standard dialysis, numerous uremic toxins accumulate. These toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum, have different molecular weights and some of them are bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Such toxic protein bound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic dialysis procedures used today.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Stages===
All individuals with a [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for 3 months are classified as having chronic kidney disease, irrespective of the presence or absence of kidney damage. The rationale for including these individuals is that reduction in kidney function to this level or lower represents loss of half or more of the adult level of normal kidney function, which may be associated with a number of complications.<ref name=KDOQI/>

All individuals with kidney damage are classified as having chronic kidney disease, irrespective of the level of GFR. The rationale for including individuals with GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> is that GFR may be sustained at normal or increased levels despite substantial kidney damage and that patients with kidney damage are at increased risk of the two major outcomes of chronic kidney disease: loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease.<ref name=KDOQI/>

The [[proteinuria|loss of protein in the urine]] is regarded as an independent marker for worsening of renal function and cardiovascular disease. Hence, British guidelines append the letter "P" to the stage of chronic kidney disease if there is significant protein loss.<ref name=NICE>{{NICE|73|Chronic kidney disease|2008}}</ref>

;Stage 1
Slightly diminished function; kidney damage with normal or relatively high GFR (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine test or imaging studies.<ref name=KDOQI/>

;Stage 2
Mild reduction in GFR (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) with kidney damage. Kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine test or imaging studies.<ref name=KDOQI/>

;Stage 3
Moderate reduction in GFR (30–59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=KDOQI/> British guidelines distinguish between stage 3A (GFR 45–59) and stage 3B (GFR 30–44) for purposes of screening and referral.<ref name=NICE/>

;Stage 4
Severe reduction in GFR (15–29 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)<ref name=KDOQI/>
Preparation for renal replacement therapy

;Stage 5
Established kidney failure (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, permanent renal replacement therapy (RRT),<ref name=KDOQI/> or end stage renal disease (ESRD)
{{more|End Stage Renal Disease (US Federal Program)}}

=== NDD-CKD vs. ESRD ===
The term '''non-dialysis dependent''' [[CKD]], also abbreviated as '''NDD-CKD''', is a designation used to encompass the status of those persons with an established [[CKD]] who do not yet require the life-supporting treatments for [[renal failure]] known as [[renal replacement therapy]] (including maintenance [[dialysis]] or [[renal transplantation]]).  The condition of individuals with [[CKD]], who require either of the 2 types of [[renal replacement therapy]] ([[dialysis]] or [[organ transplant|transplantation]]), is referred to as the '''end-stage renal disease''' ('''ESRD'''). Hence, the start of the ESRD is practically the [[irreversible]] conclusion of the NDD-CKD. Even though the '''non-dialysis dependent''' status refers to the status of persons with earlier stages of [[CKD]] (stages 1 to 4), patients with advanced stage of [[CKD]] (Stage 5), who have not yet started [[renal replacement therapy]] are also referred to as NDD-CKD.

==Screening and referral==
Early identification of patients with kidney disease is recommended, as measures may be instituted to slow progression and mitigate cardiovascular risk.  Among those who should be screened are subjects with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged > 60 years, subjects with indigenous (native American Indian, First Nations) racial origin, those with a history of renal disease in the past, as well as subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis.  Screening should include calculation of estimated GFR/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> from the serum creatinine level, and measurement of urine-to-albumin creatinine ratio in a first-morning urine specimen as well as dipstick screen for hematuria. <ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=David |editor-first=John |editor-last=Daugirdas |title=Handbook of Chronic Kidney Disease Management |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |date=2011-05-02 |pages=32–43 |chapter=Chapter 4: CKD Screening and Management: Overview |chapterurl=http://hdcn.com/CKDhandbook/toc.htm  |isbn=1-58255-893-0}}</ref>  Guidelines for nephrologist referral vary among different countries.  Nephrology referral is useful when eGFR/1.73m<sup>2</sup> is less than 30 or decreasing by more than 3 mL/min/year, when urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is more than 30 mg/g, when blood pressure is difficult to control, or when hematuria or other findings suggest either a primarily glomerular disorder or secondary disease amenable to specific treatment.  Other benefits of early nephrology referral include proper patient education regarding options for renal replacement therapy as well as pre-emptive transplantation, and timely workup and placement of an arteriovenous fistula in those patients opting for future hemodialysis.

==Treatment==
The presence of chronic kidney disease confers a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and people with CKD often have other risk factors for heart disease, such as [[hyperlipidemia]]. The most common cause of death in people with CKD is therefore cardiovascular disease rather than renal failure. Aggressive treatment of hyperlipidemia is warranted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chauhan V, Vaid M |title=Dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease: managing a high-risk combination |journal=Postgrad Med |volume=121 |issue=6 |pages=54–61 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19940417 |doi=10.3810/pgm.2009.11.2077}}</ref>

Apart from controlling other risk factors, the goal of therapy is to slow down or halt the progression of CKD to stage 5. Control of [[blood pressure]] and treatment of the original disease, whenever feasible, are the broad principles of management. Generally, [[angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor]]s (ACEIs) or [[angiotensin II receptor antagonists]] (ARBs) are used, as they have been found to slow the progression of CKD to stage 5.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruggenenti P, Perna A, Gherardi G, Gaspari F, Benini R, Remuzzi G |title=Renal function and requirement for dialysis in chronic nephropathy patients on long-term ramipril: REIN follow-up trial.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major concern in African Americans, mostly due to increased prevalence of hypertension.

Studies have shown that there is a true association between history of chronic renal failure in first or second-degree relatives, and risk of disease.<ref name=Kiag>{{cite journal |author=Klag MJ, Whelton PK, Randall BL, Neaton JD, Brancati FL, Stamler J |title=End-stage renal disease in African-American and white men. 16-year MRFIT findings |journal=JAMA |volume=277 |issue=16 |pages=1293–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9109467 |doi=10.1001/jama.1997.03540400043029 }}</ref> In addition, African Americans may have higher serum levels of human leukocyte antigens (HLA).<ref name=Kiag/> High HLA concentrations can contribute to increased systemic inflammation, which indirectly may lead to heightened susceptibility for developing kidney disease. Lack of nocturnal reduction in blood pressure among groups of African Americans is also offered as an explanation,<ref name=Kiag/> which lends further credence to a genetic etiology of CKD racial disparities.

A high, and so-far, unexplained incidence of chronic kidney disease has been noted among male sugar cane workers in Central America, specifically in the low-lands of San Salvador and Nicaragua. Heat stress from long hours of piece-rate work at high average temperatures (in the range of 96°F) is suspected as are agricultural chemicals.<ref name=ICIJ121211>{{cite news|title=Thousands of sugar cane workers die as wealthy nations stall on solutions|url=http://www.icij.org/project/island-widows/thousands-sugar-cane-workers-die-wealthy-nations-stall-solutions|accessdate=November 26, 2012|newspaper=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|date=December 12, 2011|author=Sasha Chavkin|author2=Ronnie Greene}}</ref><ref name=MEDICC1012>{{cite journal|last=Orantes|first=Carlos M.|coauthors=Raúl Herrera, Miguel Almaguer, Elsy G.

==Organizations==
In the USA, the [[National Kidney Foundation]] is a national organization representing patients and professionals who treat kidney diseases. The [[American Kidney Fund]] (AKF) is a national non-profit organization providing treatment-related financial assistance to 1 out of every 5 dialysis patients each year. The [[Renal Support Network]] (RSN) is a nonprofit, patient-focused, patient-run organization that provides non-medical services to those affected by CKD. The [[American Association of Kidney Patients]] (AAKP) is a non-profit, patient-centric group focused on improving the health and well-being of CKD and [[dialysis]] patients. The [[Renal Physicians Association]] (RPA) is an association representing [[nephrology]] professionals.

In the United Kingdom, the [[UK National Kidney Federation]] represents patients, and the [[Renal Association]] represents renal physicians and works closely with the [[National Service Framework]] for kidney disease.

[[Kidney Health Australia]] serves that country.

The [[International Society of Nephrology]] is an international body representing specialists in kidney diseases.
