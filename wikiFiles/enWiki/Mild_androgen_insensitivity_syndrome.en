'''Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome''' ('''MAIS''') is a condition that results in a mild impairment of the [[Eukaryote#Animal cell|cell]]'s ability to respond to [[androgen]]s.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The degree of impairment is sufficient to impair [[spermatogenesis]] and / or the development of [[Secondary sex characteristics|secondary sexual characteristics]] at [[puberty]] in males, but does not affect [[sexual differentiation|genital differentiation]] or [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|development]]. Female genital and sexual development is not significantly affected by the insensitivity to androgens<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2002 giwercman 87" />; as such, MAIS is only diagnosed in males.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> The clinical [[phenotype]] associated with MAIS is a normal [[body shape|male habitus]] with mild [[spermatogenesis|spermatogenic]] defect and / or reduced secondary [[terminal hair]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2001 giwercman 54" /><ref name="2003 lund 79" />

MAIS is one of three types of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], which is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|genital masculinization]]: [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal female, mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal male, and [[partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is partially, but not fully masculinized.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2010 ozulker 24" /><ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /><ref name="2005 kawate 90" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" />

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY [[Intersexuality#Conditions|undermasculinization]].<ref name="1999 ahmed 80" />

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|150px|Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) presenting with a mild impairment of virilization in a 23-year-old man.<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" />]]
Individuals with mild (or minimal) androgen insensitivity syndrome (grade 1 on the Quigley scale) are born [[phenotype|phenotypically]] male, with fully [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|masculinized]] genitalia; this category of androgen insensitivity is diagnosed when the degree of androgen insensitivity in an individual with a [[karyotype|46,XY karyotype]] is great enough to impair [[Puberty#Physical changes in boys|virilization]] or [[spermatogenesis]], but is not great enough to impair normal male genital development.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 lund 79" /> MAIS is the mildest and least known form of androgen insensitivity syndrome.<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="1998 wang 54" />

The existence of a variant of androgen insensitivity that solely affected [[spermatogenesis]] was theoretical at first.<ref name="1998 wang 83" /> Cases of phenotypically normal males with [[Male infertility|isolated spermatogenic defect]] due to AR mutation were first detected as the result of [[male infertility]] evaluations.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /><ref name="2008 oakes 21" /><ref name="2003 yong 9" /> Until then, early evidence in support of the existence of MAIS was limited to cases involving a mild defect in [[Puberty#Physical changes in boys|virilization]],<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1988 grino 66" /> although some of these early cases made allowances for some degree of impairment of [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|genital masculinization]], such as [[hypospadias]] or [[micropenis]].<ref name="1999 shkolny 84" /><ref name="1984 pinsky 36" /><ref name="1994 tsukada 79" /> It is estimated that 2-3% of infertile men have AR gene mutations.<ref name="2006 ferlin 65" />

Examples of MAIS phenotypes include isolated infertility (oligospermia or azoospermia),<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /> mild [[gynecomastia]] in young adulthood, decreased [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary]] [[terminal hair]], high pitched voice, or minor [[hypospadias]] repair in childhood.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2002 zenteno 57" /> The [[Male external genitalia|external male genitalia]] ([[penis]], [[scrotum]], and [[urethra]]) are otherwise normal in individuals with MAIS.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 lund 79" /> [[Male internal genitalia|Internal genitalia]], including [[Wolffian structures]] (the [[epididymis|epididymides]], [[vas deferens|vasa deferentia]], and [[seminal vesicles]]) and the [[prostate]], is also normal, although the [[Testicle size|bitesticular volume]] of infertile men (both with and without MAIS) is diminished <ref name="2006 ferlin 65" />; [[male infertility]] is associated with reduced bitesticular volume, [[varicocele]], [[retractile testes]], low [[Ejaculation#Volume|ejaculate volume]], [[male accessory gland]] infections (MAGI), and [[mumps]] [[orchitis]].<ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /> The incidence of these features in infertile men with MAIS is similar to that of infertile men without MAIS.<ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /> MAIS is not associated with [[Müllerian duct|Müllerian]] remnants.

===Kennedy Disease===
[[Kennedy disease]], also known as spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is a severe [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] syndrome that is associated with a particular mutation of the [[androgen receptor]]'s [[polyglutamine tract]] called a [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder|trinucleotide repeat expansion]].<ref name="2001 casella 58" /><ref name="2002 dejager 87" /> SBMA results when the length of the polyglutamine tract exceeds 40 repetitions.<ref name="1991 la spada 352" />

Although technically a variant of MAIS, SBMA's presentation is not typical of androgen insensitivity; symptoms do not occur until adulthood and include [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscular]] defects as well as signs of androgen inaction.<ref name="2001 casella 58" /> Neuromuscular symptoms include progressive proximal muscle weakness, [[Muscle atrophy|atrophy]], and [[fasciculations]]. Symptoms of androgen insensitivity experienced by men with SBMA are also progressive <ref name="2001 casella 58" /> and include testicular atrophy, severe [[oligospermia]] or [[azoospermia]], [[gynecomastia]], and feminized skin changes <ref name="1983 arbizu 59" /> despite elevated androgen levels.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> Disease onset, which usually affects the [[proximal]] musculature first, occurs in the third to fifth decades of life, and is often preceded by muscular cramps on exertion, tremor of the hands, and elevated muscle [[creatine kinase]].<ref name="1998 choong 21" /> SBMA is often misdiagnosed as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease).<ref name="2002 dejager 87" />

The symptoms of SBMA are thought to be brought about by two simultaneous pathways involving the toxic [[misfolding]] of proteins and loss of AR functionality.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> The polyglutamine tract in affected pedigrees tends to increase in length over generations, a phenomenon known as "[[Anticipation (genetics)|anticipation]]",<ref name="1992 biancalana 1" /> leading to an increase in the severity of the disease as well as a decrease in the age of onset for each subsequent generation of a family affected by SBMA.<ref name="2001 casella 58" />

===Comorbidity===
[[File:Histopathology of androgen insensitivity.jpg|thumb|Histopathology of testicular tissue showing immature germ cells and spermatagonia with decreased tubular diameter. Scattered groups of Leydig cells appearing immature.<ref name="2009 nichols 91" />]]

All forms of androgen insensitivity are associated with [[infertility]], though exceptions have been reported for both the mild and partial forms.<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2002 chu 87" /><ref name="2005 menakaya 25" /><ref name="2000 giwercman 85" /> Lifespan is not thought to be affected by AIS.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />

==Trinucleotide Satellite Lengths and AR Transcriptional Activity==
{{Main|Androgen insensitivity syndrome#Genetics|l1=Genetics of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome}}
The [[androgen receptor]] gene contains two [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetic polymorphism|polymorphic]] [[nucleotide|trinucleotide]] [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] in exon 1.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> The first microsatellite (nearest the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5′-end|5']] end) contains 8 <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> to 60 <ref name="2002 dejager 87" /><ref name="1998 choong 21" /> repetitions of the [[glutamine]] [[codon]] "CAG" and is thus known as the [[polyglutamine tract]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The second microsatellite contains 4 <ref name="2010 audi 95" /> to 31 <ref name="1997 lumbroso 101" /> repetitions of the [[glycine]] codon "GGC" and is known as the [[polyglycine tract]].<ref name="1999 gottlieb 89" /> The average number of repetitions varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians exhibiting an average of 21 CAG repeats, and Blacks 18.<ref name="1992 edwards 12" /> Disease states are associated with extremes in polyglutamine tract length; [[prostate cancer]],<ref name="2001 casella 58" /> [[hepatocellular carcinoma]],<ref name="2007 yeh 120" /> and [[mental retardation]] <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> are associated with too few repetitions, while [[spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy]] (SBMA) is associated with a CAG repetition length of 40 or more.<ref name="1991 la spada 352" /> Some studies indicate that the length of the polyglutamine tract is inversely correlated with [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional activity]] in the AR protein, and that longer polyglutamine tracts may be associated with [[infertility]] <ref name="2003 casella 169" /><ref name="1999 dowsing 354" /><ref name="1997 tut 82" /> and [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|undermasculinized genitalia]].<ref name="2000 lim 9" /> However, other studies have indicated that no such correlation exists.<ref name="2000 hiort 85" /><ref name="2002 kukuvitis 25" /><ref name="2001 von eckardstein 86" /><ref name="2002 rajpert-de meyts 359" /><ref name="1999 hiort 354" /><ref name="2001 muroya 7" /> A comprehensive [[meta-analysis]] of the subject published in 2007 supports the existence of the correlation, and concluded that these discrepancies could be resolved when [[sample size]] and study design are taken into account.<ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /> Longer polyglycine tract lengths have also been associated with genital masculinization defects in some,<ref name="2007 radpour 28" /><ref name="2004 aschim 89" /> but not all,<ref name="2006 rajender 27" /> studies.

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Androgen insensitivity syndrome|l1=Diagnosis of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome}}
MAIS is only diagnosed in normal phenotypic males, and is not typically investigated except in cases of [[male infertility]].<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /> MAIS has a mild presentation that often goes unnoticed and untreated <ref name="1989 pinsky 32" />; even with semenological, clinical and laboratory data, it can be difficult to distinguish between men with and without MAIS, and thus a diagnosis of MAIS is not usually made without confirmation of an [[androgen receptor|AR gene]] [[mutation]].<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /> The [[androgen]] sensitivity index (ASI), defined as the product of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[testosterone]] (T), is frequently raised in individuals with all forms of AIS, including MAIS, although many individuals with MAIS have an ASI in the normal range.<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /> Testosterone levels may be elevated despite normal levels of luteinizing hormone.<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1988 grino 66" /><ref name="2002 zenteno 57" /> Conversion of testosterone (T) to [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) may be impaired, although to a lesser extent than is seen in [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency|5α-reductase deficiency]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> A high ASI in a normal phenotypic male,<ref name="2000 hiort 85" /> especially when combined with [[azoospermia]] or [[oligospermia]],<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /> decreased [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary]] [[terminal hair]],<ref name="2002 dejager 87" /> and/or impaired conversion of T to DHT, <ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> can be indicative of MAIS, and may warrant [[genetic testing]].

==Management==
Due to its mild presentation, MAIS often goes unnoticed and untreated.<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /> Management of MAIS is currently limited to [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic management]]; methods to correct a malfunctioning [[androgen receptor]] protein that result from an AR gene [[mutation]] are not currently available. Treatment includes surgical correction of mild [[gynecomastia]], minor [[hypospadias]] repair, and [[androgen replacement therapy|testosterone supplementation]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1994 yong 344" /> Supraphysiological doses of testosterone have been shown to correct diminished [[secondary sexual characteristics]] in men with MAIS,<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /> as well as to reverse [[infertility]] due to low sperm count.<ref name="1994 yong 344" /><ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> As is the case with PAIS, men with MAIS will experience side effects from [[androgen]] therapy (such as the suppression of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]]) at a higher dosage than unaffected men. Careful monitoring is required to ensure the safety and efficacy of treatment.<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1998 weidemann 83" /><ref name="1997 tincello 46" /> Regular [[breast exam|breast]] <ref name="1998 weidemann 83" /> and [[Rectal examination|prostate]] <ref name="2006 nieschlag 65" /> examinations may be necessary due to [[comorbidity|comorbid]] association with [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[prostate cancer|prostate]] cancers.
