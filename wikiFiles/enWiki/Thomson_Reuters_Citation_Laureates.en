'''Thomson Reuters Citation Laureates''' is a list of candidates considered likely to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in their respective field. The candidates are so named based on the impact of their published [[research]]. The list of awardees is announced annually prior to the Nobel Prize ceremonies of that year.

==Overview==
''Thomson Reuters Citation Laureates'' was established in 1989. The list pertains to likely [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize winners]] in medicine, chemistry, physics, and economics. There appears to be a correlation between high citation rates for a published researcher and the award of prestigious accolades. Furthermore, citation rates disclose researchers furnishing instrumental contributions that advance the science of their respective field. Finally, choosing one tenth of one percent (0.1%) of the highest impact papers winnows the analysis to the topics and people most likely to be selected by Nobel selection committee. <ref name=nature>
