The '''cricoid cartilage''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|k|r|aɪ|k|ɔɪ|d|_|ˈ|k|ɑː|r|t|ɪ|l|ɪ|dʒ|}}), or simply '''cricoid''' (from the Greek ''krikoeides'' meaning "ring-shaped"), is the only complete ring of [[cartilage]] around the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]].

==Location==
The cricoid cartilage sits just inferior to the [[thyroid cartilage]] in the [[neck]], and is joined to it medially by the median [[cricothyroid ligament]] and postero-laterally by the cricothyroid joints. [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|Inferior]] to it are the rings of cartilage around the trachea (which are not continuous - rather they are C-shaped with a gap posteriorly). The cricoid is joined to the first tracheal ring by the [[cricotracheal ligament]], and this can be felt as a more yielding area between the firm thyroid cartilage and firmer cricoid.

It is also anatomically related to the [[thyroid]] gland; although the [[thyroid isthmus]] is inferior to it, the two lobes of the thyroid extend superiorly on each side of the cricoid as far as the thyroid cartilage above it.

The [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] part of the cricoid is slightly broader than the anterior and lateral parts, and is called the [[lamina (anatomy)|lamina]], while the [[anterior]] part is the band; this may be the reason for the common comparison made between the cricoid and a [[signet ring]].

==Function==
The function of the cricoid cartilage is to provide attachments for the [[cricothyroid muscle]], [[posterior cricoarytenoid|posterior cricoarytenoid muscle]] and [[lateral cricoarytenoid|lateral cricoarytenoid muscle]] muscles, cartilages, and [[ligament]]s involved in opening and closing the [[Vertebrate trachea|airway]] and in [[Phonation|speech production]].

==Composition==
It is made of [[hyaline cartilage]], and so can become [[chondrocalcinosis|calcified]] or even [[ossification|ossified]], particularly in old age.

==Clinical significance==
When [[Tracheal intubation|intubating]] a patient under [[general anesthesia]] prior to surgery, the [[anesthesiologist]] will press on the cricoid cartilage to compress the esophagus behind it so as to prevent [[gastric reflux]] from occurring: this is known as the [[Sellick manoeuvre]]. The Sellick Manouevre is typically only applied during a Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI), an induction technique reserved for those at high risk of aspiration.

The Sellick maneuver was considered the standard of care during [[rapid sequence induction]] for many years.<ref>Salem MR, Sellick BA, Elam JO. The historical background of cricoid pressure in anesthesia and resuscitation. Anesth Analg 1974;53(2):230-232.</ref> The American Heart Association still advocates the use of cricoid pressure during resuscitation using a [[Bag valve mask|BVM]], and during emergent oral endotracheal intubation.<ref>American Heart Association (2006). Textbook of Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Dallas, TX: American Heart Association.</ref>  However, recent research increasingly suggests that cricoid pressure may not be as advantageous as once thought. The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning, and barbiturate anesthesia were the rule.<ref>Maltby, J. M., & Berialt, M. T. (2002). Science, pseudoscience and Sellick. Canadian Journal of Anesthesia, 49(5), 443-447</ref>

Cricoid pressure: knowledge and performance amongst anaesthetic assistants.

Anesthesia (2001), 56; 825-828</ref> Based on the current literature, the widespread recommendation that cricoid pressure be applied during every rapid sequence intubation is quickly falling out of favor.
 

Gastric reflux could cause [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] if this is not done considering the general anesthesia can cause relaxation of the [[gastroesophageal sphincter]] allowing stomach contents to ascend through the esophagus into the trachea.

A medical procedure known as a [[cricoidectomy]] can be performed in which part or all of the cricoid cartilage is removed.  This is commonly done to relieve [[stenosis|blockages]] within the trachea.<ref>Michihiko Sonea1; Tsutomu Nakashimaa1; Noriyuki Yanagita (1995) "Laryngotracheal separation under local anaesthesia for intractable salivary aspiration: cricoidectomy with fibrin glue support" ''The Journal of Laryngology & Otology:Cambridge University Press''</ref>
