'''Pulseless electrical activity''' or '''PEA''' (also known by the older terms '''electromechanical dissociation''') refers to a [[cardiac arrest]] situation in which a heart rhythm is observed on the [[electrocardiogram]] that should be producing a [[pulse]], but is not. Under normal circumstances, electrical activation of muscle cells precedes mechanical contraction of the heart (known as ''electromechanical coupling''). In PEA, there is electrical activity, but the heart either does not contract or there are other reasons why this results in an insufficient [[cardiac output]] to generate a pulse and supply blood to the organs.<ref name="2010AHA" />

[[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is the first treatment for PEA, while potential underlying causes are identified and treated. Various drugs may be administered.<ref name="2010AHA" />

==Signs and symptoms==
Pulseless electrical activity leads to a loss of cardiac output, and the blood supply to the [[brain]] is interrupted. As a result, PEA is usually noticed because a person [[Unconsciousness|loses consciousness]] and stops [[breathing]] spontaneously. This is confirmed by examining the [[airway]] for obstruction, observing the chest for respiratory movement, and feeling the [[pulse]] (usually at the [[carotid artery]]) for a period of 10 seconds.<ref name="2010AHA" />

==Causes==
These possible causes are remembered as the 6 Hs and the 6 Ts.<ref name=ACLS_2003_H_T>{{cite book |author=Mazur, Glen |title=Acls: Principles And Practice |publisher=Amer Heart Assn |location=[Dallas, TX] |year=2003 |pages=71–87 |isbn=0-87493-341-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=ACLS_2003_EP_HT>{{cite book |author=Barnes, Thomas Garden; Cummins, Richard O.; Field, John; Hazinski, Mary Fran |title=ACLS for experienced providers |publisher=American Heart Association |location=[Dallas, TX] |year=2003 |pages=3–5 |isbn=0-87493-424-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="ECC_2005_7.2">{{cite journal |author=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |title=Part 7.2: Management of Cardiac Arrest |journal=Circulation  |year=2005 |month=December |volume=112 |issue=24 Suppl |pages=IV 58–66 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166557 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-58}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The absence of a pulse confirms cardiac arrest, but PEA can only be distinguished from other causes of cardiac arrest with a device capable of [[electrocardiography]] (ECG/EKG). In PEA, there is electrical activity in the heart (as opposed to [[asystole]]), but not compatible with either [[ventricular fibrillation]] or [[ventricular tachycardia]].<ref name="2010AHA" />

==Treatment==
[[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] is initiated immediately. The approach in treatment of PEA is to treat the underlying cause, if known (e.g. relieving a tension pneumothorax). Where an underlying cause for PEA cannot be determined and/or reversed, the treatment of pulseless electrical activity is similar to that for [[asystole]].<ref name="2010AHA" />

The mainstay of drug therapy for PEA is [[epinephrine]] 1&nbsp;mg every 3–5 minutes. Although previously the use of [[atropine]] was recommended in the treatment of PEA/asystole, this recommendation was withdrawn in 2010 by the American Heart Association due to lack of evidence for therapeutic benefit.<ref name="2010AHA">{{cite journal |author=2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |title=Part 8: Adult Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support|journal=Circulation  |year=2010 |month=November |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl |pages=S729–S767 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S729 |pmid=20956224}}</ref>

Sodium bicarbonate 1meq per kilogram may be considered in this rhythm as well, although there is little evidence to support this practice. Its routine use is not recommended for patients in this context, except in special situations (e.g. preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, [[tricyclic antidepressant overdose]]).<ref name="2010AHA" />

All of these drugs should be administered along with appropriate CPR techniques. [[Defibrillator]]s are not used for this rhythm, as the problem lies in the response of the myocardial tissue to electrical impulses.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
