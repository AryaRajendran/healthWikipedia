A '''biofilm'''  is any group of [[microorganism]]s in which [[cell (biology)|cell]]s stick to each other on a surface.  These adherent cells are frequently embedded within a self-produced matrix of [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS). Biofilm EPS, which is also referred to as '''slime''' (although not everything described as [[Gunge|slime]] is a biofilm), is a [[polymer]]ic conglomeration generally composed of extracellular [[DNA]], [[protein]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s.  Biofilms may form on living or non-living surfaces and can be prevalent in natural, industrial and hospital settings.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hall-Stoodley L, Costerton JW, Stoodley P |title=Bacterial biofilms: from the natural environment to infectious diseases |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature Reviews.

==Formation==
Formation of a biofilm begins with the attachment of free-floating microorganisms to a surface.  These first colonists adhere to the surface initially through weak, reversible adhesion via [[van der Waals force]]s.  If the colonists are not immediately separated from the surface, they can anchor themselves more permanently using [[cell adhesion]] structures such as [[pilus|pili]].<ref>JPG Images: [http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dir/labs/images/ottofig.jpg niaid.nih.gov] [http://www.erc.montana.edu/Res-Lib99-SW/Image_Library/Structure-Function/Images-full/CBE-03_ComplexBf.jpg erc.montana.edu]</ref> [[Hydrophobicity]] also plays an important role in determining the ability of bacteria to form biofilms, as those with increased hydrophobicity have reduced repulsion between the [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix]] and the bacterium.<ref>Donlan, Rodney M. 2002. Biofilms: Microbial Life on Surfaces. Emerging Infectious Diseases. Vol. 8, No. 9: pg. 881-890. </ref>
Some species are not able to attach to a surface on their own but are sometimes able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to earlier colonists. It is during this colonization that the cells are able to communicate via [[quorum sensing]] using products such as AHL. Some bacteria are unable to form biofilms as successfully due to their limited motility. Nonmotile bacteria cannot recognize the surface or aggregate together as easily as motile bacteria.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Once colonization has begun, the biofilm grows through a combination of cell division and recruitment. [[Polysaccharide]] matrices typically enclose bacterial biofilms. In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin.<ref>Ibid.</ref> The final stage of biofilm formation is known as dispersion, and is the stage in which the biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size. The development of a biofilm may allow for an aggregate cell colony (or colonies) to be increasingly antibiotic resistant.

==Development==
[[File:biofilm.jpg|thumb|300px|Five stages of biofilm development: (1) Initial attachment, (2) Irreversible attachment, (3) Maturation I, (4) Maturation II, and (5) Dispersion. Each stage of development in the diagram is paired with a photomicrograph of a developing ''P. aeruginosa'' biofilm. All photomicrographs are shown to same scale.]]
There are five stages of biofilm development (see illustration at right):
# ''Initial attachment'':
# ''Irreversible attachment'':
# ''Maturation I'':
# ''Maturation II'':
# ''Dispersion'':

==Dispersal==
Dispersal of cells from the biofilm colony is an essential stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|biofilm extracellular matrix]], such as [[dispersin B]] and [[deoxyribonuclease]], may play a role in biofilm dispersal.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Ramasubbu N, Fine DH |title=Detachment of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells by an endogenous beta-hexosaminidase activity |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=185 |issue=16 |pages=4693–8 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12896987 |pmc=166467 |doi=10.1128/JB.185.16.4693-4698.2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Izano EA, Amarante MA, Kher WB, Kaplan JB |title=Differential roles of poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide and extracellular DNA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=470–6 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18039822 |pmc=2223269 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02073-07}}</ref> Biofilm matrix degrading enzymes may be useful as anti-biofilm agents.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Velliyagounder K, Fine DH, Ramasubbu N |title=Enzymatic detachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=2633–6 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15215120 |pmc=434209 |doi=10.1128/AAC.48.7.2633-2636.2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Xavier JB, Picioreanu C, Rani SA, van Loosdrecht MC, Stewart PS |title=Biofilm-control strategies based on enzymic disruption of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix--a modelling study |journal=Microbiology |volume=151 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3817–32 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16339929 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.28165-0}}</ref> Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, [[cis-2-decenoic acid]], is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies.

==Properties==
Biofilms are usually found on solid [[Wiktionary:substrate|substrate]]s submerged in or exposed to an [[aqueous]] [[solution]], although they can form as floating mats on liquid surfaces and also on the surface of leaves, particularly in high humidity climates.  Given sufficient resources for growth, a biofilm will quickly grow to be macroscopic (visible to the naked eye).  Biofilms can contain many different types of microorganism, e.g. [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[protozoa]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]]; each group performs specialized [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions.  However, some organisms will form single-species films under certain conditions. The social structure (cooperation, competition) within a biofilm highly depends on the different species present.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nadell|first=Carey D.|coauthors=Xavier, Joao B.; Foster, Kevin R.|title=The sociobiology of biofilms|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|date=1 January 2009|volume=33|issue=1|pages=206–224|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00150.x}}</ref>

===Extracellular matrix===
The biofilm is held together and protected by a matrix of secreted [[polymer]]ic compounds called EPS.  EPS is an abbreviation for either [[extracellular polymeric substance]] or [[exopolysaccharide]].  This matrix protects the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals.  Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute [[nutrient]]s and signalling molecules.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Paul|coauthors=Dirk deBeer andZbigniew Lewandowski|title=Liquid Flow in Biofilm Systems|journal=Appl Environ Microbiol.|year=1994|month=August|volume=60|issue=8|pages=2711–2716}}</ref>  This matrix is strong enough that under certain conditions, biofilms can become [[fossil]]ized ([[Stromatolites]]).

Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways.
One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to [[detergent]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community.  In some cases antibiotic resistance can be increased a thousandfold.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Stewart PS, Costerton JW |title=Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9276 |pages=135–8 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11463434 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05321-1}}</ref> [[Lateral gene transfer]] is greatly facilitated in biofilms and leads to a more stable biofilm structure.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12849777 | doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(03)00036-3 | volume=14 | issue=3 | title=Gene transfer occurs with enhanced efficiency in biofilms and induces enhanced stabilisation of the biofilm structure | year=2003 | month=June | author=Molin S, Tolker-Nielsen T | journal=Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. | pages=255–61}}</ref>

However, biofilms are not always less susceptible to antibiotics.  For instance, the biofilm form of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the biofilm is compared to logarithmic phase planktonic cells, the biofilm does have greater resistance to antimicrobials.  This resistance to antibiotics in both stationary phase cells and biofilms may be due to the presence of [[persister cell]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Spoering AL, Lewis K |title=Biofilms and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have similar resistance to killing by antimicrobials |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=183 |issue=23 |pages=6746–51 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11698361 |pmc=95513 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.23.6746-6751.2001}}</ref>

==Examples==
[[File:Bacteria mats near Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|thumb|Biofilm in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Longest raised mat area is about half a meter long.]]
[[File:Thermophilic bacteria.jpg|thumb|Thermophilic bacteria in the outflow of [[Mickey Hot Springs]], [[Oregon]], approximately 20 mm thick.]]
Biofilms are ubiquitous.  Nearly every species of microorganism, not only bacteria and archaea, have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other.  Biofilms will form on virtually every non-shedding surface in a non-sterile aqueous (or very humid) environment.
* Biofilms can be found on rocks and pebbles at the bottom of most streams or [[river]]s and often form on the surface of [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pools of water.  In fact, biofilms are important components of [[food chains]] in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic [[invertebrate]]s upon which many fish feed.
* Biofilms can grow in the most extreme environments: from, for example, the extremely hot, briny waters of [[hot spring]]s ranging from very acidic to very alkaline, to frozen [[glacier]]s.
* In the human environment, biofilms can grow in [[shower]]s very easily since they provide a moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and sewage [[pipe (material)|pipes]] and cause clogging and [[corrosion]]. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas.
* Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to reduce heat transfer.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/01457638108939572 |title=Influence of Fouling Biofilms on Heat Transfer |year=1981 |last1=Characklis |first1=WG |last2=Nevimons |first2=MJ |last3=Picologlou |first3=BF |journal=Heat Transfer Engineering |volume=3 |pages=23 }}</ref>
* Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Schwermer CU, Lavik G, Abed RM, ''et al.'' |title=Impact of nitrate on the structure and function of bacterial biofilm communities in pipelines used for injection of seawater into oil fields |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=2841–51 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18344353 |pmc=2394879 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02027-07}}</ref> can lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that are attached to the metal subsurface (i.e., microbially influenced corrosion).
* Bacterial adhesion to boat hulls serves as the foundation for [[biofouling]] of seagoing vessels. Once a film of bacteria forms, it is easier for other marine organisms such as barnacles to attach. Such fouling can reduce maximum vessel speed by up to 20%, prolonging voyages and consuming fuel. Time in dry dock for refitting and repainting reduces the productivity of shipping assets, and the useful life of ships is also reduced due to corrosion and mechanical removal (scraping) of marine organisms from ships' hulls.
* Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many [[sewage treatment]] plants include a treatment stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter ([[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]), while [[protozoa]] and [[rotifer]]s are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. [[Slow sand filter]]s rely on biofilm development in the same way to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms.
* Biofilms can help eliminate [[petroleum]] oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems.  The oil is eliminated by the [[microbial biodegradation|hydrocarbon-degrading]] activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCB).<ref name=chapter9>{{Cite book|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=wx6v3TIkzXUC&pg=PA1971#v=onepage |author=Martins dos Santos VAP, Yakimov MM, Timmis KN, Golyshin PN |year=2008 |chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems |title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology |publisher=Horizon Scientific Press |editor=Díaz E|pages=1971 |isbn=978-1-904455-17-2}}</ref>
* [[Stromatolites]] are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial biofilms, especially of [[cyanobacteria]]. Stromatolites include some of the most ancient records of life on Earth, and are still forming today.
* Biofilms are present on the [[teeth]] of most animals as [[dental plaque]], where they may cause [[tooth decay]] and [[gum disease (disambiguation)|gum disease]].
* Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, as in the case of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots, exist symbiotically with the plant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm |title=Introduction to Biofilms: Desirable and undesirable impacts of biofilm}} (primary source)</ref> Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include Citrus Canker, [[Pierce's Disease]] of grapes, and Bacterial Spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Andersen PC, Brodbeck BV, Oden S, Shriner A, Leite B |title=Influence of xylem fluid chemistry on planktonic growth, biofilm formation and aggregation of Xylella fastidiosa |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |volume=274 |issue=2 |pages=210–7 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17610515 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00827.x}}</ref>

Research has shown that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics induce biofilm formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus''. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result from the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kaplan JB, Izano EA, Gopal P, ''et al.'' |title=Low Levels of B�-Lactam Antibiotics Induce Extracellular DNA Release and Biofilm Formation in Staphylococcus aureus |journal=mBio |volume=3 |issue=4|year=2012 |doi=10.1128/mBio.00198-12}}</ref>
