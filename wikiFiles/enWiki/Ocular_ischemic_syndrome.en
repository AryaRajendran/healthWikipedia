'''Ocular ischemic syndrome''' is the constellation of ocular [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptom]]s secondary to severe, chronic [[ischemia|arterial hypoperfusion]] to the [[human eye|eye]].<ref name="De Graeve">De Graeve C, Van de Sompel W, Claes C. [http://www.ophthalmologia.be/download.php?dof_id=25 "Ocular ischemic syndrome: two case reports of bilateral involvement."] ''Bull Soc Belge Ophtalmol.'' 1999;273:69-74. PMID 10546383.</ref> [[Amaurosis fugax]] is a form of acute [[vision loss]] caused by reduced blood flow to the eye that may be a warning sign of an impending [[stroke]]. Consequently, those with transient blurring of vision are advised to urgently seek medical attention for a thorough evaluation of the [[carotid artery]]. '''Anterior segment ischemic syndrome''' is a similar ischemic condition of [[anterior segment]] usually seen in post-surgical cases. '''Retinal arterial occlusion''' leads to rapid death of retinal cells, thereby resulting in severe loss of vision.

==Symptoms and signs==
Those with ocular ischemic syndrome are typically between the ages of 50 and 80;<ref>Friedberg MA, Rapuano CJ. ''The Wills Eye Manual: Office and Emergency Room Diagnosis and Treatment of Eye Disease'', J.B. Lippincott, 1994.</ref><ref name="REVO">[http://www.revoptom.com/handbook/SECT44a.HTM "Ocular Ischemic Syndrome."] Accessed October 25, 2006.</ref> twice as many men as women are affected.<ref name="REVO"/>  More than 90% of those presenting with the condition have [[vision loss]].<ref name="De Graeve"/> Patients may report a dull, radiating ache over the eye and [[eyebrow]].<ref name="De Graeve"/> Those with ocular ischemic syndrome may also present with a history of other systemic diseases including [[arterial hypertension]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[coronary artery disease]], previous [[stroke]], and [[hemodialysis]].<ref name="Chen">{{cite journal |author=Chen KJ, Chen SN, Kao LY, Ho CL, Chen TL, Lai CC, Wu SC. |title=Ocular ischemic syndrome |journal=Chang Gung Medical Journal |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=483–91 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11601190 }}</ref><ref name="Mizener">{{cite journal |author=Mizener JB, Podhajsky P, Hayreh SS |title=Ocular ischemic syndrome |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=104 |issue=5 |pages=859–64 |year=1997 |month=May |pmid=9160035 }}</ref>

The condition presents with visual loss secondary to hypoperfusion of the eye structures. The patient presents with intractable pain or ocular angina. On dilated examination, there may be blot retinal hemorrhages along with dilated and beaded retinal veins. The ocular perfusion pressure is decreased. 
The corneal layers show edema and striae. There is mild [[uveitis|anterior uveitis]]. A cherry-red spot in macula may be seen, along with cotton-wool spots elsewhere, due to retinal nerve fiber layer hemorrhages.  The retinal arteries may show spontaneous pulsations.

==Causes==
Severe ipsilateral or bilateral [[carotid artery stenosis]] or occlusion is the most common cause of ocular ischemic syndrome.<ref name="De Graeve"/> The syndrome has been associated with occlusion of the [[common carotid artery]], [[internal carotid artery]], and less frequently the [[external carotid artery]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alizai AM, Trobe JD, Thompson BG, Izer JD, Cornblath WT, Deveikis JP |title=Ocular ischemic syndrome after occlusion of both external carotid arteries |journal=Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=268–72 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16340491 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1070-8022&volume=25&issue=4&spage=268 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> Other causes include:
*[[Takayasu's arteritis]]<ref name="Koz">{{cite journal |author=Koz OG, Ates A, Numan Alp M, Gultan E, Karaaslan Y, Kural G |title=Bilateral ocular ischemic syndrome as an initial manifestation of Takayasu's arteritis associated with carotid steal syndrome |journal=Rheumatology International |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=299–302 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=16944156 |doi=10.1007/s00296-006-0194-4 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>
*[[Giant cell arteritis]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamed LM, Guy JR, Moster ML, Bosley T |title=Giant cell arteritis in the ocular ischemic syndrome |journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=702–5 |year=1992 |month=June |pmid=1598963 }}</ref>
*Severe [[ophthalmic artery]] occlusion, due to [[thromboembolism]].
*Surgical interruption of anterior ciliary blood vessels supplying the eye, particularly during extensive strabismus surgery on 3 or more [[extraocular muscle|rectus muscles]], leading to an '''anterior segment ischemic syndrome'''.

==Complications==
If carotid occlusive disease results in ophthalmic artery occlusion, general ocular ischemia may result in retinal neovascularization, rubeosis iridis, cells and flare, iris necrosis, and cataract. The condition leads to neovascularization in various eye tissues due to the ischemia. The eye pressure may become high due to associated [[neovascular glaucoma]]. An ischemic optic neuropathy may eventually occur.

==Treatment and management==
Quick determination of the cause may lead to urgent measures to save the eye and life of the patient. High clinical suspicion should be kept for painless vision loss in patients with [[atherosclerosis]], [[deep venous thrombosis]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[Pulmonary embolism|pulmonary thromboembolism]] or other previous embolic episodes. Those caused by a carotid artery [[embolism]] or occlusion have the potential for further stroke by detachment of embolus and migration to an end-artery of the brain.<ref name="pmid11336956">{{cite journal |author=Kaiboriboon K, Piriyawat P, Selhorst JB |title=Light-induced amaurosis fugax |journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=131 |issue=5 |pages=674–6 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11336956 |doi= 10.1016/S0002-9394(00)00874-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002939400008746 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> Hence, proper steps to prevent such an eventuality need to be taken. 

Retinal arterial occlusion is an ophthalmic emergency, and prompt treatment is essential. Completely anoxic retina in animal models causes irreversible damage in about 90 minutes. Nonspecific methods to increase blood flow and dislodge emboli include digital massage, 500&nbsp;mg [[Intravenous|IV]] [[acetazolamide]] and 100&nbsp;mg IV [[methylprednisolone]] (for possible arteritis). Additional measures include paracentesis of aqueous humor to decrease IOP acutely. An [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] should be drawn to detect possible giant cell arteritis. Improvement can be determined by visual acuity, [[visual field test]]ing, and by ophthalmoscopic examination. 

At a later stage, pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) with an argon laser appears effective in reducing the neovascular components and their sequelae.

The visual prognosis for ocular ischemic syndrome varies from usually poor to fair, depending on speed and effectiveness of the intervention.  However, prompt diagnosis is crucial as the condition may be a presenting sign of serious cerebrovascular and ischemic heart diseases.<ref name="Mizener"/>
