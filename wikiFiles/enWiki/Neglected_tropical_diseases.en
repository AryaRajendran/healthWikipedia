The '''neglected diseases''' are a group of [[tropical disease|tropical infections]] which are especially endemic in low-income populations in developing regions of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]].  Different organizations define the set of diseases differently.  In sub-Saharan Africa, the [[disease burden|impact of these diseases]] as a group is comparable to [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hotez PJ, Kamath A |title=Neglected Tropical Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa: Review of Their Prevalence, Distribution, and Disease Burden |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=e412 |year=2009 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000412 |pmid=19707588 |editor1-last=Cappello |editor1-first=Michael |pmc=2727001}}</ref>
Some of these diseases have known preventive measures or acute medical treatments which are available in the developed world but which are not universally available in poorer areas.  In some cases, the treatments are relatively inexpensive.  For example, the treatment for [[schistosomiasis]] is [[USD]] $0.20 per child per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7806977 |title=Making the Case to Fight Schistosomiasis|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> Nevertheless, control of neglected diseases is estimated to require funding of between US$2 billion to US$3 billion over the next five to seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-plan-to-defeat-neglected-tropical-diseases|title=How To Cure 1 Billion People? -- Defeat Neglected Tropical diseases|author= P.J.Hotez|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref> 

These diseases are contrasted with the big three diseases ([[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]]), which generally receive greater treatment and research funding. The neglected diseases can also make HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis more deadly.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=SciDev.Net|title=Beat neglected diseases to fight HIV, TB and malaria| author=Mike Shanahan|date=31 January 2006 |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2629&language=1}}</ref> 
However, some pharmaceutical companies have committed to donating all the drug therapies required and mass drug administration has been successfully accomplished in several countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reddy M, Gill SS, Kalkar SR, Wu W, Anderson PJ, Rochon PA |title=Oral drug therapy for multiple neglected tropical diseases: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=16 |pages=1911–24 |month=October |year=2007 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.16.1911 |pmid=17954542}}</ref>

==List of diseases==

Neglected tropical diseases include in order of decreasing prevalence:<ref>World Health Organization, apud Reddy M et al.:{{cite web|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/298/16/1911/T1.large.jpg|title= Key Features of 13 Neglected Tropical Diseases Listed by Prevalence - 2007|publisher=The Journal of the American Medical Association|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>  
*Soil transmitted helminths, including:
**[[roundworm]]s such as  ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'' which causes  [[ascariasis]];
**[[whipworm]] which causes [[trichuriasis]];
** [[hookworm]]s which, depending on the species, cause [[necatoriasis]] and [[ancylostomiasis]].
*Snail fever ([[schistosomiasis]])
*Elephantiasis ([[Lymphatic filariasis]])
*[[Trachoma]]
*River blindness ([[onchocerciasis]])
* Kala-azar black fever (and other clinical forms of [[leishmaniasis]])
*[[Chagas disease]] (American trypanosomiasis)
*[[Leprosy]]
*[[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]] (Human [[African Trypanosomiasis]])
*[[Guinea-worm]] ([[dracunculiasis]])
*[[Buruli ulcer]]

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) list of neglected tropical diseases also adds the following additional diseases: [[Cysticercosis]],  [[Dengue]]/[[dengue haemorrhagic fever]], [[Echinococcosis]], [[Fascioliasis]], [[Rabies]], [[Yaws]]; and includes two other 'neglected' conditions’: [[Podoconiosis]] (also known as [[elephantiasis]]) and [[Snakebite]].<ref>World Health Organisation: Diseases covered by NTD Department. http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/</ref>

===Trypanosomal parasites===
*[[Kala-azar]] (visceral leishmaniasis, a severe form of [[leishmaniasis]]) - Treatments exist, most of them costly and/or toxic. Resistance to [[pentavalent antimonial]]s is spreading in parts of [[India]]. Disease is fatal if untreated. [[Vaccine]]s are under development as of 2006. Infection is spread by the bite of [[Phlebotomus|sandflies]].
*[[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]] (African trypanosomiasis) - In 2009, the reported number of new cases of this disease fell below 10,000 for the first time in 50 years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/integrated_media/integrated_media_hat_june_2010/en/index.html | title=Human African Trypanosomiasis: number of new cases falls to historical low in 50 years | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Treatments exist, but have not changed much since colonial times due to lack of further research. The current forms of treatment are ineffective, highly toxic and resistance is spreading.  This disease is always fatal if untreated but the outcome is often the same with the existing treatment.  Infection is spread by the bite of the tsetse fly.
*[[Chagas disease]] (American trypanosomiasis) - No vaccine exists for Chagas disease.  Treatment for early infection exists but is uneconomical and not authorized as such, current drugs have severe side effects.  Chagas disease does not kill victims rapidly, instead causing years of debilitating chronic symptoms. Bites from South American [[assassin bug]]s allow the disease to spread.

===Worm (helminth) parasites===
*[[Schistosomiasis]] - Inexpensive [[praziquantel]] can treat this disease, but cannot prevent reinfection.  Other treatments are harder to obtain in the developing world. Multiple vaccines are under development.  ''[[Schistosoma]]'' species have a complex life cycle that alternates between humans and freshwater snails; infection occurs upon contact with contaminated water. This disease is unique in that damage is not caused by the worms themselves, but rather by the large volume of eggs that the worms produce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/schistosomiasis/factsht_schistosomiasis.htm|publisher=CDC, Division of Parasitic Diseases |title=Schistosomiasis Fact Sheet|accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref>
*Lymphatic [[Filariasis]] (causes [[elephantiasis]]) - Effective antihelminthic treatments have been widely used in a cost-effective manner <ref>{{cite journal|author=Mohammed KA, Hail HJ, Gabrielli AF. et al.|title=Triple Co-Administration of Ivermectin, Albendazole and Praziquantel in Zanzibar: A Safety Study|journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |volume=2 | issue=1 | year=2008 | doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000171|editor1-last=Utzinger|editor1-first=Juerg|pages=e171|pmid=18235853|pmc=2217668}}</ref>
*[[Onchocerciasis]] (river blindness) - Antihelminthic treatment exists, prevention may also involve insect control.
*[[Drancunculiasis]] (guinea worm) - Preventable by water filtration, case containment, and increased access to safe water.  An [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] program has been under way since 1989.  So far, annual cases have been reduced from ~3,500,000 in 1986 to 3,190 in 2009,<ref name="WHO_WER_85-19">{{Cite document |author=World Health Organisation | title=Weekly Epidemiology Record 85, no 19, p. 166: Dracunculiasis eradication - global surveillance summary, 2009 |url=http://www.who.int/entity/wer/2010/wer8519.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-14 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> and the disease has been eliminated in all but 5 countries worldwide.<ref name="Wrap-up 202">{{cite web | title=Guinea Worm Wrap-Up 202 | url=http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/202.pdf | publisher=Carter Center | accessdate=2011-01-20 | format=PDF}}</ref>

====Soil-transmitted helminthiases====
{{Main|Soil-transmitted helminthiasis}}
*[[Ascariasis]] ([[roundworm]]) - Antihelminthic treatments exist, prevention involves food and sewage sanitation
*[[Trichuriasis]] ([[whipworm]]) - Antihelminthic treatments exist, prevention involves food and sewage sanitation
*[[Hookworm]] - Antihelminthic treatments exist, prevention involves food and sewage sanitation
*[[Strongyloidiasis]] - Antihelminthic treatments exist, prevention involves sewage sanitation and prevention of malnutrition

===Bacterial infections===
*[[Leprosy]] - Antibiotic treatments exist which can clear the infection; [[Bacille Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] vaccine has some preventative effect.
*[[Buruli ulcer]] - Surgical and antibiotic interventions are recommended
*[[Noma (disease)|Noma]] - Antibiotics in early phase prevents spreading of Noma. After 2–3 weeks, surgical interventions become necessary.
*[[Trachoma]] - Antibiotic treatments exist, prevention involves interpersonal hygiene
*[[Cholera]] - Cholera is caused by ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' bacteria living in contaminated drinking water.  The disease presents with severe, watery diarrhea after a short incubation period lasting from zero to five days.  Cholera is especially dangerous because it can kill patients in less than 24 hours from rapid dehydration.  Antibacterial treatments can cure the disease, but most effective is isotonic fluid replacement therapy, which reduces deaths to 1% of cases.  Cholera can be prevented with limited efficacy by two oral vaccines, but access to clean drinking water provides a guarantee of prevention.

===Viral infections===
*[[Yellow fever]] - A vaccine exists for Yellow fever.  Yellow fever, like some other neglected diseases, is caused by a [[flavivirus]].  It is not generally transmissible between humans except presumably through fluid transfer, so patient isolation is not required.  In a minority of cases it is hemorrhagic.  Thus, due to increased tendency to bleed, and possible blood in the vomitus, standard precautions for caregivers (like gloves and washing with soap) should be applied.
*[[Dengue fever]] - Dengue fever is also caused by a flavivirus, and is spread by the bite of the ''A. Aegypti'' mosquito.  Dengue fever is not usually fatal, but infection with one of four serotypes can increase later susceptibility to other serotypes, resulting in the highly dangerous Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).  No treatment for either type of disease exists beyond [[palliative care]].
*[[Japanese Encephalitis]] - A vaccine exists for Japanese Encephalitis.  Japanese Encephalitis is caused by a flavivirus.  The disease is spread by ''[[Culex tritaeniorhynchus]]'' mosquitoes.  It is not transmissible between humans, except presumably through fluid transfer, so patient isolation is not required.

==Cost-effectiveness of treatment==
Lack of intervention makes treating neglected diseases a priority, though efforts to do so are chronically underfunded. There are currently only two donor-fundable charities that focus exclusively on NTDs:<ref name = "Giving What We Can; recommended interventions">
{{cite web | title = Giving What We Can; recommended interventions | url = http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities#sci}}</ref>
the [[Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]] and Deworm the World. Despite the lack of funding, neglected diseases are very cheap to treat and prevent. The cost of treating a child for infection of soil transmitted helminths and schistosomes (some of the main causes of neglected diseases, as listed above), is less than US $0.50 per year, when administered as part of mass school-based deworming by Deworm the World. This programme is recommended by [[Giving What We Can]] and the [[Copenhagen Consensus|Copenhagen Consensus Centre]] as one of the most efficient and cost-effective solutions available for such issues.<ref name="Copenhagen consensus">
{{cite web | title = Copenhagen consensus; outcome | url = http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/Copenhagen%20Consensus%202008/Outcome.aspx}}</ref>
The long term benefits of these interventions include a decrease in school absenteeism by 25%, and an increase in adult earnings by 20%.<ref name="Deworm the World">
{{cite web | title = Deworm the World: the evidence for school-based deworming | url = http://www.dewormtheworld.org/why-deworm/the-evidence-for-school-based-deworming}}</ref>
The efforts of [[Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]] to combat neglected diseases include the use of rapid impact packages; supplying schools with packages including four or five drugs,  and training teachers in how to administer them. This is so cheap and effective that it has often been called the 'best buy in public health'.

==Incentives for research and development==
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] [[priority review voucher]] is an incentive for companies to invest in new drugs and vaccines for tropical diseases. A provision of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (HR 3580) awards a transferable “priority review voucher” to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for one of the listed diseases.  The voucher can later be used to accelerate review of an unrelated drug.  This program is for all tropical diseases and includes medicines for malaria and tuberculosis.  The first voucher given was for [[Coartem]], a malaria treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm149559.htm|title=FDA Approves Coartem Tablets to Treat Malaria|accessdate=11 December 2009|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|USFDA]]}}</ref>  It does not use or define the term "neglected" though most of the diseases listed are often included on lists of neglected diseases.

The prize was proposed by [[Duke University]] faculty Henry Grabowski, Jeffrey Moe, and David Ridley in their 2006 ''Health Affairs'' paper: "Developing Drugs for Developing Countries."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ridley DB, Grabowski HG, Moe JL |title=Developing drugs for developing countries |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313–24 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.313 |pmid=16522573 |year=2006}}</ref>  In 2007 United States Senators [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) and [[Sherrod Brown]] (D-OH) sponsored an amendment to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] Amendments Act of 2007. President [[George W. Bush]] signed the bill in September 2007.

Biotechnology companies in the developing world have targeted neglected tropical diseases due to need to improve global health.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frew SE, Liu VY, Singer PA |title=A business plan to help the 'global South' in its fight against neglected diseases |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1760–73 |year=2009 |pmid=19887417 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.6.1760 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079975330/Peter_Singer_Neglected_Tropical_Diseases.pdf}}</ref>
