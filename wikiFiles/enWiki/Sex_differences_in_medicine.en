'''Sex differences in medicine''' include sex-specific diseases, which are [[disease]]s that occur ''only'' in people of one [[sex]]; and sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more common to one sex, or which manifest differently in each sex.  For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in  men. Gender-based medicine, also called "gender medicine", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients. More recently, medical research has started to understand the importance of taking the sex in to count as the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.columbia-stmarys.org/19301.cfm |title= Women, Men, and Medicine: We're Not Equal |author=Cuozzo, Karen; Bratman, Steven (reviewer)|publisher=EBSCO Publishing |date=2005, September (last reviewed)}}</ref>

Neither concept should be confused with [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, which are diseases that have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact.

Sex-related illnesses have various causes:
* [[Sex-linked]] genetic illnesses
* Parts of the [[reproductive system]] that are specific to one sex
* Social causes that relate to the [[gender role]] expected of that sex in a particular society.
* Different levels of prevention, reporting, diagnosis or treatment in each gender.

==Women==
Examples of sex-related illnesses in female humans:

* 99% of [[breast cancer]] occurs in [[women]].
* [[Ovarian cancer]], and other diseases of the female reproductive system occur only in women. [[Endometriosis]], another female reproductive disorder occurs almost exclusively in women, but has rarely been found in men undergoing estrogen treatment for prostate cancer.
* More women than men suffer from [[osteoporosis]]
* [[Autoimmune diseases]], such as [[Sjögren's syndrome]] and [[scleroderma]], are more prevalent in women. An estimated 75 percent of those living with autoimmune diseases are female.<ref name=McCoy>[http://www.everydayhealth.com/autoimmune-disorders/understanding/women-and-autoimmune-diseases.aspx Everyday Health > Women and Autoimmune Disorders] By Krisha McCoy.

* In Western cultures, more women than men suffer from [[eating disorder]]s such as [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]]
* [[Alzheimer's disease]] has a higher rate in women than in men.<ref>[http://www.cmellc.com/geriatrictimes/g011123.html Gender Differences in Alzheimer's Disease] by Brian R. Ott, M.D., and Deborah A. Cahn-Weiner, Ph.D.. Geriatric Times. November/December 2001. Vol. II. Issue 6</ref>
* Women are more likely to suffer from unipolar [[clinical depression]] (although [[bipolar disorder]] appears to affect both sexes equally)
* Psychologists are more likely to diagnose women than men with [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] or [[histrionic personality disorder]] [citation needed]. There is no current agreement on whether this is because of a real underlying difference between the sexes, or simply because of deeply ingrained social attitudes [citation needed].

==Men==
Examples of sex-related illnesses in male humans:

* [[Prostate cancer]] and other diseases of the male reproductive system occur only in [[men]].
* Diseases of [[X-linked recessive inheritance]], such as [[color blindness|colour blindness]], occur more frequently in men. 
* [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm]]s are six times more common in men, and thus some countries have introduce screening for males at risk of suffering the condition.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7172094.stm</ref>
* [[Autism]] is approximately 4 times more prevalent in males than females.<ref name=Newschaffer>{{vcite journal |author=Newschaffer CJ, Croen LA, Daniels J ''et al.'' |author.= |title=The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |year=2007 |volume=28 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17367287 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144007 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref>
* Psychologists are more likely to diagnose men than women with [[antisocial personality disorder]] and substance-abuse disorders [citation needed].
