'''Rabies''' ({{IPA-en|ˈreɪbiːz|pron}}. From {{lang-la|rabies}}, "madness") is a [[Virus|viral]] disease that causes acute [[encephalitis]] in [[warm-blooded]] animals.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Drew WL | chapter= Chapter 41: Rabies | editors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages=597–600 | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> The disease is [[zoonotic]], meaning it can be transmitted from one species to another, such as from dogs to humans, commonly by a bite from an infected animal. For a human, rabies is almost invariably fatal if postexposure [[prophylaxis]] is not administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death.

The [[rabies virus]] travels to the brain by following the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]]. The [[incubation period]] of the disease is usually a few months in humans, depending on the distance the virus must travel to reach the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book |author=Cotran RS |title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=St. Louis |year=2005 |page=1375 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |author-separator=, |author2=Kumar V |author3=Fausto N |display-authors=3}}</ref> Once the rabies virus reaches the central nervous system and symptoms begin to show, the infection is virtually untreatable and usually fatal within days.

Early-stage symptoms of rabies are [[malaise]], [[headache]] and [[fever]], progressing to acute [[pain]], violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and hydrophobia.<ref name=Sherris/> Finally, the patient may experience periods of [[mania]] and [[lethargy]], eventually leading to [[coma]].

==Signs and symptoms==
{{confusing|section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Rabies patient.jpg|right|thumb|Patient with rabies, 1959]] 
The period between infection and the first [[flu-like symptoms]] is typically 2 to 12 weeks, but incubation periods as short as four days and longer than six years have been documented, depending on the location and severity of the inoculating wound and the amount of virus introduced. Soon after, the symptoms expand to slight or partial [[paralysis]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[confusion]], [[wikt:restlessness|agitation]], abnormal behavior, [[paranoia]], terror, and [[hallucination]]s, progressing to [[delirium]].<ref name=Robbins/><ref>{{cite web | author=Schoenstadt A | date=2008-07-21 | accessdate=2010-01-30 | url= http://rabies.emedtv.com/rabies/rabies-symptoms.html | title=Rabies Symptoms | publisher=eMedTV}}</ref> Rabies has been called hydrophobia because victims, locally paralyzed and unable to swallow, have been known to become agitated at the sight of water.<ref>{{cite web |author=LA Veterinary Health | date=2011-12-20T12:15:27 |accessdate=2012-05-24 |url=http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/rabiesmanual/clinical.htm |title= Rabies Control Manual |publisher=Los Angeles County Department of Public Health}}</ref>{{clarification needed|reason=Do these symptoms occur in all mammals, or do they only occur in humans?|date=March 2013}}

==Virology==
{{confusing|section|date=May 2013}}
{{Main|Rabies virus}}
[[File:Rabies Virus EM PHIL 1876.JPG|thumb|[[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] [[micrograph]] with numerous rabies [[virion]]s (small, dark grey, rodlike particles) and [[Negri bodies]] (the larger [[pathognomonic]] cellular inclusions of rabies infection)]]

The rabies virus is the [[type species]] of the [[Lyssavirus]] [[genus]], in the family'' [[Rhabdoviridae]]'', order ''[[Mononegavirales]]''. Lyssaviruses have helical symmetry, with a length of about 180&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] and a cross-section of about 75&nbsp;nm.<ref name=Sherris/> These viruses are [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] and have a single-stranded [[RNA]] genome with [[negative-sense#Negative-sense|negative sense]]. The genetic information is packed as a [[ribonucleoprotein]] complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein. The [[RNA genome]] of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and the viral RNA polymerase (L).<ref name="pmid15885837">{{cite journal |author=Finke S, Conzelmann KK |title=Replication strategies of rabies virus |journal=Virus Res. |volume=111 |issue=2 |pages=120–31 |year=2005 |month=August|pmid=15885837 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2005.04.004 |url=}}</ref>

Once within a muscle or nerve cell, the virus undergoes replication. The trimeric spikes on the exterior of the membrane of the virus interact with a specific cell receptor, the most likely one being the acetylcholine receptor. The cellular membrane pinches in a procession known as [[pinocytosis]] and allows entry of the virus into the cell by way of an endosome. The virus then uses the acidic environment of that endosome and binds to its membrane simultaneously, releasing its five proteins and single strand RNA into the cytoplasm.<ref name=CDC_Rabies_PEP />

The L protein then transcribes five mRNA strands and a positive strand of RNA all from the original negative strand RNA using free nucleotides in the cytoplasm. These five mRNA strands are then translated into their corresponding proteins (P, L, N, G and M proteins) at free ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Some proteins require post-translative modifications. For example, the G protein travels through the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where it undergoes further folding, and is then transported to the [[Golgi apparatus]], where a sugar group is added to it ([[glycosylation]]).<ref name=CDC_Rabies_PEP />

Where there are enough proteins, the viral polymerase will begin to synthesize new negative strands of RNA from the template of the positive strand RNA. These negative strands will then form complexes with the N, P, L and M proteins and then travel to the inner membrane of the cell, where a G protein has embedded itself in the membrane. The G protein then coils around the N-P-L-M complex of proteins taking some of the host cell membrane with it, which will form the new outer envelope of the virus particle. The virus then buds from the cell.<ref name=CDC_Rabies_PEP />

From the point of entry, the virus is [[neurotropic virus|neurotropic]], traveling quickly along the neural pathways into the [[central nervous system]], and then to other organs.<ref name=Robbins/> The [[salivary glands]] receive high concentrations of the virus, thus allowing further transmission.

==Diagnosis==
Rabies can be difficult to diagnose, as in the early stages it is easily confused with other diseases or aggressiveness.<ref name=Merck>{{cite book|title=The Merck Veterinary Manual|year=2010|publisher=Courier Kendallville, Inc|location=Kendallville, Indiana|isbn=0-911910-93-X|page=1193|edition=10th|editor=Cynthia M. Kahn, BA, MA|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> The [[Gold standard (test)|reference method]] for diagnosing rabies is by performing [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] or [[cell culture#Viral culture methods|viral culture]] on brain samples taken after death.

The [[differential diagnosis]] in a case of suspected human rabies may initially include any cause of [[encephalitis]], in particular infection with viruses such as [[herpesviridae|herpesviruses]], [[enteroviruses]], and [[arboviruses]] such as [[West Nile virus]]. The most important viruses to rule out are [[herpes simplex virus]] type one, [[varicella zoster virus]], and (less commonly) enteroviruses, including [[coxsackie virus|coxsackievirus]]es, [[echovirus]]es, [[poliovirus]]es, and human [[enterovirus]]es 68 to 71.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/220967-diagnosis |title=Rabies: Differential Diagnoses & Workup |work= eMedicine Infectious Diseases | date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref>

New causes of viral encephalitis are also possible, as was evidenced by the 1999 outbreak in Malaysia of 300 cases of encephalitis with a mortality rate of 40% caused by [[Nipah virus]], a newly recognized [[paramyxovirus]].<ref name="refDiseasesOfSwine">{{cite book |author=Taylor DH, Straw BE, Zimmerman JL, D'Allaire S |title=Diseases of swine |publisher=Blackwell publishing |location=Oxford |year=2006 |pages=463–5 |isbn=0-8138-1703-X |url=http://books.google.com/?id=3o9l77HdZkgC&lpg=PA455&vq=nipah&dq=diseases%20of%20swine&pg=PA463#v=snippet&q=nipah |accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> Likewise, well-known viruses may be introduced into new locales, as is illustrated by the recent outbreak of encephalitis due to West Nile virus in the eastern United States.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inflammatory Disorders Of The Nervous System: Pathogenesis, Immunology, and Clinical Management |last=Minagar |first=Alireza |coauthors=J.

Cheaper rabies diagnosis will become possible for low-income settings: accurate rabies diagnosis can be done at a tenth of the cost of traditional testing using basic [[Light microscopy#Optical microscopy|light microscopy]] techniques.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dürr | first1 = S | last2 = Naïssengar | first2 = S | last3 = Mindekem | first3 = R | last4 = Diguimbye | first4 = C | last5 = Niezgoda | first5 = M | last6 = Kuzmin | first6 = I | last7 = Rupprecht | first7 = CE | last8 = Zinsstag | first8 = J |title=Rabies diagnosis for developing countries |journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases |volume=2 |issue=3 |id=e206 |year=2008 |pmid=18365035 |pmc=2268742 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000206 |url=http://www.plosntds.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000206&representation=PDF | format = PDF | editor1-last = Cleaveland | editor1-first = Sarah | pages = e206 }}</ref>

==Prevention==
{{Main|Rabies vaccine}}
All human cases of rabies were fatal until a vaccine was developed in 1885 by [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Émile Roux]]. Their original vaccine was harvested from infected rabbits, from which the virus in the nerve tissue was weakened by allowing it to dry for five to 10 days.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Geison GL |title=Pasteur's work on rabies: Reexamining the ethical issues |journal=Hastings Center Report |volume=8 |issue=2 | month=April |pages=26–33 |year=1978 |jstor=3560403 |doi=10.2307/3560403 |pmid=348641}}</ref> Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used in some countries, as they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines.<ref name="pmid15069272">{{cite journal|author=Srivastava AK, Sardana V, Prasad K, Behari M |title=Diagnostic dilemma in flaccid paralysis following anti-rabies vaccine |journal=Neurol India |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=132–3 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15069272 |url=http://www.neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2004;volume=52;issue=1;spage=132;epage=133;aulast=Srivastava}}</ref> 

The human [[diploid]] cell rabies vaccine was started in 1967; a new and less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine and purified [[vero cell]] rabies vaccine are now available.<ref name="Ly2009"/> A [[recombinant vaccine]] called V-RG has been successfully used in Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States to prevent outbreaks of rabies in undomesticated animals.<ref name="Reece_2006">{{cite journal | doi=10.1136/vr.159.12.379 | author=Reece JF, Chawla SK. | title=Control of rabies in Jaipur, India, by the sterilisation and vaccination of neighbourhood dogs |journal=Vet Rec | year=2006 | volume=159 | pages=379–83 |pmid=16980523 | issue=12 }}</ref> Currently, immunization prior to exposure has been used in both human and nonhuman populations, where, as in many jurisdictions, domesticated animals are required to be vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web | title = Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control | date=2007-12-31 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | publisher=National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians | url=http://www.nasphv.org/Documents/RabiesCompendium.pdf}}</ref>

In the United States, since the widespread vaccination of domestic dogs and cats and the development of effective human vaccines and immunoglobulin treatments, the number of recorded human deaths from rabies has dropped from 100 or more annually in the early 20th century to one to two per year, mostly caused by bat bites, which may go unnoted by the victim and hence untreated.<ref name="CDC_Rabies_Epi"/>

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Communicable Disease Surveillance 2007 Annual Report states the following can help reduce the risk of contracting rabies:<ref>{{cite report|date=2007|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.dhss.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/communicabledisease/annual07/Annual07.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>

* Vaccinating dogs, cats, rabbits, and ferrets against rabies
* Keeping pets under supervision
* Not handling wild animals or strays
* Contacting an animal control officer upon observing a wild animal or a stray, especially if the animal is acting strangely
* If bitten by an animal, washing the wound with soap and water for 10 to 15 minutes and contacting a healthcare provider to determine if post-exposure prophylaxis is required

September 28 is [[World Rabies Day]], which promotes the information, prevention, and elimination of the disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/annual/world_rabies_day/en/ |title=World Rabies Day | publisher = World Health Organization (WHO) }}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Main|Postexposure prophylaxis}}
[[postexposure prophylaxis|Treatment after exposure]] is highly successful in preventing the disease if administered promptly, in general within 10 days of infection.<ref name=Sherris/> Thoroughly washing the wound as soon as possible with soap and water for approximately five minutes is very effective in reducing the number of viral particles. "If available, a virucidal antiseptic such as povidone-iodine, [[Tincture of iodine|iodine tincture]], aqueous iodine solution, or alcohol (ethanol) should be applied after washing. Exposed mucous membranes such as eyes, nose or mouth should be flushed well with water."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/ideas/bluebook/rabies_info |title=Rabies & Australian bat lyssavirus information sheet |publisher=Health.vic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref>

In the US, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends patients receive one dose of human rabies [[immunoglobulin]] (HRIG) and four doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5902.pdf "Use of a Reduced (4-Dose) Vaccine Schedule for Postexposure Prophylaxis to Prevent Human Rabies"]. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).</ref> The immunoglobulin dose should not exceed 20 units per kilogram body weight. HRIG is expensive and constitutes the vast majority of the cost of postexposure treatment, ranging as high as several thousand dollars. As much as possible of this dose should be infiltrated around the bites, with the remainder being given by deep intramuscular injection at a site distant from the vaccination site.<ref name="CDC_Rabies_PEP">{{cite web | url= http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/postexposure.html | title= Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) | date=2009-12-23 | accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> 

The first dose of rabies vaccine is given as soon as possible after exposure, with additional doses on days three, seven and 14 after the first. Patients who have previously received pre-exposure vaccination do not receive the immunoglobulin, only the postexposure vaccinations on days 0 and 2.

Modern cell-based vaccines are similar to flu shots in terms of pain and side effects. The old nerve-tissue-based vaccinations that require multiple painful injections into the abdomen with a large needle are inexpensive, but are being phased out and replaced by affordable World Health Organization intradermal vaccination regimens.<ref name="Ly2009"/>

Intramuscular vaccination should be given into the deltoid, not gluteal area, which has been associated with vaccination failure due to injection into fat rather than muscle.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In infants, the lateral thigh is used as for routine childhood vaccinations.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Awakening to find a bat in the room, or finding a bat in the room of a previously unattended child or mentally disabled or intoxicated person, is regarded as an indication for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The recommendation for the precautionary use of PEP in occult bat encounters where no contact is recognized has been questioned in the medical literature, based on a cost-benefit analysis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=de Serres G|title=Bats in the bedroom, bats in the belfry: Reanalysis of the rationale for rabies postexposure prophylaxis|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2009|volume=48|issue=11|pmid=19400689|pages=1493–9|doi=10.1086/598998|author-separator=,|author2=Skowronski DM|author3=Mimault P|display-authors=3|last4=Ouakki|first4=Manale|last5=Maranda‐Aubut|first5=Renée|last6=Duval|first6=Bernard}}</ref> However, a 2002 study has supported the protocol of precautionary administering of PEP where a child or mentally compromised individual has been alone with a bat, especially in sleep areas, where a bite or exposure may occur without the victim being aware.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Despond O, Tucci M, Decaluwe H, Grégoire MC, S Teitelbaum J, Turgeon N |title=Rabies in a nine-year-old child: The myth of the bite |journal=Can J Infect Dis |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=121–5 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=18159381 |pmc=2094861 }}</ref></blockquote> Begun with little or no delay, PEP is 100% effective against rabies.<ref name="Lite2009"/> In the case in which there has been a significant delay in administering PEP, the treatment should be administered regardless, as it may still be effective.<ref name="CDC_Rabies_PEP"/>

In 2004, American teenager Jeanna Giese survived an infection of rabies unvaccinated. She was placed into an [[induced coma]] upon onset of symptoms and given [[ketamine]], [[midazolam]], [[ribavirin]], and [[amantadine]]. Her doctors administered treatment based on the hypothesis that detrimental effects of rabies were caused by temporary dysfunctions in the brain and could be avoided by inducing a temporary partial halt in brain function that would protect the brain from damage while giving the immune system time to defeat the virus.

Treatment after exposure (receiving the vaccines), PEP, is highly successful in preventing the disease if administered promptly, in general within 6 days of infection. Begun with little or no delay, PEP is 100% effective against rabies.<ref name="Lite2009"/> In the case of significant delay in administering PEP, the treatment still has a chance of success.<ref name="CDC_Rabies_PEP"/>

In unvaccinated humans, rabies is usually fatal after [[neurological]] symptoms have developed, but prompt postexposure [[vaccination]] may prevent the virus from progressing. Rabies kills around 55,000 people a year, mostly in Asia and Africa.<ref name="WHO factsheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/|title=Rabies|date=September 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |accessdate=31 December 2011 }}</ref>

Rabies may also spread through exposure to infected [[livestock|domestic farm animals]], [[groundhog]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raccoons]], [[skunks]] and other [[Carnivora|wild carnivores]]. Small rodents, such as squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, and mice, and [[lagomorphs]], such as rabbits and hares, are almost never found to be infected with rabies and are not known to transmit rabies to humans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/other.html | title=Rabies.

===Prevalence===
{{Main|Prevalence of rabies}}
The rabies virus survives in widespread, varied, rural fauna reservoirs. It is present in the animal populations of almost every country in the world, except in Australia and New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.who.int/rabies/rabies_maps/en/index.html "Essential rabies maps"]. World Health Organization (WHO).</ref> [[Australian bat lyssavirus]] (ABLV) discovered in 1996 is similar to rabies, and is believed to be prevalent in native bat populations. In some countries, such as those in western Europe and Oceania, rabies is considered to be prevalent among bat populations only.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In Asia, parts of the Americas, and large parts of Africa, dogs remain the principal host. Mandatory vaccination of animals is less effective in rural areas. Especially in developing countries, pets may not be privately kept and their destruction may be unacceptable. Oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, a practice that has successfully reduced rabies in rural areas of [[Canada]], [[France]], and the [[United States]]. In [[Montréal]], Canada, baits are successfully used on raccoons in the Mont-Royal Park area. Vaccination campaigns may be expensive, and cost-benefit analysis suggests baits may be a cost-effective method of control.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meltzer MI|title=Assessing the costs and benefits of an oral vaccine for raccoon rabies: a possible model|journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=343–9|date=October–December 1996 |pmc=2639934 |pmid=8969251 |doi=10.3201/eid0204.960411}}</ref> In [[Ontario]], a dramatic drop in rabies was recorded when an aerial bait-vaccination campaign was launched.<ref name=Grambo>{{cite book|last=Grambo|first=Rebecca L|title=The World of the Fox|year=1995|publisher=Greystone Books|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-87156-377-0|page=94-5}}</ref>

Dog bite victims with PPS (both male and female) become convinced that puppies are growing inside them, and often seek help from faith healers, rather than from conventional medical services. In cases where the bite was from a rabid dog, this decision can prove fatal. Dr. Nitai Kishore Marik, former district medical officer of West Midnapur, states "I have seen scores of cases of rabies that reached our hospitals very late because of the intervention of faith healers. We could not save those lives."<ref>http://www.dw.de/medicine-challenges-indian-superstition/a-16489334</ref> 20,000 people are estimated to die every year from rabies in India — more than a third of the global toll.<ref name="harris"/>  {{As of|2007}}, Vietnam had the second-highest rate, followed by Thailand; in these countries, the virus is primarily transmitted through canines (feral dogs and other wild canine species).<ref name="biomed">{{cite journal |author=Denduangboripant J, Wacharapluesadee S, Lumlertdacha B, Ruankaew N, Hoonsuwan W, Puanghat A, Hemachudha T |title=Transmission dynamics of rabies virus in Thailand: Implications for disease control |journal=BMC Infect Dis |volume=5 |id=52 |month = June |year = 2005 |pmid=15985183 |pmc=1184074

Rabies is common among wild animals in the US. [[Bat]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[skunk]]s and [[fox]]es account for almost all reported cases (98% in 2009). Rabid bats are found in all 48 contiguous states. Other reservoirs are more limited geographically; for example, the raccoon rabies virus variant is only found in a relatively narrow band along the East Coast. Due to a high public awareness of the virus, efforts at vaccination of domestic animals and curtailment of feral populations, and availability of [[postexposure prophylaxis]], incidents of rabies in humans are very rare. A total of 49 cases of the disease were reported in the country in 1995-2011; of these, 11 are thought to have been acquired abroad. Almost all domestically acquired cases are attributed to bat bites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/index.html|title=Rabies Surveillance Data in the United States | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] }}</ref>

In [[Switzerland]], the disease has been virtually eradicated after scientists placed chicken heads laced with live attenuated vaccine in the [[Swiss Alps]].<ref name="Grambo"/> The foxes of Switzerland, proved to be the main source of rabies in the country, ate the chicken heads and immunized themselves.<ref name="Grambo"/>

==History==
===Etymology===
[[File:Middle Ages rabid dog.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[woodcut]] from the [[Middle Ages]] showing a rabid dog.]]

===Impact===
Because of its potentially violent nature, rabies has been known since ''circa'' 2000 B.C.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adamson PB |title=The spread of rabies into Europe and the probable origin of this disease in antiquity |journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=2 |pages=140–4 |year=1977 |pmid=11632333 | jstor = 25210880 |issue=2 |doi=10.1017/S0035869X00133829 }}</ref> The first written record of rabies is in the Mesopotamian [[Laws of Eshnunna|Codex of Eshnunna]] (circa 1930 BC), which dictates that the owner of a dog showing symptoms of rabies should take preventive measure against bites. If another person were<!--subjunctive--> bitten by a rabid dog and later died, the owner was heavily fined.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dunlop | first = Robert H | coauthors = Williams, David J | title = Veterinary Medicine: An Illustrated History | publisher = Mosby | year= 1996 | isbn=0-8016-3209-9 }}</ref>

Rabies was considered a scourge for its prevalence in the 19th century. In France and Belgium, where [[Hubertus|Saint Hubert]] was venerated, the "[[St Hubert's Key]]" was heated and applied to cauterize the wound. By an application of [[magical thinking]], dogs were branded with the key in hopes of protecting them from rabies. The fear of rabies was almost irrational, due to the significant number of vectors (mostly rabid dogs) and the absence of any efficacious treatment. It was not uncommon for a person, showing no signs of the disease, bitten by a dog merely suspected of being rabid, to commit suicide or to be killed by others.<ref name="Rotivel"/> This gave [[Louis Pasteur]] ample opportunity to test postexposure treatments from 1885.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pyramid.spd.louisville.edu/~eri/fos/interest1.html |title=The Life and Times of Louis Pasteur |publisher=Pyramid.spd.louisville.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref>
In ancient medical times, the attachment of the tongue (the [[lingual frenulum]], a mucous membrane) was cut and removed as this is where rabies was thought to originate. This practice ceased with the discovery of the actual cause of rabies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baer|first=George|title=The Natural History of Rabies|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dw8qW6jcfWUC&pg=PA1&dq=rabies+history#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=31 October 2011|isbn=9780849367601|year=1991}}</ref>

==Other animals==
{{Main|Rabies in animals}}
Rabies is infectious to mammals; three stages are recognized. The first stage is a one- to three-day period characterized by behavioral changes and is known as the [[Prodrome|prodromal stage]]. The second is the excitative stage, which lasts three to four days. This stage is often known as "furious rabies" for the tendency of the affected animal to be hyper-reactive to external stimuli and bite at anything near. The third is the paralytic stage and is caused by damage to [[motor neuron]]s. Incoordination is seen owing to rear limb [[paralysis]], and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles. Death is usually caused by [[respiratory arrest]].<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J | coauthors = Feldman, Edward C |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>

==Research==
Rabies has the advantage over other [[pseudotyping]] methods for gene delivery in that the cell-targeting ([[tissue tropism]]) is more specific for difficult-to-reach sites, such as the [[central nervous system]] without invasive delivery methods, as well as being capable of [[retrograde tracing]] (i.e., going against the flow of information at [[synapses]]) in neuronal circuits.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Gene Therapy|date=8 September 2011| pmid= 21900965 | doi=10.1038/gt.2011.124 |title=Enhanced pseudotyping efficiency of HIV-1 lentiviral vectors by a rabies/vesicular stomatitis virus chimeric envelope glycoprotein | author= Carpentier DCJ, Vevis K, Trabalza A, Georgiadis C, Ellison SM, Asfahani RI, Mazarakis ND|volume=19|issue=7|pages=761–74}}</ref>
