'''Non-surgical rhinoplasty''' is a medical procedure in which injectable fillers, most commonly [[hyaluronic acid]] ones like [[Restylane]] and [[Juvederm]] or [[calcium hydroxyapatite]] (Radiesse), are used to alter and shape a person's nose without [[invasive surgery]].<ref>Beer, K.R., Nasal reconstruction using 20 mg/ml cross-linked hyaluronic acid.

It is a cosmetic procedure and is not used to correct functional problems with the nose, such as breathing difficulties.
 
Originally developed at the turn of the century, early attempts used soft-tissue fillers such as [[paraffin wax]] and [[silicone]]. The procedure was abandoned when disastrous late complications started appearing.<ref>Stupak HD, Moulthrop TH, Wheatley P, Tauman AV, Johnson CM Jr. Calcium hydroxylapatite gel (Radiesse) injection for the correction of postrhinoplasty contour deficiencies and asymmetries.

==History==
Non-surgical [[rhinoplasty]] is reported to have originated at the turn of the nineteenth century, when [[New York City]] [[neurologist]] [[James Leonard Corning]] (1855–1923) and [[Viennese]] physician [[Robert Gersuny]] (1844–1924) began using liquid paraffin wax to elevate the "collapsed nasal [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsum]]" that characterizes the "saddle nose deformity." Yet, despite its corrective efficacy, liquid paraffin proved biologically harmful.<ref name="history"/>

During the 1960s, soft-tissue fillers of medical-grade [[silicone]] gel were introduced to the rhinoplastic surgeons. However, like liquid paraffin, silicone gels proved biologically harmful, causing [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] and [[granuloma]]s, as reported in 1977.<ref name="wilkie"/> To minimize the risk, in 2000 D.S. Orentreich advocated the “microdroplet technique”, minute doses of silicone injected over multiple sessions.<ref name="oren"/>

In 2002, American otolaryngologist [[Dr. Alexander Rivkin]] began using injectable fillers like Restylane and Radiesse that had recently been approved by the FDA to improve the contours of his patients' noses. He developed an office based procedure consisting of a series of small filler injections in precise locations on the nose. After performing the procedure regularly in 2003, Rivkin publicized the method in a variety of mainstream American news outlets<ref name="SS">{{cite news

He observed that straightening the nose made it appear smaller (even though he was augmenting) by making it blend better with the contours of the rest of the face.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3uXwgCtFNM Dr. Alexander Rivkin performing non-surgical rhinoplasty on NBC's Today Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="fouryearreview"/> This observation was echoed by later physicians as well.<ref>Dayan SH, Greene RM, Chambers AA.

In 2005, the [[Australian]] Dr. Andrew Tuan-Anh Le published a pilot study reporting successful corrective outcomes using the soft-tissue filler [[polyacrylamide gel]] (PAAG), a hydrophilic [[colloid]] injected to the tissues of the nasal defect, and known commercially as [[Aquamid]].<ref name="LeAndrew"/><ref name="NonsurgicalRhinoplasty"/> Other soft-tissue fillers have since come into use as well, and the injection procedures have gained popularity due to their [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|non-invasiveness]] and low cost.

Because the nose is the anchor-feature of the face, an aesthetically proportionate nose balances the [[physiognomic]] features of a person. Non-surgical correction is considered for patients with a treatment-suitable aesthetic defect, or a defect resulting from a surgical rhinoplasty (either primary or secondary). Although the procedure is usually performed for aesthetic purposes, it can also be used to correct some [[birth defects]]. Because the procedure is not invasive, bruising and swelling are minimal. The procedure is not meant to decrease nose size, although it can make the nose appear smaller by making it look straighter. It is frequently used to increase the height and definition of the nasal bridge, as well as augmenting other precisely defined areas of the nose. The procedure is not used to correct functional defects. Non-surgical rhinoplasty is used by patients of all ethnicities.

The filler-injection technique allows for:
*the augmentation of a flat nasal bridge (depressed dorsum)
*the added projection of the nasal tip
*correction of retracted [[nasal septum|columella]]
*small reduction of nostril size
*the perceptual diminution of a nasal hump
*filling a nasal sidewall depression
*enhancing a retracted [[anterior nasal spine]]
*the enhancement of a retracted maxilla lateral to the [[pyriform aperture|pyriform]] (pear-shaped) aperture to displace the anterior plane
*the elevation of a saddle nose deformity caused by a failed primary rhinoplasty
*traumatic injury<ref name="Kot"/>

As with other aesthetic procedures, possible complications of the procedure can include [[infection]], [[hematoma]], discomfort, anatomic asymmetry, or foreign body reaction (called [[granuloma]]s). Granulomas are extremely rare, and are most seen with impure silicone and some of the early non-modern versions of [[methyl]]-[[methacrylate]] ([[Artecoll]] or Arteplast, though not [[Artefill]]).<ref name="history"/>

==Modern fillers==
Duration of results depends on the type of filler used. Modern injectable soft-tissue filler agents include:
*'''[[Hyaluronic acid]]''' ([[Juvederm]], [[Restylane]], Perlane or Voluma)&nbsp;– a safe and non allergenic temporary filler that lasts for 6 to 10 months. This filler can be dissolved with injections of an enzyme called hyaluronidase.<ref name="fouryearreview"/>
*'''[[Calcium hydroxyapatite]]''' (Radiesse)&nbsp;– A calcium based, non allergenic filler that is sturdier than hyaluronic acid and lasts for 10 to 14 months. It is not reversible, however.
*'''[[Polymethylmethacrylate]]''' ([[Artefill]])&nbsp;– A permanent filler made from inert, microscopic surgical plastic beads. It is packaged with bovine collagen as a carrier, so a skin test is necessary prior to treatment. This filler is injected over several treatment sessions.<ref name="kotler"/><ref name="facial"/>
*'''[[Silicone gel|Liquid silicone]]'''&nbsp;– Medical grade silicone is sometimes used in a microdroplet technique for permanent versions of the procedure.
*'''[[Polyacrylamide gel]]''' (PAAG or [[Aquamid]])&nbsp;– A permanent filler used most frequently in Asia and Australia. Some studies have since found increased complications with Aquamid. It is not approved by the U.S. FDA.<ref name="history"/>

==Techniques==
The preferred anesthesia for non surgical rhinoplasty is topical cream (topical anesthesia). Some physicians use [[Local anesthesia|local]] [[anaesthesia]] (i.e. lidocaine injections), but that can obscure the area being injected.

The physician injector uses a sterile syringe, prepackaged with filler and a [[hypodermic needle]] (e.g. 27-G, 25 mm) to inject the material under the nasal skin, most commonly in the deep [[subcutaneous tissues]], immediately above the [[periosteum]]. 

The procedure for injecting and placing the soft-tissue filler typically take 10 to 30 minutes to perform in the surgeon’s consultation room, after an initial 15 minutes of numbing. After the procedure, the patient can typically resume normal life activities immediately.
