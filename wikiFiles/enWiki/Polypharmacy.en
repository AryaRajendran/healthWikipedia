'''Polypharmacy''' (also called '''polymedicine''') is the use of multiple [[medication]]s by a patient.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20964461</ref> It sometimes alternatively refers to purportedly excessive or unnecessary prescriptions.<ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/polypharmacy</ref> The variant "polymedicine" is less likely than "polypharmacy" to bear the negative connotation of ''excess'' (and it is also more likely to refer to multiple drugs treating a ''single'' disease, known better as [[combination therapy]]),<ref>https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent?id=uuid:296273b7-559f-4b5c-8460-b9500d04c0bf&ds=DATA_FILE</ref> but both terms lack for universally consistent definition.

Benefits of polypharmacy can include enhanced efficacy of treatment as well as improved safety and tolerability of pharmacotherapy.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20964461</ref> Concerns about polypharmacy include increased [[adverse drug reaction]]s, drug-drug interactions, and higher costs.<ref name="pmid19054196">{{cite journal |author=Haider SI, Johnell K, Weitoft GR, Thorslund M, Fastbom J |title=The influence of educational level on polypharmacy and inappropriate drug use: a register-based study of more than 600,000 older people. |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=62–69 |year=2009 |pmid=19054196 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.02040.x }}</ref> Polypharmacy is most common in the [[elderly]].<ref name="pmid18184532">{{cite journal |author=Haider SI, Johnell K, Thorslund M, Fastbom J |title=Trends in polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions across educational groups in elderly patients in Sweden for the period 1992 - 2002 |journal=International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=643–653 |year=2007 |pmid=18184532 }}</ref> 

==Pill burden==
Pill burden is a term that refers to the number of pills (tablets or capsules, the most common dosage forms) that a patient takes on a regular basis, along with all associated efforts that increase with that number - like storing, organizing, consuming, and understanding the various medications in one's regimen.

High pill burden decreases [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] with drug therapy, resulting from the need to take a large quantity of pills or other forms of medication on a regular basis. It also increases the possibility of adverse medication reactions ([[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]]) and [[Drug interaction|drug-drug interactions]]. High pill burden has also been associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, medication errors, and increased costs for both the pharmaceuticals themselves and for the treatment of adverse events. Finally, pill burden is a source of dissatisfaction for many patients.

High pill burden is commonly associated with [[antiretroviral drug]] regimens to control [[HIV]], but can be seen in other patient populations. For instance, adults with multiple chronic conditions such as [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[lymphedema]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[osteoporosis]], [[constipation]], and [[clinical depression]] can often be prescribed more than a dozen different medications daily. The adverse reactions of these combinations of drugs are not reliably predictable. [[Obesity]] is implicated in many of the aforementioned conditions, and it is not uncommon for a clinically obese patient to receive pharmacologic treatment for all of these.  Because chronic conditions tend to accumulate in the elderly, pill burden is a particular issue in [[geriatrics]].

Reducing pill burden is recognized as a way to improve medication compliance.  Common approaches for reducing pill burden include selecting [[fixed dose combination]] drug products, products with long-acting active ingredients, and [[sustained release|sustained release/extended release]] formulations when appropriate.

Some combinations of drugs may be available in certain strengths as a single pill, called a [[fixed dose combination]].  One notable example of a fixed dose combination drug product is the antiretroviral drug product [[Atripla]], which combines 3 drugs ([[efavirenz]] + [[emtricitabine]] + [[tenofovir]]) into one pill.

The selection of long-acting active ingredients over short-acting ones may also reduce pill burden.  For instance, [[ACE inhibitor]]s are used in the management of [[hypertension]].  Both [[captopril]] and [[lisinopril]] are examples of ACE inhibitors.  However, lisinopril is dosed once a day, whereas captopril may be dosed 2-3 times a day.  Assuming that there are no contraindications or potential for drug interactions, using lisinopril instead of captopril may be an appropriate way to limit pill burden.  

Similarly, [[Sustained release|sustained release/extended release]] drug formulations reduce pill burden by reducing the dosing frequency.  The same active ingredient is present in both the immediate-release form and the sustained release form.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Whether or not the advantages of polypharmacy (over monotherapy) outweight the disadvantages or risks depends upon the particular combination and diagnosis involved in any given case.<ref>http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=115997</ref> The use of multiple drugs, even in fairly straightforward illnesses, is not an indicator of poor treatment. A perfectly legitimate treatment regimen could include, for example, the following: two antidepressants, three antihypertensives, a beta blocker, a calcium channel blocker, a bone saving bisphosphonate, an antiepileptic, a stomach saving H2 blocker, aspirin, prostaglandin blocker, lactoferrin, a calcium-magnesium supplement and herbal preparations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sergi|first=G|coauthors=De Rui, M; Sarti, S; Manzato, E|title=Polypharmacy in the elderly: Can comprehensive geriatric assessment reduce inappropriate medication use?|journal=Drugs Aging|year=2011|volume=28|issue=7|pages=509–518}}</ref> 

Considerations often associated with thoughtful, therapeutic polypharmacy include: (1) Drugs given for a single somatic locale act on biochemical mechanisms present throughout the body such that their nonlinear interactions can produce an (unknown except empirically) global physiological state of health;<ref>Mandell, A.J. and Selz, K.A. 1992 Dynamical systems in psychiatry: Now what? ''Biological Psychiatry'' '''32''': 299-301.</ref>(2) The more independent variables, "handles", to manipulate, the greater the likelihood of finding and stabilizing a small available parametric space of healthy function while minimizing unwanted effects.<ref>Callahan, J. and Sashin, J. I. 1987 Models of affect-response and anorexia nervosa. ''Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.'' '''504''':241-259.</ref>

===Positive examples===
Often certain medications can interact with others in a positive way specifically intended when prescribed together, to achieve a greater effect that any of the single agents alone. This is particularly prominent in the field of anesthesia and pain management - where atypical agents such as antiepileptics, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, NMDA antagonists, and other medications are combined with more typical analgesics such as opioids, prostaglandin inhibitors, NSAIDS and others. This practice of pain management drug synergy is known as an ''analgesia sparring'' effect. 

As another example, in anesthesia (particularly IV anesthesia and general anesthesia) multiple agents are almost always required - including hypnotics or analgesic inducing/maintenance agents such as Versed or Diprivan, usually an opioid analgesic such as morphine or Demerol, a paralytic such as vecuronium, and in inhaled general anesthesia generally a halogenated ether anesthetic such as sevoflurane or desflurane.

===Concerns===
Every medication has potential adverse side-effects. With every drug added, there is an additive risk of side-effects. Also, many medications have potential [[Drug interaction|interactions]] with other substances.  As a new drug is prescribed, the risk of interactions increases exponentially.  Doctors and [[Pharmacy|pharmacists]] aim to avoid prescribing medications that interact; often, adjustments in the dose of medications need to be made to avoid interactions, such as with [[warfarin]], as it may lose its effect.

Patients at greatest risk for negative polypharmacy consequences include the [[elderly]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] patients, patients taking five or more drugs concurrently, those with multiple [[physician]]s and [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]], recently hospitalized patients, individuals with concurrent [[comorbidity|comorbidities]],<ref name="pmid16091574">{{cite journal |author=Boyd CM, Darer J, Boult C, Fried LP, Boult L, Wu AW |title=Clinical practice guidelines and quality of care for older patients with multiple comorbid diseases: implications for pay for performance |journal=JAMA |volume=294 |issue=6 |pages=716–24 |year=2005 |pmid=16091574 |doi=10.1001/jama.294.6.716}}</ref> low educational level,<ref name="pmid18343279">{{cite journal |author=Haider SI, Johnell K, Thorslund M, Fastbom J |title= Analysis of the association between polypharmacy and socioeconomic position among elderly aged >/=77 years in Sweden |journal= Clin Ther |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=419–27 |year=2007 |pmid=18343279 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2008.02.010 }}</ref> and those with impaired vision or dexterity.

It is not uncommon for those dependent or addicted to substances to enter or remain in a state of polypharmacy misuse. Note, however, that the term ''polypharmacy'' and its variants generally refer to legal drug use as-prescribed, even when used in a negative or critical context.

Measures can be taken to limit polypharmacy to its truly legitimate and appropriate needs. Zarowitz ''et al.''<ref name=Zarowitz>Zarowitz BJ, Stebelsky LA, Muma BK, Romain TM, Peterson EL. Reduction of high-risk polypharmacy drug combinations in patients in a managed care setting. ''Pharmacotherapy'' 2005;25:1636-45. PMID 16232025.</ref>{{Primary source-inline|reason=Per policy we shouldn't be interpreting primary sources.|date=November 2011}} studied clinical pharmacists performing drug therapy reviews and the teaching of physicians and their patients about drug safety and polypharmacy, as well as collaborating with physicians and patients to correct polypharmacy problems.  This led to a marked improvement in interactions and cost.  Similar programs are likely to reduce the potentially deleterious consequences of polypharmacy.  Such programs hinge upon patients and doctors informing pharmacists of other medications being prescribed, as well as herbal, over-the-counter substances and supplements that occasionally interfere with prescription-only medication.
