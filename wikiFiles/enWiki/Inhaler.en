An '''inhaler''' or '''puffer''' is a medical device used for delivering medication into the body via the lungs. It is mainly used in the treatment of [[asthma]] and [[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease]] (COPD). [[Zanamivir|Zanamivir (Relenza)]], used to treat [[influenzavirus|influenza]], must be administered via inhaler. To reduce deposition in the mouth and throat, and to reduce the need for precise synchronization of the start of inhalation with actuation of the device, MDIs are sometimes used with a complementary [[Asthma spacer|spacer]] or holding chamber device.

==Types==
===Metered-dose inhalers===
'''MDI''' — The most common type of inhaler is the pressurized [[metered-dose inhaler]] (MDI). In MDIs, medication is most commonly stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant, although it may also be a suspension.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Hickey, A.J. |title=Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=NY |year=2004 |edition=2nd |url=}}</ref> The MDI canister is attached to a plastic, hand-operated actuator. On activation, the metered-dose inhaler releases a fixed dose of medication in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol]] form. The correct procedure for using an MDI is to first fully exhale, place the mouth-piece of the device into the mouth, and having just started to inhale at a moderate rate, depress the canister to release the medicine. The aerosolized medication is drawn into the lungs by continuing to inhale deeply before holding the breath for 10 seconds to allow the aerosol to settle onto the walls of the [[bronchus|bronchial]] and other airways of the lung.

===Dry powder inhalers===
'''DPI''' — [[Dry powder inhaler]]s release a metered or device-measured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a DPI device.

===Nebulizers===
[[Nebulizer]]s — supply the medication as an aerosol created from an aqueous formulation.

===Analgesic inhalers===

In 1968, Robert Wexler of [[Abbott Laboratories]] developed the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler that allowed the self-administration of [[methoxyflurane]] [[vapor]] in air for [[analgesia]].<ref name=Wexler1968/> The Analgizer consisted of a [[polyethylene]] cylinder 5&nbsp;inches long and 1&nbsp;inch in diameter with a 1&nbsp;inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled [[Candle wick|wick]] of [[polypropylene]] [[felt]] which held 15&nbsp;[[Litre#SI_prefixes_applied_to_the_litre|milliliters]] of methoxyflurane. Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|conscious analgesia]] which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15&nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly [[Amnesia|amnesic]] to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with [[bone fracture]]s and [[joint dislocation]]s,<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> and for dressing changes on [[burn]] patients.<ref name=Packer1969/> When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent [[adverse effect]] on [[Apgar score]]s.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> All [[vital signs]] remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and [[sedation]] until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.<ref name=Major1966/><ref name=Dragon1967/><ref name=Firn1972/><ref name=Josephson1974/> The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the [[Penthrox inhaler]].<ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Grindlay2009/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Penthrox2009/><ref name=RADAR2010/>

==Propellants==
In 2009, the FDA banned the use of inhalers that utilize [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFC) as propellants for [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFA) inhalers; HFA is not environmentally inert as a [[greenhouse gas]] but does not affect the ozone layer.<ref name=baumann/> While some asthma sufferers and advocacy groups contend that the latter are not as effective,<ref name="storyid1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/living_green/story.aspx?storyid=149094&catid=116 |title=Asthma Group Concerned "Green" Inhalers May Not be as Effective &#124; ksdk.com &#124; St. Louis, MO |publisher=ksdk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref> published clinical studies indicate equivalent control of asthma is achieved with use of HFA inhalers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hendeles L, Colice GL, Meyer RJ |title=Withdrawal of albuterol inhalers containing chlorofluorocarbon propellants |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=356 |issue=13 |pages=1344–51 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17392304 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra050380 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/356/13/1344.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Inhalers used to treat asthma contains dry powder spin inhalers and aerosoles containing suspending liquid medicament, but in both the cases the size of suspended particles or powder particles must be less than 5 micrometres so as to increase the surface area and deliver the drug to the inner most areas.  Such a sufficiently small size of particles is necessary for dispersion and also for rapid action.

While the impact of CFC of inhalers on the [[ozone layer]] had been minuscule, the FDA in its interpretation of the [[Montreal Protocol]] mandated the switch in propellants.<ref name=baumann>{{cite journal |url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2011/07/cost-increase-asthma-inhalers-expensive |author=[[Nick Baumann]] |title=Why You're Paying More to Breathe| journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=July/August 2011}}</ref> Patients expressed concern about the high price of the HFA inhalers as there is no generic version, which had been available in the CFC inhalers for many years.<ref name="storyid1"/> The elimination of generics from the market led to a price increase in inhalers that is expected to cost American consumers, insurances and the government about $8 billion by 2017.<ref name=baumann/>

==Manufacturers==
The largest manufacturers of inhalers are [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (makers of the Advair Discus, a DPI), [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], [[AstraZeneca]] (makers of Pulmicort and Symbicort) and [[Boehringer-Ingelheim]] (makers of Atrovent, Combivent, and Spiriva). BI, GSK, Merck, and AstraZeneca manufacture the medication being delivered via inhaler. However, [[3M]] Drug Delivery Systems does some of the finished product manufacturing, as they are one of the leaders of MDI canisters, metering valves and other components.
