'''SoundBite Hearing System''' is a non-surgical bone conduction [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] device that transmits sound via the teeth. It is an alternative to earlier surgical [[bone conduction]] prosthetic devices, which require surgical implantation of a metal post into the skull to conduct sound.

SoundBite uses the tooth instead of the post and eliminates the need for surgery. It is therefore typically lower in complications and in cost than the prevalent surgical treatment.

SoundBite Hearing System has two principal components: a behind-the-ear (BTE) microphone unit that is worn on the impaired ear and a removable, custom-made in-the-mouth (ITM) hearing device worn on the upper, left or right back teeth. Both components have rechargeable batteries and a charger is included.

Sound is captured and processed by the BTE microphone unit which transmits signals to the ITM hearing device. The ITM receives these signals and converts them into sound vibrations. These imperceptible sound vibrations travel via the teeth, through bones in the skull, to the functioning inner ear or cochlea, bypassing problems in the outer or middle ear entirely. As such, the device is intended to help patients with [[Unilateral hearing loss|single-sided deafness]] (SSD) and [[conductive hearing loss]] (CHL) and has received FDA clearance for these indications. SoundBite is developed and marketed by Sonitus Medical, Inc.

==History==
[[Unilateral hearing loss|Single-sided deafness]] (SSD) and [[conductive hearing loss]] (CHL) are life-altering conditions where patients often have anxiety, depression, social isolation and reduced quality of life.<ref name=HLEC>{{cite web |title=Who Has Hearing Loss|url=http://www.hearinglosseducation.com/Hearing/who-has-hearing-loss.asp|work=Hearing Loss Education Center|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=Dimmelow>{{cite web|last=Dimmelow|first=K.L.|title=Hear on the other side|url=http://www.singlesideddeafness.com/ssd_report.pdf|work=SingleSidedDeafness.com|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> SSD patients have one cochlea that is virtually non-functional. It does not hear sound even when amplified by hearing aids, which are amplification devices that simply “turn up the volume” on air-conducted sound. CHL patients have a problem with the ear (outer, middle or canal) that prohibits air conducted sound from reaching an otherwise functional cochlea and can feel pain or distortion with amplification. Therefore, the traditional treatment approach has been a prosthetic device called [[Cochlear Baha|Baha]], which replaces the function of the impaired ear by using a well-established principle called bone conduction to re-route sound through the skull bones to the functional cochlea. 

The [[Bone anchored hearing aid|Baha bone conduction]] prosthetic device is used rather than [[hearing aid]]s because hearing aids are medically inappropriate for these patients. The Baha surgery can cause complications that range from skin reaction to infection, to abscess, to complete re-implantation or revision of the Baha post.<ref name=Medicare>{{cite web|title=Medicare Benefit Policy Manual|url=http://www.cms.gov/manuals/downloads/bp102c16.pdf|work=United States Government|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref>

The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual distinguishes between hearing aids and prosthetic devices, and indicates that certain devices (including Baha) are payable by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] as prosthetic devices when hearing aids are medically inappropriate.<ref name=Implantation>{{cite journal|last=George|first=A P|coauthors=De, R|title=Review of temporal bone dissection teaching: how it was, is and will be|journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology|date=NaN undefined NaN |year=2009|month=December|volume=124|issue=02|pages=119|doi=10.1017/S0022215109991617|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7152256&fulltextType=RV&fileId=S0022215109991617|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>

The principle of bone conduction has been used for many years to treat patients with single-sided deafness and conductive hearing loss. The principle is based on research showing that bone conduction stimulation of the teeth of the lower jaw initiates auditory sensations. Evidence shows that teeth vibrations lead to audio-frequency vibration transmissions via soft tissue. Those transmissions then travel through skull foramina into the skull cavity. From there, they channel into the inner ear fluids, stimulating the [[cochlea]].<ref name="Physiology and pharmacology">{{cite journal|last=Ozer |first=Eyal |coauthors=Adelman, Freeman, Sohmer|title=Bone conduction hearing on the teeth of the lower jaw|journal=Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology|date=27|year=2002|month=May|volume=13|issue=2|pages=89–96 |doi=10.1515/JBCPP.2002.13.2.89 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jbcpp.2002.13.2/jbcpp.2002.13.2.89/jbcpp.2002.13.2.89.xml?format=INT|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Subsequently, Sonitus Medical developed SoundBite Hearing System to use those principles in a non-surgical, removable hearing system.

==Clinical trials==
A multi-center clinical trial conducted in 2011 validated that SoundBite is safe and effective and provides substantial benefit for individuals with single-sided deafness (SSD). Trial participants wore SoundBite for 30 days, using the device an average of 8.2 hours per day. Based on the clinical trial results, SoundBite improves the ability of individuals with SSD to understand speech in an environment with background noise by an average of 25%. One-third of the trial participants found that the system improved their hearing ability by more than 30%. The results of this extensive clinical trial showed SoundBite to be as effective as surgically implanted bone conduction systems in improving the ability to understand speech in an environment with background noise.<ref name="Otology & Neurotology">{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Michael |coauthors=Popelka, Miller |title=Efficacy and Safety of an In-the-Mouth Bone Conduction Device for Single-Sided Deafness|journal=Otology & Neurotology |date=1 |year=2011|month=April|volume=32|issue=3|pages=437–443 |doi=10.1097/MAO.0b013e3182096b1d |url=http://journals.lww.com/otology-neurotology/Abstract/2011/04000/Efficacy_and_Safety_of_an_In_the_Mouth_Bone.14.aspx |accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:SoundBite ITM Unit.png|thumb|199px|alt=ITM (In-The-Mouth) Hearing Device|ITM (In-The-Mouth) Hearing Device]]
[[File:SoundBite BTE.jpg|thumb|alt=BTE (Behind-The-Ear) Microphone Unit|BTE (Behind-The-Ear) Microphone Unit]]

[[Sound|Sound vibrations]], like waves that travel across water’s surface, travel through a medium. Sound is heard when sound waves travel through the medium of air &mdash; or bones/teeth &mdash; to arrive at the inner ears. SoundBite Hearing System uses this concept known as bone conduction: the transmission of imperceptible sound vibrations through bones to the inner ears.

SoundBite Hearing System is a non-surgical and removable bone conduction hearing device that re-routes sound through the teeth, through skull bone, directly to the functioning inner ear or cochlea. It by-passes problems in the outer and middle ears entirely. For patients suffering from single-sided deafness, SoundBite re-routes sound from the [[Deafness|deaf]] side, to the functioning cochlea, by-passing the non-hearing side. 

SoundBite uses the same mechanism of action as Baha (bone conduction) only it places a transducer on the tooth &mdash;a “naturally osseointegrated” post &mdash; and thereby eliminates the need to implant a post through surgery. 
 
SoundBite relies on two primary components to deliver sound: 
	
* The behind-the-ear (BTE) microphone unit is worn on the patient’s deaf ear. Using the natural acoustic benefits of the outer ear, sound is collected and channeled into the [[ear canal]]. A tiny microphone is placed within the canal of the impaired ear and is connected by a small tube to the BTE. The BTE uses a digital signal processor to process the sound and a wireless chip to transmit the sound signals to the ITM hearing device.
* The in-the-mouth (ITM) hearing device is custom-made to fit around the upper, left or right, back teeth. The ITM picks up the signals from the BTE and converts them into imperceptible vibrations that travel via the teeth, through bone, and to the cochlea. Once these sound vibrations reach the inner ear, they are converted into electrical signals which are sent to the brain and are interpreted as sound.

The BTE unit has a 12-to-15-hour operational life when fully charged.<ref name="Journal of Orthodontics">{{cite journal |last=Miller|first=Ross|title=It's time we listened to our teeth:The SoundBite hearing system|journal=American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics|date=5|year=2010|month=November|volume=138|issue=5|pages=666–669 |doi=10.1016/j.ajodo.2010.03.027 |url=http://www.ajodo.org/article/S0889-5406%2810%2900628-1/abstract|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Each ITM hearing device has a 6-to-8 hour operational life when fully charged.<ref name="Journal of Orthodontics">{{cite journal}}</ref>

The BTE unit delivers a broader frequency [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (up to 12,000&nbsp;Hz) as compared to existing devices for single-sided deafness. This broader bandwidth enhances [[Spatial hearing loss|spatial hearing ability]], which is a key limitation for SSD patients.<ref name="Novel Bone Conduction">{{cite journal|last=Popelka |first=Gerald |coauthors=Derebery J., Blevins N., Murray M., Moore B., Sweetow R., Wu B., Katsis M.|title=Preliminary Evaluation of a Novel Bone-Conduction Device for Single-Sided Deafness|journal=Otology & Neurotology |date=2|year=2010|month=April |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=492–497 |doi=10.1097/MAO.0b013e3181be6741|url=http://journals.lww.com/otology-neurotology/Abstract/2010/04000/Preliminary_Evaluation_of_a_Novel_Bone_Conduction.22.aspx |accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref>

== Treatment process ==
The patient is evaluated by an audiologist to determine degree of hearing loss to determine if the patient is a candidate for SoundBite. A dentist then performs a dental screening and takes a partial impression of the patient's teeth, which is used to create a customized SoundBite ITM hearing device. The ITM and BTE are fitted and adjusted, and the system is programmed by a hearing professional.<ref name="Journal of Orthodontics">{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Ross|title=It's time we listened to our teeth: The SoundBite hearing system|journal=American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics|date=5|year=2010 |month=November|volume=138|issue=5|pages=666–669|doi=10.1016/j.ajodo.2010.03.027|url=http://www.ajodo.org/article/S0889-5406%2810%2900628-1/abstract|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>

[[File:SoundBite vs. Baha Overview.png|thumb|375px|SoundBite's naturally osseointegtrated post diagram]]

=== Candidates and indications ===
SoundBite is appropriate for patients who are 18 years or older, with good oral health, with:
* Single-sided deafness, defined as moderately severe, severe, or profound [[sensorineural hearing loss]] in one ear (problems with the inner ear), with normal hearing in the other ear
* Conductive hearing loss (problems with the outer or middle ear)
  
The SoundBite prosthetic device uses the established principle of bone conduction to eliminate the need for a surgery and implant, by imperceptibly transmitting sound. SoundBite delivers sound directly to the functioning [[inner ear]] (cochlea) thereby replacing the function of the impaired ear.
