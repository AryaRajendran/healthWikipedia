'''Warfarin''' (also known under the brand names '''Coumadin''', '''Jantoven''', '''Marevan''', '''Lawarin''', '''Waran''', and '''Warfant''') is an [[anticoagulant]] normally used in the prevention of [[thrombosis]] and [[thromboembolism]], the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels and their migration elsewhere in the body respectively. It was initially introduced in 1948 as a [[pesticide]] against [[rat]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] and is still used for this purpose, although more potent poisons such as [[brodifacoum]] have since been developed. In the early 1950s warfarin was found to be effective and relatively safe for [[prophylaxis|preventing]] [[thrombosis]] and [[embolism]] (abnormal formation and migration of blood clots) in many disorders. It was approved for use as a medication in 1954 and has remained popular ever since; warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant drug in North America.<ref name=Holbrook/>

Despite its effectiveness, treatment with warfarin has several shortcomings. Many commonly used medications [[drug interaction|interact]] with warfarin, as do some foods (particularly [[leaf vegetable]] foods or "greens," since these typically contain large amounts of [[vitamin K|vitamin K<sub>1</sub>]]) and its activity has to be monitored by [[blood test]]ing for the [[prothrombin time|international normalized ratio]] (INR) to ensure an adequate yet safe dose is taken.<ref name="Ansell">{{cite journal| author=Ansell J, Hirsh J, Hylek E, ''et al''.| title=Pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th Edition) | journal=Chest | year= 2008 | volume= 133 | issue= 6 Suppl | pages= 160S-198S | pmid=18574265 | doi=10.1378/chest.08-0670 | url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1085927 }}</ref> A high INR predisposes to a high risk of bleeding, while an INR below the therapeutic target indicates that the dose of warfarin is insufficient to protect against thromboembolic events.

Warfarin and related [[4-hydroxycoumarin]]-containing molecules decrease blood [[coagulation]] by inhibiting [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]], an [[enzyme]] that recycles [[oxidation|oxidized]] vitamin K<sub>1</sub> to its reduced form after it has participated in the [[carboxylation]] of several blood coagulation proteins, mainly [[prothrombin]] and [[factor VII]]. Despite being labeled a [[Anticoagulant#Coumarins (vitamin K antagonists)|vitamin K antagonist]],<ref name="Ansell"/> warfarin does not antagonize the action of vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, but rather antagonizes vitamin K<sub>1</sub> recycling, depleting active vitamin K<sub>1</sub>.<ref>Holford NH. Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Understanding the dose-effect relationship. Clin Pharmacokinet 1986; 11: 483–504.</ref> Thus, the pharmacologic action may always be reversed by fresh vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. When administered, these drugs do not anticoagulate blood immediately. Instead, onset of their effect requires about a day before remaining active clotting factors have had time to naturally disappear in metabolism, and the duration of action of a single dose of warfarin is 2 to 5 days. Reversal of warfarin's effect when it is discontinued or vitamin K<sub>1</sub> is administered, requires a similar time.

Warfarin is a synthetic derivative of [[dicoumarol]], a 4-hydroxycoumarin-derived [[mycotoxin]] anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled [[sweet clover]]-based animal feeds. Dicoumarol, in turn, is derived from [[coumarin]], a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found naturally in "sweet" clover (to which it gives its odor and name), [[Dipteryx odorata|tonka beans]] (also known as "cumaru" from which coumarin's name derives) and many other plants. The name ''warfarin'' stems from its discovery at the [[University of Wisconsin]], incorporating the acronym for the organization which funded the key research (''WARF'', for ''[[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]]'') and the ending ''-arin,'' indicating its link with coumarin.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Medical uses==
Warfarin is used to decrease the tendency for [[thrombosis]] or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals that have already formed a blood clot ([[thrombus]]). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help reduce the risk of [[embolism]] (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=coumadin|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/coumadin.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Warfarin is best suited for anticoagulation (clot formation inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are [[atrial fibrillation]], the presence of [[artificial heart valve]]s, [[deep venous thrombosis]], and [[pulmonary embolism]] (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks ([[myocardial infarction]]s), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with [[antiplatelet drug]]s, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally has no effect on platelet function).<ref name=Hirsh>{{cite journal |author=Hirsh J, [[Valentin Fuster|Fuster V]], Ansell J, [[Jonathan L. Halperin|Halperin JL]] |title=American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guide to warfarin therapy |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1633–52 |year=2003 |pmid=12742309 |url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/41/9/1633| doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00416-9}}</ref>

===Alternative anticoagulants===

In some countries, other coumarins are used instead of warfarin, such as [[acenocoumarol]] and [[phenprocoumon]]. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) [[Biological half-life|half-life]], and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as [[dabigatran]] and [[rivaroxaban]], have recently been approved in a number of countries for classical wafarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development.<!--An initial failure was [[ximelagatran]] (trade name Exanta), however, reports of [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage) prompted its manufacturer to withdraw it from further development. A similar and later drug dabigatran has since been more successful--><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hirsh J, O'Donnell M, Eikelboom JW |title=Beyond unfractionated heparin and warfarin: current and future advances |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=552–60 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17664384 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685974 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/116/5/552}}</ref>

===Dosing===
Dosing of warfarin is complicated by the fact that it is known to interact with many commonly used medications and even with chemicals that may be present in certain foods.<ref name=Holbrook/> These interactions may enhance or reduce warfarin's anticoagulation effect. In order to optimize the therapeutic effect without risking dangerous side effects such as bleeding, close monitoring of the degree of anticoagulation is required by blood testing ([[prothrombin time|INR]]). During the initial stage of treatment, checking may be required daily; intervals between tests can be lengthened if the patient manages stable therapeutic INR levels on an unchanged warfarin dose.<ref name=Hirsh/>

When initiating warfarin therapy ("warfarinization"), the doctor will decide how strong the anticoagulant therapy needs to be. The target INR level will vary from case to case depending on the clinical indicators, but tends to be 2–3 in most conditions. In particular, target INR may be 2.5–3.5 (or even 3.0–4.5) in patients with one or more [[artificial heart valve#Mechanical valves|mechanical heart valve]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baglin TP, Keeling DM, Watson HG |title=Guidelines on oral anticoagulation (warfarin): third edition—2005 update |journal=Br.

====Loading dose====
Several researchers have proposed algorithms for commencing warfarin treatment:
* The Kovacs 10&nbsp;mg algorithm was better than a 5&nbsp;mg algorithm.<ref name="pmid12729425">{{cite journal | author = Kovacs MJ, Rodger M, Anderson DR, Morrow B, Kells G, Kovacs J, Boyle E, Wells PS | title = Comparison of 10-mg and 5-mg warfarin initiation nomograms together with low-molecular-weight heparin for outpatient treatment of acute venous thromboembolism.

* Lenzini ''et al.'' derived and prospectively validated a model including ''CYP2C9'' and ''VKORC1'' genotypes.  This model could predict 70% of the variation in warfarin doses in a validation cohort (versus 48% without genotype).

====Maintenance dose====
Recommendations by many national bodies including the [[American College of Chest Physicians]]<ref name="Ansell"/> have been distilled to help manage dose adjustments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050515/pocform.html |title=Point-of-Care Guides: May&nbsp;15, 2005. American Family Physician |accessdate=20 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929083239/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050515/pocform.html |archivedate = 29 September 2007}}</ref>

The [[maintenance dose]] of warfarin can fluctuate significantly depending on the amount of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> in the diet. Keeping vitamin K<sub>1</sub> intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. Green parts of members of the family [[Apiaceae]] such as [[parsley]], [[cilantro]] and [[dill]] are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; [[Cruciferous vegetables]] such as [[cabbage]] and [[broccoli]] as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens are also relatively high in vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. Green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K<sub>1</sub>.  Foods that are low in vitamin K<sub>1</sub> include roots, bulbs, tubers, and most fruits and fruit juices. Cereals, grains and other milled products are also low in vitamin K<sub>1</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/warfarin/AN00455|title=Warfarin diet: What foods should I avoid?|publisher=Mayoclinic.com|accessdate=9 August 2011}}</ref>

====Self-testing====
{{Main|INR self-monitoring}}
Patients are making increasing use of self-testing and home monitoring of oral anticoagulation. International guidelines on home testing were published in 2005.<ref name="Ansell2005">{{cite journal |author=Ansell J, Jacobson A, Levy J, Völler H, Hasenkam JM |title=Guidelines for implementation of patient self-testing and patient self-management of oral anticoagulation. International consensus guidelines prepared by International Self-Monitoring Association for Oral Anticoagulation |journal=Int. J.

All patients must be appropriately selected and trained. Currently available self-testing/self-management devices give INR results which are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing."<ref name=Ansell2005/> A 2006 [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] of 14 randomized trials showed that home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (thrombosis and major bleeding) and improved the time in the therapeutic range.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heneghan C, Alonso-Coello P, Garcia-Alamino JM, Perera R, Meats E, Glasziou P |title=Self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9508 |pages=404–11 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16458764 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68139-7|url = http://www.hadassah.org.il/NR/rdonlyres/7DD940DC-E6B5-43FA-8869-288CAE8FF831/7797/Selfmonitoringoforalanticoagulationasystematicrevi.pdf}}</ref>

==Contraindications==

===Pregnancy===
{{further2|[[Anticoagulation in pregnancy]]}}
Warfarin is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in pregnancy, as it passes through the [[placenta]]l barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]], [[stillbirth]], [[perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|neonatal death]], and [[preterm birth]].<ref name=HDT>{{cite book |author=Macina, Orest T.; Schardein, James L. |title=Human Developmental Toxicants |publisher=CRC Taylor & Francis |chapter=Warfarin |location=Boca Raton |year=2007 |pages=193–4 |isbn=0-8493-7229-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=8_Lc58cGZj0C}} Retrieved on 15 December 2008 through [[Google Book Search]].</ref> Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also [[teratogen]]s, that is, they cause [[birth defect]]s; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin ''[[in utero]]'' appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) have been reported in some studies.<ref name=Loftus>{{cite book |author=Loftus, Christopher M. |title=Neurosurgical Aspects of Pregnancy |chapter=Fetal toxicity of common neurosurgical drugs |publisher=American Association of Neurological Surgeons |location=Park Ridge, Ill |year=1995 |pages=11–3 |isbn=1-879284-36-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=X58R5BqtHmEC}}</ref> Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.<ref name=HDT/>

When warfarin (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) is given during the first trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as [[fetal warfarin syndrome]] (FWS), ''warfarin embryopathy'', or ''coumarin embryopathy'' can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by [[skeletal]] abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, [[scoliosis]], and [[calcification]]s in the [[vertebral column]], [[femur]], and [[calcaneus|heel bone]] which show a peculiar stippled appearance on [[medical radiography|X-rays]]. [[Dysmelia|Limb abnormalities]], such as [[brachydactyly]] (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur.<ref name=HDT/><ref name=Loftus/> Common non-skeletal features of FWS include [[low birth weight]] and [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]].<ref name=HDT/><ref name=Loftus/>

Warfarin administration in the second and third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are [[central nervous system]] disorders, including [[spasticity]] and [[seizure]]s, and eye defects.<ref name=HDT/><ref name=Loftus/> Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with [[artificial heart valve]]s.

Usually, warfarin is avoided in the first trimester, and a [[low molecular weight heparin]] such as [[enoxaparin]] is substituted. With heparin, risk of maternal hemorrhage and other complications is still increased, but heparins do not cross the placental barrier and therefore do not cause birth defects.<ref name=Loftus/> Various solutions exist for the time around delivery.

==Adverse effects==

===Calcification of arteries===
High doses of warfarin have been found to cause calcification of the elastic lamellae of the arteries including the aorta and the aortic valve in rodents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Price PA, Faus SA, Williamson MK |title=Warfarin causes rapid calcification of the elastic lamellae in rat arteries and heart valves. |journal=Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.| url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/18/9/1400.long}}</ref> Several types of epidemiological studies have also implicated warfarin use in valvular calcification in humans.<ref>[http://slm-respiratory.com/uploads/media/Warfarin_Use_and_Risk_of_Valvular_Calcification.pdf review of animal and human studies]</ref>

===Hemorrhage===
The only common [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of warfarin is [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding). The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a median annual rate of 0.9 to 2.7% has been reported<ref name=Horton>{{cite journal |author=Horton JD, Bushwick BM |title=Warfarin therapy: evolving strategies in anticoagulation |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=635–46 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=10029789 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990201ap/635.html}}</ref>) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered as a therapeutic measure. Risk of bleeding is augmented if the [[International normalized ratio|INR]] is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions), and may cause [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood), excessive bruising, bleeding from nose or gums, or blood in [[urine]] or [[Human feces|stool]].

The risks of bleeding is increased when warfarin is combined with [[antiplatelet drug]]s such as [[clopidogrel]], [[aspirin]], or other [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.<ref name="pmid17698822">{{cite journal |author=Delaney JA, Opatrny L, Brophy JM, Suissa S |title=Drug drug interactions between antithrombotic medications and the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding |journal=CMAJ |volume=177 |issue=4 |pages=347–51 |year=2007 |pmid=17698822 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.070186|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/4/347 |pmc=1942107}}</ref> The risk may also be increased in elderly patients<ref name="pmid17515465">{{cite journal |author=Hylek EM, Evans-Molina C, Shea C, Henault LE, Regan S |title=Major hemorrhage and tolerability of warfarin in the first year of therapy among elderly patients with atrial fibrillation |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=21 |pages=2689–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17515465 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.653048}}</ref> and in patients on [[hemodialysis]].<ref name="pmid17720522">{{cite journal |author=Elliott MJ, Zimmerman D, Holden RM |title=Warfarin anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients: a systematic review of bleeding rates |journal=Am.

===Warfarin necrosis===
{{Main|warfarin necrosis}}
A rare but serious complication resulting from treatment with warfarin is [[warfarin necrosis]], which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment in patients with a deficiency of [[protein C]]. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given [[heparin]] in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin [[necrosis]] and [[gangrene]] of limbs. Its natural counterpart, [[purpura fulminans]], occurs in children who are [[homozygous]] for certain protein C mutations.<ref name="pmid10718793">{{cite journal |author=Chan YC, Valenti D, Mansfield AO, Stansby G |title=Warfarin induced skin necrosis |journal=Br J Surg |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=266–72 |year=2000 |pmid=10718793 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2168.2000.01352.x}}</ref>

Protein S deficiency can be affected in the same way as protein C deficiency is affected.

===Osteoporosis===
After initial reports that warfarin could reduce [[bone mineral density]], several studies have demonstrated a link between warfarin use and [[osteoporosis]]-related [[bone fracture|fracture]]. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly.<ref name="pmid10448778">{{cite journal | author = Caraballo PJ, Heit JA, Atkinson EJ, Silverstein MD, O'Fallon WM, Castro MR, Melton LJ | title = Long-term use of oral anticoagulants and the risk of fracture | journal = Arch.

A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gage BF, Birman-Deych E, Radford MJ, Nilasena DS, Binder EF |title=Risk of osteoporotic fracture in elderly patients taking warfarin: results from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation 2 |journal=Arch.

===Purple toe syndrome===
Another rare complication that may occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is ''[[cholesterol embolism|purple toe syndrome]]''. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of [[cholesterol]] breaking loose and flowing into the blood vessels in the skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple color and may be painful.

It is typically thought to affect the big toe, but it affects other parts of the feet as well, including the bottom of the foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Talmadge DB, Spyropoulos AC |title=Purple toes syndrome associated with warfarin therapy in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=674–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12741443 |doi=10.1592/phco.23.5.674.32200}}</ref>

===Reversal of action===
The effects of warfarin can be reversed with [[vitamin K]], or, when rapid reversal is needed (such as in case of severe bleeding), with [[prothrombin complex concentrate]]—which contains only the factors inhibited by warfarin—or [[fresh frozen plasma]] (depending upon the clinical indication) in addition to [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] vitamin K.

Details on reversing warfarin are provided in [[clinical practice guidelines]] from the [[American College of Chest Physicians]].<ref name="Ansell"/> For patients with an [[international normalized ratio]] (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient. When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.<ref name="pmid12186515">{{cite journal | author = Crowther MA, Douketis JD, Schnurr T, Steidl L, Mera V, Ultori C, Venco A, Ageno W | title = Oral vitamin K lowers the international normalized ratio more rapidly than subcutaneous vitamin K in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Warfarintablets5-3-1.jpg|thumb|3&nbsp;mg (blue), 5&nbsp;mg (pink) and 1&nbsp;mg (brown) warfarin tablets (UK colours)]]

===Pharmacokinetics===
<!--S-Waran redirects here-->
Warfarin consists of a [[racemic]] mixture of two active [[enantiomer]]s—''R''- and ''S''- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways. S-warfarin is more potent than the R-isomer in producing an anticoagulant response.<ref name=Hirsh/>

Warfarin is slower-acting than the common anticoagulant [[heparin]], though it has a number of advantages. Heparin must be given by injection, whereas warfarin is available orally. Warfarin has a long half-life and need only be given once a day. Heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition, [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (an antibody-mediated decrease in [[platelet]] levels), which increases the risk for [[thrombosis]]. It takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug (thrombin has a half-life time of days). Warfarin's long half-life means that it remains effective for several days after it was stopped.  Furthermore, if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover, it can increase thrombosis risk (see below). For these main reasons, hospitalised patients are usually given heparin with warfarin initially, the heparin covering the 3–5 day lag period and being withdrawn after a few days.

===Mechanism of action===
While warfarin is one of several drugs popularly referred to as a "blood thinner", this is a misnomer, since it does not affect the [[viscosity]] of blood.

Warfarin inhibits the [[vitamin K]]-dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of the [[calcium]]-dependent [[clotting]] factors [[thrombin|II]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor IX|IX]] and [[factor X|X]], as well as the regulatory factors [[protein C]], [[protein S]], and [[protein Z]].<ref name="Ansell"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Freedman MD |title=Oral anticoagulants: pharmacodynamics, clinical indications and adverse effects |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=196–209 |year=1992 |month=March |pmid=1564123}}</ref> Other proteins not involved in blood clotting, such as [[osteocalcin]], or [[matrix gla protein|matrix Gla protein]], may also be affected.

The precursors of these factors require [[carboxylation]] of their [[glutamic acid]] residues to allow the coagulation factors to bind to [[phospholipid]] surfaces inside blood vessels, on the vascular [[endothelium]]. The enzyme that carries out the carboxylation of glutamic acid is [[gamma-glutamyl carboxylase]]. The carboxylation reaction will proceed only if the carboxylase enzyme is able to convert a [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] form of vitamin K (vitamin K hydroquinone) to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The vitamin K epoxide is in turn recycled back to vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone by another enzyme, the [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]] (VKOR). Warfarin inhibits epoxide reductase<ref name=Whitlon>{{cite journal |author=Whitlon DS, Sadowski JA, Suttie JW |title=Mechanism of coumarin action: significance of vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition |journal=Biochemistry |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=1371–7 |year=1978 |pmid=646989|doi=10.1021/bi00601a003}}</ref> (specifically the VKORC1 subunit<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li T, Chang CY, Jin DY, Lin PJ, Khvorova A, Stafford DW |title=Identification of the gene for vitamin K epoxide reductase |journal=Nature |volume=427 |issue=6974 |pages=541–4 |year=2004 |pmid=14765195 |doi=10.1038/nature02254}}</ref><ref name="pmid14765194">{{cite journal | author = Rost S, Fregin A, Ivaskevicius V, Conzelmann E, Hörtnagel K, Pelz HJ, Lappegard K, Seifried E, Scharrer I, Tuddenham EG, Müller CR, Strom TM, Oldenburg J | title = Mutations in VKORC1 cause warfarin resistance and multiple coagulation factor deficiency type 2 | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6974 | pages = 537–41 | year = 2004 | month = February | pmid = 14765194 | doi = 10.1038/nature02214  }}</ref>), thereby diminishing available vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in the tissues, which inhibits the carboxylation activity of the glutamyl carboxylase. When this occurs, the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated at certain [[glutamic acid]] residues, and are incapable of binding to the [[endothelial]] surface of blood vessels, and are thus biologically inactive. As the body's stores of previously produced active factors degrade (over several days) and are replaced by inactive factors, the anticoagulation effect becomes apparent. The coagulation factors are produced, but have decreased functionality due to undercarboxylation; they are collectively referred to as PIVKAs (proteins induced [by] vitamin K absence/antagonism), and individual coagulation factors as PIVKA-''number'' (e.g. [[Des-gamma carboxyprothrombin|PIVKA-II]]). The end result of warfarin use, therefore, is to diminish blood clotting in the patient.

When warfarin is newly started, it may ''promote'' clot formation temporarily. This is because the level of [[protein C]] and [[protein S]] are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead to a reduction in activity of [[protein C]] (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of [[factor V]]a and [[factor VIII]]a. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5&nbsp;mg also produce a precipitous decline in [[factor VII]], resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The hemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5&nbsp;mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer [[heparin]], an anticoagulant that acts upon [[antithrombin]] and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Litin SC, Gastineau DA |title=Current concepts in anticoagulant therapy |journal=Mayo Clin.

===Chemical synthesis===
The succinct synthesis of warfarin starts with condensation of ortho-hydroxyacetophenone
(1–2) with ethyl carbonate to give the b-ketoester as the intermediate shown in the [[enol]] form. Attack of the [[phenoxide]] on the ester grouping leads to cyclization and formation of the [[coumarin]]. [[Conjugate addition]] of the [[anion]] from that product to methyl styryl ketone gives the corresponding [[Michael reaction|Michael adduct]] and thus warfarin.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01319a042|year=1934|last1=Blicke|first1=F.

==History==
In the early 1920s, there was an outbreak of a previously unrecognised cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were [[haemorrhaging]] after minor procedures, and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning, and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All of these animals had bled to death.<ref name="Laurence 1973 23.4-23.5">{{cite book|title=Clinical Pharmacology |last=Laurence |first=D.R. |others=Peter Kneebone |year=1973 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh, London and New York |pages=23.4–23.5 |isbn=0-443-04990-4}}</ref>

In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian [[veterinary]] [[pathologist]], determined that the cattle were ingesting moldy [[silage]] made from [[sweet clover]] that functioned as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada since the turn of the century) produced the disease.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schofield FW|title=Damaged sweet clover; the cause of a new disease in cattle simulating haemorrhagic septicemia and blackleg|journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc|year=1924|volume=64|pages=553–6}}</ref> Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result.<ref name="Laurence 1973 23.4-23.5"/> In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning [[prothrombin]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Roderick LM|year=1931|title=A problem in the coagulation of the blood; "sweet clover disease of the cattle"|journal=Am J Physiol |volume=96|pages=413–6}}[http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/96/2/413 PDF (subscriber only)].</ref>

The identity of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 [[Karl Paul Link]] and his lab of chemists working at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] set out to isolate and characterize the hemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6&nbsp;mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named [[dicoumarol]]. They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stahmann MA, Huebner CF, Link KP|date=1 April 1941|title=Studies on the hemorrhagic sweet clover disease.

Dicoumarol was a product of the plant molecule [[coumarin]] (not to be confused with Couma'''<big>d</big>'''in, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like [[Hierochloe odorata|sweet grass]]; in fact, the plant's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of "sweet clover", which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste.<ref name="Laurence 1973 23.4-23.5"/> They are present notably in [[Galium odoratum|woodruff]] (''Galium odoratum'', [[Rubiaceae]]), and at lower levels in [[licorice]], [[lavender]], and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as [[4-hydroxycoumarin]], then further (in the presence of naturally occurring [[formaldehyde]]) into [[dicoumarol]], in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; dicoumarol is considered to be a fermentation product and [[mycotoxin]].<ref>Bye, A., King, H. K., 1970. The biosynthesis of 4-hydroxycoumarin and dicoumarol by Aspergillus fumigatus Fresenius. Biochemical Journal 117, 237–245.</ref>

Over the next few years, numerous similar chemicals (specifically 4-hydroxycoumarins with a large [[aromatic]] substitutent at the '''3'''' position) were found to have the same anticoagulant properties. The first drug in the class to be widely commercialized was [[dicoumarol]] itself, patented in 1941 and later used as a pharmaceutical. Karl Link continued working on developing more potent coumarin-based anticoagulants for use as [[rodenticide|rodent poisons]], resulting in warfarin in 1948. The name "warfarin" stems from the acronym ''WARF'', for ''[[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]]'' + the ending ''-arin'' indicating its link with coumarin. Warfarin was first registered for use as a rodenticide in the US in 1948, and was immediately popular. Although warfarin was developed by Link, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation financially supported the research and was assigned the patent.<ref name="pmid13619027">{{cite journal |author=Link KP |title=The discovery of dicumarol and its sequels |journal=Circulation |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=97–107 |date=1 January 1959|pmid=13619027|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/97 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.19.1.97}}</ref>

After an incident in 1951, where a [[United States Army|US Army]] inductee unsuccessfully attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide and recovered fully after presenting to a hospital, and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote),<ref name="pmid13619027"/> studies began in the use of warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.<ref name="pmid13619027"/>

The exact [[mechanism of action]] remained unknown until it was demonstrated, in 1978, that warfarin [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] the enzyme [[Vitamin K epoxide reductase|epoxide reductase]] and hence interferes with vitamin K metabolism.<ref name=Whitlon />

A conspiracy theory published in 2003 posits that [[Lavrenty Beria]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and others conspired to use warfarin to poison the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. Warfarin is tasteless and colorless, and produces symptoms similar to those that Stalin exhibited.<!--when?

To this day, the so-called "coumarins" (4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives) are used as [[rodenticide]]s for controlling [[rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]] in residential, industrial, and agricultural areas. Warfarin is both odorless and tasteless, and is effective when mixed with food [[bait (luring substance)|bait]], because the [[rodent]]s will return to the bait and continue to feed over a period of days until a lethal dose is accumulated (considered to be 1&nbsp;mg/kg/day over about six days). It may also be mixed with [[talc]] and used as a ''tracking powder'', which accumulates on the animal's skin and fur, and is subsequently consumed during grooming. The {{LD50}} is 50–500&nbsp;mg/kg. The [[IDLH]] value is 100&nbsp;mg/m³ (warfarin; various species).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/Niosh/idlh/81812.html |title=Documentation for Immediately Dangerous To Life or Health Concentrations (IDLHs): Warfarin |author=United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) |date=16 August 1996 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=7 July 2008}}</ref>

The use of warfarin itself as a rat poison is now declining, because many rat populations have developed resistance to it, and poisons of considerably greater potency are now available. Other 4-hydroxycoumarins used as rodenticides include [[coumatetralyl]] and [[brodifacoum]], which is sometimes referred to as "super-warfarin", because it is more potent, longer-acting, and effective even in rat and mouse populations that are resistant to warfarin. Unlike warfarin, which is readily excreted, newer anticoagulant poisons also [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] in the liver and kidneys after ingestion.<ref name=NZToxins>{{cite book |title=Vertebrate pesticide toxicology manual (poisons) |author=Charles T.
