[[File:Skin tanning.JPG|thumb|A suntanned arm showing browner skin where it has been exposed. This pattern of tanning is often called a [[Farmer's tan#Farmer's tan|farmer's tan]].]]

'''Sun tanning''' or simply '''tanning''' is the process whereby [[Human skin color|skin color]] is darkened or tanned. The process is most often a result of exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation|ultraviolet (UV) radiation]] from the sun or from artificial sources, such as a [[tanning bed]], but can also be a result of [[windburn]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} or reflected light. People who deliberately tan their skin by exposure to the sun engage in '''sun bathing''', though there are also artificial tanning methods. Some people use chemical products which can produce a tanning result without exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
Casual exposure to the sun has moderate beneficial impact, including the production of [[vitamin D]] by the body, but excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays has detrimental health effects, including possible [[sunburn]] and even [[skin cancer]], as well as depressed immune system function and increased risk of accelerated aging. To avoid sunburn, most people apply suitable [[sunscreen]] to skin exposed to the sun, but others use oils to accelerate the tanning process.

Some people tan or sunburn more easily than others. This may be the result of different skin types and natural [[skin color]], and these may be as a result of [[genetics]].


Several cases of [[tanning addiction]] have been reported. Though the mechanism by which tanning addiction occurs is unknown, some evidence indicates that the release of [[endorphins]] during the tanning process causes the pleasurable effects that underly the addiction. Because the pleasurable feelings derived from tanning are caused by endorphin release, they are similar to those experienced during a [[endorphins#Activity|runner's high]].

The term "tanning" has a cultural origin, arising from the color tan. Its origin lies in the Western culture of Europe when it became fashionable for young women to seek a less pale complexion (see [[#Cultural history|Cultural history]] below).

==Tanning process==
{{See also|Health effects of sun exposure}}
[[Melanin]] is produced by cells called [[melanocytes]] in a process called [[melanogenesis]]. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin: [[pheomelanin]] (red) and [[eumelanin]] (very dark brown). Melanin protects the body by absorbing solar radiation. Excessive solar radiation causes [[direct DNA damage|direct]] and [[indirect DNA damage]] to the skin and the body naturally combats and seeks to repair the damage and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin's cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens, but the UV-B in sunlight can also cause sunburn. The tanning process can also be created by artificial UV radiation, which can be delivered as UV-A, UV-B, or a combination of both.

There are two different mechanisms involved in production of a tan by UV exposure: Firstly, UV-A radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidises existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin. UV-A may also cause melanin to be redistributed (released from melanocytes where it is already stored), but its total quantity is unchanged. Thus, the effect of UV-A leads to skin darkening, but this is only cosmetic since it does not lead to greatly increased production of melanin and therefore also to little increase in protection against UV-B, or protection against sunburn.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20979596 Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2011 Feb;24(1):136-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1755-148X.2010.00764.x. Epub 2010 Oct 6. The deceptive nature of UVA tanning versus the modest protective effects of UVB tanning on human skin. Miyamura Y, et al. PMID 20979596</ref>

In the second process, triggered primarily by UV-B, there is an increase in production of melanin ([[melanogenesis]]),<ref name=tanning>{{cite web|author=Amy Thorlin |url=http://www.lookingfit.com/ articles/indoor_tanning/729_621feat2.html |title=The Tanning Process |publisher=Lookingfit.com |date=2006-02-05 |accessdate=2009-07-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> which is the body's reaction to direct photodamage (formation of [[pyrimidine dimers]]) from UV radiation.<ref name="Agar2005"/> Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning, and first becomes visible about 72 hours after exposure.<ref name="tanning"/> The tan that is created by an increased melanogenesis lasts much longer than the one that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin, and is also actually protective against UV skin damage and sunburn, rather than simply cosmetic. However, in order to cause true melanogenesis-tanning by means of UV exposure, some direct DNA photodamage must first be produced, and this requires UV-B exposure (as present in natural sunlight, or sunlamps that produce UV-B).

As noted above, the ultraviolet frequencies responsible for tanning are often divided into the [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] and [[Ultraviolet|UVB]] ranges, which will be discussed:

===UVA===
Ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation is in the wavelength range 320 to 400&nbsp;nm. It is present more uniformly throughout the day, and throughout the year, than UV-B. UV-A is not blocked by the ozone layer. UV-A causes the release of existing melanin from the [[melanocyte]]s to combine with oxygen (oxidize) to create the actual tan color in the skin. It is blocked less than UV-B by many sunscreens, but is blocked to some degree by clothing. UV-A is known to cause both DNA damage, and to be carcinogenic. However, it operates not by inducing direct DNA damage, but by producing [[reactive oxygen species]] which damage DNA indirectly. UV-A (see above) apparently induces a cosmetic tan but little extra melanin protection against sun damage, sun burn, or cancer.

===UVB===
Ultraviolet B (UV-B or UVB) radiation is in the wavelength range 280 to 320&nbsp;nm. Much of this band is blocked by the Earth's ozone layer, but some penetrates. UV-B does the following:

* triggers the formation of [[cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer|CPD]]-DNA damage ([[direct DNA damage]]) which in turn induces an increased melanin production<ref name=Agar2005>{{cite journal |author=Nita Agar; Antony R. Young  |title=Review: Melanogenesis: a photoprotective response to DNA damage? |journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis |volume=571 |issue=1–2 |pages=121–132 |year=2005 |pmid=15748643 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.11.016}}</ref>

== Tanning behavior of different skin colors ==
A person's natural skin color has an impact on their reaction to exposure to the sun. An individual's natural skin color can vary from a dark brown to a nearly colorless pigmentation, which may appear reddish due to the blood in the skin. Though subject to variations, ethnic Europeans generally have lighter skin, while ethnic Africans generally have darker skin. In 1975, Harvard dermatologist [[Thomas B. Fitzpatrick]] devised the [[Fitzpatrick scale]] which described the common tanning behavior of various skin types, as follows:<ref>Fitzpatrick TB: ''Soleil et peau'' [Sun and skin].

==Avoiding tan lines==
[[Image:Jeremy beatertan.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Example of tan lines caused by a [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]].  ]]
The wearing of clothing while tanning results in creation of [[tan line]]s, which many people regard as un-[[aesthetic]] and embarrassing. Many people desire to avoid creation of tan lines on those parts of the body which will be visible when they are fully clothed. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to maximize their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, the tanner needs to dispense with clothing; and to maximize covering, they need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For those women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan in the privacy of their backyard where they can at times tan [[nudity|without clothes]], and some countries have set aside [[clothing-optional beaches|clothing-optional swimming areas]] (also known as [[nude beach]]es), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan [[Toplessness|topless]], and others wear very brief [[Swimsuit|swimwear]], such as a [[microkini]]. A recent innovation is [[tan-through swimwear]], which uses fabric which is perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan. Tan-through swimsuits offer SPF protection of about 6, and an application of full-strength sunscreen even to the covered area is recommended.

Because of the potential [[sunburn]] which can result from excessive exposure to direct sunlight, many people suntan in moderation and wear some clothing, including a hat, and use suitable [[sunscreen]]. From time to time they also sit in the [[shade]] or cool off in water.

==Sunless tanning==
To avoid exposure to UVB and UVA rays, or in sunless seasons, some people take steps to appear with darkened skin. They may use [[sunless tanning]] (also known as self-tanners); stainers which are based on [[dihydroxyacetone]] (DHA); bronzers, which are simply [[dyes]]; tan accelerators, based on [[tyrosine]] and psoralens. Some people use [[make-up]] to create a tanned appearance<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/dihydroxyacetone.html| title=Dihydroxyacetone|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-06}}</ref> while others may get a tanned appearance by wearing tan colored stockings or pantyhose.

Many sunless tanning products are available in the form of creams, [[gels]], [[lotions]], and sprays that are self-applied on the skin. Another option is the use of bronzers which are [[cosmetics]] that provide temporary effects. There is also a professional spray-on tanning option or “tanning booths” that is offered by [[spas]], [[Beauty salon|salons]], and tanning businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sunless-tanning/SN00037| title=Sunless tanning: A safe alternative to sunbathing|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-06}}</ref>

Spray tanning does not mean that a color is sprayed on the body. What is used in the spray tanning process is a colorless chemical which reacts with proteins in the top layer of the skin, resulting in a brown color. The two main active ingredients used in most of the sunless tanners are dihydroxyacetone and [[erythrulose]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not approved the use of DHA spray tanning booths because it has not received safety data to support this specific use. DHA is a permitted color additive for cosmetic use restricted to external application. When used in a commercial spray tanning booth, areas such as the [[Human eyes|eyes]], [[lip]]s or mucous membrane are exposed to the DHA which is a non permitted use of the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductandIngredientSafety/ProductInformation/ucm134064.htm| title=Sunless Tanners and Bronzers|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-06}}</ref>

However, recently released FDA data suggests that indoor tanning beds emit 12x more UVA radiation than the sun and has been categorized in the "highest cancer risk" group along with smoking tobacco.

Some researchers have advised that tanning in moderation may be healthier than is commonly believed.  Edward Giovannucci, professor of medicine and nutrition at Harvard, states that according to his research, people who have sufficient vitamin D due to UV exposure, and other intake, may prevent 30 deaths for each one caused by skin cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanning-advisor.com/health-effects-of-tanning.html |title=Health Effects of Tanning and Vitamin D |publisher=Tanning-advisor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  His research also suggests that diet accounts very little for vitamin D<sub>3</sub> necessary for curbing cancer.  [[Michael Holick]], former Boston professor of dermatology, claimed that moderate exposure to sunlight probably reduces risk to many forms of cancer, diabetes, [[seasonal affective disorder]], and other diseases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chetday.com/skincancersun.htm |title=Vitamin D, Skin Cancer, and the Dermatologists |publisher=Chetday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  These researchers are vigorously opposed by most [[dermatologist]]s, for example, Dr. Elewski, president of the [[American Academy of Dermatology]], argued that minutes of exposure to sunlight can be dangerous, and that people can get all the vitamin D they need through supplements.  Large clinical studies have found vitamin D produced both through exposure to sunlight and through dietary supplements dramatically decreases cancer risk, and helps cancer recovery.  See [[Vitamin-D#Role in cancer prevention and recovery|Vitamin D]] for more details.

Throughout history, tanning has gone in and out of fashion.  In Western countries before about the 1920s, tanned skin was associated with the lower classes, because they worked outdoors and were exposed to the sun.  Women went to great lengths to preserve pallid skin, as a sign of their "refinement".<ref>{{cite book

By the early 20th century the therapeutic benefits of sunlight began to be recognised.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=25 August 1900|page=1: An advertisement for a 'German Bath In Scotland' offers 'For Health and Pleasure...Pure Air and Sun Baths...'}}</ref> In 1903, [[Niels Finsen]] was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for his “Finsen Light Therapy”.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://healthsciences.ku.dk/nobelprizewinners/ |title=Nobel Prize Winners in Medicine – University of Copenhagen |publisher=Healthsciences.ku.dk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  The therapy was a cure for diseases such as [[lupus vulgaris]] and [[rickets]]. [[Vitamin D deficiency]] was found to be a cause of rickets disease, and exposure to the sun would allow vitamin D to be produced in a person.

In 1910 a scientific expedition went to the island of [[Tenerife]] to test the wider health benefits of 'heliotherapy’,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=12 March 1910|page=12}}</ref> and by 1913 'sunbathing' was referred to as a desirable activity for the leisured class.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=4 September 1913|page=6}}:Describing a visit by the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]] to the pretty town of [[Sigmaringen]] the reporter says:  ‘The Castle possesses many delightful terraces which could be adapted for sunbathing.’</ref> 

Shortly thereafter, in the 1920s, fashion-designer [[Coco Chanel]] accidentally got sunburnt while visiting the [[French Riviera]]. When she arrived home, she arrived with a suntan and her fans apparently liked the look and started to adopt darker skin tones themselves.  Tanned skin became a trend partly because of Coco’s status and the longing for her lifestyle by other members of society.  In addition, Parisians fell in love with [[Josephine Baker]], a “caramel-skinned” singer in [[Paris]], and idolised her dark skin. These two women were leading figures of the transformation tanned skin underwent, in which it became perceived as fashionable, healthy, and luxurious.<ref>{{cite web

Just before the 1930's Sun therapy became a very popular subscribed cure for almost everything from simple fatigue to tuberculosis.

In the 1940s, advertisements started appearing in women’s magazines which encouraged sun bathing. At the same time, swimsuits' skin coverage began decreasing, with the [[bikini]] radically changing swimsuit style after it made its appearance in 1946. In the 1950s, many people used baby oil as a method to increase tanning.  The first self-tanner came about in the same decade and was known as “Man-Tan,” although it often led to undesirable orange skin.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Coppertone]], in 1953, marketed their sunscreen by placing a [[Coppertone girl|little blond girl and her cocker spaniel tugging on her bathing suit bottoms]] on the cover of their bottles; this is still the same advertisement used today.  In the latter part of the 1950s, silver metallic UV reflectors were common to enhance one’s tan.

In 1962, sunscreen commenced to be [[Sun protection factor|SPF]] rated, although in the US SPF labeling was not standardised by the FDA until 1978. In 1971, [[Mattel]] introduced Malibu Barbie, which had tanned skin, sunglasses, and her very own bottle of sun tanning lotion.  In 1978, both [[sunscreen]] with an SPF 15 rating as well as [[tanning beds]] first appeared.  Today there are an estimated 50,000 outlets for tanning, whereas in the 1990s there were only around 10,000.<ref name="DNRO_20090911">{{cite web

  | quote = The tanning industry has grown about 25 percent over the past six years, according to the Indoor Tanning Association. In the United States, about 25,000 free-standing tanning salons employ 160,000 people and generate more than $5 billion in annual revenue, the association said.

In China, darker skin is still considered by many to be the mark of the lower classes. As recently as 2012, in some parts of China, [[ski masks]] were becoming popular items to wear at the beach in order to protect the wearer's face from the effects of the sun.<ref>{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Dan|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/world/asia/in-china-sun-protection-can-include-a-mask.html|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 August 2012}}</ref>
