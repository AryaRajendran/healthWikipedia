'''Cyclopia''' (also '''cyclocephaly''' or '''synophthalmia''') is a rare form of [[holoprosencephaly]] and is a [[congenital disorder]] (birth defect) characterized by the failure of the embryonic [[prosencephalon]] to properly divide the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] of the eye into two cavities. Its incidence is 1 in 16,000 in born animals, and 1 in 250 in embryos, one in 2,500 that end in miscarriage.<ref>''Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary'', ISBN 0-8036-0654-0</ref>

==Presentation==
Typically, the face is either missing or replaced with a non-functioning nose in the form of a [[Proboscis (anomaly)|proboscis]]. Such a proboscis generally appears above the central eye, or on the back, and is characteristic of a form of cyclopia called '''rhinencephaly''' or '''rhinocephaly'''.<ref>Dark, Graham (2007). [http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?rhinocephaly Rhinocephaly]. In [http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?query=&action=Home ''Online Medical Dictionary'']. Retrieved July 23, 2008.</ref>  Most such embryos are either naturally [[miscarriage|aborted]] or are [[stillbirth|stillborn]] upon [[childbirth|delivery]].

Although cyclopia is rare, several cyclopic human babies are preserved in medical museums (e.g. The [[University of Amsterdam|Vrolik Museum]], Amsterdam).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.uva.nl/index.cfm?pid=2668|title=Vrolik Museum, Department Of Anatomy And Embryology, University Of Amsterdam}}</ref>

Some extreme cases of cyclopia have been documented in inbred farm animals (horses, sheep, pigs, and sometimes chickens). In such cases, the nose and mouth fail to form, or the nose grows from the roof of the mouth obstructing airflow, resulting in suffocation shortly after birth.<ref name="freakyface">{{cite web|url=http://www.messybeast.com/freak-face.htm |title=Feline Medical Curiosities: Facial Deformities |publisher=Messybeast.com |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref>

==Causes==
Genetic problems or toxins can cause problems in the embryonic forebrain-dividing process.<ref name="medterms">{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15530 
|title=Cyclopia definition |work=Medical Dictionary |publisher=MedTerms|date=|accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> One highly teratogenic alkaloid toxin that can cause cyclopia is [[cyclopamine]] or 2-deoxyjervine, found in the plant ''[[Veratrum californicum]]'' (also known as ''corn lily'' or ''false hellebore''). The mistake of ingesting ''Veratrum californicum'' while pregnant is often because [[hellebore]], a plant with which it is easily confused, is recommended as a natural treatment for [[vomiting]], [[cramp]]s, and poor circulation, three conditions that are quite common in [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teratology.org/members/JMFpresentation/tsld011.htm|title=Teratology Society}}</ref> Cyclopia can occur in the womb when [[Holoprosencephaly#Genetics|certain proteins are inappropriately expressed]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/6/11/1847.pdf|title=Mutations in the C-terminal domain of Sonic Hedgehog cause holoprosencephaly|author=Erich Roessler, Elena Belloni,, Karin Gaudenz,, Fernando Vargas, Stephen W.

[[Sonic hedgehog|Shh]] (Sonic Hedgehog Gene Regulator, named after the effects a mutation in the gene had on the forming embryo of fruit flies studied by scientists; a spiky appearance under a microscope, similar to that of its [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|video game character namesake]]) is involved in the separation of the single eye field into two bilateral fields. Although not proven, it is thought that shh emitted from the prechordal plate suppresses [[Pax6]] which causes the eye field to divide into two. If the shh gene is mutated, the result is cyclopia, a single eye in the center of the face (Gilbert, 2000).

==Notable cases==
*A British description from 1665 of a [[Colt (horse)|colt]] apparently suffering from cyclopia reads:

<blockquote>''First'', That it had no sign of any ''Nose'' in the usual place, nor had it any, in any other place of the Head, unless the double Bagg CC that grew out of the midst of the forehead, were some rudiment of it. ''Next'', That the ''two Eyes'' were united into one ''Double Eye'' which was placed just in the middle of the Brow.<ref>{{cite journal

*In 2006, a baby girl in India with cyclopia was born. Her only eye was in the center of her forehead.

*In 2012 (October 10th), a small kitten was born. Its eye was in the center of the forehead and there was no developed nose to be found. The small cat died shortly after it was born. It was nicknamed Cleyed the Cyclops. <ref name=cleyed>{{ cite web|title=

*In 2013 a cyclops Shark fetus was discovered in Mexico, with no discernable nose and one giant eye. The fetus died shortly after birth and was turned over for medical studies.
