The term "poliomyelitis" is used to identify the disease caused by any of the three [[Serovar|serotypes]] of poliovirus. Two basic patterns of polio infection are described: a minor illness which does not involve the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis, and a major illness involving the CNS, which may be paralytic or nonparalytic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Falconer M, Bollenbach E |title=Late functional loss in nonparalytic polio |journal=American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=19–23 |year=2000 |pmid=10678598 |doi=10.1097/00002060-200001000-00006}}</ref> In most people with a [[immunocompetent|normal immune system]], a poliovirus infection is [[Subclinical infection|asymptomatic]]. Rarely, the infection produces minor symptoms; these may include upper [[respiratory tract]] infection ([[Pharyngitis|sore throat]] and fever), [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] disturbances (nausea, vomiting, [[abdominal pain]], constipation or, rarely, diarrhea), and [[influenza-like illness]].<ref name= PinkBook/>

The virus enters the central nervous system in about 3% of infections. Most patients with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic [[aseptic meningitis]], with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, [[lethargy]], and irritability.<ref name=Chamberlin_2005 /><ref name=Late>{{cite book | author=Leboeuf C | title=The late effects of Polio: Information For Health Care Providers. | url = http://www.health.qld.gov.au/polio/gp/GP_Manual.pdf| format=PDF | publisher=Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health |year = 1992 |isbn=1-875412-05-0| accessdate=2008-08-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625212726/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/polio/gp/GP_Manual.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> About one to five in 1000 cases progress to [[paralytic]] disease, in which the muscles become weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and, finally, completely paralyzed; this condition is known as [[Flaccid paralysis|acute flaccid paralysis]].<ref name=Henry1 />  Depending on the site of paralysis, paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal, bulbar, or bulbospinal. [[Encephalitis]], an infection of the brain tissue itself, can occur in rare cases, and is usually restricted to infants. It is characterized by confusion, changes in mental status, headaches, fever, and, less commonly, [[seizure]]s and [[spastic paralysis]].<ref name= Encephalitis>{{cite book |author=Wood, Lawrence D.

[[Image:Polio EM PHIL 1875 lores.PNG|thumb|right|A [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] [[micrograph]] of poliovirus]]

Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a member of the [[genus]] ''[[Enterovirus]]'' known as [[poliovirus]] (PV). This group of [[RNA virus]]es colonize the [[gastrointestinal tract]]<ref name=Harrison /> — specifically the [[oropharynx]] and the [[intestine]]. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days.<ref name=PinkBook/> PV [[pathogen|infects and causes disease]] in humans alone.<ref name=Sherris /> Its [[Virus structure|structure]] is very simple, composed of a single [[sense (molecular biology)|(+) sense]] [[RNA]] [[genome]] enclosed in a protein shell called a [[capsid]].<ref name=Sherris /> In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three [[serovar|serotypes]] of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein.<ref>{{cite book |author=Katz, Samuel L.; Gershon, Anne A.; Krugman, Saul; Hotez, Peter J. |title=Krugman's infectious diseases of children |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2004 |pages=81–97 |isbn=0-323-01756-8 }}</ref> All three are extremely [[virulence|virulent]] and produce the same disease symptoms.<ref name=Sherris /> PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.<ref name= Ohri/>

Individuals who are exposed to the virus, either through infection or by [[immunization]] with polio vaccine, develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].  In immune individuals, [[IgA]] [[antibodies]] against poliovirus are present in the [[tonsil]]s and gastrointestinal tract, and are able to block virus replication; [[IgG]] and [[IgM]] antibodies against PV can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=Kew_2005/> Infection or vaccination with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, and full immunity requires exposure to each serotype.<ref name=Kew_2005/>

[[Image:Polio spine.png|thumb|left|A blockage of the [[lumbar]] anterior spinal cord [[artery]] due to polio (PV3)]]

Poliovirus enters the body through the mouth, infecting the first cells with which it comes in contact — the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] and [[intestinal mucosa]]. It gains entry by binding to an [[Immunoglobulin|immunoglobulin-like]] receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or [[CD155]], on the cell membrane.<ref name=He>{{cite journal |author=He Y, Mueller S, Chipman P, ''et al.'' |title=Complexes of Poliovirus Serotypes with Their Common Cellular Receptor, CD155 | url= http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/77/8/4827?view=long&pmid=12663789 |journal=[[Journal of Virology|J Virol]] |volume=77 |issue=8 |pages = 4827–35 |year=2003 |pmid = 12663789 |doi=10.1128/JVI.77.8.4827-4835.2003 |pmc=152153}}</ref> The virus then hijacks the [[Host (biology)|host cell's]] own machinery, and begins to [[viral replication|replicate]].

Known as [[viremia]], the presence of virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body.

=== Paralytic polio ===
[[Image:PHIL 2767 Poliovirus Myotonic dystrophic changes.jpg|thumb|right|Denervation of [[skeletal muscle]] tissue secondary to poliovirus infection can lead to paralysis.]]

In around 1% of infections, poliovirus spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying [[motor neuron]]s within the [[spinal cord]], [[brain stem]], or [[motor cortex]]. This leads to the development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.

The destruction of neuronal cells produces [[lesion]]s within the [[Dorsal root ganglion|spinal ganglia]]; these may also occur in the [[reticular formation]], [[vestibular nuclei]], [[cerebellar vermis]], and deep [[cerebellar nuclei]].<ref name=Mueller />  Inflammation associated with [[Neuron|nerve cell]] destruction often alters the color and appearance of the gray matter in the [[spinal column]], causing it to appear reddish and swollen.<ref name=Chamberlin_2005/> Other destructive changes associated with paralytic disease occur in the [[forebrain]] region, specifically the [[hypothalamus]] and [[thalamus]].<ref name=Mueller /> The molecular mechanisms by which poliovirus causes paralytic disease are poorly understood.

Early symptoms of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness in the back and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, [[Dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], [[Myalgia|muscle pain]], loss of superficial and deep [[reflex]]es, [[paresthesia]] (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.<ref name= Silverstein>{{cite book |author = Silverstein A, Silverstein V, Nunn LS |title=Polio | series = Diseases and People |  publisher=Enslow Publishers |location=Berkeley Heights, NJ |year=2001| isbn=0-7660-1592-0 |page= 12 }}</ref>

The likelihood of developing paralytic polio increases with age, as does the extent of paralysis. In children, nonparalytic meningitis is the most likely consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases.<ref name=Gawne_1995>{{cite journal | author = Gawne AC, Halstead LS | title = Post-polio syndrome: pathophysiology and clinical management | journal = Critical Review in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation  | year = 1995 | volume = 7 | pages = 147–88 | url = http://www.ott.zynet.co.uk/polio/lincolnshire/library/gawne/ppspandcm-s00.html}} Reproduced online with permission by Lincolnshire Post-Polio Library; retrieved on 2007-11-10.</ref> In children under five years of age, paralysis of one leg is most common; in adults, extensive paralysis of the [[chest]] and [[abdomen]] also affecting all four limbs — [[quadriplegia]] — is more likely.<ref name= Young>{{cite journal |author=Young GR |title=Occupational therapy and the postpolio syndrome | url= http://www.ott.zynet.co.uk/polio/lincolnshire/library/gryoung/otapps.html |journal=The American Journal of Occupational Therapy |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=97–103 |year=1989 |pmid=2522741 |doi=10.5014/ajot.43.2.97 }}</ref> Paralysis rates also vary depending on the serotype of the infecting poliovirus; the highest rates of paralysis (one in 200) are associated with poliovirus type 1, the lowest rates (one in 2,000) are associated with type 2.<ref name=Nathanson>{{cite journal |author=Nathanson N, Martin J |title=The epidemiology of poliomyelitis: enigmas surrounding its appearance, epidemicity, and disappearance |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=110 |issue=6 |pages=672–92 |year=1979 |pmid=400274}}</ref>

==== Bulbar polio ====
[[Image:Brain bulbar region.svg|thumb|right|The location and anatomy of the bulbar region (in orange)]]

Making up about 2% of cases of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when poliovirus invades and destroys nerves within the [[bulbar]] region of the [[brain stem]].<ref name = PinkBook /> The bulbar region is a [[white matter]] pathway that connects the [[cerebral cortex]] to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the [[cranial nerve]]s, producing symptoms of [[encephalitis]], and causes [[Dyspnea|difficulty breathing]], speaking and swallowing.<ref name=Late /> Critical nerves affected are the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the [[vagus nerve]] (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the [[accessory nerve]] (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of [[mucus]] may build up in the airway, causing suffocation.<ref name = Silverstein /> Other signs and symptoms include [[facial weakness]] (caused by destruction of the [[trigeminal nerve]] and [[facial nerve]], which innervate the cheeks, [[tear duct]]s, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), [[diplopia|double vision]], difficulty in chewing, and abnormal [[respiratory rate]], depth, and rhythm (which may lead to [[respiratory arrest]]). [[Pulmonary edema]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] are also possible and may be fatal.<ref name=Guide/>

==== Bulbospinal polio ====
Approximately 19% of all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called respiratory or bulbospinal polio.<ref name= PinkBook /> Here, the virus affects the upper part of the cervical spinal cord ([[cervical vertebrae]] C3 through C5), and paralysis of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] occurs. The critical nerves affected are the [[phrenic nerve]] (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the [[human lung|lungs]]) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a [[medical ventilator|ventilator]]. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.<ref name= Hoyt/>

== Diagnosis ==
Paralytic poliomyelitis may be clinically suspected in individuals experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis in one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or [[cognitive]] loss.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Case definitions for infectious conditions under public health surveillance. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url= ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr4610.pdf |format=PDF|journal= Morbidity and mortality weekly report |volume=46 |issue=RR–10 |pages=26–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9148133 }}</ref>

A laboratory diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]]. [[antibody|Antibodies]] to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally detected in the blood of infected patients early in the course of infection.<ref name=PinkBook /> Analysis of the patient's [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), which is collected by a [[lumbar puncture]] ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of [[white blood cell]]s (primarily [[lymphocyte]]s) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.<ref name = PinkBook/>

If poliovirus is isolated from a patient experiencing acute flaccid paralysis, it is further tested through [[oligonucleotide]] mapping ([[genetic fingerprint]]ing), or more recently by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] amplification, to determine whether it is "[[wild type]]" (that is, the virus encountered in nature) or "vaccine type" (derived from a strain of poliovirus used to produce polio vaccine).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chezzi C |title=Rapid diagnosis of poliovirus infection by PCR amplification |pmc=229102 | journal=[[Journal of Clinical Microbiology|J Clin Microbiol]] |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=1722–5 |pmid=8784577 |year=1996 | month=July}}</ref>  It is important to determine the source of the virus because for each reported case of paralytic polio caused by wild poliovirus, an estimated 200 to 3,000  other contagious [[asymptomatic carrier]]s exist.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink = Atul Gawande |author= Gawande A  |title = The mop-up: eradicating polio from the planet, one child at a time | work = [[The New Yorker]] | issn = 0028-792X | pages = 34–40 | date = 2004-01-12}}</ref>

== Prevention ==

=== Passive immunization ===
In 1950, [[William Hammon]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] purified the [[gamma globulin]] component of the [[blood plasma]] of polio survivors.<ref name=Hammon_1955>{{cite journal |author=Hammon W |title=Passive immunization against poliomyelitis |journal=Monogr Ser World Health Organ |volume=26 |issue= |pages=357–70 |year = 1955 |pmid=14374581}}</ref>  Hammon proposed the gamma globulin, which contained antibodies to poliovirus, could be used to halt poliovirus infection, prevent disease, and reduce the severity of disease in other patients who had contracted polio. The results of a large [[clinical trial]] were promising; the gamma globulin was shown to be about 80% effective in preventing the development of paralytic poliomyelitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hammon W, Coriell L, Ludwig E, ''et al.'' |title=Evaluation of Red Cross gamma globulin as a prophylactic agent for poliomyelitis. 5.

=== Vaccine ===
{{main|Polio vaccine}}
[[Image:Poliodrops.jpg|thumb|right|A child receiving an oral polio vaccine]]

Two types of vaccine are used throughout the world to combat polio. Both types induce immunity to polio, efficiently blocking person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community (so-called [[herd immunity]]).<ref name=Fine>{{cite journal |author=Fine P, Carneiro I |title=Transmissibility and persistence of oral polio vaccine viruses: implications for the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative |url= http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/150/10/1001| journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=150 |issue=10 |pages=1001–21 |date=15 November 1999|pmid=10568615 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009924 }}</ref>

The first candidate [[polio vaccine]], based on one serotype of a live but [[attenuated vaccine|attenuated (weakened) virus]], was developed by the [[virologist]] [[Hilary Koprowski]].

== Treatment ==
There is no [[cure]] for polio. The focus of modern treatment has been on providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include [[antibiotics]] to prevent infections in weakened muscles, [[analgesics]] for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet.<ref name=Daniel>{{cite book |author=Daniel, Thomas M.; Robbins, Frederick C. |title=Polio |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y., USA |year= 1997 |pages= 8–10 |isbn=1-58046-066-6 }}</ref> Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, [[orthopedic surgery]].<ref name=Guide />

Portable [[ventilator]]s may be required to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation|jacket-type]] negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.<ref name= Goldberg />

Other [[History of poliomyelitis#Historical treatments|historical treatments for polio]] include [[hydrotherapy]], [[electrotherapy]], massage and passive motion exercises, and surgical treatments, such as tendon lengthening and nerve grafting.<ref name=Henry1 />

== Prognosis ==
Patients with abortive polio infections recover completely. In those who develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms can be expected to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery.<ref name=Neumann/> In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset.<ref name=Neumann>{{cite journal |author=Neumann D |title=Polio: its impact on the people of the United States and the emerging profession of physical therapy |url= http://www.post-polio.org/edu/hpros/Aug04HistPersNeumann.pdf | format = PDF | journal=The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=479–92 |year=2004 |pmid=15373011}} Reproduced online with permission by Post-Polio Health International; retrieved on 2007-11-10.</ref> Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cuccurullo SJ |title=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Board Review |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?&rid=physmedrehab.table.8357 | publisher=Demos Medical Publishing | year = 2004  |isbn=1-888799-45-5}}</ref> The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of [[viremia]], and [[inversely proportional]] to the degree of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].<ref name= Mueller/> Spinal polio is rarely fatal.<ref name=Silverstein />

=== Recovery ===
Many cases of poliomyelitis result in only temporary paralysis.<ref name=Henry1 /> Nerve impulses return to the formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months.<ref name=Neumann /> The [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sandberg A, Hansson B, Stålberg E |title=Comparison between concentric needle EMG and macro EMG in patients with a history of polio |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=110 |issue=11 |pages=1900–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10576485 |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(99)00150-9}}</ref> Paralysis remaining after one year is likely to be permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.<ref name=Neumann />

One mechanism involved in recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cashman NR, Covault J, Wollman RL, Sanes JR |title=Neural cell adhesion molecule in normal, denervated, and myopathic human muscle |journal=Ann.

Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include [[muscle hypertrophy|myofiber hypertrophy]]—enlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of [[Muscle fiber#Type II|type II muscle fibers]] to [[Muscle fiber#Type I|type I muscle fibers]].<ref name=Agre /><ref name = Grimby_1989>{{cite journal |author=Grimby G, Einarsson G, Hedberg M, Aniansson A |title=Muscle adaptive changes in post-polio subjects |journal=Scandinavian journal of rehabilitation medicine |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=19–26 |year=1989 |pmid=2711135}}</ref>

In addition to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain function in the presence of residual paralysis. These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher than usual intensity relative to the [[Muscle contraction#Contractions, by muscle type|muscle's maximal capacity]], enhancing athletic development of previously little-used muscles, and using [[ligament]]s for stability, which enables greater mobility.<ref name = Grimby_1989 />

=== Complications ===
Residual complications of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process.<ref name= Late /> Muscle [[paresis]] and paralysis can sometimes result in [[skeletal]] deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once the muscles in the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is [[equinus foot]] (similar to [[club foot]]). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the [[Achilles tendon]]s at the back of the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed.<ref name= Aftereffects>{{cite web | author = Sanofi Pasteur | title = Poliomyelitis virus (picornavirus, enterovirus), after-effects of the polio, paralysis, deformations | work = Polio Eradication | url = http://www.polio.info/polio-eradication/front/index.jsp?siteCode=POLIO&lang=EN&codeRubrique=14 | accessdate = 2008-08-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007100336/http://www.polio.info/polio-eradication/front/index.jsp?siteCode=POLIO&lang=EN&codeRubrique=14 |archivedate = October 7, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally.

An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an [[epiphysiodesis]] on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal (growth) plate]] closure, the legs are more equal in length. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful.

While now rare in the Western world, polio is still endemic to South Asia and Africa, particularly Pakistan, and Nigeria respectively. Following the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to [[Eradication of infectious disease|eradicate]] polio began in 1988, led by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], and [[The Rotary Foundation]].<ref name=Watch>{{cite web| last =  Mastny| first = Lisa | title = Eradicating Polio: A Model for International Cooperation |publisher =  Worldwatch Institute | date = January 25, 1999 | url = http://www.worldwatch.org/node/1644 | accessdate =  2008-08-23}}</ref> These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99%; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it has remained at a level of about 1,000 cases per year (1,606 in 2009).<ref name=eradication>{{cite journal |author= |title=Update on vaccine-derived polioviruses |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep]] |volume=55 |issue=40 |pages=1093–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17035927 |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref><ref name=morbidity>{{cite journal |title=Progress toward interruption of wild poliovirus transmission—worldwide, January 2007–April 2008 |journal=MMWR Morb.

The effects of polio have been known since [[prehistory]]; [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] paintings and carvings depict otherwise healthy people with withered limbs, and children walking with canes at a young age.<ref name=Paul_1971/>  The first clinical description was provided by the English physician Michael Underwood in 1789, where he refers to polio as "a debility of the lower extremities".<ref name=Underwood_1789>{{cite book | last = Underwood | first = Michael | title = Debility of the lower extremities.

Before the 20th century, polio infections were rarely seen in infants before six months of age, most cases occurring in children six months to four years of age.<ref name=Robertson_1993>{{cite web | author =  Robertson S | title = Module 6: Poliomyelitis | work = The Immunological Basis for Immunization Series| publisher = World Health Organization.

In developed countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, improvements were made in community sanitation, including better [[sewage]] disposal and clean water supplies. These changes drastically increased the proportion of children and adults at risk of paralytic polio infection, by reducing childhood exposure and immunity to the disease.<ref name=Robertson_1993/>

The polio epidemics changed not only the lives of those who survived them, but also affected profound cultural changes; spurring [[grassroots]] fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical [[philanthropy]], and give rise to the modern field of [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation therapy]]. As one of the largest disabled groups in the world, polio survivors also helped to advance the modern [[disability rights movement]] through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the [[disabled]].

The disease was very well publicized during the polio epidemics of the 1950s, with extensive media coverage of any scientific advancements that might lead to a cure. Thus, the scientists working on polio became some of the most famous of the century. Fifteen scientists and two laymen who made important contributions to the knowledge and treatment of poliomyelitis are honored by the [[Polio Hall of Fame]], which was dedicated in 1957 at the [[Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], US. In 2008 four organizations (Rotary International, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and UNICEF) were added to the Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite news | first=Winston | last=Skinner | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Four added to Polio Hall of Fame at Warm Springs | date=2008-11-15 | publisher= | url =http://www.times-herald.com/Local/Four-added-to-Polio-Hall-of-Fame-at-Warm-Springs-589785 | work =The Times-Herald (Newnan, GA) | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-29 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=CDC Inducted into Polio Hall of Fame | date=2009-01-23 | publisher= | url =http://www.cdc.gov/news/2009/01/polio_hof/ | work =CDC In the News | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}</ref>
