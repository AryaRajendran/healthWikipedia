'''Thomas Edward Radecki''', MD, [[Juris Doctor|JD]] (b. 1946)<ref name="WVBOM">{{cite web|url=http://www.wvbom.wv.gov/licenseSearch.asp?QueueNumber=0&Radio=1&keywordLast=&keywordFirst=a&profession=&Category=NAME&Descending=&CurrentPage=462&TotalPages=642&PageSize=20&IndividualID=9564|title=West Virginia Board of Medicine Licensee Search}}</ref> is an American psychiatrist and founding member of the National Coalition on TV Violence. He is known for his controversial views on the effects of portrayals of violence on teens. Radecki is profoundly against depictions of violence in any form. He has been quoted in numerous books and news articles to that effect.

== Education ==
He attended [[The Ohio State University College of Medicine|Ohio State College of Medicine]], (class of '73<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Radecki|title=Thomas E Radecki, MD|work=Vitals.com}}</ref>), where he received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]. His [[postgraduate education]] was done at the [[Blockley Almshouse#Philadelphia General Hospital|Philadelphia General Hospital]] (06/30/1974) and the [[Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania]] (06/30/1976).<ref name="WVBOM"/>

He received his JD after studies at the [[Oklahoma City University School of Law]] (1995-1996), and the [[Southern Illinois University School of Law]] (1996-1998).

== Career ==

He practiced or was licensed to practice as a doctor in West Virginia (1977-1979) and Kentucky.<ref name="WVBOM"/>

In 1985 Radecki cited a fictitious letter written by a character in the novel [[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|''Mazes and Monsters'']] as "proof" that the game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' had caused the death of gamers.<ref>Hicks, Robert D. ''In Pursuit of Satan: The Police and the Occult'' Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1991; p. 288</ref> In 1987 he testified as an expert on the effects of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' on behalf of [[Darren Molitor]] (convicted of murder in 1985) at an appeal, along with [[Patricia Pulling]]. The court rejected his testimony.<ref>[http://mo.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19870331_0024.MO.htm/qx Missouri v. Molitor, 729 S.W. 2d 551 (1987)]</ref> He also testified at at least 12 other cases, all unsuccessfully.

It later emerged that he was not actually a doctor at the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine]], and that the title was honorary, signifying that he was accredited to practice at a [[teaching hospital]]. His status there was removed in 1985.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In March 1992, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation revoked his medical license for a five year minimum as a result of his "engaging in immoral conduct of an unprofessional nature with a patient".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312826,00.html|title=Down the Tubes|date=Dec 25, 1992|issue=150-151|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>

Radecki resigned from NCTV, turning it over to a colleague, [[Carole Lieberman]]. His request for early reinstatement of his license was later rejected, following complaints about his Surrogate Parenting Institute, a [[fertility clinic]]. His license was later restored in 2002,<ref>{{cite web|title=ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PROFESSIONAL REGULATION DISCIPLINARY REPORT FOR MAY 2002|url=http://www.idfpr.com/Forms/DISCPLN/0205_dis.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2012|month=May|year=2002|quote=Thomas E.

He has advocated for the use of [[Tramadol]] as a replacement of [[Buprenorphine|Suboxone]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Brunk|first=Doug|title=Tramadol appears to stem abuse of opiates|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4345/is_2_36/ai_n29416417/|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=Clinical Psychiatry News|date=Feb, 2008|location=Coronado, Calif.}}</ref>

In September 2012, Radecki voluntarily surrendered his Pennsylvania medical license, while facing allegations of unprofessional conduct with patients. The allegations included claims Radecki traded drugs to patients in exchange for sex. <ref>{{cite web|title=Local doctor accused of exchanging drugs for sex permanently surrenders medical license|url=http://www.wjactv.com/news/news/local-doctor-accused-exchanging-drugs-sex-permanen/nSNd9|accessdate=27 December 2012|work=WJAC|date=September 27, 2012}}</ref>

==Quotes==
He is well known for the following quote:

{{Quote|"The evidence in these cases is really quite impressive.  There is no doubt in my mind that the game Dungeons and Dragons is causing young men to kill themselves and others.  The game is one of non-stop combat and violence.  Although I am sure that the people at TSR mean no harm, that is exactly what their games are causing.  Based on player interviews and game materials, it is clear to me that this game is desensitizing players to violence, and, causing an increased tendency to violent behavior." |Thomas Radecki|<ref>{{cite news|last=Scheele|first=Tim|title=Press Release From Washington About D&D|url=http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=663|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=Computers for Christ|date=05/01/2003}}, also {{cite journal|title=Statistics 2-8|author=Yvonne Peterson|publisher=Exodus San Antonio Occult Awareness Program, P.O.
