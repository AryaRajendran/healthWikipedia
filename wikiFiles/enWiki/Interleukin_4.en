'''Interleukin 4''', abbreviated '''IL-4''', is a [[cytokine]] that induces differentiation of naive helper T cells ([[Th0 cell]]s) to [[Th2 cell]]s. Upon activation by IL-4, Th2 cells subsequently produce additional IL-4. The cell that initially produces IL-4, thus inducing Th0 differentiation, has not been identified, but recent studies suggest that basophils may be the effector cell.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sokol, C.L., Barton, G.M., Farr, A.G. & Medzhitov, R. |title=A mechanism for the initiation of allergen-induced T helper type 2 responses |journal=Nat Immunol |volume=9 |pages=310–318 |year=2008 |pmid=18300366 |doi=10.1038/ni1558 |issue=3}}</ref> It is closely related and has functions similar to [[Interleukin 13]].

Its receptor is the [[Interleukin-4 receptor]].

==Functions==
It has many biological roles, including the stimulation of activated [[B-cell]] and [[T-cell]] [[cell growth|proliferation]], and the differentiation B cells into Plasma Cells.

It is a key regulator in [[humoral immunity|humoral]] and [[adaptive immunity]].  

IL-4 induces B-cell [[class switching]] to [[IgE]], and up-regulates [[MHC class II]] production. It also induces B cell class switching to IgG4.

IL-4 decreases the production of Th1 cells, macrophages, IFN-gamma, and dendritic cell IL-12.

Overproduction of IL-4 is associated with [[allergies]].<ref name="pmid9392697">{{cite journal | author = Hershey GK, Friedrich MF, Esswein LA, Thomas ML, Chatila TA | title = The association of atopy with a gain-of-function mutation in the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor | journal = N.

===In inflammation and wound repair===
[[Macrophage#Fixed_macrophages|Tissue macrophages]] play an important role in chronic [[inflammation]] and [[wound repair]]. The presence of IL-4 in extravascular tissues promotes alternative activation of macrophages into M2 cells and inhibits classical activation of macrophages into M1 cells. An increase in repair macrophages (M2) is coupled with secretion of [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] and [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]] that result in a diminution of pathological inflammation. Release of [[arginase]], [[proline]], polyaminases and TGF-β by the activated M2 cell is tied with wound repair and [[fibrosis]].<ref name="isbn1-4160-3121-9">{{cite book | author = Jon Aster, Vinay Kumar, Abul K.

== Clinical significance ==

IL-4 also has been shown to drive [[mitogenesis]], [[cellular differentiation|dedifferentiation]], and [[metastasis]] in [[rhabdomyosarcoma]].<ref name="pmid21536546">{{cite journal | author = Hosoyama T, Aslam MI, Abraham J, Prajapati SI, Nishijo K, Michalek JE, Zarzabal LA, Nelon LD, Guttridge DC, Rubin BP, Keller C | title = IL-4R Drives Dedifferentiation, Mitogenesis, and Metastasis in Rhabdomyosarcoma | journal = Clin Cancer Res | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 2757–2766 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 21536546 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3445 | pmc = 3087179 }}</ref>

==Structure==

IL-4 has a compact, globular [[protein folding|fold]] (similar to other [[cytokines]]), stabilised by 3 [[disulphide bonds]].<ref name="pmid1993171">{{cite journal | author = Carr C, Aykent S, Kimack NM, Levine AD | title = Disulfide assignments in recombinant mouse and human interleukin 4 | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 1515–23 | year = 1991 | month = February | pmid = 1993171 | doi = 10.1021/bi00220a011| url = }}</ref> One half of the structure is dominated by a 4 [[alpha-helix]] bundle with a left-handed twist.<ref name="pmid1400355">{{cite journal | author = Walter MR, Cook WJ, Zhao BG, Cameron RP, Ealick SE, Walter RL, Reichert P, Nagabhushan TL, Trotta PP, Bugg CE | title = Crystal structure of recombinant human interleukin-4 | journal = J.

==History==
This cytokine was co-discovered by Maureen Howard and William Paul<ref>{{cite journal |author=Howard M, Paul WE |title=Interleukins for B lymphocytes |journal=Lymphokine Res. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=1982 |pmid=6985399 |doi=}}</ref> and by Dr. [[Ellen Vitetta]] and her research group in 1982.  

The [[nucleotide]] sequence for human IL-4 was isolated four years later confirming its similarity to a mouse protein called B-cell stimulatory factor-1 (BCSF-1).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yokota T et al. |title=Isolation and characterization of a human interleukin cDNA clone, homologous to mouse B-cell stimulatory factor 1, that expresses B-cell- and T-cell-stimulating activities |journal=Proc.
