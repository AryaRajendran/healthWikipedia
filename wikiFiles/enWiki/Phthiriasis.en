'''Phthiriasis''' is a common [[eyelid]] infestation, caused by ''[[Crab louse|Phthirus pubis]]'' (pubic lice, sometimes referred to as crab lice).
Pediculosis is an eyelid infestation by either ''Pediculus humanus corporis'' (body) or ''Pediculus humanus capitus'' (head) [[lice]]. The term was formerly used to describe an infestation of lice which would live beneath the skin (see reference). Also referred to as ''Morbus Pedicularis''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=C. Jr.|first=T.
