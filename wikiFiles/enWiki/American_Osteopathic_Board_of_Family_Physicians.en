==Board certification==
Initial certification is available to [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic]] family physicians who have successfully completed an AOA-approved [[medical residency|residency]] in family medicine, two years of practice, successful completion of written and oral exams, and chart review.  

Voluntary recertification was first offered in Fall 1994, and mandatory recertification began in March 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to AOBFP.ORG|url=http://www.aobfp.org/home.html|publisher=AOBFP|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref> Before this time, the initial board certification was permanent and recertification was not required. Since March 1997, if a physician does not recertify every eight years, their board certification status expires.<ref>{{cite web|title=Certificates/Longevity|url=http://www.aobfp.org/cert-long/index.html|publisher=AOBFP|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Osteopathic Family Physicians Society|url=http://www.poma.org/OsteopathicLinks/POFPS/tabid/66/Default.aspx|publisher=POMA|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>
