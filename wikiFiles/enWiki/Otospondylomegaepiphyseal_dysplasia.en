'''Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia''' (OSMED) is an [[recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] disorder of [[bone]] growth that results in skeletal abnormalities, severe [[hearing loss]], and distinctive facial features. The name of the condition indicates that it affects hearing (oto-) and the bones of the spine (spondylo-), and enlarges the ends of bones ([[megaepiphyse]]s). 

The features of OSMED are similar to those of another skeletal disorder, [[Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome]]. Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia is a subtype of [[collagenopathy, types II and XI]].

==Diagnosis==

The distinctive characteristics of OSMED include severe bone and joint problems and very severe hearing loss. This disorder affects the [[epiphyses]], the parts of the bone where growth occurs. People with the condition are often shorter than average because the bones in their arms and legs are unusually short. Other skeletal signs include enlarged joints, short hands and fingers, and flat bones of the spine ([[vertebrae]]). People with the disorder often experience back and joint pain, limited joint movement, and [[arthritis]] that begins early in life. Severe high-tone hearing loss is common. Typical facial features include protruding eyes; a sunken nasal bridge; an upturned nose with a large, rounded tip; and a small lower jaw. Some affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth, which is called a [[cleft palate]].

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Mutations in the ''[[COL11A2]]'' [[gene]] cause otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia. The protein made by the ''COL11A2'' gene is involved in the production of type XI [[collagen]]. This type of collagen is important for the normal development of bone and other [[connective tissue]]s. Mutations in the ''COL11A2'' gene lead to a loss of function of this type of collagen, resulting in the signs and symptoms of OSMED.

OSMED is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene - one from each parent - must be inherited for a person to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are usually not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene. A recessive pattern of inheritance makes OSMED unique among the type II and type XI collagenopathies.

==Epidemiology==
The frequency of this disorder is unknown, but it is very rare. Only a few families with the condition have been reported.
