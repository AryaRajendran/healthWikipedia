'''Virtual reality in telerehabilitation''' is a method used first in the training of [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] patients using [[Asynchrony|asynchronous]] patient data uploading, and an internet video link. Subsequently, therapists using virtual reality-based [[telerehabilitation]] prescribe exercise routines via the web which are then accessed and executed by patients through a [[web browser]]. Therapists then monitor the patient's progress via the web and modify the therapy [[Asynchronous learning|asynchronously]] without real-time interaction or training.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Westwood |first=James D. |coauthors=Helene M.

==Background==
The computer technology that allows development [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] [[virtual reality|virtual]] environments consists of both [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]. The current popular, technical, and scientific interest in virtual environments is inspired, in large part, by the advent and availability of increasingly powerful and affordable visually oriented, interactive, graphical display systems and techniques lacking only sense and sensibility.

The term "virtualized reality" (VR) was coined and introduced in a paper by Kanade. The traditional virtual reality world is typically constructed using simplistic, artificially created [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) models. VR starts with the real-world scene and virtualizes it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kanade|first=T.|coauthors= P.J. Narayanan and P.W.

==Application==
The value of VR systems for the investigation and rehabilitation of cognitive and perceptual impairments and current and potential applications of VR technology address six [[neurorehabilitation]] issues.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Trepagnier | first = Cheryl C. | year = 1999 | month = January | title = Virtual environments for the investigation and rehabilitation of cognitive and perceptual impairments | journal = NeuroRehabilitation | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72 | url = http://iospress.metapress.com/link.asp?id=k3w4811mjpgulujd | accessdate = 2007-07-26 }}</ref> Korean researchers developed and assessed the value of a new rehabilitation training system to improve [[Equilibrioception|postural balance control]] by combining virtual reality technology with an unfixed [[bicycle]].

Tracy and Lathan investigated the relationship between [[Motor skill|motor task]]s and participants' [[Spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial abilities]] by training participants within a VR based simulator and then observing their ability to transfer training from the simulator to the real world. The study demonstrated that subjects with lower spatial abilities achieved significant positive transfer from a simulator based training task to a similar real world robotic operation task.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Tracey | first = M.

Many cases have applied virtual reality technology to [[telemedicine]] and [[telerehabilitation]] service development. Because telemedicine focuses principally on transmitting medical information, VR has potential to enhance the practice. State of the art of VR-based telemedicine applications is used in remote or augmented surgery as well as in surgical training, both of which are critically dependent on [[eye–hand coordination]]. Recently, however, different researchers have tried to use virtual environments in medical visualization and for assessment and rehabilitation in neuropsychology.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Riva | first = Giuseppe | coauthors = Luciano Gamberini | year = 2000 | title = Virtual reality in telemedicine | journal = Telemedicine Journal and e-Health | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 327–40 | doi =10.1089/153056200750040183 | pmid = 11110636 }}</ref>
