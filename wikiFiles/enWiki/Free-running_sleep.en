'''Free-running sleep''' experiments can involve any organism which [[sleep]]s. Free-running sleep is sleep which is not adjusted, [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrained]], to the 24-hour cycle in nature nor to any artificial cycle. Such experiments are used in the study of [[circadian rhythms|circadian]] and other rhythms in [[biology]]. Subjects are shielded from all time cues, often by a constant light [[protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]], by a constant dark protocol or by the use of light/dark conditions to which the organism cannot entrain such as the ultrashort protocol of one hour dark and two hours light. Also, limited amounts of food can be made available at short intervals so as to avoid entrainment to mealtimes. Subjects are thus forced to live by their internal circadian "clocks".

The individual's or animal's circadian phase can be known only by the monitoring of some kind of output of the circadian system, the internal "body clock". The researcher can precisely determine, for example, the daily cycles of [[gene]]-activity, [[body temperature]], [[blood pressure]], [[hormone]] secretion and/or [[sleep]] and activity/[[alertness]]. Alertness in humans can be determined by many kinds of verbal and non-verbal tests; activity in animals by observation, for example of wheel-running in [[rodent]]s.

When animals or people ''free-run'', experiments can be done to see what sort of signals, known as ''[[zeitgeber]]s'', are effective in entrainment. Also, much work has been done to see how long or short a circadian cycle the different organisms can be entrained to. For example, some animals can be entrained to a 22-hour day, but they can not be entrained to a 20-hour day. In recent studies funded by the U.S. space industry, it has been shown that most humans can be entrained to a 23.5-hour day and to a 24.65-hour day.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Scheer |first=Frank A.J.L. |coauthors=Kenneth P.

The effect of unintended time cues is called ''masking''. If morning rush traffic can be heard from outside, if researchers or maintenance staff appear at the same time each day, an experiment can be ruined by masking.

==In humans==
[[Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder]], also referred to as ''free-running disorder'' (FRD) or ''Non-24'', is one of the [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]]s in humans. It affects more than half<ref>{{cite book |author=Teofilo Lee-Chiong |title=Sleep: a comprehensive handbook |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=New York |year=2006 |pages=385 |isbn=0-471-68371-X}}</ref> of people who are totally [[blindness|blind]] and a small number of sighted individuals.<ref name=AASM>[http://www.journalsleep.org/Articles/301108.pdf An American Academy of Sleep Medicine Review: ''Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders: Part II, Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder, Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, Free-Running Disorder, and Irregular Sleep-Wake Rhythm.''] PDF, 18 pages.

Among blind people, the cause is the inability to register, and therefore to entrain to, light cues. The many blind people who do entrain to the 24-hour light/dark cycle have eyes with functioning retinas including operative non-visual light-sensitive cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tu, D.C. |title=Physiologic diversity and development of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=987–99 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16364902 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.09.031 |quote=Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate numerous nonvisual phenomena, including entrainment of the circadian clock to light-dark cycles, pupillary light responsiveness, and light-regulated hormone release. |last2=Zhang |first2=D. |last3=Demas |first3=J. |display-authors=4 |last4=Slutsky |first4=Elon B. |last5=Provencio |first5=Ignacio |last6=Holy |first6=Timothy E. |last7=Van Gelder |first7=Russell N.}}</ref> These [[ganglion cell]]s, which contain [[melanopsin]], convey their signals to the "circadian clock" via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (distinct from the [[optic nerve]]), linking the retina to the [[pineal gland]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Czeisler |first=Charles A. |coauthors=Theresa L.

Among sighted individuals, FRD usually first appears in the teens or early twenties. As with [[delayed sleep phase disorder]] (DSPS or DSPD), in the absence of neurological damage due to trauma or [[stroke]], cases almost never appear after the age of 30.<ref name=AASM/> FRD affects more sighted males than sighted females.<ref name=AASM/> A quarter of sighted individuals with FRD also have an associated psychiatric condition, and a quarter of them have previously shown symptoms of DSPS.<ref name=AASM/>

The term ''free-running sleep'' has occasionally been used by non-scientists to indicate intentional facilitation of the natural sleep/wake cycle. In this context, free-running sleep means that a person chooses to sleep when sleepy and to awaken spontaneously (specifically without an [[alarm clock]] or reference to the time of day). A decision to prioritize a natural sleep schedule over all other schedules can create conflicts with employment and social obligations.
