'''Progressive muscular atrophy''' (PMA), also known as '''Duchenne-Aran muscular atrophy''' and '''Duchenne-Aran disease''' — is a rare subtype of [[motor neuron disease]] (MND) which affects only the [[lower motor neurone]]s. PMA is thought to account for around 4% of all MND cases.<ref name="PMID19307543">{{cite journal |author= Wijesekera LC, Mathers S, Talman P, Galtrey C, Parkinson MH, Ganesalingam J, Willey E, Ampong MA, Ellis CM, Shaw CE, Al-Chalabi A, Leigh PN.|title=Natural history and clinical features of the flail arm and flail leg ALS variants.|journal=Neurology. |volume=72 |issue=12 |pages=1087–1094 |year=2009 |month=Mar |pmid=19307543 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000345041.83406.a2 |pmc= 2821838}}</ref> This is in contrast to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), the most common form of MND, which affects both the [[upper motor neurone|upper]] and [[lower motor neurone|lower]] motor neurones, or [[primary lateral sclerosis]], another rare MND variant, which affects only the upper motor neurons. The distinction is important because PMA is associated with a better prognosis than classical ALS.

==History==
Despite being rarer than ALS, PMA was actually described earlier, when in 1850 French neurologist [[François Aran]] described 11 cases which he termed ''atrophie musculaire progressive''. Contemporary neurologist [[Duchenne de Boulogne]] also claimed to have described the condition one year earlier, but the written report was never found; hence, the condition was once known as "Aran–Duchenne disease" or "Duchenne–Aran disease".<ref name="PMID18299524">{{cite journal |author= Visser J, de Jong JM, de Visser M.|title=The history of progressive muscular atrophy: Syndrome or disease?|journal=Neurology. |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=723–727 |year=2008 |month=Feb |pmid=18299524 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000302187.20239.93}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
As a result of lower motor neurone degeneration, the symptoms of PMA include:
* [[atrophy]]
* [[fasciculation]]s
* [[muscle weakness]]

Some patients have symptoms restricted only to the arms or legs (or in some cases just one of either). These cases are referred to as "Flail Arm" (FA) or "Flail Leg" (FL) and are associated with a better prognosis.<ref name="PMID19307543" />

==Differential diagnosis==
In contrast to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] or [[primary lateral sclerosis]], PMA is distinguished by the ''absence'' of:
* brisk [[reflexes]]
* [[spasticity]]
* [[Babinski's sign]]
* [[Emotional lability]]

==Diagnosis==
PMA is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]], there is no specific test which can conclusively establish whether a patient has the condition. Instead, a number of other possibilities have to be ruled out, such as [[multifocal motor neuropathy]] or [[spinal muscular atrophy]]. Tests used in the diagnostic process include [[MRI]], [[Physical examination|clinical examination]], and [[Electromyography|EMG]]. EMG tests in patients who do have PMA usually show denervation (neurone death) in most affected body parts, and in some unaffected parts too.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Visser J, de Visser M, Van den Berg-Vos RM, Van den Berg LH, Wokke JH, de Jong JM, Franssen H. |title=Interpretation of electrodiagnostic findings in sporadic progressive muscular atrophy. |journal=J Neurol. |volume=255 |issue=6 |pages=903–909 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18484238 |doi=10.1007/s00415-008-0813-y}}</ref>

It typically takes longer to be diagnosed with PMA than ALS, an average of 20 months for PMA vs 15 months in ALS/MND.

==Prognosis==
The importance of correctly recognizing progressive muscular atrophy as opposed to ALS is important for several reasons. 
* 1) the prognosis is a little better. A recent study found the 5-year [[survival rate]] in PMA to be 33% (vs 20% in ALS) and the 10-year survival rate to be 12% (vs 6% in ALS).<ref name="PMID19307543" />
* 2) Patients with PMA do not suffer from the [[ALS#Extra-motor change|cognitive change]] identified in certain groups of patients with MND.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wicks P, Abrahams S, Leigh PN, Williams T, Goldstein LH |title=Absence of cognitive, behavioral, or emotional dysfunction in progressive muscular atrophy |journal=Neurology |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=1718–1719 |year=2006 |month=Nov |pmid=17101922 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000242726.36625.f3}}</ref>
* 3) Because PMA patients do not have UMN signs, they usually do not meet the "World Federation of Neurology [[El Escorial]] Research Criteria" for “Definite” or “Probable” ALS and so are ineligible to participate in the majority of [[Clinical trial|clinical research]] trials such as drugs trials or brain scans.<ref name="PMID19307543" />
* 4) Because of its rarity (even compared to ALS) and confusion about the condition, some [[Insurance contract|insurance policies]] or local healthcare policies may not recognize PMA as being the life-changing illness that it is. In cases where being classified as being PMA rather than ALS is likely to restrict access to services, it may be preferable to be diagnosed as "slowly progressive ALS" or "lower [[motor neuron]] predominant" ALS.

An initial diagnosis of PMA could turn out to be slowly progressive ALS many years later, sometimes even decades after the initial diagnosis. The occurrence of upper motor neurone symptoms such as brisk reflexes, spasticity, or a [[Babinski sign]] would indicate a progression to ALS; the correct diagnosis is also occasionally made on autopsy.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Tsuchiya K, Sano M, Shiotsu H, Akiyama H, Watabiki S, Taki K, Kondo H, Nakano I, Ikeda K. |title=Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of long duration mimicking spinal progressive muscular atrophy exists: additional autopsy case with a clinical course of 19 years. |journal= Neuropathology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=228–235 |year=2004 |month=Sep |pmid=15484701 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1789.2004.00546.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= Ince PG, Evans J, Knopp M, Forster G, Hamdalla HH, Wharton SB, Shaw PJ. |title=Corticospinal tract degeneration in the progressive muscular atrophy variant of ALS. |journal= Neurology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=1252–1258 |year=2003 |month=Apr |pmid=    12707426 |doi=}}</ref>

==Disease or syndrome?==
Since its initial description in 1850, there has been debate in the [[scientific literature]] over whether PMA is a distinct disease with its own characteristics, or if lies somewhere on a spectrum with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], [[Primary lateral sclerosis|PLS]], and [[Progressive bulbar palsy|PBP]]. [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], who first described ALS in 1870, felt that PMA was a separate condition, with degeneration of the lower motor neurones the most important lesion, whereas in ALS it was the upper motor neurone degeneration that was primary, with lower motor neurone degeneration being secondary. Such views still exist in archaic terms for PMA such as "Primary progressive spinal muscular atrophy". Throughout the course of the late 19th century, other conditions were discovered which had previously been thought to be PMA, such as pseudo-hypertrophic paralysis, hereditary [[spinal muscular atrophies|muscular atrophy]], [[myopathy|progressive myopathy]], [[muscular dystrophy|progressive muscular dystrophy]], peripheral [[neuritis]], and [[syringomyelia]].<ref name="PMID18299524" />

The neurologists [[Joseph Jules Dejerine]] and [[William Richard Gowers]] were among those who felt that PMA was part of a spectrum of "motor neurone disease" which included ALS, PMA, and PBP, in part because it was almost impossible to distinguish the conditions at autopsy. Other researchers have suggested that PMA is just ALS in an earlier stage of progression, because although the [[upper motor neuron]]s appear unaffected on clinical examination there are in fact detectable pathological signs of [[upper motor neuron]] damage on autopsy.<ref name="PMID18299524" />

Also, no [[gene]] has been linked specifically to PMA, and the disorder does not appear in the [[OMIM]] database.

In favour of considering PMA a separate disease, some patients with PMA live for decades after diagnosis, which would be unusual in typical ALS.<ref name="PMID18299524" />

To this day, terminology around these diseases remains confusing because in the [[United Kingdom]] ''motor neurone disease'' refers to both ALS specifically and to the spectrum of ALS, PMA, PLS, and PBP. In the [[United States]] the most common terms are ''ALS'' (both specifically for ALS and as a [[blanket term]]) or ''Lou Gehrig's disease''.
