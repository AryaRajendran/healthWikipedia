{{Redirect|MBBS}}

'''Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery''', or in {{lang-la|'''Medicinae Baccalaureus, Baccalaureus Chirurgiae'''}} (abbreviated in various ways, viz. ''MBBS'' or ''MBChB'', ''MB BS'', ''MB BChir'', ''BM BCh'', ''MB BCh'', ''MB ChB'', ''BM BS'', ''BM'', ''BMed'' etc.), are the two [[first professional degree|first professional]] undergraduate [[Academic degree|degree]]s awarded upon graduation from [[medical school]] in [[medicine]] and [[surgery]] by [[university|universities]] in various countries that follow the tradition of the [[United Kingdom]]. The naming suggests that they are two separate degrees; however, in practice, they are usually treated as one and awarded together. In countries that follow the [[United States]] the degree is awarded as [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]].

==History and nature==
The degree is currently awarded in various forms in institutions in [[Australia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Barbados]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Fiji]], [[Ghana]], [[Guyana]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Ireland]], [[Jamaica]], [[Jordan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Malawi]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Samoa]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].<ref name="urlECFMG 2008 Information Booklet - Reference Guide for Medical Education Credentials">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfmg.org/creds/refgde.html |title=ECFMG 2008 Information Booklet - Reference Guide for Medical Education Credentials |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Historically, Bachelor of Medicine was also the primary medical degree conferred by institutions in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], such as [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. Several early North American medical schools were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had trained in [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. University medical education in England culminated with the Bachelor of Medicine qualification, and in [[Scotland]] the [[Doctor of Medicine]], until the mid-19th century when the public bodies that regulated medical practice at the time required practitioners in Scotland as well as England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. Throughout the 19th century, North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the [[Ancient universities of Scotland]] and began conferring Doctor of Medicine rather than Bachelor of Medicine, the first institution to make such a switch being King's College (now Columbia University) in [[New York]].<ref name="urlColumbia University: About Columbia">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/about_columbia/history.html |title=Columbia University: About Columbia |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

In the countries that award bachelors' degrees in medicine, however, Doctor of Medicine denotes a holder of a [[Doctorate#United Kingdom|higher doctorate]] and is reserved for medical practitioners who undertake research and submit a thesis in the field of medicine. Nevertheless, those holding Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery are usually referred to by the courtesy title of "[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]" and use the prefix "Dr", whether or not they also hold a Ph.D. or DSc. The reason is found in a parallel tradition for those who are post-graduate specialists in Surgery; on acceptance into a College of Surgeons, they stop styling themselves "Doctor" and revert to "Mister" (Mr), "Miss" or occasionally "Missus" (Mrs). This curious situation, where an elevation in professional rank is signified by dropping the title of Doctor, came about because historically a "surgeon" was an ordinary workman, usually a [[Barber]], not trained in medicine but performing dissections and surgery under the direction of a gowned academic who was the actual "Doctor".

Despite their styling as two degrees, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery are usually conferred together. At some institutions, such as Oxford and Cambridge, it was possible in the past to be awarded the two degrees in different years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In many countries, the degrees are awarded after an undergraduate course lasting five or six years. In some cases, a graduate in another discipline may subsequently enter a special graduate-entry medical course, reduced in duration to account for relevant material covered or learning skills acquired during the first degree. In some cases the old first year courses (for six year degrees) in the basic sciences of physics, chemistry and biology have been abolished, and that standard has to be reached by means of school examinations before entry. However, in most countries a newly graduated Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery must spend a specified period in [[Internship (medicine)|internship]] before they can obtain full registration as a licensed medical practitioner.

==Naming==
{{See also|Surgeon#Surgeon titles}}
The specific names and abbreviations given to these degrees depend on the particular institution, awarding body or country, and vary widely; this is mostly for reasons of tradition rather than to indicate any particular difference between the relative levels of the degrees, and they are considered equivalent.

If the awarding body titles the degrees in [[Latin]], the degrees are commonly named ''Medicinae Baccalaureus, Chirurgiae Baccalaureus'', ''Medicinae Baccalaureus et Chirurgiae Baccalaureus'', or ''Baccalaureus in Medicina et in Chirurgia'', abbreviated as MB ChB, MB BCh or otherwise. If titled in [[English language|English]], they are named ''Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery'', ''Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery'', or ''Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery'', usually abbreviated as MB BS, and sometimes as BM BS, even though most MB BS-awarding institutions do not use Latin to name their degrees.

Below are described the specific names used, arranged by country.

=== Australia ===
{{see also|Medical education in Australia}}
Most [[List of medical schools in Australia|Australian medical schools]] confer MBBS degrees. However, the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] confers BMed. This degree is equivalent to MBBS and any BMed graduate may practice in any field of Medicine of their own choice including surgery. In Australia, the Doctor of Medicine (MD) was an advanced research degree requiring two years of full-time enrolment, compared to a [[PhD]], which requires three years of full-time enrolment. However, such as the [[University of Melbourne]] and the [[University of Western Australia]], located in [[Perth]] would shifted to [[Doctor of Medicine]] - the postgraduate degree system.

=== Bahrain ===

The Medical University of Bahrain or RCSI-Bahrain, is a constituent university of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and awards its graduates the MB/BCh BAO, the same degree awarded to graduates at RCSI.

=== Bangladesh ===
All [[List of medical colleges in Bangladesh|medical schools in Bangladesh]] award ''MBBS''. The MD is awarded as a postgraduate research degree in select medical colleges, following the medical tradition of Commonwealth countries. In Bangladesh, Allopathic and Alternative Medicine related medical education at the undergraduate and graduate level is provided by medical colleges. The colleges are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, and are affiliated with a university in the respective region. Until the early 1990s, all medical colleges were established by the government. Since then, several private medical colleges have been set up.

=== Egypt ===
All Egyptian medical schools, public and private, award an [[MBBCh]] as the basic medical degree after completion of 6 academic years. Contrary to the US and Canada, an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] is awarded as an advanced research degree, comparable to a [[PhD]].

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
Various abbreviations are used for these degrees in these areas:
*''MB ChB'' are used at the universities of Birmingham, Bristol, Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Keele, Manchester, Sheffield, and Warwick.
*''MB BCh'' is used by the Welsh universities - [[Swansea University]] and [[Cardiff University]].
*''MB, BCh, BAO'' are used at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]].
*''MB BS'' are used at all medical schools currently or previously part of the [[University of London]] ([[Imperial College School of Medicine]], [[UCL Medical School]], [[King's College London School of Medicine]], [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|Barts and The London School of Medicine]] and [[St George's, University of London]]), [[University of East Anglia]], [[Hull York Medical School]], and [[Newcastle University]].
*''BM BCh'' is awarded by the [[University of Oxford]].
*''BM BS'' are used at the [[University of Nottingham]], [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry]] (Exeter Medical School and Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry), and [[Brighton and Sussex Medical School]]
*''BM'' is awarded at the [[University of Southampton]].  Although no degree in surgery is formally awarded by Southampton, this degree is equivalent to the MB ChB, and students may go on to a career in surgery the same as any other graduates in medicine and surgery.
*''MB BChir'' are awarded by the [[University of Cambridge]].

At the [[University of St Andrews]], pre-clinical study leads to the award of a BSc (Hons) degree.  Students then progress to other institutions to complete their MBChB.  At the Universities of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], the preclinical course leads to an additional [[Bachelor of Arts]] (''BA''), degree (upgradable after three or four years to [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]]), after which most students used to go elsewhere (but usually to one of the London teaching hospitals) to complete clinical training. They could then take the degrees of their new university: they used to have the options of returning to their old university to take the clinical examinations, or taking one of the old non-university qualifying examinations. Most students at Oxford and Cambridge now remain in place to take their clinical training.

The [[Conjoint]] diplomas: ''LRCP, MRCS'', and the alternative diploma ''LMSSA'' were non-university qualifying examinations in medicine and surgery awarded jointly by the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians of London]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] and [[Society of Apothecaries]] through the [[United Examining Board]] from 1994 until 1999, when the [[General Medical Council]] withdrew permission. Prior to 1994, the English [[Conjoint]] diploma of ''LRCP, MRCS'' was awarded for 110 years, and the ''LMSSA'' was a distinct and sometimes less-esteemed qualification. These diplomas slowly became less popular among British medical students, but as recently as 1938 only a half of them qualified with university degrees.<ref>{{cite book |first=R Milnes |last=Walker |title=Medical Education in Britain |location=London |publisher=Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust |year=1965}}</ref> The diplomas came to be taken mostly by those who had already qualified in medicine overseas.

===Ghana===
All Ghanaian medical schools award an MBChB as the basic medical degree after 6 academic years. These medical schools are [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]],<ref>[http://knust.edu.gh About Kwame Nkrumah University]</ref> [[University of Ghana]], University for Development Studies and University of Cape Coast

===Guyana===
The [[University of Guyana]] awards ''MB BS''. Other "offshore" United-States-linked schools in the country award the North American MD. Recently, the University of Guyana acquired accreditation by CAAM-HP, establishing itself as a credible institute and teaching standards in comparison with University of West Indies.

===Hong Kong===
The awarding of qualifications in Hong Kong follows the British tradition.
The dual degree is awarded as:
* ''MBBS'' at [[The University of Hong Kong]]; and
* ''MBChB'' at [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

===India===
[[Medical college in India|Medical colleges in India]], accredited by the [[Medical Council of India]], all title the degrees as ''MBBS''. The students complete a course of four and a half years followed by one year of a compulsory rotatory internship before applying for the degree. The course is divided into four parts with the 2nd part lasting one and a half years. Students take an examination at the end of each part. The first part comprises preclinical subjects [[anatomy]],[[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]]. The second part includes [[pharmacology]],[[microbiology]],[[pathology]] and [[forensic medicine]]. The 3rd part is divided into part I and part II comprising [[social and preventive medicine]],[[ophthalmology]],[[otorhinology]] and [[Internal Medicine]],[[General and special Surgery]],[[Paediatrics]] and [[Obstetrics and Gynaecology]] respectively.

The 12 month internship is compulsory to attain both the degrees and registation with the [[Medical Council of India]].

===Indonesia===
In [[Indonesia]], medicine is an undergraduate study. The Bachelor of Medicine program is completed in 3.5 up to 4 years and graduating students are awarded the degree of ''S.Ked'' (''Sarjana Kedokteran'' / Bachelor of Medicine). At this point, the graduate is not yet a doctor, but he or she may choose to work directly as a scientist or other non-clinician professions (usually still health-related). However, most S.Ked graduates will pursue the conventional path, which is to enroll in the [[clerkship]] program for another 1.5 up to 2 years. This makes the total duration of medical school 5 or 6 years. After they finish clerkship, they will take their [[Hippocratic Oath]] and be awarded the title of ''dr.'' (medical doctor, equivalent to M.D. in United States). Graduates who hold this title are licensed and may now practice medicine. Note that this title is written in lowercase "d", as opposed to uppercase "D", ''Dr.'', which in Indonesia refers to a Ph.D.

===Iran===
In [[Iran]], Medical education begins after high school. No pre-med course or Bsc degree is required. The eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam being held every year throughout the country. The entry to medical school is so competitive and only the Students with the highest rank are accepted into medical program. The primary medical degree is completed in 7-7.5 years. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, called "Professional Doctorate in Medicine" validated by the "Ministry of health and Medical Education of Iran". All physicians will obtain licence and medical council registration number from the "Medical Council of Iran" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications. Academically, Degree of "Professional Doctorate in Medicine" is evaluated as Master's degree in Iran and graduates are allowed to enroll in PhD programs directly after obtaining medical degree.

===Iraq===
All [[List of medical schools#Iraq|medical schools in Iraq]] award ''MB ChB''.

===Ireland===
The medical schools in both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]—namely [[Queen's University Belfast]], [[University of Dublin]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]), some constituent institutions of the [[National University of Ireland]] ([[University College Dublin]], [[University College Cork]] and [[National University of Ireland, Galway]]), and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]—award the degrees of ''MB BCh BAO''. The letters ''BAO'' stand for ''Baccalaureus in Arte Obstetricia'' (Bachelor of Obstetrics), a degree unique to Ireland which the Irish universities added in the 19th century as the legislation at the time insisted on a final examination in obstetrics. This third degree is an anachronism which is not registerable with the Irish [[Medical Council (Ireland)|Medical Council]] nor the British [[General Medical Council]] (GMC). The only exception is the [[University of Limerick]] graduate school of medicine which awards ''BM BS'' for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery.

''LRCPI LRCSI'', or simply ''LRCP&SI'', denotes a holder of the historical non-university qualifying [[licenciate]]s awarded jointly by the [[Royal College of Physicians of Ireland]] and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] to students of the RCSI's medical school under the ''Irish Conjoint Scheme''. Unlike the corresponding licentiates awarded by the Royal Colleges in Scotland and England (which were external qualifications), these qualifications are still registerable with the Irish Medical Council, but not with the British GMC. Students at RCSI still receive these licenciates but now also receive the degrees ''MB BCh BAO'', due to RCSI's status as a recognised college of the [[National University of Ireland]]. The RCSI students also received a [[Licence in Midwifery]] (LM) from each college, in the same way that the Irish universities granted BAO degrees, so their qualifications were sometimes expressed as ''L & LM, RCPI, L & LM, RCSI'' or more misleadingly as ''LLM, RCP&SI.''

''LAH'' formerly denoted a licentiate of the now-defunct [[Apothecaries' Hall, Dublin]], and is no longer awarded.

===Jordan===
The ''[[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]]'' ''([[MBBS]])'' degree is awarded in [[Jordan]] after completion of six years comprising three years of [[medical sciences]] and three [[clinic]]al years. Currently, four [[public university|state supported universities]] grant the degree which are:
*[[Jordan University of Science and Technology]]
*[[University of Jordan]]
*[[Mutah University]]
*[[Hashemite University]]

===Kenya===
The national universities with medical faculties in Kenya, namely [[Egerton University]], [[University of Nairobi]], [[Kenyatta University]], [[Moi University]], and [[Maseno University]]  award ''MB ChB''.

[[Mount Kenya University]] awards a different degree, the [[Bachelor of Clinical Medicine and Community Health]].

=== Libya ===

There are two major medical universities in Libya, [[University of Tripoli]] (Tripoli) and [[University of Benghazi]] (formerly Garyounis) (Benghazi).  Both schools award [[MBBCh]].
There is also a credited private university called [http://www.limu.edu.ly/  Libyan International Medical University].

All medical schools in Scotland ([[University of Aberdeen, School of Medicine|Aberdeen]], [[Dundee Medical School|Dundee]], [[Edinburgh Medical School|Edinburgh]] and [[University of Glasgow Medical School|Glasgow]]) award ''MB ChB''.

The [[University of St Andrews School of Medicine]] awarded ''MB ChB'' until the early 1970s, but since the incorporation of its clinical medical school into the [[University of Dundee]], St Andrews now only awards a pre-clinical ''BSc'' or ''BSc (Hons)'', and students go to a Partner Medical School (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, or [[School of Medicine, University of Manchester|Manchester]] where they are awarded an ''MB ChB'' after a further three years' study.

The ''Scottish Triple Conjoint Diploma'' of ''LRCPE, LRCSE, LRCPSG'' (earlier LRCPE, LRCSE, LRFPSG) is an old non-university qualifying examination in medicine and surgery awarded jointly by the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] and [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]], previously through a [[Conjoint]] Board and from 1994 through the [[United Examining Board]]. These qualifications are still registrable with the GMC{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, but permission to award them was withdrawn by the Privy Council of the UK in 1999.

===Uganda===
The five universities in [[Uganda]] which have [[medical school]]s that teach undergraduate courses, namely [[Makerere University]], [[Mbarara University]], [[Gulu University]], [[Kampala International University]] and [[Busitema University]], all award the '''[[MBChB]]''' degree.

===Wales===
Both universities in [[Wales]] that have medical schools, namely [[Cardiff University]] and [[Swansea University]], award ''MB BCh''.

===West Indies===
All constituent countries of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI) confer ''MB BS'', due to the historical affiliation of UWI to the [[University of London]]. There are other medical schools in the West Indies, but these follow the North-American system leading to ''MD''.

==Classification==
Medical degrees differ from other undergraduate degrees in that they are [[professional]] qualifications which lead holders to enter a particular career upon receipt. This is not the case with most other undergraduate degrees, so whilst the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery are [[undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] or [[graduate degree]]s (depending on the institution), they are perhaps more accurately conceptualised as a so-called [[first professional degree]].  Other professions whose qualifications follow a similar pattern include:
*[[Dentistry]]
*[[Education]]
*[[Engineering]]
*[[Optometry]]
*[[Pharmacy]]
*[[Physical Therapy]]
*[[Law]]
*[[Veterinary Medicine]]
*[[Osteopathy]]
*[[Physician Assistant]]

Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery are usually awarded as general/ordinary degrees, not as [[honours degree]]s, and as such the graduate is not [[British undergraduate degree classification|classified]] as for honours degrees in other subjects. However, at many institutions (for example the [[University of Sheffield]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Leicester]] and [[University of Manchester]] in England and the [[University of Dundee]] in Scotland) it is possible for the degrees to be awarded with Honours (i.e. MB ChB (Hons.)) or with Commendation, if the board of examiners recognises exceptional performance throughout the degree course. Very few of these are awarded.

More often, it is possible to study one subject for an extra year for an [[intercalated degree|intercalated honours degree]]. This is usually a [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc), [[Bachelor of Medical Science]] (BMedSci), [[Bachelor of Medical Biology]] (BMedBiol) or similar: at Oxford and Cambridge in England and Dublin in Ireland [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees are awarded. At a few universities most medical students obtain an ordinary degree in science as well: when the University of Edinburgh had a six year course, the third year was followed by award of an ordinary BSc(MedSci). In Australia, The University of Melbourne in Australia offers an Arts Degree (BA) to a medical student on the completion of two extra years of undergraduate study, and Monash University offers a Law degree (LLB); if the optional Law degree is undertaken, on completion of their degree the student may choose to do a one-year internship at a hospital and become a doctor, or spend one year doing articles to practise thereafter as a lawyer. At the University of Nottingham and the University of Southampton, both in England, all medical students on the five year course obtain a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSci) degree without an extra intercalated year. At [[Imperial College London]] and [[University College London]], certain medical students are able to extend their intercalated year to an extra three years, thus temporarily exiting the MBBS course to complete a [[PhD]]. Upon completion of the PhD, the student is required to sit the remaining 2 years of the medicine course in order to receive his/her MBBS degeee. The [[University of the West Indies]], Mona in Kingston, [[Jamaica]] automatically awards a [[Bachelor of Medical Sciences]] (BMedSci) degree to all students who have successfully completed three years of their [[MBBS]] programme.<ref>[http://www.mona.uwi.edu/fms/docs/MBBS%20Regulations.pdf Regulations of the University of West Indies Regarding The MBBS dEGREE]</ref>

==Progression==
Medical school graduates are only entitled to use the courtesy title "Doctor" upon registration as a medical practitioner with the relevant regulatory body in their respective country. Medical graduates are also eligible to sit various postgraduate examinations, including examinations for membership and fellowship of professional institutions, such as [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons]], postgraduate Masters degrees, such as a [[Master of Surgery]] or [[Master of Medicine]] and a postgraduate doctorate in medicine, such as [[Doctor of Medicine]] or [[Doctor of Science]], if earned in Ireland, the UK or Commonwealth nations, and board certification examinations.
