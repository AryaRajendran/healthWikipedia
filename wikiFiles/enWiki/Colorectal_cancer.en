'''Colorectal cancer''', commonly known as '''colon cancer''' or '''bowel cancer''', is a [[cancer]] from uncontrolled cell growth in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] or [[rectum]] (parts of the [[large intestine]]), or in the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]]. Genetic analysis shows that colon and rectal tumours are essentially genetically the same cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cancer Genome Atlas Network | title = Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer. | journal = Nature | volume = 487 | pages = 330–337 | date = 19 July 2012 }}</ref>  Symptoms of colorectal cancer typically include [[Lower gastrointestinal bleeding|rectal bleeding]] and [[anemia]] which are sometimes associated with weight loss and changes in bowel habits.

Most colorectal cancer occurs due to lifestyle and increasing age with only a minority of cases associated with underlying genetic disorders. It typically starts in the lining of the bowel and if left untreated, can grow into the muscle layers underneath, and then through the bowel wall. Screening is effective at decreasing the chance of dying from colorectal cancer and is recommended starting at the age of 50 and continuing until a person is 75 years old. Localized bowel cancer is usually diagnosed through [[sigmoidoscopy]] or [[colonoscopy]].

Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon are often curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely around the body is usually not curable and management then focuses on extending the person's life via [[chemotherapy]] and improving [[quality of life]]. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, but it is more common in [[Developed country|developed countries]].<!--<ref name="GLOBOCAN" />--> Around 60% of cases were diagnosed in the developed world.<!--<ref name="GLOBOCAN" />--> It is estimated that worldwide, in 2008, 1.23 million new cases of colorectal cancer were clinically diagnosed, and that it killed 608,000 people.<ref name="GLOBOCAN" >[http://globocan.iarc.fr/factsheet.asp Colorectal Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide in 2008 — Summary].

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms and signs of colorectal cancer depend on the location of tumor in the [[bowel]], and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body ([[metastasis]]). The classic warning signs include: worsening [[constipation]], blood in the stool, weight loss, fever, loss of appetite, and [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]] in someone over 50 years old.<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by Tadataka Yamada ; associate editors, David H.

Those with a family history in two or more [[Degree of relationship|first-degree relatives]] have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>--> A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]] (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer.<ref name=Lancet10/> Other syndromes that are strongly associated include: [[Gardner syndrome]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Juhn E, Khachemoune, A | title = Gardner syndrome: skin manifestations, differential diagnosis and management. | journal = American journal of clinical dermatology | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–22 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20141232 | doi = 10.2165/11311180-000000000-00000 }}</ref> and [[familial adenomatous polyposis]] (FAP) in which cancer nearly always occurs and is the cause of 1% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Half E, Bercovich, D, Rozen, P | title = Familial adenomatous polyposis. | journal = Orphanet journal of rare diseases | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 22 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19822006 | pmc = 2772987 | doi = 10.1186/1750-1172-4-22 }}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
Colorectal cancer is a disease originating from the [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] lining the colon or rectum of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], most frequently as a result of mutations in the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] that artificially increase signaling activity. The mutations can be [[Hereditary disease|inherited]] or are [[somatic cell|acquired]], and most probably occur in the [[intestinal crypt]] [[stem cell]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ionov Y, Peinado MA, Malkhosyan S, Shibata D, Perucho M | title = Ubiquitous somatic mutations in simple repeated sequences reveal a new mechanism for colonic carcinogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 363 | issue = 6429 | pages = 558–61 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8505985 | doi = 10.1038/363558a0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Srikumar Chakravarthi, Baba Krishnan, Malathy Madhavan | title = Apoptosis and expression of p53 in colorectal neoplasms | journal = Indian J Med Res | volume = 86 | issue = 7 | pages = 95–102 | year = 1999 | pmid = | doi = }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2012}} The most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the [[Adenomatous polyposis coli|APC]] gene, which produces the APC protein. The APC protein is a "brake" on the accumulation of [[β-catenin]] protein; without APC, β-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of genes that are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation but when inappropriately expressed at high levels can cause cancer. While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased β-catenin because of mutations in [[β-catenin]] (CTNNB1) that block its degradation, or they have mutation(s) in other genes with function analogous to APC such as [[AXIN1]], [[AXIN2]], [[TCF7L2]], or [[Naked cuticle 1|NKD1]].<ref name="markowitz">{{cite journal | author = Markowitz SD, Bertagnolli MM | title = Molecular Origins of Cancer: Molecular Basis of Colorectal Cancer | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 361 | issue = 25 | pages = 2449–60 | year = 2009 | month = December | pmid = 20018966 | pmc = 2843693 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0804588 }}</ref>

Beyond the defects in the Wnt-APC-beta-catenin signaling pathway, other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous. The [[p53]] protein, produced by the ''TP53'' gene, normally monitors cell division and [[apoptosis|kills]] cells if they have Wnt pathway defects. Eventually, a cell line acquires a mutation in the ''TP53'' gene and transforms the tissue from an adenoma into an invasive carcinoma. (Sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated, but another protective protein named BAX is.)<ref name="markowitz"/>

Other apoptotic proteins commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are [[TGF-β]] and DCC ([[Deleted in Colorectal Cancer]]). TGF-β has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers. Sometimes TGF-β is not deactivated, but a downstream protein named [[SMAD (protein)|SMAD]] is.<ref name="markowitz"/> DCC commonly has [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] of its chromosome segment in colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mehlen P, Fearon ER | title = Role of the dependence receptor DCC in colorectal cancer pathogenesis | journal = J. Clin. Oncol. | volume = 22 | issue = 16 | pages = 3420–8 | year = 2004 | month = August | pmid = 15310786 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.02.019 }}</ref>

Some genes are [[oncogenes]] - they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer. For example, genes encoding the proteins [[KRAS]], [[C-Raf|RAF]], and [[PI3K]], which normally stimulate the cell to divide in response to growth factors, can acquire mutations that result in over-activation of cell proliferation. The chronological order of mutations is sometimes important, with a primary KRAS mutation generally leading to a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion, but if occurring after a previous APC mutation it often progresses to cancer.<ref>{{cite pmid|15286780}}</ref> [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]], a tumor suppressor, normally inhibits PI3K, but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated.<ref name="markowitz"/>

Comprehensive, genome-scale analysis has revealed that colorectal carcinomas are clearly separable into hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumor types.<ref name="Muzny-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Muzny | first1 = DM. | last2 = Bainbridge | first2 = MN. | last3 = Chang | first3 = K. | last4 = Dinh | first4 = HH. | last5 = Drummond | first5 = JA. | last6 = Fowler | first6 = G. | last7 = Kovar | first7 = CL. | last8 = Lewis | first8 = LR. | last9 = Morgan | first9 = MB. | title = Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer. | journal = Nature | volume = 487 | issue = 7407 | pages = 330–7 | month = Jul | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1038/nature11252 | PMID = 22810696 }}</ref> In addition to the oncogenic and inactivating mutations described for the genes above, non-hypermutated samples also contain mutated  [[CTNNB1]], [[FAM123B]], [[SOX9]], [[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]], and [[ARID1A]]. Progressing through a distinct set of genetic events, hypermutated tumors display mutated forms of [[ACVR2A]], [[TGFBR2]], [[MSH3]], [[MSH6]], [[SLC9A9]], [[TCF7L2]], and [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]]. The common theme among these genes, across both tumor types, is their involvement in WNT and TGF-β signaling pathways, which in turn results in increased activity of [[MYC]], a central player in colorectal cancer.<ref name="Muzny-2012"/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of colorectal cancer is via tumor [[biopsy]] typically done during sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>--> The extent of the disease is then usually determined by a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>--> There are other potential imaging test such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[MRI]] which may be used in certain cases.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>--> [[Colon cancer staging]] is done next and based on the [[TNM staging system|TNM system]] which is determined by how much the initial tumor has spread, if and where lymph nodes are involved, and if and how many metastases there are.<ref name=Lancet10/>

===Pathology===
The [[pathology]] of the [[tumor]] is usually reported from the analysis of tissue taken from a biopsy or surgery. A pathology report will usually contain a description of [[histology|cell type]] and grade. The most common colon cancer cell type is [[adenocarcinoma]] which accounts for 95% of cases. Other, rarer types include [[lymphoma]] and [[squamous cell carcinoma]].

Cancers on the right side (ascending colon and [[cecum]]) tend to be exophytic, that is, the tumour grows outwards from one location in the bowel wall. This very rarely causes obstruction of [[feces]], and presents with symptoms such as [[anemia]]. Left-sided tumours tend to be circumferential, and can obstruct the bowel much like a napkin ring which can present with thinner calibre stools.

Adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the colorectal mucosa. It invades the wall, infiltrating the [[muscularis mucosae]], the [[submucosa]] and thence the muscularis propria. Tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma ("back to back" aspect).
Sometimes, tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which invades the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically "empty" spaces) - ''mucinous (colloid)'' adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the periphery - "[[signet-ring cell]]." Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism, and mucosecretion of the predominant pattern, adenocarcinoma may present three degrees of differentiation: well, moderately, and poorly differentiated.<ref>[http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/moderatelly-differentiated-adenocarcinoma-colon-gastrointestinal-pathology.php Pathology atlas]</ref>

Most colorectal cancer tumors are thought to be [[cyclooxygenase-2]] (COX-2) positive.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This enzyme is generally not found in healthy colon tissue, but is thought to fuel abnormal cell growth.

==Prevention==
Most colorectal cancers should be preventable, through increased surveillance, improved lifestyle, and, probably, the use of dietary chemopreventative agents {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

===Lifestyle===
Current dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer include increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of [[red meat]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Campos FG, Logullo Waitzberg, AG, Kiss, DR, Waitzberg, DL, Habr-Gama, A, Gama-Rodrigues, J | title = Diet and colorectal cancer: current evidence for etiology and prevention. | journal = Nutricion hospitalaria : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Nutricion Parenteral y Enteral | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–25 | year = 2005 | month = Jan | pmid = 15762416 | doi =}}</ref><ref name=Gast07/> The evidence for fiber and fruits and vegetables however is poor.<ref name=Gast07>{{cite journal | author = Doyle VC, Logullo Waitzberg, AG, Kiss, DR, Waitzberg, DL, Habr-Gama, A, Gama-Rodrigues, J | title = Nutrition and colorectal cancer risk: a literature review. | journal = Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 178-82; quiz 182-3 | year = 2007| month = May | pmid = 17568255 | doi = 10.1097/01.SGA.0000278165.05435.c0 }}</ref> [[Physical activity]] can moderately reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harriss DJ, Atkinson, G, Batterham, A, George, K, Cable, NT, Reilly, T, Haboubi, N, Renehan, AG, Colorectal Cancer, Lifestyle, Exercise And Research, Group | title = Lifestyle factors and colorectal cancer risk (2): a systematic review and meta-analysis of associations with leisure-time physical activity. | journal = Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 689–701 | year = 2009 | month = Sep | pmid = 19207713 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2009.01767.x }}</ref>

===Screening===
More than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from [[adenomatous polyps]] making this cancer amenable to screening.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>-->  Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2–3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.<ref name=Lancet10/> Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.<ref name=Screen11/>

The three main screening tests are [[fecal occult blood]] testing, [[flexible sigmoidoscopy]] and [[colonoscopy]].<ref name=Lancet10/> Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the [[Colon_(anatomy)#Right_and_Left_Colon|right side of the colon]] where 42% of malignancies are found.<ref name='Siegel2012Intro'>{{cite journal | title = Trends in Colorectal Cancer Incidence Rates in the United States by Tumor Location and Stage, 1992–2008 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | date = Mar 2012 | authors = Siegel RL, Ward EM, Jemal A | volume = 21 | issue = 3 |  at = 411–6 (See Introduction) | id =  | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-1020 | url =http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/21/3/411.long | accessdate = 2012-09-16 | pmid=22219318}}</ref> [[Virtual colonoscopy]] via a [[CT scan]] appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths like standard colonoscopy can.<ref name=Lancet10/>

A new screening method is the [[M2-PK Test]]. The enzyme biomarker M2-PK has been identified as a key enzyme in colorectal cancers and polyps. M2-PK does not depend on blood in the stool and is specifically related to changes in the tumour metabolism. It does not require any special preparation prior to testing. Only a small stool sample is needed. M2-PK features a high sensitivity for colorectal cancer and polyps and is able to detect bleeding and non-bleeding colorectal cancer and polyps.<ref>C. Tonus, M. Sellinger u. a.: Faecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 for colorectal cancer screening: A meta-analysis. In: World journal of gastroenterology : WJG.

==Management==
The treatment of colorectal cancer depends on how advanced it is.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Stein A, Atanackovic, D, Bokemeyer, C | title = Current standards and new trends in the primary treatment of colorectal cancer. | journal = European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990) | volume = 47 Suppl 3 | issue = | pages = S312-4 | year = 2011 | month = Sep | pmid = 21943995 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-8049(11)70183-6 }}</ref> When colorectal cancer is caught early surgery can be curative.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>--> However, when it is detected at later stages ([[metastasis|metastases]] are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed more at extending life and keeping people comfortable.<ref name=Lancet10/>

===Surgery===
For people with localized cancer the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with the attempt of achieving a cure.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> This can either be done by an open [[laparotomy]] or sometimes [[laparoscopic]]ally.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs they may also be removed.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> Sometimes [[chemotherapy]] is used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> The two most common sites of recurrence if it occurs is in the liver and lungs.<ref name=Lancet10/>

===Chemotherapy===
[[Chemotherapy]] may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases<ref name=Lancet10/> as [[adjuvant therapy]]. If cancer has entered the [[lymph nodes]], adding the chemotherapy agents [[fluorouracil]] or [[capecitabine]] increases life expectancy.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial.<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then [[palliative]].<!-- <ref name=Lancet10/> --> Typically in this case, a couple of different chemotherapy medications are used.<ref name=Lancet10/> Chemotherapy drugs may include [[Chemotherapy regimens|combinations of agents]] including [[fluorouracil]], [[capecitabine]], [[Tegafur-Uracil|UFT]], [[leucovorin]], [[irinotecan]], or [[oxaliplatin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer |journal=Prescrire Int |volume=19 |issue=109 |pages=219–24 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=21180382 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Radiation===
While a combination of [[radiation]] and chemotherapy may be useful for [[rectal cancer]],<ref name=Lancet10/> its use in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.<ref>{{cite book|last=authors|first=editors, Vincent T.

===Palliative care===
In people with incurable colorectal cancer, [[palliative care]] can be considered for improving [[quality of life]]. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wasserberg N, Kaufman HS | title = Palliation of colorectal cancer | journal = Surg Oncol | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–310 | year = 2007 | month = December | pmid = 17913495 | doi = 10.1016/j.suronc.2007.08.008 }}</ref> Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Amersi F, Stamos MJ, Ko CY | title = Palliative care for colorectal cancer | journal = Surg.

==Prognosis==
In Europe the five-year survival for colorectal cancer is less than 60%.<!--<ref name=Lancet10/>--> In the [[developed world]] about a third of people who get the disease die from it.<ref name=Lancet10/>

Survival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early stage detection is about 5 times that of late stage cancers. For example, patients with a tumor that has not breached the [[muscularis mucosa]] (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have an average 5-year survival of 100%, while those with an invasive cancer, i.e. T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) cancer have an average 5-year survival of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor, yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average 5-year survival of approximately 70%. Patients with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average 5-year survival of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have an average 5-year survival of approximately 5%.<ref name=agabegi2nd>Box 3-1, Page 107 in: {{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

According to the American Cancer Society statistics in 2006,<ref>http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PRO/content/PRO_1_1_Cancer_Statistics_2006_Presentation.asp</ref> over 20% of patients present with metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis, and up to 25% of this group will have isolated liver metastasis that is potentially resectable. Lesions which undergo curative resection have demonstrated 5-year survival outcomes now exceeding 50%.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Simmonds PC, Primrose JN, Colquitt JL, Garden OJ, Poston GJ, Rees M | title = Surgical resection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: A systematic review of published studies | journal = Br.

===Follow-up===
The aims of follow-up are to diagnose, in the earliest possible stage, any metastasis or tumors that develop later, but did not originate from the original cancer (metachronous lesions).

The U.S. [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] and [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.<ref name="NCCNguidelines">[http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/colon.pdf NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology - Colon Cancer (version 1, 2008: September 19, 2007).]</ref><ref name="ASCOguidelines">{{cite journal | author = Desch CE, Benson AB 3rd, Somerfield MR, ''et al.''; American Society of Clinical Oncology | title = Colorectal cancer surveillance: 2005 update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guideline | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 23 | issue = 33 | pages = 8512–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16260687 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.0063 }}</ref> A [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]] are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. [[Carcinoembryonic antigen]] blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for patients with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A [[Computed tomography|CT-scan]] of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for patients who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, patients who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A [[colonoscopy]] can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.

Routine [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] or [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound scanning]], [[chest X-ray]]s, [[complete blood count]] or [[liver function tests]] are not recommended.<ref name="NCCNguidelines"/><ref name="ASCOguidelines"/> These guidelines are based on recent meta-analyses showing intensive surveillance and close follow-up can reduce the 5-year mortality rate from 37% to 30%.<ref name="Cochrane2002">{{cite journal | author = Jeffery M, Hickey BE, Hider PN | title = Follow-up strategies for patients treated for non-metastatic colorectal cancer | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 1 | pages = CD002200 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11869629 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002200 }}</ref><ref name="BMJfollowup">{{cite journal | author = Renehan AG, Egger M, Saunders MP, O'Dwyer ST | title = Impact on survival of intensive follow up after curative resection for colorectal cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials | journal = BMJ | volume = 324 | issue = 7341 | pages = 831–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11934773 | pmc = 100789 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.324.7341.813 }}</ref><ref name="BMCCancerFollowup">{{cite journal | author = Figueredo A, Rumble RB, Maroun J, ''et al.''; Gastrointestinal Cancer Disease Site Group of Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-based Care | title = Follow-up of patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer: a practice guideline | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 26 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14529575 | pmc = 270033 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-3-26 }}</ref>

When considering expanding this list, please remember these four points:

1. There is an article [[List of Notable people diagnosed with colorectal cancer]] where you can list their names
2. This is a relatively common disease, and we can't have a laundry list of every possible "celebrity" with it.
3. We must have solid reliable sources that confirm that the person had this disease. If you add a name without a source, you should expect it to be removed.
4. In particular, listing people that spoke out to help publicise the disease, early detection, and intervention is encouraged.
