While genetic influences are important to understanding [[obesity]], they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yach D, Stuckler D, Brownell KD |title=Epidemiologic and economic consequences of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes |journal=Nat. Med. |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=62–6 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16397571 |doi=10.1038/nm0106-62 |url=}}</ref> It is accepted that calorie consumption in excess of calorie expenditure leads to obesity, however what has caused shifts in these two factors on a global scale is much debated.

Changing rates of obesity are related to a number of social phenomena including: social class, smoking status, number of children people have, and urbanization.

==Social class==
''See Also'' : [[Social determinants of health in poverty]]

The correlation between [[social class]] and [[Body mass index|BMI]] varies globally. A review in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese. No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes. In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sobal J, Stunkard AJ |title=Socioeconomic status and obesity: A review of the literature |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=260–75 |year=1989 |month=March |pmid=2648443 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.2.260}}</ref> An update of this review carried out in 2007 found the same relationships, but they were weaker. The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of [[globalization]].<ref name=McLaren2007>{{cite journal |author=McLaren L |title=Socioeconomic status and obesity |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=29 |issue= |pages=29–48 |year=2007 |pmid=17478442 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxm001}}</ref>

Many explanations have been put forth for associations between BMI and social class. It is thought that in developed countries, the wealthy are able to afford more nutritious food, they are under greater social pressure to remain slim, and have more opportunities along with greater expectations for [[physical fitness]]. In [[undeveloped countries]] the ability to afford food, high energy expenditure with physical labor, and cultural values favoring a larger body size are believed to contribute to the observed patterns.<ref name=McLaren2007/> Attitudes toward body mass held by people in one's life may also play a role in obesity. A correlation in BMI changes over time has been found between friends, siblings, and spouses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christakis NA, [[James H. Fowler|Fowler JH]] |title=The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network over 32 Years |journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume=357 |issue=4 |pages=370–379 |year=2007 |pmid=17652652 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa066082}}</ref>

==Smoking==
Those who quit smoking gain an average of 4.4&nbsp;kilograms (9.7&nbsp;lb) for men and 5.0&nbsp;kilograms (11.0&nbsp;lb) for women over ten years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Flegal KM, Troiano RP, Pamuk ER, Kuczmarski RJ, Campbell SM |title=The influence of smoking cessation on the prevalence of overweight in the United States |journal=N.

==Early malnutrition==
[[Malnutrition]] in early life is believed to play a role in the rising rates of obesity in the [[developing world]].<ref name=DC2001>{{cite journal |author=Caballero B |title=Introduction. Symposium: Obesity in developing countries: biological and ecological factors |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=131 |issue=3 |pages=866S–870S |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11238776 |doi= |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11238776}}</ref>  Endocrine
changes that occur during periods of malnutrition may promote the storage of fat once more calories become available.<ref name=DC2001/>

==Number of children==
In the United States the number of children a person has had is related to their risk of obesity. A woman's risk of obesity increases by 7% per child, while a man's risk increases by 4% per child.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weng HH, Bastian LA, Taylor DH, Moser BK, Ostbye T |title=Number of children associated with obesity in middle-aged women and men: results from the health and retirement study |journal=J Womens Health (Larchmt) |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=85–91 |year=2004 |pmid=15006281 |doi=10.1089/154099904322836492}}</ref>  This could be partly explained by the fact that having dependent children decreases physical activity in Western parents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bellows-Riecken KH, Rhodes RE |title=A birth of inactivity?

==Urbanization==
In the developing world [[urbanization]] is playing a role in increasing rate of obesity.  In China, overall rates of obesity are below 5%. However, in some cities, rates of obesity are greater than 20%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfs_obesity.pdf |title=Obesity and Overweight |format=PDF |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=February 22, 2009}}</ref>
