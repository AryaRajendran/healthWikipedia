'''Microcephaly''' is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]. It is an important neurologic sign but there is nonuniformity in the definition of microcephaly.  It is usually defined as a head circumference (HC) more than 2 [[standard deviation]] below the mean for age and gender.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leviton |first=A. |last2=Holmes |first2=L.

The disorder may stem from a wide variety of conditions that cause abnormal growth of the brain, or from syndromes associated with chromosomal abnormalities. A [[homozygous#Homozygous|homozygous]] mutation in one of the ''[[microcephalin]]'' genes causes primary microcephaly.

In general, life expectancy for individuals with microcephaly is reduced and the prognosis for normal brain function is poor. The prognosis varies depending on the presence of associated abnormalities.

==Causes==

Microcephaly is a type of [[cephalic disorder]].

It has been classified in two types based on the onset:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ashwal |first=S. |last2=Michelson |first2=D. |last3=Plawner |first3=L. |last4=Dobyns |first4=W.

A genetic factor may play a role in causing some cases of microcephaly. Relations have been found between [[autism]], duplications of chromosomes and [[macrocephaly]] on one side. On the other side a relation has been found between [[schizophrenia]], deletions of chromosomes and microcephaly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crespi B, Stead P, Elliot M |title=Evolution in health and medicine Sackler colloquium: Comparative genomics of autism and schizophrenia |journal=Proc.

===Microencephaly===
"Microcephaly" means "small head" (literal translation from the Greek "μικρό κεφάλι"). "Microencephaly" means "small brain". Because the size of the head is mostly determined by the size of the brain, microencephaly is implied when discussing microcephaly.<ref name="WeaverBrandt1999">{{cite book|author1=David D. Weaver|author2=Ira K. Brandt|title=Catalog of prenatally diagnosed conditions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m2Mx9KyY-igC&pg=PA104|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6044-7|page=104}}</ref>

After the dropping of [[atomic bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and Nagasaki, several women close to [[ground zero]] who had been pregnant at the time gave birth to children with microcephaly.<ref>[http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/hiroshima_e/sadako_e/subcontents_e/13kousyougai_1_e.html# Hiroshima Peace Site]</ref> Microcephaly prevalence was 7 out of a group of 11 pregnant women at 11–17 weeks of [[gestation]] who survived the blast at less than 1.2&nbsp;km from ground zero. Due to their proximity to the bomb, the pregnant women's [[in utero]] children received a [[relative biological effectiveness|biologically significant radiation dosage]] that was relatively high due to the massive [[neutron]] output of the lower explosive-yielding [[Little Boy]].<ref name="books.google.ie">[http://books.google.ie/books?id=DykKlVU0V-oC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=microcephaly+hiroshima&source=bl&ots=eqT78xHiCX&sig=9bckWb7x6IsnUC6lhvsa_QTfZ04&hl=en&ei=OGtqTsG9NYTX8gOL3cwk&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=microcephaly%20hiroshima&f=false Teratology in the Twentieth Century Plus Ten]</ref> Microcephaly is the only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the children of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<ref name="books.google.ie"/>

==Presentation==
Affected newborns generally have striking neurological defects and seizures. Severely impaired intellectual development is common, but disturbances in motor functions may not appear until later in life.

[[Infant]]s with microcephaly are born with either a normal or reduced head size. Subsequently the head fails to grow while the face continues to develop at a normal rate, producing a child with a small head and a receding forehead, and a loose, often wrinkled scalp. As the child grows older, the smallness of the [[human skull|skull]] becomes more obvious, although the entire body also is often underweight and dwarfed. Development of motor functions and [[Speech communication|speech]] may be delayed. Hyperactivity and Intellectual Disability are common occurrences, although the degree of each varies. Convulsions may also occur. Motor ability varies, ranging from clumsiness in some to spastic [[quadriplegia]] in others.

==Prognosis==
Generally there is no specific treatment for microcephaly. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

==History==
Microcephalics were sometimes sold to [[freak shows]] in North America and Europe in the 19th and early 20th century, where they were known by the name "pinheads". Many of them were presented as different species (e.g., "monkey man") and described as being the [[Transitional fossil|missing link]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mateen FJ, Boes CJ |title="Pinheads": the exhibition of neurologic disorders at "The Greatest Show on Earth" | journal= Neurology | volume=30 | pages=2028–32 | pmid=21115959 | doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181ff9636}}</ref> Famous examples are [[Zip the Pinhead]] (although he may not have had microcephaly)<ref>"[http://thehumanmarvels.com/36/the-pinhead-what-is-it/pinhead]?" 16 October 2010.</ref> and [[Schlitzie]] the Pinhead,<ref>"[http://thehumanmarvels.com/130/schlitzie-the-pinhead/pinhead]?" 16 October 2010.</ref> who also starred in the 1932 movie [[Freaks]]. Both these individuals were cited as influences on the development of the long-running [[comic strip]] character [[Zippy the Pinhead]], created by [[Bill Griffith]].<ref>[http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaishehavingfunyet.html Interview with Bill Griffith, Goblin Magazine 1995], transcribed on zippythepinhead.com; accessed Feb. 13, 2013</ref>

==Notable microcephalic persons==
* [[Schlitzie]], a circus performer best known for his role in the 1932 film ''[[Freaks]]''.
* [[Beetlejuice (entertainer)|Beetlejuice]], a member of [[The Howard Stern Show|Howard Stern's]] "[[Wack Pack]]".
* [[Zip the Pinhead]] (Circus "[[freak show]]" performer William Henry Johnson) is commonly associated with microcephaly, although he may not have actually had it.
* [[Triboulet]] was a [[jester]] of kings [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] of [[France]].  He appears in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Le Roi s'amuse]]'' and its opera version, [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]''.
