'''World Hepatitis Day''', observed on July 28 every year, aims to raise global awareness of [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]] and encourage prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

Approximately 500 million people worldwide are living with either hepatitis B or hepatitis C.<ref>http://www.elpa-info.org/index.php/general-news---reader/items/id-500-million-people-await-world-health-assembly-decision-on-viral-hepatitis.htm</ref> If left untreated and unmanaged, hepatitis B or C can lead to advanced liver scarring ([[cirrhosis]]) and other complications, including [[liver cancer]] or [[liver failure]]. While many people worry more about contracting [[AIDS]] than hepatitis, the reality is that every year 1.5 million people worldwide die from either hepatitis B or C faster than they would from HIV/AIDS.<ref name="url">{{cite press release|title=World Hepatitis Alliance Calls on Governments to Take Urgent Action to Tackle Chronic Viral Hepatitis B & C Epidemic; 2008|url=http://www.aminumber12.org/Content/PDF/news_0004.pdf|work=World Hepatitis Day: Home Page|publisher=World Hepatitis Alliance|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

Hepatitis groups, patients and advocates worldwide take part in events on 28th July to mark the occasion. Notably in 2012, a Guinness World Record was created when 12,588 people from 20 countries did the [[Three Wise Monkeys]] actions on World Hepatitis Day to signify the willful ignorance of the disease. 

==History==
The inaugural International Hepatitis C Awareness day, coordinated by various European and Middle Eastern Patient Groups, took place October 1, 2004,<ref>http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=131262</ref> however many patient groups continued to mark 'hepatitis day' on disparate dates.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-14108332_ITM | work=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire | title=Roche Pakistan to sponsor Hepatitis C awareness campaign | date=2004-10-21}}</ref> 

'Am I number 12' was maintained as the theme for the 2009 World Hepatitis Day, with many alliance members also creating a hepatitis themed '12 asks of government'.<ref>http://www.hepatitisaustralia.com/events_projects/WorldHepatitisDay20092.html</ref>

In 2013 the ‘This is hepatitis’ theme has been evolved to ‘This is '''hepatitis'''… Know it. Confront it.’ The new slogan encourages people to recognise how prevalent the condition is. It also challenges people to take steps to increase their own awareness, but also the priority of the disease worldwide. 

Following the adoption of a viral hepatitis resolution<ref>World Hepatitis Day provides an opportunity to focus on specific actions</ref> during the 63rd [[World Health Assembly]] in May 2010, World Hepatitis Day was given global endorsement as the primary focus for national and international awareness-raising efforts and the date was changed to July 28 (in honour of Nobel Laureate Prof. [[Baruch Samuel Blumberg]], discoverer of the hepatitis B virus, who celebrates his birthday on that date).<ref>http://www.worldhepatitisalliance.org/WorldHepatitisDay.aspx</ref> The resolution resolves that:

"1. 28 July shall be designated as World Hepatitis Day in order to provide
an opportunity for education and greater understanding of viral hepatitis as a global public
health problem, and to stimulate the strengthening of preventive and control measures of this 
disease in Member States;"

'''World Hepatitis Day'''

World Hepatitis Day provides an opportunity to focus on specific actions such as:
Strengthening prevention, screening and control of viral hepatitis and its related diseases;
Increasing hepatitis B vaccine coverage and integration into national immunization programmes; and
coordinating a global response to hepatitis to increase access to treatment.

Hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E can cause acute and chronic infection and inflammation of the liver leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
These viruses constitute a major global health risk with an estimated 350 million people being chronically infected with hepatitis B and an estimated 170 million people being chronically infected with hepatitis C.<ref>http://abclive.in/health/who/806-who-world-hepatitis-day-.html</ref>
