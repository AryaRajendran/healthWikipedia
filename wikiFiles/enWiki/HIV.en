A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.<ref name=compendia/>

This is, in turn, surrounded by the [[viral envelope]] that is composed of two layers of fatty molecules called [[phospholipid]]s taken from the membrane of a human cell when a newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. Embedded in the viral envelope are proteins from the host cell and about 70 copies of a complex HIV protein that protrudes through the surface of the virus particle.<ref name=compendia/> This protein, known as Env, consists of a cap made of three molecules called [[gp120|glycoprotein (gp) 120]], and a stem consisting of three [[gp41]] molecules that anchor the structure into the viral envelope.<ref name=Chan>{{cite journal

The RNA genome consists of at least seven structural landmarks ([[Long terminal repeat|LTR]], [[Trans-activation response element (TAR)|TAR]], [[HIV Rev response element|RRE]], PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'', ''tat'', ''rev'', ''nef'', ''vif'', ''vpr'', ''vpu'', and sometimes a tenth ''tev'', which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, ''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'', contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles.<ref name=compendia/> For example, ''env'' codes for a protein called gp160 that is broken down by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, ''tat'', ''rev'', ''nef'', ''vif'', ''vpr'', and ''vpu'' (or ''vpx'' in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.<ref name=compendia/>

The two Tat proteins (p16 and p14) are [[Activator (genetics)|transcriptional transactivators]] for the LTR promoter acting by binding the TAR RNA element. The TAR may also be processed into [[microRNA]]s that regulate the [[apoptosis]] genes [[ERCC1]] and [[IER3]].<ref name="pmid18299284">{{cite journal|author=Ouellet DL, Plante I, Landry P, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of functional microRNAs released through asymmetrical processing of HIV-1 TAR element |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=2353–65 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18299284 |pmc=2367715 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn076 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/7/2353}}</ref><ref name="pmid19220914">{{cite journal |author=Klase Z, Winograd R, Davis J, ''et al.'' |title=HIV-1 TAR miRNA protects against apoptosis by altering cellular gene expression |journal=Retrovirology |volume=6 |issue= 1|page=18 |year=2009 |pmid=19220914 |pmc=2654423 |doi=10.1186/1742-4690-6-18 |url=http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/18 }}</ref>  The [[Rev (HIV)|Rev]] protein (p19) is involved in shuttling RNAs from the nucleus and the cytoplasm by binding to the [[HIV Rev response element|RRE]] RNA element.

Nef also interacts with [[SH3 domain]]s.  The Vpu protein (p16) influences the release of new virus particles from infected cells.<ref name=compendia/> The ends of each strand of HIV RNA contain an RNA sequence called the [[long terminal repeat]] (LTR). Regions in the LTR act as switches to control production of new viruses and can be triggered by proteins from either HIV or the host cell.

The SLIP element (TTTTTT) is involved in the frameshift in the Gag-Pol reading frame required to make functional Pol.<ref name=compendia/>

===Tropism===
{{Main|HIV tropism}}
[[File:HIV Mature and Immature.PNG|thumb|right|Diagram of the immature and mature forms of HIV]]
The term [[viral tropism]] refers to which cell types HIV infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as [[Helper T cell|CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells]], [[macrophage]]s, and [[microglial cell]]s. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with [[chemokine]] coreceptors.<ref name=Chan/>

Macrophage (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1, or non-[[syncitia]]-inducing strains (NSI) use the ''β''-chemokine receptor [[CCR5]] for entry and are, thus, able to replicate in macrophages and CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells.<ref name=Coakley>{{cite journal

Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4<SUP>+</SUP> cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the [[central nervous system]]. In tonsils and [[adenoids]] of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus.

T-tropic isolates, or [[syncitia]]-inducing (SI) strains replicate in primary CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells as well as in macrophages and use the ''α''-chemokine receptor, [[CXCR4]], for entry.<ref name=Coakley /><ref name=Deng>

The ''α''-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed [[HIV tropism|R5]]; those that use only CXCR4 are termed [[HIV tropism|X4]], and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection<ref name=Coakley /> and HIV can also infect a subtype of [[myeloid dendritic cells]],<ref name=Knight>

HIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1 and is restricted in its worldwide distribution. The adoption of "accessory genes" by HIV-2 and its more promiscuous pattern of coreceptor usage (including CD4-independence) may assist the virus in its adaptation to avoid innate restriction factors present in host cells. Adaptation to use normal cellular machinery to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host but ultimately become a [[commensal]] organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants more successful at transmission will be selected.<ref name= CheneyandMcKnight>{{cite book |author= Cheney K, McKnight A |chapter=HIV-2 Tropism and Disease | year=2010 |title=Lentiviruses and Macrophages: Molecular and Cellular Interactions | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn=978-1-904455-60-8 }}</ref>

HIV enters [[macrophage]]s and CD4<SUP>+</SUP> [[T cells]] by the [[adsorption]] of [[glycoprotein]]s on its surface to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the [[viral envelope]] with the cell membrane and the release of the HIV capsid into the cell.<ref name=Chan2>{{cite journal |author=Chan D, Kim P |title=HIV entry and its inhibition |journal=Cell |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=681–4 |year=1998 |pmid=9630213 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81430-0}}</ref><ref name=Wyatt>{{cite journal |author=Wyatt R, Sodroski J |title=The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: fusogens, antigens, and immunogens |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5371 |pages=1884–8 |year=1998 | doi=10.1126/science.280.5371.1884 |pmid=9632381|bibcode = 1998Sci...280.1884W }}</ref>

Entry to the cell begins through interaction of the trimeric envelope complex ([[gp160]] spike) and both [[CD4]] and a chemokine receptor (generally either [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], but others are known to interact) on the cell surface.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/> gp120 binds to [[integrin]] α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> activating [[LFA-1]] the central integrin involved in the establishment of virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1.<ref name=Arthos>{{cite journal |author=Arthos J, Cicala C, Martinelli E, Macleod K, Van Ryk D, Wei D, Xiao Z, Veenstra TD, Conrad TP, Lempicki RA, McLaughlin S, Pascuccio M, Gopaul R, McNally J, Cruz CC, Censoplano N, Chung E, Reitano KN, Kottilil S, Goode DJ, Fauci AS |title=HIV-1 envelope protein binds to and signals through integrin alpha(4)beta(7), the gut mucosal homing receptor for peripheral T cells |journal=Nature Immunol. |volume=In Press |issue= 3|year=2008|pmid=18264102 |doi=10.1038/ni1566 |pages=301–9}}</ref> The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/>

The first step in fusion involves the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of [[gp120]] to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine binding domains of gp120 and allowing them to interact with the target chemokine receptor.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/> This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane.<ref name=Chan2/><ref name=Wyatt/> Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin.

After HIV has bound to the target cell, the HIV [[RNA]] and various [[enzyme]]s, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell.<ref name=Chan2/> During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.

====Replication and transcription====
Shortly after the viral capsid enters the cell, an [[enzyme]] called ''[[reverse transcriptase]]'' liberates the single-stranded (+)[[RNA]] genome from the attached viral proteins and copies it into a [[cDNA|complementary DNA (cDNA)]] molecule.<ref name=Zheng>{{cite journal | author=Zheng YH, Lovsin N, Peterlin BM | title=Newly identified host factors modulate HIV replication | journal=Immunol.

The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]] DNA from the ''antisense'' cDNA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://student.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit3/viruses/hivlc.html |work=Doc Kaiser's Microbiology Home Page |title=IV. VIRUSES > F. ANIMAL VIRUS LIFE CYCLES > 3. The Life Cycle of HIV |publisher=Community College of Baltimore County |date=January 2008 }}</ref> Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the [[cell nucleus]]. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's [[genome]] is carried out by another viral enzyme called ''[[integrase]]''.<ref name=Zheng/>
[[File:Reverse Transcription.png|thumb|left|Reverse transcription of the HIV genome into double strand DNA]]
This integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection.<ref name=Zheng/> To actively produce the virus, certain cellular [[transcription factor]]s need to be present, the most important of which is [[NF-κB|NF-''κ''B]] (NF kappa&nbsp;B), which is upregulated when T-cells become activated.<ref name=Hiscott>{{cite journal | author=Hiscott J, Kwon H, Genin P | title=Hostile takeovers: viral appropriation of the NF-kB pathway | journal=J Clin Invest. | year=2001 | pages=143–151 | volume=107 | issue=2 | pmid=11160127 | doi=10.1172/JCI11918
| pmc=199181 }}</ref> This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection.

During viral replication, the integrated DNA [[provirus]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]], which is then [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]] into smaller pieces. These small pieces are exported from the nucleus into the [[cytoplasm]], where they are [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] into the regulatory proteins [[Tat (HIV)|Tat]] (which encourages new virus production) and [[Rev (HIV)|Rev]]. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to viral mRNAs and allows unspliced RNAs to leave the nucleus, where they are otherwise retained until spliced.<ref name=Pollard>{{cite journal | author=Pollard VW, Malim MH | title=The HIV-1 Rev protein | journal=Annu. Rev. Microbiol. | year=1998 | pages=491–532 | volume=52 | issue= | pmid=9891806 | doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.491 }}</ref> At this stage, the structural proteins Gag and Env are produced from the full-length mRNA. The full-length RNA is actually the virus genome; it binds to the Gag protein and is packaged into new virus particles.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to package their RNA differently; HIV-1 will bind to any appropriate RNA, whereas HIV-2 will preferentially bind to the mRNA that was used to create the Gag protein itself. This may mean that HIV-1 is better able to mutate (HIV-1 infection progresses to AIDS faster than HIV-2 infection and is responsible for the majority of global infections).

====Assembly and release====
[[File:HIV on macrophage.png|thumb|right|HIV assembling on the [[Cell membrane|surface]] of an infected [[macrophage]].]]
The final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and is transported to the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] complex where it is cleaved by [[furin]] resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, [[gp41]] and [[gp120]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hallenberger S, Bosch V, Angliker H, Shaw E, Klenk HD, Garten W |title=Inhibition of furin-mediated cleavage activation of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp160 |journal=Nature|date=26 November 1992 |volume=360|issue=6402 |pages=358–61 |pmid=1360148 }}</ref>  These are transported to the [[plasma membrane]] of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the [[gag]] polyproteins still need to be cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the also packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by [[antiretroviral drug]]s of the [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion.<ref name=Gelderblom>{{cite book | author= Gelderblom HR | year = 1997 | title = HIV sequence compendium | chapter = Fine structure of HIV and SIV |chapterurl=http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/COMPENDIUM/1997/partIII/Gelderblom.pdf  | editor = Los Alamos National Laboratory | edition = | pages = 31–44 | publisher = [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] }}</ref> Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.

===Genetic variability===
{{Further|Subtypes of HIV}}
[[File:HIV-SIV-phylogenetic-tree.svg|thumb|left|The [[phylogenetic tree]] of the SIV and HIV]]
HIV differs from many viruses in that it has very high [[genetic variability]]. This diversity is a result of its fast [[HIV#Replication cycle|replication cycle]], with the generation of about 10<sup>10</sup> virions every day, coupled with a high [[mutation rate]] of approximately 3 x 10<sup>−5</sup> per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and [[Genetic recombination|recombinogenic]] properties of reverse transcriptase.<ref name=RobertsonDL>{{cite journal | author=Robertson DL, Hahn BH, Sharp PM. | title=Recombination in AIDS viruses | journal=J Mol Evol. | year=1995 | pages=249–59 | volume=40 | issue=3 | pmid=7723052 | doi=10.1007/BF00163230}}</ref><ref name="Rambaut_2004">{{cite journal | title=The causes and consequences of HIV evolution | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=5 | year=2004 | month=January | doi=10.1038/nrg1246 | pmid=14708016 | url=http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/downloadPaper.php?id=242 | issue=52–61 | last1=Rambaut |first1=A | last2=Posada | first2=D | last3=Crandall | first3=KA | last4=Holmes | first4=EC | pages=52–61}}</ref><ref name="pmid17960579">{{cite journal |author=Perelson AS, Ribeiro RM |title=Estimating drug efficacy and viral dynamic parameters: HIV and HCV |journal=Stat Med |volume=27 |issue=23 |pages=4647–57 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=17960579 |doi=10.1002/sim.3116 |url=}}</ref>

This complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day.<ref name=RobertsonDL/> This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral [[DNA sequence]] that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes.<ref name=RobertsonDL/> This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.<ref name=RobertsonDL/>

The closely related [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) has evolved into many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the [[African green monkey]] (SIVagm) and [[sooty mangabey]] (SIVsmm) are thought to have a long evolutionary history with their hosts.

In contrast, when these strains infect species that have not adapted to SIV ("heterologous" hosts such as rhesus or cynomologus macaques), the animals develop AIDS and the virus generates [[genetic diversity]] similar to what is seen in human HIV infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Daniel MD, King NW, Letvin NL, Hunt RD, Sehgal PK, Desrosiers RC |title=A new type D retrovirus isolated from macaques with an immunodeficiency syndrome |journal=Science |volume=223 |issue=4636 |pages=602–5 |year=1984 |pmid=6695172 |doi=10.1126/science.6695172|bibcode = 1984Sci...223..602D }}</ref> Chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz), the closest genetic relative of HIV-1, is associated with increased mortality and AIDS-like symptoms in its natural host.<ref name=pmid19626114>{{Cite pmid|19626114}}</ref> SIVcpz appears to have been transmitted relatively recently to chimpanzee and human populations, so their hosts have not yet adapted to the virus.<ref name=pmid19661993/> This virus has also lost a function of the [[Nef (protein)|Nef]] gene that is present in most SIVs; without this function, T cell depletion is more likely, leading to immunodeficiency.<ref name=pmid19626114/>

HIV-1 testing is initially by an [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate.<ref name=CDC2001>{{cite journal | author=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | title=Revised guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral | journal=MMWR Recomm Rep | year=2001 | pages=1–57 | volume=50 | issue=RR–19 | pmid=11718472 }}</ref> If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., [[Western blot]] or, less commonly, an [[immunofluorescence assay]] (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by Western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection.

Although IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used.

{{Main|HIV/AIDS research}}
HIV/AIDS research includes all [[medical research]] which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure [[HIV/AIDS]] as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.

Currently, no cure for HIV/AIDS exists. The most universally recommended method for the [[prevention of HIV/AIDS]] is to avoid blood-to-blood contact between people and to otherwise practice [[safe sex]]. The most recommended method for treating HIV is to receive attention from a doctor who would coordinate the patient's [[management of HIV/AIDS]].

Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral [[health interventions]], such as research into [[sex education]], and [[drug development]], such as research into [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]], [[HIV vaccines]], and [[antiretroviral drugs]]. Other medical research areas include the topics of [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], [[post-exposure prophylaxis]], and [[Circumcision and HIV]].

A hybrid virus, simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), combining parts between HIV and SIV, was created in order to further study different aspects of HIV.<ref>{{cite doi|10.5772/53556|noedit}}</ref>

Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III.  At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a patient presenting with swelling of the [[lymph node]]s of the neck and [[asthenia|physical weakness]], two classic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I.  Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).<ref name="Basavapathruni_2007"/> As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aldrich|first=ed. by Robert|title=Who's who in gay and lesbian history.|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415229746|pages=154|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=9KA7_1s6w-QC&pg=PA154|coauthors=Wotherspoon, Garry}}</ref>

===Origins===
Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human [[primate]]s in West-central Africa and to have transferred to humans (a process known as [[zoonosis]]) in the early 20th century.<ref name=Orgin2011>{{cite journal|last=Sharp|first=PM|coauthors=Hahn, BH|title=Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic|journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine|date=2011 Sep|volume=1|issue=1|pages=a006841|pmid=22229120|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a006841|pmc=3234451}}</ref> HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern [[Cameroon]] through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) that infects wild [[chimpanzee]]s (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'').<ref name="pmid9989410">{{cite journal |author=Gao F, Bailes E, Robertson DL, ''et al.'' |title=Origin of HIV-1 in the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes |journal=Nature |volume=397 |issue=6718|pages=436–41|year=1999 |month=February |pmid=9989410 |doi=10.1038/17130 |url=|bibcode = 1999Natur.397..436G}}</ref><ref name=Keele>{{cite journal | author=Keele BF, van Heuverswyn F, Li YY, Bailes E, Takehisa J, Santiago ML, Bibollet-Ruche F, Chen Y, Wain LV, Liegois F, Loul S, Mpoudi Ngole E, Bienvenue Y, Delaporte E, Brookfield JFY, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Peeters M, Hahn BH | title=Chimpanzee reservoirs of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 | journal=Science |date=28 July 2006| volume=313 | issue=5786 | pages=523–6 | doi = 10.1126/science.1126531 | pmc=2442710 |pmid=16728595 |bibcode = 2006Sci...313..523K }}</ref> The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the [[sooty mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys atys''), an old world monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern [[Senegal]] to western [[Côte d'Ivoire]]).<ref name=Reeves>{{cite journal | author=Reeves JD, Doms RW | title=Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 | journal=J.

Specific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing.
