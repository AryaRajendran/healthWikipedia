==Indications==
Falloposcopy has been primarily used in diagnosis and management of tubal infertility, however, it is  generally not considered part of the routine work-up for infertility.<ref name=rimbach/> Most tubal problems in women with [[infertility]] are treated by IVF. There is no established role for falloposcopy for evaluation of other tubal pathology.

==Instrumentation==
The first modern falloposcope that was described was the coaxial system by Kerin in 1970.<ref name=rimbach/> Later the linerar-everting catheter (LEC) system was introduced.<ref name=wong/> A coaxial falloposcope is an microendoscope of 0.5&nbsp;mm diameter that is flexible and contains optical and illuminating fibers; it has a magnifying capacity. The coaxial system needs a [[hysteroscope]] for its uterine passage. In contrast, the LEC system consists of a external unfurling ballon catheter with an internal endoscope that is used transcervically without the need for a hysteroscope.<ref name=wong/>

==Procedure==
The patient needs [[general anesthesia]] or [[conscious sedation]] for the duration of the procedure and is in a [[lithotomy position]]. For the coaxial system initially a [[hysteroscope]] is introduced into the uterus to identify the proximal tubal ostium.<ref name=kerin>{{cite journal | author=Kerin JF, Williams DB, San Roman GA, Pearlstone AC, Grundfest WS, Surrey ES  |title=Falloposcopic classification and treatment of fallopian tube lumen disease | journal=Fertility and Sterility | pmid=1555683 | year=1992 | volume=57 | issue=4 | pages=731–41}}</ref> Once the ostium is identified the falloposcope can be inserted through the operative channel of the hysteroscope and advanced. With the LEC system the balloon catheter is advanced into the uterine horn, and then, under endoscopic visison the endoscope is advanced into the tube as the balloon catheter unfurls. Findings can be projected on a videosystem.

==Findings and interventions==
The typical method of tubal evaluation, [[hysterosalpingography]], has shortcomings in terms of false negative and false positive results.<ref name=wong/> It has been argued that falloposcopy allows for a more accurate evaluation of the tubal canal.<ref name=wong/> Obstructions, adhesions within the tubal canal, and debris can be identified. The procedure allows removal of debris or filmy adhesions from within the fallopian tube, further in selected cases proximal tubal obstruction can be overcome and the tube can be recanalized allowing for pregnancy.<ref name=schill/> Proximal tubal occlusion has also been overcome by using hysteroscopy with tubal canalization using a catheter, not a falloposcope.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sulak PJ, Letterie GS, Hayslip CC, Coddington CC, Klein TA.|title=Hysteroscopic cannulation and lavage in the treatment of proximal tubal occlusion |journal=Steril Fertil |pmid=2957240 |year=1987 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=493–4}}</ref> Extensive [[tubal obstruction]], however, cannot be overcome by falloposcopy and would require [[tuboplasty|tubal surgery]] or [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to be overcome to achieve a pregnancy.<ref name=kerin/>

==Complications==
Perforation of a fallopian tube appears the only reported complication and is encountered in about 4-5% of inspected tubes.<ref name=wong/><ref name=rimbach/>

==Limitations==
In 2001, Rimbach et al. reported in a large multicenter study involving 367 patients on the limitations of the procedure.<ref name=rimbach>{{cite journal| author=Rimbach S, Bastert G, Wallwiener D. |title=Technical results of falloposcopy for infertility diagnosis in a large multicentre study |journal=Hum Reprod. |month=May |pmid=11331639| year=2001| volume=16| issue=5| pages=925–30}}</ref> Problems were encountered in the ability to enter the tubes, and, even when tubes were cannulated, light reflexions or "white out" from healthy tissue as well as adhesions turned out to be a major problem.<ref name=rimbach/> Thus, the investigators were able to fully examine tubes in only 2 out of 3 cases; perforations occurred in about 4% of cases. Since then, interest in falloposcopy has declined and few studies have been published.
