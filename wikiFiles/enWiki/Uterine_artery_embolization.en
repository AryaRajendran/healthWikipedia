'''Uterine artery [[embolization]]''' (UAE)  is a procedure where an [[interventional radiologist]] uses a [[catheter]] to deliver small particles that block the [[blood]] supply to the uterine body. If the procedure is done for the treatment of uterine [[fibroids]] it is also called '''uterine fibroid embolization''' (UFE).

==Procedure and indications==
Under [[local anesthesia]], an interventional radiologist introduces a catheter into the [[femoral artery]] at the groin and uses radiographic guidance to advance the catheter into the [[uterine artery]]. Microparticles (spheres or beads) are then released, which will block blood flow through the vessel. Even if both uterine arteries are occluded, abdundant [[collateral circulation]] prevents the uterus from necrosing. The procedure is not a surgical intervention, and allows the uterus to be kept in place.

UAE is frequently used to relieve symptoms caused by [[uterine fibroids]]. It has satisfaction rates similar to [[hysterectomy]] and much shorter recovery times. It does affect fertility in some cases and other interventions may provide better results when fertility should be preserved.<ref name=Gupta_2012/>

UAE can also be used to control heavy uterine bleeding for reasons other than fibroids, such as postpartum [[obstetrical hemorrhage]].<ref>[http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/93/4/591 Management of severe postpartum haemorrhage by uterine artery embolization]</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The rate of serious adverse effects is comparable to that of myomectomy or hysterectomy. The advantage of substantially faster recovery time is offset by a higher rate of minor complications.<ref name=Gupta_2012>{{cite pmid|22592701}}</ref>

Adverse effects that have been reported include death from embolism, or septicemia (the presence of pus-forming or other pathogenic organisms, or their toxins, in the blood or tissues) resulting in multiple organ failure.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb11119.x |author=Vashisht A, Studd JW, Carey AH |title=Fibroid Embolisation: A Technique Not Without Significant Complications |journal=British Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=107 |issue=9 |pages=1166–1170 |year=2000}}</ref> Infection from tissue death of fibroids, leading to endometritis (infection of the uterus) resulting in lengthy hospitalization for administration of intravenous antibiotics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Block S, de Bries C, Prinssen HM |title=Fatal Sepss after Uterine Artery Embolization with Microspheres |journal=Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=779–783 |year=2003 |pmid=12817046}}</ref> Misembolization from microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles flowing or drifting into organs or tissues where they were not intended to be, causing damage to other organs or other parts of the body.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000141567.25541.26 |author=Dietz DM, Stahfeld KR, Bansal SK |title=Buttock Necrosis After Uterine Artery Embolization |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=104 |issue=Supplement |pages=1159–1161 |year=2004}}</ref> Ovarian damage resulting from embolic material migrating to the ovaries.
