The '''rhombencephalon''' (or '''hindbrain''') is a [[Morphogenesis|developmental]] categorization of portions of the [[central nervous system]] in [[vertebrates]]. It includes the [[Medulla_oblongata|medulla]], [[pons]], and [[cerebellum]].
[[File:Rhombencephalon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rhombencephalon]]
The rhombencephalon can be subdivided in a variable number of transversal swellings called [[rhombomere]]s. In the human embryo eight rhombomeres can be distinguished, from caudal to rostral: Rh8-Rh1. Rostrally, the [[List of anatomical isthmi|isthmus]] demarcates the boundary with the midbrain or mesencephalon. 

A rare disease of the rhombencephalon, "rhombencephalosynapsis," is characterized by a missing [[vermis]] resulting in a fused cerebellum. Patients generally present with cerebellar [[ataxia]]. 

The caudal rhombencephalon has been generally considered as the initiation site for neural tube closure.<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/f3fc056wde57c1yc/ SpringerLink - Journal Article<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Myelencephalon==
Rhombomeres Rh8-Rh4 form the [[myelencephalon]].

The myelencephalon forms the [[medulla oblongata]] in the adult brain; it contains:
* a portion of the [[fourth ventricle]], 
* the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX), 
* [[vagus nerve]] (CN X), 
* [[accessory nerve]] (CN XI), 
* [[hypoglossal nerve]] (CN XII), 
* and a portion of the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] (CN VIII).

==Metencephalon==
Rhombomeres Rh3-Rh1 form the [[metencephalon]].

The metencephalon is composed of the [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]]; it contains:
* a portion of the fourth ventricle, 
* the [[trigeminal nerve]] (CN V), 
* [[abducens nerve]] (CN VI), 
* [[facial nerve]] (CN VII), 
* and a portion of the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] (CN VIII).

==Evolution==

The hindbrain is homologous to a part of the [[arthropod]] brain known as the sub-oesophageal ganglion, in terms of the genes that it expresses and its position in between the brain and the nerve cord.<ref name=Ghysen>{{Cite journal|author=Ghysen A |title=The origin and evolution of the nervous system |journal=Int.
