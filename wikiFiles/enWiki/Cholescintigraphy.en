A '''cholescintigraphy''' scan,  also known as: Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid '''HIDA''', Paraisopropyl Iminodiacetic Acid '''PIPIDA''', or Diisopropyl Iminodiacetic Acid '''DISIDA''' scan is a nuclear imaging procedure to evaluate the health and function of the [[gallbladder]]. A radioactive tracer, usually a {{chem|link=technetium-99m|99|Tc}}-[[iminodiacetic acid]] [[Chelation|chelate complex]], is injected through any accessible vein, then allowed to circulate to the [[liver]], where it is excreted into the [[biliary system]] and stored by the gallbladder and [[biliary system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hida-scan/AN00424 |title=HIDA scan (cholescintigraphy): Why is it performed? |accessdate=2007-12-11 |last=Michael |first=Picco, M.D. |publisher=Mayo Clinic }}</ref>

In the absence of disease, the gallbladder is visualized within 1 hour of the injection of the radioactive tracer. If the gallbladder is not visualized within 4 hours after the injection, this indicates either [[cholecystitis]] or [[cystic duct]] obstruction.  This investigation is usually conducted after an ultrasound examination of the abdominal right upper quadrant for pain.  If the non-invasive ultrasound examination fails to demonstrate gall stones (or other obstruction to the gall bladder or biliary tree) in an attempt to establish a cause of right upper quadrant pain, this cholescintigraphy scan can be performed as a more sensitive and specific test.  Cholescintigraphy scans are not generally done first line due to their increased cost and invasiveness.

Cholescintigraphy for acute cholecystitis has sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 94%.<ref name="pmid7979854">{{cite journal| author=Shea JA, Berlin JA, Escarce JJ, Clarke JR, Kinosian BP, Cabana MD et al.| title=Revised estimates of diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity in suspected biliary tract disease. | journal=Arch Intern Med | year= 1994 | volume= 154 | issue= 22 | pages= 2573â€“81 | pmid=7979854 | doi= 10.1001/archinte.154.22.2573| pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=7979854  }}</ref> Several investigators have found the senstivity being consistently higher than 90% though specificity has varied from 73%- 99%, yet compared to [[ultrasonography]], cholescintigraphy has proven to be superior.<ref name="MedinaBlackmore2011">{{cite book|author1=L.
