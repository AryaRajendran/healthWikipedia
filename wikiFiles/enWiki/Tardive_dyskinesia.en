'''Tardive dyskinesia''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɑr|d|ɨ|v|_|ˌ|d|ɪ|s|k|ɨ|ˈ|n|iː|ʒ|ə}} is a difficult-to-treat form of [[dyskinesia]], a disorder resulting in involuntary, repetitive body movements.  In this form of dyskinesia, the involuntary movements are ''tardive,'' meaning they have a slow or belated onset.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000033097|tardive dyskinesia}}</ref> This neurological disorder frequently appears after long-term or high-dose use of [[antipsychotic]] drugs,<ref group="N">[[prochlorperazine]], [[risperidone]]</ref> or in children and infants as a side effect from usage of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders.<ref group="N">[[cisapride]], [[metoclopramide]]</ref><ref name="breggin_2001">{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Breggin |title=Tardive Dyskinesia Legal Settlement |url=http://breggin.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=132}}{{MEDRS|date=June 2012}}</ref>

==Features==
Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements.  Some examples of these types of involuntary movements include grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering and pursing of the lips, and rapid eye blinking. Rapid, involuntary movements of the limbs, torso, and fingers may also occur.<ref name="ninds.nih.gov">National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. (2011).

Respiratory irregularity, such as grunting and difficulty breathing, is another symptom associated with tardive dyskinesia, although studies have shown that the prevalence rate is relatively low.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb02717.x |title=Respiratory irregularity and tardive dyskinesia a prevalence study |year=1986 |last1=Yassa |first1=R. |last2=Lal |first2=S. |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=506–10 |pmid=2875609}}</ref>

Tardive dyskinesia is often misdiagnosed as a [[mental illness]] rather than a [[neurological disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(85)72863-0 |title=Complications of tardive dyskinesia: A review |year=1985 |last1=Yassa |first1=Ramzy |last2=Jones |first2=Barry D. |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=305–7, 310, 312–3 |pmid=2859630}}</ref> and as a result patients are prescribed neuroleptic drugs, which enhance the probability that the patient will develop a severe and disabling case, and may even experience a shorter survival period.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.049395 |title=Mortality and tardive dyskinesia: Long-term study using the US National Death Index |year=2009 |last1=Dean |first1=C. E. |last2=Thuras |first2=P. D. |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=194 |issue=4 |pages=360–4 |pmid=19336789}}</ref>

Other closely related neurological disorders have been recognized as variants of tardive dyskinesia. Tardive [[dystonia]] is similar to standard [[dystonia]] but permanent. Tardive [[akathisia]] involves painful feelings of inner tension and anxiety and a compulsive drive to move the body.  In some extreme cases, afflicted individuals experience so much internal torture that they lose their ability to sit still. Tardive [[tourettism]] is a [[tic]] disorder featuring the same symptoms as [[Tourette syndrome]].  The two disorders are extremely close in nature and oftentimes can only be differentiated by the details of their respective onsets.  Tardive [[myoclonus]], a rare disorder, presents as brief jerks of muscles in the face, neck, trunk, and extremities.<ref name="dukehealth.org"/>

==Cause==
Tardive dyskinesia was first described in the 1950s shortly after the introduction of [[chlorpromazine]] and other [[antipsychotic drugs]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2905654 |year=1988 |last1=Baldessarini |first1=Ross J. |title=A summary of current knowledge of tardive dyskinesia |volume=14 |issue=Spec Issue |pages=263–8 |journal=L'Encéphale}}</ref>  However, the exact mechanism of the disorder remains largely uncertain. The most compelling line of evidence suggests that tardive dyskinesia may result primarily from neuroleptic-induced [[dopamine]] supersensitivity in the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], with the D2 dopamine receptor being most affected.  Neuroleptics act primarily on this dopamine system, and older neuroleptics, which have greater affinity for the D2 binding site, are associated with high risk for tardive dyskinesia.<ref name="hoerger_2007">{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Hoerger |title=The primacy of neuroleptic-Induced D2 receptor hypersensitivity in tardive dyskinesia |url=http://www.priory.com/tardive-dyskinesia.htm}}{{MEDRS|date=June 2012}}</ref> The D2 hypersensitivity hypothesis is also supported by evidence of a dose-response relationship, withdrawal effects, studies on D2 agonists and antagonists, animal studies, and genetic polymorphism research.<ref name="hoerger_2007"/>

Given similar doses of the same neuroleptic, differences among individuals still exist in the likelihood of developing tardive dyskinesia.  Such individual differences may be due to genetic polymorphisms, which code for D2 receptor binding site affinity, or prior exposure to environmental toxins. Decreased functional reserve or cognitive dysfunction, associated with aging, mental retardation, alcohol and drug abuse, or traumatic head injuries, has also been shown to increase risk of developing the disorder among those treated with neuroleptics.<ref name="hoerger_2007"/> Antipsychotic drugs can sometimes camouflage the signs of tardive dyskinesia from occurring in the early stages; this can happen from the individual having an increased dose of an antipsychotic drug.  Oftentimes the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia are not apparent until the individual comes off of the antipsychotic drugs; however, when tardive dyskinesia worsens, the signs become visible.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Colin A |last1=Ross |first2=John |last2=Read |year=2004 |chapter=Antipsychotic medication: myths and facts |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=SomdZ-8jnVgC&pg=PA101 |pages=101–14 |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Read |editor2-first=Loren R. |editor2-last=Mosher |editor3-first=Richard P. |editor3-last=Bentall |title=Models of Madness: Psychological, Social and Biological Approaches to Schizophrenia |publisher=Brunner-Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-58391-906-4}}</ref>

Other dopamine antagonists and [[antiemetics]] can cause tardive dyskinesia, such as [[metoclopramide]] and [[promethazine]], used to treat [[gastrointestinal]] disorders. While newer [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[olanzapine]] and [[risperidone]] appear to have fewer dystonic effects, only [[clozapine]] has been shown to have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia than older antipsychotics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Craig |last2=Stitzel |title=Modern Pharmacology |edition=6th |page=401}}</ref> There has been a reported case of the anti-psychotic medication [[aripiprazole]], a partial agonist at D2 receptors, leading to tardive dyskinesia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0269881108089591 |title=A case of aripiprazole and tardive dyskinesia |year=2008 |last1=Abbasian |first1=C |last2=Power |first2=P |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=214–5 |pmid=18515468}}</ref>

The available research seems to suggest that the concurrent prophylactic use of a neuroleptic and an antiparkinsonian drug is useless to avoid early [[extrapyramidal system|extrapyramidal]] side-effects and may render the patient more sensitive to tardive dyskinesia. Since 1973 the use of these drugs has been found to be associated with the development of tardive dyskinesia.<ref name="crane_1973A">{{cite journal |pmid=4727768 |year=1973 |last1=Crane |first1=GE |title=Is tardive dyskinesia a drug effect? |volume=130 |issue=9 |pages=1043–4 |journal=The American journal of psychiatry}}</ref><ref name="crane_1973B">{{cite journal |pmid=4728916 |year=1973 |last1=Crane |first1=GE |title=Rapid reversal of tardive dyskinesia |volume=130 |issue=10 |pages=1159 |journal=The American journal of psychiatry}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Primary prevention]] of tardive dyskinesia is achieved by using the lowest effective dose of a [[neuroleptic]] for the shortest time.  However, with diseases of chronic psychosis such as schizophrenia, this strategy must be balanced with the fact that increased dosages of neuroleptics are more beneficial in preventing recurrence of psychosis. If tardive dyskinesia is diagnosed, the causative drug should be discontinued. Tardive dyskinesia may persist after withdrawal of the drug for months, years or even permanently.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18070868 |year=2007 |last1=Rauchverger |first1=B |last2=Isakov |first2=V |last3=Jabarin |first3=M |title=Olanzapine-induced tardive dystonia successfully treated by tetrabenazine |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=484–5 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.19.4.484-a |journal=The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.nrl.0000038585.58012.97 |title=Classification and Treatment of Tardive Syndromes |year=2003 |last1=Fernandez |first1=Hubert H. |last2=Friedman |first2=Joseph H. |journal=The Neurologist |volume=9 |pages=16–27 |pmid=12801428 |issue=1}}</ref>  Some studies suggest that physicians should consider using [[atypical antipsychotics]] as a substitute to [[typical antipsychotics]] for patients requiring medication.

Currently, the only approved drug for treating tardive dyskinesia and other movement disorders is [[tetrabenazine]], which is a dopamine depleting drug.<ref name="ninds.nih.gov"/>  Ondansetron ([[Zofran]]) has shown some benefit in experimental studies on tardive dyskinesia and a variety of anti-Parkinsonian medications are used such as [[Aricept]], [[Baclofen]], [[Requip]] and [[Mirapex]]. [[Clonidine]] is used for dystonic spasms and can be of help. [[Botox]] injections are used for minor focal dystonia, but not in more advanced tardive dyskinesia.<ref>{{cite web |first1=James Robert |last1=Brasic |editor1-first=Selim R |editor1-last=Benbadis |date=February 9, 2012 |title=Tardive Dyskinesia |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1151826-overview |work=[[eMedicine]]}}</ref> A review paper found [[benzodiazepine]]s<ref group="N">[[benzodiazepine]] drugs e.g. [[lorazepam]], [[diazepam]], or [[clonazepam]]</ref> to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000205.pub2 |title=Benzodiazepines for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2006 |last1=Bhoopathi |first1=Paranthaman Sethupathi |last2=Soares-Weiser |first2=Karla |editor1-last=Bhoopathi |editor1-first=Paranthaman Sethupathi |pmid=16855954 |issue=3 |pages=CD000205}}</ref> However, like most [[anticonvulsants]], benzodiazepines may cause tremors as well as [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] upon rapid discontinuation.{{fact|date=June 2012}}

In males, the [[branched-chain amino acid]] formula Tarvil, containing the amino acids [[valine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[leucine]] in a 3:3:4 ratio was reported as beneficial for motor symptoms in a small, non-blinded study.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.6.1117 |title=Efficacy of the Branched-Chain Amino Acids in the Treatment of Tardive Dyskinesia in Men |year=2003 |last1=Richardson |first1=Mary Ann |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=6 |pages=1117–24 |pmid=12777270 |last2=Bevans |first2=Margaret L. |last3=Read |first3=Laura L. |last4=Chao |first4=Helen M. |last5=Clelland |first5=James D. |last6=Suckow |first6=Raymond F. |last7=Maher |first7=Timothy J. |last8=Citrome |first8=Leslie}}</ref>

In 1981, Charles Tkacz, M.D, and David R. Hawkins, M.D published the paper A Preventive Measure 
for Tardive Dyskinesia in the Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry/Medicine, detailing the clinical use of the [[vitamins]] Ascorbic Acid, either Niacinamide (Formula 1) / Niacin (Formula 2), Pyridoxine HC1, and d-AlphaTocopheryl Acetate in the prevention of Tardive Dyskenesia<ref name="ORTHOMOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY, VOLUME 10, NUMBER 2, 1981, Pp. 119-123">{{cite journal |chapter=A Preventive Measure  for Tardive Dyskinesia |url=http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1981/pdf/1981-v10n02-p119.pdf |year=1981 |last1=Tkacz |first1=Charles |last2=Hawkins |first2=David R. |journal=Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry}}</ref>

Recent studies have tested the use of [[melatonin]], high dosage [[vitamins]], and different [[antioxidants]] in concurrence with antipsychotic drugs (often used to treat [[schizophrenia]]) as a way of preventing and treating tardive dyskinesia.  Although further research is needed, studies reported a much lower percentage of individuals developing tardive dyskinesia than the current prevalence rate for those taking antipsychotic drugs.<ref name="Lerner, V. 2011 pp. 109-134">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-0834-1_6 |chapter=Antioxidants as a Treatment and Prevention of Tardive Dyskinesia |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=SJLrIa7yFBgC&pg=PA109 |title=Handbook of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders, Volume III |year=2011 |last1=Lerner |first1=Vladimir |isbn=978-94-007-0833-4 |pages=109–34}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Tardive dyskinesia most commonly occurs in patients with psychiatric conditions who are treated with [[antipsychotic]] medications for many years.  The average prevalence rate has been estimated to be around 30% for individuals taking antipsychotic medication, such as that used to treat schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(02)00647-8 |title=Tardive dyskinesias and antipsychotics: A review |year=2002 |last1=Llorca |first1=Pierre-Michel |last2=Chereau |first2=Isabelle |last3=Bayle |first3=Frank-Jean |last4=Lancon |first4=Christophe |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=129–38 |pmid=12052573}}</ref>  A study being conducted at the Yale University School of Medicine has estimated that "32% of patients develop persistent tics after 5 years on major tranquilizers, 57% by 15 years, and 68% by 25 years."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Glenmullen |first1=Joseph |year=2001 |title=Prozac Backlash: Overcoming the Dangers of Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and Other Antidepressants With Safe, Effective Alternatives |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-0062-2 |page=38}}{{MEDRS|date=June 2012}} ::referring to {{cite journal |pmid=8098030 |year=1993 |last1=Glazer |first1=William M. |last2=Morgenstern |first2=Hal |last3=Doucette |first3=John T. |title=Predicting the long-term risk of tardive dyskinesia in outpatients maintained on neuroleptic medications |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=133–9 |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry}}</ref>  More drastic data was found during a longitudinal study conducted on individuals 45 years of age and older who were taking antipsychotic drugs.  According to this research study, 26% of patients developed tardive dyskinesia after just one year on the medication.  Another 60% of this at-risk group developed the disorder after 3 years, and 23% developed ''severe'' cases of tardive dyskinesia within 3 years.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950210050010 |title=Risk of Tardive Dyskinesia in Older Patients: A Prospective Longitudinal Study of 266 Outpatients |year=1995 |last1=Jeste |first1=Dilip V. |last2=Caligiuri |first2=Michael P. |last3=Paulsen |first3=Jane S. |last4=Heaton |first4=Robert K. |last5=Lacro |first5=Jonathan P. |last6=Harris |first6=M.

Elderly patients are more prone to develop tardive dyskinesia, and elderly women are more at-risk than elderly men.  The risk is much lower for younger men and women, and also more equal across the sexes.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14613418 |year=2002 |last1=Marshall |first1=DL |last2=Hazlet |first2=TK |last3=Gardner |first3=JS |last4=Blough |first4=DK |title=Neuroleptic drug exposure and incidence of tardive dyskinesia: A records-based case-control study |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=259–65 |journal=Journal of managed care pharmacy}}</ref>  Patients who have undergone electro-convulsive therapy or have a history of diabetes or alcohol abuse also have a higher risk of developing tardive dyskinesia.<ref name=pmid16001096/>

Several studies have recently been conducted comparing the prevalence rate of tardive dyskinesia with second generation, or more modern, antipsychotic drugs to that of first generation drugs.  Some of these studies claim that the newer, second generation antipsychotic drugs have a reduced potential for causing tardive dyskinesia.<ref name="Lerner, V. 2011 pp. 109-134"/>  Conversely, other studies dispute these claims and report that the prevalence rate has not significantly decreased with the use of more expensive antipsychotic medication.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52014-2.00043-4 |chapter=Epidemiology of tardive dyskinesia before and during the era of modern antipsychotic drugs |series=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders |title=Handbook of Clinical Neurology |year=2011 |last1=Tarsy |first1=Daniel |last2=Lungu |first2=Codrin |last3=Baldessarini |first3=Ross J. |isbn=978-0-444-52014-2 |volume=100 |pages=601–16 |pmid=21496610 |editor1-first=P. J. |editor1-last=Vinken |editor2-first=G. W. |editor2-last=Bruyn}}</ref>

A physician can evaluate and diagnose a patient with tardive dyskinesia by conducting a systematic examination.  The physician should ask the patient to relax, and look for symptoms like facial grimacing, eye or lip movements, tics, respiratory irregularities, and tongue movements.  In some cases, patients experience nutritional problems, so a physician can also look for a gain or loss in weight.<ref name=pmid16001096/>

Tardive dyskinesia can be socially disabling, perhaps in addition to the underlying psychiatric disorder, and may cause inflicted patients to isolate themselves.  Stressful events can also trigger the onset of dyskinetic movements, whereas relaxation and sedation reduce the severity of symptoms in patients.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Dilip V. |last1=Jeste |first2=Michael P. |last2=Caligiuri |title=Tardive Dyskinesia |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |pmid=8100643 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8100643 |doi=10.1093/schbul/19.2.303 |year=1993 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=303–15}}</ref>
