'''Urocanic aciduria''', also called '''urocanate hydratase deficiency''' or '''urocanase deficiency''',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Imaeda M, Wada Y |title=Urocanic aciduria (urocanase deficiency) |journal=Ryoikibetsu Shokogun Shirizu. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=150–151 |year=1998 |pmid=9590012 }}</ref> is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[metabolic disorder]] caused by a deficiency of the [[enzyme]] [[urocanase]]. It is a secondary disorder of [[histidine]] metabolism.<ref name=uaommbid>''Disorders of histidine metabolism.''<br>http://www.ommbid.com/OMMBID/the_online_metabolic_and_molecular_bases_of_inherited_disease/b/abstract/part8/ch80</ref>  

==Pathophysiology==

The [[amino acid]] histidine, when catalyzed by the enzyme [[histidase]], forms [[urocanic acid]]. Disruptions in this pathway, caused by a deficiency of histidase, is the underlying cause of [[histidinemia]]. This results in reduced levels of skin and [[blood test|serum]] urocanic acid, the primary indicator of insufficient histidase activity.

In urocanic aciduria, increased urocanic acid in the [[urine]] indicates a deficiency of the enzyme urocanase. This enzyme breaks down urocanic acid, forming [[formininoglutamic acid]], and also forms [[imidazolonepropionic acid]] from trans-urocanic acid. 

With normal to only slightly elevated levels of histidine present in the liver during urocanic aciduria, the only true metabolic indicator of the disorder can be found in the urine.<ref name=uaommbid/>  

==Symptoms==

Urocanic aciduria is thought to be relatively benign.<ref name=uaommbid/> Although aggressive behavior and [[mental retardation]] have been reported with the disorder,<ref name=uald>{{cite journal |author=Kalafatic Z, Lipovac K, Jezerinac Z, Juretic D, Dumic M, Zurga M, Res L |title=A liver urocanase deficiency |journal=Metabolism |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1013–1019 |year=1980 |pmid=6107814 |doi=10.1016/0026-0495(80)90209-7 }}</ref> no definitive neurometabolic connection has yet been established.<ref name=uaommbid/>

==Genetics==

[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Urocanic aciduria has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Urocanic aciduria has an autosomal [[recessive]] inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene - one copy inherited from each parent - are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.
