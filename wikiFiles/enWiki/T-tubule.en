A '''T-tubule''' (or '''transverse tubule''') is a deep [[invagination]] of the [[sarcolemma]], which is the [[plasma membrane]],  only found in [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[cardiac muscle]] cells.  These invaginations allow [[depolarization]] of the membrane to quickly penetrate to the interior of the cell.

==Structure==
Each [[muscle fibre]] is surrounded by a [[sarcolemma]] (the muscle fiber's [[plasma membrane]]). Transverse tubules are invaginations of the [[sarcolemma]]. Though the invaginations are normally perpendicular to the length of the fiber, many T-tubules can lie axial to the long-axis of the fiber, both wrapping around and running alongside [[myofilament |myofilament bundles]]. The size and arrangement of T-tubules vary depending on muscle type and species. T-tubules are thought to be rich in a number of proteins, including a large number of [[DHP receptor|L-type calcium channels]]. 

In skeletal muscle cells, T-tubules are typically located at the junction overlap between the A and I bands of the [[sarcomere]], and together with a ''pair'' of [[terminal cisternae]] (bulbous enlarged areas of the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]) it forms an arrangement called a [[triad (anatomy)|triad]].

In cardiac muscle, the T-tubule membrane is normally opposed to a ''single'' terminal cisterna, which may wrap around the T-tubule. This occurs at the [[Sarcomere#Bands|Z line]] and is called a [[diad]]. 

It is physiologically important for excitation-contraction coupling (see section below) that the T-tubules are positioned close to the [[terminal cisternae]] of the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] as the [[triad (anatomy)|triad]] or [[diad]] arrangement allows physical and functional contact by voltage dependent [[DHP receptor|L-type calcium channels]]. So, an [[action potential]] along the sarcolemma causes calcium channels to open in the [[terminal cisternae]]/[[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which enables calcium to move from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into cytoplasm and the intracellular calcium concentration to increase.

==Excitation-contraction coupling==

''See [[Excitation-contraction coupling]]''

T-tubules are the major sites for the coupling of excitation and [[muscle contraction|contraction]], which is the process whereby the spreading depolarization is converted into force production by muscle fibers. The L-type calcium channels in T-tubules activate in response to electrical stimulation; their opening allows [[calcium]] to flow down its [[electrochemical gradient]] and into the cell. Activation of the L-type channel also causes a mechanical interaction between it and [[ryanodine receptor|calcium-release channels]] located on the adjacent [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] membrane.

In [[skeletal muscle]], the influx of calcium through the L-type calcium channel on the T-tubule contributes little to excitation-contraction coupling, whereas it is crucial to the proper function of [[cardiac muscle]] (''see [[Cardiac action potential]]''). Conversely, the mechanical interaction between the T-tubule's L-type calcium channel and the calcium-release channel is critical to proper [[muscle contraction|skeletal muscle contraction]], whereas it contributes little to the contraction of cardiac muscle.

==Detubulation==
It is possible to physically and functionally uncouple T-tubules from the surface membrane using a technique known as ''detubulation''. This relies on osmotically active chemicals, such as [[glycerol]] (for [[skeletal muscle]]) or [[formamide]] (mainly for [[cardiac muscle]]). Addition of these chemicals to the solution surrounding muscle cells causes the cells to shrink; when the chemical is withdrawn the cells rapidly expand before returning to their normal size. The rapid expansion is thought to cause the t-tubules to detach from the surface membrane, which reseals, and to reseal within the cell. This technique can be used to investigate the function of the t-tubules.

There is some evidence that heart failure precipitates the loss of the T-tubule network, again indicating their importance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
