A '''lipoma''' is a [[benign tumor]] composed of [[adipose tissue]] (body fat). It is the most common form of [[soft tissue]] tumor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bancroft LW, Kransdorf MJ, Peterson JJ, O'Connor MI |title=Benign fatty tumors: classification, clinical course, imaging appearance, and treatment |journal=Skeletal Radiol. |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=719–33 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16927086 |doi=10.1007/s00256-006-0189-y}}</ref> Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually movable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in younger adults and children. Some sources claim that malignant transformation can occur,<ref name=Schepens>[http://www.hms.harvard.edu/news/pressreleases/Schepens/0400ObesityGene.html 'Obesity Gene' Causes Cancer of Fat Tissue, Schepens Scientists Find] Schepens Eye Research Institute (Harvard Medical School affiliate).

==Prevalence==
[[Image:Lipoma.JPG|right|thumb|Lipoma removed from human torso]]

Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma.<ref name=emedicine2720>{{EMedicine|med|2720|Lipomas}}</ref> These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old.<ref name=Salam>{{cite journal |author=Salam GA |title=Lipoma excision |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=901–4 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11898962 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020301/901.html}}</ref> Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease [[Bannayan-Zonana syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buisson P, Leclair MD, Jacquemont S, ''et al.'' |title=Cutaneous lipoma in children: 5 cases with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome |journal=J.

==Causes==
The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as [[lipomatosis|familial multiple lipomatosis]], may include lipoma development.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leffell DJ, Braverman IM |title=Familial multiple lipomatosis. Report of a case and a review of the literature |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=15 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=275–9 |year=1986 |month=August |pmid=3745530 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(86)70166-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Toy BR |title=Familial multiple lipomatosis |journal=Dermatol.

These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between ''HMG I-C'' and [[mesenchymal tumour|mesenchymal tumor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Arlotta P, Tai AK, Manfioletti G, Clifford C, Jay G, Ono SJ. |title= Transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of the high mobility group I-C protein develop adiposity and an abnormally high prevalence of lipomas |journal=J Biol Chem.|volume=275|issue=19 |pages=14394–400|year=2000|month=May |pmid=10747931 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M000564200}}</ref>

Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called "post-traumatic lipomas."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Signorini M, Campiglio GL |title=Posttraumatic lipomas: where do they really come from? |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=699–705 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9500386 |doi=10.1097/00006534-199803000-00017}}</ref> However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aust MC, Spies M, Kall S, Jokuszies A, Gohritz A, Vogt P |title=Posttraumatic lipoma: fact or fiction? |journal=Skinmed |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=266–70 |year=2007 |pmid=17975353 |url=http://www.lejacq.com/articleDetail.cfm?pid=SKINmed_6;6:266 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-9740.2007.06361.x}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for [[histopathology]] to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a [[liposarcoma]].<ref name=emedicine2720/> This last point can be important as the actual identity of a "bump" is not known until after it is removed and professionally examined.

Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision.<ref name=Salam/> The removal can often be done under local anaesthetic, and take less than 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewmylife.co.uk/blog/2009/08/03/lipoma-and-cyst-removal-surgery/ |title=Lipoma removal surgery |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref> This cures the majority of cases, with about 1–2% of lipomas recurring after excision.<ref name=Dalal>{{cite journal |author=Dalal KM, Antonescu CR, Singer S |title=Diagnosis and management of lipomatous tumors |journal=J Surg Oncol |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=298–313 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18286473 |doi=10.1002/jso.20975}}</ref> [[Liposuction]] is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small [[connective tissue]] component. Liposuction typically results in less [[scar]]ring; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to regrowth.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Al-basti HA, El-Khatib HA |title=The use of suction-assisted surgical extraction of moderate and large lipomas: long-term follow-up |journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=114–7 |year=2002 |pmid=12016495 |doi=10.1007/s00266-002-1492-1}}</ref>

There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger [[lipolysis]], such as [[steroid]]s or [[phosphatidylcholine]].<ref name=Salam/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bechara FG, Sand M, Sand D, ''et al.'' |title=Lipolysis of lipomas in patients with familial multiple lipomatosis: an ultrasonography-controlled trial |journal=J Cutan Med Surg |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=155–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17234112}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding, [[Peptic ulcer|ulceration]] and painful obstructions (so-called "malignant by location", despite being a benign growth histologically).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson WM |title=Imaging and findings of lipomas of the gastrointestinal tract |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=184 |issue=4 |pages=1163–71 |date=1 April 2005|pmid=15788588 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15788588 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Taylor AJ, Stewart ET, Dodds WJ |title=Gastrointestinal lipomas: a radiologic and pathologic review |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=155 |issue=6 |pages=1205–10 |date=1 December 1990|pmid=2122666 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2122666 }}</ref> Malignant transformation of lipomas into [[liposarcoma]]s is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions,<ref name=Dalal/> although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milgram JW |title=Malignant transformation in bone lipomas |journal=Skeletal Radiol. |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=347–52 |year=1990 |pmid=2165632 |doi=10.1007/BF00193088}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lowe BA, Brewer J, Houghton DC, Jacobson E, Pitre T |title=Malignant transformation of angiomyolipoma |journal=J.

==In veterinary medicine==
Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers.<ref name=Merck/> Overweight female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma.<ref>[http://www.purinaone.com.au/Article/articledetails.aspx?id=753 Lipomas] Veterinary & Aquatic Services Department, Purina</ref><ref name=vt.edu>[http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/curriculum/vm8304/lab_companion/histo-path/introhistopath/Lab9/Lesions/lipoma.htm Lipoma] Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</ref> In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs.<ref name=Merck>[http://merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/72220.htm Adipose Tissue Tumors] The Merck Veterinary Manual, (9th ed.)</ref> Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, and rarely in cats and pigs.<ref name=vt.edu /><ref>[http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/dogdiseasesl/a/lipomas.htm Lipomas (Fatty Tumors)] Veterinary Q & A</ref> However, a pedunculated lipoma can cause entrapment and torsion of the intestine in horses, causing necrosis, colic, and possibly death.

==Other conditions involving lipomas==
[[Lipomatosis]] is believed to be a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas are present on the body.

[[Adiposis dolorosa]] (Dercum disease) is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, post-menopausal women.<ref name=emedicine242>{{EMedicine|derm|242|Lipomas}}</ref>

[[Benign symmetric lipomatosis]] (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
