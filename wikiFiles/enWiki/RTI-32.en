'''(–)-2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(4-[[tolyl]])tropane''' ('''RTI-32''', '''tolpane''') is a [[phenyltropane]]-based [[cocaine]] analog that is important in the field of [[medicinal chemistry]] for performing [[Structure-activity relationship|SAR]]. 

It has similar properties ''in vitro'' to related drugs such as [[RTI-31]].<ref>Remy P, Doder M, Lees A, Turjanski N, Brooks D. Depression in Parkinson's disease: loss of dopamine and noradrenaline innervation in the limbic system. [http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/128/6/1314 Brain. 2005 Jun;128(Pt 6):1314-22.] PMID 15716302</ref>

Whereas the potency of RTI-31 has been quoted as being as high as 64 x cocaine, RTI-32 is not anything like this strong.
