{{Politics of Hungary}}

A '''referendum on revoking some medical and tuition fees''' was held in [[Hungary]] on 9 March 2008.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p899 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7</ref> The proposals would cancel government reforms which introduced doctor visit fees paid per visitation and medical fees paid per number of days spent in hospital as well as tuition fees in higher education. All three were supported by a majority of voters.<ref name=DN/> The Prime Minister stated that the fees would be abolished on 1 April 2008 following the referendum, but that the government had no funds available to replace the income lost for the higher educations institutions and health institutions due to the abolishment of the fees.

==Background==
The referendum was initiated by opposition party [[Fidesz]] against the ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP). The procedure for the referendum started on 23 October 2006, when Viktor Orbán, the leader of Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union announced they would hand in seven questions to the National Electorate Office, three of which (on abolishing [[co-payment]]s, daily fees and college tuition fees) were officially approved on 17 December 2007 and called on 24 January 2008. It is assumed likely that the referendum will pass, but it is uncertain whether turnout will be high enough to make it valid;<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/6344430.html "Hungarian president announces referendum date"], Xinhua (''People's Daily Online''), 24 January 2008.</ref> polls indicate about 40% turnout with 80% in favour of rescinding the three reforms.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6368962.html Hungary's ruling MSZP vows to stick to medical reforms despite referendum - People's Daily Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

To be valid, the referendum required at least 25% of the about 8 million eligible voters to vote in favour of one of the options.

==Questions==
