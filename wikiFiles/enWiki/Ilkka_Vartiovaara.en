'''Ilkka Juhani Vartiovaara''' (February 14, 1946 [[Helsinki]] – April 10, 2010 [[Vantaa]]) was a Finnish medical doctor, author, editor, artist and columnist. He specialized in [[psychiatry]], but never worked as a psychiatrist, because he was more keen on being a writer. He served as the editor in chief of ''Medisiinari'', ''Suomen Lääkärilehti'' (Finnish Medical Journal) and ''Terveys 2000''. He also illustrated these publications with his drawings.

Vartiovaara authored more than 20 books, including both medical textbooks and collections of his magazine columns and essays discussing medicine from a more humanistic perspective. Several of these titles were about stress and [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]], a concept he is credited for originally bringing to Finland in 1984.<ref name=hs>{{cite web | title = Ilkka Vartiovaara - Muistokirjoitus | url = http://muistot.hs.fi/muistokirjoitus/3409/ilkka-vartiovaara | publisher = ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]''}}</ref>
