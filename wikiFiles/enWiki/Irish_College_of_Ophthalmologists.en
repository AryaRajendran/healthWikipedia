The '''Irish College of Ophthalmologists''' or '''ICO''' is the recognised body for [[ophthalmology]] training in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  Founded in 1991, it represents over 200 ophthalmologists in Ireland and Europe.<ref>http://www.eyedoctors.ie/about/</ref>  Its current president is Ms. Patricia Logan.<ref>http://www.imt.ie/opinion/2011/10/the-national-screening-programme-presents-a-fantastic-opportunity.html</ref>  Dr. Denise Curtin serves as [[Dean (education)|Dean]].

==Education==
In conjunction with the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI), the ICO oversees postgraduate medical and surgical ophthalmology training in Ireland.  The ICO is a recognised training body of the [[Irish Medical Council]].<ref>http://www.medicalcouncil.ie/Registration/First-Time-Applicants/Specialist-Registration/Category-E/Postgraduate-Training-Bodies/</ref>  Its remit includes approval of hospital training posts.<ref>http://rveeh.ie/rveeh/education/Ophthalmology.html</ref>  As part of its international activities, the College is twinned with the [[New England Ophthalmological Society]].<ref>http://www.neos-eyes.org/meetings/30</ref>  In 2011, the ICO introduced an online Professional Competency Scheme, to comply with new legislation and Irish Medical Council regulations.<ref>http://www.imt.ie/news/2011/03/medical-council-announces-pc-schemes-enrolment-fees.html</ref><ref>http://www.imn.ie/view/32-clinical-news/3961-professional-competence-schemes-at-the-rcsi</ref>  The ICO also collaborates with the [[Health Service Executive]]<ref>http://www.ncbi.ie/about-ncbi/ncbi-publications/cost-of-sight-loss-report-2011/full-report/cost-effectiveness-analysis/screening-people-with-diabet</ref> and engages in outreach and education for patients and the general public.

==Training scheme==
The ICO and RCSI supervise and co-ordinate the two strands of the ophthalmology training programme in Ireland: Basic Surgical Training (BST) and Higher Surgical Training (HST).  Completion of a pre-registration intern year is required before applying for ophthalmology training.

===BST===
The BST programme involves rotating through various sub-specialities.  Trainees work as [[Senior House Officer]]s over a minimum of three years at hospital sites in one of three combinations:
*1:  [[Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital]] (RVEEH) and [[Sligo General Hospital]]
*2:  [[Mater Misericordiae University Hospital]], [[University Hospital Galway]], and [[Waterford Regional Hospital]]
*3:  [[Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick]] and [[Cork University Hospital]]
Formal training includes use of surgical simulators, continuous assessment and a mandatory [[human factors]] course.<ref>http://www.irishmedicaltraining.ie/Specialties/Pages/Ophthalmology.aspx</ref>  During the BST, trainees sit examinations at RVEEH to gain Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the MRCSI (Ophth) qualification.<ref>http://www.rcsi.ie/index.jsp?p=240&n=753</ref>  At the end of the BST, successful trainees receive the Certificate of Completion of Basic Surgical Training (CCBST), with which they may apply for the competitive HST programme.

===HST===
The HST scheme is a pre-requisite for obtaining a post as a [[Consultant (medicine)|hospital consultant]].  HST lasts four-and-a-half years and covers seven core sub-specialities:
* [[oculoplastics|oculoplastic]], [[Accessory visual structures|adnexal]], and [[lacrimal]] surgery
* [[cornea]] and external diseases
* [[cataract]] and [[refractive surgery]]
* [[glaucoma]]
* [[retina]], [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]], [[uvea]], and [[Eye neoplasm|ocular oncology]]
* [[neuro-ophthalmology]]
* [[Pediatric ophthalmology|paediatric ophthalmology]] and [[strabismus]]
Trainees are assessed every 6 months and in their final year must complete a [[Fellow#Medical_Education_Systems_in_the_United_Kingdom.2C_Canada.2C_Australia_and_New_Zealand|fellowship]] exam, the FRCSI (Ophth).  This exit exam comprises a one hour [[Oral exam|viva voce]] and a written test.  Successful candidates also receive the Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST).

==Research==
The ICO holds an annual international conference<ref>http://www.medicalindependent.ie/event.aspx?title=irish_college_of_ophthalmologists_annual_conference</ref> where members and guests present research abstract, talks and posters. From 2000-2011, the annual ICO/[[Pfizer]] Research Fellowship was presented at the conference.  The award sponsored [[non-consultant hospital doctor|trainee doctors]] to undertake research in ophthalmology.<ref>http://www.eyedoctors.ie/press-clipping/Irish%20Medical%20Times%2020.05.11.jpg</ref>
