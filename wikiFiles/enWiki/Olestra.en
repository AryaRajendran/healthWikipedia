'''Olestra''' (also known by its brand name '''Olean''') is a fat substitute that adds no fat, calories, or cholesterol to products. It has been used in the preparation of traditionally high-fat foods such as [[potato chip]]s, thereby lowering or eliminating their fat content. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) originally approved olestra for use as a replacement for fats and oils in prepackaged ready-to-eat snacks in 1996,<ref name="AccessData">[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.867 FDA Regulations (at 172.867)]</ref> concluding that such use “meets the safety standard for food additives, reasonable certainty of no harm.”<ref name="Pg.46399">[http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/03-19508.pdf FDA Docket]; see page 46399.</ref> In the late 1990s, Olestra lost its popularity due to side effects, but products containing the ingredient can still be purchased at grocery stores in some countries.

== Commercialization ==

Olestra was accidentally discovered by [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G) researchers F. Mattson and R. Volpenhein in 1968 while researching fats that could be more easily digested by premature infants.<ref name=n340>Nestle, p. 340</ref> In 1971, P&G met with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to examine what sort of testing would be required to introduce olestra as a [[food additive]].<ref name=n341>Nestle, p. 341</ref>

During the following tests, P&G noticed a decline in blood [[cholesterol]] levels as a side effect of olestra replacing natural dietary fats. Following this potentially lucrative possibility, in 1975, P&G filed a new request with the FDA to use olestra as a "drug", specifically to lower cholesterol levels.<ref name=n341/> However, the lengthy series of studies that followed failed to demonstrate the 15% reduction required by the FDA to be approved as a treatment. Further work on olestra languished.

In 1984, the FDA allowed [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg]] to publicly claim their high-fiber [[breakfast cereal]]s were effective in reducing the risk of [[cancer]]. P&G immediately started another test series that lasted three years. When these tests were completed, P&G filed for approval as a food additive for up to 35% replacement of fats in home cooking and 75% in commercial uses.<ref name=n341/>

One of the main concerns the FDA had about olestra was it might encourage consumers to eat more of the "[[food guide pyramid|top of the pyramid]]" foods due to the perception of its being healthier. This could result in consumers engaging in over-consumption, thinking the addition of olestra would remove negative consequences.<ref>Nestle, 339-340</ref> In light of this fact, approving it as an additive would have meant consumers would be consuming a food with a relatively high amount of an additive, whose long-term health effects were not documented. This made the FDA particularly hesitant to approve the product, as well as the side effects, such as [[diarrhea]], and concern for the loss of fat-soluble vitamins.<ref name=n340/> In August 1990, P&G narrowed their focus to "savory snacks", [[potato chip]]s, [[tortilla chip]]s, [[cracker (food)|cracker]]s and similar foods.

By this point, the original patents were getting close to their 1995 expiration, so P&G lobbied for an extension, which they received in December 1993. This extension lasted until 25 January 1996.<ref name=history/> Under pressure, the approval was finally granted on 24 January, one day before the patent ran out, thereby automatically extending the patent another two years.<ref name=history>[http://www.cspinet.org/olestra/history.html "A Brief History of Olestra"], CSPI</ref>

At the time of the 1996 ruling, FDA concluded that, “to avoid being misbranded…olestra-containing foods would need to bear a label statement to inform consumers about possible effects of olestra on the gastrointestinal system. The label statement also would clarify that the added vitamins were present to compensate for any nutritional effects of olestra, rather than to provide enhanced nutritional value.” <ref name="Pg. 46364">[http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/03-19508.pdf FDA Docket]; see page 46364.</ref> The FDA later removed the label saying that the “current label does not accurately communicate information to consumers.”<ref name="Pg. 46387"> [http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/03-19508.pdf FDA Docket]; see page 46387.</ref> The FDA also agreed with P&G that the “label statement could be misleading and cause consumers of olestra to attribute serious problems to olestra when this unlikely to be the case.” <ref name="Pg. 46397">[http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/03-19508.pdf FDA Docket]; see page 46397. </ref>   

Olestra was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a food additive in 1996, and was initially used in potato chips under the [[WOW brand]] by [[Frito Lay]]. In 1998, the first year olestra products were marketed nationally after the FDA's Food Advisory Committee confirmed a judgment it made two years earlier, sales were over $400 million.<ref>Nestle, p. 338</ref> By 2000, though, sales slowed to $200 million.  P&G abandoned attempts to widen the uses of olestra, and sold off its [[Cincinnati]]-based factory to Twin Rivers Technologies in February 2002.<ref name=history/>

As of 2013, the [[Lay's]] Light chips was still available, listing olestra as an ingredient.<ref name=label>[http://www.fritolay.com/assets/images/bigVault/lays-light-original_1__1_.gif "Nutrition Facts Label"]</ref> [[Pringles]] Light potato crisps, manufactured by [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], use Olean brand olestra.

== Side effects ==
Starting in 1996, an FDA-mandated health warning label read "This Product Contains Olestra. Olestra may cause [[abdomen|abdominal]] [[cramp]]ing and loose [[feces|stool]]s. Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and other nutrients. Vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]] have been added."<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00524.html "FDA approves fat substitute, Olestra"], retrieved December 6th, 2006</ref>

These symptoms, normally occurring only by excessive consumption in a short period of time, are known as [[steatorrhea]], and caused by an excess of fat in stool. 

The FDA removed the warning requirement in 2003, as it had "conducted a scientific review of several post-market studies submitted by P&G, as well as adverse event reports submitted by P&G and the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]. The FDA concluded the label statement was no longer warranted",<ref name=label>(deadlink)
[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01245.html "FDA Changes Labeling Requirement for Olestra"]. Retrieved October 12, 2007.</ref> in spite of having received over 20,000 complaints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/new/200308011.html |title=FDA Caves in on Olestra |publisher=Cspinet.org |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> The FDA also agreed with P&G that the “label statement could be misleading and cause consumers of olestra to attribute serious problems to olestra when this [was] unlikely to be the case.” <ref name="Pg. 46397"> [http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/03-19508.pdf FDA Docket]; see page 46397. </ref>  

When removing the olestra warning label, the FDA cited a six-week P&G study of more than 3000 people showing the olestra-eating group experienced only a small increase in [[Defecation|bowel movement frequency]] compared to the control group.<ref name=label/>  The FDA concluded that “subjects eating olestra-containing chips were no more likely to report having had loose stools, abdominal cramps, or any other GI symptom compared to subjects eating an equivalent amount of [potato] chips.”<ref name="Pg. 46372">[http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/03-19508.pdf FDA Docket]; see page 46372.</ref>   

In addition to the effects of the health warnings on public acceptance of the product, olestra might not have lived up to consumer expectations of speedy results.  If consumers believed they could eat more to compensate for the fat calories "saved," olestra would not be an effective way to improve overall diet.<ref>Nestle, p. 353</ref>  The manufacturers claim that the authentic taste and feel of olestra offsets this tendency,<ref>{{cite web

|publisher=
|url=http://www.olean.com/default.asp?p=faq
|accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref> and some studies have shown that people who consume foods with olestra don’t eat more to offset the loss in calories. <ref name="Two Weeks"> [Bray, G., Sparti, A., et al. Effect of Two Weeks Fat Replacement by Olestra on Food Intake and Energy Metabolism FASEB J 1995;9:A439 (abstr).]</ref> P&G conducted publicity campaigns to highlight olestra's benefits, including working directly with the health-care community.<ref>Nestle, p. 351</ref>

Olestra is unapproved for sale in many countries, including the European Union and Canada.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/06/23/fin_canadian_ban_adds_to.html|title=Canadian ban adds to woes for P&G's olestra|last=Peale|first=Cliff|date=June 23, 2000|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthyandhot.com/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_olestra.htm|title=Everything you wanted to know about Olestra|date=2007-08-23|work=Healthy and Hot|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>

Consumption of Olestra promotes weight gain in rats receiving high-fat diets. Rats that were fed regular potato chips as well as chips cooked with Olestra gained more weight than rats that received just regular chips. Olestra-fed rats maintained their higher weight even after both groups received just regular fatty foods.<ref>Swithers, S. E., Ogden, S. B., & Davidson, T. L. (2011, June 20). Fat Substitutes Promote Weight Gain in Rats Consuming High-Fat Diets. Behavioral Neuroscience. Advance online publication. doi: 10.1037/a0024404 [http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-12290-001].</ref>

== Chemistry ==
[[Triglyceride]]s, the energy-yielding dietary [[fat]]s, consist of three [[fatty acid]]s bonded to a [[glycerol]] "backbone". Because olestra is synthesized from [[sucrose]], it can bond with six, seven, or eight fatty acids.<ref>[http://chemmovies.unl.edu/chem_source_pdf/FOOD.pdf ''Food and Chemistry''], [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]], 1993, p. 29. Retrieved 6 November 2007.</ref> The resulting radial arrangement is too large and irregular to move through the intestinal wall and be absorbed. Olestra has the same taste and [[mouthfeel]] as fat, but it passes through the [[gastrointestinal tract]] undigested without contributing calories or nutritive value to the diet.

From a mechanical point of view, scientists were able to manipulate the compound in such a way that it could be used in place of cooking oils in the preparation of many types of food.<ref name=n340/>

Since it contains fatty acid [[functional group]]s, olestra is able to dissolve lipid-soluble [[vitamins]], such as [[vitamin D]], [[vitamin E]], [[vitamin K]], and [[vitamin A]], along with [[carotenoid]]s. Fat-soluble nutrients consumed with olestra products are excreted with the undigested olestra molecules. To counteract this loss of nutrients, products made with olestra are fortified with oil-soluble vitamins.<ref>[http://www.cspinet.org/olestra/11cons.html "The Problems With Olestra"], Center for Science in the Public Interest</ref>

In 1999, researchers discovered olestra helps facilitate the removal of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] from the body, as it apparently binds to dioxins in a manner similar to that of normal fats. This unexpected side effect may make the substance useful in treating victims of dioxin poisoning.<ref>[http://www.ehponline.org/members/2001/109p865-869geusau/geusau-full.html Severe 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) Intoxication: Clinical and Laboratory Effects] retrieved December 6th, 2006</ref><ref>[http://healthnews.uc.edu/publications/findings/?/466/1576/ "Olestra Could Be Antidote to Toxins"], University of Columbus Health News, 2005.</ref>

Recent research by groups at [[University of Cincinnati]] School of Medicine in [[Ohio]] and the [[University of Western Australia]] indicates olestra can be used to treat poisoning due to exposure to [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), including [[chloracne]] symptoms.<ref name="ref4">{{cite journal |author=Redgrave TG, Wallace P, Jandacek RJ, Tso P |title=Treatment with a dietary fat substitute decreased Arochlor 1254 contamination in an obese diabetic male |journal=J.
