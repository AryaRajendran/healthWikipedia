Several factors complicate the '''diagnosis of Asperger syndrome''' (AS), an [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD). Like other ASD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is characterized by impairment in [[social interaction]] accompanied by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior; it differs from the other ASDs by having no general [[language delay|delay in language]] or [[cognitive development]]. Problems in diagnosis include disagreement among diagnostic criteria, controversy over the distinction between AS and other ASD forms or even whether AS exists as a separate syndrome, and over- and under-diagnosis for non-technical reasons. As with other ASD forms, early diagnosis is important, and differential diagnosis must consider several other conditions.

==Criteria==

[[Asperger syndrome]] is defined in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV-TR) as a [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by impairment in social interaction, by [[stereotypy|stereotyped]] and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Impairments must be significant, and must affect important areas of function, and the diagnosis is excluded if criteria are also met for autism.<ref name=BehaveNet>{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm |accessdate=2007-06-28 |publisher=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> |location=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> }}</ref> Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided [[verbosity]], restricted [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.<ref name=Klin/> 

The [[World Health Organization]] [[ICD-10]] criteria are almost identical to DSM-IV:<ref name="Fitzgerald"/> ICD-10 adds the statement that motor clumsiness is usual (although not necessarily a diagnostic feature); ICD-10 adds the statement that isolated special skills, often related to abnormal preoccupations, are common but are not required for diagnosis; and the DSM-IV requirement for clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning is not included in ICD-10.<ref name="Mattila">{{cite journal |author=Mattila ML |title=An epidemiological and diagnostic study of Asperger syndrome according to four sets of diagnostic criteria |journal= J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=636–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17450055 |doi=10.1097/chi.0b013e318033ff42 |author-separator=, |author2=Kielinen M |author3=Jussila K |display-authors=3 |last4=Linna |first4=Sirkka-Liisa |last5=Bloigu |first5=Risto |last6=Ebeling |first6=Hanna |last7=Moilanen |first7=Irma}}</ref><ref name="Baskin"/>

Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome can be tricky as there is a lack of a standardized diagnostic screening for the disorder.<ref name=ninds>{{cite web|title=Asperger Syndrome Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm|work=http://www.ninds.nih.gov}}</ref> According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, physicians look for the presence of a primary group of behaviors to make a diagnosis such as abnormal eye contact, aloofness, failure to respond when called by name, failure to use gestures to point or show, lack of interactive play with others, and a lack of interest in peers.

==Reliability==

The diagnoses of AS or [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA) are sometimes used interchangeably; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool and the individual administering the test.<ref name="ninds"/> Diagnoses may be influenced by non-technical issues, such as availability of government benefits for one condition but not the other.<ref>Attwood, T (2003). [http://www.sacramentoasis.com/docs/8-22-03/as_&_hfa.pdf Is There a Difference Between Asperger's Syndrome and High Functioning Autism?] (PDF). Sacramento Asperger Syndrome Information & Support.  Retrieved 2007-08-15.</ref>  Advocacy and parent support organizations have proliferated around the concept of AS, and there are indications that this has resulted in more frequent diagnoses of AS, which may be given as a "residual diagnosis" to children of normal intelligence who do not meet diagnostic criteria for autism but have some social difficulties.<ref name=Klin>{{cite journal |journal= Rev Bras Psiquiatr |year=2006 |volume=28 |issue= suppl 1 |pages=S3–S11 |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview |author= Klin A |doi=10.1590/S1516-44462006000500002 |pmid=16791390 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462006000500002&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>
Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases; the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD|title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|year=2007|volume=13|issue=2|pages=129–35|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143|pmid=17563895}}</ref>

==Procedure==

Developmental screening during a routine check-up by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation. This will require a comprehensive team evaluation to either confirm or exclude a diagnosis of AS. This team usually includes a psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech and language pathologist, occupational therapist and other professionals with expertise in diagnosing children with AS.<ref name="Baskin">{{cite journal |author= Baskin JH, Sperber M, Price BH |title= Asperger syndrome revisited |journal= Rev Neurol Dis |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16596080}}</ref><ref name=ninds />  Observation occurs across multiple settings; the social disability in AS may be more evident during periods when social expectations are unclear and children are free of adult direction.<ref name="McPartland">{{cite journal |author= McPartland J, Klin A |title= Asperger's syndrome |journal= Adolesc Med Clin |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=771–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17030291 |doi=10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010 |doi_brokendate=2008-06-22}}</ref> A comprehensive evaluation includes neurological and genetic assessment, with in-depth cognitive and language testing to establish IQ and evaluate psychomotor function, verbal and nonverbal strengths and weaknesses, style of learning, and skills for independent living.

The determination of whether there is a family history of autism spectrum conditions is important.<ref name="Foster"/>  A medical practitioner will diagnose on the basis of the test results and the child’s developmental history and current symptoms.<ref name=ninds/> Because multiple domains of functioning are involved, a multidisciplinary team approach is critical;<ref name="Fitzgerald"/> an accurate assessment of the individual's strengths and weaknesses is more useful than a diagnostic label.<ref name="McPartland"/> Delayed or mistaken diagnosis is a serious problem that can be traumatic for individuals and families; diagnosis based solely on a neurological, speech and language, or educational attainment may yield only a partial diagnosis.<ref name="Fitzgerald"/>

Advances in genetic technology allow [[Clinical genetics|clinical geneticists]] to link an estimated 40% of ASD cases to genetic causes; in one study the diagnostic yield for AS, [[PDD-NOS]] and atypical autism was similar to that for classic autism.<ref name=Schaefer>{{cite journal |journal= Genet Med |year=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |title= Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |author= Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |pmid=18197051 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laysource= Medical News Today |laydate=2008-02-07}}</ref> Genetic diagnosis is relatively expensive,<ref name=Schaefer/> and genetic screening is generally impractical. As genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

==Early diagnosis==

Parents of children with AS can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age, although diagnosis is not made on average until the age of 11.<ref name="Foster">{{cite journal |author=Foster B, King BH |title=Asperger syndrome: to be or not to be? |journal=Curr. Opin. Pediatr. |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=491–94 |year=2003 |pmid=14508298 |doi=10.1097/00008480-200310000-00008}}</ref>  By definition, children with AS develop language and self-help skills on schedule, so early signs may not be apparent and the condition may not be diagnosed until later childhood.  Impairment in social interaction is sometimes not in evidence until a child attains an age at which these behaviors become important; social disabilities are often first noticed when children encounter peers in daycare or preschool.<ref name="McPartland"/>  Diagnosis is most commonly made between the ages of four and eleven, and one study suggests that diagnosis cannot be rendered reliably before age four.<ref name="McPartland"/>
<!-- This doesn't seem worth mentioning, since PMID 9885399 is about a single case. PMID 11401656 is about how well ASDASQ screens.

This is all I can find on adults:
"As awareness grows, diagnoses are often made in adulthood,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bankier B, Lenz G, Gutierrez K, Bach M, Katschnig H |title=A case of Asperger's syndrome first diagnosed in adulthood |journal=Psychopathology |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=43–6 |year=1999 |pmid=9885399 |doi=10.1159/000029065}} as cited in Baskin (2006), p. 6.</ref> when interventions are valuable but less beneficial. Information regarding the development of AS into adulthood is scarce because there are no longitudinal studies of the AS population."<ref name="Baskin"/>  Is there anything at PMID 11401656
-->

==Differential diagnosis==

Asperger syndrome can be misdiagnosed as a number of other conditions, leading to medications that are unnecessary or even worsen behavior; the condition may be at the root of treatment-resistant mental illness in adults.  Diagnostic confusion burdens individuals and families and may cause them to seek unhelpful therapies.  Conditions that must be considered in a [[differential diagnosis]] include other pervasive developmental disorders (autism, PDD-NOS, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett disorder), [[schizophrenia spectrum]] disorders ([[schizophrenia]], [[schizotypal disorder]], [[Schizoid_personality_disorder#Differential_diagnosis|schizoid personality disorder]]), [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[semantic pragmatic disorder]], [[Multiple-complex Developmental Disorder|multiple complex developmental disorder]] and [[nonverbal learning disorder]] (NLD).<ref name="Fitzgerald"/>

Differentiating between AS and other ASDs relies on the judgment of experienced clinicians.<ref name="McPartland"/> There is much overlap between AS and NLD: both have symptoms of precocious reading, verbosity, and clumsiness, but they differ in that children with AS have restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, and less-typical social interactions.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Stein MT, Klin A, Miller K, Goulden K, Coolman R, Coolman DM |title= When Asperger's syndrome and a nonverbal learning disability look alike |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=190–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15194904 |doi= 10.1097/00004703-200406000-00008}}</ref> [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) should also be considered in differential diagnosis:  "It is in nonretarded, rigid individuals on the autistic spectrum, especially those with so-called Asperger syndrome, that differences with less severely affected individuals with TS and OCD may become blurred, or that both disorders may coexist."<ref name="RapinTS">{{cite journal |author=Rapin I |title=Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome |journal=Advances in neurology |volume=85 |pages=89–101 |year=2001 |pmid=11530449}}</ref>
Other problems to be considered in the differential diagnosis include [[selective mutism]], [[stereotypic movement disorder]] and [[bipolar disorder]]<ref name="Foster"/> as well as [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[childbirth|birth]] [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[conduct disorder]], [[Cornelia De Lange syndrome]], [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], [[fragile X syndrome]], [[dyslexia]], [[Fahr's syndrome|Fahr syndrome]], [[hyperlexia]], [[leukodystrophy]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Triple X syndrome]].<ref name=emed>Brasic, JR.

Compared with the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria, the requirements of normal early language and cognitive development are not mentioned by Szatmari ''et al.'', whereas [[language delay]] is allowed in the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria. Szatmari ''et al.'' emphasize solitariness, and both Gillberg and Szatmari include "odd speech" and "language" in their criteria.  Although Szatmari does not mention stereotyped behaviors, one of four described stereotyped functions is required by DSM-IV and ICD-10, and two are required by Gillberg and Gillberg.  Abnormal responses to [[sensory integration|sensory stimuli]] are not mentioned in any diagnostic scheme, although they have been associated with AS.<ref name="Mattila"/> Because DSM-IV and ICD-10 exclude speech and language difficulties, these definitions exclude some of the original cases described by Hans Asperger. According to one researcher, the majority of individuals with AS do have speech and language abnormalities, and the recent DSM–IV says that "the occurrence of 'no clinically significant delays in language does not imply that individuals with Asperger Disorder have no problems with communication' (American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 80)".<ref name="Fitzgerald"/> The Gillberg and Gillberg criteria are considered closest to Asperger's original description of the syndrome;<ref name="Fitzgerald">{{cite journal |author= Fitzgerald M, Corvin A |year=2001 |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/7/4/310 |title= Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Asperger syndrome |journal= Adv Psychiatric Treat |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=310–8 |doi= 10.1192/apt.7.4.310}}</ref> the aggression and abnormal [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] that other authors say defined Asperger's patients are not mentioned in any criteria.<ref name="Baskin"/><ref name="McPartland"/><ref name="Hippler">{{cite journal |author=Hippler K, Klicpera C |title=A retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of 'autistic psychopaths' diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the University Children's Hospital, Vienna |journal=Philos.

==Proposed changes to DSM-5==

One of the proposed changes to [[DSM-5]] is to do away with Asperger syndrome as a separate diagnosis and fold it under autism spectrum disorders, with severity measures within the broader diagnosis.<ref>{{cite news |title=A powerful identity, a vanishing diagnosis |author=Wallis C |work=New York Times |date=2009-11-02 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html }}</ref>

In the proposed revision, individuals must meet the criteria in sections A, B, C and D to receive a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder .<ref name=dsm5>{{cite web|title=Proposed Revision|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}</ref> 
 
A.    Deficits in social communication and interaction not caused by general developmental delays. Must have all 3 areas of symptoms present.<ref name=dsm5 />

1) Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity; failure to have a back and forth conversation.<ref name=dsm5 />

2) Deficits in nonverbal communication such as abnormal eye contact and body language or difficulty using and understanding nonverbal communication, and lack of facial expressions or gestures.<ref name=dsm5 />

3) Deficits in creating and maintaining relationships appropriate to developmental level (apart from relationships with caregivers). This may include trouble adjusting behavior to suit different social contexts, difficulties with imaginative play and making friends, and a lack of interest in other people.<ref name=dsm5 />

B. Demonstration of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interest or activities. Must present two of the following.<ref name=dsm5 />

1) Repetitive speech, repetitive motor movements or repetitive use of objects (echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).<ref name=dsm5 />

2) Adherence to routines, ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior, or strong resistance to change (insists on eating the same food, repetitive questioning, or great distress at small changes).<ref name=dsm5 />

3) Fixated interests that are abnormally intense of focus (strong attachment to unusual objects, restricted interests).<ref name=dsm5 />

4) Over or under reactivity to sensory input or abnormal interest in sensory aspects of environment (such as indifference to pain, heat or cold, negative response to certain sounds or textures, extreme smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or spinning objects).<ref name=dsm5 />

C. Symptoms must be present in early childhood (May not become apparent until social demand exceeds limited capacity).<ref name=dsm5 />

D. Symptoms collectively limit and hinder everyday functioning.<ref name=dsm5 />

The proposed removal of Asperger’s Syndrome from the DSM has been controversial as it is commonly used by health insurers, researchers, state agencies, schools, and individuals with the disorder.<ref name=claudia>{{cite web|last=Wallis|first=Claudia|title=A Vanishing Diagnosis for Asperger's Syndrome|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref>  Experts are concerned that eliminating the Asperger’s label will prevent mildly affected people from being evaluated for Autism.<ref name=claudia />
