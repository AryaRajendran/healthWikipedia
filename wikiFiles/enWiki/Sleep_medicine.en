'''Sleep medicine''' is a medical specialty or [[subspecialty]] devoted to the diagnosis and [[therapy]] of [[sleep]] disturbances and [[sleep disorder|disorders]]. From the middle of the 20th century, research has provided increasing knowledge and answered many questions about sleep-wake functioning.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/waking-up-to-sleep |title=Waking Up To Sleep |accessdate= 2008-01-25 |last=Bingham |first=Roger |coauthors=Terrence Sejnowski, Jerry Siegel, Mark Eric Dyken, Charles Czeisler, Paul Shaw, Ralph Greenspan, Satchin Panda, Philip Low, Robert Stickgold, Sara Mednick, Allan Pack, Luis de Lecea, David Dinges, Dan Kripke, Giulio Tononi |date=February 2007 |format=Several conference videos |publisher=The Science Network}}</ref> The rapidly evolving field<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Kvale |first=Paul A. |coauthors=Peter D.

==Scope and classification==
{{Main|Sleep disorders}}
Competence in sleep medicine requires an understanding of a plethora of very diverse disorders, many of which present with similar [[symptom]]s such as [[excessive daytime sleepiness]], which, in the absence of volitional [[sleep deprivation]], "is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder," such as sleep apnea, [[narcolepsy]], [[idiopathic hypersomnia]], [[Kleine-Levin syndrome]], menstrual-related [[hypersomnia]], [[idiopathic]] recurrent stupor, or [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders|circadian rhythm disturbances]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mahowald |first=M.W. |date=March 2000 |title=What is causing excessive daytime sleepiness?: evaluation to distinguish sleep deprivation from sleep disorders |journal=Postgraduate Medicine |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=108–23 |doi= 10.3810/pgm.2000.03.932 |url=http://www.postgradmed.com/issues/2000/03_00/mahowald.shtml |accessdate=2008-07-27 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080530012343/http://www.postgradmed.com/issues/2000/03_00/mahowald.shtml |archivedate=May 30, 2008 |pmid=10728139}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mahowald |first=M.W. |date=March 2000 |title=What is causing excessive daytime sleepiness?: evaluation to distinguish sleep deprivation from sleep disorders |journal=Postgraduate Medicine |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=108–23 |doi=10.3810/pgm.2000.03.932 |url=http://websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?issn=20000869 |accessdate=2008-10-06 |pmid=10728139}}</ref> Another common complaint is [[insomnia]], a set of symptoms that can have many causes, physical and mental. Management in the varying situations differs greatly and cannot be undertaken without a correct diagnosis.

ICSD, ''The [[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]]'',<ref>{{Cite book |last=American Academy of Sleep Medicine |title=International classification of sleep disorders, revised: Diagnostic and coding manual |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927034423/http://www.absm.org/PDF/ICSD.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927034423/http://www.absm.org/PDF/ICSD.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |format=PDF, 208 pgs |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=American Academy of Sleep Medicine |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=0-9657220 |year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Thorpy MJ |title=Which clinical conditions are responsible for impaired alertness? |journal=Sleep Med. |volume=6 Suppl 1 |pages=S13–20 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16140241 |doi=10.1016/S1389-9457(05)80004-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(05)80004-8}}</ref> was restructured in 1990, in relation to its predecessor, to include only one code for each diagnostic entry and to classify disorders by [[pathophysiologic]] mechanism, as far as possible, rather than by primary complaint. Training in sleep medicine is multidisciplinary, and the present structure was chosen to encourage a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis. Sleep disorders often do not fit neatly into traditional classification; [[differential diagnoses]] cross medical systems. Minor revisions and updates to the ICSD were made in 1997 and in following years. The present classification system in fact follows the groupings suggested by [[Nathaniel Kleitman]], the "father of sleep research," in his seminal 1939 book ''Sleep and Wakefulness''.

The revised ICSD, ICSD-R, placed the primary sleep disorders in the subgroups (1) [[dyssomnias]], which include those that produce complaints of insomnia or excessive sleepiness, and (2) the [[parasomnias]], which do not produce those primary complaints but intrude into or occur during sleep. A further subdivision of the dyssomnias preserves the integrity of [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders]], as was mandated by about 200 doctors and researchers from all over the world who participated in the process between 1985–1990. The last two subgroups were (3) the medical or psychiatric sleep disorder section and (4) the proposed new disorders section. The authors found the heading "medical or psychiatric" less than ideal but better than the alternative "organic or non-organic," which seemed more likely to change in the future. Detailed reporting schemes aimed to provide data for further research. A second edition, called ICSD-2, was published in 2005.

MeSH, ''[[Medical Subject Headings]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html |title=Medical Subject Headings |accessdate=2008-07-27 |date=Updated 14 January 2008}}</ref> a service of the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, uses similar broad categories: (1) dyssomnias, including narcolepsy, apnea, and the circadian rhythm sleep disorders, (2) parasomnias, which include, among others, [[bruxism]] (tooth-grinding), [[sleepwalking]] and [[bedwetting]], and (3) sleep disorders caused by medical or psychiatric conditions. The system used produces "trees," approaching each diagnosis from up to several angles such that each disorder may be known by several codes.

DSM-IV-TR, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition, Text Revision'',<ref name="Bonds">{{eMedicine|med|609|Sleep Disorders}}</ref> using the same [[diagnostic codes]] as the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD), divides sleep disorders into three groups: (1) primary sleep disorders, both the dyssomnias and the parasomnias, presumed to result from an endogenous disturbance in sleep-wake generating or timing mechanisms, (2) those secondary to mental disorders and (3) those related to a general medical condition or substance abuse.

Recent thinking opens for a common cause for [[depression (mood)|mood]] and sleep disorders occurring in the same patient; a 2010 review states that, in humans, "single nucleotide polymorphisms in ''Clock'' and other clock genes have been associated with depression" and that the "evidence that mood disorders are associated with disrupted or at least inappropriately timed circadian rhythms suggests that treatment strategies or drugs aimed at restoring 'normal' circadian rhythmicity may be clinically useful."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kennaway |first=David J. |year=2010 |title=Schizophrenia: a multisystem disease? |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=5–14 |publisher=SagePub |doi=10.1177/1359786810372980 |url=http://jop.sagepub.com/content/24/2_suppl/5 |format=Review |accessdate= 2010-11-05 |pmid=20663803 |pmc=2951587}}</ref>

The concept of sleep medicine belongs to the second half of the 20th century. Due to the rapidly increasing knowledge about sleep, including the growth of the research field [[chronobiology]] from about 1960 and the discoveries of [[REM sleep]] (1952–53) and sleep apnea (first described in the medical literature in 1965), the medical importance of sleep was recognized. The medical community began paying more attention than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the US, and in many western nations within the two following decades, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and the treatment of its disorders had been founded. Most sleep doctors were primarily concerned with apnea; some were experts in narcolepsy. There was as yet nothing to restrict the use of the title "sleep doctor," and a need for standards arose.

Basic medical training has paid little attention to sleep problems;<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18024690 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.2006.111179 | pmc=2095611|title=Clinical diagnosis and misdiagnosis of sleep disorders|year=2007|last1=Stores|first1=G|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry|volume=78|issue=12|pages=1293–7}}</ref> according to Benca in her [[review]] ''Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia'' (2005), most doctors are "not well trained with respect to sleep and sleep disorders," and a survey in 1990–91 of 37 American [[medical school]]s showed that sleep and sleep disorders were "covered" in less than two (2) hours of total teaching time, on average.<ref name="psychservices">{{Cite journal |author=Benca RM |title=Diagnosis and treatment of chronic insomnia: a review |journal= Psychiatr Serv |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=332–43 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15746509 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.56.3.332 |url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/56/3/332}}</ref> Benca's review cites a 2002 survey by Papp et al. of more than 500 [[primary care physician]]s who self-reported their knowledge of sleep disorders as follows: Excellent – 0%; Good – 10%, Fair – 60%; and Poor – 30%. The review of more than 50 studies indicates that both doctors and [[patient]]s appear reluctant to discuss sleep complaints, in part because of perceptions that treatments for insomnia are ineffective or associated with risks, and:
{{Cquote|Physicians may avoid exploring problems such as sleep difficulties in order to avoid having to deal with issues that could take up more than the normal allotted time for a patient.<ref name= "psychservices"/>}}

Also, an editorial in the American College of Chest Physicians' ([[pulmonologist]]s') journal ''CHEST'' in 1999 was quite concerned about the ''Conundrums in Sleep Medicine''. The author, then chair of her organization's Sleep Section, asked "What is required to set up a sleep laboratory? Money and a building! Anyone can open a sleep laboratory, and it seems that just about everyone is."<ref name="Collop"/> On the [[accreditation]] process for sleep laboratories, she continues: "This accreditation, however, is currently not required by most states, or more importantly, by most [[insurance]] carriers for reimbursements... There is also an American Board of Sleep Medicine (ABSM) that certifies individuals as sleep specialists. This certification presumably makes those individuals more qualified to run a sleep laboratory; however, the certification is not required to run a laboratory or to read sleep studies." Her concern at the turn of the century was:
{{Cquote|Not all patients with [[hypersomnia]] have sleep apnea, and other diagnoses may be missed if the physician is only trained to diagnose and treat sleep apnea. Also, when a physician runs a sleep laboratory, they are "assumed" to be a sleep expert and are asked to evaluate and treat all types of sleep disorders when they are not adequately trained to do so.<ref name="Collop">{{Cite journal |author=Collop NA |title= Conundrums in sleep medicine |journal=Chest |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=607–8 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10084459 |doi=10.1378/chest.115.3.607 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10084459}}</ref>}}

In the UK, knowledge of sleep medicine and possibilities for diagnosis and treatment seem to lag. Guardian.co.uk quotes the director of the [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust|Imperial College Healthcare]] Sleep Centre: "One problem is that there has been relatively little training in sleep medicine in this country – certainly there is no structured training for sleep physicians."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Anne |last=Wollenberg |title=Time to wake up to sleep disorders |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/28/health |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref> The Imperial College Healthcare site<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/services/sleepservices/index.htm |title=Sleep services |accessdate=2008-08-02 |year=2008 |publisher=Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust}}</ref> shows attention to [[obstructive sleep apnea]] syndrome (OSA) and very few other disorders, specifically not including insomnia.

==Training and certification==
===Worldwide===
The World Federation of Sleep Research & Sleep Medicine Societies (WFSRSMS) was founded in 1987. As its name implies, members are concerned with basic and clinical research as well as medicine. Member societies in the Americas are the [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] (AASM), the [[Sleep Research Society]] of the United States (SRS), the [[Canadian Sleep Society]] (CSS) and the Federation of Latin American Sleep Societies (FLASS). WFSRSMS publishes the ''Journal of Sleep Research'', the ''Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine'', ''SLEEP'' and ''Sleep and Biological Rhythms'' and promotes both sleep research and physician training and education.

===Africa===
The Colleges of Medicine of South Africa (CMSA) provide the well-defined specialty Diploma in Sleep Medicine of the College of Neurologists of South Africa: DSM(SA),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Diploma in Sleep Medicine of the College of Neurologists of South Africa: DSM(SA) |url=http://www.collegemedsa.ac.za/view_exam.asp?Type=Link&ExamID=103 |accessdate=2010-02-05 |author=The Colleges of Medicine of South Africa (CMSA)}}</ref> which was first promulgated by the Health Professions Council in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=72840 |title=Government Gazette, Board Notices, Raadskennisgewings, BOARD NOTICE 22 OF 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-06 |author=HEALTH PROFESSIONS COUNCIL OF SOUTH AFRICA |date=16 March 2007 |format=PDF}}</ref> The newly formed South African Society of Sleep Medicine (SASSM) was launched at its inaugural congress in February 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sassm.org/ |title=SASSM |accessdate=2010-02-06 |author=The South African Society of Sleep Medicine |year= 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.medical.theconferencewebsite.com/conference-info/SASSM-2010 |title=1st Annual Congress of the South African Society of Sleep Medicine 2010 (SASSM 2010) |accessdate= 2010-02-05 |author=Organising & Scientific Committee |year=2009}}</ref> The society's membership is diverse; it includes general practitioners, [[otolaryngology|ENT]] surgeons, pulmonologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists and psychiatrists.

===Asia===
WFSRSMS members in Asia include the Australasian Sleep Association (ASA) of New Zealand and Australia and the Asian Sleep Research Society (ASRS), an umbrella organization for the societies of several Asian nations.

===Europe===
The European Sleep Research Society (ESRS) is a member of the WFSRSMS. The Assembly of National Sleep Societies (ANSS), which includes both medical and scientific organizations from 26 countries as of 2007, is a formal body of the ESRS. The ESRS has published ''European Accreditation Guidelines for SMCs'' (Sleep Medicine Centres), the first of several proposed guidelines to coordinate and promote sleep science and medicine in Europe.

===United States===
[[File:Sleep Stage N3.png|thumb|250px|[[Polysomnography]] (PSG) is a [[Parametric model|multi-parametric]] test used as a [[diagnostic tool]] in sleep medicine.]]

The [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] (AASM), founded in 1978, administered the certification process and sleep medicine examination for doctors until 1990. Its independent daughter entity the [[American Board of Sleep Medicine]] (ABSM) was incorporated in 1991 and took over the aforementioned responsibilities. As of 2007, the ABSM ceased administering its examination, as it conceded that an examination process recognized by the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS) was advantageous to the field.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.absm.org/about.htm |title=American Board of Sleep Medicine: About the ABSM |accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref> Candidates who passed the ABSM exam in 1978–2006 retain lifetime certification as Diplomates of that organization.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/ABSM.aspx |title= Board Certification in Sleep Medicine – Previous (1978–2006) |accessdate=2008-07-27 |author=American Academy of Sleep Medicine |year=2008}}</ref>

The [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] (ABPN), and the corresponding boards of Internal Medicine, of Pediatrics, and of Otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, ENT) now administer collectively the Sleep Medicine Certification exam for their members. Each board supervises the required 12 months of formal training for its candidates, while the exam is administered to all of them at the same time in the same place. For the first five years, 2007–2011, during "[[grandfathering]]," there was a "practice pathway" for ABSM certified specialists while additional, coordinated requirements were to be added after 2011. The ABPN provides information about the pathways, requirements and the exam on its website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abpn.com/sleep.htm |title=Initial Certification in the Subspecialty of Sleep Medicine |accessdate=2008-07-27 |year=2007–08}}</ref> Additionally, there are currently four boards of the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] that administer Sleep Medicine Certification exams. The American Osteopathic boards of [[American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians|Family Medicine]], [[American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine|Internal Medicine]], [[American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry|Neurology & Psychiatry]], and [[American Osteopathic Board of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology|Ophthalmology & Otolaryngology]] grant certificates of added qualification to qualified candidate physicians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Specialties & Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref>

Sleep medicine is now a recognized subspecialty within [[anesthesiology]], [[internal medicine]], [[family medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[otolaryngology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] in the US. Certification in Sleep Medicine by the several "Member Boards" of the ABMS shows that the specialist:
{{Cquote|has demonstrated expertise in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions that occur during sleep, that disturb sleep, or that are affected by disturbances in the wake–sleep cycle.

Pulmonologists, already subspecialists within internal medicine, may be accepted to sit for the board and be certified in Sleep Medicine after just a six-month [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]], building on their knowledge of sleep-related breathing problems, rather than the usual twelve-month fellowship required of other specialists.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thoracic.org/sections/publications/statements/resources/sleeptraining1-5.pdf |title=Statement about Training of Pulmonary Physicians in Sleep Disorders |accessdate=2008-07-27 |author=Joint, ad hoc committee formed by the American Thoracic Society, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Sleep Disorders Association and the Association of Pulmonary-Critical Care Medicine Program Directors |year=1994 |format=PDF, 5 pgs}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Sleep dentistry ([[bruxism]], snoring and sleep apnea), while not recognized as one of the nine [[dentistry|dental specialties]], qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The resulting Diplomate status is recognized by the AASM, and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aadsm.org/ |title=About AADSM |accessdate=2008-07-22 |year=2008 |publisher=Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine}}</ref> The qualified dentists collaborate with sleep doctors at accredited sleep centers and can provide several types of [[mandibular advancement splint|oral appliances]] or upper airway surgery to treat or manage sleep-related breathing disorders<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abdsm.org/ |title=About the ADBSM |accessdate= 2008-07-22 |publisher=American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine}}</ref> as well as tooth-grinding and clenching.

Laboratories for sleep-related breathing disorders are accredited by the AASM, and are required to follow the ''Code of Medical Ethics'' of the American Medical Association. The new and very detailed ''Standards for Accreditation'' are available online.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/PDF/LaboratoryStandards.pdf |title=Standards for Accreditation of Laboratories for Sleep Related Breathing Disorders. |accessdate=2008-07-27 |date=December 2007 |format=PDF, 17 pgs |publisher=American Academy of Sleep Medicine |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071218191102/http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/PDF/LaboratoryStandards.pdf |archivedate=December 18, 2007}}</ref> Sleep disorder centers, or clinics, are accredited by the same body, whether hospital-based, university-based or "freestanding"; they are required to provide testing and treatment for ''all'' sleep disorders and to have on staff a sleep specialist who has been certified by the American Board of Sleep Medicine and otherwise meet similar standards.

==Diagnostic methods==
[[File:Pediatric polysomnogram.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pediatric [[polysomnography]]]]

The taking of a thorough [[medical history]] while keeping in mind alternative [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and the possibility of more than one ailment in the same patient is the first step. Symptoms for very different sleep disorders may be similar and it must be determined whether any psychiatric problems are primary or secondary.

The patient history includes previous attempts at treatment and coping and a careful medication review. Differentiation of transient from chronic disorders and primary from secondary ones influences the direction of evaluation and treatment plans.<ref name="Cataletto">{{Cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/TOPIC655.HTM |title=Sleeplessness and Circadian Rhythm Disorder |accessdate=2008-08-03 |last= Cataletto |first=Mary E. |coauthors=Gila Hertz |date=September 7, 2005 |publisher=eMedicine from WebMD}}</ref>  

The [[Epworth Sleepiness Scale]] (ESS), designed to give an indication of sleepiness and correlated with sleep apnea,<ref name=Johns1991>{{Cite journal |author=Johns MW |title=A new method for measuring daytime sleepiness: the Epworth sleepiness scale |journal=Sleep |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |year=1991 |pmid=1798888}}</ref> or other questionnaires designed to measure [[excessive daytime sleepiness]], are diagnostic tools that can be used repeatedly to measure results of treatment.

A [[sleep diary]], also called sleep log or sleep journal, kept by a patient at home for at least two weeks, while subjective, may help determine the extent and nature of sleep disturbance and the level of alertness in the normal environment. A parallel journal kept by a parent or bed partner, if any, can also be helpful. Sleep logs also can be used for self-monitoring and in connection with behavioral and other treatment.

An [[actigraph]] unit is a motion-sensing device worn on the wrist, generally for one week. It gives a gross picture of sleep-wake cycles and is often used to verify the sleep diary. It is cost-efficient when full polysomnography is not required.

[[Polysomnography]]<ref>{{eMedicine|neuro|566|Polysomnography: Overview and Clinical Application}}</ref> is performed in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably at his or her usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), [[electrooculogram]] (EOG), [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. A single part of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with portable equipment, for example [[oximetry]], which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders.<ref name="Cataletto"/> It will usually be a definitive test for sleep apnea.

A [[Multiple Sleep Latency Test]] (MSLT) is often performed during the entire day after polysomnography while the electrodes and other equipment are still in place. The patient is given nap opportunities every second hour; the test measures the number of minutes it takes from the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep. It is a measure of daytime sleepiness; it also shows whether [[REM sleep]] is achieved in a short nap, a typical indication of [[narcolepsy]].

[[Medical imaging|Imaging studies]] may be performed if a patient is to be evaluated for neurodegenerative disease or to determine the obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea.<ref name="Cataletto"/>

When sleep complaints are secondary to pain, other medical or psychiatric diagnoses, or substance abuse, it may be necessary to treat both the underlying cause and the sleep problems.

When the underlying cause of sleep problems is not immediately obvious, behavioral treatments are usually the first suggested. These range from [[patient education]] about [[sleep hygiene]] to [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT).

[[Pharmacology]] is necessary for some conditions. Medication may be useful for acute insomnia and for some of the parasomnias. It is almost always needed, along with scheduled short naps and close follow-up, in the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.

Chronic circadian rhythm disorders, the most common of which is [[delayed sleep phase disorder]], may be managed by specifically timed bright [[light therapy]], timed oral administration of the hormone [[melatonin]], and/or [[chronotherapy]]. Stimulants may also be prescribed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565320 |title=Guidelines Issued for Management of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders |accessdate=2008-08-04 |last=Barclay |first=Laurie |coauthors=Charles Vega |date=November 5, 2007 |publisher=Medscape medical news}}</ref> When these therapies are unsuccessful, counseling may be indicated to help a person adapt to and live with the condition.

[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) machines and oral appliances are used nightly at home to manage sleep-related breathing disorders such as apnea. In some cases, upper airway surgery generally performed by an otolaryngologist/head & neck surgeon or occasionally an oral and maxillofacial [[oral and maxillofacial surgery|surgeon]] is indicated.<ref name="Cataletto"/> In mild cases in obese people, weight reduction may be sufficient. The treatments prevent airway collapse, which interrupts breathing during sleep.<ref>{{eMedicine|neuro|419|Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome}}</ref> A 2001 study published by [[Hans-Werner Gessmann]] in the Journal of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Psychology found that patients who practiced a series of electrical stimulations of specific tongue muscles for 20 minutes a day showed a marked decline in sleep apnea symptoms after three months.
