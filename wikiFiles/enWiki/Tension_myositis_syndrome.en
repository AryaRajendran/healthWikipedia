'''Tension myositis syndrome''' ('''TMS'''), also known as '''tension myoneural syndrome''', is a name given by [[John E.

==Symptoms==
Back pain is frequently mentioned as a TMS symptom,<ref name="schechter07"/><ref name="ucla">{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.ucla.edu/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=159 |title=Back Pain: An Unconventional Approach |accessdate=2007-09-12 |last=Greenberg |first=Jerome |date=2000-02-01 |work=Proceedings of UCLA Healthcare |publisher=UCLA Department of Medicine}}</ref><ref name="coen"/><ref name="rashbaum"/> but Sarno defines TMS symptoms much more broadly than that:
* ''Symptom type:'' TMS symptoms include pain, stiffness, weakness, tingling, [[numbness]] and other negative sensations, according to Sarno.
* ''Symptom location:'' In addition to the back, Sarno states that TMS symptoms can occur in the [[neck]], [[knee]] and other parts of the body.<ref name="medscape1"/>  Schechter states that the symptoms have a tendency to move to other parts of the body.  He considers symptom movement an important indicator that the pain is from TMS.<ref name="schechter07"/>

==Diagnosis==
Below is a list of criteria for diagnosing TMS, according to Schechter and Sarno:
*''Lack of known physical cause:''  Schechter and Sarno state that a [[physical examination]], tests and [[imaging studies]] is needed to rule out serious conditions, such as tumors.<ref name="schechter07"/><ref name="sarno1"/> Sarno considers [[spinal disc herniation]]s to generally be harmless, because he says the symptom location does not correlate to the herniation location.<ref name="sarno1"/>
*''Tender points:''<ref name="schechter07"/> While medical doctors use eleven of eighteen tender points as a diagnostic criteria for [[fibromyalgia]], Sarno states that he uses six main tender points to diagnose TMS:  two tender points in the upper [[trapezius muscles]], two in the [[lumbar paraspinal]] muscles and two in the lateral upper [[buttocks]]. He states that these are found in 99% of TMS patients.<ref name="sarno3"/>
*''History of other psychosomatic disorders:''  Schechter and Sarno consider a prior history of other psychosomatic disorders an indication that the patient may have TMS.  They list [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[tension headache]] as examples of psychosomatic disorders.<ref name="schechter07"/><ref name="sarno3"/>

Schechter and Sarno state that if a patient is unable to visit a medical doctor who is trained in TMS, then the patient should see a traditional medical doctor to rule out serious disorders, such as [[fractures]], [[tumors]] and [[infections]].<ref name="seattle"/><ref name="schechter05"/>

==Treatment==
===Treatment protocol===
The treatment protocol for TMS includes education, writing about emotional issues and resumption of a normal lifestyle.  For patients who do not recover quickly, the protocol also includes support groups and/or psychotherapy.<ref name="schechter07"/><ref name="rashbaum"/>

Sarno's protocol for treatment of TMS is used by the Harvard RSI Action Group, a student volunteer organization, as part of their preventative education and support program for people with [[repetitive strain injury]], also referred to as "RSI".<ref name="harvard-RSI">Harvard RSI Action Group: [http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/handout.doc handout document], and [http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/mb_what_is.html website]</ref>

;Education
Education may take the form of office visits, lectures and written and audio materials. The content of the education includes the psychological and physiological aspects of TMS.<ref name="schechter07"/><ref name="rashbaum"/> According to Schechter, the education allows the patients to "learn that their physical condition is actually benign and that any disability they have is a function of pain-related fear and deconditioning, not the actual risk of further 're-injury.'"<ref name="schechter07"/>

;Writing about emotional issues
Sarno states that each patient should set aside time daily to think and write about issues that could have led to the patient's repressed emotions.  He recommends the following two [[Writing therapy|writing tasks]]:
* ''Writing a list of issues.''  Sarno states that each patient should try to list out all issues that might contribute to the patient's repressed emotions.  He suggests looking in the following areas:  (a) certain childhood experiences, such as [[Child abuse|abuse]] or lack of love, (b) personality traits such as [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], conscientiousness and a strong need to be liked by everyone, (c) current life pressures, (d) [[aging]] and mortality and (e) situations in which the patient experiences conscious but unexpressed anger.
* ''Writing essays.'' Sarno recommends that the patient write an essay for each item on the above list.  He prefers longer essays because they force the patient to examine the emotional issues in depth.<ref name="sarno2"/>

Schechter developed a 30-day daily journal called "The MindBody Workbook" to assist the patient in recording emotionally significant events and making correlations between those events and their physical symptoms. According to Sarno and Schechter, daily repetition of the psychological process over time defeats the repression through conscious awareness.<ref>Schechter D. The MindBody Workbook. Los Angeles: MindBody Medicine Publications, 1999, ISBN 1-929997-05-1.</ref>

;Resumption of a normal lifestyle
To return to a normal lifestyle, patients are told to take the following actions:
* ''Discontinuation of physical treatments -'' Sarno advises patients to stop using [[spinal manipulation]], [[physical therapy]] and other physical treatments because "they tend to reinforce erroneously a structural causation for the chronic pain."<ref name="rashbaum"/>
* ''Resumption of normal physical activity -'' Schechter states that patients are encouraged to "gradually be more active, and begin to resume a normal life."<ref name="schechter07"/> In addition, patients are encouraged "to discontinue the safety behaviours aimed at protecting their 'damaged' backs".<ref name="schechter05"/>

;Support meetings
Sarno uses support meetings for patients who do not make a prompt recovery.  Sarno states that the support meetings (a) allow the patients to explore emotional issues that may be causing their symptoms and (b) review concepts covered during the earlier education.<ref name="rashbaum"/>

;Psychotherapy
Sarno says that about 20% of his patients need [[psychotherapy]]. He states that he uses "short-term, dynamic, analytically oriented psychotherapy."<ref name="rashbaum"/> Schechter says that he uses psychotherapy for about 30% of his patients, and that six to ten sessions are needed per patient.<ref name="schechter07"/>

===Medical evidence===
While [[psychogenic pain]] and [[pain disorder]] are accepted diagnoses in the medical community, the TMS modality is more controversial.

A non-peer-reviewed 2005 study by Schechter at the Seligman Medical Institute (SMI), co-authored with institute director Arthur Smith, found that treatment of TMS achieved a 57% success rate among patients with chronic back pain.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Schechter D, Smith AP | year=2005 | title=Long-Term Outcome of Back Pain Patients Treated by a Psychologically Based Program (Abstract #1112) |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=A–101 | url=http://www.psychosomatic.org/events/2005meetingabstracts.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2006-09-05}}</ref>

A peer-reviewed<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternative-therapies.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/Content.Main/id/45 |title=Info for Authors|work=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|accessdate=2010-01-30 |publisher=InnoVision Communications, LLC}}</ref> 2007 study with Schechter, Smith and Stanley Azen, Professor and Co-Director of [[Biostatistics]] in the Department of Preventative Medicine at the [[University of Southern California|USC]] Keck School of Medicine, found a 54% success rate for treatment of TMS (''P''<.00001).  The treatment consisted of office visits, at-home educational materials, writing about emotional issues and psychotherapy.  The average pain duration for the study's patients was 9 years.  Patients with less than 6 months of back pain were excluded to "control for the confounder that most back pain episodes typically resolve on their own in a few weeks."<ref name="schechter07"/>

Schechter, Smith and Azen also compared their results to the results of three studies of other psychological treatments for chronic back pain.  The three non-TMS studies were selected because of (a) their quality, as judged by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], and (b) the similarity of their pain measurements to those used in the TMS study.  Of the three non-TMS studies, only one (the Turner study) showed a statistically significant improvement.  Compared to the 2007 TMS study, the Turner study had a lower success rate (26%-35%, depending on the type of psychological treatment) and a lower level of statistical significance (''P''<.05).<ref name="schechter07"/>

Schechter, ''et al.''  state that one advantage of TMS treatment is that it avoids the risks associated with surgery and medication, but they caution that the risks of TMS treatment are somewhat unknown due to the relatively low number of patients studied so far.<ref name="schechter07"/>

==Theory==
According to Sarno, TMS is a condition in which unconscious emotional issues (primarily rage) initiate a process that causes physical [[pain]] and other symptoms.  His theory suggests that the unconscious mind uses the [[autonomic nervous system]] to decreases [[blood flow]] to [[muscle]]s, [[nerves]] or [[tendons]], resulting in [[oxygen deprivation]], experienced as pain in the affected tissues.<ref name="medscape1"/><ref name="rashbaum"/><ref name="ruden">{{Cite journal| author=Ruden  RA | title=Encoding States: A Model for the Origin and Treatment of Complex Psychogenic Pain | journal=Traumatology | year=2008 | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=119–126 | url=http://www.healingthemind.net/Encode3.pdf | doi=10.1177/1534765608315625 }}</ref> Sarno theorizes that because patients often report that back pain seems to move around, up and down the spine, or from side to side, that this implies the pain may not be caused by a physical deformity or injury.<ref name = "sarno3"/>

Sarno states that the underlying cause of the pain is the mind's defense mechanism against [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] mental stress and emotions such as [[anger]], [[anxiety]] and [[narcissistic rage]]. The [[conscious mind]] is distracted by the physical pain, as the [[psychological repression]] process keeps the anger/rage contained in the unconscious and thereby prevented from entering conscious [[awareness]].<ref name="coen">{{Cite journal|author=Coen SJ, Sarno JE |title=Psychosomatic avoidance of conflict in back pain |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=359–76 |year=1989 |pmid=2530198 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="enigma">{{Cite book| last = Cailliet | first = René  | title = Low Back Disorders: A Medical Enigma  | publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health  | year = 2003  | isbn = 0-7817-4448-2   | page = 14  | authorlink = Rene Cailliet }}</ref>   Sarno believes that when patients recognize that the symptoms are only a distraction, the symptoms then serve no purpose, and they go away. TMS can be considered a psychosomatic condition and  has been referred to as a "distraction pain syndrome".<ref name="schechter05">{{Cite journal| author=Schechter D, Smith AP. | title=Back pain as a distraction pain syndrome (DPS): A window to a whole new dynamic in integrative medicine | journal=Evidence Based Integrative Medicine | year=2005 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3–8 | url=http://www.smi-mindbodyresearch.org/DistractionPain.htm | doi=10.2165/01197065-200502010-00002 }}</ref>

Sarno is a vocal critic of [[conventional medicine]] with regard to diagnosis and treatment of [[back pain]], which is often treated by rest, [[physical therapy]], exercise and/or surgery.<ref name="sarno1"/>

==Notable patients==
Notable patients who have been treated for TMS include the following:
*Radio personality [[Howard Stern]] credited TMS treatment with the relief of his "excruciating back and shoulder pain",<ref name="mindbody-back-cover">{{Cite book| title = The Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain | publisher = Warner Books | year = 1998 | last = Sarno | first = John E. | authorlink = John E.

*Television writer and producer [[Janette Barber]] said that for three years, she had been increasingly unable to walk, and eventually began to use a wheelchair, due to severe ankle pain originally diagnosed as [[tendinitis]].<ref name="larryking"/>  She was later diagnosed and treated for TMS.  According to Barber, she was "pain-free one week after [Sarno's] lecture" and able to walk and run within a few months,<ref name="20-20"/><ref name="larryking"/><ref name=foodnetwork>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/hosts_celebrity_chefs/article/0,1974,FOOD_9889_1842044,00.html  |title=Janette Barber (Food Network host biography) |accessdate=2008-01-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071109002455/http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/hosts_celebrity_chefs/article/0,1974,FOOD_9889_1842044,00.html |archivedate = 9 November 2007}}</ref> notwithstanding her "occasional" relapses of pain.<ref name="larryking"/>
*The late actress [[Anne Bancroft]] said that she saw several doctors for back pain, but only Sarno's TMS treatment helped her.<ref name="NYTimes-A"/><ref name="20-20"/>

==Controversy==
The TMS diagnosis and treatment protocol are not accepted by the mainstream medical community.<ref name="NYTimes-A"/><ref name="20-20"/>  Sarno himself stated in a 2004 interview with ''[[Medscape]] Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine'' that "99.999% of the medical profession does not accept this diagnosis."<ref name="medscape1"/>  Although the vast majority of medical doctors do not accept TMS, there are prominent doctors who accept it. [[Andrew Weil]], a notable medical doctor and [[alternative medicine]] proponent, endorses TMS treatment for back pain.<ref name=weilsite>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA400205 | first = Andrew | last = Weil |title=Help for an Aching Back? |accessdate=2010-03-02}}</ref><ref name="weilbook">{{Cite book| last = Weil  | first = Andrew  | title = Spontaneous Healing: How to Discover and Enhance Your Body's Natural Ability to Maintain and Heal Itself | url=http://tmswiki.wetpaint.com/page/TMS+In+The+Media/revision/8 | publisher = Ballantine Books | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-449-91064-4 }}</ref> [[Mehmet Oz]], a television personality and Professor of Surgery at [[Columbia University]], includes TMS treatment in his four recommendations for treating back pain.<ref name=oz>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/health/Dr-Oz-Treatments-for-Low-Back-Pain| first = Mehmet| last = Oz |title=4 Treatments for Low Back Pain |date=2009-09-15 |work=Oprah.com |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref> Richard E. Sall, a medical doctor who authored a book on worker's compensation, includes TMS in a list of conditions he considers possible causes of back pain resulting in missed work days that increase the costs of worker's compensation programs.<ref name="hall">{{Cite book| last = Sall, MD  | first = Richard E.  | title = Strategies in Workers' Compensation | publisher = Hamilton Books | year = 2004  | isbn = 0-7618-2771-4   | page = 91 }}</ref>

Critics in mainstream medicine state that neither the theory of TMS nor the effectiveness of the treatment has been proven in a properly controlled [[clinical trial]],<ref name="sarno2"/> citing the [[placebo effect]] and [[regression to the mean]] as possible explanations for its success.  Patients typically see their doctor when the pain is at its worst and pain chart scores statistically improve over time even if left untreated; most people recover from an episode of back pain within weeks without any medical intervention at all.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pengel LH, Herbert RD, Maher CG, Refshauge KM |title=Acute low back pain: systematic review of its prognosis |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7410 |pages=323 |year=2003 |pmid=12907487 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7410.323 |pmc=169642}}</ref>  The TMS theory has also been criticized as too simplistic to account for the complexity of pain syndromes.<ref name="20-20"/>

Sarno responds that he has had success with many patients who have exhausted every other means of treatment, which he says is proof that regression to the mean is not the cause.<ref name="20-20"/>
