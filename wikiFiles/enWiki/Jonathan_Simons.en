'''Jonathan W. Simons, MD''' (born November 18, 1958) is an internationally recognized physician-scientist, medical [[Oncology|oncologist]], and internationally recognized leader in prostate cancer research. Simons is currently the President, Chief Executive Officer, and David H. Koch Chair of the [[Prostate Cancer Foundation]]. Simons’ laboratories at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Emory University]] made original contributions to prostate cancer immunotherapy after inventing GM-CSF genetically engineered vaccines for prostate cancer. Young physician-scientists in the Simons’ laboratories made original discoveries on the roles of interleukin-6, endothelin-1, and HIF-1alpha genes in human prostate cancer bone metastasis.

==Biography==

Simons was raised in [[Ithaca, New York]]. He is the husband, son, and grandson of [[cancer survivors]]. Simons’ father, David M. Simons, a professor at [[Cornell University]], was among the first thousand patients cured of relapsed [[Hodgkin’s Lymphoma]] as a part of participation in National Cancer Institute clinical trials that were personally witnessed by Simons while in high school. Simons is the grandson of M.L. Wilson, who served as the Under Secretary of Agriculture under President Franklin Roosevelt. Simons graduated magna cum laude from [[Princeton University]] in with an A. B. in [[biochemistry]] in 1980. Before entering medical school, Simons studied as a [[Rotary International]] Postgraduate Fellow in the Humanities at the [[University of Kent]] in [[Canterbury]], England, and a Nuffield Foundation Fellow in the Department of Biochemistry at the [[University of Cambridge]]. 

Simons received an MD degree from the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1985. Simons completed his residency in internal medicine at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and a clinical fellowship in medical oncology at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. Simons was board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology. At Johns Hopkins and supported by a 5 year National Institutes of Health Physician-Scientist K-Award, Simons completed a full post-doctoral fellowship under [[Bert Vogelstein]] in human cancer molecular genetics prior to being appointed to the Hopkins medical school faculty in oncology and urology in 1991. On the Hopkins faculty, Simons chaired the medical school Curriculum Committee for Oncology. Prior to receiving funding from the NCI and the Department of Defense for prostate cancer research, Simons' first independent laboratory research grant was from the [[Prostate Cancer Foundation]] (formerly known as CaPCure) in the foundation’s first year of existence in 1993.

At 41 years old, Simons was recruited by the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] governor [[Roy Barnes]] and the [[Robert W. Woodruff]]  Foundation of Atlanta to be the Founding Director of the Winship Cancer Institute at [[Emory University]]. Simons led the creation of the Georgia State Cancer Plan, Georgia’s tobacco settlement investment in [[cancer research]] and new faculty recruitment programs within the Georgia Cancer Coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiacancer.org |title=Georgia Cancer Coalition|accessdate=2011-04-13}}</ref>  In addition to leading 41 faculty recruitments, and leading the design and construction of a new dedicated $90 million cancer institute building for the NCI Designated Cancer Center, Simons co-directed with Shuming Nie the [[National Cancer Institute]] Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence at Emory and Georgia Institute of Technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcigtccne.org|title=WCGTCCNE|accessdate=2011-04.13}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> From 2000 to 2006 , Simons was a Distinguished Service Professor of Hematology and Oncology at the [[Emory University School of Medicine]], and Professor of Materials Sciences Engineering at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].

With [[Michael Milken]], Chairman of the Board of FasterCures, Simons created the strategic plan and served as the interim chief science officer for the launch of the Melanoma Research Alliance. The Melanoma Research Alliance was founded by Debra and Leon Black in 2007; it is now the world’s leading funder of biomedical research in melanoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melanomaresearchalliance.org |title=  Melanoma Research Alliance |accessdate=2011-04-13}}</ref> 

Simons currently serves on the Board of Directors of FasterCures as well as Melanoma Research Alliance. Simons also serves on multiple Scientific Advisory Boards including that of the V Foundation and the EP Evans Foundation. 
Simons is married and has two sons.

==Prostate Cancer Foundation under Simons ==

Ever since Simons became the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, the foundation has generated a total of $189.3 million in revenue, of which over 70% is used to fund research grants and science programs support. 

Under Simons’ leadership, the Prostate Cancer Foundation has expanded its global research and partnership. In 2008, 2011, and 2012 respectively, the foundation launched its researching funding program in the United Kingdom, People’s Republic of China, and Ireland. During Simons’ term, the Prostate Cancer Foundation also increased its support for cancer researchers in Australia as well as Greece with the PCF Hellenic Fund. Simons and his team also oversaw the creation of the Coalition to Cure Prostate Cancer (CCPC), an independent non-profit organization in Canada, in 2011. As of today, CCPC has committed to fund four young prostate cancer researchers in Canada for $225,000 per scientist. 

When Simons joined the Prostate Cancer Foundation in 2007, he launched the PCF 100, which has secured support commitment for 100 Young Investigators. Each Young Investigator receives a total grant amount of $225,000, which is matched dollar-for-dollar by his or her university
