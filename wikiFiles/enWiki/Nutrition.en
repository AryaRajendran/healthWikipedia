'''Nutrition''' (also called '''nourishment''' or '''aliment''') is the provision, to [[Cells (biology)|cells]] and [[organism]]s, of the materials necessary (in the form of food) to support [[life]]. Many common health problems can be prevented or alleviated with a [[healthy diet]].

The [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of an organism is what it eats,   which is largely determined by the perceived [[palatability]] of foods. [[Dietitian]]s are [[health professional]]s who specialize in [[human nutrition]], meal planning, economics, and preparation. They are trained to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice and management to individuals (in health and disease), as well as to institutions.  Clinical [[nutritionist]]s are health professionals who focus more specifically on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs. While government regulation of the use of this professional title is less universal than for "dietician", the field is supported by many high-level academic programs, up to and including the Doctoral level, and has its own voluntary certification board,<ref>[http://www.cncb.org/ Clinical Nutrition Certification Board].

===Overview===
Nutritional science investigates the [[metabolism|metabolic]] and physiological responses of the body to diet. With advances in the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[nutritional immunology]], [[molecular medicine]] and [[genetics]], the study of nutrition is increasingly concerned
with metabolism and [[metabolic pathway]]s: the sequences of biochemical steps through which substances in living things change from one form to another.

[[Carnivore]] and [[herbivore]] diets are contrasting, with basic [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] proportions being at varying levels in particular foods. Carnivores consume more nitrogen than carbon{{fact|date=March 2013}} while herbivores consume less nitrogen than carbon, when an equal quantity{{which|date=March 2013}} is measured.

The [[human body]] contains [[chemical compound]]s, such as [[water]], [[carbohydrate]]s (sugar, starch, and fiber), [[amino acid]]s (in [[protein]]s), [[fatty acid]]s (in [[lipid]]s), and [[nucleic acid]]s ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]). These compounds in turn consist of [[chemical element|elements]] such as [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[magnesium]], [[manganese]], and so on. All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations (e.g. [[hormone]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, [[hydroxyapatite]]), both in the [[human body]] and in the plant and animal organisms that humans eat.

The human body consists of elements and compounds ingested, digested, absorbed, and circulated through the [[blood]]stream to feed the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of the body. Except in the unborn fetus, the [[digestive system]] is the first system involved {{Vague|date=August 2009}}. In a typical adult, about seven liters of digestive juices enter the digestive tract.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}{{Clarify|date=January 2009}} These digestive juices break [[chemical bond]]s in ingested molecules, and modify their [[Protein conformation|conformations]] and energy states. Though some molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged, digestive processes release them from the matrix of foods. Unabsorbed matter, along with some waste products of [[metabolism]], is eliminated from the body in the [[feces]].

Studies of nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the [[chemical]] composition of the whole diet and of all material [[excreted]] and eliminated from the body (in [[urine]] and feces). Comparing the food to the waste can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized in the body. The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period, during which all food and waste must be analyzed. The number of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] involved in such [[experiment]]s is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving.

In general, eating a wide variety of fresh, whole (unprocessed), foods has proven favorable for one's health compared to monotonous diets based on processed foods.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100611062731/http://thehealthylifestyleconsultant.com/MakingtheTransitiontoWholeFoods.aspx Making the Transition to Whole Foods]. thehealthylifestyleconsultant.com</ref>
In particular, the consumption of whole-plant foods slows digestion and allows better absorption, and a more favorable balance of essential nutrients per [[Calorie]], resulting in better management of cell growth, maintenance, and [[mitosis]] (cell division), as well as better regulation of appetite and blood sugar {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Regularly scheduled meals (every few hours) have also proven more wholesome than infrequent or haphazard ones,<ref>[http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2008/080215.htm Researchers Look at How Frequency of Meals May Affect Health]. USDA Agricultural Research Service. Ars.usda.gov (February 15, 2008). Retrieved on 2011-10-17.</ref> although a recent study has also linked more frequent meals with a higher risk of colon cancer in men.<ref>[http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/more_meals_ups_colon_cancer.shtml More Meals Per Day May Up Men's Colon Cancer Risk].

===Nutrients===
{{Main|Nutrient}}

There are six major classes of nutrients: [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[protein]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]].

These nutrient classes can be categorized as either [[macronutrient]]s (needed in relatively large amounts) or [[micronutrient]]s (needed in smaller quantities). The macronutrients include carbohydrates (including [[Dietary fiber|fiber]]), fats, protein, and water. The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.

The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital ''C'' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&nbsp;kJ approximately (4&nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&nbsp;kJ (9&nbsp;kcal) per gram.,<ref name=Stryer>{{cite book | author = Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7167-4684-0 |page= 603 }}</ref> though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material, fiber (i.e., non-digestible material such as cellulose), is also required, {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, although the exact reasons remain unclear.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharide]]s (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharide]]s (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomer]]s bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[Essential fatty acid|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acid]]s, some of which are [[Essential amino acid|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation.

Other micronutrients include [[antioxidant]]s and [[phytochemical]]s, which are said to influence (or protect) some body systems. Their necessity is not as well established as in the case of, for instance, vitamins.

Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes, together with other substances, such as toxins of various sorts. Some nutrients can be stored internally (e.g., the fat soluble vitamins), while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or, in extreme cases, too much of a required nutrient. For example, both salt and water (both absolutely required) will cause illness or even death in excessive amounts.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-drinking-too-much-water-can-kill | title = Strange but True: Drinking Too Much Water Can Kill | publisher = ''[[Scientific American]]'' | date = June 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Can shipwrecked men survive if they drink sea water? | url = http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/picks-from-the-past/181950/thirst?page=3 | publisher = Natural History Magazine}}</ref>

====Carbohydrates====
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}
Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products.
Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides contain one, two, and three or more sugar units, respectively. Polysaccharides are often referred to as ''complex'' carbohydrates because they are typically long, multiple branched chains of sugar units.

Traditionally, simple carbohydrates were believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates. This, however, is not accurate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Otto|first=H|title=Diabetik Bei Diabetus Mellitus|year=1973|publisher=Verlag Hans Huber|location=Bern}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P|coauthors=Reaven, Olefsky|journal=Diabetes|year=1977|volume=26|pages=1178–1183|doi=10.2337/diabetes.26.12.1178|pmid=590639|title=Postprandial plasma-glucose and -insulin responses to different complex carbohydrates|issue=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P|coauthors=Kolterman, Waldeck, Reaven, Olefsky|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=1980|volume=33|pages=1723–1728|pmid=6996472|title=Postprandial hormonal responses to different types of complex carbohydrate in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance|issue=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=David|coauthors=Jenkins, Alexandra L.; Wolever, Thomas M.S.; Thompson, Lilian H.  and Rao, A.

Glucose stimulates the production of insulin through food entering the bloodstream, which is grasped by the beta cells in the pancreas.

=====Fiber=====
{{Main|Dietary fiber}}

Dietary fiber is a [[carbohydrate]] (or a polysaccharide) that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of [[cellulose]], a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible because humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|fig]]s), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]] by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in [[whole wheat flour]], nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates [[peristalsis]] – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel which slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of [[type 2 diabetes]]. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033 |title=Dietary fiber: Essential for a healthy diet |publisher=MayoClinic.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

====Fat====
{{Main|Fat}}

A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fat]]s are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].  There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as [[conjugated linoleic acid]], catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and [[punicic acid]], in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.

Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

=====Essential fatty acids=====
{{Main|Essential fatty acids}}

Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—[[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoid]]s known as [[prostaglandin]]s, which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. weakly [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.

The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme [[desaturase|delta-5-desaturase]], which in turn is controlled by hormones such as [[insulin]] (up-regulation) and [[glucagon]] (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and [[inflammation]], and [[mitosis]] (i.e. cell division).

====Protein====
[[Image:LemonChicken2.jpg|thumb|right|Most [[meat]]s such as [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] contain all the [[essential amino acid]]s needed for humans.]]

{{Main|Protein in nutrition}}

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of [[amino acid]]s, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A ''complete'' protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an ''incomplete'' protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.

It is possible to combine two incomplete protein sources (e.g. rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein don't need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body.<ref>{{cite journal|author=American Dietetic Association|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets|journal= JADA|year= 2003|volume= 103|issue=6|pages= 748–765|pmid=12778049}}</ref> Sources of dietary protein include [[meat]]s, [[tofu]] and other [[soy]]-products, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[legume]]s, and [[dairy product]]s such as [[milk]] and [[cheese]]. Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. The amino acids remaining after such conversion are discarded.

====Minerals====
{{Main|Dietary mineral|Composition of the human body}}

Dietary minerals are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned, including several [[metal]]s, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].

=====Macrominerals=====

Many elements are essential in relative quantity; they are usually  called "bulk minerals". Some are structural, but many play a role as [[electrolyte]]s.<ref>{{cite book | author=Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition=3rd | publisher=Worth Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 |  isbn=1-57259-153-6}}</ref> Elements with recommended dietary allowance ([[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]]) greater than 200&nbsp;mg/day are, in alphabetical order (with informal or folk-medicine perspectives in parentheses):
* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally (for muscle and digestive system health, bone strength, some forms neutralize acidity, may help clear toxins, provides signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte; see sodium, below
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity)
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing<ref>{{cite book | author= Corbridge, D. E. C. | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=0-444-89307-5}}</ref>
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health)
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte; not generally found in dietary supplements, despite being needed in large quantities, because the ion is very common in food: typically as [[sodium chloride]], or common salt.  Excessive sodium consumption can deplete [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]], {{Verify source|date=May 2010}} leading to high blood pressure and osteoporosis.
* [[Sulfur]], for three essential amino acids and therefore many proteins (skin, hair, nails, liver, and pancreas).  Sulfur is not consumed alone, but in the form of sulfur-containing amino acids

=====Trace minerals=====

Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzyme]]s.<ref name=lipp>{{cite book | author=Lippard, S. J. and Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994|isbn=0935702725}}</ref> Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 200&nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:

* [[Cobalt]] required for biosynthesis of [[vitamin B12]] family of [[coenzyme]]s.  Animals cannot biosynthesize B12, and must obtain this cobalt-containing vitamin in the diet
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]] {{main|Copper in health}}
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxine]], but probably, for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see Extrathyroidal [[iodine]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes, and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Nickel]] present in [[urease]]
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Vanadium]] (Speculative: there is no established RDA for vanadium. No specific biochemical function has been identified for it in humans, although vanadium is required for some lower organisms.)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], and [[carbonic anhydrase]]

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}

As with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is the exception: it can be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of [[UVB radiation]].) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as [[carnitine]], are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not "essential" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different [[phytochemical]]s have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including [[antioxidant]] activity (see below); however, experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients that are not classified as vitamins include [[essential amino acid]]s (see [[#Protein|above]]), [[choline]], [[essential fatty acid]]s (see [[#Essential fatty acids|above]]), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.

Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions, including [[goitre]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired [[immune system]], disorders of cell [[metabolism]], certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature [[aging]], and poor [[psychology|psychological health]] (including [[eating disorder]]s), among many others.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Shils, M. S. ''et al.'' | year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=0-7817-4133-5}}</ref> Excess levels of some vitamins are also dangerous to health (notably [[vitamin A]]), and for at least one vitamin, B6, toxicity begins at levels not far above the required amount.
Deficient or excess levels of minerals can also have serious health consequences.

====Water====
{{Main|Drinking water}}
[[Image:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|left|A manual [[water]] [[pump]] in [[China]]]]
Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including [[urine]] and [[feces]], [[sweating]], and by [[water vapour]] in the exhaled breath. Therefore it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.

Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health  suggested that 6–8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |title=Healthy Water Living|publisher=BBC.

====Other nutrients====

Other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals. These substances are generally more recent discoveries that have not yet been recognized as vitamins or as required. Phytochemicals may act as antioxidants, but not all phytochemicals are antioxidants.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=====Antioxidants=====
{{Main|Antioxidant}}

[[File:Colorfull.jpg|thumb|Colorful [[fruit]]s are important components of a healthy diet.]]
As cellular [[metabolism]]/energy production requires oxygen, potentially damaging (e.g. [[mutation]] causing) compounds known as [[free radical]]s can form. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e. acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For the continued normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of [[evolution of dietary antioxidants]]. Some are produced by the human body with adequate [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] ([[glutathione]], [[Vitamin C]]), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, [[Vitamin A]], [[Vitamin K]]) or produced by the body from other compounds ([[Beta-carotene]] converted to Vitamin A by the body, [[Vitamin D]] synthesized from [[cholesterol]] by [[sunlight]]). Phytochemicals (''Section Below'') and their subgroup, polyphenols, make up the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known. Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network. For example, Vitamin C can reactivate free radical-containing [[glutathione]] or Vitamin E by accepting the free radical itself. Some antioxidants are more effective than others at neutralizing different free radicals. Some cannot neutralize certain free radicals. Some cannot be present in certain areas of free radical development (Vitamin A is [[fat-soluble]] and protects fat areas, Vitamin C is [[water]] soluble and protects those areas). When interacting with a free radical, some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound that is less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound. Having a variety of antioxidants allows any byproducts to be safely dealt with by more efficient antioxidants in neutralizing a free radical's [[butterfly effect]].

Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health, later large [[clinical trial]]s did not detect any benefit and suggested instead that excess supplementation may be harmful.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2300578/ |title=The Doctor and the Pomegranate|publisher=Slate.

=====Phytochemicals=====
[[Image:Blackberry fruits10.jpg|thumb|right||[[Blackberry|Blackberries]] are a source of [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s]]

{{Main|Phytochemical}}

A growing area of interest is the effect upon human health of trace chemicals, collectively called [[phytochemical]]s.  These nutrients are typically found in edible plants, especially colorful fruits and vegetables, but also other organisms including seafood, algae, and fungi. The effects of phytochemicals increasingly survive rigorous testing by prominent health organizations.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  One of the principal classes of phytochemicals are [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s, chemicals that are known to provide certain health benefits to the [[cardiovascular system]] and [[immune system]].  These chemicals are known to down-regulate the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]], key chemicals in [[cardiovascular disease]].

Perhaps the most rigorously tested phytochemical is [[zeaxanthin]], a yellow-pigmented carotenoid present in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. Repeated studies have shown a strong correlation between ingestion of zeaxanthin and the prevention and treatment of [[age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seddon JM, Ajani UA, Sperduto RD, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary carotenoids, vitamins A, C, and E, and advanced age-related macular degeneration. Eye Disease Case-Control Study Group |journal=JAMA |volume=272 |issue=18 |pages=1413–20 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7933422 |doi=10.1001/jama.272.18.1413 }} See http://www.mdsupport.org/library/zeaxanthin.html.</ref> {{Better source|date=May 2010}} Less rigorous studies have proposed a correlation between zeaxanthin intake and [[cataract]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lyle BJ, Mares-Perlman JA, Klein BE, Klein R, Greger JL |title=Antioxidant intake and risk of incident age-related nuclear cataracts in the Beaver Dam Eye Study |journal=Am.

J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=517–24 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10500021 }}</ref> {{Better source|date=May 2010}} A second carotenoid, lutein, has also been shown to lower the risk of contracting AMD. Both compounds have been observed to collect in the retina when ingested orally, and they serve to protect the rods and cones against the destructive effects of light.

Another carotenoid, beta-[[cryptoxanthin]], appears to protect against chronic joint inflammatory diseases, such as [[arthritis]]. While the association between serum blood levels of beta-cryptoxanthin and substantially decreased joint disease has been established,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pattison DJ, Symmons DP, Lunt M, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary beta-cryptoxanthin and inflammatory polyarthritis: results from a population-based prospective study |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=451–5 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16087992 }}</ref> neither a convincing mechanism for such protection nor a cause-and-effect have been rigorously studied. Similarly, a red phytochemical, [[lycopene]], has substantial credible evidence of negative association with development of prostate cancer.

As indicated above, some of the correlations between the ingestion of certain phytochemicals and the prevention of disease are, in some cases, enormous in magnitude. Yet, even when the evidence is obtained, translating it to practical dietary advice can be difficult and counter-intuitive. Lutein, for example, occurs in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and protects the eyes against various diseases. However, it does not protect the eye nearly as well as zeaxanthin, and the presence of lutein in the retina will prevent zeaxanthin uptake. Additionally, evidence has shown that the lutein present in egg yolk is more readily absorbed than the lutein from vegetable sources, possibly because of fat solubility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Handelman GJ, Nightingale ZD, Lichtenstein AH, Schaefer EJ, Blumberg JB |title=Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations in plasma after dietary supplementation with egg yolk |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=247–51 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10426702 }}</ref> At the most basic level, the question "should you eat eggs?" is complex to the point of dismay, including misperceptions about the health effects of cholesterol in egg yolk, and its saturated fat content.

As another example, lycopene is prevalent in tomatoes (and actually is the chemical that gives tomatoes their red color). It is more highly concentrated, however, in processed tomato products such as commercial pasta sauce, or [[tomato soup]], than in fresh "healthy" tomatoes. Yet, such sauces tend to have high amounts of salt, sugar, other substances a person may wish or even need to avoid.

<!-- ash is not a nutrient:
====Ash====

Though not really a nutrient as such, an entry for ''ash'' is sometimes found on nutrition labels, especially for [[pet food]].  This entry measures the weight of inorganic material left over after the food is burned for two hours at 600&nbsp;°C.  Thus, it does not include water, fibre, and nutrients that provide calories, but it does include some nutrients, such as minerals <ref>Purina; [http://www.purinaone.com/CoolTools/Nutrition101.aspx?ArticleId=CE5F9A76-C480-496F-A0B1-9BDAA4675A4F The Facts About Dietary Ash]; last checked 2009-07-22</ref>

There have been some concerns that too much ash may contribute to [[feline urological syndrome]] in [[domestic cat]]s.<ref>R. Glenn Brown; [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1680954 Low ash cat foods: The role of magnesium in feline nutrition]; Canadian Veterinary Journal 1989 January 30(1): 73–79; last checked 2009-07-22</ref>

==== Intestinal bacterial flora ====
{{Main|Gut flora}}
It is now also known that animal [[intestine]]s contain a large population of [[gut flora]]. In humans, these include species such as ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[L. acidophilus]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', among many others. They are essential to [[digestion]], and are also affected by the food we eat.  Bacteria in the gut perform many important functions for humans, including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of otherwise indigestible food; stimulating cell growth; repressing the growth of harmful bacteria, training the immune system to respond only to pathogens; producing [[vitamin B12]], and defending against some infectious diseases{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

=== Advice and guidance ===

==== U.S. Government policies ====

[[Image:MyPyramid1.png|left|thumb|The updated [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[MyPyramid|food pyramid]], published in 2005, is a general nutrition guide for recommended [[food]] consumption for [[human]]s.]]

In the US, [[dietitian]]s are registered (RD) or licensed (LD) with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association, and are only able to use the title "dietitian," as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state, when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination, respectively. In California, registered dietitians must abide by the {{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=02001-03000&file=2585-2586.8|title=Business and Professions Code of Section 2585-2586.8}}Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist, including unqualified dietitians, as this term is unregulated. Some states, such as the State of Florida, have begun to include the title "nutritionist" in state licensure requirements. Most governments provide guidance on nutrition, and some also impose [[mandatory labeling|mandatory disclosure/labeling]] requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance.

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of myPlate, which superseded [[MyPyramid|food pyramid]], which superseded the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]] as seen here.

The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf Sample Menus for a 2000 Calorie Food Pattern]. mypyramid.gov</ref>  [[Canada's Food Guide]] is another governmental recommendation.

====Government programs====
Federal and state governmental organizations have been working on nutrition literacy interventions in non-primary health care settings to address the nutrition information problem in the U.S. Some programs include:

The Family Nutrition Program (FNP) is a free nutrition education program serving low-income adults around the U.S. This program is funded by the Food Nutrition Service’s (FNS) branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) usually through a local state academic institution which runs the program.  The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form healthful eating habits including nutrition education.

[http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/food/efnep/efnep.html Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program] (ENFEP) is a unique program that currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It is designed to assist limited-resource audiences in acquiring the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets, and to contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total family diet and nutritional well-being.

An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is [http://www.smartbodies.org/smart-bodies Smart Bodies], a public-private partnership between the state’s largest university system and largest health insurer, Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation.  Launched in 2005, this program promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles for children and their families.  It is an interactive educational program designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise.

====Teaching====
Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]] the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthful food choices and how to live a healthy life.

A 1985 US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.<ref>Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&page=4  p. 4]. National Academies Press.</ref> Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=941S–4S |year=2006 |pmid=16600952 |pmc=2430660 }}</ref>

===Healthy diets===
{{Main|Healthy diet}}

====Whole plant food diet====
Heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes are commonly called "Western" diseases because these maladies were once rarely seen in developing countries. [[The China Study|An international study in China]] found some regions had essentially no cancer or heart disease, while in other areas they reflected "up to a 100-fold increase" coincident with shifts from diets that were found to be entirely plant-based to heavily animal-based, respectively.<ref name = "Campbell-China">{{cite book | author=Campbell T., Campbell T. | title=The China Study | location=Dallas | publisher=Benella Books | year=2005|isbn= 1-932100-38-5}}</ref> In contrast, diseases of affluence like cancer and heart disease are common throughout the developed world, including the United States. Adjusted for age and exercise, large regional clusters of people in China rarely suffered from these "Western" diseases possibly because their diets are rich in vegetables, fruits and whole grains, and have little dairy and meat products.<ref name = "Campbell-China"/> Some studies show these to be, in high quantities, possible causes of some cancers. There are [[Veganism#Health arguments|arguments]] for and against this controversial issue.

The United Healthcare/Pacificare nutrition guideline recommends a whole plant food diet, and recommends using protein only as a condiment with meals. A ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' cover article from November 2005, entitled ''The Secrets of Living Longer'', also recommends a whole plant food diet. The article is a lifestyle survey of three populations, [[Sardinia]]ns, [[Okinawa]]ns, and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventist]]s, who generally display longevity and "suffer a fraction of the diseases that commonly kill people in other parts of the developed world, and enjoy more healthy years of life." In sum, they offer three sets of 'best practices' to emulate. The rest is up to you. In common with all three groups is to "Eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."

The ''National Geographic'' article noted that an [[NIH]] funded study of 34,000 [[Seventh-Day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s between 1976 and 1988 "...found that the Adventists' habit of consuming beans, soy milk, tomatoes, and other fruits lowered their risk of developing certain cancers. It also suggested that eating whole grain bread, drinking five glasses of water a day, and, most surprisingly, consuming four servings of nuts a week reduced their risk of heart disease."

====The French "paradox"====
{{Main|French paradox}}
The French paradox is the observation that the French suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease, despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats. A number of explanations have been suggested:

* Saturated fat consumption does not cause heart disease<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/169/7/659 | title = A Systematic Review of the Evidence Supporting a Causal Link Between Dietary Factors and Coronary Heart Disease | author = Andrew Mente; Lawrence de Koning; Harry S.

* Reduced consumption of processed carbohydrate and other junk foods. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* Regular consumption of [[red wine]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* More active lifestyles involving plenty of daily exercise, especially walking; the French are much less dependent on cars than Americans are. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* Higher consumption of artificially produced trans-fats by Americans, which has been shown to have greater [[lipoprotein]] effects per gram than saturated fat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckel RH, Borra S, Lichtenstein AH, Yin-Piazza SY |title=Understanding the complexity of trans fatty acid reduction in the American diet: American Heart Association Trans Fat Conference 2006: report of the Trans Fat Conference Planning Group |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=16 |pages=2231–46 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17426064 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.181947 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/115/16/2231}}</ref>

However, statistics collected by the [[World Health Organization]] from 1990–2000 show that the incidence of heart disease in France may have been underestimated and, in fact, may be similar to that of neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ducimetière P, Lang T, Amouyel P, Arveiler D, Ferrières J |title=Why mortality from heart disease is low in France. Rates of coronary events are similar in France and Southern Europe |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7229 |pages=249–50 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10642245 |pmc=1117444 |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7229.249/a |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/320/7229/249/a |doi_brokendate=2010-03-17}}</ref>

===Sports nutrition===

{{Main|Sports nutrition}}

====Protein====
[[Image:Protein shake.jpg|thumb|right|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]

Protein is an important component of every cell in the body. Hair and nails are mostly made of protein. The body uses protein to build and repair tissues. In addition, protein is used to make hormones and other chemicals in the body. Protein is also an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.

The protein requirement for each individual differs, as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein. The 2005 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA), aimed at the general healthy adult population, provide for an intake of 0.8 – 1&nbsp;grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (according to the BMI formula), with the review panel stating that "no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise".<ref>{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A.

====Water and salts====
Water is one of the most important nutrients in the sports diet. It helps eliminate food waste products in the body, regulates body temperature during activity and helps with digestion. Maintaining hydration during periods of physical exertion is key to peak performance. While drinking too much water during activities can lead to physical discomfort, dehydration in excess of 2% of body mass (by weight) markedly hinders athletic performance.<ref>[http://www.winforum.org/GamePlan-bw.pdf Wnforum Sports Nutrition Game Plan]. (PDF). page 19. winforum.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-17.</ref> Additional carbohydrates and protein before, during, and after exercise increase time to exhaustion as well as speed recovery. The amount of water needed is based on work performed, lean body mass, and environmental factors, especially ambient temperature and humidity. Maintaining the right amount is key. {{Vague|date=May 2010}}

====Carbohydrates====
The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates, which are stored in muscle as glycogen—a form of sugar. During exercise, muscle glycogen reserves can be used up, especially when activities last longer than 90&nbsp;min.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Because the amount of glycogen stored in the body is limited, it is important for athletes to replace glycogen by consuming a diet high in carbohydrates. Meeting energy needs can help improve performance during the sport, as well as improve overall strength and endurance.

===Nutrition literacy===
At the time of this entry, we were not able to identify any specific nutrition literacy studies in the U.S. at a national level. However, the findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL introduced the first ever measure of “the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions,” – an objective of Healthy People 2010 <ref>Baldi, S. (ED.) et al. (2009). Technical Report and Data File User’s Manual for the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NCES 2009–47). U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref> and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy, 44% have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic health literacy. The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy then those above it.

Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills.<ref name="cdc.gov">{{cite journal|author=Zoellner, J., Connell, C., Bounds, W., Crook, L., Yadrick, K. |year=2009|title= Nutrition Literacy Status and Preferred Nutrition Communications Channels Among Adults in the Lower Mississippi Delta|journal= Preventing Chronic Disease|volume= 6|issue=4|pages=A128|url=http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2009/oct/08_0016.htm }}</ref> While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological differences, Zoellner et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the U.S. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the USDA. The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment<ref name="cdc.gov"/> further delineating priorities for the region.

These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, the lack of understanding nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.

The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely documented<ref>Berkman N. D., Sheridan, S.L., Donahue, K. E., Halpern, D.J., Viera, A., Crotty, K., … Viswanathan, M. (2011). Health and Literacy Intervention Outcomes: an Updated Systematic Review. Evidence Report/Technology Assessment no. 199. Prepared by RTI International – University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center. Publication Number 11-E006. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.</ref> and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting. More must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific interventions in non-primary care settings<ref name="cdc.gov"/> in order to achieve better health outcomes.

===Malnutrition===
{{Main|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients by an organism. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption.

Although there are more organisms in the world who are malnourished due to insufficient consumption, increasingly more organisms suffer from excessive over-nutrition; a problem caused by an over abundance of sustenance coupled with the instinctual desire (by animals in particular) to consume all that it can.

[[Nutritionism]] is the view that excessive reliance on food science and the study of nutrition can, paradoxically, lead to poor nutrition and to ill health. It  was originally credited to [[Gyorgy Scrinis]],<ref>{{cite web
 | url = http://www.gyorgyscrinis.com
 | title = Gyorgy Scrinis' Web Page
 | accessdate = 2009-01-14
}}</ref> and was popularized by [[Michael Pollan]].  Since nutrients are invisible, policy makers rely on nutrition experts to advise on food choices. Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body, Pollan argues, nutritionism can be blamed for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today.<ref name="unhappy">{{cite news

====Insufficient====
Under consumption generally refers to the long-term consumption of insufficient sustenance in relation to the [[energy]] that an organism expends or expels, leading to poor health.

====Excessive====
Over consumption generally refers to the long-term consumption of excess sustenance in relation to the energy that an organism expends or expels, leading to poor health and, in animals, [[obesity]]. It can cause excessive hair loss, brittle nails, and irregular premenstrual cycles for females.

====Unbalanced====
When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper amount of other nutrients, the diet is said to be unbalanced.

====Mental agility====
{{Main|Nootropic}}

Research indicates that improving the awareness of nutritious meal choices and establishing long-term habits of healthful eating have a positive effect on cognitive and spatial memory capacity, potentially increasing a student's potential to process and retain academic information.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed foodservice contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university level institutions.  Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The impact of health and nutrition on education | author=Jere R.

There is limited research available that directly links a student's Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) to their overall nutritional health.  Additional substantive data is needed to prove that overall intellectual health is closely linked to a person's diet, rather than just another [[correlation fallacy]].

====Mental disorders====
Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], the four most common mental disorders in developed countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Lakhan SE, Vieira KF |title= Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |journal= Nutr J |volume=7 |page=2 |year=2008 |pmid=18208598 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/2 |pmc= 2248201 |issue=1}}</ref> Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (each of which are an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] contained in [[fish oil]], but not in [[flaxseed oil]]), [[vitamin B12]], [[folic acid]], and [[inositol]].

====Cancer====
Cancer is now common in developing countries. According to a study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], "In the developing world, cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food, and parasitic infections that attack organs." Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco. Developed countries "tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle'&nbsp;— cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and prostate&nbsp;— that can be caused by obesity, lack of exercise, diet and age."<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Coren| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/03/09/cancer.study/index.html | title=Study: Cancer no longer rare in poorer countries | publisher= CNN | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

====Metabolic syndrome====

Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle-induced [[hyperinsulinemia]] and reduced insulin function (i.e. [[insulin resistance]]) as a decisive factor in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and [[clot]] formation (i.e. heart disease) and exaggerated cell division (i.e. cancer). Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called [[metabolic syndrome]]) are characterized by a combination of abdominal [[obesity]], elevated [[blood sugar]], elevated [[blood pressure]], elevated blood [[triglyceride]]s, and reduced HDL [[cholesterol]]. The negative impact of hyperinsulinemia on prostaglandin PGE1/PGE2 balance may be significant.

The state of [[obesity]] clearly contributes to insulin resistance, which in turn can cause [[type 2 diabetes]]. Virtually all obese and most type 2 diabetic individuals have marked insulin resistance. Although the association between overweight and insulin resistance is clear, the exact (likely multifarious) causes of insulin resistance remain less clear. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that appropriate exercise, more regular food intake and reducing [[glycemic load]] (see below) all can reverse insulin resistance in overweight individuals (and thereby lower blood sugar levels in those who have type 2 diabetes).

Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone [[leptin]], and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced leptin signalling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate.

There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors— such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals—contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. In any case, analogous to the way modern man-made pollution may potentially overwhelm the environment's ability to maintain [[homeostasis]], the recent explosive introduction of high [[glycemic index]] and processed foods into the human diet may potentially overwhelm the body's ability to maintain homeostasis and health (as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic).

====Hyponatremia====

Excess water intake, without replenishment of sodium and potassium salts, leads to [[hyponatremia]], which can further lead to [[water intoxication]] at more dangerous levels.  A well-publicized case occurred in 2007, when [[KDND|Jennifer Strange]] died while participating in a water-drinking contest.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6263029.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Why is too much water dangerous? | accessdate=2008-11-09 | date=2007-01-15}}</ref> More usually, the condition occurs in long-distance endurance events (such as [[marathon]] or [[triathlon]] competition and training) and causes gradual mental dulling, headache, drowsiness, weakness, and confusion; extreme cases may result in coma, convulsions, and death.  The primary damage comes from swelling of the brain, caused by increased osmosis as blood salinity decreases.
Effective fluid replacement techniques include water aid stations during running/cycling races, trainers providing water during team games, such as soccer, and devices such as Camel Baks, which can provide water for a person without making it too hard to drink the water.

====Antinutrient====
{{Main|Antinutrient}}

Antinutrients are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere with the absorption of nutrients. Nutrition studies focus on antinutrients commonly found in food sources and beverages.

====Processed foods====

{{Main|Food processing}}

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many [[technology|technologies]] that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include [[pasteurisation]], [[autoclavation]], [[drying]], [[salting (food)|salting]], and separation of various components, all of which appear to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies undoubtedly have downfalls as well.

Modern separation techniques such as [[Gristmill|milling]], [[centrifugation]], and [[pressing]] have enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet to be discovered substances.<ref>
{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Audrey|coauthors=Audia Barnett, Olive-Jean Burrows|title=Effect of Processing on Nutrient Content of Foods|journal=Cajanus|volume=37|issue=3|pages=160–164|year=2004|url=http://www.paho.org/English/CFNI/cfni-caj37No304-art-3.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-26|format=PDF}}</ref> Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, [[potassium]]/[[sodium]], vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition,
processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.

A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of [[beri-beri]] in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin [[thiamine]], causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of [[scurvy]] among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.

As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g. nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.

===History===
Humans have evolved as [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s over the past 250,000 years. The diet of early modern humans varied significantly depending on location and climate. The diet in the tropics tended to be based more heavily on plant foods, while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products. Analysis of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic, along with detailed bone modification studies have shown that cannibalism was also prevalent among prehistoric humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Villa P, Bouville C, Courtin J, ''et al.'' |title=Cannibalism in the Neolithic |journal=Science |volume=233 |issue=4762 |pages=431–7 |year=1986 |month=July |pmid=17794567 |doi=10.1126/science.233.4762.431 }}</ref>

[[Agriculture]] developed about 10,000 years ago in multiple locations throughout the world, providing grains such as [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[potato]]es, and [[maize]], with staples such as [[bread]], [[pasta]], and [[tortilla]]s. Farming also provided milk and dairy products, and sharply increased the availability of meats and the diversity of vegetables. The importance of food purity was recognized when bulk storage led to infestation and contamination risks. [[Cooking]] developed as an often ritualistic activity, due to efficiency and reliability concerns requiring adherence to strict recipes and procedures, and in response to demands for food purity and consistency.<ref name=history>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060824032910/http://rcw.raiuniversity.edu/biotechnology/MScBioinformatics/generalnutrition/lecture-notes/lecture-01.pdf ''History of the Study of Nutrition in Western Culture''] (Rai University lecture notes for General Nutrition course, 2004)</ref>

====From antiquity to 1900====

[[Image:Anaxagoras.png|thumb|left|Anaxagoras]]

Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contained "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.<ref name=history /> Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]] said, "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."<ref name="Smith">{{cite journal | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7433/0-g | title=Let food by thy medicine… | author=Smith, Richard | journal=BMJ |date=24 January 2004| volume=328 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g | pages=0-g | issue=7433}}</ref>

In the 16th century, scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle. In 1747, Dr. [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment, discovering that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. The discovery was ignored for forty years, after which British sailors became known as "limeys." The essential [[vitamin C]] within lime juice would not be identified by scientists until the 1930s.

Around 1770, [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the "Father of Nutrition and Chemistry" discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat.  In 1790, [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for fowl survival. In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] were recognized as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.

In 1816, [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]] lost their body [[protein]] and died in a few weeks, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.{{cn|date=April 2013}}  In 1840, [[Justus Liebig]] discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates ([[sugar]]s), fats ([[fatty acid]]s) and proteins ([[amino acid]]s.)  In the 1860s, [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].

In the early 1880s, [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease.

In 1896, Eugen Baumann observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands. In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi, but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as [[thiamine]].

====From 1900 to the present====
[[File:Frederick Gowland Hopkins nobel.jpg|140px|thumb|[[Frederick Hopkins]], discoverer of vitamins and Nobel Laureate]]
In the early 20th century, [[Carl Von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition.  In 1906, Wilcock and Hopkins showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] was necessary for the survival of rats.  He fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed were essential for survival, but the rats died. A second group of rats were fed an amount of milk containing [[vitamin]]s. Sir [[Frederick Hopkins]] recognized "accessory food factors" other than calories, protein and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], as [[Organic compound|organic]] materials essential to health, but which the body cannot synthesize.   In 1907, [[Stephen M. Babcock]] and [[Edwin B. Hart]] conducted the [[single-grain experiment]], which took nearly four years to complete.

In 1912, [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]], a vital factor in the diet, from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to be derived from ammonia.  The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century.

In 1913, [[Elmer McCollum]] discovered the first vitamins, fat soluble [[vitamin A]], and water soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil.<ref>[http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D] – a paper funded by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]</ref> In 1922, Elmer McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets.  Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discover [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, originally calling it "food factor X" until 1925.

In 1925, Hart discovered that trace amounts of [[copper]] are necessary for [[iron]] absorption.  In 1927, [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, for which he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935 he synthesized it, and in 1937, he won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]].

In the 1930s, [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components which the body cannot synthesize.  In 1935, Underwood and Marston independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]].  In 1936, [[Eugene Floyd Dubois]] showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake. In 1938, [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E. It was synthesised by [[Paul Karrer]].

In 1940, [[rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II]] took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941, the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs) were established by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]].

In 1992, The U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]].  In 2002, a [[Natural Justice]] study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.  In 2005, a study found that obesity may be caused by [[adenovirus]] in addition to bad nutrition.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/854584.stm "Can a virus make you fat?"] at [[BBC News]]; [http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/contagious_obesity_identifying_the_human_adenoviruses_that_may_make_us_fat_9901 "Contagious obesity?

==Plant nutrition==
{{Main|Plant nutrition}}
Plant nutrition is the study of the [[chemical element]]s that are necessary for plant growth. There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.

A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]], is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 17 essential plant nutrients.

Macronutrients:
*N = [[Nitrogen]]
*P = [[Phosphorus]]
*K = [[Potassium]]
*Ca = [[Calcium]]
*Mg = [[Magnesium]]
*S = [[Sulfur]]
*Si = [[Silicon]]

Micronutrients (trace levels) include:
*Cl = [[Chlorine]]
*Fe = [[Iron]]
*B = [[Boron]]
*Mn = [[Manganese]]
*Na = [[Sodium]]
*Zn = [[Zinc]]
*Cu = [[Copper]]
*Ni=  [[Nickel]]
*Mo = [[Molybdenum]]

===Macronutrients===
'''Calcium'''
:Calcium regulates transport of other nutrients into the plant and is also involved in the activation of certain plant enzymes. [[Calcium deficiency (plant disorder)|Calcium deficiency]] results in stunting.

'''Nitrogen'''
:Nitrogen is an essential component of all proteins. [[Nitrogen deficiency]] most often results in stunted growth.

'''Phosphorus'''
:Phosphorus is important in plant [[Biological thermodynamics|bioenergetics]]. As a component of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], phosphorus is needed for the conversion of light energy to chemical energy (ATP) during photosynthesis. Phosphorus can also be used to modify the activity of various enzymes by [[phosphorylation]], and can be used for [[cell signaling]]. Since ATP can be used for the [[biosynthesis]] of many plant [[biomolecule]]s, phosphorus is important for plant growth and [[flower]]/[[seed]] formation.

'''Potassium'''
:Potassium regulates the opening and closing of the [[stomata|stoma]] by a potassium ion pump. Since stomata are important in water regulation, potassium reduces water loss from the leaves and increases [[drought]] tolerance. [[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] may cause necrosis or interveinal chlorosis.

'''Silicon'''
:Silicon is deposited in [[cell wall]]s and contributes to its mechanical properties including [[Stiffness|rigidity]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]

===Micronutrients===
'''Boron'''
:Boron is important in sugar transport, [[cell division]], and synthesizing certain enzymes. [[Boron deficiency (plant disorder)|Boron deficiency]] causes necrosis in young leaves and stunting.

'''Copper'''
:Copper is important for photosynthesis. Symptoms for copper deficiency include chlorosis. Involved in many enzyme processes. Necessary for proper photosynthesis. Involved in the manufacture of lignin (cell walls). Involved in grain production.

'''Chlorine'''
:Chlorine is necessary for [[osmosis]] and [[ionic balance]]; it also plays a role in [[photosynthesis]].

'''Iron'''
:Iron is necessary for photosynthesis and is present as an enzyme cofactor in plants. [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|Iron deficiency]] can result in interveinal [[chlorosis]] and [[necrosis]].

'''Manganese'''
:Manganese is necessary for building the [[chloroplast]]s. [[Manganese deficiency (plant)|Manganese deficiency]] may result in coloration abnormalities, such as discolored spots on the [[foliage]].

'''Molybdenum'''
:Molybdenum is a cofactor to enzymes important in building amino acids.

'''Nickel'''
:In [[vascular plant|higher plants]], Nickel is essential for activation of [[urease]], an enzyme involved with [[nitrogen metabolism]] that is required to process urea. Without Nickel, toxic levels of urea accumulate, leading to the formation of necrotic lesions. In [[Non-vascular plant|lower plants]], Nickel activates several enzymes involved in a variety of processes, and can substitute for Zinc and Iron as a cofactor in some enzymes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Sodium'''
:Sodium is involved in the regeneration of [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] in [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] and [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] plants. It can also substitute for potassium in some circumstances.

'''Zinc'''
:Zinc is required in a large number of enzymes and plays an essential role in [[DNA transcription]]. A typical symptom of zinc deficiency is the stunted growth of leaves, commonly known as "little leaf" and is caused by the oxidative degradation of the growth hormone [[auxin]].

===Processes===
Plants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (mainly consisting of nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]].Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil.
.Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Although [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants therefore require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by largely inert atmospheric nitrogen being changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.<ref>Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R. (2003) [http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/welcome.html Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes]. New Mexico State University/</ref>

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given [[cloning|clone]]. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice-versa.
