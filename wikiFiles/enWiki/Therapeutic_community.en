'''Therapeutic community''' is a term applied to a participative, group-based approach to long-term [[mental illness]], [[personality disorders]] and [[drug addiction]]. The approach is usually residential, with the clients and therapists living together. It is based on [[milieu therapy]] principles, and includes [[group therapy|group psychotherapy]] as well as practical activities.

Therapeutic communities have gained some reputation for success in rehabilitation and patient satisfaction in [[UK|Britain]] and abroad.  In Britain, 'democratic analytic' therapeutic communities have tended to specialise in the treatment of moderate to severe personality disorders and complex emotional and interpersonal problems.  The evolution of therapeutic communities in the United States has followed a different path with hierarchically arranged communities (or concept houses) specialising in the treatment of drug and alcohol dependence.

==History==

===UK===

The term was coined by [[Thomas Main]] in his 1946 paper, "The hospital as a therapeutic institution",<ref name="Main">{{cite journal |author=Main T. |title=The Hospital as a Therapeutic Institution |journal=Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic |volume=10 |issue= |pages=66–70 |year=1946 |month= |pmid= |pmc= |doi=|url=}}</ref><ref>Reproduced in {{cite book |title=The Ailment and other psychoanalytic essays |last=Main |first=Tom |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1989 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=1-85343-105-2 |pages= }}</ref> and subsequently developed by others including Maxwell Jones, [[R. D. Laing]] at the [[Philadelphia Association]], [[David Cooper]] at Villa 21, and Joshua Bierer.

Under the influence of Maxwell Jones, Main, Wilmer and others (Caudill 1958; Rapoport 1960), combined with the publications of critiques of the existing mental health system (Greenblatt et al. 1957, Stanton and Schwartz 1954) and the sociopolitical influences that permeated the psychiatric world towards the end of and following the [[World War II|second World War]], the concept of the therapeutic community and its attenuated form&nbsp;– the therapeutic milieu&nbsp;– caught on and dominated the field of inpatient psychiatry throughout the 1960s. The aim of therapeutic communities was a more democratic, user-led form of therapeutic environment, avoiding the authoritarian and demeaning practices of many psychiatric establishments of the time. The central philosophy is that clients are active participants in their own and each other's mental health treatment and that responsibility for the daily running of the community is shared among the clients and the staff. 'TC's have sometimes eschewed or limited [[psychiatric drug|medication]] in favor of group-based therapies.

The availability of the treatment on the [[National Health Service]] in the [[United Kingdom]] has recently been threatened because of changes in funding systems.  Researchers at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[King's College London]] studied a national democratic therapeutic community service over four years and found external policy 'steering' by officials eroded the community's democratic model of care, which in turn destabilised its well established approach to clinical risk management (this had been jointly developed by clients and staff).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|coauthors=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}</ref>  [http://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] (2012), who studied this community's development at first hand, described how an 'intractable conflict' between embedded and externally imposed management models led to escalating organizational 'turbulence', producing an interorganizational crisis which led to the unit's forced closure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}</ref> However, development of 'mini' therapeutic communities, meeting for three or fewer days each week and supported out of hours by various forms of 'service user led informal networks of care' (for example telephone, texting and physical support), now offers a more resource and cost effective alternative to traditional inpatient therapeutic communities.  The most recent exponent, the North Cumbria model, uses a dedicated out of hours website moderated  by service users according to therapeutic community principles.  This extends the community beyond the face to face 'therapeutic days'.  The website guarantees a safe group-based response not always possible with other systems.

===USA===

In the late 1960s within the US correctional system, the Asklepion Foundation initiated therapeutic communities in the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|Marion Federal Penitentiary]] and other institutions that included clinical intervention based upon [[Transactional Analysis]], the [[Synanon]] Game, internal [[twelve-step program]]s and other therapeutic modalities. Some of these programs lasted into the mid 1980s, such as the House of Thought in the [[Virginia Department of Corrections|Virginia Correctional system]], and were able to demonstrate a reduction of 17% in [[recidivism]] in a matched-pair study of drug-abusing [[felony|felon]]s and [[sex offender]]s who participated in the program for one year or more.

Modified therapeutic communities are currently used for substance abuse treatment in correctional facilities of several [[U.S. state]]s including  [[Pennsylvania]],<ref>[http://www.cor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/department_of_corrections/4604 Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]</ref> [[Texas]],<ref>[http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/pgm&svcs/pgms&svcs-subabus3.htm Texas Department of Criminal Justice]</ref> [[Delaware]],<ref>[http://www.mid-attc.org/leadership/ppt/James%20Lassiter-Therapeutic%20Community%20in%20a%20Correctional%20Setting.ppt#1 Therapeutic Community In a Correctional Setting]</ref> and [[New York]].<ref>[http://www.asapnys.org/TCA.htm Therapeutic Communities Association of New York State]</ref> In [[New York City]], a program for men is located in the [[Arthur Kill Correctional Facility]] on [[Staten Island]] and the women’s program is part of the [[Bayview Correctional Facility]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref>[http://www.staynout.org/staynout.php Stay'n Out: In-prison Treatment Programs for Men & Women]</ref>
