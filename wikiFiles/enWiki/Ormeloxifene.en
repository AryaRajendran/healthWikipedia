'''Ormeloxifene''' (also known as '''centchroman''') is one of the [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s,<ref name="pmid18675966">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.04.018 |title=Effect of ormeloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on biomarkers of endometrial receptivity and pinopode development and its relation to fertility and infertility in Indian subjects |year=2009 |last1=Makker |first1=Annu |last2=Tandon |first2=Indu |last3=Goel |first3=Madhu Mati |last4=Singh |first4=Mastan |last5=Singh |first5=Man Mohan |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=2298–307 |pmid=18675966}}</ref> or SERMs, a class of medication which acts on the estrogen receptor. It is best known as a non-hormonal, non-steroidal oral contraceptive which is taken once per week. In India, ormeloxifene has been available as [[birth control]] since the early 1990s, and it is currently marketed there under the trade name  '''Saheli'''.<ref name="url<< HLL - Product Overview >>">{{cite web |url=http://www.hindlatex.com/TipsnGuidesdetails.aspx?valid=1&category=0&id=170&type=25 |title=<< HLL - Product Overview >> |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Ormeloxifene has also been licensed under the trade names '''Novex-DS''', '''Centron''' and '''Sevista'''.

==Medical uses==
Ormeloxifene is primarily used as a contraceptive but may also be effective for [[dysfunctional uterine bleeding]] and advanced [[breast cancer]].<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=J|title=Clinical pharmacokinetics and interaction of centchroman--a mini review.|journal=Contraception|date=2010 Apr|volume=81|issue=4|pages=275–80|pmid=20227542}}</ref>

===Birth control===
Ormeloxifene may be used as a weekly oral contraceptive.<ref name=Review10/>  The weekly schedule is an advantage for women who prefer an oral contraceptive, but find it difficult or impractical to adhere to a daily schedule required by other oral contraceptives.

For the first twelve weeks of use, it is advised to take the ormeloxifene pill twice per week.<ref name=Review10/>  From the thirteenth week on, it is taken once per week.<ref name=Review10/><ref>http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1advances/old/1centch/ceorvw.htm</ref>
The consensus is that backup protection in the first month is a cautious but sensible choice.  A standard dose is 30&nbsp;mg weekly, but 60&nbsp;mg loading doses can reduce pregnancy rates by 38%.<ref name="pmid11257249">{{cite journal | author = Lal J, Nitynand S, Asthana OP, Nagaraja NV, Gupta RC | title = Optimization of contraceptive dosage regimen of Centchroman | journal = Contraception | volume = 63 | issue = 1 |pages = 47–51 | year = 2001 | month = January | pmid = 11257249 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(00)00189-X }}</ref>

It has a failure rate of about 1-2% with ideal use which is slight less effective than found for [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s.<ref name="Singh 2001"/>

===Other indications===
* Ormeloxifene has also been tested in experimental setting as a treatment for [[menorrhagia]].<ref name="pmid19751337">{{cite journal | author = Kriplani A, Kulshrestha V, Agarwal N | title = Efficacy and safety of ormeloxifene in management of menorrhagia: a pilot study | journal = J.

==Adverse effects==
There are concerns that ormeloxifene may cause [[urinary incontinence]] or [[uterine prolapse]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shelly|first=W|coauthors=Draper, MW, Krishnan, V, Wong, M, Jaffe, RB|title=Selective estrogen receptor modulators: an update on recent clinical findings.|journal=Obstetrical & gynecological survey|date=2008 Mar|volume=63|issue=3|pages=163–81|pmid=18279543}}</ref>

==Method of action==

Ormeloxifene is a [[Selective estrogen receptor modulator|SERM]], or selective [[estrogen receptor]] modulator.  In some parts of the body, its action is estrogenic (e.g., bones), in other parts of the body, its action is anti-estrogenic (e.g., [[uterus]], breasts.<ref>Gara Rishi Kumar, Konwar Rituraj,  Bid Hemant K and MM Singh. In-vitro anti-cancer breast activity of ormeloxifene is mediated via induction of apoptosis and autophagy. 37th annual conference of the endocrine society of India. 30 nov-2 dec, 2007. Abstract p35.</ref><ref name="pmid18279897">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2007.11.028 |title=Centchroman induces G0/G1 arrest and Caspase-dependent Apoptosis involving Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 Human Breast Cancer Cells |year=2008 |last1=Nigam |first1=Manisha |last2=Ranjan |first2=Vishal |last3=Srivastava |first3=Swasti |last4=Sharma |first4=Ramesh |last5=Balapure |first5=Anil K. |journal=Life Sciences |volume=82 |issue=11–12 |pages=577–90 |pmid=18279897}}</ref>) It causes an asynchrony in the [[menstrual cycle]] between [[ovulation]] and the development of the uterine lining, although its exact mode of action is not well defined.  In clinical trials, it caused ovulation to occur later than it normally would in some women,<ref name="Singh 2001"/> but did not affect ovulation in the majority of women, while causing the lining of the uterus to build more slowly.  It speeds the transport of any fertilized egg through the [[fallopian tube]]s more quickly than is normal.<ref name="Singh 2001"/>  Presumably, this combination of effects creates an environment such that if fertilization occurs, implantation will not be possible.<ref name="Singh 2001">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/med.1011 |title=Centchroman, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, as a contraceptive and for the management of hormone-related clinical disorders |year=2001 |last1=Singh |first1=M.M. |journal=Medicinal Research Reviews |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=302–47 |pmid=11410933}}</ref>

==Marketing==
Ormeloxifene is only legally available in India as of 2009.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patil|first=Robin D. Tribhuwan & Benazir D.|title=Body image : human reproduction and birth control : a tribal perspective|year=2009|publisher=Discovery Pub.

Ormeloxifene has been tested and licensed as a form of birth control, as well as a treatment for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. It was first manufactured by [[Torrent Pharmaceuticals]], and marketed as birth control under the trade name '''Centron'''.  Centron was discontinued.  A new license for ormeloxifene was issued to [[Hindustan Latex Ltd.]], which now manufactures ormeloxifene as birth control under the trade name '''Saheli''','''Novex''' and '''Novex-DS'''.  Torrent Pharmaceuticals has resumed manufacture of ormeloxifene under the trade name '''Sevista''', as a treatment for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
