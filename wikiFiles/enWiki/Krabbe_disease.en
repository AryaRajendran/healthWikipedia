'''Krabbe disease''' (also known as '''globoid cell leukodystrophy'''<ref name="pmid17403939">{{cite journal |author=Lee WC, Tsoi YK, Troendle FJ, ''et al'' |title=Single-dose intracerebroventricular administration of galactocerebrosidase improves survival in a mouse model of globoid cell leukodystrophy |journal=FASEB J. |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=2520–7 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17403939 |doi=10.1096/fj.06-6169com |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17403939}}</ref> or '''galactosylceramide lipidosis''') is a rare, often fatal degenerative disorder that affects the [[myelin]] sheath of the [[nervous system]]. It is a form of [[sphingolipidosis]], as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of [[sphingolipids]]. This condition is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern. The disease is named after the Danish [[neurologist]] Knud Haraldsen Krabbe (1885-1965).<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1457}}</ref>

==Causes==
Krabbe disease is caused by [[mutation]]s in the [[GALC]] [[gene]] located on [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 14 (human)|14]] (14q31),<ref>{{cite web|title=Regional mapping of the human galactocerebrosidase gene (GALC) to 14q31 by in situ hybridization|doi=10.1159/000133703}}</ref> which causes a deficiency of an [[enzyme]] called [[galactocerebrosidase]]. In rare cases it may be caused by a lack of active [[saposin A]]. 

The build-up of unmetabolized lipids affects the growth of the nerve's protective myelin sheath (the covering that insulates many [[nerve]]s) and causes severe degeneration of motor skills. As part of a group of disorders known as [[leukodystrophy|leukodystrophies]], Krabbe disease results from the imperfect growth and development of myelin.

GALC deficiency also results in a build-up of a [[glycosphingolipid]] called [[Psychosine]]. It has been suggested Psychosine causes axonal degeneration in both the CNS and PNS by disrupting [[lipid rafts]] and may play a role in Krabbe disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Wing |last2=Kang |first2=Dongcheul |last3=Causevic |first3=Ena |last4=Herdt |first4=Aimee |last5=Eckman |first5=Elizabeth |last6=Eckman |first6=Christopher |title=Molecular Characterization of Mutations That Cause Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy and Pharmacological Rescue Using Small Molecule Chemical Chaperones |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |year=2010 |volume=30 |issue=16 |pages=5489–5497 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6383-09.2010 |pmid=20410102 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=White |first=Adam |last2=Givogri |first2=Maria |last3=Lopez-Rosas |first3=Aurora |last4=Cao |first4=Hongmei |last5=Breemen |first5=Richard van |last6=Thinakaran |first6=Gopal |last7=Bongarzone |first7=Ernesto |title=Psychosine Accumulates in Membrane Microdomains in the Brain of Krabbe Patients, Disrupting the Raft Architecture |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |year=2009 |volume=29 |issue=19 |pages=6068–6077 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5597-08.2009 |pmid=19439584 }}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Infants with Krabbe disease are normal at birth. Symptoms begin between the ages of 3 and 6 months with irritability, [[fever]]s, limb stiffness, [[seizure]]s, feeding difficulties, [[vomiting]], and slowing of mental and motor development. In the first stages of the disease, doctors often mistake the symptoms for those of [[cerebral palsy]]. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, spasticity, deafness, optic atrophy, optic nerve enlargement,<ref>{{cite pmid|21285037}}</ref> blindness, paralysis, and difficulty when swallowing. Prolonged weight loss may also occur. There are also juvenile- and adult-onset cases of Krabbe disease, which have similar symptoms but slower progression.

==Diagnosis==
The disease may be diagnosed by its characteristic grouping of certain cells ([[multinucleated globoid cells]]), nerve demyelination and degeneration, and destruction of brain cells. Special stains for [[myelin]] (e.g.; [[luxol fast blue]]) may be used to aid diagnosis.

==Prognosis==
In infants, the disease is generally fatal before age 2. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease and live significantly longer.

==Treatment==
Although there is no cure for Krabbe disease, [[bone marrow]] [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] has been shown to benefit cases early in the course of the disease. Generally, treatment for the disorder is symptomatic and supportive. [[Physical therapy]] may help maintain or increase [[muscle]] tone and circulation. A recent study in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reports that [[cord blood]] transplants have been successful in stopping the disease as long as they are given before overt symptoms appear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Escolar ML, Poe MD, Provenzale JM, Richards KC, Allison J, Wood S, Wenger DA, Pietryga D, Wall D, Champagne M, Morse R, Krivit W, Kurtzberg J |title=Transplantation of Umbilical-Cord Blood in Babies with Infantile Krabbe's Disease |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=352 |issue=20 |pages=2069–2081 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/352/20/2069 |year=2005 |pmid=15901860 |issn=0028-4793 |oclc=206940639 |id=BL Shelfmark 6084.000000 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa042604 }}</ref>

==Advocacy==
Former [[Buffalo Bills]] quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] has been a leader in gaining recognition and research funding for Krabbe disease, following the diagnosis of his son, Hunter, in 1997. Hunter Kelly died of the disease on August 5, 2005, at the age of 8.
