'''Hypertensive heart disease''' includes a number of complications of systemic arterial [[hypertension]] or high [[blood pressure]] that affect the [[heart]]. While there are several definitions of hypertensive heart disease in the medical literature,<ref>{{cite journal | authorformat = vanc | last1 = Alegría-Ezquerra | first1 = Eduardo | last2 = González-Juanatey | first2 = José R. | last3 = González-Maqueda | first3 = Isidoro  | title = Hypertensive heart disease: a proposed clinical classification | language = Spanish; Castilian | journal = [[Revista Española de Cardiología]] | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 398–9 | year = 2006  | month = April | pmid = 16709396 | url = http://www.revespcardiol.org/en/linksolver/ft/ivp/0300-8932/59/398 | doi = 10.1016/S1885-5857(06)60781-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | authorformat = vanc | last1 = Lip | first = G.

</ref> the term is most widely used in the context of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) coding categories. The definition in the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) includes [[heart failure]] and other cardiac complications of hypertension when a causal relationship between the heart disease and hypertension is stated or implied on the [[death certificate]]. According to ICD-10, hypertensive heart disease (I11), and its subcategories: hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0) and hypertensive heart disease without heart failure (I11.9) are distinguished from chronic [[rheumatic heart disease]]s (I05-I09),  other forms of heart disease (I30-I52) and [[ischemic heart disease]]s (I20-I25). However, since high blood pressure is a risk factor for [[atherosclerosis]] and ischemic heart disease,<ref name = "Messerli 1996">{{cite journal | authorformat = vanc | last1 = Grossman | first1 = E. | last2 = Messerli | first2 = F. H. | title = Diabetic and hypertensive heart disease | journal = [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] | volume = 125 | issue = 4 | pages = 304–310 | year = 1996 | month = August | pmid = 8678395 }}</ref> death rates from hypertensive heart disease provide an incomplete measure of the burden of disease due to high blood pressure.

==Symptoms and signs==
The symptoms and signs of hypertensive heart disease will depend on whether or not it is accompanied by [[heart failure]]. In the absence of heart failure, hypertension, with or without enlargement of the heart ([[left ventricular hypertrophy]]) is usually symptomless. 
Symptoms and signs of chronic heart failure can include: 
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]
* Irregular [[pulse]] or [[palpitations]]
* [[Edema|Swelling]] of feet and ankles
* [[Weight gain]]
* [[Nausea]]
* Shortness of [[breath]]
* Difficulty sleeping flat in bed ([[orthopnea]])
* [[Bloating]] and abdominal pain
* Greater need to [[urinate]] at night
* Altered mentation (in severe cases)
* An enlarged heart ([[cardiomegaly]])
Patients can present acutely with heart failure and [[pulmonary edema]] due to sudden failure of pump function of the heart. Acute heart failure can be precipitated by a variety of causes including [[myocardial ischemia]], marked increases in blood pressure, or [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]s, especially [[atrial fibrillation]]. Alternatively heart failure can develop insidiously over time.

==Differential diagnosis==
Other conditions can share features with hypertensive heart disease and need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. For example:
*Coronary artery disease or [[ischemic heart disease]] due to atherosclerosis
*[[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]
*Left ventricular hypertrophy in athletes
*Congestive heart failure or heart failure with normal ejection fraction due to other causes
*Atrial fibrillation or other disorders of cardiac rhythm due to other causes
*[[Sleep apnea]]

==Treatment==
The medical care of patients with hypertensive heart disease falls under 2 categories—<ref name=Medscape>{{cite web|last=Riaz|first=Kamran|title=Hypertensive Heart Disease|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/162449-overview|publisher=Medscape Reference|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref> 
* Treatment of the elevated BP 
* Prevention and treatment of hypertensive heart disease.

===Prevention===
Because there are no symptoms with high blood pressure, people can have the condition without knowing it. Diagnosing high blood pressure early can help prevent heart disease, stroke, eye problems, and chronic kidney disease.<ref name=Medline>{{cite web|title=Hypertensive heart disease|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000163.htm|publisher=Medline Plus|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>

===Blood Pressure Goals===
According to JNC 7, BP goals should be as follows :<ref name=JNC7 /> 
* Less than 140/90mm Hg in patients with uncomplicated hypertension
* Less than 130/85mm Hg in patients with diabetes and those with renal disease with less than 1g/24-hour proteinuria
* Less than 125/75mm Hg in patients with renal disease and more than 1 g/24-hour proteinuria
