A '''needle & syringe programme''' ('''NSP''') or '''syringe-exchange programme''' ('''SEP''') is a [[social policy]] based on the philosophy of [[harm reduction]] where [[Injection (medicine)|injecting]] drug users (IDUs) can obtain [[hypodermic needle]]s and associated injection equipment at little or no cost. Many programmes are called "exchanges" because some require exchanging used needles for an equal number of new needles, in order to discourage the incorrect discarding of used equipment. Other programmes do not have this requirement.<ref>[http://www.saferottawa.ca/html/needle_distribution.html Safer Ottawa]</ref>  The aim of these services is to reduce the damage associated with using unsterile or contaminated injecting equipment.

A comprehensive study by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2004 stated that there is a "compelling case that NSPs substantially and cost effectively reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs and do so without evidence of exacerbating injecting drug use at either the individual or societal level."<ref>{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Effectiveness of Sterile Needle and Syringe Programming in Reducing HIV/AIDS Among Injecting Drug Users |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2004/9241591641.pdf |publisher=Evidence for Action Technical Papers|accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> The WHO's findings have also been supported by the American Medical Association (AMA), which in 2000 adopted a position strongly supporting NSPs when combined with addiction counseling.<ref>{{cite pmid|11318395|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/1471-2458-3-37|noedit}}</ref>  A 2010 review of reviews led by Norah Palmateer which examined [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] on the topic concluded that there is insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the [[Hepatitis C virus]], tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of [[HIV]] and sufficient evidence that it reduces self-reported injecting risk behaviour.<ref name="pmid20219055">{{cite journal |author=Palmateer N, Kimber J, Hickman M, Hutchinson S, Rhodes T, Goldberg D |title=Evidence for the effectiveness of sterile injecting equipment provision in preventing hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus transmission among injecting drug users: a review of reviews |journal=Addiction |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=844–59 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20219055 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02888.x}}</ref>

==History and development==
[[Image:Sharps container - cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sharps container|"Sharps" container]] (for safe disposal of hypodermic needles)]]
Needle-exchange programmes can be traced back to informal activities undertaken during the 1970s, however the idea is likely to have been discovered a number of times in different locations. The first government-approved initiative was undertaken in the early to mid-1980s, with other initiatives following closely. While the initial Dutch programme was motivated by concerns regarding an outbreak of [[hepatitis B]], the AIDS pandemic motivated the rapid adoption of these programmes around the world.<ref>Ritter, A and Cameron, J (2006)  A Systematic Review of Harm Reduction, Drug Policy Modeling Project, Monograph 06, Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Center, University of Melbourne, December.</ref> This reflects the pragmatic response to the pandemic undertaken by some governments, and encapsulated in the harm reduction / minimization philosophy.

==Operation==
In addition to sterile needles, syringe-exchange programmes typically offer other services such as: HIV and Hepatitis C testing; alcohol swabs; bleach water and [[normal saline]] (often as rinse eye drops); aluminium "cookers"; citric acid powder (an imperative agent: enables heroin to dissolve in water); containers for needles and many other items.<ref>{{cite web|author=North American Syringe Exchange Network |year=2000|title=2000 National Syringe Exchange Survey|publisher=Harm Reduction Coalition|url=http://www.harmreduction.org/research/dbase/survey2000/dataMain.html}}</ref> There was a survey conducted by Beth Israel Medical Center in New York city and the North American Syringe Exchange Network, which showed among the 126 SEPs surveyed, 77% provided to material abuse therapy, 72% provided voluntary counselling and HIV testing, and more than two-thirds provided supplies such as bleach, alcohol pads, and male and [[female condom]]s.

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC), in the [[United States]] around 1/5 of all new HIV infections and the vast majority of Hepatitis C infections are the result of injection drug use.<ref name="United States 2005">{{cite journal |title=Update:Syringe Exchange Programs |date=15 July 2005 |volume=54 |issue=27 |pages=673–6 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5427a1.htm |pmid=16015218 |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

Needle-exchange programmes are supported by the CDC and the [[National Institute of Health]].<ref name="United States 2005"/><ref name="United States 2002">{{cite journal |pmid=12407572 |journal=Hepatology |date=2002 Nov |volume=36|issue=5 Suppl 1|pages=S3–20 |title=National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement: Management of hepatitis C: 2002--June 10–12, 2002 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840360703 |last1=National Institutes Of |first1=Health}}</ref> The NIH estimates that in the United States, between fifteen and twenty percent of injection drug users have HIV and at least seventy percent have hepatitis C.<ref name="United States 2002"/>

Proponents of [[harm reduction]] argue that the provision of a needle exchange therefore provides a social benefit in reducing health costs and also provides a means to dispose of used needles in a safe manner. For example, in the United Kingdom, as the keystone prevention method, proponents of SEPs assert that, along with other programs, they have reduced the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users. The most extensive review of research into their effectiveness backs this claim.<ref>United States Institute of Medicine {{cite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2006/Preventing-HIV-Infection-among-Injecting-Drug-Users-in-High-Risk-Countries-An-Assessment-of-the-Evidence.aspx |title=Preventing HIV Infection Among Injecting Drug Users in High-Risk Countries |accessdate=2010-01-09 }} <!-- This is from 2006. Isn't there something newer? --></ref> As a developed country, especially for medical care, the UK has been seen as a pioneer in establishing SEPs. These supposed benefits have led to an expansion of these programmes in most jurisdictions that have introduced them, aiming to increase geographical coverage, but also the availability of these services out of hours. [[Vending machine]]s which automatically dispense [http://www.harmreduction.co.uk/products_for_exchange.html injecting equipment "pack"] have been successfully introduced in a number of locations.<ref>{{cite web |author=McDonald D |year=2006 |title=ACT Syringe Vending Machines Trial 2004–2006, Progress Report No. 3, August to December 2005, and preliminary evaluation findings |publisher=Siggins Miller Consultants and Social Research & Evaluation Pty Ltd, Brisbane; Canberra |url=http://www.health.act.gov.au/c/health?a=sendfile&ft=p&fid=1157424055 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Islam MM, Conigrave KM |year=2007 |title=Syringe vending machines as a form of needle syringe program: Advantages and Disadvantages |journal=Journal of Substance Use |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=203–12 |doi=10.1080/14659890701249640}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Islam MM, Stern T, Conigrave KM, Wodak A |year=2008 |title=Client satisfaction and risk behaviours of the users of syringe dispensing machines: a pilot study |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev |date=2008 Jan |volume=27|issue=1|pages=13–9 |doi=10.1080/09595230701711199 |pmid=18034377}}</ref>

Another advantage cited by supporters of these programmes are that SEPs can not only protect attenders themselves, but also provide a safe environment for their social network such as sexual partners, children or neighbours. If people among injecting drug users (IDU) did not attend SEP or share injection equipment with programme attenders, SEPs can also have an indirect influence to control transmission risks. In fact, in those SEPs, nurses are very important in terms of spreading knowledge about HIV among IDUs. These programmes not only provide physical protection from HIV, they also facilitate education by teaching IDUs about blood-borne pathogens as well as how to protect themselves and others.

Other promoted benefits of these programmes include being a first point of contact for drug treatment,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brooner R, Kidorf M, King V, Beilenson P, Svikis D, Vlahov D |title=Drug abuse treatment success among needle exchange participants |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=113 Suppl 1 |issue= Suppl 1|pages=129–39 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9722818 |pmc=1307735}}</ref> access to health and counselling service referrals, the provision of up-to-date information about safe injecting practices, access to condoms, and as a means for data collection from injecting drug users about their behaviour and/or drug use patterns. SEP outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. These are known as 'targeted primary health care outlet'- as these outlets primarily target people who inect drugs and/or '[[Low-threshold treatment programs|low-threshold health care outlet]]'- as these reduce common barriers clients often face when they try to access health care from the conventional health care outlets,.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Day, CA, Dawson, A and Conigrave, KM |title=The accessibility, acceptability, health impact and cost implications of primary healthcare outlets that target injecting drug users: A narrative synthesis of literature |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=94–102 |year=2012 |pmid=21996165 |url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(11)00159-9/abstract |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.08.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Day, CA, Dawson, A and Conigrave, KM |title=Primary healthcare outlets that target injecting drug users: Opportunity to make services accessible and acceptable to the target group |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=109–110 |year=2012 |pmid=22280917 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.11.001}}</ref> For accessing sterile injecting equipment clients frequently visit SEP outlets, and these frequent visit are used opportunistically to offer much needed health care.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Reid, SE, White, A, Grummett, S, Conigrave, KM and Haber, PS |title=Opportunistic and continuing health care for injecting drug users from a nurse-run needle syringe program-based primary health-care clinic |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev |volume=31 |pages=114–115 |year=2012 |pmid=22145983 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x/pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM |title=Needle Syringe Program-Based Primary Health Care Centers: Advantages and Disadvantages |journal=Journal of Primary Care & Community Health |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=100–103 |url=http://jpc.sagepub.com/content/1/2/100.abstract}}</ref>

These services can take on a wide range of configurations:
* Primary needle and syringe programme ("stand alone" service)
* Secondary needle and syringe programme (such as incorporated within a pharmacy or health service)
* Mobile or on-call Service
* Dispensing machine distribution ("vending machine")
* Peer service: distribution networks
* Peer service: "flooding" or mass distribution
* Peer service: underground
* Prison-based facilities
* Distribution of bleach or other cleaning equipment (rather than needles and syringes)
* [[Ad hoc]] or informal distribution

Countries where these programmes exist include: [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Iran]] and the [[United States]]. In the United States such programmes may not receive federal funding, but this ban was briefly lifted in 2009 before being re-instated in 2010. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis C, Beletsky L |title=Bundling occupational safety with harm reduction information as a feasible method for improving police receptiveness to syringe access programs: evidence from three U.S. cities|journal=Harm Reduct J |url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&id= |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=6 |issue=16 |year=2009 }}</ref>

===Funding===
The use of federal funds for needle-exchange programs was banned in the [[United States of America]] in 1988, but this ban was overturned in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sharon|first=Susan|title=Ban Lifted On Federal Funding For Needle Exchange|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121511681|accessdate=2011-03-25|newspaper=NPR|date=2009-12-09}}</ref> In the time before the federal funding ban was re-instated by the US Congress in 2011, at least three programs were able to obtain federal funds and two thirds reported planning to pursue such funding.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Green TC, Martin E, Bowman S, Mann M, Beletsky, L |title=Life After the Ban: An Assessment of US Syringe Exchange Programs’ Attitudes About and Early Experiences with Federal Funding|journal=Am.

===Legal Aspects===
In the past, many U.S. states criminalized the possession of needles without a prescription, even going so far as to arrest people as they leave private needle-exchange facilities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Case P, Meehan T, Jones TS |title=Arrests and incarceration of injection drug users for syringe possession in Massachusetts: implications for HIV prevention |journal=J.

Despite the legal changes, gaps between the formal law and the street-level environment create an environment where many programs continue to face law enforcement interference (see law enforcement section below).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. |title=Attitudes of Police Officers Towards Syringe Access, Occupational Needle-Sticks, and Drug Use: A Qualitative Study of One City Police Department in the United States. |journal=Int’l.

One such state operating with covert needle operations is Colorado.  Current laws in Colorado leave room for interpretation on the requirement of a prescription to purchase syringes.  Because of this law the majority of pharmacies will not sell needles without prescription, and police will arrest people in possession needles without prescription.<ref>[http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102187404.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>  Groups including The Works (Boulder) and The Underground Syringe Exchange of Denver (the USED) attempt to ease the burden this legislation places on IDUs in Colorado.  Both exchanges operate covertly to avoid legal prosecution and are entirely funded by donations and operated by volunteers.  Because of the illegal nature of the organization, the USED website specifies that new clients must be referred in order to exchange needles.  Both organizations have been highly successful in supplying IDUs with an alternative to using dirty needles.  According to The Works website this year they have received over 45,000 dirty needles, and distributed around 45,200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bouldercounty.org/health/hpe/STI/exchange.htm |title=Boulder County Public Health |publisher=Bouldercounty.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref>

==Law Enforcement==

===Interference with NEP, regardless of the law===

Removal of legal barriers to operation of NEPs and other syringe access initiatives has been identified as an important part of a comprehensive approach to reducing HIV transmission among IDUs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=S Burris, D Finucane, H Gallagher, and J Grace |title=The legal strategies used in operating syringe exchange programs in the United States. |journal=Am J Public Health |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1380633/pdf/amjph00519-0107.pdf |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=86 |year=1996 |pmc=1380633 |pmid=8712281 |issue=8 |pages=1161–6}}</ref>  Legal barriers include both "law on the books" and "law on the streets," i.e., the actual practices of law enforcement officers,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burris, S., Blankenship, K.

Changes in syringe and drug control policy can be ineffective in reducing such barriers if police continue to treat syringe possession as a crime or participation in NEP as evidence of criminal activity.

In multivariate modeling, legal status of the program (operating legally vs illegally), jurisdiction’s syringe regulation environment were not associated with frequency of police interference.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R.|title=The roles of law, client race and program visibility in shaping police interference with the operation of US syringe exchange programs. |journal=Addiction |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=106 |issue=2 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x |pmid=21054615 |pmc=3088513}}</ref>  This finding confirms a substantial gap between the formal law and its enforcement by police.  

A detailed 2011 analysis of NEP client experiences in Los Angeles suggested that as many as 7% of clients report negative encounters with security officers in any given month.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Sorensen A, Wagner K, Davidson P. |title=The State of the Row: Syringe Exchange Client’s Experiences with Police and Private Security Personnel in Downtown Los Angeles. |journal=HHCLA |year=2011 }}</ref> Given that syringes are not prohibited in the jurisdiction and their confiscation can only occur as part of an otherwise authorized arrest, almost 40% of those who reported syringe confiscation were not arrested. This<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Sorensen A, Wagner K, Davidson P. |title=The State of the Row: Syringe Exchange Client’s Experiences with Police and Private Security Personnel in Downtown Los Angeles. |journal=HHCLA |year=2011 }}</ref> raises concerns about extrajudicial confiscation of personal property. Approximately 25% of the encounters detailed by respondents involved private security personnel, rather than local police.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Sorensen A, Wagner K, Davidson P. |title=The State of the Row: Syringe Exchange Client’s Experiences with Police and Private Security Personnel in Downtown Los Angeles. |journal=HHCLA |year=2011 }}</ref>

===Racial Gradient===

NEPs serving predominantly IDUs of color may be almost 4 times more likely to report frequent client arrest en route to or from the program and almost 4 times more likely to report unauthorized syringe confiscation from clients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R.|title=The roles of law, client race and program visibility in shaping police interference with the operation of US syringe exchange programs. |journal=Addiction |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=106 |issue=2 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x |pmid=21054615 |pmc=3088513}}</ref>  A 2005 study in Philadelphia found that Black individuals accessing the city's legally operated exchange decreased at more than twice the rate of white individuals after the initiation of a police anti-drug operation. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis CS, Burris S, Becher J, Lynch K, Metzger D |title=Effects of an Intensive Street-Level Police Intervention on Syringe Exchange Program Use in Philadelphia, PA |journal=American Journal of Public Health |accessdate=2012-8-15 |volume=95 |issue=2 |year=2005 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2003.033563 |pmid=15671455 |pmc=1449157}}</ref> These and other findings illustrate a possible mechanism by which racial disparities in the criminal justice enforcement can translate into disparities in HIV transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iguchi MY, Bell J, Ramchand RN, Fain T. |title=How criminal system racial disparities may translate into health disparities. |journal=J Health Care Poor Underserved |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=16 |issue=4 Suppl B |pages=48–56  |year=2005 |pmid=16327107 |doi=10.1353/hpu.2005.0114}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Sorensen A, Wagner K, Davidson P. |title=The State of the Row: Syringe Exchange Client’s Experiences with Police and Private Security Personnel in Downtown Los Angeles. |journal=HHCLA |year=2011 }}</ref> Notably, the majority (56%) of respondents reported not documenting adverse police events; those who did were 2.92 times more likely to report unauthorized syringe confiscation from clients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R.|title=The roles of law, client race and program visibility in shaping police interference with the operation of US syringe exchange programs. |journal=Addiction |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=106 |issue=2 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x |pmid=21054615 |pmc=3088513}}</ref> These findings suggest that systematic surveillance and interventions are needed to address police interference. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. |title=Attitudes of Police Officers Towards Syringe Access, Occupational Needle-Sticks, and Drug Use: A Qualitative Study of One City Police Department in the United States. |journal=Int’l.

===Causes=== 
Police interference with legal NEP operations may be partially explained by poor knowledge and the lack of targeted education of police about the law and public health rationale relating to the operation of such programs. A study of police officers in an urban police department four years after the decriminalization of syringe purchase and possession in the US state of Rhode Island suggested that up to a third of police officers were not aware that the law had changed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. |title=Attitudes of Police Officers Towards Syringe Access, Occupational Needle-Sticks, and Drug Use: A Qualitative Study of One City Police Department in the United States. |journal=Int’l. J. Drug Pol’y |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=872756 |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=267–274 |year=2005 }}</ref> This knowledge gap parallels other areas of public health law, underscoring pervasive gaps in dissemination.  <ref>{{cite journal |author=Burris S, Beletsky L, Burleson J, Case P, and Lazzarini Z.|title=Do Criminal Laws Influence HIV Risk Behavior? An Empirical Trial |journal=Arizona State Law Journal |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=977274 |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=2007 |issue=03 |year=2007 }}</ref> 

Even police officers with accurate knowledge of the law, however, reported intention to confiscate syringes from drug users as a way to address problematic substance abuse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. |title=Attitudes of Police Officers Towards Syringe Access, Occupational Needle-Sticks, and Drug Use: A Qualitative Study of One City Police Department in the United States. |journal=Int’l.

Drug Pol’y |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=872756 |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=267–274 |year=2005 }}</ref>  Police also reported being anxious about accidental needle sticks and acquiring communicable diseases from IDUs, but were not trained or equipped to deal with this occupational risk; this anxiety was intertwined with negative attitudes towards syringe access initiatives.

===Training, Interventions to Address Law Enforcement Barriers===

Police trainings by US NEPs have been shown to be feasible, especially when framed from the standpoint of addressing police occupational safety and human resources concerns.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis C, Beletsky L |title=Bundling occupational safety with harm reduction information as a feasible method for improving police receptiveness to syringe access programs: evidence from three U.S. cities|journal=Harm Reduct J |url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&id= |accessdate=2012-7-5 |volume=6 |issue=16 |year=2009 }}</ref>  Preliminary evidence also suggests that such trainings can shift police knowledge and attitudes regarding NEPs specifically and public health-based approaches towards problematic drug use in general.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Agrawal A, Moreau B, Kumar P, Weiss-Laxer N, Heimer R. |title=Police training to align law enforcement and HIV prevention: preliminary evidence from the field.|journal=Am J Public Health |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300254?journalCode=ajph |volume=101 |issue=11 |pages=2012–2015 |year=2011 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300254}}</ref>

According to 2011 survey, 20% US NEPs reported participating in police trainings during the previous year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. |title=Prevalence, characteristics, and predictors of police training initiatives by US SEPs: Building an evidence base for structural interventions |journal=Drug Alcohol Dependence |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871611002602 |volume=119 |issue=1-2 |pages=145–149 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.05.034}}</ref> Covered topics included the public health rationale behind NEPs (71%), police occupational health (67%), needle stick injury (62%), NEPs’ legal status (57%), and harm reduction philosophy (67%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. |title=Prevalence, characteristics, and predictors of police training initiatives by US SEPs: Building an evidence base for structural interventions |journal=Drug Alcohol Dependence |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871611002602 |volume=119 |issue=1-2 |pages=145–149 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.05.034}}</ref>  On average, trainings were seen as moderately effective, but only four programs reported conducting any formal evaluation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. |title=Prevalence, characteristics, and predictors of police training initiatives by US SEPs: Building an evidence base for structural interventions |journal=Drug Alcohol Dependence |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871611002602 |volume=119 |issue=1-2 |pages=145–149 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.05.034}}</ref>  Assistance with police trainings was identified by 72% of respondents as the key to improving police relations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. |title=Prevalence, characteristics, and predictors of police training initiatives by US SEPs: Building an evidence base for structural interventions |journal=Drug Alcohol Dependence |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871611002602 |volume=119 |issue=1-2 |pages=145–149 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.05.034}}</ref>

===Anti-Needle Exchange Arguments===

*Popularity of Needle Exchange programs has grown over time, more than quadrupling in six years from 1993-1999.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vlahov D., Des Jarlais D., Goosby E., Hollinger P., Lurie P., Shriver M., Strathdee S. | year = 2001 | title = Needle exchange programs for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection: Epidemiology and policy | url = | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 154 | issue = 12| pages = 70–77 }}</ref>
**Despite discussions for federal funding of Needle Exchange Programs since President [[Bill Clinton]]’s administration, the U.S. has yet to implement a permanent change in its federal policy.

==Opposition==

=== Discarded needles dangerous to the community ===

An Australian bi-partisan Federal Parliamentary inquiry which published recommendations in 2003 registered government concern about the lack of accountability of Australia’s needle exchanges, inadequate exchange and lack of a national register of resulting needle stick injuries.<ref>
