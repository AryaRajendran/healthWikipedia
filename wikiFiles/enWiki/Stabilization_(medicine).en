'''Stabilization''' is a process to help prevent [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] in sick or injured people. Stabilization is often performed by the [[Certified first responder|first person to arrive]] on scene, [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s or [[nurse]]s before or just after arrival in hospital.  It includes controlling bleeding, arranging for proper [[patient evacuation|evacuation]], keeping patients warm with blankets, and calming them by providing personal attention and concern for their well-being.

It is particularly important in [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] cases where [[vertebral column|spinal]] injury is suspected to immobilize the cervical spine, or back.  Failure to do so can cause permanent paralysis or death. In the field, [[spinal stabilization]] involves moving the person's back as a single unit with as many as 5 rescuers assisting, then applying a [[cervical collar]] (which can be improvised from duct tape and cardboard), and securing victims to a solid-backed stretcher, [[long spine board]], or a [[vacuum mattress]]. 

[[Search and rescue|Search and Rescue Technician]] (aka SARTech.)  trained in [[wilderness first aid]] have a protocol for verifying that the spine has not been hurt ([[clearing the cervical spine]]) when the victim is several hours or more from the [[hospital]] and evacuation may not be indicated.  Without this technique it may be necessary to carry a suspected trauma victim out only to discover that he had no injury worthy of the effort and expense.
