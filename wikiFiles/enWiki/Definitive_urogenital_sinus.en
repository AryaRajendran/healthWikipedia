The '''definitive urogenital sinus''' (also known as the '''[[persistent cloaca]]''') is a part of the human body only present in the [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]].  It is the ventral part of the cloaca, formed after the [[cloaca (embryology)|cloaca]] separates from the [[anal canal]] during the fourth to seventh weeks of development.<ref name="langman243-244">{{cite book|last=Sadler|first=T.W.|title=Langman's Medical Embryology|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9069-7|pages=243â€“244}}</ref>

In males, the UG sinus is divided into three regions: upper, pelvic, and phallic.   The upper part gives rise to the [[urinary bladder]] and the pelvic part gives rise to the prostatic and membranous parts of the [[urethra]].<ref name="langman243-244"/>

In females, the pelvic part of the UG sinus gives rise to the [[sinovaginal bulbs]], structures that will eventually form the inferior portion of the [[vagina]].  This process begins when the lower tip of the [[paramesonephric ducts]], the structures that will eventually form the [[uterus]] and [[vaginal fornices]], come in contact with the UG sinus.  Shortly afterwards, the [[sinovaginal bulbs]] form as two solid evaginations of the UG sinus. Cells in these bulbs divide to form a solid [[vaginal plate]], which extends and then canalizes (hollows) to form the inferior portion of the [[vagina]].<ref name="langman253">{{cite book|last=Sadler|first=T.W.|title=Langman's Medical Embryology|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9069-7|pages=253}}</ref>

==Pathology==
A '''urogenital sinus anomaly''' is also a rare [[birth defect]] in [[women]] where the [[urethra]] and [[vagina]] both open into a common channel.
