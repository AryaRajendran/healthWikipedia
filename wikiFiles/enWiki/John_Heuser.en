'''John E. Heuser''' (born  August 29, 1942) is a Professor of [[Biophysics]] in the department of [[Cell Biology]] and [[Physiology]] at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]<ref>http://www.heuserlab.wustl.edu/</ref> as well as a Professor at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Matieral Sciences (iCeMS) at [[Kyoto University]].<ref>http://www.icems.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e/ppl/grp/heuser.html</ref> Heuser created quick-freeze deep-etch [[electron microscopy]], a pioneering technique that lets biologists take detailed pictures of fleeting events inside living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. For decades, Heuser has used this technique to capture details of the molecular mechanisms that underlie many basic biological activities, including [[nerve cell]] signal transmission, [[muscle contraction]], and most recently, the fusion of [[viruses]] with cells during the spread of [[infection]]. He compares quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy to using a stroboscopic flash to freeze the action in a [[photograph]]. To make it possible to image the frozen sample with an electron microscope, Heuser adds an ultra-thin film of metallic [[platinum]] that molds snugly against the sample's frozen surface contours. He and others in his lab have worked to make the equipment and procedures necessary for this process available to researchers around the world. Currently Heuser has patents pending on [[Washington University]]'s behalf for even more advanced versions of his quick-freezing machines. Heuser graduated [[magna cum laude]] from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1969 and joined the Washington University faculty as a professor of [[biophysics]] in 1980. He is currently associate editor of the Journal of Neurocytology and previously served as associate editor of the Journal of Cell Biology. His [[curriculum vitae]] lists over 200 scientific publications.<ref>http://www.heuserlab.wustl.edu/heuser-cv.shtml</ref> He was elected as a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] class of 2005<ref>http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/5218.aspx</ref> and of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 2007. Heuser was also elected as a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2011.<ref>http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=News_May_3_2011_member_election</ref>

*Freeze-etch [[electron microscopy]] as applied to cell and molecular biology
*The structural basis of neuronal [[synaptic transmission]]
Heuser explains what is done in his laboratory:

<blockquote>
"Electron microscopic visualization of everything from whole cells to individual molecules is the work of this laboratory. Special emphasis is given to developing new methods of sample preparation that will achieve a more natural, life-like appearance of samples in the microscope. To accomplish this, we have developed what is now called the "quick-freeze, deep-etch" technique for electron microscopy and have disseminated the equipment and procedures needed to carry out this technique throughout the field. Currently, we use "quick-freezing" to capture several different cellular processes that are unusually fleeting, including membrane budding and fusion, synaptic vesicle discharge during neural transmission, movement of [[cilia]] and [[flagella]] on [[vertebrate]] and [[protozoal]] cells, and muscle contraction. In each case, our aim has been to visualize the underlying molecular mechanisms occurring. We also use "deep-etching" to visualize molecules [[adsorbed]] to inert substrates in order to study mechanisms of [[macromolecular]] assembly and disassembly in various processes, including remodeling of cytoskeletons, [[clathrin]]-mediated [[endocytosis]], cell-to-cell recognition, and the formation of extracellular matrices."
