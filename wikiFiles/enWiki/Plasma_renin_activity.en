'''Plasma renin activity''' ('''PRA'''), also known as the '''renin (active) assay''' or '''random plasma renin''', is a measure of the activity of the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[enzyme]] [[renin]], which plays a major role in the body's [[regulation of blood pressure]], thirst, and urine output. PRA is sometimes measured, specially in case of certain diseases which present with [[Hypertension#Role_of_renin|hypertension]] or [[hypotension]]. PRA is also raised in certain tumors.<ref>Hamilton Regional Laboratory Medicine Program - Laboratory Reference Centre Manual. Renin Direct.</ref> A PRA measurement may be compared to a plasma [[aldosterone]] concentration as an [[aldosterone-to-renin ratio]].

==Measurement and Values==
Measurement is done from a sample of venous blood using immunological measuring mechanisms like [[ELISA]], [[Radioimmunoassay|RIA]], etc. Often these are done by automated machines to minimize human error.

===Considerations for variation===

These values are quite variable in a normal person. Variation occur with the following:

*   Salt intake
*   [[Pregnancy]]
*   Time of the day
*   Body position (sitting, lying down)
*   State of water intake and dehydration
*   Use of anti-hypertensive drugs, estrogen-containing forms of [[hormonal contraception]], anti-anginals drugs, etc. (basically, most drugs that are active on the [[heart]], [[blood vessels]] and/or the [[kidneys]].
*   Certain diseases of the heart, kidneys, etc.

===Normal values===
[[Reference ranges for blood tests]] of plasma renin activity can be given both in mass and in international units (μIU/mL or equivalently mIU/L, improperly shown as μU/mL or U/L, confusing mcU/mL used where Greek μ not available), with the former being roughly convertible to the latter by multiplying with 11.2.<ref name=washington>[http://depts.washington.edu/labweb/referencelab/print/endo.pdf New Assays for Aldosterone, Renin and Parathyroid Hormone] University of
Washington, Department of Laboratory Medicine. Retrieved Mars 2011</ref> The following table gives the lower limit (2.5th percentile) and upper limit (97.5th percentile) for plasma renin activity by mass and MCU, with different values owing to various factors of variability of [[reference ranges]]:
