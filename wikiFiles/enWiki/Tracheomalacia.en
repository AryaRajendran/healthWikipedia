'''Tracheomalacia''' (from ''trachea'' and the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] μαλακία, ''softening'') is a condition characterized by flaccidity of the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]l support [[cartilage]] which leads to tracheal collapse especially when increased airflow is demanded.

The trachea normally dilates slightly during [[Inhalation|inspiration]] and narrows slightly during [[exhalation|expiration]]. These processes are exaggerated in tracheomalacia, leading to airway collapse on expiration. The usual symptom of tracheomalacia is expiratory [[stridor]] or laryngeal crow.

If the condition extends further to the bronchi (if there is also [[bronchomalacia]]), it is termed [[tracheobronchomalacia]]. The same condition can also affect the [[larynx]], which is called [[laryngomalacia]].

==Classification==
There are three types:<ref name="pmid12535032">{{cite journal |author=Austin J, Ali T |title=Tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia in children: pathophysiology, assessment, treatment and anaesthesia management |journal=Paediatr Anaesth |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=3–11 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12535032 |doi= 10.1046/j.1460-9592.2003.00802.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1155-5645&date=2003&volume=13&issue=1&spage=3}}</ref>
*Type 1 &mdash; [[congenital]], sometimes associated with [[tracheoesophageal fistula]] or [[esophageal atresia]]
*Type 2 &mdash; extrinsic compression sometimes due to [[vascular ring]]s
*Type 3 &mdash; acquired due to [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] infection or prolonged [[intubation]] or inflammatory conditions like relapsing [[polychondritis]]

==Treatment==
If the symptoms are severe enough, treatment may be needed. These range from medical management over [[mechanical ventilation]] (both [[continuous positive airway pressure]], CPAP, or [[bi-level positive airway pressure]], BiPAP) to [[tracheal stenting]] and [[surgery]].

Surgical techniques include [[aortopexy]], [[tracheopexy]], [[tracheobronchoplasty]], and [[tracheostomy]].<ref name="pmid17356936">{{cite journal |author=van der Zee DC, Bax NM |title=Thoracoscopic tracheoaortopexia for the treatment of life-threatening events in tracheomalacia |journal=Surgical endoscopy |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2024–2025 |year=2007 |pmid=17356936 |doi=10.1007/s00464-007-9250-8}}</ref> None of these techniques has been shown to be more effective than the other.<ref name="pmid16235399">{{cite journal |author=Masters IB, Chang AB |title=Interventions for primary (intrinsic) tracheomalacia in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD005304 |year=2005 |pmid=16235399 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub2 |editor1-last=Masters |editor1-first=I Brent}}</ref>
