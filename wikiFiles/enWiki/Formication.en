'''Formication''' is the medical term for a sensation that resembles that of [[insect]]s crawling (tactile hallucination) on (or under) the skin. It is one specific form of a set of sensations known as [[paresthesia]], which also include the more common prickling, tingling sensation of "pins and needles". Formication is a well documented symptom that has numerous possible causes.

The experience of formication may sometimes cause feelings of [[itchiness]], tingling, pins and needles, burning, or even pain. When it is perceived as itchiness, it may trigger the [[scratch reflex]] and because of this, some people who are suffering from the sensation are at risk of causing skin damage through excessive scratching. More rarely, susceptible individuals who fixate on the sensation may develop [[delusional parasitosis]], becoming convinced that this sensation is being caused by actual insects, despite repeated reassurances from physicians, [[pest control]] experts, and [[entomologist]]s.<ref name=Hinkle>{{cite journal |last=Hinkle |first=Nancy C |title=Delusory Parasitosis |journal=American Entomologist |volume=46 |pages=17–25 |year=2000 |url=http://www.ent.uga.edu/pubs/delusory.pdf |format=PDF | issue=1}}</ref>

The term is derived from ''formica'', the Latin word for [[ant]].

==Differential diagnosis==
Causes of formication include normal states such as onset of [[menopause]] (i.e. hormone withdrawal). Other causes are medical conditions such as [[pesticide|pesticide exposure]],<ref>Vijverberg, H.P., van den Bercken, J. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. (1990) Neurotoxicological effects and the mode of action of pyrethroid insecticides.</ref> [[mercury poisoning]], [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[skin cancer]], [[syphilis]], [[Lyme disease]] or [[herpes zoster]].<ref name=Hinkle/> 

Formication can also sometimes be experienced during high [[fever]]s. Itching, tingling and formication often occur when surfacing from a dive or during ascent to altitude ([[decompression sickness]] or "the bends"). 

It can be a side effect of [[Ritalin]] ([[methylphenidate]]), [[Adderall]] (dextro/levo-amphetamine) and [[Lunesta]] (eszopiclone) and other [[prescription drug]]s or of [[cocaine]] or [[amphetamine]]s. (Accordingly, it goes by the [[slang]] term "coke bugs".) Formication can also be a [[withdrawal symptoms|withdrawal symptom]] of weaning oneself off cocaine, opioids, or amphetamine. It can also accompany [[alcohol withdrawal]] in [[alcoholic]]s, along with [[delirium tremens]], and can often be accompanied by visual hallucinations of insects.<ref name=Hinkle/>

==History==
Formication is etymologically derived from the [[Latin]] word ''formica'', meaning "[[ant]]", precisely because of this similarity in sensation to that of crawling insects. The term has been in use for several hundred years.  In the 1797 edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], a description of the condition [[wikt:raphania|raphania]] includes the symptom:

{{quote|...a formication, or sensation as of ants or other small insects creeping on the parts.|<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=fIJMAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA260&dq=formication Encyclopædia Britannica], 1797, page 260</ref>}}

Described again in an instructional text from 1890:
<blockquote>
A variety of itching, often encountered in the eczema of elderly people, is formication; this is described as exactly like the crawling of myriads of animals over the skin. It is probably due to the successive irritation of nerve fibrils in the skin. At times patients who suffer from it will scarcely be persuaded that it is not due to insects. Yielding to the temptation to scratch invariably makes the disease worse.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=EeJnxmKxH0gC William Allan Jamieson, ''Diseases of the Skin: A Manual for Practitioners and Students'', 1890]</ref>
