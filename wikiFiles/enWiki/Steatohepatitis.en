'''Steatohepatitis''' (also known as '''fatty liver disease''') is a type of [[liver disease]], characterized by [[inflammation]] of the [[liver]] with concurrent [[fat]] accumulation in liver ("steato", meaning fat, "[[hepatitis]]", meaning inflammation of the liver). Mere deposition of fat in the liver is termed [[steatosis]], and together these constitute [[fatty liver]] changes. 

Classically seen in [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]]s as part of [[alcoholic liver disease]], steatohepatitis also is frequently found in people with [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]] and it is related to [[metabolic syndrome]]. When not associated with excessive [[alcohol]] intake, it is referred to as '''nonalcoholic steatohepatitis''', or '''NASH''' and is the progressive form of the relatively benign [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]].<ref name="pmid19065650">{{cite journal |author=Vuppalanchi R, Chalasani N |title=Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Selected practical issues in their evaluation and management |journal=Hepatology |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=306–17 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19065650 |pmc=2766096 |doi=10.1002/hep.22603 |url=}}</ref> Steatohepatitis of either [[etiology]] may progress to [[cirrhosis]], and NASH is now believed to be a frequent cause of unexplained cirrhosis (at least in Western societies). NASH is also associated with [[lysosomal acid lipase deficiency]].

==Pathophysiology==
Steatohepatitis is characterized microscopically by hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis), mixed lobular inflammation, [[ballooning degeneration]] of [[hepatocyte]]s (sometimes with identifiable [[Mallory bodies]]), [[glycogen]]ated hepatocyte nuclei, and pericellular [[fibrosis]]. The "chicken wire" pattern of the pericellular fibrosis, which affects portal areas only secondarily in later stages, is very characteristic and is identified on [[trichrome stain]]s.

==Treatment==
Recent studies suggest [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]], and [[anti-diabetic drug|antiglycemic drug]]s may alter the course of the disease. A [[randomized controlled trial]] found, "[[pioglitazone]] led to metabolic and histologic improvement in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis".<ref name="pmid17135584">{{cite journal |author=Belfort R, Harrison SA, Brown K, ''et al.'' |title=A placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis |journal=N.

As of 2007, no treatment has yet emerged as the "gold standard". General recommendations include improving metabolic risk factors and reducing alcohol intake.<ref name=Adams>{{cite journal|author=Adams LA, Angulo P|title=Treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease|journal=Postgrad Med J|year=2006|volume=82|pages=315–22|pmid=16679470|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.042200| url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/82/967/315|issue=967|pmc=2563793}}</ref> However, vitamin E can improve some symptoms of NASH and was superior to insulin sensitizer in one large study. In the Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial, for patients with NASH but without diabetes mellitus, the use of very high dosages of vitamin E (800 IU/day) for four years was associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement than placebo (43% vs. 19%) in the primary outcome. The primary outcome was an improvement in certain histological features as measured by biopsy, but it did not improve fibrosis. Pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, improved some features of NASH, but not the primary outcome, and resulted in a significant weight gain (mean 4.7 kilograms) which persisted after pioglitazone was discontinued.<ref name="Sanyal">{{cite journal |author=Sanyal AJ, Chalasani N, Kowdley KV, ''et al.'' |title=Pioglitazone, vitamin E, or placebo for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis |journal=N.

==Prognosis==
A retrospective [[cohort study]] concluded, "liver failure is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in NASH-associated cirrhosis. The prognosis is either similar or less severe than HCV-cirrhosis."<ref name="pmid12883486">{{cite journal |author=Hui JM, Kench JG, Chitturi S, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term outcomes of cirrhosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis compared with hepatitis C |journal=Hepatology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=420–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12883486 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2003.50320}}</ref>

==History==
NASH was first described in 1980 in a series of patients of the [[Mayo Clinic]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ludwig J, Viggiano TR, McGill DB, Oh BJ|title=Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Mayo Clinic experiences with a hitherto unnamed disease|journal=Mayo Clin Proc|year=1980|volume=55|pmid=7382552|pages=434–438|issue=7}}</ref> Its relevance and high prevalence were recognized mainly in the 1990s.
