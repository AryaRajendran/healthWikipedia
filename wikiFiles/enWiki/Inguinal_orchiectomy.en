'''Inguinal orchiectomy''' (also spelled '''orchidectomy''') is a [[surgery|surgical procedure]] to remove a [[testicle]] and the full [[spermatic cord]] through an incision in the lower lateral [[abdomen]] (the "inguinal region").  Orchiectomy is one form of [[castration]]. The procedure is generally performed by a [[urologist]], typically if [[testicular cancer]] is suspected. Often it is performed as same-day surgery, with the patient returning home within hours of the procedure. Some patients elect to have a prosthetic testicle inserted into their [[scrotum]].

A 4â€“6&nbsp;cm incision is made above the [[pubic bone]] on the side corresponding to the testicle to be removed.  This incision runs obliquely midway between the [[pubic tubercle]] and the [[anterior superior iliac spine]].  The incision is extended down through the fat until the [[Abdominal external oblique muscle|external oblique]] [[deep fascia|fascia]] is encountered.  It is incised along its fibres and the spermatic cord is identified and isolated.  From there, the testicle is pulled into the field through the [[inguinal canal]].  The [[spermatic cord]] is clamped off in two places and cut between the clamps.  Long permanent sutures, usually silk or [[polypropylene]], are left on the stump of the spermatic cord as a marker in case it needs to be removed in the future during a [[retroperitoneal lymph node dissection]] (RPLND).

The inguinal orchiectomy is a necessary procedure if [[testicular cancer]] is suspected.  While it is possible to remove a testicle through an incision in the scrotum, this is not done when cancer is suspected because it disrupts the natural [[lymphatic system|lymphatic drainage patterns]].  Testicular cancer usually spreads into the lymph nodes inside the abdomen in a predictable manner.  Cutting the skin in the scrotum may disrupt this and cancer may spread to the [[inguinal lymph node]]s, making surveillance and subsequent operations more difficult.

Complications from this procedure include the usual bleeding and infection. The [[ilioinguinal nerve]] which runs anterior to the spermatic cord may be damaged during the operation and cause numbness over the inner thigh or chronic groin and scrotal pain.

If the orchiectomy is performed to diagnose cancer, the testicle and spermatic cord are then sent to a [[pathologist]] to determine the makeup of the [[tumor]], and the extent of spread within the testicle and cord.
The pathology report, along with pre-surgical imaging studies and [[tumor marker]]s, will determine the course of treatment.
