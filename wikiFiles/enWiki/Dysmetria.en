'''Dysmetria''' ({{lang-en|difficult to measure}}) refers to a lack of coordination of movement typified by the undershoot or overshoot of intended position with the hand, arm, leg, or eye. It is a type of [[ataxia]]. It is sometimes described as an inability to judge distance or scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dysmetria |title=dysmetria - definition of dysmetria in the Medical dictionary - by the Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

'''[[Hypermetria]]''' and '''[[hypometria]]''' refer, respectively, to overshooting and undershooting the intended position.<ref name="Schmahmann, 2007">{{cite journal |author=Schmahmann JD, Weilburg JB, Sherman JC |title=The neuropsychiatry of the cerebellum - insights from the clinic |journal=Cerebellum |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=254–67 |year=2007 |pmid=17786822 |doi=10.1080/14734220701490995 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Manto M |title=Mechanisms of human cerebellar dysmetria: experimental evidence and current conceptual bases |journal=J Neuroeng Rehabil |volume=6 |issue= |pages=10 |year=2009 |pmid=19364396 |pmc=2679756 |doi=10.1186/1743-0003-6-10 |url=}}</ref>

==Overview==
The [[cerebellum]] is the area of the brain that contributes to coordination and motor processes and is anatomically inferior to the [[cerebrum]].<ref name="Trillenberg, 2007">{{cite journal |author=Trillenberg P, Sprenger A, Petersen D, Kömpf D, Heide W, Helmchen C |title=Functional dissociation of saccade and hand reaching control with bilateral lesions of the medial wall of the intraparietal sulcus: implications for optic ataxia |journal=Neuroimage |volume=36 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=T69–76 |year=2007 |pmid=17499172 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.03.038 |url=}}</ref><ref name="Townsend, 1999">{{cite journal |author=Townsend J, Courchesne E, Covington J, ''et al.'' |title=Spatial attention deficits in patients with acquired or developmental cerebellar abnormality |journal=J.

===Motor===
Motor dysmetria is the customary term used when a person refers to dysmetria. Dysmetria of the extremities caused by hemispheric syndromes is manifested in multiple ways: [[dysrhythmic]] tapping of hands and feet and [[Dysdiadochokinesia|dysdiadochokinesis]], which is the impairment of alternating movements.<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/> Damage to the cerebellum makes a person slow to orient their extremities in space.<ref name="Townsend, 1999"/>

'''Motor Control as a Learning Process'''

Recent research has also shed light upon a specific process that if interrupted, may be the cause of [[ataxia]] and dysmetria. According to sources cited in this article, [[motor control]] is a learning process that occurs in the [[synapse]]s of [[Purkinje cell|Purkinje]] [[dendrite]]s.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006">{{cite journal |author=Vahdat S, Maghsoudi A, Haji Hasani M, Towhidkhah F, Gharibzadeh S, Jahed M |title=Adjustable primitive pattern generator: a novel cerebellar model for reaching movements |journal=Neurosci. Lett. |volume=406 |issue=3 |pages=232–4 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16930835 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2006.07.038 |url=}}</ref> There have been varying theories as to the makeup of the cerebellum, which controls this process. Some predicted that the cerebellum was an array of adjustable pattern generators (APGs), each of which generate a “burst command” with varying intensity and duration. Other models, which apply mostly in [[robotic]] applications, propose that the cerebellum acquires an “inverse model of the motor apparatus".<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>  More recent research in [[electrophysiology]] has shown modular structures in the [[spinal cord]] known as “motor primitives".<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>
Based on the APG model, modules of APG are the features that control [[motor learning]].<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> The entire process is a [[positive feedback loop]]. Inhibitory input is transmitted and received from various components of the [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]], including the [[cerebellar nucleus]], a motor cortical cell and [[Purkinje cell]]s.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> Purkinje cells send the inhibitive information by obtaining learning information from parallel fibers of [[granule cells]]. This model of APGs is useful in that it effectively describes the motor learning process.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>

Motor primitives are another proposed module of motor learning.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> This information was found by electrical stimulation of the [[lumbar spinal cord]] in rats and frogs.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> Upon the stimulation, researchers found that motor primitives are found in the [[spinal cord]] and use patterns of [[muscle]] activation to generate a specific motor output. Different movements are learned from different levels of activation. These findings led researchers to believe that these same motor primitives could be found in the cerebellum.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>

These two different models combined show that it is possible that motor primitives are in the cerebellum, because, “a set of parallel arrays of APG can drive each motor primitive module in the spinal cord."<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> The authors have generated a model of adjustable primitive pattern generator (APPG), which is basically a group of parallel APGs summed together.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>

The APPG model is a vector sum of all the inputs of the APG, which are units of position, velocity and time.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> [[Granule cells]] send information from the spinal cord and the [[motor cortex]] which in turn translates the information in a process called state mapping.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> The final model of the APPG becomes linear upon the vector summation of the information from the [[neurons]] and muscles.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>  This model is consistent with the “virtual trajectory hypothesis” which states that the desired trajectory is sent to the spinal cord as a motor command.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>

===Saccadic===
[[Saccades]] are the very quick, simultaneous movements made by the eye to receive visual information and shift the line of vision from one position to another.<ref name="Iwamoto, 2002">{{cite journal |author=Iwamoto Y, Yoshida K |title=Saccadic dysmetria following inactivation of the primate fastigial oculomotor region |journal=Neurosci. Lett. |volume=325 |issue=3 |pages=211–5 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12044658 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(02)00268-9 |url=}}</ref> A person depends profoundly on the ability of the accuracy of these movements.<ref name="Iwamoto, 2002"/>  The area of the brain that controls saccades is the [[superior colliculus]], specifically the [[fastigial]] [[oculomotor]] region (FOR).<ref name="Iwamoto, 2002"/> The information is received from the retina, is translated into spatial information and is then transferred to motor centers for motor response. A person with saccadic dysmetria will constantly produce abnormal eye movements including microsaccades, ocular flutter, and square wave jerks even when the eye is at rest<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/> . During eye movements hypometric and [[hypermetric]] saccades will occur and interruption and slowing of normal saccadic movement is common.<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/>

==Causes==
The actual cause of dysmetria is thought to be caused by lesions in the cerebellum or by lesions in the proprioceptive nerves that lead to the cerebellum that coordinate visual, spatial and other sensory information with motor control.<ref name="Townsend, 1999"/> Damage to the [[proprioceptive]] nerves does not allow the cerebellum to accurately judge where the hand, arm, leg, or eye should move. These lesions are often caused by [[stroke]]s, [[Multiple Sclerosis |Multiple Sclerosis (MS)]], [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis |  Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)]], or [[tumors]]. 

According to the research article cited above, motor control is a learning process that utilizes APPGs.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/> Disruption of APPGs is possibly the cause of ataxia and dysmetria and upon identification of the motor primitives, clinicians may be able to isolate the specific areas responsible for the cerebellar problems.<ref name="Vahdat, 2006"/>

There are two types of cerebellar disorders that produce dysmetria, specifically midline cerebellar syndromes and hemispheric cerebellar syndromes.  Midline cerebellar syndromes can cause [[ocular dysmetria]], which is a condition in which the pupils of the eye overshoot. Ocular dysmetria makes it difficult to focus vision onto one object. Hemispheric cerebellar syndromes cause dysmetria in the typical motor sense that many think of when hearing the term dysmetria.

A common motor syndrome that causes dysmetria is cerebellar motor syndrome, which also marked by impairments in [[gait]] (also known as [[ataxia]]), disordered eye movements, [[tremor]], difficulty [[swallowing]] and poor [[Manner of articulation|articulation]].<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/> As stated above, cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) also causes dysmetria.

==Associated diseases==
Dysmetria is often found in individuals with [[Multiple Sclerosis | Multiple Sclerosis (MS)]], [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)]], and persons who have suffered from [[tumors]] or [[strokes]]. Persons who have been diagnosed with [[autosomal]] dominant [[spinocerebellar ataxia]] (SCAs) also exhibit dysmetria.<ref name="Manto, 2005">{{cite journal |author=Manto MU |title=The wide spectrum of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) |journal=Cerebellum |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=2–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15895552 |doi=10.1080/14734220510007914 |url=}}</ref> There are many types of SCAs and though many exhibit similar symptoms (one being dysmetria), they are considered to be heterogeneous.<ref name="Manto, 2005"/> Freidrich’s ataxia is a well-known SCA in which children have dysmetria.<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/> Cerebellar malformations extending to the [[brainstem]] can also present with dysmetria.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mario Manto |title=Cerebellar Disorders: A Practical Approach to Diagnosis and Management |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-521-87813-6 |oclc=456170457 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of any cerebellar disorder or syndrome should be made by a qualified [[neurologist]]. Prior to referring a patient to a neurologist, a general practitioner or MS nurse will perform a finger-to-nose test.<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/> The clinician will raise a finger in front of the patient and ask him to touch it with his finger and then touch his nose with his forefinger several times. This shows a patient’s ability to judge the position of a target. Other tests that could be performed are similar in nature and include a heel to shin test in which [[proximal]] overshoot characterizes dysmetria and an inability to draw an imaginary circle with the arms or legs without any decomposition of movement.<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/> After a positive result in the finger-to-nose test, a neurologist will do a [[magnetic resonance image]] (MRI) to determine any damage to the cerebellum.<ref name="Schmahmann, 2004"/>

==Treatments==
Currently there is no cure for dysmetria itself as it is actually a symptom of an underlying disorder. However, [[Isoniazid]] and [[Clonazepam]] have been used to treat dysmetria. There have also been numerous reported cases of [[Chiropractic Neurology]] as an effective holistic treatment for dysmetria. [[Cannabis]] has been used in trials in the U.K. and displayed some success{{Citation Needed|date=February 2013}}, though it is not legal to use in the U.S. at this time.

===Research===
Researchers now are testing different possibilities for treating dysmetria and [[ataxia]]. One opportunity for treatment is called rehearsal by eye movement.<ref name="Crowdy, 2002">{{cite journal |author=Crowdy KA, Kaur-Mann D, Cooper HL, Mansfield AG, Offord JL, Marple-Horvat DE |title=Rehearsal by eye movement improves visuomotor performance in cerebellar patients |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=244–7 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12195526 |doi=10.1007/s00221-002-1171-0 |url=}}</ref> It is believed that visually guided movements require both lower- and higher-order visual functioning by first identifying a target location and then moving to acquire what is sought after.<ref name="Manto, 2005"/> In one study, researchers used visually guided stepping which is parallel to visually guided arm movements to test this treatment.<ref name="Crowdy, 2002"/>  The patients suffered from saccadic dysmetria which in turn caused them to overshoot their movements 3. The patients first walked normally and were then told to twice review the area that was to be walked through 3. After rehearsal with eye movements, the patients improved their motor performance.<ref name="Crowdy, 2002"/>  Researchers believe that prior rehearsal with the eyes might be enough for a patient that suffers from motor dysmetria as a result of saccadic dysmetria to complete a motor task with enhanced [[spatial awareness]].<ref name="Crowdy, 2002"/>

Research has also been done for those patients that suffer from Multiple Sclerosis (MS).<ref name="Hooper, 2002">{{cite journal |author=Hooper J, Taylor R, Pentland B, Whittle IR |title=A prospective study of thalamic deep brain stimulation for the treatment of movement disorders in multiple sclerosis |journal=Br J Neurosurg |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=102–9 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=12046727 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains a viable possibility for some MS patients though the long term effects of this treatment are currently under review.<ref name="Hooper, 2002"/> The subjects that have undergone this treatment had had no major relapse for 6 months and disabling motor function problems.<ref name="Hooper, 2002"/> Most subjects benefited from the implantation of the [[electrodes]] and some reported that their movement disorder was gone after surgery.<ref name="Hooper, 2002"/> However, these results are limiting at this time because of the small range of subjects that were used for the experiment and it is unknown whether this is a viable option for all MS patients that suffer from motor control problems.<ref name="Hooper, 2002"/>
