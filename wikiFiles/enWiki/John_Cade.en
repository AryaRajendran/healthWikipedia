Dr '''John Frederick Joseph Cade''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] (18 January 1912 – 16 November 1980) was an Australian [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] credited with discovering (in 1948) the effects of [[lithium carbonate]] as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]] (then known as manic depression). In an age where the standard treatments for psychosis were [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[lobotomy]], lithium had the distinction of being the first effective medication available to treat a mental illness.

==Early life==
John Cade was born in [[Murtoa, Victoria|Murtoa]],<ref group="nb">Some authors state Cade was born in Horsham, one of the larger towns in the Wimmera area.  However other authors, notably Cade's son Jack Cade, state John Cade was born in [[Murtoa]], a town {{convert|32|km|mi|0}} NE of Horsham.</ref> in the [[Wimmera]] region of [[Victoria, Australia]].  John's father David was Murtoa's general practitioner.  Ellen, John's mother, and younger brothers David and Frank completed the family.  When John was a small boy, his father left for World War I and served in [[Gallipoli]] and [[Western Front (World War I)|France]].  On return from the war, his father suffered from 'war weariness' and had difficulty in continuing in general practice.  Therefore, his father sold the practice and accepted a position with the Mental Hygiene Department.  Over the next 25 years, Dr Cade Sr became medical superintendent at several Victorian mental hospitals, namely [[Sunbury Asylum|Sunbury]], [[Beechworth Asylum|Beechworth]] and [[Mont Park Asylum|Mont Park]].  John and his brothers spent many of their younger years living within the grounds of these institutions, which had a great bearing on John's later deep understanding of the needs of the mentally ill.<ref name="jack">{{cite journal

He then studied medicine at the [[University of Melbourne]], graduating at the age of 21 years with honours in all subjects.   He became a House Officer at [[St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne|St Vincent's Hospital]] and then [[Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne|Royal Children's Hospital]] before becoming severely ill with bilateral [[pneumococcal pneumonia]].  While he was convalescing, John fell in love with one of his nurses, Jean.  They married in 1937.<ref name="jack"/>

===World War II===
Like his father before him, Cade left his young family to fight for Australia in the Armed Forces in World War II. Cade was appointed [[Captain (land)|captain]], [[Australian Army Medical Corps]], [[Second Australian Imperial Force|A.I.F.]], on 1 July 1940 and posted to the 2nd/9th Field Ambulance.<ref name=adb/> Although trained as a psychiatrist, Dr. Cade served as a [[surgery|surgeon]] and departed for Singapore in 1941 on [[RMS Queen Mary]].  He was promoted to [[major]] in September 1941.  After the [[Battle of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] to Japan, he became a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Changi Prison]] from February 1942 to September 1945.<ref name="jack"/> During his imprisonment, he reportedly would observe some fellow inmates having strange, vacillating behaviour. He thought perhaps a toxin was affecting their brains and when it was eliminated through their urine, they lost their symptoms.

== Discovery of the effect of lithium on mania ==
After the war, Cade recuperated very briefly in Heidelberg Hospital, then took up a position at Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital in Melbourne. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments which led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. These experiments mostly consisted of injecting urine from mentally ill patients into the abdomen of [[guinea pig]]s. These would appear to die faster than when healthy persons' urine was used, leading him to think that perhaps more uric acid was present in the samples provided by his mentally ill patients. Then, in an effort to increase the water solubility of uric acid, lithium urate was added to the solution.  Cade found that in the guinea pigs injected with the lithium urate solution, toxicity was greatly reduced.<ref name="mja">{{cite journal

After ingesting lithium himself to ensure its safety in humans,<ref name=jack/> Cade began a small-scale trial of lithium citrate and/or lithium carbonate on some of his patients diagnosed with [[mania]], [[schizophrenia|dementia præcox]] or [[melancholia]], with outstanding results.  The calming effect was so robust that Cade speculated that mania was caused by a deficiency in lithium.<ref name=mja/>

While Cade's results appeared highly promising, side-effects of lithium in some cases lead to non-compliance.  Toxicity of lithium led to several deaths of patients undergoing lithium treatment. The problem of toxicity was greatly reduced when suitable tests were developed to measure the lithium level in the blood.  Moreover, as a naturally-occurring chemical, lithium salt could not be [[patent]]ed, meaning that its manufacturing and sales were not considered commercially viable. These factors prevented its widespread adoption in psychiatry for some years, particularly in the United States, where its use was banned until 1970.

==John Cade, Royal Park and RANZCP==
[[Image:Royalparkjohncadeunit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|John Cade acute unit at [[Royal Park Hospital]] circa 2003]]
In 1952 Cade was appointed Superintendent and Dean of the clinical school at [[Royal Park Hospital]]. Two years later, at the request of the Mental Hygiene Authority which was planning to remodel [[Royal Park Hospital|Royal Park]], he visited Britain for six months to inspect psychiatric institutions. On his return, he introduced modern facilities and replaced the rather authoritarian approach to patient care with a lot more personal and informal style that included [[group therapy]]. Concerned at the number of alcohol-related cases, he supported [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] admission to aid early detection and later proposed the use of large doses of [[thiamine]] in the treatment of alcoholism.<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

He served as the federal president of the [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists]] in 1969–70, and also as the president for its [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] branch from 1963 until his death in 1980. In the end, Dr. Cade's discovery did receive widespread acknowledgements and praise. For his contribution to psychiatry, he was awarded a Kittay International Award in 1974 (with [[Mogens Schou]] from Denmark), and he was invited to be a Distinguished Fellow of the [[American College of Psychiatrists]].  In 1976, Cade was one of the first to be made an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]].<ref>{{cite web

Finally, in July 2004, the Medical Journal of Australia reported that Cade's 1949 article, "Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement", was the number one most cited MJA article.<ref>{{cite web

==Troubled Minds==
In 2004, [[Film Australia]] and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] screened the documentary 'Troubled Minds – The Lithium Revolution',<ref>{{IMDb title|1201166|Troubled Minds: The Lithium Revolution }}</ref> a 60 minute documentary portraying John Cade's discovery of the use of Lithium in mental illness.  The documentary received international recognition winning the main prize at the International Vega Awards for Excellence in Scientific Broadcasting.
Troubled Minds was also recognised locally with writer/director Dennis K. Smith winning the AWGIE Award for Best Documentary.<ref>{{cite web
