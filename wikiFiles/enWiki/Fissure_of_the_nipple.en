'''Fissure of the nipple''', also known as '''jogger's nipple''', is a condition that can be caused by friction that can result in soreness, dryness or irritation to, or bleeding of, one or both [[nipple]]s during and/or following running or other physical exercise. This condition is also experienced by women who [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]]<ref name="breastfeed">{{cite web |title=Fissures of the nipple |author=Dr. C.H. Asrani |url=http://www.growingwell.com/motherscorner/bfproblems1.htm |publisher=GrowingWell.com |work=Common Problems  in the first weeks of Breast Feeding |accessdate=10 February 2011}}</ref> and by [[surfers]] who do not wear [[rash guard]]s.

==Cause==
Jogger's nipple is caused by friction from the repeated rubbing of a t-shirt or other upper body clothing against the nipples during a prolonged period of exercise.

The condition is suffered mainly by runners. Long-distance runners are especially prone, because they are exposed to the friction on the nipple for the greatest period of time. However, it is not only suffered by athletes; the inside of a badge, a logo on normal items of clothing, or breastfeeding<ref name="breastfeed" /> can also cause the friction which results in this condition.

==Prevention==

The condition is easily preventable and treatable. Viable methods include:
* Run shirtless whenever the law permits.
* Don't use a large, loose-fitting T-shirt during exercise.
* Wear shirts made of synthetic fabrics instead of cotton.
* Apply a waterproof adhesive bandage, or surgical tape over each nipple before exercise to act as a barrier between skin and cloth.
* Apply an anti-chafing balm or petroleum jelly prior to exercise.
* Use specialized products available to prevent the condition such as [[rash guard]]s.
* Wear a sports bra, shimmel, compression vest, or some variety of chest binding clothing.

==Treatment==
* Apply an antiseptic cream as soon as you suspect a fissure, to reduce the chances of bacterial infection that would make the condition worse.<ref name="breastfeed" />
* If the skin is already damaged, applying petroleum jelly can prevent healing if used over a period of time. 
* A "liquid bandage" can be helpful for healing or prevention, although it may sting initially. 
* Use a nipple shield (of rubber, or glass and rubber) temporarily.<ref name="breastfeed" />

This condition should clear within a few days. If not, medical attention is warranted. Other skin conditions such as [[eczema]], [[psoriasis]], [[impetigo]], [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]s or an [[allergic reaction]] can cause nipple pain and changes in the appearance of the skin. In women, breastfeeding (often complicated by [[Candidiasis|thrush]] infection),<ref name="breastfeed" /> hormonal changes in early [[pregnancy]] or during [[menstruation]], as well as certain types of [[breast cancer]], i.e. [[Paget's disease of the breast]], can also cause nipple soreness and pain.

== Other names ==
Jogger's nipple is also known as runner's nipple, surfer's nipple, red eleven, raver's nipple, big Q's, red nipple, stingers, weightlifter's nipple and gardener's nipple, or nipple chafe. There are similar colloquial terms for almost any activity that can result in the condition.
