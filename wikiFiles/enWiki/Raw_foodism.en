'''Raw foodism''' (or '''rawism''') is a [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] consisting of [[cooking|uncooked]], [[processed food|unprocessed]], and often [[organic foods]] or wild foods.

Depending on the type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a selection of raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds (including [[Sprouting|sprouted]] [[whole grains]] such as [[gaba rice]]), eggs, fish (such as [[sashimi]]), meat (such as [[carpaccio]]), and non-[[Pasteurization|pasteurized]]/non-[[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenized]] dairy products (such as [[raw milk]], raw milk cheese, and raw milk yogurt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altmedicine.about.com/od/popularhealthdiets/a/Raw_Food.htm |title=Raw Food Diet|first=Cathy |last=Wong |publisher=[[About.com]] |date=17 September 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref>

==Varieties of raw foodism==
[[File:Raw Vegan Meatless Thanks-Giving Turkey.jpg|thumb|Raw Vegan "Thanks-Giving Turkey"]]
Raw foodism can include any diet of primarily unheated food, or food cooked to a temperature less than {{convert|40|°C|°F|lk=on}} to {{convert|46|°C|°F}}. Raw foodists can be divided between those that advocate [[raw veganism]] or [[vegetarianism]], those that advocate a raw [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] diet, and those that advocate a 100% raw carnivorous diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawpaleoforum.com/carnivorous-zero-carb-approach/ |title=Carnivorous / Zero Carb Approach |work=Rawpaleoforum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref>

===Raw veganism===
[[File:Raw Vegan Apple Pie.jpg|thumb|Raw vegan "apple pie"]]
{{Main|Raw veganism}}
A raw vegan diet consists of unprocessed, raw plant foods that have not been heated above {{convert|40|°C|°F|lk=on}}. Raw vegans such as Dr. Brian Clement, Dr. Gabriel Cousens, Thierry Brouwers a.k.a. "Superlight", and Douglas Graham<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodnsport.com/blog/articles/the-challenges-of-going-on-a-raw-food-diet.html |title=The Challenges of Going on a Raw Food Diet |publisher=FoodnSport.com |date=
|accessdate=2011-03-31| first=Douglas | last=Graham}}</ref> believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost much of their nutritional value and are less healthful or even harmful to the body. Advocates argue that raw or living foods have natural enzymes, which are critical in building proteins and rebuilding the body, and that heating these foods kills the natural enzymes and can leave toxins behind. However, critics point out that enzymes, as with other proteins consumed in the diet, are denatured and eventually lysed by the digestive process rendering them non-functional. Typical foods included in raw food diets are fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and sprouted grains and legumes.

Among raw vegans there are some subgroups such as [[fruitarianism|fruitarians]], juicearians, or sproutarians. Fruitarians eat primarily or exclusively fruits, berries, seeds, and nuts. Juicearians process their raw plant foods into juice. Sproutarians adhere to a diet consisting mainly of [[edible sprouts|sprouted seeds]].

===Raw vegetarianism===
Vegetarianism is a diet that excludes meat (including game and byproducts like gelatin), fish (including shellfish and other sea animals) and poultry, but allows dairy and/or eggs. Common foods include fruit, vegetables, sprouts, nuts, seeds, grains, legumes, dairy, eggs and honey. There are several variants of this diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/vegetarian?view=uk |title=AskOxford: vegetarian |publisher=Askoxford.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref>

===Raw animal food diets===
{{Main|Raw animal food diets}}
[[Image:Sashimi.jpg|thumb|right|A sashimi dinner set]]
Included in raw animal food diets are any food that can be eaten raw, such as uncooked, unprocessed raw muscle-meats/organ-meats/eggs, raw dairy, and aged, raw animal foods such as [[century egg]]s, [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] meat/fish/shellfish/[[kefir]], as well as vegetables/fruits/nuts/sprouts/honey, but generally ''not'' raw grains, raw beans, and raw soy.  Raw foods included on such diets have not been heated at temperatures above {{convert|104|°F|°C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodenquirer.com/food-enquirer-channel/articles/vegetarian/primal-dieting-eat-your-raw-diet-with-a-roar-.html |title=Primal Dieting: Eat Your Raw food With A Roar! |work=Foodenquirer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> Raw animal foodists believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost much of their nutritional value and are harmful to the body. They also believe that raw meats should come from sources such as raw, grassfed meats or raw wild game rather than raw grainfed meats.

Examples of raw animal food diets include the Primal Diet,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/31/food/fo-19029 |title=Meat but No Heat - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2001-01-31 |accessdate=2010-05-12 | first=Emily | last=Green}}</ref><ref name="vueweekly1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=7032 |title=Vue Weekly: Edmonton's 100% Independent Weekly: Well met, raw meat: hoorah for raw! |publisher=Vueweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> [[Anopsology]] (otherwise known as "Instinctive Eating" or "Instincto"), and the Raw [[Paleolithic diet]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawpaleodiet.com |title=Raw Paleo Diet - The Raw Paleolithic Diet &amp; Lifestyle! |publisher=Rawpaleodiet.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref><ref name=rvaf>{{cite web|url=http://rawpaleodiet.vpinf.com/rvaf-overview.html |title=Raw Paleo Diet &ndash; RVAF Systems Overview |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> (otherwise known as the "Raw Meat Diet").<ref name="independent1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/the-raw-meat-diet-do-you-have-the-stomach-for-the-latest-celebrity-food-fad-493908.html |title=The raw meat diet: do you have the stomach for the latest celebrity food fad? - Health News, Health & Wellbeing - The Independent |publisher=Independent.co.uk |author=More for less |date= 2005-06-12|accessdate=2008-11-07 | location=London}}</ref>
	
The Primal Diet,<ref name="vueweekly1"/> is a diet consisting of fatty meats, organ meats, dairy, honey, minimal fruit and vegetable juices and coconut cream, all raw. The founder of the Primal Diet is [[Aajonus Vonderplanitz]]. Vonderplanitz has estimated that there are 20,000 followers of his raw-meat-heavy Primal Diet in North America, alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigisland-bigisland.com/big-island-events-the-rainbow-raw-games-a-hawaiian-adventure.html |title=Big Island Events: The Rainbow Raw Games, A Hawaiian Adventure |work=Bigisland-bigisland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> Books by Vonderplanitz include "The Recipe for Living Without Disease"<ref>Carnelian Bay Castle Press, LLC.

==History==
Raw foods as a dietary health treatment was first developed in Switzerland by medical doctor [[Maximilian Bircher-Benner]], inventor of [[muesli]]. After recovering from [[jaundice]] while eating raw apples he conducted experiments into the effects on human health of raw vegetables.
In November 1897, he opened a sanatorium in Zurich called "Vital Force," named after a "key term from the German lifestyle reform movement which states that people should pattern their lives after the logic determined by nature". It is still treating patients today.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.zurich.com/developmentcenter/aboutzurichdevelopmentcenter/locationhistory/biographybircher.htm |date= |title=Biography of Max Bircher-Benner|accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref>

[[Weston Price|Weston A. Price]], in a 1939 work entitled ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', observed dental degeneration in the first generation who abandoned traditional nutrient dense foods which included unprocessed [[raw milk]]. Price claimed that the parents of such first generation children had excellent jaw development and dental health, while their children had malocclusion and tooth decay and attributed this to their new modern insufficient nutrient diet.<ref>Price, Weston A. ''[http://www.journeytoforever.org/farm_library/price/pricetoc.html Nutrition and Physical Degeneration]: A Comparison of Primitive and Modern Diets and Their Effects'' 1939. Paul B. Hoeber, Inc; Medical Book Department of Harper & Brothers.</ref> Price also noted, in his book, that the healthiest tribes he visited all incorporated some raw animal foods in their diets.

Leslie Kenton's book ''Raw Energy - Eat Your Way to Radiant Health'', published in 1984, popularized food such as sprouts, seeds, and fresh vegetable juices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigelberman.co.uk/feature3_jan2002.htm |title=new insight - feature article, Roger McGough interview |publisher=Nigelberman.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> The book brought together research into raw foodism and its support of health.  It cites examples such as the sprouted seed enriched diets of the long lived [[Hunza people]] and [[Max Gerson]]'s use of a raw juice-based diet in conjunction with detoxification methods to cure cancer.<ref>The cure of advanced cancer by diet therapy: a summary of 30 years of clinical experimentation. Physiol Chem Phys 1978;10(5):449-464</ref> The book advocates a diet of 75% raw food to prevent [[degenerative disease]]s, slow the effects of aging, provide enhanced energy, and boost emotional balance.

Other notable proponents from the early part of this century include: [[Ann Wigmore]], [[Herbert Shelton]], and [[Norman W. Walker]] (inventor of the Norwalk Juicing Press).

==Common beliefs==
Beliefs held by raw foodists include:
* Some raw foodists believe that [[Enzymes#Biological function|digestive enzymes]] in raw foods (such as [[amylase]]s, [[protease]]s, and [[lipase]]s) aid digestion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holisticjunction.com/articles/8019.html |title="Digestive Enzymes do More than just Aid Digestion", an article at Holistic Junction |publisher=Holisticjunction.com |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> Heating food above 104-120&nbsp;°Fahrenheit (40-49 °Celsius) degrades or destroys these enzymes in food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag99/apr99-cover.html |title=Life Extension Magazine, April 1999, '&#39;Digestive Enzymes: The Missing Link'&#39; |publisher=Lef.org |date=1999-04-01 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> A few raw foodists such as Dr. Douglas Graham dispute the importance of enzymes in foods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodnsport.com/blog/articles/enzymes-are-they-for-real.html |title=Enzymes: Are They for Real? |publisher=FoodnSport.com |date= | first=Douglas | last=Graham}}</ref>
* Raw foods include [[bacteria]] and other [[micro-organisms]] that affect the [[immune system]] and [[digestion]] by populating the [[digestive tract]] with beneficial [[gut flora]]. In addition, many raw-foodists, particularly primal-dieters, are believers in the [[hygiene hypothesis]], a concept which promotes the health benefits of exposure to natural, symbiotic bacteria like those found in unpasteurized fermented foods.
* Raw foods are believed to have higher [[nutrient]] values than foods which have been cooked.<ref name="Encyclopedia.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O39-cookinglossofnutrients.html |title=cooking, loss of nutrients - Health Information About cooking, loss of nutrients &#124; Encyclopedia.com: Dictionary Of Food and Nutrition |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref><ref name="Nutritiondata.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritiondata.com/topics/processing |title=Nutritional Effects of Food Processing – NutritionData.com |publisher=Nutritiondata.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref><ref name="jn.nutrition.org">{{Cite journal|first1=Agnes Fay |last1=Morgan |first2=Grace E. |last2=Kern |month=April |year=1934 |title=The Effect of Heat Upon the Biological Value of Meat Protein |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/7/4/367.pdf |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=367–79}}</ref>
* In addition, most raw foodists believe [[processed food]] and [[convenience food]] often contain ''excitotoxins'' (such as [[flavour enhancer|flavor enhancers]]) which can cause [[excitotoxicity]]. Foods with added chemicals, [[Food preservatives|preservatives]], [[Food additive|additives]], [[Food coloring|colouring agents/dyes]] of any kind are frowned upon by most raw-foodists.
* Raw foodists believe that raw foods are the ideal food for human consumption, and the basis of a raw food lifestyle. Irritants or stimulants like coffee, alcohol, and tobacco are not recommended. Also heated fats and proteins like fried oils and roasted nuts are to be avoided on a raw-food diet, as they are deemed by raw foodists to be carcinogenic.
* Wild foods followed by organic whole foods are more nutritious than conventionally domesticated foods or [[food industry|industrially produced foods]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/86972.php |title=Organic Food Is More Nutritious Say EU Researchers |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>

* Raw foods such as fruits and vegetables are high in [[antioxidants]] and raw-foodists believe they can help to stifle signs of aging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://facecreamcentral.com/battle-aging-with-the-raw-diet |title=Battling Aging with the Raw Diet |publisher=Facecreamcentral.com |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> Dr. [[Joel Fuhrman]], author of "Eat To Live", says that uncooked [[cruciferous vegetables]] have the most powerful anti-cancer effects of all foods. He also says that most of the phytonutrients function as antioxidants in the body, meaning they neutralize [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], rendering them harmless and reducing cancer risk. Raw foodists believe that this property found in [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] living foods or raw food, which neutralizes free radicals, makes [[green smoothie]]s a powerful antioxidant drink.
* Because raw seeds and nuts are vulnerable to moldiness and rancidity,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/ScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/MacroanalyticalProceduresManualMPM/ucm084406.htm |title=Macroanalytical Procedures Manual (MPM) - MPM: V-10.

* Raw Foodists believe that air-pollution and smoking are extremely harmful to their health. They also believe that recycled tapwater is harmful, especially fluoridated or chlorinated tapwater.<ref>http://www.rawfoodexplained.com/chemicals-in-our-air/the-deadly-chemicals-in-our-air.html</ref><ref>http://www.rawfoodexplained.com/thanks-for-not-smoking/</ref><ref>http://www.raw-food-diet-magazine.com/clean-safe-healthy-drinking-water.html</ref>

===Food preparation===
[[Image:Légumes 01.jpg|thumb|250px|<center>Vegetables in a market</center>]]

Many foods in raw food diets are simple to prepare, such as fruits, salads, meat, and dairy. Other foods can require considerable advanced planning to prepare for eating. Rice and some other grains, for example, require [[sprouting]] or overnight soaking to become digestible. Many raw foodists believe it is best to soak nuts and seeds before eating them, to activate their [[enzymes]], and deactivate enzyme inhibitors.<ref>Calabrese, Karyn (2011). "Soak Your Nuts: Cleansing With Karyn: Detox Secrets for Inner Healing and Outer Beauty." Healthy Living Publications</ref> The amount of soak time varies for all nuts and seeds.

According to some cookbook authors, preparation of ''gourmet'' raw food recipes usually calls for a [[blender (device)|blender]], [[food processor]], [[juicer]], and [[Food dehydrator|dehydrator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmyrecipes.com/diets/raw_food.php |title=About the Raw Food (Living Foods) Diet |publisher=Allmyrecipes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> Depending on the recipe, some food (such as crackers, breads and cookies) may need to be dehydrated. These processes, which produce foods with the taste and texture of cooked food, are lengthy. Some raw foodists dispense with these recipes, feeling that there is no need to emulate the other non-raw diets or increase sales of kitchen appliances.

[[Freezing]] food is acceptable, even though freezing lowers enzyme activity. This view is only held by some raw-foodists, with many raw-foodists actually viewing freezing as harmful,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawfoodexplained.com/selection-and-storage-of-foods-part-i/does-freezing-harm-foods.html |title=Selection &amp; Storage Of Foods, I - Does Freezing Harm Foods? |publisher=Rawfoodexplained.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawfoodstips.com/rawfoodeating.php |title=Raw Food Eating |publisher=Rawfoodstips.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> though not as unhealthy as cooking.

Several raw food preparation books have been published including:
* ''Raw: The Uncook Book: New Vegetarian Food for Life'' by Juliano Brotman and Erika Lenkert (Regan Books, 1999)
* ''Raw'' by Charlie Trotter, Roxanne Klein, Jason Smith, and Tim Turner (Ten Speed Press, 2003)

* ''RAWvolution: Gourmet Living Cuisine'' by Matt Amsden (William Morrow, 2006)
* ''Transitioning to Living Cuisine'' by René Oswald (2008)
* ''Everyday Raw'' and ''Entertaining in the Raw'' by Matthew Kenney (Gibbs Smith, 2009)

* ''Going Going Gone Raw'' by Chef Be*Live, Douglas van Duyne and Cintia van Duyne (G. Normous, 2012)

===Raw food movement===
Early proponents include [[St. Louis Estes]], [[Edmund Bordeaux Szekely]], [[Johnny Lovewisdom]], [[Ann Wigmore]] and [[Viktoras Kulvinskas]] (co-founders of the Hippocrates Health Institute), [[Arnold Ehret]] (author and advocate of [[fasting]]), Aris Latham (of Sunfired Foods, Inc., known as the godfather of raw food), Arshavir Ter Hovannessian<ref>Raw-eating, or, A new world free from diseases, vices and poisons by Arshavir Ter Hovannessian, Publisher: Tehran [Iran]: A. Ter Hovannessian, 1967.</ref> and [[Norman W. Walker]] (who advocated the consumption of vegetable juices).

Notable contemporary proponents include several chefs, published authors and lecturers, such as Dr. Douglas Graham, Lou Corona, Juliano Brotman, Rene Oswald, John McCabe, Matthew Kenney, [[Tonya Zavasta]], Alissa Cohen, Chef Be*Live, David Wolfe, [[Aris La Tham]], [[Aajonus Vonderplanitz]], [[Sarma Melngailis]] and [[Elijah Joy]].

Celebrity proponents include [[Demi Moore]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[Ben Vereen]] and [[Carol Alt]]. Woody Harrelson has published books on raw food, starred in a raw food film, created a raw food website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawfoodmedia.com |title=Raw Food Media Website |publisher=RFM |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref> and also opened O2, a raw food restaurant and bar. Model and actress Carol Alt includes raw animal products in her diet; she has written several books on her version of the raw diet and lifestyle, her last one The Raw 50 which includes many chefs like Melissa Mango, celebrity Chef Be*Live and more.

==Research==

[[Artturi Virtanen]] showed that enzymes in uncooked foods are released in the mouth when vegetables are chewed. Raw foodists extrapolate from such research the supposition that the enzymes found in living foods interact with other substances, notably the enzymes produced by the body itself, to aid in digestion. Promoters of raw foods, such as the Weston-Price Foundation, support the idea that, since no digestive juices are secreted in the upper stomach, the enzymes in the raw foods last for about 30&nbsp;minutes in the upper stomach before being destroyed in the lower stomach, thus giving them enough time to break down the raw foods, to some extent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realmilk.com/enzyme.html |title=Enzymes by Sally Fallon with Mary G.

One of the problems in researching microorganisms in the digestive system is that many of them can not live outside the digestive system and can only be analysed by their genetic material. Steven R. Gill did some of this analysis and showed that in the "collective genome" of the human intestinal flora there are a high percentage of genes connected with synthesis of some vitamins and essential amino acids.<ref>Steven R.

=== Toxins created by cooking ===

Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking muscle meat creates [[heterocyclic amine]]s (HCAs)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/Database/AWB6411H10264 |title=Analysis of heterocyclic amines in mainstream cigarette smoke using a new NCI GC-MS technique.

While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below {{convert|212|F|lk=on}} creates "negligible amounts" of HCAs. Also, [[microwaving]] meat before cooking may substantially reduce HCAs.<ref name=HCA/>

Cooking also creates certain heat-created toxins, advanced glycation end products, otherwise known as AGEs. This reaction occurs both within the body and external to the body. Many cells in the body (for example endothelial cells, smooth muscle or cells of the immune system) from tissue such as lung, liver, kidney or peripheral blood bear the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) that, when binding AGEs, contributes to age and diabetes-related chronic inflammatory diseases,<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=15249511 |year=2004 |last1=Cai |first1=W |last2=He

Another study has shown that meat heated for 10&nbsp;minutes at {{convert|130|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, showed a 1.5% decrease in protein digestibility.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal|pmid=1897402 |year=1991 |last1=Oste |first1=RE |title=Digestibility of processed food protein |volume=289 |pages=371–88 |journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology}}</ref> Similar heating of [[hake]] meat in the presence of potato starch, soy oil, and salt caused a 6% decrease in amino acid content.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/food.19870311007 |title=Effects of additives and thermal treatment on the content of nitrogen compounds and the nutritive value of hake meat |year=1987 |last1=Seidler |first1=T. |journal=Food / Nahrung |volume=31|issue=10 |pmid=3437919|pages=959–70}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=3437919 |year=1987 |last1=Seidler |first1=T |title=Effects of additives and thermal treatment on the content of nitrogen compounds and the nutritive value of hake meat |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=959–70 |journal=Die Nahrung |doi=10.1002/food.19870311007}}</ref>

One study, comparing the effects of consuming either pasteurized, or homogenized/pasteurized, or unpasteurized milk, showed that pasteurized and homogenized/pasteurized milk might increase allergic reactions in patients allergic to milk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Høst A, Samuelsson EG |title=Allergic reactions to raw, pasteurized, and homogenized/pasteurized cow milk: a comparison.

==Potential harmful effects of cooking==
It has also been pointed out that cooking food, directly or indirectly, requires energy and may thus release gases associated with global warming.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10455948">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10455948 |title=Cooking fires add to global warming |author=Buncombe, Andrew |date=6 August 2007 |agency=[[The Independent]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>

===Nutritional deficiencies in raw vegan diets===

Care is required in planning a raw vegan diet, especially for children.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=11424545 |doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(01)00167-5 |year=2001 |last1=Messina |first1=V |last2=Mangels |title=Considerations in planning vegan diets: children |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=661–9 |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |first2=AR}}</ref> Raw foodists believe that with sufficient [[food energy]], [[essential fatty acids]], [[essential amino acids]], [[vitamins]] and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], variety and density, people of all ages can be successful at eating raw foods. Dr. [[Joel Fuhrman]], author of ''Disease-Proof Your Child'', says there may not be enough vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, enough vitamin D and enough calories for a growing child on a totally raw vegan diet. Fuhrman fed his own four children raw and cooked vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains, beans and occasionally eggs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-03-14/breitman-rawfoodkids |title=The raw food diet: a half-baked idea for kids? — JSCMS |publisher=Jscms.jrn.columbia.edu |author=Rachel Breitman |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080510123927/http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-03-14/breitman-rawfoodkids |archivedate = May 10, 2008}}</ref> However, this nutritionist has made it clear in his books that he advocates 80 percent of our food should be raw, vegetable based, and that more than ten percent based on animal produce increases the risk of disease.

A study surveying people practicing raw vegan diets of varying intensities found that 30% of the women under age 45 had partial to complete [[amenorrhoea]] and that "subjects eating high amounts of raw food (> 90%) were affected more frequently than moderate raw food dieters". The study concluded that since many raw food dieters were underweight and exhibited amenorrhoea "a very strict raw vegan diet cannot be recommended on a long-term basis".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&ArtikelNr=12770&Ausgabe=224613&ProduktNr=223977 |title=Consequences of a Long-Term Raw Food Diet on Body Weight and Menstruation: Results of a Questionnaire Survey |publisher=Content.karger.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref>

==Controversies==

[[Richard Wrangham]], a primate researcher and professor of anthropology, has suggested that eating cooked food is more "natural" for the human digestive system, because the human digestive system may have evolved to deal with cooked foods.<ref name="isbn0195183460">{{Cite book|last=Clement |first=Brian|editor=Ungar, Peter S.|title=Evolution of the Human Diet: The Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, USA |isbn=0-19-518346-0 |pages=308–23 |chapter=The Cooking Enigma }}</ref><ref name="pmid14527628">{{Cite journal|pmid=14527628 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(03)00020-5 |url=http://artsci.wustl.edu/~hpontzer/Courses/Wrangham&Conklin-Britain2003CBP%20Cooking%20as%20a%20Biological%20Trait.pdf |year=2003 |last1=Wrangham |first1=R |last2=Conklin-Brittain |title='Cooking as a biological trait' |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=35–46 |journal=Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Most other anthropologists oppose Wrangham,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Pennisi_99.html |title=Pennisi: Did Cooked Tubers Spur the Evolution of Big Brains? |work=Cogweb.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> stating that archeological evidence suggests that cooking fires began in earnest only c.250,000 years ago, when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burnt animal bones, and flint appear across Europe and the Middle East.
