'''Arsenic poisoning''' is a medical condition caused by elevated levels of [[arsenic]] in the body. The dominant basis of arsenic poisoning is from [[ground water]] that naturally contains high concentrations of arsenic.  A 2007 study found that over 137 million people in more than 70 countries are probably affected by arsenic poisoning from drinking water.<ref>See:

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of arsenic poisoning begin with headaches, confusion, severe diarrhea, and drowsiness. As the poisoning develops, convulsions and changes in fingernail pigmentation called [[leukonychia]] may occur. When the poisoning becomes acute, symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, blood in the urine, cramping muscles, hair loss, stomach pain, and more convulsions. The organs of the body that are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs, skin, kidneys, and liver.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/8644  | title=Test ID: ASU.

==Exposure modalities==

=== Drinking water ===
{{Main|Arsenic contamination of groundwater}}
[[chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] arsenic poisoning results from drinking contaminated well water over a long period of time. Many aquifers contain high concentration of arsenic salts.<ref>[http://who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/arsenicosis/en/ WHO Water-related diseases]</ref> Mining techniques such as [[hydraulic fracturing]] mobilize arsenic in groundwater and aquifers due to enhanced methane 28 transport and resulting changes in redox conditions,<ref name="mobile arsenic">

''Arsenic contamination in the world.'' London: IWA Publishing.</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] recommends a limit of 0.01&nbsp;mg/L (10ppb) of arsenic in drinking water. This recommendation was established based on the limit of detection of available testing equipment at the time of publication of the WHO water quality guidelines.

More recent findings show that consumption of water with levels as low as 0.00017&nbsp;mg/L (0.17ppb) over long periods of time can lead to arsenicosis. From a 1988 study in China, the US protection agency quantified the lifetime exposure of arsenic in drinking water at concentrations of 0.0017&nbsp;mg/L, 0.00017&nbsp;mg/L, and 0.000017&nbsp;mg/L are associated with a lifetime skin cancer risk of 1 in 10,000, 1 in 100,000, and 1 in 1,000,000 respectively. The World Health Organization contends that a level of 0.01&nbsp;mg/L poses a risk of 6 in 10000 chance of lifetime skin cancer risk and contends that this level of risk is acceptable.<ref>{{cite web  | url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/arsenic2/en/index2.html  | title=Towards an assessment of the socioeconomic impact of arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh: Health effects of arsenic in drinking water  | accessdate=2012-09-20  | work=Drinking Water Quality  | publisher=WHO }}</ref>

One of the worst cases of accidental arsenic poisoning via well water occurred in Bangladesh, and was called by the World Health Organization the "largest mass poisoning of a population in history."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://healthmad.com/health/poisons-in-the-well-exposure-health-effects-and-remediation-of-arsenic-and-manganese-in-bangladesh |title=Poisons in The Well: Exposure, Health Effects and Remediation of Arsenic and Manganese in Bangladesh |accessdate=2009-11-01|publisher=Ebey Soman and HealthMad}}</ref>

===Occupational exposures===
Industries that use inorganic arsenic and its compounds include wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/arsenic/index.html |title=OSHA Arsenic |accessdate=2007-10-08|publisher=United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012033424/http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/arsenic/index.html| archivedate= 12 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Occupational exposure to arsenic may occur with copper or lead smelting and wood treatment, among workers involved in the production or application of pesticides containing organic arsenicals. Humans are exposed to arsenic through air, drinking water, and food (meat, fish, and poultry); poultry is usually the largest source of food-based arsenic ingestion due to usage of certain antibiotics in chicken feed. Arsenic was also found in wine if arsenic pesticides are used in the vineyard. Arsenic is well absorbed by oral and inhalation routes, widely distributed and excreted in urine; most of a single, low-level dose is excreted within a few days after consuming any form of inorganic arsenic. Remains of arsenic in nails (which show as white spots and lines) and hair can be detected years after the exposure.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Food ===
China is the only country to have set a standard for arsenic limits in food (150 ppb),<ref>http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-rice-source-arsenic-exposure.html</ref> as levels in rice exceed those in water.<ref>http://www.speciation.net/News/China-Inorganic-Arsenic-in-Rice--An-Underestimated-Health-Threat--;~/2010/05/19/5027.html</ref>  It has been found that rice is particularly susceptible to arsenic poisoning.<ref>{{cite news|title=Do you need to worry about arsenic in rice?|author=Deborah Kotz|url=http://bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2011/12/08/you-need-worry-about-arsenic-rice/KGsMAwBoe0NnYupiC68v9N/story.html|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref>  Rice grown in US has an average 260 ppb of arsenic according to a study.<ref>http://www.speciation.net/News/Surprisingly-high-concentrations-of-toxic-arsenic-species-found-in-US-rice-;~/2005/08/03/1561.html</ref>

== History ==
In addition to its presence as a poison, for centuries arsenic was used medicinally. It has been used for over 2,400 years as a part of traditional Chinese medicine.<ref>http://www.ccmp.gov.tw/en/research/result_detail.asp?relno=51&selno=0&no=95&detailno=1020</ref> In the western world, arsenic compounds, such as [[salvarsan]],  were used extensively to treat [[syphilis]] before [[penicillin]] was introduced. It was eventually replaced as a therapeutic agent by [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa drugs]] and then by other [[antibiotic]]s. Arsenic was also an ingredient in many tonics (or "[[patent medicine]]s").

In addition, during the [[Elizabethan era]], some [[women]] used a mixture of [[vinegar]], [[chalk]], and arsenic applied topically to whiten their skin. This use of arsenic was intended to prevent aging and creasing of the skin, but some arsenic was inevitably absorbed into the blood stream.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} 

Some pigments, most notably the popular [[Paris Green|Emerald Green]] (known also under several other names), were based on arsenic compounds. Overexposure to these pigments was a frequent cause of accidental poisoning of artists and craftsmen.

Arsenic became a favorite murder weapon of the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], particularly among ruling classes in Italy allegedly. Because the symptoms are similar to those of [[cholera]], which was common at the time, arsenic poisoning often went undetected.<ref>Whorton (2011) p.63</ref>  By the 19th century, it had acquired the nickname "inheritance powder," perhaps because impatient heirs were known or suspected to use it to ensure or accelerate their inheritances.<ref>Whorton (2011) p.21</ref>

In ancient [[Korea]], and particularly in [[Joseon Dynasty]], arsenic-sulfur compounds have been used as a major ingredient of ''sayak'' (사약; 賜藥), which was a poison cocktail used in [[capital punishment]] of high-profile political figures and members of the royal family.<ref>[http://imnews.imbc.com/replay/nwdesk/article/2084429_2687.html 공포의 '비소' 목재]</ref>&nbsp; Due to social and political prominence of the condemned, many of these events were well-documented, often in the [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]]; they are sometimes portrayed in historical television [[miniseries]] because of their dramatic nature.<ref>[http://spn.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/02/18/2008021800711.html 구혜선, '왕과 나' 폐비윤씨 사약받는 장면 열연 화제]</ref>

===Notable cases===
Arsenic poisoning, accidental or deliberate, has been implicated in the illness and death of a number of prominent people throughout history.

====King Faisal the 1st of Iraq (King Faisal bin Al Husain)====
According to his British nurse, Lady Badget, he suffered from symptoms similar to those of arsenic poisoning during his last visit to Switzerland for treatment in 1938, at the age of 48. His Swiss doctors found him in a very healthy situation a day before.<ref>Dr. Mohammed Al Janabi, 78 years after the murder of King Faisal the first, Iraq Law Network. http://www.qanon302.net/news/news.php?action=view&id=7230</ref>

====Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany====
Recent forensic evidence uncovered by Italian scientists suggests that [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco]] and his wife were poisoned possibly by his brother and successor [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mari F, Polettini A, Lippi D, Bertol E |title=The mysterious death of Francesco I de' Medici and Bianca Cappello: an arsenic murder? |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7582 |pages=1299–301 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17185715 |pmc=1761188 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38996.682234.AE |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1299}}</ref>

====George III of Great Britain====
[[George III of the United Kingdom|George III's]] (1738–1820) personal health was a concern throughout his long reign.  He suffered from periodic episodes of physical and mental illness, five of them disabling enough to require the King to withdraw from his duties.  In 1969, researchers asserted that the episodes of madness and other physical symptoms were characteristic of the disease [[porphyria]], which was also identified in members of his immediate and extended family. In addition, a 2004 study of samples of the King's hair<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3889903.stm | work=BBC News | title=King George III: Mad or misunderstood? | date=2004-07-13 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> revealed extremely high levels of [[arsenic]], which is a possible trigger of disease symptoms.  A 2005 article in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]''<ref>[http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20050722092109990013 Madness of King George Linked to Arsenic - AOL News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> suggested the source of the arsenic could be the [[antimony]] used as a consistent element of the King's medical treatment.  The two minerals are often found in the same ground, and mineral extraction at the time was not precise enough to eliminate arsenic from compounds containing antimony.

====Napoleon Bonaparte====
It has been suggested that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (1769–1821) suffered and died from arsenic poisoning during his imprisonment on the island of [[Saint Helena]]. Forensic samples of his hair did show high levels, 13 times the normal amount, of the element. This, however, does not prove deliberate poisoning by Napoleon's enemies: [[copper arsenite]] has been used as a [[pigment]] in some [[wallpaper]]s, and [[microbiology|microbiological]] liberation of the arsenic into the immediate environment would be possible. The case is equivocal in the absence of clearly authenticated samples of the wallpaper.  Samples of hair taken during Napoleon's lifetime also show levels of arsenic, so that arsenic from the soil could not have polluted the post-mortem sample.  Even without contaminated wallpaper or soil, commercial use of arsenic at the time provided many other routes by which Napoleon could have consumed enough arsenic to leave this forensic trace.<ref>Whorton (2011) pp.226-228</ref>

====Simón Bolívar====
South American independence leader [[Simón Bolívar]] (1783–1830), according to Dr. Paul Auwaerter from the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], may have died due to chronic arsenic poisoning further  complicated by [[bronchiectasis]] and [[lung cancer]].<ref name=2010PAresearch>{{cite news |url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100428110816.htm |title= Doctors Reconsider Health and Death of 'El Libertador,' General Who Freed South America |date= April 29, 2010 |work= [[Science Daily]] |accessdate= July 17, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100608222521/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100428110816.htm| archivedate= 8 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=TELEGRAPH>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/7690928/Simon-Bolivar-died-of-arsenic-poisoning.html Simon Bolivar died of arsenic poisoning] 7 May 2010. Nick Allen, The Telegraph. Retrieved on 17 July 2010.</ref> Dr. Auwaerter has considered murder and acute arsenic poisoning unlikely, arguing that gradual "environmental contact with arsenic would have been entirely possible" as a result of drinking contaminated water in [[Peru]] or through the medicinal use of arsenic -which was common at the time- as Bolívar had reportedly resorted to it during the treatment for some of his illnesses.<ref name=2010PAresearch />

====Charles Francis Hall====
American explorer [[Charles Francis Hall]] (1821–1871) died unexpectedly during his third [[Polaris expedition|Arctic expedition]] aboard the ship ''[[Polaris (ship)|Polaris]]''.  After returning to the ship from a sledging expedition Hall drank a cup of coffee and fell violently ill.<ref name="Mowat Farley 1967, p. 124">Mowat Farley. 'The Polar Passion: The Quest for the North Pole'. Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1967, p. 124</ref>  He collapsed in what was described as a fit.  He suffered from vomiting and delirium for the next week, then seemed to improve for a few days.  He accused several of the ship's company, including ship's physician Dr. [[Emil Bessels]] with whom he had longstanding disagreements, of having poisoned him.<ref name="Mowat Farley 1967, p. 124" />  Shortly thereafter, Hall again began suffering the same symptoms, died, and was taken ashore for burial.  Following the expedition's return a US Navy investigation ruled that Hall had died from [[apoplexy]].<ref>Parry, Richard. 'Trial By Ice: The True Story of Murder and Survival on the 1871 Polaris Expedition'. New York: Ballantine Books, 2001, p. 293</ref>

In 1968, however, Hall's biographer [[Chauncey C. Loomis]], a professor at [[Dartmouth College]], traveled to [[Greenland]] to exhume Hall's body.  Due to the [[permafrost]], Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well preserved.  Tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall died of poisoning from large doses of [[arsenic]] in the last two weeks of his life,<ref>Fleming, Fergus. 'Ninety Degrees North: The Quest for the North Pole'. New York: Grove Press, 2001, p. 142</ref> consistent with the symptoms party members reported.  It is possible that Hall dosed himself with [[quackery|quack medicines]] which included the poison,  but it is possible that he was [[murder]]ed by Dr. Bessels or one of the other members of the expedition.<ref>{{cite web|author= Chauncey Loomis|title= Charles Francis Hall 1821–1871|url= http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic35-3-442.pdf}}</ref>

====Huo Yuan Jia====
[[Huo Yuan Jia]] made his name as a Chinese martial artist. There was rumour that he was poisoned in 1910.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

====Clare Boothe Luce====
[[Clare Boothe Luce]], (1903–1987) the [[United States of America|American]] ambassador to [[Italy]] 1953–1956, did not die from arsenic poisoning, but suffered an increasing variety of physical and psychological symptoms until arsenic was implicated. Its source was traced to the flaking arsenic-laden paint on the ceiling of her bedroom. She may also have eaten food contaminated by arsenic in flaking ceiling paint in the embassy dining room.<ref>Whorton (2011) p.356</ref>

====Impressionist painters====
{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}
[[Paris Green|Emerald Green]], a [[pigment]] frequently used by [[Impressionist]] [[Painting|painter]]s, contains arsenic. [[Cézanne]] developed severe [[diabetes]], which is a symptom of chronic arsenic poisoning. [[Monet]]'s blindness and [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]'s neurological disorders could have been partially due to their use of Emerald Green. Poisoning by other commonly used substances, including liquor and [[absinthe]], [[lead]] pigments, mercury-based [[Vermilion]], and [[solvents]] such as [[turpentine]], could also be a factor in these cases.

====Emperor Guangxu====
In 2008, testing in the People's Republic of China confirmed that China's [[Guangxu Emperor|second-to-last emperor]] was poisoned with a massive dose of arsenic; suspects include his dying aunt, the Empress Dowager [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]], and her strongman, [[Yuan Shikai]].<ref>See:

====Phar Lap====
The famous and largely successful [[Australia]]n racehorse [[Phar Lap]] died suddenly in 1932.  Poisoning was considered as a cause of death and several forensic examinations were completed at the time of death.  In a recent examination, 75 years after his death, forensic scientists determined that the horse had ingested a massive dose of arsenic shortly before his death.<ref>{{cite web | last =   | first = | title = Phar Lap 'died from arsenic poisoning'| publisher = [[The Age]]| date = 19 June 2008 | url = http://news.theage.com.au/national/phar-lap-died-from-arsenic-poisoning-20080619-2t3m.html| accessdate = 2008-01-09}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Arsenic toxicity}}

Arsenic interferes with cellular longevity by [[allosteric inhibition]] of an essential metabolic enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] (PDH) complex, which catalyzes the oxidation of [[pyruvate]] to [[acetyl-CoA]] by [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]<sup>+</sup>. With the enzyme inhibited, the energy system of the cell is disrupted resulting in a cellular [[apoptosis]] episode. Biochemically, arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a clinical picture resembling [[thiamine deficiency]]. Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to [[lactic acidosis]]. Low potassium levels in the cells increases the risk of experiencing a life-threatening heart rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide.
Arsenic in cells clearly stimulates the production of [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). When the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reacts with certain metals such as [[iron]] or [[manganese]] it produces a highly reactive [[hydroxyl radical]]. Inorganic [[arsenic trioxide]] found in ground water particularly affects [[voltage-gated potassium channel]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou J, Wang W, Wei QF, Feng TM, Tan LJ, Yang BF |title=Effects of arsenic trioxide on voltage-dependent potassium channels and on cell proliferation of human multiple myeloma cells |journal=Chin.

{{quote|Arsenic exposure plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular endothelial dysfunction as it inactivates endothelial nitric oxide synthase, leading to reduction in the generation and bioavailability of nitric oxide. In addition, the chronic arsenic exposure induces high oxidative stress, which may affect the structure and function of cardiovascular system. Further, the arsenic exposure has been noted to induce atherosclerosis by increasing the platelet aggregation and reducing [[fibrinolysis]]. Moreover, arsenic exposure may cause arrhythmia by increasing the QT interval and accelerating the cellular calcium overload. The chronic exposure to arsenic upregulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule and vascular endothelial growth factor to induce cardiovascular pathogenesis.|Pitchai Balakumar1 and Jagdeep Kaur, "Arsenic Exposure and Cardiovascular Disorders: An Overview", ''Cardiovascular Toxicology'', December 2009<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Balakumar |first1=Pitchai |last2=Kaur |first2=Jagdeep |date=December 2009 |title=Arsenic Exposure and Cardiovascular Disorders: An Overview |journal=Cardiovascular Toxicology |volume=9 |issue=4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x0k1jtuj11745550/?p=ed19d21728b9483fbce43e4b4255802e&pi=1 |doi=10.1007/s12012-009-9050-6 |pmid=19787300 |pages=169–76 }}</ref>}}

Tissue culture studies have shown that arsenic blocks both IKr and Iks channels and, at the same time, activates
IK-ATP channels. Arsenic also disrupts [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production through several mechanisms. At the level of the [[citric acid cycle]], arsenic inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] and by competing with phosphate it uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]], thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]],  mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system [[organ failure]], probably from [[necrotic]] cell death, not [[apoptosis]]. A [[post mortem]] reveals brick red colored [[mucosa]], due to severe [[hemorrhage]].  Although arsenic causes toxicity, it can also play a protective role.<ref>{{cite book | pages = 512 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn =  978-0-07-138914-3 | title = Casarett and Doull's Essentials of Toxicology | year = 2003|  first = Curtis | last = Klaassen  | coauthors = Watkins, John}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Arsenic may be measured in blood or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal over dosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Organic arsenic compounds tend to be eliminated in the urine in unchanged form, while inorganic forms are largely converted to organic arsenic compounds in the body prior to urinary excretion. The current biological exposure index for U.S. workers of 35&nbsp;µg/L total urinary arsenic may easily be exceeded by a healthy person eating a seafood meal.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 106-110.</ref>

There are tests available to diagnose poisoning by measuring arsenic in blood, urine, hair, and fingernails. The urine test is the most reliable test for arsenic exposure within the last few days. Urine testing needs to be done within 24–48&nbsp;hours for an accurate analysis of an acute exposure. Tests on hair and fingernails can measure exposure to high levels of arsenic over the past 6–12 months. These tests can determine if one has been exposed to above-average levels of arsenic. They cannot predict, however, whether the arsenic levels in the body will affect health.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts2.html | publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry | accessdate = 2009-01-06 | title = ToxFAQs for Arsenic| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090115003804/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts2.html| archivedate= 15 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Chronic arsenic exposure can remain in the body systems for a longer period of time than a shorter term or more isolated exposure and can be detected in a longer time frame after the introduction of the arsenic, important in trying to determine the source of the exposure.

Hair is a potential bioindicator for arsenic exposure due to its ability to store trace elements from blood. Incorporated elements maintain their position during growth of hair. Thus for a temporal estimation of exposure, an assay of hair composition needs to be carried out with a single hair which is not possible with older techniques requiring homogenization and dissolution of several strands of hair. This type of biomonitoring has been achieved with newer microanalytical techniques like Synchroton radiation based X ray fluorescence (SXRF) spectroscopy and Microparticle induced X ray emission (PIXE).The highly focused and intense beams study small spots on biological samples allowing analysis to micro level along with the chemical speciation. In a study, this method has been used to follow arsenic level before, during and after treatment with Arsenious oxide in patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nicolis I, Curis E, Deschamps P, Bénazeth S |title=Arsenite medicinal use, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and monitoring in human hair |journal=Biochimie |volume=91 |issue=10 |pages=1260–7 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19527769 |doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2009.06.003 |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==

===Chelation===
Chemical and synthetic methods are now used to treat arsenic poisoning.  [[Dimercaprol]] and [[dimercaptosuccinic acid]] are [[chelating agents]] which sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins and are used in treating acute arsenic poisoning.  The most important side effect is [[hypertension]].  Dimercaprol is considerably more toxic than succimer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/MMX/Dimercaprol.html Dimercaprol Drug Information, Professional<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Mineral supplements===
Supplemental potassium  decreases the risk of experiencing a life-threatening heart rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide.<ref>Arsenic Trioxide (Trisenox®)The Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania Last Modified: December 25, 2005</ref>

===Nutritional intervention===
Rats daily dosed with arsenic in their water, in levels equivalent to those found in groundwater in Bangladesh and West Bengal were found to respond to [[garlic]] extracts, with 40 percent less arsenic in their blood and liver, and passed 45 percent more arsenic in their urine. The conclusion is that sulfur-containing substances in garlic scavenge arsenic from tissues and blood. The presentation concludes that people in areas at risk of arsenic contamination in the water supply should eat one to three cloves of garlic per day as a preventative.<ref name="urlFood and Chemical Toxicology - Elsevier">{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/237/description#description++ |title=Food and Chemical Toxicology - Elsevier |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090302013014/http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/237/description#description| archivedate= 2 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="urlGarlic combats arsenic poisoning - health - 14 January 2008 - New Scientist">{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726385.100-garlic-combats-arsenic-poisoning.html |title=Garlic combats arsenic poisoning - health - 14 January 2008 - New Scientist |work= |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref><ref name="urlScienceDirect - Food and Chemical Toxicology : In vitro and in vivo reduction of sodium arsenite induced toxicity by aqueous garlic extract">{{cite journal | last1 = Chowdhury | first1 = R | last2 = Dutta | first2 = A | last3 = Chaudhuri | first3 = S | last4 = Sharma | first4 = N | last5 = Giri | first5 = A | last6 = Chaudhuri | first6 = K | title = In vitro and in vivo reduction of sodium arsenite induced toxicity by aqueous garlic extract | journal = [[Food and Chemical Toxicology]] | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 740–51 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17983699 | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2007.09.108 }}</ref>
