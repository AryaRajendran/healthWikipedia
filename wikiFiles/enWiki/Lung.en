The '''lung''' is the essential [[respiration organ]] in many air-breathing [[animal]]s, including most [[tetrapod]]s, a few [[fish]] and a few [[snail]]s. In [[mammal]]s and the more complex life forms, the two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the [[heart]]. Their principal function is to transport [[oxygen]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] into the [[bloodstream]], and to release [[carbon dioxide]] from the bloodstream into the atmosphere. This exchange of gases is accomplished in the mosaic of specialized [[cell (biology)|cells]] that form millions of tiny, exceptionally thin-walled air sacs called [[alveoli]].

To completely explain the anatomy of the lungs, it is necessary to discuss the passage of air through the mouth to the [[alveoli]]. Once air progresses through the mouth or nose, it travels through the [[oropharynx]], [[nasopharynx]], the [[larynx]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and a progressively subdividing system of [[bronchi]] and [[bronchioles]] until it finally reaches the [[alveoli]] where the gas exchange of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]] takes place.<ref>Wienberger, Cockrill, Mandel. ''Principles of Pulmonary Medicine.'' Elsevier Science.{{Verify source|year,isbn,pn?|date=April 2010}}</ref>

The drawing and expulsion of air ([[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]) is driven by [[muscle|muscular]] action; in early [[tetrapod]]s, air was driven into the lungs by the [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] muscles via [[buccal pumping]], whereas in [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s a more complicated [[musculoskeletal system]] is used.

Medical terms related to the lung often begin with ''pulmo-'', such as in the ([[adjectival form]]: [[wiktionary:pulmonary|pulmonary]])  or from the [[Latin]] ''pulmonarius'' ("of the lungs"), or with ''pneumo-'' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πνεύμων "lung").

==Mammalian lungs==
{{further2|[[Human lung]]}}
The lungs of mammals have a spongelike and soft texture and are honeycombed with [[epithelium]], having a much larger surface area in total than the outer surface area of the lung itself. The [[human lung|lungs of humans]] are a typical example of this type of lung.

Breathing is largely driven by the muscular [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] at the bottom of the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm pulls the bottom of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed downward, increasing volume and thus decreasing pressure, causing air to flow into the airways. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the pharynx, then the [[larynx]] and into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], which branches out into the main bronchi and then subsequent divisions.  During normal [[breath]]ing, expiration is passive and no muscles are contracted (the diaphragm relaxes). The [[rib cage]] itself is also able to expand and contract to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is transported into or expelled out of the lungs. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's [[bellows]].<ref>{{Cite book

===Anatomy===

[[File:Right lung.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Human right lung]]

In humans, the trachea divides into the two main bronchi that enter the roots of the lungs. The bronchi continue to divide within the lung, and after multiple divisions, give rise to bronchioles.  The bronchial tree continues branching until it reaches the level of terminal bronchioles, which lead to alveolar sacs.  Alveolar sacs, sometimes called infundibula, are made up of clusters of [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], like individual grapes within a bunch.  The individual alveoli are tightly wrapped in blood vessels and it is here that gas exchange actually occurs.  Deoxygenated blood from the [[heart]] is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the lungs, where oxygen [[diffusion|diffuses]] into blood and is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the [[hemoglobin]] of the [[Red blood cell|erythrocytes]].  The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins to be pumped back into systemic circulation.{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/lung/picture-of-the-lungs |title= Lung Disease & Respiratory Health Center|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}} 
[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|thumb]]
Human lungs are located in two cavities on either side of the heart.  Though similar in appearance, the two are not identical.  Both are separated into [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]] by fissures, with three lobes on the right and two on the left.  The lobes are further divided into segments and then into lobules, hexagonal divisions of the lungs that are the smallest subdivision visible to the naked eye.  The connective tissue that divides lobules is often blackened in smokers.  The medial border of the right lung is nearly vertical, while the left lung contains a [[Cardiac notch of left lung|cardiac notch]].  The cardiac notch is a concave impression molded to accommodate the shape of the heart.

Each lobe is surrounded by a [[pleural cavity]], which consists of two pleurae. The parietal pleura lies against the rib cage, and the visceral pleura lies on the surface of the lungs. In between the pleura is pleural fluid. The pleural cavity helps to lubricate the lungs, as well as providing surface tension to keep the lung surface in contact with the rib cage.

Lungs are to a certain extent 'overbuilt' and have a tremendous reserve volume as compared to the oxygen exchange requirements when at rest.  Such excess capacity is one of the reasons that individuals can smoke for years without having a noticeable decrease in lung function while still or moving slowly; in situations like these only a small portion of the lungs are actually perfused with blood for gas exchange. Destruction of too many alveoli over time leads to the condition [[emphysema]], which is associated with extreme shortness of breath. As oxygen requirements increase due to [[exercise]], a greater volume of the lungs is perfused, allowing the body to match its [[Carbon Dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]/[[Oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] exchange requirements. Additionally, due to the excess capacity, it is possible for humans to live with only one lung, with the one compensating for the other's loss.

The environment of the lung is very moist, which makes it hospitable for [[bacteria]]. Many respiratory illnesses are the result of bacterial or [[virus|viral]] [[infection]] of the lungs. Inflammation of the lungs is known as [[pneumonia]]; inflammation of the [[pleura]] surrounding the lungs is known as [[pleurisy]].

[[Vital capacity]] is the maximum volume of air that a person can exhale after maximum inhalation; it can be measured with a [[spirometer]]. In combination with other physiological measurements, the vital capacity can help make a diagnosis of underlying lung disease.

The ''lung [[parenchyma]]'' is strictly used to refer solely to [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] tissue with [[respiratory bronchiole]]s, [[alveolar duct]]s and [[terminal bronchiole]]s.<ref name=medilexicon/> However, it often includes any form of lung tissue, also including [[bronchioles]], [[bronchi]], [[blood vessel]]s and [[lung interstitium]].<ref name=medilexicon>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=65361 medilexicon.com > Medical Dictionary - 'Parenchyma Of Lung'] In turn citing: Stedman's Medical Dictionary. 2006</ref>

===Non respiratory functions===
In addition to their function in respiration, the lungs also:
* Alter the [[pH]] of blood by facilitating alterations in the partial pressure of [[carbon dioxide]]
* Filter out small [[thrombus|blood clots]] formed in [[vein]]s
* Filter out gas micro-bubbles occurring in the [[Vein|venous]] blood stream such as those created during [[decompression (diving)|decompression]] after [[underwater diving]] .<ref>Wienke B.R. : "Decompression theory"{{Verify source|journal article or book?|date=April 2010}}</ref>
* Influence the concentration of some biologic substances and drugs used in medicine in blood
* Convert [[angiotensin|angiotensin I]] to [[angiotensin|angiotensin II]] by the action of [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]]
* May serve as a layer of soft, [[shock (mechanics)|shock]]-absorbent protection for the [[cardiac|heart]], which the lungs flank and nearly enclose.
* [[Immunoglobulin]]-A is secreted in the bronchial secretion and protects against respiratory infections.

* Ciliary escalator action is an important defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air are caught in the mucous layer present at the mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.
* Provide airflow for the creation of vocal sounds.
*The lungs serve as a reservoir of blood in the body. The blood volume of the lungs is about '''450''' milliliters on average, about '''9''' percent of the total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. This quantity can easily fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume. Loss of blood from the systemic circulation by '''hemorrhage''' can be partially compensated for by shunting blood from the '''lungs into the systemic vessels'''<ref>GUYTON&HALL Medical physiology 12th edition</ref>

==Avian lungs==

[[File:Bird respiration air flow schematic.png|thumb|300px|Bird respiration air flow schematic]]
[[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|Avian lungs]] do not have alveoli as mammalian lungs do; birds have Faveolar lungs, which contain millions of tiny passages called parabronchi. There are air vesicles, called atria, which project radially from the walls of the parabronchi. The gas exchange tissues are set into the walls of the atria and gases travel via [[diffusion]] between the gas exchange tissues and the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of each parabronchus. There are two categories of parabronchi. The paleopulmonic parabronchi are found in all birds and air flows through them in the same direction{{spaced ndash}}posterior to anterior during inhalation and exhalation. Some bird species also have neopulmonic parabronch where the air flow is bidirectional. The paleopulmonic unidirectional airflow is in contrast to the mammalian system, in which the direction of airflow in the lung is tidal, reversing between inhalation and exhalation.

By utilizing a unidirectional flow of air, avian lungs are able to extract a greater concentration of oxygen from inhaled air. Birds are thus equipped to fly at altitudes at which mammals would succumb to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. This also allows them to sustain a higher [[Metabolism|metabolic rate]] than most equivalent weight mammals.<ref name=AvResp/> Note than some species of small bats have a higher mean total morphometnc pulmonary diffusing capacity for oxygen than equivalent weight birds but this is the exception and is not the rule.<ref name=bat-lungs>{{cite journal|last=Maina|first=John N.|coauthors=A. S. King|title=Correlations between structure and function in the design of the bat lung: a morphometric study|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=July 1, 1984|volume=111|issue=1|pages=43–61|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/111/1/43.full.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> 

The lungs of birds are relatively small, but are connected to 8-9 air sacs that extend through much of the body, and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. The air sacs, although thin walled, are poorly vascularized, and do not themselves contribute much to gas exchange, but they do act like [[bellows]] to [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilate]] the lungs. The air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume of the combined thorax and abdominal cavity. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronized with movement of the flight muscles.<ref name=VB>{{Cite book|last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |last2=Parsons |first2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=330–334 |isbn=0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

Because of the complexity of the system, misunderstanding is common and it is incorrectly believed that it takes two breathing cycles for air to pass entirely through a bird's respiratory system.  Air is not stored in either the posterior or anterior sacs between respiration cycles, air moves continuously from the posterior to the anterior of the lungs throughout respiration. This type of lung construction is called a circulatory lung, as distinct from the bellows lung possessed by other animals.<ref name=AvResp>{{Cite web| url = http://www.people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdrespiration.html | title = BIO 554/754 - Ornithology: Avian respiration | accessdate = 2009-04-23 | last = Ritchson | first = G | publisher = Department of Biological Sciences, Eastern Kentucky University }}</ref>

==Reptilian lungs==
{{main|Reptile anatomy#Respiration}}
[[Reptile|Reptilian]] lungs are typically ventilated by a combination of expansion and contraction of the ribs via axial muscles and buccal pumping. [[Crocodilian]]s also rely on the [[hepatic]] piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis), which in turn pulls the bottom of the lungs backward, expanding them. [[Turtle]]s, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and [[pectoral girdle]] to force air in and out of the lungs.<ref name=VB/>

The lung of most reptiles has a single bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to, but much larger and fewer in number than, mammalian alveoli, and give the lung a sponge-like texture. In [[tuatara]]s, [[snake]]s, and some [[lizard]]s, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical amphibians.<ref name=VB/>

Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent. [[Amphisbaenian]]s, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.<ref name=VB/>

==Amphibian lungs==
The lungs of most [[frog]]s and other [[amphibian]]s are simple balloon-like structures, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface area of the lung. This is not a very efficient arrangement, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and also frequently supplement their oxygen supply by diffusion across the moist outer skin of their bodies. Unlike mammals, which use a breathing system driven by [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], amphibians employ [[positive pressure]].<ref name=VB/> The majority of salamander species are [[lungless salamander]]s, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their mouth. The only other known lungless [[tetrapod]]s are also amphibians; the [[Bornean Flat-headed Frog]] (''Barbourula kalimantanensis'') and ''[[Atretochoana eiselti]]'', a [[caecilian]].

The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow [[septum|septa]] of soft tissue around the outer walls, increasing the respiratory surface area and giving the lung a honey-comb appearance. In some salamanders even these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. In caecilians, as in snakes, only the right lung attains any size or development.<ref name=VB/>

==Lungfish==
The lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the [[Australian lungfish]], there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and ''[[Polypterus]]'', however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving round and above the [[esophagus]]. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.<ref name=VB/>

==Invertebrate lungs==
Some [[invertebrate]]s have "lungs" that serve a similar respiratory purpose as, but are not evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. Some [[arachnid]]s have structures called "[[book lung]]s" used for atmospheric gas exchange. The [[Coconut crab]] uses structures called [[Branchiostegal lung]]s to breathe air and indeed will drown in water, hence it breathes on land and holds its breath underwater. The [[Pulmonata]] are an order of snails and slugs that have developed "lungs".

==Origins of the vertebrate lung==
The lungs of today's terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s and the [[gas bladder]]s of today's [[fish]] are believed to have evolved from simple sacs (outpocketings) of the [[esophagus]] that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions.<ref name=farmer>{{Cite journal|title=Did lungs and the intracardiac shunt evolve to oxygenate the heart in vertebrates |author=Colleen Farmer |journal=Paleobiology |year=1997 |url=http://www.biology.utah.edu/farmer/publications%20pdf/1997%20Paleobiology23.pdf}}</ref> These outpocketings first arose in the  [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]]; in some of the [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] the sacs evolved into gas bladders, while in other ray-finned fish (such as the [[gar]], [[bichir]] and [[Bowfin|amia]]) as well as the [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] they evolved into lungs.<ref name="farmer"/> The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based [[tetrapod]]s. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their [[gill]]s). This is reflected by the fact that the lungs of a [[fetus]] also develop from an outpocketing of the [[esophagus]] and in the case of gas bladders, this connection to the [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] continues to exist as the [[pneumatic duct]] in more "primitive" [[teleost]]s, and is lost in the higher orders. (This is an instance of correlation between [[ontogeny and phylogeny]].) No known animals have both a gas bladder and lungs.
