'''Chest pain''' may be a symptom of a number of serious conditions and is generally considered a [[medical emergency]].  Even though it may be determined that the [[pain]] is '''non-cardiac''' in origin, this is often a diagnosis of exclusion made after ruling out more serious causes of the pain.

==Differential diagnosis==
Causes of chest pain range from non-serious to serious to life threatening.<ref name=ER09>{{cite journal |author=Woo KM, Schneider JI |title=High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain--the big three |journal=Emerg.

===Cardiovascular===

* [[Acute coronary syndrome]]
** Unstable [[Angina Pectoris]] - requiring emergency medical treatment but not primary intervention as in a myocardial infarction.
** [[Myocardial infarction]] ("heart attack")<ref>{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=T | title=Myocardial Infarction | journal=Focus on First Aid | volume= | issue=15 | page=15 | year=2010 | pmid= | url=http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue15/index.aspx | accessdate=2010-06-08 | doi= }}</ref>
* [[Aortic dissection]]
*[[Pericarditis]] and [[cardiac tamponade]]
* [[Cardiac arrhythmia|Arrhythmia]] - [[atrial fibrillation]] and a number of other arrhythmias can cause chest pain.
* Stable [[angina pectoris]] - this can be treated medically and although it warrants investigation, it is not an emergency in its strictest sense
* [[Myocarditis]]
* [[Mitral valve prolapse]] syndrome
* [[Aortic aneurysm]]

===Respiratory===
* [[Pulmonary embolism]]
* [[Pneumonia]]
* [[Hemothorax]]
* [[Pneumothorax]] and [[Tension pneumothorax]]
* [[Pleurisy]] - an inflammation which can cause painful respiration
* [[Tuberculosis]]
* [[Tracheitis]]
* [[Lung cancer|Lung malignancy]]

===Gastrointestinal===
* [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) and other causes of [[heartburn]]
* [[Hiatus hernia]]
* [[Achalasia]], [[nutcracker esophagus]] and other neuromuscular disorders of the [[esophagus]]
* [[Functional dyspepsia]]

===Chest wall===
* [[Costochondritis]] or [[Tietze's syndrome]] - a benign and harmless form of osteochondritis often mistaken for heart disease
* [[Spinal nerve]] problem
* [[Fibromyalgia]]
* [[Thoracic cavity|Chest wall]] problems
* [[Radiculopathy]]
* [[Precordial catch syndrome]] - another benign and harmless form of a sharp, localised chest pain often mistaken for heart disease
* [[Breast]] conditions
* [[Herpes zoster]] commonly known as shingles
* [[Tuberculosis]]
* [[Osteoarthritis]]
* [[Bornholm disease]]

===Psychological===
* [[Panic attack]]
* [[Anxiety]]
* [[Clinical depression]]
* [[Somatization disorder]]
* [[Hypochondria]]

===Others===
* [[Hyperventilation syndrome]] often presents with chest pain and a tingling sensation of the fingertips and around the mouth
* [[Da costa's syndrome]]
* [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]]
* [[Sarcoidosis]]
* [[Lead poisoning]]
* High [[abdominal pain]] may also mimic chest pain
* Prolapsed [[intervertebral disc]]
* [[Thoracic outlet syndrome]]

==Diagnostic approach==
'''History taking:'''

Knowing a patient's risk factors can be extremely useful in ruling in or ruling out serious causes of chest pain. For example, [[heart attack]] and [[thoracic aortic dissection]] are very rare in healthy individuals under 30 years of age, but significantly more common in individuals with significant risk factors, such as older age, smoking, [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], history of [[coronary artery disease]] or [[stroke]], positive family history (premature [[atherosclerosis]], [[cholesterol]] disorders, [[heart attack]] at early age), and other risk factors. 

'''Physical examination:'''

In the emergency department the typical approach to chest pain involves ruling out the most dangerous causes: [[heart attack]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[thoracic aortic dissection]], [[esophageal rupture]], [[tension pneumothorax]] and [[cardiac tamponade]].  By elimination or confirmation of the most serious causes, a diagnosis of the origin of the pain may be made. Often, no definite cause will be found and reassurance is then provided.<ref name=ER09/>

If [[acute coronary syndrome]] ("unstable angina") is suspected, many people are admitted briefly for observation, sequential ECGs, and determination of [[cardiac enzymes]] over time. On occasion, further tests on follow up may determine the cause. TIMI score performed at time of admission may help stratify risk. Features of the pain suggestive of cardiac ischaemia are describing the pain as heaviness; radiation of the pain to the neck, jaw or left arm; sweating; nausea; palpitations; the pain being felt upon exertion; dizziness; shortness of breath; and a "sense of impending doom."

Careful medical history and physical examination is essential in separating dangerous from trivial causes of disease, and the management of chest pain may be done on specialised units (termed ''medical assessment units'') to concentrate the investigations. Occasionally, invisible medical signs will direct the diagnosis towards particular causes, such as [[Levine's sign]] in [[cardiac ischemia]]. A rapid diagnosis can be life-saving and often has to be made without the help of medical tests, however, additional tests are generally required to establish the diagnosis.

'''Medical tests:'''

On the basis of the above, a number of tests may be ordered:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hess EP, Perry JJ, Ladouceur P, Wells GA, Stiell IG |title=Derivation of a clinical decision rule for chest radiography in emergency department patients with chest pain and possible acute coronary syndrome |journal=CJEM |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=128–34 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20219160 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

* [[X-ray]]s of the chest and abdomen .  Routine X-rays however are not needed.
* [[Computed tomography|CT scanning]] may be used in unexplained chest pain when other tests are inconclusive.
* An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG)
* [[Ventilation/perfusion scan|V/Q scintigraphy]] or [[CT pulmonary angiogram]](when a [[pulmonary embolism]] is suspected)
* Blood tests:
** [[Complete blood count]]
** [[Electrolyte]]s and [[renal function]] ([[creatinine]])
** [[Liver function tests|Liver enzyme]]s
** [[Creatine kinase]] (and ''CK-MB'' fraction in many hospitals)
** [[Troponin]] I or T (to indicate [[myocardium|myocardial]] damage)
** [[D-dimer]] (when suspicion for [[pulmonary embolism]] is present but low)
** serum [[lipase]] to exclude acute pancreatitis

==Management==
In people with chest pain supplemental [[oxygen]] is not needed unless the [[oxygen saturations]] are less than 94% or there are signs of [[Shortness of breath|respiratory distress]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@ecc/documents/downloadable/ucm_317350.pdf |title=Highlights of the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC|work=American Heart Association |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=ACLS2010>{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=RE|coauthors=Brady, W, Brooks, SC, Diercks, D, Egan, J, Ghaemmaghami, C, Menon, V, O'Neil, BJ, Travers, AH, Yannopoulos, D|title=Part 10: acute coronary syndromes: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care|journal=Circulation|date=2010-11-02|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S787–817|pmid=20956226|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971028}}</ref> [[Entonox]] is frequently used by [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] personnel in the prehospital environment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Castle|first=N|title=Effective relief of acute coronary syndrome|journal=Emergency nurse : the journal of the RCN Accident and Emergency Nursing Association|date=2003 Feb|volume=10|issue=9|pages=15–9|pmid=12655961}}</ref> There is however little evidence about its effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Entonox for the Treatment of Undiagnosed Chest Pain: Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines| url=http://www.cadth.ca/media/pdf/K0089_Entonox_for_the_Treatment_of_Undiagnosed_Chest_Pain_final.pdf| work=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="ACLS2010" />

== Epidemiology ==

Chest pain is the presenting symptom in about 12% of emergency department visits in the United States and has a one year mortality of about 5%.<ref>{{cite book |author=Stephen J. Dubner; Steven D.
