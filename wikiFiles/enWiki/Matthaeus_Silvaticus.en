'''Matthaeus Silvaticus''' or '''Mattheus Sylvaticus''' (c. 1280 – c. 1342) was a medieval Latin medical writer and botanist. His main notability is a 650-page encyclopedia about medicating agents (a [[pharmacopoeia]]) which he completed about year 1317 under the Latin title ''Pandectarum Medicinae'' or ''Pandectae Medicinae'' (English: ''Encyclopedia of Medicines''). Most of the medicating agents were botanicals ("herbal medicines"). The presentation is in alphabetical order. Most of what he says is extracted from earlier medical books, including books by [[Dioscorides]], [[Avicenna]], [[Serapion the Younger]], and [[Simon of Genoa]]. As an indication of its popularity in late medieval Europe, the ''Pandectarum Medicinae'' was printed in at least eleven editions in various countries between the invention of the printing press and 1500.<ref name=cheung>''Pandectarum Medicinae'' at http://www.interzone.com/~cheung/SUM.dir/med43.html. A number of 15th century editions of the ''Pandectarum'' are online at [http://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/index.html?suchbegriff=Matthaeus+Silvaticus&c=suchen Digitale-Sammlungen.de].</ref> 

Mattheus Silvaticus was born in northern Italy, probably [[Mantua]].<ref>[http://www.archive.org/stream/dictionnairehist04eloy#page/276/mode/1up ''Dictionnaire historique de la médecine ancienne et moderne''], by N.F.J. Eloy (year 1778).</ref> He was a student and teacher in botany and medicine at the [[School of Salerno]] in southern Italy.

The medical school in Salerno was influenced by Arabic-to-Latin translations of Arabic medical literature. Matthaeus's encyclopedia was influenced by an encyclopedia of medicines by the 12th-century Arab [[Serapion the Younger]]. As one indication of Arabic influence, 233 of 487 plant names that Matthaeus used were Latinizations of Arabic plant names.<ref>[http://www.summagallicana.it/lessico/s/Silvatico%20Matteo%20-%20Sylvaticus%20Matthaeus%20-%20Silvaticus%20Matthaeus.htm Matteo Silvatico @ SummaGallicana.it] (in Italian language).</ref> Many of those Latinized Arabic names had little circulation in Latin. Readers later complained that native Latin names existed for many of them.<ref name=cheung /> Despite the wide circulation of Matthaeus's encyclopedia in 14th and 15th centuries, the Arabic names in it were generally not adopted by Latin Europe (except for the smaller number of Arabic names that had entered Latin by other, earlier pathways of transfer of Arabic medical literature to the Latins).

A substantial portion of Matthaeus's encyclopedia was copied from a shorter work by Simon of Genoa (aka Simon Januensis) entitled ''Synonyma Medicinae'', which was written a few decades earlier.<ref>A late-15th-century edition of Simon of Genoa's ''Synonyma Medicinae'' is online at [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7s28XX0mqAUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books] (in Latin). A 19th-century publication of a 15th-century Latin medical botany dictionary called the ''Alphita'' contains, in its 19th-century footnotes, many cross-references to Mattheus Silvaticus and Simon Januensis. It is downloadable at [http://www.archive.org/stream/sinonomabartholo01mirfuoft#page/n60/mode/1up ''Alphita''].</ref>
