'''Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria''' (PNH), sometimes referred to as '''Marchiafava-Micheli syndrome''', is a rare, acquired, potentially life-threatening disease of the blood characterised by complement-induced intravascular [[hemolytic anemia]] (anemia due to destruction of [[red blood cell]]s in the bloodstream), red [[urine]] (due to the appearance of [[hemoglobin]] in the urine) and [[thrombosis]]. PNH is the only hemolytic anemia caused by an ''acquired'' (rather than inherited) intrinsic defect in the [[cell membrane]] (deficiency of [[glycophosphatidylinositol]] leading to absence of protective proteins on the membrane).<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N.

Only a minority have the telltale red urine in the morning.<ref name=parker2005>{{cite journal |author=Parker C, Omine M, Richards S, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria |journal=Blood |volume=106 |issue=12 |pages=3699–709 |year=2005 |pmid=16051736 |doi=10.1182/blood-2005-04-1717| url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/106/12/3699 | pmc=1895106}}</ref>

[[Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation]] is the only curative therapy, although the [[monoclonal antibody]] [[eculizumab]] (Soliris) is effective at reducing the need for blood transfusions, improving quality of life, and reducing the risk of thrombosis.   <ref name=Brodsky>{{cite journal |author=Brodsky, RA |title=How I treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. |journal=Blood |volume=113 |issue=26 |pages=6522–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19372253 |doi=10.1182/blood-2009-03-195966| url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/113/26/6522.long | pmc=2710914 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people with "primary PNH" have red urine at some point in their disease course. Many of them continue to have low-grade breakdown of red blood cells, leading to anemia. Typical symptoms of anemia are [[tiredness]], [[shortness of breath]], and [[palpitations]]. On laboratory examination of the urine, breakdown products of red blood cells ([[hemoglobin]] and [[hemosiderin]]) may be identified.<ref name=parker2005/> A small proportion of patients report abdominal pain, [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing) and [[odynophagia]] (pain during swallowing), as well as [[erectile dysfunction]] in men - this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid.<ref name=parker2005/>

Forty percent of patients develop [[thrombosis]] (a blood clot) at some point in their illness. This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH. These may develop in common sites ([[deep vein thrombosis]] of the leg veins and resultant [[pulmonary embolism]] when these clots break off and enter the lungs), but, in PNH, blood clots may also form in more unusual sites: the [[hepatic vein]] (causing [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]]), the [[portal vein]] of the liver (causing [[portal vein thrombosis]]), the [[superior mesenteric vein|superior]] or [[inferior mesenteric vein]] (causing [[mesenteric ischemia]]), and veins of the [[skin]]. [[Cerebral venous thrombosis]], an uncommon form of [[stroke]], is more common in PNH.<ref name=parker2005/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Blood test]]s in PNH show changes consistent with intravascular [[hemolytic anemia]]: low [[hemoglobin]], raised [[lactate dehydrogenase]], raised [[reticulocyte]]s (immature red cells released by the [[bone marrow]] to replace the destroyed cells), raised [[bilirubin]] (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of [[haptoglobin]]. The [[direct antiglobulin test]] (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by [[antibody|antibodies]].<ref name=parker2005/>

Historically,<ref name = Brodsky/> the sucrose lysis test, in which a patient's red blood cells are placed in low-ionic-strength solution and observed for hemolysis, was used for screening.  If this was positive, the ''[[Ham test|Ham's acid hemolysis test]]'' (after Dr Thomas Ham, who described the test in 1937) was performed for confirmation. <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM193712022172307|author=Ham TH|title=Chronic haemolytic anaemia with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: study of the mechanism of haemolysis in relation to acid-base equilibrium|journal=N Engl J Med|year=1937|volume=217|pages=915–918|issue=23}}</ref> 

Today, many labs use [[flow cytometry]] for [[CD55]] and [[CD59]] on [[white blood cells|white]] and [[red blood cells]].  Based on the levels of these cell proteins, erythrocytes may be classified as type I, II, or III PNH cells. Type I cells have normal levels of CD55 and CD59; type II have reduced levels; and type III have absent levels. <ref name=parker2005/> The [[fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin]] (FLAER) test is being used more frequently to diagnose PNH.  FLAER binds selectively to the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor and is more accurate in demonstrating a deficit than flow cytometry for CD59 or CD55. <ref name = Brodsky/>

==Classification==
PNH is classified by the context under which it is diagnosed:<ref name=parker2005/>
* ''Classic PNH''. Evidence of PNH in the absence of another bone marrow disorder.
* ''PNH in the setting of another specified bone marrow disorder''.
* ''Subclinical PNH''. PNH abnormalities on flow cytometry without signs of hemolysis.

==Pathophysiology==
All cells have proteins attached to their membranes that are responsible for performing a vast array of functions.  There are several ways for proteins to be attached to a cell membrane. PNH occurs as a result of a defect in one of these mechanisms.<ref name=parker2005/>

The enzyme [[phosphatidylinositol glycan A]] (PIGA) is needed to make [[glycosylphosphatidylinositol]] (GPI), a molecule that anchors proteins to the cell membrane. The gene that codes for PIGA is located on the [[X chromosome]], which means that only one active copy of the gene for PIGA is present in each cell (initially, females have two copies, but one is silenced through [[X-inactivation]]). If a mutation occurs in this gene then PIGA may be defective, which leads to a defect in the GPI anchor. When this mutation occurs in a [[bone marrow]] [[stem cell]] (which are used to make red blood cells as well as white blood cells and platelets), all of the cells it produces will also have the defect.<ref name=parker2005/> Several of the proteins that anchor to GPI on the cell membrane are used to protect the cell from destruction by the [[complement system]], and, without these anchors, the cells are more easily targeted by the complement proteins.<ref name=Robbins/> The complement system is part of the [[immune system]] and helps to destroy invading microorganisms.  Without the proteins that protect them from complement, red blood cells are destroyed.  The main proteins that carry out this function are [[decay-accelerating factor]] (DAF) (CD55), which disrupts formation of C3 convertase, and protectin ([[CD59]]), which binds the [[membrane attack complex]] and prevents [[Complement component 9|C9]] from binding to the cell.<ref name=parker2005/>

The increased destruction of red blood cells results in anemia. The increased rate of thrombosis is due to dysfunction of [[platelet]]s due to binding by [[Complement system|complement]], or possibly due to low [[nitric oxide]] levels.<ref name=parker2005/>

The symptoms of esophageal spasm, erectile dysfunction, and abdominal pain are attributed to the fact that [[hemoglobin]] released during hemolysis binds with circulating nitric oxide, a substance that is needed to relax [[smooth muscle]]. This theory is supported by the fact that these symptoms improve on administration of nitrates or [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), which improves the effect of nitric oxide on muscle cells.<ref name=parker2005/> There is a suspicion that chronic hemolysis causing chronically depleted nitric oxide may lead to the development of [[pulmonary hypertension]] (increased pressure in the blood vessels supplying the lung), which in turn puts strain on the [[heart]] and causes [[heart failure]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rother RP, Bell L, Hillmen P, Gladwin MT |title=The clinical sequelae of intravascular hemolysis and extracellular plasma hemoglobin: a novel mechanism of human disease |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=13 |pages=1653–62 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15811985 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.13.1653 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/293/13/1653}}</ref>

==Treatment==
===Long-term===
PNH is a chronic condition. In patients with only a small clone and few problems, monitoring of the flow cytometry every six months gives information on the severity and risk of potential complications. Given the high risk of thrombosis in PNH, preventative treatment with [[warfarin]] decreases the risk of thrombosis in those with a large clone (50% of white blood cells type III).<ref name=parker2005/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hall C, Richards S, Hillmen P |title=Primary prophylaxis with warfarin prevents thrombosis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) |journal=Blood |volume=102 |issue=10 |pages=3587–91 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=12893760 |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-01-0009 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/102/10/3587}}</ref>

Episodes of thrombosis are treated as they would in other patients, but, given that PNH is a persisting underlying cause, it is likely that treatment with [[warfarin]] or similar drugs needs to be continued long-term after an episode of thrombosis.<ref name=parker2005/>

===Acute attacks===
There is disagreement as to whether steroids (such as [[prednisolone]]) can decrease the severity of hemolytic crises. Transfusion therapy may be needed; in addition to correcting significant [[anemia]], this suppresses the production of PNH cells by the bone marrow, and indirectly the severity of the hemolysis. Iron deficiency develops with time, due to losses in urine, and may have to be treated if present. Iron therapy can result in more hemolysis as more PNH cells are produced.<ref name=parker2005/>

A new [[monoclonal antibody]], [[eculizumab]], protects blood cells against immune destruction by inhibiting the [[complement system]]. It has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusion in patients with significant hemolysis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hillmen P, Hall C, Marsh JC, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of eculizumab on hemolysis and transfusion requirements in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria |journal=N.

New Zealand is the only country in the [[OECD]] not to fund it. <ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Plea-to-Pharmac-for-pricey-life-saver/tabid/423/articleID/284198/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Plea to Pharmac for pricey life-saver| date=January 24, 2013}}</ref>

==Screening==
Screening for PNH is performed every year in people with previous aplastic anemia, and may be performed in people with [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] of the "refractory anemia" type.<ref name=parker2005/>

==Epidemiology==
PNH is rare, with an annual rate of 1-2 cases per million. Many cases develop in people who have previously been diagnosed with  aplastic anemia or [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]. The fact that PNH develops in MDS also explains why there appears to be a higher rate of [[leukemia]] in PNH, as MDS can sometimes transform into leukemia.<ref name=parker2005/>

25% of female cases of PNH are discovered during pregnancy. This group has a high rate of thrombosis, and the risk of death of both mother and child are significantly increased (20% and 8% respectively).<ref name=parker2005/>

==History==
The first description of paroxysmal hemoglobinuria was by the [[Germany|German]] physician Paul Strübing ([[Greifswald]], 1852–1915) in 1882.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Strübing P|title=Paroxysmale Hämoglobinurie|language=German|journal=Dtsch Med Wochenschr|year=1882|volume=8|pages=1–3 and 17–21|doi=10.1055/s-0029-1196307}}</ref> A more detailed description was made by Dr Ettore Marchiafava and Dr Alessio Nazari in 1911,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marchiafava E, Nazari A|title=Nuovo contributo allo studio degli itteri cronici emolitici|language=Italian|journal=Policlinico [Med] | year=1911|volume=18|pages=241–254}}</ref> with further elaborations by Marchiafava in 1928<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marchiafava E|title=Anemia emolitica con emosiderinuria perpetua|language=Italian|journal=Policlinico [Med] |year= 1928|volume=35|pages=105–117}}</ref> and Dr Ferdinando Micheli in 1931.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Micheli F|title=Uno caso di anemia emolitica con emosiderinuria perpetua|language=Italian|journal=G Accad Med Torino|year=1931|volume=13|pages=148}}</ref><ref>{{Whonamedit|synd|2918|Strübing-Marchiafava-Micheli syndrome}}</ref> The Dutch physician Enneking coined the term "paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria" (or ''haemoglobinuria paroxysmalis nocturna'' in Latin) in 1928.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Enneking J | title=Eine neue form intermittierender haemoglobinurie (Haemoglobinuria paroxysmalis nocturia) | language=German | journal=Klin Wochensch | year=1928| volume=7 | pages=2045 | doi=10.1007/BF01846778| issue=43}}</ref>
