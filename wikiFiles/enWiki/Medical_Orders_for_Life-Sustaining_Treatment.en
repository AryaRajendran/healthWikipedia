'''MOLST''' is an [[acronym]] for Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment.  The MOLST Program is an initiative to facilitate [[End-of-life care|end-of-life]] medical decision-making in New York State that involves use of the MOLST form.  The MOLST form is a [http://www.health.state.ny.us/ New York State Department of Health] form ([http://www.health.state.ny.us/forms/doh-5003.pdf DOH-5003]).
MOLST is for patients such as a terminally ill patient who can be expected to die within six months, whether or not treatment is provided.<ref name="2994-d">[See, [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=$$PBH2994-D$$@TXPBH02994-D+&LIST=LAW+&BROWSER=BROWSER+&TOKEN=29103042+&TARGET=VIEW N.Y. Public Health Law section 2994-d]</ref>  For this example, assume the patient retains medical decision-making [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] and wants to die naturally in a residential setting, not in the [[intensive-care unit]] of a hospital on a [[ventilator]] with a [[feeding tube]].  Using MOLST, with the [[informed consent]] of the patient, the patient's doctor could issue medical orders for life-sustaining treatment, including any or all of the following medical orders: provide comfort measures ([[palliative care]]) only; do not attempt resuscitation (allow natural death); do not [[Intubation|intubate]]; do not hospitalize; no [[feeding tube]]; no [[Intravenous therapy|IV fluids]]; do not use [[antibiotic]]s; no [[dialysis]]; no [[Blood transfusion|transfusions]].  The orders should be honored by all health care providers in any setting, including [[emergency responders]] who are summoned by a [[9-1-1]] telephone call after the patient loses medical decision-making [[Capacity (law)|capacity]].<ref name="DOH website">[http://www.nyhealth.gov/professionals/patients/patient_rights/molst/ New York State Department of Health MOLST web page]</ref>

== MOLST Program ==

The MOLST Program is a New York State initiative that facilitates [[End-of-life care|end-of-life]] medical decision-making.  One goal of the MOLST Program is to ensure that decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment are made in accordance with the patient’s wishes, or, if the patient’s wishes are not reasonably known and cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained, in accordance with the patient’s best interests.<ref name="2994-d"/>

Patricia “Pat” Bomba, MD, has spearheaded the MOLST Program since its inception.  Dr. Bomba is a Vice President at [[Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield|Excellus BlueCross BlueShield]].<ref name="Bomba">[http://www.compassionandsupport.org/index.php/about_us/leadership Patricia A Bomba MD, FACP]</ref>

== Legal Basis ==

Under New York [[common law]], health care providers may withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a patient who is dying and currently lacks the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make his or her own medical decisions if doing so is based upon [[Clear_and_convincing_evidence#Clear_and_convincing_evidence|clear and convincing evidence]] of the patient’s wishes.<ref name="O'Connor">[http://www.compassionandsupport.org/pdfs/legislation/WestchesterCountyMed%20Center.pdf In re Westchester County Med. Ctr. ex rel. O’Connor, 72 N.Y.2d 517]</ref>

Since 1987, New York has had a [[Do not resuscitate|Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)]] law allowing surrogates to make decisions regarding [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] on behalf of an adult patient who lacks medical decision-making [[Capacity (law)|capacity]].<ref name="laws of 1987">[N.Y. laws of 1987, chapter 818]</ref>  In 1991, the law was amended to authorize non-hospital orders not to resuscitate.<ref name="laws of 1991">[N.Y. laws of 1991, chapter 370, section 17, codified in former N.Y. Public Health Law section 2977]</ref>  Based upon this law, the [http://www.health.ny.gov/ New York State Department of Health] created a “standard form” to issue a non-hospital order not to resuscitate ([http://www.health.state.ny.us/forms/doh-3474.pdf DOH-3474]), which is still in use today.

In 2005, the law was amended to give the [http://www.health.ny.gov/ New York State Department of Health] authority to issue “alternative forms” for issuing non-hospital orders not to resuscitate in [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]] and [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga]] Counties.<ref name="Laws of 2005">[http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/82721.pdf N.Y. laws of 2005, chapter 734], adding a subdivision (13) to former N.Y. Public Health Law section 2977]</ref>  This established MOLST as a pilot program.  In 2006, the law was amended to allow such “alternative forms” to be used to issue non-hospital Do Not [[Intubate]] (DNI) orders.<ref name="Laws of 2006">[http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/79356.pdf N.Y. laws of 2006, chapter 325]</ref>  This was necessary because in New York State, [[Emergency medical services in the United States|emergency medical services]] personnel may only honor a [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] order in the event of a [[Cardiac arrest|cardiac]] or [[respiratory arrest]] and would still [[intubate]] a patient with a [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] order unless the patient's heart or breathing has completely stopped.<ref name="EMS policy">[http://www.nyhealth.gov/nysdoh/ems/pdf/11-02.pdf New York State Department of Health Bureau of Emergency Medical Services Policy 11-02]</ref>

[[Image:The MOLST Form.JPG|thumb|alt=Alt|The MOLST Form]]In 2008, MOLST ceased to be a pilot program when the law was amended to authorize use of the MOLST form as a non-hospital [[Do not resuscitate|DNR and DNI]] order statewide.<ref name="Laws of 2008">[http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/139342.pdf N.Y. laws of 2008, chapter 197]</ref>  In 2010, along with passage of the [[Family Health Care Decisions Act]], the legal authority for MOLST was moved from N.Y. Public Health Law Article 29-B to a new N.Y.

Under current law, the MOLST form can be used to issue a non-hospital [[Do not resuscitate|DNR and DNI]] order in New York State, and those orders must be honored by [[Emergency medical services in the United States|emergency medical services]] personnel, [[home care]] services personnel, [[Hospice care in the United States|hospice]] personnel and [[Emergency department|hospital emergency]] services personnel.<ref name="2994-bb">[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=$$PBH2994-BB$$@TXPBH02994-BB+&LIST=LAW+&BROWSER=BROWSER+&TOKEN=29103042+&TARGET=VIEW N.Y.

Coverage for an initial preventive physical examination under Medicare Part B includes verbal or written information regarding a patient's ability to prepare a MOLST form and the physician's willingness to issue orders on a MOLST form.<ref name="Medicare laws">[42 U.S.C. section 1395x(ww)]</ref>

New York Public Health Law section 2997-c requires the "attending health care practitioner" to offer to provide patients with a terminal illness with information and counseling regarding palliative care and end-of-life options appropriate to the patient.<ref name="DOH website 2">[http://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/patients/patient_rights/palliative_care/information_act.htm New York State Department of Health Palliative Care Information Act web page]</ref>
