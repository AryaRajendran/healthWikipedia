'''Acute myeloid leukemia''' ('''AML'''), also known as '''acute myelogenous leukemia''' or '''acute nonlymphocytic leukemia''' ('''ANLL'''), is a [[cancer]] of the [[myeloid]] line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal [[white blood cell]]s that accumulate in the [[bone marrow]] and interfere with [[haematopoiesis|the production of normal blood cells]]. AML is the most common [[acute leukemia]] affecting adults, and its [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] increases with age. Although AML is a relatively [[rare disease]], accounting for approximately 1.2% of cancer deaths in the United States,<ref name="cancerstats">{{cite journal |author=Jemal A, Thomas A, Murray T, Thun M |title=Cancer statistics, 2002 |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=23–47 |year=2002 |pmid=11814064 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.52.1.23/full |doi=10.3322/canjclin.52.1.23}}</ref> its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages.

The symptoms of AML are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in [[red blood cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several [[risk factors]] and [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]] have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.

AML has several subtypes; treatment and prognosis varies among subtypes. Five-year survival varies from 15–70%, and relapse rate varies from 33–78%, depending on subtype. AML is treated initially with [[chemotherapy]] aimed at inducing a [[remission (medicine)|remission]]; patients may go on to receive additional chemotherapy or a [[hematopoietic stem cell transplant]]. Recent research into the genetics of AML has resulted in the availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular patient, as well as how long that patient is likely to survive.

==Classification==
The two most commonly used classification schemata for AML are the older French-American-British (FAB) system and the newer [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) system.

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) classification of acute myeloid leukemia attempts to be more clinically useful and to produce more meaningful prognostic information than the FAB criteria. Each of the WHO categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories of interest to the [[hematopathologist]] and [[oncologist]]; however, most of the clinically significant information in the WHO schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below.

The WHO subtypes of AML are:<ref name=Vardiman/>

{| class="wikitable"

! [[ICD-O]]
|-
| '''Acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities'''
| Includes:

* AML with translocations between [[chromosome 8]] and 21 &#91;t(8;21)&#93; (ICD-O 9896/3); [[RUNX1]]/[[RUNX1T1]]
* AML with inversions in [[chromosome 16]] &#91;inv(16)&#93; (ICD-O 9871/3); [[CBFB]]/[[MYH11]]
* APL with translocations between [[chromosome 15]] and 17 &#91;t(15;17)&#93; (ICD-O 9866/3); [[Retinoic acid receptor alpha|RARA]];[[Promyelocytic leukemia protein|PML]]
* AML with translocations in chromosomes 9 and 11 [t(9;11)]; MLLT3-MLL

Patients with AML in this category generally have a high rate of remission and a better prognosis compared to other types of AML.
| Multiple
|-
| '''AML with multilineage dysplasia'''
| This category includes patients who have had a prior [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] (MDS) or [[myeloproliferative disease]] (MPD) that transforms into AML. This category of AML occurs most often in elderly patients and often has a worse prognosis.
| {{ICDO|9895|3}}
|-
| '''AML and MDS, therapy-related'''
| This category includes patients who have had prior chemotherapy and/or radiation and subsequently develop AML or MDS. These leukemias may be characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities, and often carry a worse prognosis.

|-
| '''AML not otherwise categorized'''
| Includes subtypes of AML that do not fall into the above categories.
| {{ICDO|9861|3}}
|}

Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (also known as mixed phenotype or [[biphenotypic acute leukemia]]) occur when the leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells, or where both types of cells are present.

===French-American-British===
The [[French-American-British classification|French-American-British (FAB) classification]] system divides AML into eight subtypes, M0 through to M7, based on the type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. This is done by examining the appearance of the [[Malignant|malignant cells]] with [[light microscopy]] and/or by using [[cytogenetics]] to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be more useful, the FAB system is still widely used.

Eight FAB subtypes were proposed in 1976.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bennett J, Catovsky D, Daniel M, Flandrin G, Galton D, Gralnick H, Sultan C | title = Proposals for the classification of the acute leukaemias.

The morphologic subtypes of AML also include rare types not included in the FAB system, such as [[acute basophilic leukemia]], which was proposed as a ninth subtype, M8, in 1999.<ref>{{cite journal| pmid=10037024 |author=Duchayne E, Demur C, Rubie H, Robert A, Dastugue N| title=Diagnosis of acute basophilic leukemia|journal=Leuk Lymphoma|year=1999 |volume=32|pages=269–78| issue=3–4| doi=10.3109/10428199909167387}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:AMLCase-66.jpg|thumb|Diffusely swollen gums due to infiltration by leukemic cells in a person with acute myelomonocytic leukemia]]
Most signs and symptoms of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes the patient susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity.<ref name="symptoms">{{cite book |last = Hoffman |first = Ronald |title= Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Churchill Livingstone|Elsevier Churchill Livingstone]] |location= [[St Louis, Missouri|St. Louis, Mo.]] |edition = 4th. |pages = 1074–75 |isbn= 0-443-06629-9 |display-authors = 1}}</ref> A drop in red blood cell count ([[anemia]]) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of [[platelet]]s can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.

The early signs of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be similar to those of [[influenza]] or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include [[fever]], [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[weight loss]] or [[loss of appetite]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, [[petechia]]e (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent [[infections]].<ref name = "symptoms"/>

[[Splenomegaly|Enlargement of the spleen]] may occur in AML, but it is typically mild and [[asymptomatic]]. [[lymphadenopathy|Lymph node swelling]] is rare in AML, in contrast to [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]. The skin is involved about 10% of the time in the form of [[chloroma|leukemia cutis]]. Rarely, [[Sweet's syndrome]], a [[paraneoplastic syndrome|paraneoplastic]] inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.<ref name = "symptoms"/>

Some patients with AML may experience swelling of the gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue. Rarely, the first sign of leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the [[bone marrow]], called a [[chloroma]]. Occasionally, a person may show [[asymptomatic|no symptoms]], and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine [[blood test]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Abeloff |first = Martin |title= Clinical Oncology |year= 2004 |publisher= [[Churchill Livingstone|Elsevier Churchill Livingstone]] |location= [[St Louis, Missouri|St. Louis, Mo.]] |edition = 3rd. |isbn= 0-443-06629-9 |page = 2834 |display-authors = 1}}</ref>

==Causes==
A number of risk factors for developing AML have been identified, including: other blood disorders, chemical exposures, ionizing radiation, and genetics.

===Preleukemia===
"Preleukemic" blood disorders, such as [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] or [[myeloproliferative disease]], can evolve into AML; the exact risk depends on the type of MDS/MPS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sanz G, Sanz M, Vallespí T, Cañizo M, Torrabadella M, García S, Irriguible D, San Miguel J | title = Two regression models and a scoring system for predicting survival and planning treatment in myelodysplastic syndromes: a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in 370 patients | journal = Blood | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 395–408 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2752119}}</ref>

===Chemical exposure===
Exposure to [[chemotherapy|anticancer chemotherapy]], in particular [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agents]], can increase the risk of subsequently developing AML. The risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Le Beau M, Albain K, Larson R, Vardiman J, Davis E, Blough R, Golomb H, Rowley J | title = Clinical and cytogenetic correlations in 63 patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia: further evidence for characteristic abnormalities of chromosomes no. 5 and 7 | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–45 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3950675}}</ref> Other chemotherapy agents, specifically [[Podophyllotoxin|epipodophyllotoxins]] and [[anthracycline]]s, have also been associated with treatment-related leukemia. These treatment-related leukemias are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thirman M, Gill H, Burnett R, Mbangkollo D, McCabe N, Kobayashi H, Ziemin-van der Poel S, Kaneko Y, Morgan R, Sandberg A | title = Rearrangement of the MLL gene in acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias with 11q23 chromosomal translocations | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 329 | issue = 13 | pages = 909–14 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8361504 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199309233291302}}</ref>

Occupational chemical exposure to [[benzene]] and other aromatic organic [[solvent]]s is controversial as a cause of AML. Benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be [[carcinogenic]] ''in vitro''. While some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of AML,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Austin H, Delzell E, Cole P | title = Benzene and leukemia. A review of the literature and a risk assessment | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 127 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–39 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3277397}}</ref> others have suggested the attributable risk, if any, is slight.<ref>Linet, MS. The Leukemias: Epidemiologic Aspects. [[Oxford University Press]], New York 1985.</ref>

===Radiation===
[[Ionizing radiation]] exposure can increase the risk of AML. Survivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] had an increased rate of AML,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM196605192742001 | author = Bizzozero O, Johnson K, Ciocco A | title = Radiation-related leukemia in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 1946–1964.

Distribution, incidence and appearance time | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 274 | issue = 20 | pages = 1095–101 | year = 1966 | pmid = 5932020}}</ref> as did [[radiologist]]s exposed to high levels of [[X-ray]]s prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yoshinaga S, Mabuchi K, Sigurdson A, Doody M, Ron E | title = Cancer risks among radiologists and radiologic technologists: review of epidemiologic studies | journal = Radiology | volume = 233 | issue = 2 | pages = 313–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15375227 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2332031119}}</ref>

===Genetics===
A hereditary risk for AML appears to exist. Multiple cases of AML developing in a family at a rate higher than predicted by chance alone have been reported.<ref>{{cite book|author=Taylor GM, Birch JM|chapter=The hereditary basis of human leukemia| editor=Henderson ES, Lister TA, Greaves MF| title=Leukemia|edition=6th|location=Philadelphia|publisher= WB Saunders|year= 1996|isbn=0-7216-5381-2|page=210}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Horwitz M, Goode EL, Jarvik GP |title=Anticipation in familial leukemia |journal=Am.

Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=517–24 |year=1969 |pmid=4180615 |doi=}}</ref>

Several [[congenital]] conditions may increase the risk of leukemia; the most common is probably [[Down syndrome]], which is associated with a 10- to 18-fold increase in the risk of AML.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans D, Steward J | title = Down's syndrome and leukaemia | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 7790 | pages = 1322 | year = 1972 | pmid = 4117858 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(72)92704-3}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Myeloblast with Auer rod smear 2010-01-27.JPG|thumb|right|Bone marrow: myeloblasts with Auer rods seen in acute myeloid leukemia]]
The first clue to a diagnosis of AML is typically an abnormal result on a [[complete blood count]]. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells ([[leukocytosis]]) is a common finding, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in [[platelet]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, or even with a ''low'' white blood cell count ([[leukopenia]]).<ref>Abeloff, Martin et al. (2004), p. 2834.</ref> While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made via examination of the [[Blood film|peripheral blood smear]] when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate [[bone marrow examination|bone marrow aspiration and biopsy]].

Marrow or blood is examined via [[light microscopy]], as well as [[flow cytometry]], to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease (see below). A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]] by routine [[cytogenetics]] or [[fluorescent in situ hybridization|fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization]]. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as [[FLT3]], [[nucleophosmin]], and [[CD117|KIT]], which may influence the outcome of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baldus CD, Mrózek K, Marcucci G, Bloomfield CD |title=Clinical outcome of de novo acute myeloid leukaemia patients with normal cytogenetics is affected by molecular genetic alterations: a concise review |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=137 |issue=5 |pages=387–400 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17488484 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06566.x |url=}}</ref>

Cytochemical stains on blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the distinction of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.<ref name=Vardiman>{{cite journal |author=Vardiman JW, Harris NL, Brunning RD |title=The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of the myeloid neoplasms |journal=Blood |volume=100 |issue=7 |pages=2292–302 |year=2002 |pmid=12239137 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-04-1199 | url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/100/7/2292}}</ref>

The diagnosis and classification of AML can be challenging, and should be performed by a qualified [[hematopathologist]] or [[hematologist]]. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as [[Auer rods]]) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, in the absence of such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.<ref>Abeloff, Martin et al. (2004), p. 2835.</ref>

According to the widely used [[WHO]] criteria, the diagnosis of AML is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20% of the blood and/or bone marrow by leukemic [[myeloblast]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harris N, Jaffe E, Diebold J, Flandrin G, Muller-Hermelink H, Vardiman J, Lister T, Bloomfield C | title = The World Health Organization classification of neoplastic diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Report of the Clinical Advisory Committee meeting, Airlie House, Virginia, November, 1997 | journal = Ann Oncol | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 1419–32 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10643532 | doi = 10.1023/A:1008375931236}}</ref> The French–American–British (FAB) classification is a bit more stringent, requiring a blast percentage of at least 30% in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) for the diagnosis of AML.<ref name=Amin2005>{{cite doi|10.1038/sj.leu.2403876}}</ref> AML must be carefully differentiated from "preleukemic" conditions such as [[myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplastic]] or [[myeloproliferative syndrome|myeloproliferative]] syndromes, which are treated differently.

Because [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]] (APL) has the highest curability and requires a unique form of treatment, it is important to quickly establish or exclude the diagnosis of this subtype of leukemia. Fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization performed on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose, as it readily identifies the [[chromosomal translocation]] (t&#91;15;17&#93;) that characterizes APL.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Grimwade D, Howe K, Langabeer S, Davies L, Oliver F, Walker H, Swirsky D, Wheatley K, Goldstone A, Burnett A, Solomon E | title = Establishing the presence of the t(15;17) in suspected acute promyelocytic leukaemia: cytogenetic, molecular and PML immunofluorescence assessment of patients entered into the M.R.C.

==Pathophysiology==
The malignant cell in AML is the [[myeloblast]]. In normal [[haematopoiesis|hematopoiesis]], the myeloblast is an immature precursor of [[myeloid]] white blood cells; a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell. In AML, though, a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which "freeze" the cell in its immature state and prevent [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fialkow PJ |title=Clonal origin of human tumors |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=458 |issue=3 |pages=283–321 |year=1976 |pmid=1067873 |doi=10.1016/0304-419X(76)90003-2}}</ref> Such a mutation alone does not cause leukemia; however, when such a "differentiation arrest" is [[Knudson hypothesis|combined with other mutations]] which disrupt genes controlling [[cell growth|proliferation]], the result is the uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells, leading to the clinical entity of AML.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fialkow PJ, Janssen JW, Bartram CR |title=Clonal remissions in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia: evidence for a multistep pathogenesis of the malignancy |journal=Blood |volume=77 |issue=7 |pages=1415–7 |date=1 April 1991|pmid=2009365 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/77/7/1415|format=PDF }}</ref>

Much of the diversity and heterogeneity of AML stems is because leukemic transformation can occur at a number of different steps along the differentiation pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bonnet D, Dick JE |title=Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell |journal=Nat. Med. |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=730–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9212098 |doi=10.1038/nm0797-730}}</ref> Modern classification schemes for AML recognize the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell (and the leukemia) may depend on the stage at which differentiation was halted.

Specific [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] abnormalities can be found in many patients with AML; the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have [[prognosis|prognostic]] significance.<ref>Abeloff, Martin et al. (2004), pp. 2831–32.</ref> The chromosomal [[translocations]] encode abnormal fusion [[proteins]], usually [[transcription factors]] whose altered properties may cause the "differentiation arrest".<ref>{{cite book|editor=Greer JP ''et al.''|title= Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology|edition=11th|location=Philadelphia|publisher= Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins|year= 2004|pages=2045–2062|isbn=0-7817-3650-1}}</ref> For example, in [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]], the t(15;17) translocation produces a PML-RARα [[fusion protein]] which binds to the [[retinoic acid]] receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid-specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Melnick A, Licht JD |title=Deconstructing a disease: RARα, its fusion partners, and their roles in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia |journal=Blood |volume=93 |issue=10 |pages=3167–215 |date=15 May 1999|pmid=10233871 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/93/10/3167 }}</ref>

The [[Medical sign|clinical signs]] and symptoms of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow.<ref>Abeloff, Martin et al. (2004), p. 2828.</ref> This leads to [[neutropenia]], [[anemia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]]. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, patients can develop a [[chloroma]], or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.<ref name="symptoms"/>

==Treatment==
First-line treatment of AML consists primarily of [[chemotherapy]], and is divided into two phases: '''induction''' and '''postremission''' (or '''consolidation''') therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure.<ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia-adult Acute myeloid leukemia] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]</ref> Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a patient relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for patients with high-risk disease.

===Induction===

===Consolidation===
Even after complete remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers too small to be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all patients will eventually relapse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cassileth PA |title=Maintenance chemotherapy prolongs remission duration in adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia |journal=J.

The specific type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a patient's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), patients will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mayer RJ |title=Intensive postremission chemotherapy in adults with acute myeloid leukemia.

For patients who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant, immunotherapy with a combination of histamine dihydrochloride ([[Ceplene]]) and [[interleukin 2]] (Proleukin) after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by 14%, translating to a 50% increase in the likelihood of maintained remission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brune M |title=Improved leukemia-free survival after postconsolidation immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride and interleukin-2 in acute myeloid leukemia: results of a randomized phase 3 trial |journal=Blood |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=88–96 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16556892 |doi=10.1182/blood-2005-10-4073 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/108/1/88 |author-separator=, |author2=Castaigne S |author3=Catalano J |display-authors=3 |last4=Gehlsen |first4=K |last5=Ho |first5=AD |last6=Hofmann |first6=WK |last7=Hogge |first7=DE |last8=Nilsson |first8=B |last9=Or |first9=R}}</ref>

===Relapsed AML===
For patients with relapsed AML, the only proven potentially curative therapy is a [[hematopoietic stem cell transplant]], if one has not already been performed.<ref name="relapse">Abeloff, Martin et al.

Since treatment options for relapsed AML are so limited, [[palliative care]] may be offered.

====Clinical trials====
Patients with relapsed AML who are not candidates for stem cell transplantion, or who have relapsed after a stem cell transplant, may be offered treatment in a [[clinical trial]], as conventional treatment options are limited. Agents under investigation include cytotoxic drugs such as [[clofarabine]], as well as [[targeted therapy|targeted therapies]], such as [[farnesyltransferase inhibitor|farnesyl transferase inhibitors]], decitabine, and inhibitors of MDR1 ([[Multidrug resistance|multidrug-resistance]] protein). 

====Relapsed APL====
For relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), [[arsenic trioxide]] has been tested in trials and approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]. Like ATRA, arsenic trioxide does not work with other subtypes of AML.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soignet SL |title=United States multicenter study of arsenic trioxide in relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia |journal=J.

==Prognosis==
[[Image:9;11.rhyax.jpg|thumb|right|Chromosomal translocation (9;11), associated with AML]]
Acute myeloid leukemia is a curable disease; the chance of cure for a specific patient depends on a number of prognostic factors.<ref name="prog">{{cite journal | author = Estey E | title = Prognostic factors in acute myelogenous leukemia | journal = Leukemia | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 670–2 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11368376 | doi = 10.1038/sj/leu/2402057}}</ref>

===Cytogenetics===
The single most important prognostic factor in AML is [[cytogenetics]], or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes (for example, the (15;17) translocation in [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]]). About half of AML patients have "normal" cytogenetics; they fall into an intermediate risk group. A number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wheatley K, Burnett A, Goldstone A, Gray R, Hann I, Harrison C, Rees J, Stevens R, Walker H | title = A simple, robust, validated and highly predictive index for the determination of risk-directed therapy in acute myeloid leukaemia derived from the MRC AML 10 trial.

===Myelodysplastic syndrome===
AML which arises from a pre-existing [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] or [[myeloproliferative disease]] (so-called secondary AML) has a worse [[prognosis]], as does treatment-related AML arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy.

==Epidemiology==
Acute myeloid leukemia is a relatively rare cancer. There are approximately 10,500 new cases each year in the United States, and the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rate has remained stable from 1995 through 2005. AML accounts for 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the United States.<ref name="cancerstats"/>

The incidence of AML increases with age; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years. AML accounts for about 90% of all acute leukemias in adults, but is rare in children.<ref name="cancerstats"/> The rate of ''therapy-related AML'' (that is, AML caused by previous chemotherapy) is rising; therapy-related disease currently accounts for about 10–20% of all cases of AML.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leone G, Mele L, Pulsoni A, Equitani F, Pagano L |title=The incidence of secondary leukemias |journal=Haematologica |volume=84 |issue=10 |pages=937–45 |date=1 October 1999|pmid=10509043 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/reprint/84/10/937 }}</ref> AML is slightly more common in men, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Greenlee RT, Hill-Harmon MB, Murray T, Thun M |title=Cancer statistics, 2001 |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=15–36 |year=2001 |pmid=11577478 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.51.1.15/full |doi=10.3322/canjclin.51.1.15}}</ref>

There is some geographic variation in the incidence of AML. In adults, the highest rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America.<ref>{{cite book |author=Linet MS |editor=Lilienfeld AM |title=Monographs in Epidemiology and Biostatistics |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503448-1 |chapter=The leukemias: Epidemiologic aspects. |page=I}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Aoki K|title=Death Rates for Malignant Neoplasms for Selected Sites by Sex and Five-Year Age Group in 33 Countries 1953–57 to 1983–87|location=Nagoya, Japan|publisher=University of Nagoya Press, International Union Against Cancer|year=1992|author-separator=,|author2=Kurihars M|author3=Hayakawa N|display-authors=3}}</ref> In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than in other parts of Asia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhatia S, Neglia JP |title=Epidemiology of childhood acute myelogenous leukemia |journal=J.

==History==
[[Image:Alfred Velpeau 01.JPG|right|thumb|Alfred Velpeau]]
The first published description of a case of leukemia in medical literature dates to 1827, when French physician [[Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau]] described a 63-year-old florist who developed an illness characterized by fever, weakness, [[nephrolithiasis|urinary stones]], and substantial [[hepatosplenomegaly|enlargement of the liver and spleen]]. Velpeau noted the blood of this patient had a consistency "like gruel", and speculated the appearance of the blood was due to white corpuscles.<ref>Hoffman ''et al.'' 2005, pg 1071</ref> In 1845, a series of patients who died with enlarged spleens and changes in the "colors and consistencies of their blood" was reported by the [[Edinburgh]]-based [[pathologist]] J.H. Bennett; he used the term "leucocythemia" to describe this pathological condition.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bennett JH| title=Two cases of hypertrophy of the spleen and liver, in which death took place from suppuration of blood |journal=Edinburgh Med Surg J| year=1845| volume=64| pages=413}}</ref>

The term "leukemia" was coined by [[Rudolf Virchow]], the renowned German [[pathologist]], in 1856. As a pioneer in the use of the [[light microscope]] in pathology, Virchow was the first to describe the abnormal excess of white blood cells in patients with the clinical syndrome described by Velpeau and Bennett. As Virchow was uncertain of the [[etiology]] of the white blood cell excess, he used the purely descriptive term "leukemia" (Greek: "white blood") to refer to the condition.<ref>{{cite book |last= Virchow|first=R|editor=Virchow R|title=Gesammelte Abhandlungen zur Wissenschaftlichen Medizin|year=1856 |publisher=Meidinger| location=Frankfurt |language=German |chapter=Die Leukämie|page=190}}</ref>

Further advances in the understanding of acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with the development of new technology. In 1877, [[Paul Ehrlich]] developed a technique of [[staining (biology)|staining]] blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells. [[Wilhelm Ebstein]] introduced the term "acute leukemia" in 1889 to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from the more indolent [[chronic leukemia]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ebstein W|title=Über die acute Leukämie und Pseudoleukämie|journal=Deutsch Arch Klin Med|year=1889|volume=44|pages=343}}</ref> The term "myeloid" was coined by [[Franz Ernst Christian Neumann]] in 1869, as he was the first to recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: µυєλός, ''myelos'' = (bone) marrow) as opposed to the [[spleen]]. The technique of [[bone marrow examination]] to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by Mosler.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mosler F|title=Klinische Symptome und Therapie der medullären Leukämie|journal=Berl Klin Wochenschr|year=1876|volume=13|pages=702}}</ref> Finally, in 1900, the [[myeloblast]], which is the malignant cell in AML, was characterized by [[Otto Naegeli]], who divided the leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Naegeli O|title=Über rothes Knochenmark und Myeloblasten|journal=Deutsch Med Wochenschr|year=1900|volume=26|pages=287|doi=10.1055/s-0029-1203820|issue=18}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Zhen-yi, Wang |title = Ham-Wasserman Lecture: Treatment of Acute Leukemia by Inducing Differentiation and Apoptosis | year=2003 | journal = Hematology | pmid = 14633774|url=http://asheducationbook.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/2003/1/1 |doi = 10.1182/asheducation-2003.1.1 | volume = 2003 | pages = 1–13 | issue=1}}</ref>

In 2008, AML became the first cancer genome to be fully [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]]. DNA extracted from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ley TJ |title= DNA sequencing of a cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia genome |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=66–72 |year=2008 |pmid=18987736 |doi=10.1038/nature07485| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7218/abs/nature07485.html |pmc=2603574|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...66L |author-separator=, |author2=Mardis ER |author3=Ding L |display-authors=3 |last4=Fulton |first4=Bob |last5=McLellan |first5=Michael D. |last6=Chen |first6=Ken |last7=Dooling |first7=David |last8=Dunford-Shore |first8=Brian H. |last9=McGrath |first9=Sean }}</ref> The leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with the disease.

==In pregnancy==
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.<ref name=Shapira />  How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.  Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of [[pregnancy loss]] and [[birth defect]]s, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive [[first trimester]].<ref name=Shapira>{{cite journal
