'''Bacterial pneumonia''' is a type of [[pneumonia]] caused by [[bacterial infection]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000084151|bacterial pneumonia}}</ref>

==Sign and symptoms==
*[[Fever]]
*[[Rigors]]
*[[Cough]]
*[[rhinorrhea|Runny nose]]
*[[Dyspnea]] - shortness of breath
*[[Chest pain]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Bacterial Pneumonia |page=2 |work=Lung Disease & Respiratory Health Center |publisher=WebMD |url=http://www.webmd.com/lung/bacterial-pneumonia?page=2}}</ref>

==Types==
===Gram-positive===
''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' ({{ICD10|J|13||j|09}}) is the most common [[bacteria]]l cause of pneumonia in all age groups except newborn infants. ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' is a [[Gram-positive]] bacterium that often lives in the throat of people who do not have pneumonia. 

Other important Gram-positive causes of pneumonia are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ({{ICD10|J|15|2|j|09}}) and ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.

===Gram-negative===
[[Gram-negative bacteria]] are seen less frequently: ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' ({{ICD10|J|14||j|09}}), ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' ({{ICD10|J|15|0|j|09}}), ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' ({{ICD10|J|15|5|j|09}}), ''[[Pseudomonas|Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' ({{ICD10|J|15|1|j|09}}), ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]'' are the most common. 

These bacteria often live in the [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] and enter the lungs when contents of the gut (such as vomit or faeces) are inhaled.

===Atypical===
"[[Atypical pneumonia|Atypical]]" bacteria are ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'' ({{ICD10|J|16|0|j|09}}), ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' ({{ICD10|J|15|7|j|09}}), and ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]''. 

Many people falsely believe they are called "atypical" because they are uncommon and/or do not respond to common antibiotics and/or cause atypical symptoms. In reality, they are "atypical" because they do not gram stain as well as gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.  

Pneumonia caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' is usually called [[pneumonic plague]].

== Pathophysiology ==
Bacteria typically enter the [[lung]] with inhalation, though they can reach the lung through the bloodstream if other parts of the body are infected. Often, [[bacteria]] live in parts of the [[upper respiratory tract]] and are continuously being inhaled into the alveoli. Once inside the alveoli, [[bacteria]] travel into the spaces between the cells and also between adjacent alveoli through connecting pores. This invasion triggers the [[immune system]] to respond by sending white blood cells responsible for attacking microorganisms ([[neutrophil]]s) to the lungs. The neutrophils [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and kill the offending organisms but also release cytokines that result in a general activation of the immune system. This results in the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial and fungal pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid leaked from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli and result in impaired oxygen transportation. 

Bacteria often travel from the lung into the blood stream and can result in serious illness such as [[septic shock]], in which there is low blood pressure leading to damage in multiple parts of the body including the [[brain]], [[kidney]], and [[heart]]. They can also travel to the area between the lungs and the chest wall, called the [[pleural cavity]].

== Treatment ==
[[Antibiotic]]s are the treatment of choice for bacterial pneumonia and ventilation (oxygen supplement) as supportive therapy. The antibiotic choice depends on the nature of the pneumonia, the microorganisms most commonly causing pneumonia in the geographical region, and the immune status and underlying health of the individual. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[amoxicillin]] is used as first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients acquiring pneumonia in the community, sometimes with added [[clarithromycin]]. In [[North America]], where the "atypical" forms of community-acquired pneumonia are becoming more common, [[clarithromycin]], [[azithromycin]], or [[fluoroquinolones]] as single therapy, have displaced the amoxicillin as first-line therapy. 
Local patterns of antibiotic-resistance should always be considered when initiating pharmacotherapy. In hospitalized individuals or those with immune deficiencies, local guidelines determine the selection of antibiotics. These antibiotics are typically given through an [[intravenous]] line.

===Gram-positive organisms===
''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' — amoxicillin (or [[erythromycin]] in patients allergic to penicillin); cefuroxime and erythromycin in severe cases.
''Staphylococcus aureus'' — [[flucloxacillin]] (to counteract the organism's β-lactamase).

===Gram-negative organisms===
*''Haemophilus influenzae'' — doxycycline
*''Klebsiella pneumoniae''
*''Escherichia coli''
*''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' — ciprofloxacin
*''Moraxella catarrhalis''

===Atypical organisms===
*''Chlamydophila pneumoniae'' — doxycycline
*''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'' — erythromycin
*''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' — erythromycin
*''Coxiella burnetti'' — erythromycin
*''Legionella pneumophila'' — erythromycin, with [[rifampicin]] sometimes added.

People who have difficulty breathing due to pneumonia may require extra [[oxygen]]. An extremely sick individual may require [[artificial ventilation]] and [[intensive care medicine|intensive care]] as life-saving measures while his or her immune system fights off the infectious cause with the help of antibiotics and other drugs.

==Prevention==
Prevention of bacterial pneumonia is by vaccination against [[pneumococcal vaccine|streptococcus pneumoniae]] ([[pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine]] for adults and [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]] for children), [[Hib vaccine|Haemophilus influenzae type B]], [[Meningococcal vaccine|meningococcus]], [[pertussis vaccine|bordetella pertussis]], [[anthrax vaccines|bacillus anthracis]], and [[Plague vaccine|yersinia pestis]].
