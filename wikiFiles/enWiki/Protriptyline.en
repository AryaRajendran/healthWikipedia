'''Protriptyline''' ('''Vivactil''') is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA), specifically a [[secondary amine]], indicated for the treatment of [[major depression|depression]] and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]]. Unique among the TCAs, protriptyline tends to be [[stimulant|energizing]] instead of [[sedative|sedating]], and is sometimes used for [[narcolepsy]] to achieve a [[wakefulness-promoting agent|wakefulness-promoting]] effect.

TCAs including protriptyline are also used to reduce the incidence of recurring headaches such as migraine, and for other types of chronic pain. This drug can also be used for sleep apnea treatment along with a [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]].

Its sale was discontinued in the UK, Australia, and Republic of Ireland in 2000.<ref>http://www.choiceandmedication.org/nsft/medications/92/</ref>

==Purpose==
 
Protriptyline is used primarily to treat [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and to treat the combination of symptoms of [[anxiety]] and depression.<ref name=DURAMED>DURAMED PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., . (Ed.). (2007). Protriptyline drug facts. Pomona, New York : Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</ref>Like most [[antidepressants]] of this chemical and pharmacological class, protriptyline has also been used in limited numbers of patients to treat [[panic disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]], [[enuresis]],eating disorders such as [[bulimia nervosa]], cocaine dependency, and the depressive phase of [[bipolar disorder]] (manic-depressive) disorder. It has also been used to support smoking cessation programs.<ref name=ULTRAM>ULTRAM, . (Ed.). (2007). Protriptyline. Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc.</ref>

==Description==

Protriptyline hydrochloride, a [[dibenzocycloheptene]] derivative, has a molecular weight of 299.84.<ref name=DURAMED/> It is a white to yellowish powder that is freely soluble in water and soluble in dilute HCl. Protriptyline hydrochloride is supplied as 5&nbsp;mg or 10&nbsp;mg tablets.<ref name=DURAMED/> Inactive ingredients are [[anhydrous lactose]], [[colloidal silicon dioxide]], [[magnesium stearate]], and [[microcrystalline cellulose]].<ref name=ULTRAM/>

==Mechanism of action==

Protriptyline acts by decreasing the reuptake of [[norepinephrine]] and to a lesser extent [[serotonin]] (5-HT) in the brain.<ref name=Advameg>Advameg, Inc. (2010). [http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Protriptyline.html Protriptyline] at MindDisorders.com </ref> [[Tricyclic antidepressants]] act to change the balance of naturally occurring chemicals in the brain that regulate the transmission of [[nerve impulses]] between cells. Protriptyline increases the concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin (both chemicals that stimulate nerve cells) and, to a lesser extent, blocks the action of another brain chemical, [[acetylcholine]].<ref name= Advameg /> The therapeutic effects of protriptyline, like other antidepressants, appear slowly. Maximum benefit is often not evident for at least two weeks after starting the drug.<ref name= Advameg />

Protriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant.<ref name=AHFS>American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. ''AHFS Drug Information 2002''. Bethesda: American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, 2002.</ref> It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by [[Reuptake inhibitor|inhibiting]] the re-uptake of the [[neurotransmitters]] norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells.<ref name=AHFS/> However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks.<ref name=AHFS/> It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the [[cerebral cortex]] and [[hippocampus]].<ref name=AHFS/> The hippocampus is part of the [[limbic system]], a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production).<ref name=AHFS/> Tricyclics are also known as effective [[analgesics]] for different types of pain, especially [[neuropathic]] or [[neuralgia|neuralgic]] pain.<ref name=AHFS/> A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain [[opioid]] systems in the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] via an indirect [[serotonergic]] route. They are also effective in migraine [[prophylaxis]], but not in abortion of acute migraine attack.<ref name=AHFS/> The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic.<ref name=AHFS/>

==Withdrawal==

Though not indicative of addiction, [[withdrawal|abrupt cessation]] of treatment after prolonged therapy may produce nausea, headache, and [[malaise]].<ref name=Advameg/>

==Recommended dosage==
 
Protriptyline is available as 5-mg and 10-mg tablets.<ref name=AHFS/> Doses range from 15 to 40&nbsp;mg per day and can be taken in one daily dose or divided into up to four doses daily.<ref name=AHFS/> Some people with severe depression may require up to 60&nbsp;mg per day.<ref name=AHFS/> 
In adolescents and people over age 60, therapy should be initiated at a dose of 5&nbsp;mg three times a day and increased under supervision of a physician as needed.<ref name=AHFS/> Patients over age 60 who are taking daily doses of 20&nbsp;mg or more should be closely monitored for side effects such as rapid heart rate and [[urinary retention]].<ref name=AHFS/>

==Precautions==
 
Like all tricyclic antidepressants, protriptyline should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have [[benign prostatic hypertrophy]] (enlarged prostate gland), urinary retention, and [[glaucoma]], especially [[angle-closure glaucoma]] (the most severe form). Before starting treatment, people with these conditions should discuss the relative risks and benefits of treatment with their doctors to help determine if protriptyline is the right antidepressant for them.<ref name=Kirchheiner04>{{cite journal |author=Kirchheiner J, Nickchen K, Bauer M, ''et al.'' |title=Pharmacogenetics of antidepressants and antipsychotics: the contribution of allelic variations to the phenotype of drug response |journal=Mol. Psychiatry |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=442–73 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15037866 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001494 }}</ref> 
A common problem with tricyclic antidepressants is [[sedation]] (drowsiness, lack of physical and mental alertness).<ref name=Kirchheiner04/> This side effect is especially noticeable early in therapy.<ref name=Kirchheiner04/> In most people, sedation decreases or disappears entirely with time, but, until then, patients taking protriptyline should not perform hazardous activities requiring mental alertness or coordination.<ref name=DeVane90>DeVane, C. Lindsay, Pharm.D. "Drug Therapy for Mood Disorders." In Fundamentals of Monitoring Psychoactive Drug Therapy. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 1990.</ref> The sedative effect is increased when protriptyline is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or [[antihistamines]].<ref name=DeVane90/> It may be dangerous to take protriptyline in combination with these substances.<ref name=DeVane90/> Protriptyline may increase the possibility of having seizures.<ref name=DeVane90/> 

Protriptyline may increase heart rate and stress on the heart.<ref name=Advameg/> It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class.<ref name=Advameg/> In rare cases in which patients with cardiovascular disease must take protriptyline, they should be monitored closely for cardiac rhythm disturbances and signs of cardiac stress or damage.<ref name=Advameg/> 
When Protriptyline is used to treat the depressive component of [[schizophrenia]], psychotic symptoms may be aggravated. Likewise, in [[manic-depressive]] psychosis, depressed patients may experience a shift toward the manic phase if they are treated with an antidepressant drug. Paranoid delusions, with or without associated hostility, may be exaggerated.<ref name=AHFS/> In any of these circumstances, it may be advisable to reduce the dose of Protriptyline or to use a [[antipsychotic| major tranquilizing]] drug concurrently.<ref name=AHFS/>

==Side effects==
 
Protriptyline shares side effects common to all tricyclic antidepressants.<ref name=DURAMED/> The most frequent of these are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness,  decreased coordination, anxiety, blood disorders, confusion, decreased libido, dizziness, flushing, headache, impotence, insomnia, low blood pressure, nightmares, rapid or irregular heartbeat, rash, seizures, sensitivity to sunlight, stomach and intestinal problems.<ref name=AHFS/> Other more complicated side effects include; chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; [[hallucinations]], or [[seizure]] (convulsions); easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness; restless muscle movements in your eyes, tongue, jaw, or neck; urinating less than usual or not at all; extreme thirst with headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness; or feeling light-headed or fainting.<ref name=AHFS/>
 
Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug.<ref name=DURAMED/> Patients may also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless candy in order to increase the flow of saliva. Some artificial saliva products may give temporary relief.<ref name=DURAMED/> 
Men with prostate enlargement who take protriptyline may be especially likely to have problems with urinary retention.<ref name=AHFS/> Symptoms include having difficulty starting a urine flow and more difficulty than usual passing urine.<ref name=AHFS/> In most cases, urinary retention is managed with dose reduction or by switching to another type of antidepressant.<ref name=AHFS/> In extreme cases, patients may require treatment with bethanechol, a drug that reverses this particular side effect.<ref name=AHFS/>

==Overdosage==

Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs.<ref name=DeVane90/> Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate [[tricyclic antidepressant overdose]].<ref name=DeVane90/> As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment.<ref name=DURAMED/> Signs and symptoms of toxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible.<ref name=DeVane90/>
Critical manifestations of overdosage include: [[cardiac dysrhythmias]], [[hypotension|severe hypotension]], convulsions, and CNS depression, including coma.<ref name=AHFS/> Changes in the electrocardiogram, particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.<ref name=AHFS/>
Other signs of overdose may include: confusion, disturbed concentration, transient visual hallucinations, dilated pupils, agitation, hyperactive reflexes, [[stupor]], drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, [[hypothermia]], [[hyperpyrexia]].<ref name=AHFS/>

==Metabolism==

Metabolic studies indicate that Protriptyline is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly sequestered in tissues.<ref name=DURAMED/> Relatively low plasma levels are found after administration, and only a small amount of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine of dogs and rabbits.<ref name=DURAMED/> Preliminary studies indicate that demethylation of the secondary amine moiety occurs to a significant extent, and that metabolic transformation probably takes place in the liver.<ref name=DURAMED/> It penetrates the brain rapidly in mice and rats, and moreover that which is present in the brain is almost all unchanged drug.<ref name=DURAMED/>
Studies on the disposition of radioactive Protriptyline in human test subjects showed significant plasma levels within 2 hours, peaking at 8 to 12 hours, then declining gradually.<ref name=DURAMED/>
Urinary excretion studies in the same subjects showed significant amounts of radioactivity in 2 hours.<ref name=DURAMED/> The rate of excretion was slow.<ref name=DURAMED/> Cumulative urinary excretion during 16 days accounted for approximately 50% of the drug. The fecal route of excretion did not seem to be important.<ref name=DURAMED/>
