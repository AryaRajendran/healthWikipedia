'''Adhesins''' are cell-surface components or appendages of bacteria that facilitate [[adhesion|bacterial adhesion]] or [[adherence (compliance) and concordance|adherence]] to other cells or to inanimate surfaces. Adhesins are a type of [[virulence factor]].

'''Adherence''' is an essential step in [[bacteria]]l [[pathogenesis]] or [[infection]], required for [[colonizing]] a new [[host (biology)|host]].<ref name=Coutte_2003>{{cite journal |author=Coutte L, Alonso S, Reveneau N, Willery E, Quatannens B, Locht C, Jacob-Dubuisson F |title=Role of adhesin release for mucosal colonization by a bacterial pathogen |journal=J Exp Med |volume=197 |issue=6 |pages=735–42 |year=2003 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/197/6/735 |pmid=12629063 |doi=10.1084/jem.20021153}}</ref>

==Background==

[[Bacteria]] are typically found attached to and living in close association with surfaces. During the bacterial lifespan, a bacterium is subjected to frequent [[shear stress|shear-forces]]. In the crudest sense, bacterial adhesins serve as anchors allowing bacteria to overcome these environmental shear forces, thus remaining in their desired environment. However, bacterial adhesins do not serve as a sort of universal bacterial Velcro. Rather, they act as specific surface recognition molecules, allowing the targeting of a particular bacterium to a particular surface such as root tissue in plants, lacrimal duct tissues in mammals, or even tooth enamel.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000>{{cite journal |author=Per Klemm, Mark A. Schembri |title=Bacterial adhesins: function and structure |journal=International Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=290 |issue=1 |pages=27–35 |year=2000 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438422100801022}}</ref>

Most [[fimbria (bacteriology)|fimbria]] of [[gram-negative]] bacteria function as adhesins, but in many cases it is a minor subunit [[protein]] at the tip of the fimbriae that is the actual adhesin. In gram-positive bacteria, a protein or [[polysaccharide]] surface layer serves as the specific adhesin. To effectively achieve adherence to host surfaces, many bacteria produce multiple adherence factors called '''adhesins'''.

Bacterial adhesins provide species and tissue [[tropism]]. Adhesins are expressed by both [[pathogenic|pathogenic bacteria]] and [[saprophytic|saprophytic bacteria]]. This prevalence marks them as key microbial [[virulence factor | virulence factors]] in addition to a bacterium’s ability to produce toxins and resist the immune defenses of the host.

==Structures== 
Through the mechanisms of evolution, different species of bacteria have developed different solutions to the problem of attaching receptor specific proteins to the bacteria surface. Today many different types and subclasses of bacterial adhesins may be observed in the literature. 

The typical structure of a bacterial adhesion is that of a [[fimbria (bacteriology)|fimbria]] or [[pilus|pili]].<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref> The bacterial adhesion consists primarily of an intramembranous structural protein which provides a scaffold upon which several extracellular adhesins may be attached.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref> However, as in the case of the CFA1 fimbriae, the structural protein itself can sometimes act as an adhesion if a portion of the protein extends into the [[extra cellular matrix|ECM]].

===FimH Adhesin - Structure===
The best characterized bacterial adhesin is the type 1 fimbrial FimH adhesin. This adhesin is responsible for [[mannose|D-mannose]] sensitive adhesion.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref> The bacterium synthesizes a precursor protein consisting of 300 [[amino acid|amino acids]] then processes the protein by removing several signal peptides ultimately leaving a 279 amino acid protein.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref> Mature FimH is displayed on the bacterial surface as a component of the type 1 fimbrial organelle.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref>

In 1999, the structure of FimH was resolved via [[x-ray crystallography]]. FimH is folded into two domains. The N terminal adhesive domain plays the main role in surface recognition while the C-terminal domain is responsible for organelle integration.<ref name=Choudhury>{{cite journal |author=Choudhury, D., Thompson, A., Stojanoff, V., Langermann,S., Pinker, J., Hultgren, S. ]., Knight, S. D |title=X-ray structure of the FimC-FimHchaperone-adhesin complex from uropathogenic ''Escherichia coli'' |journal=Science |volume=285 |issue=1 |pages=1061–66 |year=1999}}</ref> A [[turn (biochemistry)| tetra-peptide loop]] links the two domains. Additionally, a carbohydrate-binding pocket has been identified at the tip of the N-terminal adhesive domain.<ref name=Choudhury></ref> This basic structure is conserved across type 1 fimbrial adhesins though recent studies have shown that in vitro induced mutations can lead to the addition of C-terminal domain specificity resulting in a bacterial adhesion with dual bending sites and related binding phenotypes.<ref name=Schembri>{{cite journal |author=Schembri, M. A., Klemm, P|title=Heterobinary ildhesins based on the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' FimH fimbrial protein|journal=Applied Environmental Microbiology |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=1628–33 |year=1998}}</ref>

==Adhesins as Virulence Factors==
The majority of bacterial pathogens exploit specific adhesion to host cells as their main [[virulence factor]]. “A large number of bacterial adhesins with individual receptor specificities have been identified.”<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref> Many bacterial pathogens are able to express an array of different adhesins. Expression of these adhesins at different phases during [[infection]] play the most important role in adhesion based virulence.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref> Numerous studies have shown that inhibiting a single adhesin in this coordinated effort can often be enough to make a pathogenic bacterium [[virulence|non-virulent]]. This has led to the exploration of adhesin activity interruption as a method of bacterial infection treatment.

==Vaccines based on Adhesins==
The study of adhesins as a point of exploitation for [[vaccine|vaccines]] comes from early studies which indicated that an important component of protective immunity against certain bacteria came from an ability to prevent adhesin binding.<ref name=Levine>{{cite journal |author=Levine, M. M., Giron, J. A., Noriega, E R|title=Fimbrial vaccines. |journal=Fimbriae, adhesion, genetics, biogenesis, and vaccines |pages=255–270 |year=1994}}</ref> Additionally, Adhesins are attractive [[vaccine]] candidates because they are often essential to infection and are surface-located, making them readily accessible to [[antibody|antibodies]].

The effectiveness of anti-adhesin [[antibody|antibodies]] is illustrated by studies with FimH, the adhesin of uropathogenic ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (UPEC).Work with E. coli stems from observations of human acquired immunity. Children in third world countries may suffer from several episodes of E. coli associated [[diarrhea]] during the first three years of life. If the child survives this initial period of susceptibility, infection rates typically drop substantially. Field studies show that this [[adaptive immune system|acquired immunity]] is directed primarily against bacterial adhesins.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref>    

Recent studies from Worchester Polytechnic institute show that the consumption of [[cranberry juice|cranberry juice cocktail]] may inhibit the action of UPEC adhesins. Using [[atomic force microscopy]] researchers have shown that adhesion forces decrease with time following [[cranberry juice|cranberry juice cocktail]] consumption. <ref name="Camesano">{{cite journal | author = Camesano A.T, Howell A.B., Pinzon-Arango P.A., Tao Y.| title = Oral consumption of cranberry juice cocktail inhibits molecular scale adhesion of clinical uropathogenic Escherichia coli| journal = Journal of Medicinal Food | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–8 | year = 2011}}</ref> This type of research has opened the door to further exploration of orally administered vaccines which exploit bacterial adhesins. 

A number of problems create challenges for the researcher exploring the anti-adhesin immunity concept. First and foremost among these problems is the large number of different bacterial adhesins which target the same human tissues. Further problems arise when considering an individual bacterium’s ability to produce multiple different types of adhesins most of which are produced at different times, in different places, and in response to different environmental triggers.<ref name=Per_Klem_2000></ref> Finally, the most pressing problem becomes evident when considering that many adhesins present as different immunologically distinct antigentic varieties, even within the same [[clone (cell biology)|clone]] (as is the case in ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'').<ref name=Davies>{{cite journal |author=Davies, J. K., Koomey, J. M., Seifert, H. S|title=Pili (fimbriae) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae |journal=Fimbriae, adhesion, genetics, biogenesis, and vaccines |pages=147–155 |year=1994}}</ref>

Despite these challenges, progress is being made in the creation of anti-adhesion vaccines.  In animal models, [[passive immunization]] with anti FimH-antibodies and vaccination with the [[protein]] significantly reduced colonization by UPEC.<ref name=Langermann_2000>{{cite journal |author=Langermann S, Möllby R, Burlein J, Palaszynski S, Auguste C, DeFusco A, Strouse R, Schenerman M, Hultgren S, Pinkner J, Winberg J, Guldevall L, Söderhäll M, Ishikawa K, Normark S, Koenig S |title=Vaccination with FimH adhesin protects cynomolgus monkeys from colonization and infection by uropathogenic Escherichia coli |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=181 |issue=2 |pages=774–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10669375 |doi=10.1086/315258}}</ref> Moreover, the ''Bordetella pertussis'' adhesins FHA and pertactin are components of 3 of the 4 acellular pertussis vaccines currently licensed for use in the U.S. Additionally, anti-adhesion vaccines are being explored as a solution to [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections] (UTIs). The use of synthetic FimH adhesion peptides was shown to prevent urogenital mucosal infection by ''[Eschericia Coli|E. coli]]'' in mice.<ref name=Langermann>{{cite journal |author=Langermann, S., Palaszynsky, S., Barnhart, M., Auguste, G., Pinkner, J.

High survival of [[granulocyte|polymorphonuclear neutrophils]] (PMNs) characterizes ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' infections.
