'''Vitreous hemorrhage''' is the [[extravasation]], or leakage, of blood into the areas in and around the [[vitreous humor]] of the [[Human eye|eye]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230216-overview Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] and the [[retina]] of the eye. A variety of conditions can result in blood leaking into the vitreous humor, which can cause impaired vision, [[floater]]s, and [[photopsia]].<ref name="ebsco1"/>

==Causes==
There are many factors known to cause vitreous hemorrhage.

===Diabetic retinopathy===
The most common cause found in adults is [[diabetic retinopathy]]. Abnormal blood vessels can form in the back of the eye of a person with diabetes. These new blood vessels are weaker and prone to breaking and causing hemorrhage.<ref name = "ebsco1">Garibaldi, Daniel. "Vitreous Hemorrhage." CRS - Eye Advisor (2010): 1. Health Source - Consumer Edition. Web. 29 Nov. 2011.</ref> Diabetic retinopathy accounts for 31.5-54% of all cases of vitreous hemorrhage in adults in the United States.<ref name = "emedcauses">[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230216-overview#a0199 Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Trauma===
Some injuries can cause blood vessels in the back of the eye to bleed. [[Trauma (medical)|Trauma]] is the leading cause of vitreous hemorrhage in young people, and accounts for 12–18.8% of cases in adults.<ref name="emedcauses"/>

===Retinal tear or detachment===
A tear in the [[retina]] can allow fluids from the eye to leak in behind the retina, which causes retinal detachment. When this occurs, blood from the retinal blood vessels can bleed into the vitreous.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001027.htm Retinal detachment: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Retinal tear]] accounts for 11.4–44% of vitreous hemorrhage cases.<ref name="emedcauses"/>

===Posterior vitreous detachment===
As one gets older, pockets of fluid can develop in the vitreous. When these pockets develop near the back of the eye, the vitreous can pull away from the retina and possibly tear it.<ref name ="ebsco1"/> Posterior [[vitreous detachment]] accounts for 3.7–11.7% of vitreous hemorrhage cases.<ref name="emedcauses"/>

===Other causes===
Less common causes of vitreous hemorrhage make up 6.4–18% of cases, and include:
*'''Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy'''
*'''Macroaneurysm'''
*'''Age-related [[macular degeneration]]'''
*'''[[Terson syndrome]]'''
*'''Retinal [[neovascularization]] as a result of branch or central retinal vein occlusion'''
*'''Other''' – about 7 cases in 100,000 have no known cause attributed to them.<ref name="emedcauses"/>

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Common symptoms of vitreous hemorrhage include:
*'''Blurry vision'''
*'''[[Floaters]]'''- faint cobweb-like apparitions floating through the field of vision
*'''Reddish tint to vision'''
*'''[[Photopsia]]''' – brief flashes of light in the peripheral vision<ref name="ebsco1"/>

Small vitreous hemorrhage often manifests itself as "floaters". A moderate case will often result in dark streaks in the vision, while dense vitreous hemorrhage can significantly inhibit vision.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230216-clinical Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Vitreous hemorrhage is diagnosed by identifying symptoms, examining the eye, and performing tests to identify cause. Some common tests include:
*Examination of the eye with a microscope
*[[Mydriasis|Pupil dilation]] and examination
*An [[ultrasound]] examination may be used if the doctor does not have a clear view of the back of the eye
*Blood tests to check for specific causes such as diabetes
*A [[CT scan]] to check for injury around the eye
*Referral to a retinal specialist<ref name="ebsco1"/>

==Treatments==
The treatment method used depends on the cause of the hemorrhage. In most cases, the patient is advised to rest with the head elevated 30–45°, and sometimes to put patches over the eyes to limit movement prior to treatment in order to allow the blood to settle. The patient is also advised to avoid taking medications that cause blood thinning (such as [[aspirin]] or similar medications). 

The goal of the treatment is to fix the cause of the hemorrhage as quickly as possible. Retinal tears are closed by [[Refractive surgery|Laser treatment]] or [[cryotherapy]], and detached retinas are reattached surgically.<ref name ="emedtreat">[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230216-treatment#showall Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Even after treatment, it can take months for the body to clear all of the blood from the vitreous.<ref name ="ebsco1"/> In cases of vitreous hemorrhage due to detached retina,long-standing vitreous hemorrhage with a duration of more than 2–3 months, or cases associated with [[rubeosis iridis]] or [[glaucoma]], a [[vitrectomy]] may be necessary to remove the standing blood in the vitreous.
