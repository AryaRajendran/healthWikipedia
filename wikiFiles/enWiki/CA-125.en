Prognosis relates to both the initial and post-treatment CA-125 values. A preoperative value >65 U/mL suggests a poor prognosis.  Persistent elevations following chemotherapy indicate a poor prognosis.  The half-life of CA-125 after chemotherapy correlates with prognosis (patients with CA-125 half-life <20 days show improved survival).  Time-to-normalization (rate of fall of CA-125) affects prognosis with more rapid normalization within 3 cycles of chemotherapy correlating with improved survival.<ref name="isbn0-89189-579-5">{{cite book | author = Mais DD, Leonard GR | title = Quick Compendium Companion for Clinical Pathology | publisher = American Society for Clinical Pathology | location = Chicago | year = 2009 | edition = 2nd | pages = 352 | isbn = 0-89189-579-5 }}</ref>

=== Specificity and sensitivity ===

CA-125 has limited [[Specificity_and_sensitivity#Specificity|specificity]] for ovarian cancer because elevated CA-125 levels can be found in individuals without ovarian cancer.

=== Ranges in ovarian cancer ===

While this test is not generally regarded as useful for large scale screening by the medical community, a high value may be an indication that the woman should receive further diagnostic screening or treatment.  Normal values range from 0 to 35 (U/mL).<ref name="pmid18468571"/> Elevated levels in post-menopausal women are usually an indication that further screening is necessary. In pre-menopausal women, the test is less reliable as values are often elevated due to a number of non-cancerous causes, and a value above 35 is not necessarily a cause for concern.<ref name="pmid9665412"/>

In a patient who is clinically selected for testing due to the presence of a adnexal/pelvic mass, CA-125 has great utility to differentiate benign from malignant processes.  In a post-menopausal woman with a palpable adnexal mass and CA-125 level greater than 65 U/mL, the positive predictive value is >95% for ovarian malignancy.  In patients who are not as carefully selected clinically, the utility of this test decreases, thus highlighting the need for careful clinical scrutiny.

==Role in cancer==
[[File:Peritoneal metastasis of Ovarian Cancer.tiff|thumb|Tumor metastasis initiated by interactions between MUC16 and [[mesothelin]].]]
MUC16 has been shown to play a role in advancing [[tumorigenesis]] and tumor proliferation by several different mechanisms. 

===Immune system evasion===

One mechanism by which MUC16 aids in the growth of tumors is by suppressing the response of [[Natural killer cells]], thus protecting cancer cells from the immune response.<ref name="pmid16126266">{{cite journal | author = Patankar MS, Jing Y, Morrison JC, Belisle JA, Lattanzio FA, Deng Y, Wong NK, Morris HR, Dell A, Clark GF | title = Potent suppression of natural killer cell response mediated by the ovarian tumor marker CA125 | journal = Gynecol.

Cell. Sci. | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 1305–18 | year = 2003 | month = April | pmid = 12615972 | doi = }}</ref>

===Metastatic invasion===

MUC16 is also thought to participate in cell to cell interactions that allow for the [[metastasis]] of tumor cells. This is supported by evidence showing that MUC16 binds selectively to [[mesothelin]], a [[glycoprotein]] normally expressed by the [[mesothelial]] cells of the [[peritoneum]].<ref name="pmid14676194">{{cite journal | author = Rump A, Morikawa Y, Tanaka M, Minami S, Umesaki N, Takeuchi M, Miyajima A | title = Binding of ovarian cancer antigen CA125/MUC16 to mesothelin mediates cell adhesion | journal = J.

===Induced motility===

Evidence suggests that the [[cytoplasmic]] tail of MUC16 enables tumor cells to grow and become motile and invasive. This appears to be due to the ability of the [[C-terminal]] domain of MUC16 to decrease the expression of [[E-cadherin]] and increase the expression of [[N-cadherin]] and [[vimentin]], which are expression patterns consistent with [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]].<ref name="pmid21421261">{{cite journal | author = Thériault C, Pinard M, Comamala M, Migneault M, Beaudin J, Matte I, Boivin M, Piché A, Rancourt C | title = MUC16 (CA125) regulates epithelial ovarian cancer cell growth, tumorigenesis and metastasis | journal = Gynecol.

===Chemotherapy resistance===

MUC16 might also play a role in reducing the sensitivity of ovarian cancer tumor cells to drug therapy. Overexpression of MUC16 has been shown to protect cells from the effects of [[genotoxic]] drugs, such as [[cisplatin]].<ref name="pmid19747716">{{cite journal | author = Boivin M, Lane D, Piché A, Rancourt C | title = CA125 (MUC16) tumor antigen selectively modulates the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis | journal = Gynecol.

CA-125 was initially detected using the [[murine]] [[monoclonal antibody]] designated OC125. Drs. Robert Bast, Robert Knapp and their research team first isolated this monoclonal antibody in 1981.<ref name="pmid7028788">{{cite journal | author = Bast RC, Feeney M, Lazarus H, Nadler LM, Colvin RB, Knapp RC | title = Reactivity of a monoclonal antibody with human ovarian carcinoma | journal = J.
