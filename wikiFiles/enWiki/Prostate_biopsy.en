'''Prostate [[biopsy]]''' is a procedure in which small samples are removed from a man's [[prostate gland]] to be tested for the presence of cancer. It is typically performed when the scores from a [[Prostate specific antigen|PSA]] blood test rise to a level that is associated with the possible presence of [[prostate cancer]].

The procedure, usually an outpatient procedure, requires a local anesthetic, with fifty-five percent of men reporting discomfort during the biopsy.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Short-term effects of population-based screening for prostate cancer on health-related quality of life|journal=J Natl Cancer Inst. |date=1998-06-17|first=ML|last=Essink-Bot|coauthors=de Koning HJ et al.|volume=90|issue=12|pages=925–31|pmid=9637143 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pubmed|format=|accessdate=2007-02-14|doi=10.1093/jnci/90.12.925}}</ref> The most frequent complication of the procedure is bleeding in the urine for several days, some bleeding in the stool for several days, and blood in the ejaculate for several weeks afterwards.

The procedure may be performed transrectally, through the urethra or through the perineum.  The most common procedure is transrectal, and may be done with tactile finger guidance,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Finger-guided transrectal biopsy of the prostate: a modified, safer technique|journal=Ann R Coll Surg Engl|year=2005 | month=September|first=M|last=Ghei|coauthors=Pericleous S et al.|volume=87|issue=5|pages=386–7|pmid=16402467|format=|pmc=1963966}}</ref> or, more commonly and precisely, with ultrasound guidance.<ref name=tales>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12842535/ Tales from a prostate biopsy, MSNBC.com]</ref>

About a dozen samples are taken from the prostate gland through a thin needle - about six from each side.  If the procedure is performed transrectally, antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection.  An enema may also be prescribed for the morning of the procedure. In both the transrectal and the transperineal procedure, the doctor inserts an ultrasound probe into the rectum to help guide the biopsy needles.  A local anesthetic is then administered into the tissue around the prostate, similar to the local anesthetic administered for a dental procedure.  A spring-loaded prostate tissue collection needle is then inserted into the prostate, through the rectum (or more rarely through the perineum), about a dozen times.  It makes a clicking sound, and there may be considerable discomfort.<ref name=tales/>

==Negative Biopsy==
Biopsies detect prostate cancer in about 25% of men with abnormal screening tests. However a negative biopsy does not ensure the absence of disease. Repeat prostate biopsies are positive in about 25-30% of patients whose initial biopsy was negative.<ref name="pmid17499308">{{cite journal |author=Graif T, Loeb S, Roehl KA, Gashti SN, Griffin C, Yu X, Catalona WJ  |pmid=17499308 |year=2007 |title=Under diagnosis and over diagnosis of prostate cancer |volume=178 |issue=1 |pages=88–92 |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2007.03.017 |journal=The Journal of Urology}}</ref>

During a biopsy procedure, less than 1 percent of the entire prostate gland is sampled, so men can harbor prostate cancer in spite of having a negative initial biopsy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Recently in order to address this problem, researchers have examined the ability of [[mitochondrial DNA]] to help diagnose prostate cancer in negative biopsy samples.<ref name="pmid20944788">{{cite journal |author= Reguly B, Jakupciak JP, Parr RL. 3.4 kb mitochondrial genome deletion serves as a surrogate predictive biomarker for prostate cancer in histopathologically benign biopsy cores|journal= Can Urol Assoc J. | pmid= 20944788 |year= 2010 |title= 3.4 kb mitochondrial genome deletion serves as a surrogate predictive biomarker for prostate cancer in histopathologically benign biopsy cores |volume= 4 |issue= 5 |pages= E118–22 |pmc= 2950771 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20084081">{{cite journal |author= Robinson K, Creed J, Reguly B, Powell C, Wittock R, Klein D, Maggrah A, Klotz  L, Parr RL, Dakubo GD.

==Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided Biopsy==

For the last two decades, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy has been used to diagnose prostate cancer in a "blind" fashion because prostate cancer cannot be seen on ultrasound due to poor soft tissue resolution. MRI, in contrast, can identify and characterize prostate cancer.<ref name="pmid21571651">{{Cite journal| author = Bonekamp D, Jacobs MA, El-Khouli R, Stoianovici D, Macura KJ. | title = Advancements in MR imaging of the prostate: from diagnosis to interventions. | journal = Radiographics| volume = 31 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 677–703 | year = 2011 | month = May–June| pmid =21571651 | doi=10.1148/rg.313105139 | pmc=3093638}}</ref>  There are two forms of MRI-guided prostate biopsy: one that uses a fusion technology between US and MRI and another using MRI-alone.  In the fusion US/MRI prostate biopsy, a prostate MRI is performed before biopsy and then, at the time of biopsy, the MRI images are fused to the ultrasound images to guide the urologist to the targets.  In the second type of MRI-guided prostate biopsy, MRI is used at the time of biopsy. For US/MRI biopsy, a urologist performs the procedure whereas for MRI-guided prostate biopsy, a radiologist performs the procedure. US/MRI guided prostate biopsy has shown to be superior to standard TRUS-biopsy in prostate cancer detection.<ref name="pmid21555104">{{Cite journal| author = Natarajan S, Marks LS, Margolis DJ, Huang J, Macairan ML, Lieu P, Fenster A. | title = Clinical application of a 3D ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy system. | journal = Urol Oncol| volume = 29| issue = 3 Suppl | pages = :334–42 | year = 2011| month = May| pmid = 21555104 | doi=10.1016/j.urolonc.2011.02.014}}</ref><ref name="pmid21849184">{{Cite journal| author = Pinto PA, Chung PH, Rastinehad AR, Baccala AA Jr, Kruecker J, Benjamin CJ, Xu S, Yan P, Kadoury S, Chua C, Locklin JK, Turkbey B, Shih JH, Gates SP, Buckner C, Bratslavsky G, Linehan WM, Glossop ND, Choyke PL, Wood BJ. | title = Magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion guided prostate biopsy improves cancer detection following transrectal ultrasound biopsy and correlates with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. | journal = Journal of Urology| volume = 186| issue = 4 Suppl | pages = :334–42 | year = 2011| month = October| pmid =21849184 | doi=10.1016/j.juro.2011.05.078}}</ref> The multidisciplinary team approach between radiologists and urologists in prostate cancer diagnosis using MRI is benefiting men with prostate cancer.

==Gleason score==
{{Main|Gleason score}}
The tissue samples are then examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present, and to evaluate the microscopic features (or [[Gleason score]]) of any cancer found.

==Tumor markers==
{{Main|Tumor markers}}
Tissue samples can be stained for the presence of PSA and other tumor markers in order to determine the origin of maligant cells that have metastasized.<ref name="pmid17667550">{{cite journal |author=Chuang AY, Demarzo AM, Veltri RW, Sharma RB, Bieberich CJ, Epstein JI |title=Immunohistochemical Differentiation of High-grade Prostate Carcinoma From Urothelial Carcinoma |journal= The American Journal of Surgical Pathology|volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=1246–1255 |year=2007 |pmid=17667550 |doi=10.1097/PAS.0b013e31802f5d33}}</ref>
