'''Methotrexate''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]]) ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|ɛ|θ|ɵ|ˈ|t|r|ɛ|k|s|eɪ|t}}), abbreviated '''MTX''' and formerly known as '''amethopterin''', is an [[antimetabolite]] and [[antifolate drug]]. It is used in treatment of [[cancer]], [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[ectopic pregnancy]], and  for the induction of medical [[abortion]]s.<ref name=AHFS/> It acts by inhibiting the metabolism of [[folic acid]]. Methotrexate began to replace the more toxic antifolate [[aminopterin]] starting in the 1950s. The drug was developed by [[Yellapragada Subbarao]].

==Medical uses==

===Chemotherapy===
Methotrexate was originally developed and continues to be used for [[chemotherapy]] either alone or in combination with other agents. It is effective for the treatment of a number of [[cancers]] including: breast, head and neck, [[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], lung, [[osteosarcoma]], bladder, and [[trophoblastic neoplasm]]s.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Methotrexate|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/methotrexate.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> 

===Autoimmune disorders===
It is used as a treatment for some [[autoimmune diseases]], including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Juvenile dermatomyositis]], [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[Crohn's disease]], and many forms of [[vasculitis]], to name a few. Although methotrexate was originally designed as a chemotherapy drug (in high doses), in low doses methotrexate is a generally safe and well tolerated drug in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Because of its effectiveness, low-dose methotrexate is now first-line therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Though methotrexate for autoimmune diseases is taken in lower doses than it is for cancer, side effects such as hair loss, nausea, headaches, and skin pigmentation are still common.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mallory|title=Why is chemotherapy used to treat RA, and Why are we told to ignore the side effects?|url=http://maybeitsmallory.blogspot.com/2011/01/why-is-chemotherapy-used-to-treat-ra.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1124/pr.57.2.3}}</ref><ref>American College of Rheumatology Subcommittee on Rheumatoid Arthritis Guidelines (2002) Guidelines for the management of rheumatoid arthritis: 2002 update. Arthritis Rheum 46: 328-346.</ref> Though not everybody is responsive to treatment with methotrexate, multiple studies and reviews showed that the majority of patients receiving methotrexate for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and their doctors. X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many patients receiving methotrexate.<ref>Based on Suarez-Almazor M, Osiri M, Emery P, Ottawa Methods Group. Rheumatoid arthritis. In Evidence-based Rheumatology. London: BMJ Books, 2003.</ref>

It has also been used for [[multiple sclerosis]] but is not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref name=AHFS/>

===Abortion===
Methotrexate is commonly used (generally in combination with [[misoprostol]]) to terminate [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] during the early stages (i.e., as an [[abortifacient]]). It is also used to treat [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic pregnancies]].<ref name=AHFS/><ref name="pmid18522946">{{cite journal |last1=Mol |first1=F. |last2=Mol |first2=B.W. |last3=Ankum |first3=W.M. |last4=Van Der Veen |first4=F. |last5=Hajenius |first5=P.J. |title=Current evidence on surgery, systemic methotrexate and expectant management in the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=309–19 |year=2008 |pmid=18522946 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmn012}}</ref>

===Administration===
It can be taken orally or administered by injection ([[intramuscular]], [[intravenous]], subcutaneous,  or [[intrathecal]]).<ref name=AHFS/> Oral doses are taken weekly not daily.<ref name=AHFS/> Routine monitoring of the [[complete blood count]], [[liver function tests]], and [[creatinine]] are recommended.<ref name=AHFS/> Measurements of creatinine are recommended at least every 2 months.<ref name=AHFS/>

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects include: [[ulcerative stomatitis]], [[leukopenia|low white blood cell count]] and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness, acute pneumonitis and rarely pulmonary fibrosis.<ref name=AHFS/>

Methotrexate is a highly [[teratogenic]] drug and categorized in [[Pregnancy category|pregnancy category X]] by the FDA. Women must not take the drug during pregnancy, if there is a risk of becoming pregnant, or if they are breastfeeding. To engage in any of these activities (after discontinuing the drug), women must wait until the end of a full ovulation cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Central nervous system reactions to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the intrathecal route which include myelopathies and leucoencephalopathies. It has a variety of cutaneous side effects,  particularly when administered in high doses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scheinfeld |first1=N |title=Three cases of toxic skin eruptions associated with methotrexate and a compilation of methotrexate-induced skin eruptions |journal=Dermatology online journal |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=15 |year=2006 |pmid=17459301}}</ref>

Generally, the more "nonspecific" action a pharmacological substance has, the more possible side effects can be expected. Methotrexate has, like all cytotoxic substances, a broad array of possible adverse effects. Care should always be taken to read the manufacturer's original instructions for the preparation in question.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Drug interactions===
[[Penicillins]] may decrease the elimination of methotrexate and thus increase the risk of toxicity.<ref name=AHFS/> While they may be used together increased monitoring is recommended.<ref name=AHFS/>
Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity.
Additionally, methotrexate neurotoxicity—which may cause seizures<!-- in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and maybe other cancers --><ref>Maytal J, Grossman R, Yusuf FH, Shende AC, Karayalycin G, Lanzkowsky P, Schaul N, Eviatar L. 1995. Prognosis and treatment of seizures in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Epilepsia 36(8): 831-6.</ref>—is known to be induced by [[phenobarbital]] and [[carbamazepine]], which are antiepileptic drugs.<ref>Halwachs S, Lakoma C, Schafer I, et al. 2011. The antiepileptic drugs phenobarbital and carbamazepine reduce transport of methotrexate in rat choroid plexus by down-regulation of the reduced folate carrier. Molecular pharmacology 80(4): 621-9.</ref> Its effects can be reversed by [[folinic acid]] (leucovorin) in a process known as "leucovorin rescue."

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:Methotrexate dihydrofolic acid.png|thumb|The similar structure of [[dihydrofolic acid]] (top) and methotrexate (bottom) suggests that methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor]]
[[File:DHFR methotrexate.jpg|thumb|left|Methotrexate (green) complexed into the active site of DHFR (blue)]]
Methotrexate is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways.  For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits [[dihydrofolate reductase]] (DHFR), an [[enzyme]] that participates in the [[tetrahydrofolate]] synthesis.<ref name="Rajagopalan">{{cite journal |first1=P. T. Ravi |last1=Rajagopalan |first2=Zhiquan |last2=Zhang |first3=Lynn |last3=McCourt |first4=Mary |last4=Dwyer |first5=Stephen J. |last5=Benkovic |first6=Gordon G. |last6=Hammes |title=Interaction of dihydrofolate reductase with methotrexate: Ensemble and single-molecule kinetics |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=99 |issue=21 |pages=13481–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12359872 |pmc=129699 |doi=10.1073/pnas.172501499}}</ref> The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about one thousand-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of [[dihydrofolate]] to the active [[tetrahydrofolate]]. Folic acid is needed for the ''de novo'' synthesis of the [[nucleoside]] [[thymidine]], required for [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]]. Also, folate is needed for purine base synthesis, so all purine synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[thymidylate]]s, and [[protein]]s.

Methotrexate acts specifically during DNA and RNA synthesis, and thus it is cytotoxic during the S-phase of the [[cell cycle]]. It therefore has a greater toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells (such as [[malignant]] and [[myeloid]] cells, and gastrointestinal and oral mucosa), which replicate their DNA more frequently, and thus inhibits the growth and proliferation of these noncancerous cells, as well as causing the listed side effects. Facing a scarcity of dTMP, rapidly dividing cancerous cells undergo cell death via [[thymineless death]].

For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of DHFR is not thought to be the main mechanism, but rather the inhibition of [[enzyme]]s involved in [[purine metabolism]], leading to accumulation of [[adenosine]], or the inhibition of [[T cell]] activation and suppression of [[intercellular adhesion molecule]] expression by [[T cell]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Andrew |last2=Gudjonsson |first2=Johann Eli |last3=Sigmundsdottir |first3=Hekla |last4=Runar Ludviksson |first4=Björn |last5=Valdimarsson |first5=Helgi |title=The anti-inflammatory action of methotrexate is not mediated by lymphocyte apoptosis, but by the suppression of activation and adhesion molecules |journal=Clinical Immunology |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=154–63 |year=2005 |pmid=15639649 |doi=10.1016/j.clim.2004.09.001}}</ref> In these cases, patients should supplement their diets with [[folate]].

In its low-dose regimen methotrexate blocks the binding of interleukin 1 beta to the interleukin 1 receptor on target cells.<ref>Brody M et al.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Methotrexate is a weak dicarboxylic acid with [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] 4.8 and 5.5, and thus it is mostly [[Ionization|ionized]] at physiologic pH.  Oral absorption is saturatable and thus dose-dependent, with doses less than 40&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> having 42% bioavailability and doses greater than 40&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> only 18%.  Mean oral bioavailability is 33% (13-76% range), and there is no clear benefit to subdividing an oral dose.  Mean intramuscular bioavailability is 76%.

Methotrexate is metabolized by intestinal bacteria to the inactive metabolite 4-amino-4-deoxy-N-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA), which accounts for less than 5% loss of the oral dose.

Factors that decrease absorption include food, oral nonabsorbable antibiotics (e.g. [[vancomycin]], [[neomycin]], and [[bacitracin]]), and more rapid transit through the [[gastrointestinal tract]] (GI) tract, such as [[diarrhea]], while slower transit time in the GI tract from [[constipation]] will increase absorption. Methotrexate is also administered in the [[placenta accreta]], inhibiting the blood circulation to the target site.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1947, a team of researchers led by [[Sidney Farber]] showed [[aminopterin]], a chemical [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[folic acid]] developed by [[Yellapragada Subbarao]] of Lederle, could induce [[cure#Remission|remission]] in children with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the [[mechanism of action]] behind these effects was still unknown at the time.<ref name=Bertino2000>{{Cite book|author=Bertino JR |chapter=Methotrexate: historical aspects |title=Methotrexate |editors=Cronstein BN, Bertino JR |year=2000 |location=Basel |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-7643-5959-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=VCAFHzHAotsC |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>
Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as ''amethopterin'') was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=Leo M. |last2=Miller |first2=Franklin R. |last3=Rowen |first3=Manuel J. |last4=Bock |first4=George |last5=Rutzky |first5=Julius |title=Treatment of Acute Leukemia with Amethopterin (4-amino, 10-methyl pteroyl glutamic acid) |journal=Acta Haematologica |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=157–67 |year=1950 |pmid=14777272 |doi=10.1159/000203749}}</ref> Animal studies published in 1956 showed the [[therapeutic index]] of methotrexate was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate. 

In 1951, [[Jane C.

The drug was then investigated as a treatment for many other cancers, alone or in combination with other drugs, and was studied for other, noncancer indications in the 1970s. In 1988, it was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>http://arthritis.about.com/od/mtx/p/methotrexate.htm</ref>
