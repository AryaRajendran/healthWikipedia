'''Immunolabeling''' is a biochemical process that enables the detection and localization of an [[antigen]] to a particular site within a cell, tissue, or organ.  Antigens are organic molecules, usually a [[protein]], capable of binding to an [[antibody]].  A tag links a antigen-specific antibody with a means of detection.  This tag provides a way to observe the location of antigens to which the antibodies bind.  If the immunolabeling process is meant to reveal information about a cell or its substructures, the process is called [[immunocytochemistry]]. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Nanci|first=A.|coauthors=Wazen, R., Nishio, C., & Zalzal, S.F.|title=Immunocytochemistry of Matrix Proteins in Calcified Tissues: Functional Biochemistry on Section|journal=European Journal of Histochemistry|year=2008|volume=52|issue=4|pages=201-214|pmid=19109094}}</ref> Immunolabeling of larger structures is called [[immunohistochemistry]]. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Matos|first=L.L.|coauthors=Trufelli, D.C., de Matos, M.G., & da Silva Pinhal, M.A.|title=Immunohistochemistry as an Important Tool in Biomarkers Detection and Clinical Practice|journal=Biomarker Insights|year=2010|volume=5|pages=9-20|pmid=20212918}}</ref>  

[[File: Immunolabeling process image.png |thumb| Basic Elements of Immunolabeling]]

There are two complex steps in the manufacture of antibody for immunolabeling.  The first is the production of antibody that binds  specifically to the antigen of interest and the second is the fusion of a tag to said antibody.  Since it is impractical to fuse a tag to every conceivable antigen-specific antibody, most immunolabeling processes use an indirect method of detection.  This indirect method employs a primary antibody that is antigen-specific and a secondary antibody fused to a tag that specifically binds the primary antibody.  This indirect approach permits mass production of secondary antibody that can be bought off the shelf. <ref name="John Walker">{{cite book|last=Rapley|first=edited by John M. Walker, Ralph|title=Molecular biomethods handbook|year=2008|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, NJ|isbn=978-1-60327-370-1|page=1066|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hVinp-TNOd0C&pg=PA994&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api#v=onepage&q&f=false|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref> 

The indirect method first adds the primary antibody to the test system.  The primary antibody seeks out and binds to the target antigen.  The secondary antibody, which is designed to attach exclusively to the (otherwise invisible) primary antibody, is first tagged with a "visualizing" substance (such as a [[fluorescent]] compound, gold beads, particular [[epitope]], or [[enzyme]] producing a colored compound) that is linked to the secondary antibody by a chemical bond and then added to the test system. The secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody (which has already bound itself to the target antigen), thus allowing the (indirect) identification and visualization of the antigen of interest in its native location in the tissue (e.g., in the [[cell membrane]], [[cytoplasm]], or [[nuclear membrane]]). Under certain conditions the method can be adapted to provide quantitative information. <ref name="John Walker">{{cite book|last=Rapley|first=edited by John M. Walker, Ralph|title=Molecular biomethods handbook|year=2008|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, NJ|isbn=978-1-60327-370-1|page=1066|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hVinp-TNOd0C&pg=PA994&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api#v=onepage&q&f=false|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref> 
 
When the secondary antibody is tagged with a piece of gold (or material of similar density), the heavy, electron-dense metal is sufficiently impenetrable to electromagnetic radiation that light or electron [[microscopy]] can reveal the target entity's location. The resulting image is of great precision, thus increasing localization accuracy. <!--does precision increase accuracy?--> The characteristic [[radiation]] emitted by fluorescent compound tags can be photographed or measured at the appropriate wavelength.

The applications of immunolabeling are numerous. For example, immunolabeling can be used to identify the effects of a drug on a particular organ. First, the primary and secondary antibodies are added to a sample of the organ without the drug, then the sample is run through a light and/or electron microscope to get an initial [[control (science)|control]] image (to see what is the normal distribution of the target antigen). Then, the drug is administered to another sample of the organ, followed by the primary and secondary antibodies. The drugged sample is then run through a light and/or electron microscope, and the resulting image helps identify which antigens are activated/induced after a drug is administered. This technique allows scientists to observe how the activated antigens differ from the antigens prior to the administration of the drug.

Immunolabeling can be used in pharmacology, molecular biology, biochemistry and any other field where the precise location of an antibody-bindable molecule is desirable.

==Indirect vs. direct methods==
There are two methods involved in immunolabeling, ''direct'' and ''indirect'' methods.  Although an indirect method is more commonly used in immunolabeling, a direct method can still be used.  In order to prevent any type of cross-reaction between the primary and secondary [[antibodies]] from the same species, a direct method (one layer antibody) can be used.  However, there are more problems with the direct method over the indirect method.  The direct method is ''not'' commonly used in laboratories since the primary antibodies must be covalently labeled, and it can require an abundant supply of purified antibody. Also, it can result in less sensitivity over the direct method. <ref name=Buchwalow>{{cite journal|last=Buchwalow|first=IB|coauthors=Minin, EA; Boecker, W|title=A multicolor fluorescence immunostaining technique for simultaneous antigen targeting.|journal=Acta histochemica|date=2005|volume=107|issue=2|pages=143-148|pmid=15950054}}</ref>

There are different indirect methods that are used due to their highly sensitive results.  First, ''two-step protocols'' are used often to avoid the cross-reaction between the immunolabeling of multiple primary and secondary antibodies mixtures, where secondary Fab antibodies are frequently used.  Secondly, ''haptenylated primary antibodies'' can be used, where the secondary antibody can recognize the associated [[hapten]].  The hapten is covalently linked to the antibody of interest by succinylimidesters or conjugated IgG Fc-specific Fab sections.  Lastly, ''primary monoclonal antibodies that have different Ig isotypes'' can be detected by specific secondary antibodies that are against the [[isotype (immunology)|isotype]] of interest. <ref name=Buchwalow>{{cite journal|last=Buchwalow|first=IB|coauthors=Minin, EA; Boecker, W|title=A multicolor fluorescence immunostaining technique for simultaneous antigen targeting.|journal=Acta histochemica|date=2005|volume=107|issue=2|pages=143-148|pmid=15950054}}</ref>

==Antibody binding and specificity==
Overall, antibodies must bind to the [[antigens]] with a high specificity and affinity. <ref name="Antigen-Antibody Binding">{{cite journal|last=Kumagai,|first=I|coauthors=Tsumoto,K|title=Antigen-Antibody Binding|journal=eLS|date=4/19/2010|year=2010|month=April|pages=1-7|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001117.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001117.pub2/full}}</ref> The specificity of the binding of an antibody mandates that the antibody binds to the [[protein]] that is associated with the [[immunogen]] [[peptide]].  Scientists commonly use monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, which are composed of synthetic peptides.  During the purification process of these antibodies, an immunizing peptide is attached to the affinity column, which decreases the likelihood that the antibodies will bind to unwanted [[epitope]] of the antigen not found on the initial peptide.  Hence, the specificity of the antibody is established by the specific reaction with the protein or peptide that is used for immunization by specific methods (i.e., [[immunoblotting]] or [[immunoprecipitation]]). <ref>{{cite journal|last=Burry|first=RW|title=Specificity controls for immunocytochemical methods.|journal=The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society|date=2000 Feb|volume=48|issue=2|pages=163-165|pmid=10639482}}</ref> 

Much of the determination of specificity of antibodies lies within the type of synthetic peptides or purified proteins being used.  Unfortunately, if the specificity of an antibody is not sufficient, it will greatly affect the binding of the antibody to the protein or peptide. For instance, in the case of synthetic peptides, the advantage is the [[amino acid]] sequence is easily detected; however, the peptides do no always reiterate the 3-D structural conformation or post-translational modification of the native form of the protein.  Therefore, antibodies that are produced to work against a synthetic peptide may have problems with the native 3-D protein.  These types of antibodies would lead to poor results in immunoprecipitation or [[immunohistochemistry]] experiments, yet the antibodies may be capable of binding to the denatured form of the protein during an immunoblotting run.  On the contrary, if the antibody works well for purified proteins in their native form and not denatured, an immunoblot cannot be used as a standardized test to determine the specificity of the antibody binding, particularly in immunohistochemistry. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Bordeaux|first=Jennifer|coauthors=Welsh, Allison; Agarwal, Seema; Killiam, Elizabeth; Baquero, Maria; Hanna, Jason; Anagnostou, Valsamo; Rimm, David|title=Antibody validation|journal=BioTechniques|date=1 March 2010|volume=48|issue=3|pages=197–209|doi=10.2144/000113382}}</ref>    

In regards to an immunolabaling experiment, there was a study done with HeLa cells that were transfected with human fibrillarin and a green fluorescent [[protein tag|tag]] (GFP), and the intensity of the tag was shown as both a weak and strong signal. The fixed (via formaldehyde) fibrillarin-GFP cells were immunolabeled with antibodies for fibrillarin, and these investigators found the nucleoli that had the weak GFP signal were strongly immunolabeled, whereas the strong GFP signal gave rise to weak immunolabeled stains. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheval|first=EV|coauthors=Polzikov, MA; Olson, MO; Zatsepina, OV|title=A higher concentration of an antigen within the nucleolus may prevent its proper recognition by specific antibodies.|journal=European journal of histochemistry : EJH|date=2005 Apr-Jun|volume=49|issue=2|pages=11-18|pmid=15967739}}</ref>

==Specific immunolabeling techniques==
===Immunolabeling for light microscopy===
:Light [[Microscopy]] is the use of a [[light microscope]], which is an instrument that requires the usage of light to view the enlarged specimen.  In general, a compound light microscope is frequently used, where two lenses, the eyepiece, and the objective work simultaneously to generate the magnification of the specimen. <ref name=Murphy>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Douglas B. Davidson; Michael W.|title=Fundamentals of Light Microscopy and Electronic Imaging (Second Edition)|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-69214-0|pages=1-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=e2PNx8w1MqQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=books+that+define+light+microscopy&ots=9sKlGeoZ-U&sig=X_8L-mfOtUAQZwWKYvzvaxP6fso#v=onepage&q=books%20that%20define%20light%20microscopy&f=false}}</ref> 

:Light Microscopy frequently uses immunolabeling to observe targeted tissues or cells.  For instance, a study was conducted to view the morphology and the production of hormones in pituitary adenoma cell cultures via light microscopy and other electron microscopic methods.  This type of microscopy simply confirmed that the primary adenoma cell cultures keep their physiological characteristics ''in vitro'', which matched the histology inspection.  Moreover, 319 monolayer pituitary adenomas cell cultures were viewed by light microscopy and immunocytochemistry, which these cells were fixed with picric acid-formaldehyde and immunolabeled with a monoclonal mouse antibody against human GH and a polyclonal rabbit antibody against PRL.  In summary, immunolabeled monolayer cell cultures of the pituitary ademona cells that were viewed via light microscopy (along with other electron microscopy techniques, i.e., TEM, SEM, and immunogold) can assist with the proper diagnosis of tumors of the ademona cells. <ref name="pmid16044945">{{cite journal |author=Fazekas I, Hegedüs B, Bácsy E, ''et al.'' |title=Characterization of human pituitary adenomas in cell cultures by light and electron microscopic morphology and immunolabeling |journal=[[Folia Histochemica Et Cytobiologica / Polish Academy of Sciences, Polish Histochemical and Cytochemical Society]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=81–90 |year=2005 |pmid=16044945 |doi= |url=}}</ref> 
                
===Immunolabeling for electron microscopy===
:[[Electron Microscopy]] (EM) is a focused area of science that uses the [[electron microscope]] as tool for viewing tissues.  There were two types of electron microscopes that were invented around the same time; however, their functions differ.  The two microscopes are known as a [[transmission electron microscope]] and a [[scanning electron microscope]]. <ref name=Russell>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=John J. Bozzola; Lonnie D.|title=Electron Microscopy: Principles and Techniques for Biologists (2nd Edition)|year=1999|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-7637-0192-5|pages=5 & 9|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zMkBAPACbEkC&oi=fnd&pg=PR21&dq=define+electron+microscopy&ots=AaP_2njGG4&sig=swUjXods5PRFczr51-MkJmlGYz0#v=onepage&q=define%20electron%20microscopy&f=false|edition=2. ed.}}</ref>   

:Electron Microscopy is a common method that uses the immunolabeling technique to view tagged tissues or cells. The electron microscopy method follows many of the same concepts as immunolabeling for light microscopy, where the particular antibody is able to recognize the location of the antigen of interest and view by electron microscopy.  The advantage to the electron microscopy over light microscopy is the ability to view the targeted areas at their subcellular level.  Generally, a heavy metal that is electron dense is used for EM, which can reflect the incident electrons.  First, immunolabeling must be completed at the light microscope to confirm the antigen is still present in the tissue by wax block sections.  Once this step is complete, immunolabeling can be viewed at the electron microscopy level. <ref name="A. George">{{cite book|last=George|first=Andrew J.T.|title=Diagnostic and Therapeutic Antibodies|year=2000|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=9781592590766|pages=439-452|url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/7522198|coauthors=Urch, Catherine E.}}</ref> 

:Immunolabeling and electron microscopy are often used to view chromosomes.  A study was conducted to view possible improvements of immunolabeling chromosome structures, such as [[topoisomerase]] IIα and [[condensin]] in dissected mitotic chromosomes. In particular, these investigators used UV irradiation of separated nuclei or showed how chromosomes assist by high levels of specific immunolabeling, which were viewed by electron microscopy. <ref name=Maeshima>{{cite journal|last=Maeshima|first=K|coauthors=Eltsov, M; Laemmli, UK|title=Chromosome structure: improved immunolabeling for electron microscopy|journal=Chromosoma|date=2005 Nov|volume=114|issue=5|pages=365-375|pmid=16175370}}</ref>

====Immunolabeling for transmission electron microscopy====
:[[Transmission Electron Microscopy]] (TEM) uses a transmission electron microscope to form a two-dimensional picture on a phosphorescent screen by shooting electrons through a thinly sliced tissue.  The brightness of a certain area of the picture is proportional to the amount of electrons that are projected through the specimen (i.e., tissue). <ref name=Russell>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=John J. Bozzola; Lonnie D.|title=Electron Microscopy: Principles and Techniques for Biologists (2nd Edition)|year=1999|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-7637-0192-5|pages=5 & 9|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zMkBAPACbEkC&oi=fnd&pg=PR21&dq=define+electron+microscopy&ots=AaP_2njGG4&sig=swUjXods5PRFczr51-MkJmlGYz0#v=onepage&q=define%20electron%20microscopy&f=false|edition=2. ed.}}</ref>    

:Transmission Electron Microscopy has been used as a way to view immunolabeled tissues and cells.  For instance, bacteria can be viewed by TEM when immunolabeling is applied.  A study was conducted to view the morphology of CS3 and CS6 [[fimbria (bacteriology)|fimbriae]] in different wild-type and recombinant ''Escherichia coli'' strains.  The morphology was detected by TEM, negative staining, and immunolabeling.  More specifically, immunolabeling of the fimbriae confirmed the existence of different surface antigens. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Lüdi|first=S|coauthors=Frey, J; Favre, D; Stoffel, MH|title=Assessing the Expression of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-specific Surface Antigens in Recombinant Strains by Transmission Electron Microscopy and Immunolabeling.|journal=The Journal of histochemistry and Cytochemistry : Official Journal of the Histochemistry Society|date=2006 Apr|volume=54|issue=4|pages=473-477|pmid=16344328}}</ref>     

:In addition, another study was able to visualize the outer membrane vesicle of the gram-negative bacterium ''Shewanella vesiculosa'' by using a thin layer of the specimen, which was viewed by TEM after high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution (HPF-FS).  Specifically, the DNA inside the vesicle was immunolabeled with gold with a monoclonal IgM antibody against the double-stranded DNA. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pérez-Cruz|first=C|coauthors=Carrión, O; Delgado, L; Martinez, G; López-Iglesias, C; Mercade, E|title=New Type of Outer Membrane Vesicle Produced by the Gram-negative Bacterium Shewanella vesiculosa M7T: Implications for DNA Content.|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=2013 Mar|volume=79|issue=6|pages=1874-1881|pmid=23315742}}</ref>

====Immunolabeling for scanning electron microscopy====
:[[Scanning Electron Microscopy]] (SEM) use a scanning electron microscope, which produce large images that are perceived as three-dimensional when, in fact, they are not.  This type of microscope uses a certain area (2-3 nm) of the electrons that will scan the specimen's surface in order to produce electrons from the specimen.  These secondary electrons are detected by a sensor, and the image of the specimen is generated over a certain time period. <ref name=Russell>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=John J. Bozzola; Lonnie D.|title=Electron Microscopy: Principles and Techniques for Biologists (2nd Edition)|year=1999|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass.

:Scanning Electron Microscopy is a frequently used immunolabeling technique.  SEM is able to detect the surface of cellular components in high resolution.  This immunolabeling technique is done very similar to the immuno-fluorescence method, but a colloidal gold tag is used instead of a fluorophore.  Overall, the concepts are very parallel in that an unconjugated primary antibody is used and sequentially followed by a tagged secondary antibody that works against the primary antibody. <ref name=Goldberg>{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=MW|title=Immunolabeling for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and field emission SEM.|journal=Methods in cell biology|date=2008|volume=88|pages=109-30|doi=10.1016/S0091-679X(08)00407-X|pmid=18617031|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617031}}</ref> There have been some cases where SEM with immunolabeling with a gold particle has been deemed as difficult in regards to the particles and charges resolution under the electron beam; however, this resolution setback has been resolved by the improvement of the SEM instrumentation by backscattered electron (BSE) imaging. <ref name=Rosso>{{cite journal|last=Rosso|first=F|coauthors=Papale, F; Barbarisi, A|title=Environmental scanning electron microscopy gold immunolabeling in cell biology.|journal=Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)|date=2013|volume=931|pages=517-523|pmid=23027021}}</ref> To explain, electron backscattered diffraction patterns can be viewed by SEM, where a clean surface of the sample can interact with the primary electron beam. <ref name=Narayanan>{{cite journal|last=Narayanan|first=B.K.|coauthors=Quintana, M.A., & Mills, M.J.|title=Characterisation of ferritic weld microstructures using various electron microscopy techniques: a review|journal=Science and Technology of Welding and Joining|year=2011|volume=16|issue=1|pages=12-22}}</ref>

===Immunolabeling with gold (Immunogold Labeling)===   
:Immunolabeling with gold particles (also known as [[Immunogold labelling|immunogold staining]]) is used regularly for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to be able to successfully identify the area where the antigens and receptors are in cells and tissues. <ref name=Rosso>{{cite journal|last=Rosso|first=F|coauthors=Papale, F; Barbarisi, A|title=Environmental scanning electron microscopy gold immunolabeling in cell biology.|journal=Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)|date=2013|volume=931|pages=517-523|pmid=23027021}}</ref>  The gold particle labeling technique was first published by Faulk, W. and Taylor, G. when they were able to tag gold particles to anti-salmonella rabbit gamma globulins in one step in order to identify the location of the antigens of the salmonella. <ref name=Rosso>{{cite journal|last=Rosso|first=F|coauthors=Papale, F; Barbarisi, A|title=Environmental scanning electron microscopy gold immunolabeling in cell biology.|journal=Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)|date=2013|volume=931|pages=517-523|pmid=23027021}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Faulk|first=WP|coauthors=Taylor, GM|title=An immunocolloid method for the electron microscope.|journal=Immunochemistry|date=1971 Nov|volume=8|issue=11|pages=1081-1083|pmid=4110101}}</ref>            

:Studies have shown that the size of that the gold particle must be enlarged (>40 nm) to view the cells in low magnification, but too large of gold particles can decrease the efficiency of the binding of the gold probe.  These scientists found the usage of smaller gold particles (1-5 nm) should be enlarged and enhanced with silver.  However, it was learned that osmium tetroxide staining can scratch the silver.  They found the reduction of incubation time and the concentration of osmium tetroxide will greatly decrease the amount of scratching.  The gold particle enhancement was found not to be scratched by the osmium tetroxide staining; therefore, many cell adhesion studies of different substrates can use the immunogold labeling mechanism via the enhancement of the gold particles. <ref name=Owen>{{cite journal|last=Owen|first=GR|coauthors=Meredith, DO; Ap Gwynn, I; Richards, RG|title=Enhancement of immunogold-labelled focal adhesion sites in fibroblasts cultured on metal substrates: problems and solutions.|journal=Cell biology international|date=2001|volume=25|issue=12|pages=1251-1259|pmid=11748918}}</ref>
