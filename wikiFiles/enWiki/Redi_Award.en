'''Redi Award''' is an international science award given to scientists who have made significant contributions in [[toxinology]], the scientific study of [[venoms]], [[poisons]] and [[toxins]]. The award is sponsored by the [[International Society on Toxinology]] (ISI).<ref name=meb>{{cite journal |author= Mebs D|title= History of the International Society on Toxinology - A personal view| journal= Toxicon|year=2012| volume=in press|issue= |pages= |pmid= 23237723|doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.11.021}}</ref>

==Origin==

''Osservazioni intorno alle vipere'' (''Observations about the Viper'') written by an Italian polymath [[Francesco Redi]] in 1664 is regarded as the milestone in the beginning of toxinology research. Redi was the first scientist to elucidate the scientific basis of [[snakebite]] and venom of the [[viper]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Francesco Redi |editor=Knoefel PK  |title= Francesco Redi on Vipers |url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5w8VAAAAIAAJ&pg|accessdate= 2013-04-18 |origyear=   |year= 1988  |publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden, the Netherlands  |page=11-17 |isbn= 9004089489}}</ref> He showed for the first time that the viper venom comes from the [[fang]], not the [[gallbladder]] as it was believed; that it is not poisonous when swallowed, and effective only when it enters the  [[blood circulation|bloodstream]].<ref name=hab>{{cite Journal |author= Habermehl GG|title= Francesco Redi—life and work|url= |year= 1994 |volume=32  |issue=4  |pages=411-417|pmid=8052995 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(94)90292-5}}</ref> He even demonstrated the possibility of slowing down the venom action in the blood by tight [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] before the wound. This work is heralded as the foundation of [[toxinology]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hayes AN, Gilbert SG|title= Historical milestones and discoveries that shaped the toxicology sciences| journal= EXS|year=2009| volume=99 |issue=1 |pages= 1-35|pmid= 19157056}}</ref> In honour of the pioneer, the International Society on Toxinology (ISI) instituted the ''Redi Award'' in 1967 in recognition of scientists for their significant contributions in toxinology research.<ref name=meb/>

==Nature of the Award==

The IST awards scientists or clinicians who have made outstanding contributions to the field of toxinology. The award is given at each World Congress of the Society, which is generally held every three years. It is the highest award bestowed by the Society and the most prestigious in the world for toxinologists. Selection for the Award is made by the Redi Award Committee chaired by the editor of ''[[Toxicon]]'' (the official journal of IST) and accompanied by past and present Executive Officers of the Society and former Redi awardees. The result is only announced at the World Congress. The recipient is then invited to present a lecture of his/her own choosing, officially called the Redi Lecture, to the Congress.<ref name=hab></ref><ref>{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title=IST Redi Awards |url= http://www.toxinology.org/IST_RediAward.htm |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref> The Award consists of a framed citation describing the merits of the awardee and a financial assistance to help cover expenses associated with attendance at the meeting.<ref>{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title= International Society on Toxinology By-Laws Article X|url= http://www.toxinology.org/resources/IST%20Constitution-Revised120713.pdf |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref>
