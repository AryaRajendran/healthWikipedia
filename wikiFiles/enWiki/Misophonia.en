'''Misophonia''', literally “hatred of sound”, is a form of decreased sound tolerance. It is believed<ref>{{cite web|title=Sensory modulation in misophonia|url=http://www.sfn.org/am2012/pdf/abstracts/MON_Poster_AM.pdf#page=1042|work=Program No. 367.07. 2012 Neuroscience Meeting Planner|publisher=New Orleans, LA: Society for Neuroscience|accessdate=27 January 2013|author=M. Edelstein, D. Brang, V. S. Ramachandran|page=1042|format=PDF|year=2012}}</ref> to be a neurological disorder characterized by negative experiences resulting only from specific sounds, whether loud or soft.<ref>{{cite web |title=Decreased Sound Tolerance: Hypersensitivity of Hearing |author=Jonathan Hazell |publisher=Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Centre, London UK |url=http://www.tinnitus.org/home/frame/hyp1.htm |accessdate= February 5, 2012}}</ref> The term was coined by American [[neuroscientist]]s Pawel Jastreboff and Margaret Jastreboff.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tinnitis retraining therapy for patients with tinnitus and decreased sound tolerance |authors=Pawel J.

Unlike [[hyperacusis]], misophonia is specific for certain sounds. Little is known about the anatomical location of the physiological abnormality that causes such symptoms but it is most likely high [[central nervous system]] structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hearing, Second Edition: Anatomy, Physiology, and Disorders of the Auditory System |author=Aage R. Møller |publisher=Academic Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-12-372519-6}}</ref> It has been speculated that the anatomical location may be more central than that involved in hyperacusis.<ref>{{cite book |title=Textbook of Tinnitis, part 1 |author=Aage R.

==Symptoms==
People who have misophonia are most commonly annoyed, or even enraged, by such ordinary sounds as other people clipping their nails, brushing teeth, eating, breathing, sniffing, talking, sneezing, yawning, walking, chewing gum, laughing, snoring, whistling or coughing; certain consonants; or repetitive sounds.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=When a Chomp or a Slurp is a Trigger for Outrage |author=Joyce Cohen |date=September 5, 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/health/06annoy.html?_r=3 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Some are also affected by visual stimuli, such as repetitive foot or body movements, fidgeting or any movement they might observe out of the corner of their eyes. Intense anxiety and avoidant behavior may develop, which can lead to decreased socialization. Some people may feel the compulsion to mimic what they hear or see.<ref name=Hadjipavlou/>

==Prevalence and comorbidity==
The prevalence of misophonia is currently unknown but groups of people identifying with the condition suggest it is more common than previously recognized.<ref name=Hadjipavlou>{{cite journal |title=Selective Sound Intolerance and Emotional Distress: What Every Clinician Should Hear |authors=George Hadjipavlou, MD, MA, Susan Baer, MD, PhD, Amanda Lau and Andrew Howard, MD |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=70 |pages=739–40 |publisher=American Psychosomatic Society |year=2008 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/70/6/739.short |accessdate=February 2012}}</ref> Among patients with [[tinnitus]], which is prevalent in 4-5% of the general population,<ref>{{cite web |title=Components of decreased sound tolerance : hyperacusis, misophonia, phonophobia |author=Jastreboff, P., Jastreboff, M. |date=July 2, 2001 |url=http://www.tinnitus.org/home/frame/DST_NL2_PJMJ.pdf |accessdate = February 5, 2012}}</ref> some surveys report prevalence as high as 60%<ref name=Hadjipavlou/> while prevalence in a 2010 study was measured at 10%.<ref>{{cite journal |title=DPOAE in estimation of the function of the cochlea in tinnitus patients with normal hearing. |authors=Sztuka A, Pospiech L, Gawron W, Dudek K. |journal=Auris Nasus Larynx |year=2010 |volume=37(1) |pages=55–60 |pmid=19560298}}</ref>

A Dutch study published in 2013<ref>{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0054706 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0054706}}</ref> with a sample of 42 patients with misophonia found a low incidence for most psychiatric disorders, the exception being [[Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder]] (52.4%).
