The '''choking game''' (also known as the '''fainting game''' and a wide variety of local slang names), refers to intentionally cutting off oxygen to the brain with the goal of inducing temporary [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] and [[euphoria]].  There are two distinct methods used to achieve oxygen deprivation: [[strangling|strangulation]] and self-induced [[hypocapnia]].

==Reasons for practice==
Limited research has been conducted regarding motivations for practicing the fainting game, although thrill-seeking has been identified as a risk factor,<ref name=DrakeEtAl2010>{{citation |year=2010 |author=Drake, Joseph A., Price, James H., Kolm-Valdivia, Nicole & Wielinski, Margaret |title=Association of Adolescent Choking Game Activity With Selected Risk Behaviors |journal=Academic Pediatrics |volume=10 |number=6 |pages=410–416 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187628591000255X |doi=10.1016/j.acap.2010.09.006 |accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> as has the perception that it is a low-risk activity.<ref name=MacnabEtAl2011>{{citation |year=2009 |author=Macnab, A.J., Deevska, M., Gagnon, F., Cannon, W.G. & Andrew, T |title=Asphyxial games or "the choking game": a potentially fatal risk behaviour |journal=[[Injury Prevention]] |volume=14 |pages=45–49 |url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/15/1/45.abstract |doi=10.1136/ip.2008.018523 |accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> Anecdotal reasons stated include:

* Curiosity in experiencing an [[altered state of consciousness]], the experience of a [[greyout]], or an imagined approximation to a [[near-death experience]].<ref name=Neal2008p311reasons/>
* A belief that it can induce a brief sense of [[euphoria]] (a rushing sensation or [[altered state of consciousness|high]]).<ref name=DrakeEtAl2010/><ref name=Neal2008p311reasons/>
* The prospect of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], albeit brief, at no financial cost.

Reasons for practice are distinct from [[erotic asphyxiation]]. Dr. Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London,<ref name='Time 2010-01-18'>{{cite news | first=William Lee | last=Adams | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=A Dangerous Pastime for Teens: The Choking Game | date=2010-01-18 | publisher=Time | url =http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1953653,00.html | work =Time Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2010-01-21 | language = }}</ref> claims that the fainting game is pursued primarily by children and teens "to get a high without taking drugs."  Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification."  It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal.  Unlike erotic asphyxiation, practice of the fainting game appears to be uncommon in adulthood.<ref name=Neal2008>{{citation |year=2008 |author=Neal, Richard McKenzie |chapter=The choking game |chapter-url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zk9Ikmx6JrsC&pg=PA311&dq=%22choking+game%22&hl=en&ei=SP6oTqKbIMHOmAXVsomhDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&sqi=2&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22choking%20game%22&f=false |title=The Path to Addiction: And Other Troubles We Are Born to Know |pages=310–315 (see p.311) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zk9Ikmx6JrsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22path+to+addiction%22&hl=en&ei=XPqoTpX2K-bXmAXHyPDRDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=978-1-4389-1674-3 |accessdate=27 October 2011 |postscript=&nbsp;Hardover ISBN 978-1-4389-1675-0}}</ref>

==Mechanisms behind the activity==

There are two main mechanisms behind many variations of this practice, both resulting in [[cerebral hypoxia]] (oxygen deprivation to the brain). The two mechanisms tend to be confused with each other or treated as one but are quite dissimilar although both have the potential to cause permanent brain damage or death.  The two mechanisms are ''[[strangulation]]'' and ''[[hypocapnia|self-induced hypocapnia]]''<ref name=Neal2008p313>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ozuXuOSpYscC&pg=PA312&dq=%22only+two+mechanisms%22+hypoxia&hl=en&ei=8Q2pTsW0DObZmAWm_v3UDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22only%20two%20mechanisms%22%20hypoxia&f=false Neal (2008), pp.312-313]</ref> and work as follows:

[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|The vulnerable [[carotid artery]], (large, red tube), and the [[vagus nerve]] running parallel on its left]]

===Strangulation===

A ligature such as a belt or rope around the neck, or hands or arm pressure on the neck compresses the [[internal carotid artery]].  Apart from the direct restriction of blood to the brain there are two other significant responses produced by pressing on the neck:
* Pressing on the carotid arteries also presses on [[baroreceptors]]. These bodies then cause [[vasodilatation]] (dilation (widening) of the blood vessels) in the brain leading to insufficient blood to perfuse the brain with oxygen and maintain consciousness.
* A message is also sent via the [[vagus nerve]] to the main [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] of the [[heart]] to decrease the rate and volume of the heartbeat, typically by a third.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epedominion.com/HealthSafty/breath.htm |title=Breath Play |publisher=Epedominion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> In some cases there is evidence that this may escalate into [[asystole]], a form of [[cardiac arrest]] that is difficult to treat.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/757257-treatment</ref> There is a dissenting view on the full extent how and when a person reaches a stage of permanent injury, but it is agreed{{By whom|date=June 2011}} that pressure on the vagus nerve causes changes to pulse rate and blood pressure and is dangerous in cases of [[carotid sinus hypersensitivity]].

This method is responsible for most, but not all, of the reported fatalities.

The method is especially dangerous when practiced alone. Involuntary movements can lead to head trauma and other injuries. If standing, loss of consciousness can result in substantial head trauma through falling. In the event that consciousness is not immediately regained, medical help cannot be sought by a third party, observer, or friends. If the administration of CPR or basic life support is needed due to respiratory or cardiac arrest, help would not be available or quickly summonable when unconscious or not breathing. Also this act could be mistaken for suicide when practiced alone, but accidentally observed by a stranger, to whom the motivation behind the apparent 'strangulation'  is not known.

===Self-induced hypocapnia===

The second mechanism requires [[hyperventilation]] (forced overbreathing) until symptoms of [[hypocapnia]] such as tingling, light-headedness or dizziness are felt, followed by a breath-hold. This alone is enough to cause a blackout, but it is widely believed that the effect is enhanced if lung air pressure is increased by holding the breath "hard" or "bearing down" (tightening the diaphragm as in a forced exhalation while allowing no air to escape or having an assistant apply a bear-hug).<ref name=NealHyperventilation>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ozuXuOSpYscC&pg=PA313&dq=%22second+mechanism%22+hyperventilation&hl=en&ei=rgipTu7OMsr0mAWEhrzVDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22second%20mechanism%22%20hyperventilation&f=false Neal (2008), p.313] (hyperventilation)</ref> These latter actions may augment the effects of hypoxia by approximating the [[Valsalva maneuver]], causing vagal stimulation.

The hyperventilation leads to an excessive elimination of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) whereas no significant additional amounts of oxygen can be stocked in the body. As only carbon dioxide is responsible for the breathing stimulus, after hyperventilation, breath can be held longer until [[cerebral hypoxia]] occurs. The blood also becomes abnormally alkaline as a result of the excessive elimination of carbon dioxide; this subsequent rise in blood [[pH]] is termed [[alkalosis]].  Alkalosis interferes with normal oxygen utilization by the brain.  The symptoms of alkalosis are: neuromuscular irritability, muscular spasms, tingling and numbness of the extremities and around the mouth, and a dizziness, or giddiness, often interpreted as a sense of [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]].

In the body alkalosis generally induces [[vasodilator|vasodilatation]] (widening of the blood vessels) but in the brain alone it causes [[vasoconstriction]] (narrowing of the blood vessels).  This vasoconstriction appears to be made even worse by a sudden increase in blood pressure caused by squeezing or holding the breath ‘hard’.  The alkalosis induced euphoria can be followed rapidly by hypoxia-induced unconsciousness. The sequence of events leading to unconsciousness from hyperventilation is as follows{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}:

#Decrease in [[partial pressure]] of [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] CO<sub>2</sub>.
#Decrease in partial pressure of [[arterial]] CO<sub>2</sub>.
#Increase in blood pH, (respiratory alkalosis).
#Vasoconstriction of blood vessels supplying brain.
#Pooling of the blood present in the brain at the time.
#Brain rapidly uses up [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) available in the pooled blood.
#O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the brain drops.
#Unconsciousness from hypoxia of cerebral tissue.
Because the brain cannot store reserves of oxygen and, unlike other organs, has an exceedingly low tolerance of oxygen deprivation, it is highly vulnerable if vasoconstriction is not reversed. Normally, if the brain is hypoxic, autonomous systems in the body divert blood to the brain at the expense of other organs; because the brain is vasoconstricted this mechanism is not available. Vasoconstriction is only reversed by the build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood through suspension of breathing.

In some versions the bear-hug is replaced by pressure on the neck in which case blackout is a hybrid of strangulation and self-induced hypocapnia.

===Other mechanisms===
Unconsciousness may be induced by other methods although these are controversial:  Pressure over the [[carotid sinus]] may induce a [[fainting|syncope]] (fainting) without any other action at all but this is difficult to reproduce and is not the basis of the game.  For those susceptible to [[carotid sinus syncope]], of which most people would be unaware until it occurred, this can be an exceedingly dangerous game.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

In both ''strangulation'' and ''self-induced hypocapnia'' blackouts the victim may experience dreaming or hallucinations, though fleetingly, and regains consciousness with short-term memory loss and involuntary movement of their hands or feet.  Full recovery is usually made within seconds but these activities cause many permanent brain injuries or death, particularly when played alone or with a ligature.<ref>Chen, Pauline W.

==Prevalence==

==Injuries and fatalities==
[[Image:Choking game age distribution.gif|right|400px]]
Any activity that deprives the brain of oxygen has the potential to cause moderate to severe brain cell death leading to permanent loss of neurological function ranging from difficulty in concentration or loss of short term memory capacity through severe, lifelong mental disability to death{{Citation needed|reason=date apr 2010|date=April 2010}}.
Statistics on fatalities and neurological damage are controversial, no definitive, empirical study exists although the indications are that the practice is a significant contributor to death and disability, particularly among male [[Minor (law)|juveniles]] in most developed countries.  Many{{Who|date=June 2011}} believe that deaths are significantly underreported because of false attributions to suicide.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8995984 Kids are passing out for a deadly high] by Michael Okwu, ''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com Today, MSNBC.COM]'', February 26, 2008</ref>

One study by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found sufficient evidence to indicate that since 1995 at least 82 youths between the age of 6 and 19 have died in the United States as a result of the game (being roughly 1% of the deaths attributed to suicide by suffocation in the same age group), see chart on the right.  Of these 86.6% were male, the mean age being 13.3. 95.7% of these deaths occurred while the youth was alone; parents of the decedents were unaware of the game in 92.9% of cases. Deaths were recorded in 31 states and were not clustered by location, season or day of week.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|first=(CDC)|title=Unintentional strangulation deaths from the "choking game" among youths aged 6-19 years--United States, 1995-2007.|journal=MMWR.

Incidental, or indirect, injuries may arise from falling or uncontrolled movements and crushing by a ligature or an assistant.  Such injuries may include [[concussion]], bone [[fracture]]s, tongue biting and hemorrhaging of the eye.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/14/AR2008021402089.html?nav=hcmodule "'Choking Game' Turned Deadly for 82 Youths"] by Amanda Gardner, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 14, 2008</ref>

The CDC encourages parents, educators and health-care providers to familiarize themselves with the signs of the game.<ref name=CDCmmwr/>  These include: discussion of the game; bloodshot eyes; marks on the neck; severe headaches; disorientation after spending time alone; ropes, scarves, and belts tied to bedroom furniture or doorknobs or found knotted on the floor; and unexplained presence of things like dog leashes, choke collars and bungee cords.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/Media/pressrel/2008/r080214.htm "CDC Study Warns of Deaths Due to the 'Choking Game'"], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention press release, 14 February 2008</ref>

==Other names==

The practice goes by many other names in different parts of the world or simultaneously in a single location.
