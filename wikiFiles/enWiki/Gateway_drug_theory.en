The '''gateway drug theory''' (also called '''gateway theory''', '''gateway hypothesis''' and '''gateway effect''') is the theory that the use of less [[wikt:deleterious|deleterious]] drugs may lead to a future risk of using more dangerous hard drugs and/or crime.<ref>{{Citation |last=Pudney |first=Stephen |year=2002 |month=December |title=The road to ruin?

==Variations of the theory==
Several different hypotheses have been called "gateway" theories in popular discourse.  These include (but are not limited to):

* The gateway substance causes users to be at increased risk for abuse of other substances.<ref name="TruthOnPot.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.truthonpot.com/article/marijuana-the-gateway-to-harder-drugs- |title=Marijuana: The 'Gateway' to Harder Drugs? |publisher=TruthOnPot.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}</ref>
* The gateway substance primes the brain for addiction to other substances (independent of becoming more likely to try other substances).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* A rigid sequence of progression, starting with licit drugs followed by (increasingly dangerous) illicit ones.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Cannabis==
{{Main|Cannabis (drug)}}

Some scientific studies show that the consumption of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] can possibly predict a significant higher risk for the subsequent use of "harder" illicit drugs, while other studies show that it cannot.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bruce|last=Mirken|url=http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/45535|title=Why Smoking Marijuana Doesn't Make You a Junkie|publisher=[[AlterNet]]|date=2006-12-19|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06339/743649-114.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Researchers say smoking pot not always path to hard drugs drug use | first=Anita | last=Srikameswaran | date=2006-12-05}}</ref> Two recent studies are from [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy|School of Pharmacy]],<ref name="Tarter2006GatewayHypothesis">{{cite journal |last1=Tarter |first1=R.

===Studies in favor of the gateway theory===
====Study of Australian Adolescents (10 years)====
A stratified, random sample of 1,943 adolescents was recruited from secondary schools across [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]] at age 14–15 years. This cohort was interviewed on eight occasions until the age of 24–25 years. At age 24 years, 12% of the sample had used amphetamines in the past year, with 1%–2% using at least weekly. Young adult amphetamine use was predicted strongly by adolescent drug use and was associated robustly with other drug use and dependence in young adulthood. Associations were stronger for more frequent users. Among young adults who had not been using amphetamines at age 20 years, the strongest predictor of use at age 24 years was the use of other drugs, particularly cannabis, at 20 years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Degenhardt |first1=Louisa |last2=Coffey |first2=Carolyn |last3=Carlin |first3=John B. |last4=Moran |first4=Paul |last5=Patton |first5=George C. |title=Who are the new amphetamine users?

==== Twin Study ====
A study by researchers at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] attempted to dissect the contribution of genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental influences on the development of dependence on other drugs in those who had used cannabis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Agrawal |first1=Arpana |last2=Neale |first2=Michael C. |last3=Prescott |first3=Carol A. |last4=Kendler |first4=Kenneth S. |title=A twin study of early cannabis use and subsequent use and abuse/dependence of other illicit drugs |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=1227–37 |year=2004 |pmid=15697049 |doi=10.1017/S0033291704002545}}</ref> The study found that while cannabis was strongly predictive of use of other drugs in the future, the main contributors to this effect were the shared environmental and genetic risk for all substances.  However, there was "persisting evidence for some causal influences" of cannabis in the development of other drug dependencies, indicating that the gateway theory could be operative, although not the main cause of the association.

====Study of rats====
In 2006, the [[Karolinska Institute]] in [[Sweden]] used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve "teenage" (28–49 days old, or 6.6–10.4 in human years) rats a small dose of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]], reportedly equivalent to one cannabis joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to self-administer [[heroin]] by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin (but no such effect was found for amphetamines).{{quote|The current findings support the gateway hypothesis demonstrating that adolescence cannabis exposure has an enduring impact on hedonic processing resulting in enhanced opiate intake, possibly as a consequence of alterations in limbic opioid neuronal populations.<ref>[http://diss.kib.ki.se/2007/978-91-7357-064-0/ Ellgren, Maria: Neurobiological effects of early life cannabis exposure in relation to the gateway hypothesis]</ref>}}
The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of [[opiate]]s on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ellgren |first1=Maria |last2=Spano |first2=Sabrina M |last3=Hurd |first3=Yasmin L |title=Adolescent Cannabis Exposure Alters Opiate Intake and Opioid Limbic Neuronal Populations in Adult Rats |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=607–15 |year=2006 |pmid=16823391 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301127 |laysummary=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9488 |laysource=[[New Scientist]] |laydate=July, 5 2006}}</ref> Paul Armentano, policy analyst for [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (United States)|NORML]], claimed because the rats were given THC at the young age of 28 days, is impossible to extrapolate the results of this study to humans.  Also, the previously cannabis-exposed adult rats, despite being desensitized to heroin, were no more likely to get addicted (as measured by likelihood of self-administration) than the controls.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A416164|title=Reefer Madness|first=Jordan|last=Smith|date=2006-11-03|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=[http://www.austinchronicle.com/ The Austin Chronicle]}}</ref>  In addition, not all animal studies agree with the results found in this study (see below).

===Studies not in favor of the gateway theory===
In 1999, a study by the Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Health at the [[Institute of Medicine]] entitled "Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base," found no evidence of a link between cannabis use and the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs on the basis of its particular physiological effect.<ref name=IOM>{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/marimed/notice.html|title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|year=1999|accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref>

====Mathematical Model====
In December 2002, a study by [[RAND]] regarding if cannabis use results in the subsequent use of [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] was published in the British Journal of Addiction, a peer-reviewed scientific publication. The researchers created a mathematical model simulating adolescent drug use. National rates of cannabis and hard drug use in the model matched survey data collected from representative samples of youths from across the United States; the model produced patterns of drug use and abuse. Andrew Morral, associate director of RAND's Public Safety and Justice unit and lead author of the study stated:<ref name="RAND">{{cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB6010/index1.html|publisher=[[RAND]]|date=2002-12-02|accessdate=2012-07-13|title=RAND Study Casts Doubt on Claims that Marijuana Acts as "Gateway" to the Use of Cocaine and Heroin.}}</ref>
{{quote|We've shown that the marijuana gateway effect is not the best explanation for the link between marijuana use and the use of harder drugs ... An alternative, simpler and more compelling explanation accounts for the pattern of drug use you see in this country, without resort to any gateway effects. While the gateway theory has enjoyed popular acceptance, scientists have always had their doubts. Our study shows that these doubts are justified.}}

One reason the risk factor for using drugs in cannabis users is higher is because few people try hard drugs prior to trying cannabis, not because cannabis users increasingly try hard drugs such as amphetamines. For example, cannabis is typically available at a significantly earlier age than other illicit drugs.  Further research has shown that people with a disposition to resort to cannabis use are more likely to live longer and healthier lives than users of other "social drugs" such as alcohol.<ref>{{cite book |author=Morgan, John Jacob Brooke; Zimmer, Lynn Etta |title=Marijuana myths, marijuana facts: a review of the scientific evidence |publisher=Lindesmith Center |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=32–7 |isbn=978-0-9641568-4-5}}</ref>

====Study on American adolescents (12 years)====
In December 2006, a 12 year gateway drug hypothesis study on 214 boys from ages 10–12 by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] was published in the [[American Journal of Psychiatry]]. The study concluded adolescents who used cannabis prior to using other drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, were no more likely to develop a substance abuse disorder than subjects in the study who did not use cannabis prior to using other drugs.<ref name=pmid17151165>{{cite journal |last1=Tarter |first1=R.

====Study on San Francisco vs. Amsterdam====
In 2004, a study comparing cannabis users in San Francisco to those in Amsterdam was done to test the effects of the differing drug policies in the two cities on drug use patterns.  The Netherlands has a drug policy of decriminalization in which cannabis can be bought by adults over 18 in quasi-legal "coffee shops" and used publicly, while in the United States cannabis is criminalized and must be bought in the [[black market]] (often from the same dealers that sell hard drugs) and used "underground". The results found that, compared with their counterparts in Amsterdam the San Francisco cannabis users were significantly ''more'' likely to use cocaine, crack, amphetamines, ecstasy, and opiates despite similar cannabis use patterns and a more permissive drug policy in the Netherlands.<ref name=pmid15117709>{{cite journal |last1=Reinarman |first1=C. |last2=Cohen |first2=P.

====Rat studies====

A study in 3-4 month old rats actually found ''reduced'' reinforcing potential of cocaine in those rats pretreated with THC compared with those treated with vehicle only.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Panlilio |first1=Leigh V |last2=Solinas |first2=Marcello |last3=Matthews |first3=Stephanie A |last4=Goldberg |first4=Steven R |title=Previous Exposure to THC Alters the Reinforcing Efficacy and Anxiety-Related Effects of Cocaine in Rats |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=646–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16738542 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301109}}</ref>  Another rat study (28–49 days old, or 6.6–10.4 in human years) found that, while rats pretreated with THC consumed higher ''doses'' of heroin relative to controls, both groups took up self-administration of heroin at the same rate, and there was no significant difference between groups on the ''reinforcing'' effects of heroin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Solinas |first1=M |last2=Panlilio |first2=L V |last3=Goldberg |first3=S R |title=Exposure to Δ-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Increases Subsequent Heroin Taking but not Heroin's Reinforcing Efficacy: A Self-Administration Study in Rats |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=29 |pages=646–57 |year=2004 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300431 |issue=7}}</ref>

== Alcohol ==
Both alcohol and tobacco tend to precede cannabis use, and it is rare for those who use hard drugs to not have used alcohol or tobacco first.<ref name="Golub A, Johnson BD 2001 225–32"/> Data from the 2005 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in the United States found that, compared with lifetime nondrinkers, adults who have consumed alcohol were statistically much more likely to currently use illicit drugs and/or abuse prescription drugs in the past year.<ref name="oas.samhsa.gov">[http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/2k4/alcDU/alcDU.htm Illicit Drug Use among Lifetime Nondrinkers and Lifetime Alcohol Users], NSDUH, 2005</ref> Effects were strongest for cocaine (26 times more likely), cannabis (14 times more likely), and psychedelics (13 times more likely).  In addition, lifetime drinkers were also six times more likely to use or be dependent on illicit drugs than lifetime nondrinkers.<ref name="oas.samhsa.gov"/>

As with cannabis, this correlation does not, however, necessarily mean that alcohol is a gateway drug (i.e. a causal relationship).  In addition, whether one tries alcohol or cannabis first before the other does not accurately predict later substance use disorders.<ref name=pmid17151165/>

One study found that, in the United States, raising the drinking age to 21 in the 1980s was correlated with an ''increase'' in cannabis use among high school seniors, the ''opposite'' of what the gateway theory would predict. This suggests that the two substances are substitutes rather than complements.  Interestingly, state decriminalization of cannabis did not predict an increase in cannabis use; rather, it predicted a mild decrease in both alcohol and cannabis use.  Higher alcohol ''prices'', however, appeared to reduce the use of both substances, suggesting at least partial complementarity (though not necessarily a gateway).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dinardo |first1=J |last2=Lemieux |pages=991–1010 |first2=T |title=Alcohol, marijuana, and American youth: the unintended consequences of government regulation |issue=6 |volume=20 |journal=Journal of Health Economics |year=2001 |pmid=11758056 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jdinardo/NBER/w4212.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0167-6296(01)00102-3}}</ref>

== Tobacco ==
According to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]], "People who abuse drugs are also likely to be cigarette smokers. More than two-thirds of drug abusers are regular tobacco smokers, a rate more than triple that of the rest of the population."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20051103184120/http://www.nida.nih.gov/nida_notes/NNVol15N5/Craving.html The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the [[NIH]], a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.] – Nicotine Craving and Heavy Smoking May Contribute to Increased Use of Cocaine and Heroin {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} – Patrick Zickler, NIDA NOTES Staff Writer.

The price and tax of tobacco, particularly cigarettes, has been inversely associated with not just cigarette consumption but also that of alcohol<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dee |first1=T |title=The complementarity of teen smoking and drinking |journal=Journal of Health Economics |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=769–93 |year=1999 |pmid=10847934 |doi=10.1016/S0167-6296(99)00018-1}}</ref><ref name="britannica.com">[http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/24267983/Substitution-of-Marijuana-For-Alcohol-The-Role-of-Perceived-Access-and-Harm Substitution of Marijuana For Alcohol: The Role of Perceived Access and Harm], Encyclopædia Britannica, Journal of Drug Education, 2006  by Robert Greene, David K. Lohrmann, Randi J. Alter</ref> and cannabis.<ref name="britannica.com"/> This suggests complementarity between tobacco and alcohol and between tobacco and cannabis, but not necessarily a gateway effect.

A more recent US-Finnish twin study found that those who started smoking tobacco by the age of 12 were 26 times more likely to start using cannabis or other illcit drugs by age 17, compared to those who never smoked. In fact, early tobacco smoking was one of the most powerful predictors of later use of illicit drugs.<ref>http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=18880 Early smoking linked to cannabis use, March 2011</ref>

== Other drugs sometimes alleged to be gateway drugs ==

Due to the past decade's increase in [[prescription drug abuse]], especially narcotic painkillers such as [[Vicodin]] and [[OxyContin]], such substances have also been recently labeled as gateway drugs.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5984643.html Prescription drugs a gateway for teen drug abuse, Cindy George, Houston Chronicle, September 2008]</ref>  In the US, such substances appear to be more common than cannabis as the first "illicit" drug tried,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and are relatively easy to obtain by adolescents.  Due to the similarity between narcotics, those who become addicted to prescription painkillers sometimes move on to heroin since the latter can actually be a cheaper habit to support.<ref>[http://www.tooeletranscript.com/view/full_story/6914286/article-New-drug-rising--heroin?instance=home_news_left New drug rising: heroin] by Scott Spjut, Toole Transcript Bulletin, Apr 01, 2010</ref>  In addition, a study on mice found that using oxycodone during adolescence may sensitize the brain's [[reward system]], possibly predisposing to later addiction.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/544184/ Painkiller Abuse Can Predispose Adolescents to Lifelong Addiction Rockefeller University, 2008]</ref>

[[Caffeine]] has also been alleged by some to be a gateway drug.<ref>[http://esciencenews.com/sources/scientific.blogging/2008/09/24/is.red.bull.a.gateway.drug.some.john.hopkins.experts.say.caffeine.drinks.need.warning.lab Is Red Bull A Gateway Drug?

However, the hypothesis of caffeine being a gateway drug has not been very well studied, and thus there is little to no evidence either way on this question.

== Reverse gateway ==
In addition, there is a less-studied '''reverse gateway theory''' that earlier regular cannabis use predicts later tobacco initiation and/or nicotine dependence in those who did not use tobacco before.  One Australian study<ref name="www3.interscience.wiley.com">{{cite journal |last1=Patton |first1=George C. |last2=Coffey |first2=Carolyn |last3=Carlin |first3=John B. |last4=Sawyer |first4=Susan M. |last5=Lynskey |first5=Michael |title=Reverse gateways? Frequent cannabis use as a predictor of tobacco initiation and nicotine dependence |journal=Addiction |volume=100 |issue=10 |pages=1518–25 |year=2005 |pmid=16185213 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01220.x}}</ref> appears to have found such a correlation. However, they admittedly could not rule out the fact that cannabis is commonly (in many countries, including Australia and most of Europe) mixed with tobacco in joints to enhance burning and/or stretch supplies.  Additionally, though not mentioned in the study, blunts (tobacco-leaf cigars filled with cannabis) are commonly used by some smokers in the United States as well, despite tobacco-mixed joints being relatively uncommon there. Such "traditions," as opposed to cannabis ''per se'', could plausibly act as a "Trojan horse" for developing a nicotine habit.<ref>[http://www.groups.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/National_Cannabis_Strategy_Consultation_Paper.pdf Australian Government Department of Health: National Cannabis Strategy Consultation Paper], page 4.  "Cannabis has been described as a 'Trojan Horse' for nicotine addiction, given the usual method of mixing cannabis with tobacco when preparing marijuana for administration."</ref>

Cannabis use only predicted later nicotine ''dependence'' in non-dependent tobacco smokers who also used cannabis ''daily'', and even for them cannabis had no significant effect on the likelihood of ''quitting'' tobacco.<ref name="www3.interscience.wiley.com"/>

An American study<ref name="progression">{{cite journal |last1=Timberlake |first1=David S. |last2=Haberstick |first2=Brett C. |last3=Hopfer |first3=Christian J. |last4=Bricker |first4=Josh |last5=Sakai |first5=Joseph T. |last6=Lessem |first6=Jeffrey M. |last7=Hewitt |first7=John K. |title=Progression from marijuana use to daily smoking and nicotine dependence in a national sample of U.S. adolescents |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=88 |issue=2–3 |pages=272–81 |year=2007 |pmid=17174040 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.11.005 |pmc=2596656}}</ref> also found a modest association between earlier cannabis use and later daily smoking (and nicotine dependence) as well, specifically among those who had smoked at least one tobacco cigarette.  However, the results were not always statistically significant, and said nothing about the risk of ''initiating'' tobacco use.  The smoking of blunts was also not addressed.

On the other hand, a more recent Australian twin study casts doubt on the hypothesis of a truly causal relationship between early (or any) cannabis use and later nicotine dependence. Rather, it was found to be largely due to common genetic factors, with no remaining evidence for a reverse gateway effect.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timberlake |first1=David S. |last2=Haberstick |first2=Brett C. |last3=Hopfer |first3=Christian J. |last4=Bricker |first4=Josh |last5=Sakai |first5=Joseph T. |last6=Lessem |first6=Jeffrey M. |last7=Hewitt |first7=John K. |title=Progression from marijuana use to daily smoking and nicotine dependence in a national sample of U.S. adolescents |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=88 |pages=272–81 |year=2007 |pmc=2596656 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.11.005 |pmid=17174040 |issue=2–3}}</ref>

== Criticisms ==
The gateway theory has been the subject of much criticism. Perhaps most common is the claim that gateway theory proponents commit either the ''[[post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' or the ''[[correlation does not imply causation|cum hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' logical [[fallacy|fallacies]]. In the latter case, it is argued, proponents of the gateway theory invalidly infer a [[causality|causal]] relationship between two variables (in this case, the relationship between the use of less harmful [[Hard and soft drugs|soft drugs]] and the use of more dangerous [[Hard and soft drugs|hard drugs]]) from a relationship between the two variables that is strictly [[Correlation and dependence|correlational]].<ref name="RAND"/><ref name=pmid15117709/><ref>[http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/gateway_myth.htm Schaffer Library of Drug Policy]</ref><ref name="ukcia.org">[http://www.ukcia.org/culture/effects/gateway01.php The "Gateway" theory: Does cannabis use lead to hard drugs? Drug use progression and the gateway effect]</ref>

Alternative explanations for the correlation between the use of ''soft drugs'' (e.g., marijuana) and the use of ''hard drugs'' (e.g., cocaine, heroin) include, but are not limited to:

* Some individuals are, for whatever reason, willing to try any substance, and the "gateway" drugs are merely the ones that are (usually) available at an earlier age than the harder drugs.<ref name="RAND"/>
* Particularly for cannabis, which is illegal, exposure to the black market (where harder drugs are available) is suggested to be the real cause.<ref name=pmid15117709/><ref name="ukcia.org"/>
* For teenagers, credibility of adults is eroded when the dangers of the "gateway" drugs are  exaggerated or made up, leading them to think all anti-drug messages are nonsense.<ref name=brecher1972ch20>{{cite book |first=Edward M. |last=Brecher |chapter=Heroin on the youth drug scene - and in Vietnam |chapterurl=http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/CU20.html |title=Licit and illicit drugs; the Consumers Union report on narcotics, stimulants, depressants, inhalants, hallucinogens, and marijuana - including caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1972 |pages= |isbn=0-316-10717-4}}</ref>
* The peer environments in which "gateway" drugs are used can sometimes overlap with the ones in which harder drugs are used, especially in societies that prohibit the substances or impose very high age limits.<ref name=brecher1972ch20/>
* Due to the nature of their merchandise, dealers of the harder illicit drugs may be unwilling to reveal themselves to those unfamiliar with the "gateway" drugs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
