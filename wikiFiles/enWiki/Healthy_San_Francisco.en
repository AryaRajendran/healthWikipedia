==History==
Early in Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]]'s first term, he worked to extend the city-funded health insurance program, started under [[Willie Brown (politician)|Mayor Brown]], to young adults, a program that had been previously offered only to children.  Newsom's more ambitious plan on healthcare began to take shape in 2007.  In his budget proposal for fiscal year 2007-2008, Newsom announced his intention to provide [[universal health care]] for all city residents, based on long-time City Supervisor [[Tom Ammiano]]'s plan. The care would be provided through the San Francisco Health Access Plan also known as Healthy San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-07-07-sf-health-plan_x.htm | title=San Francisco may get universal health care | author=John Ritter | work=[[USA Today]] | date=2006-07-07 | accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1207599,00.html | title=San Francisco's Latest Innovation: Universal Health Care | author=Laura A.

A legal challenge against the program which was filed by the [[Golden Gate Restaurant Association]] in 2006 was denied a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 29, 2010, legally clearing the program for continued existence for the foreseeable future.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-06-29/bay-area/21930039_1_tangerine-brigham-health-care-healthy-san-francisco|title = Healthy San Francisco clears last legal hurdle|author = John Wildermuth|publisher = San Francisco Chronicle|date = June 29, 2010}}></ref>

==Funding==
"Healthy San Francisco receives funding from the city, the federal government, patient [co-payments] and fees imposed on San Francisco businesses that do not provide health coverage for their workers."<ref name="californiahealthline.org"/>  The Health Care Security Ordinance included a requirement that employers with more than 20 workers spend at least a minimum amount towards employee health coverage.  The minimum payment for 2010 ranges from $1.31 to $1.96 per hour, depending on firm size; for-profit employers with fewer than 20 workers and non-profits with fewer than 50 workers are exempt.<ref>http://sfgsa.org/index.aspx?page=418</ref>  Employers can elect to satisfy this requirement by paying into Healthy San Francisco, in which case their workers may apply for the program.<ref name="KFF Key Facts"/>  As of early May 2008 over 700 employers had decided to participate in the program.<ref>Wyatt Buchanan, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/02/BAKC10FB3C.DTL "734 businesses sign up for S.F. health program,"] [[San Francisco Chronicle]], May 2, 2008</ref><ref name="KFF Some Shift Costs">[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=51941 "Coverage & Access | Healthy San Francisco Program Prompts Some Companies To Shift Costs to Consumers but Appears Effective,"] Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report, [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], May 5, 2008</ref>  Early evidence suggest that employers are spending more on [[Health insurance in the United States|health benefits]], but some are raising [[price]]s and cutting back on hiring.<ref name="KFF Some Shift Costs"/><ref>Phred Dvorak, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120994784372766411.html?mod=dist_smartbrief "Firms Adjust to Health-Care Law,"] [[The Wall Street Journal]], May 5, 2008</ref>

The Golden Gate Restaurant Association filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Ordinance, claiming it conflicted with [[ERISA]].  The [[Ninth Circuit]] rejected their arguments in May, 2009, and an appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] was declined.

==Reception==
A 2009 survey of participants found more than 90% were "at least somewhat satisfied" and would recommend it to a friend, but only 40% of participants said their care was considerably better since joining the program, and the survey only included participants who had been allowed to join.<ref>[http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-08-26/bay-area/17176230_1_satisfaction-care-rates "Healthy San Francisco rates high in satisfaction"], by Heather Knight, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', August 26, 2009</ref>

A 2011 report found that [[Obamacare|federal health insurance legislation]], better known as Obamacare, signed in 2010 could reduce enrollment by up to 60%, but some would remain enrolled, including undocumented residents, prisoners, and the indigent.<ref name="californiahealthline.org"/>
