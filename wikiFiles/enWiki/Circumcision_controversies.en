Male [[circumcision]] has often been, and remains, the subject of controversy on a number of grounds&mdash;including religious, ethical, sexual, and health. 

The [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] valued the [[foreskin]] and were opposed to circumcision&mdash;an opposition inherited by the canon and secular legal systems of the [[Western Christianity|Christian West]] that lasted at least through to the [[History of Christianity in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], according to Hodges.<ref name="Hodges2001">{{cite journal |last=Hodges |first=F.M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |month=Fall |title=The ideal prepuce in ancient Greece and Rome: male genital aesthetics and their relation to lipodermos, circumcision, foreskin restoration, and the kynodesme |journal=The Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=375–405 |pmid= 11568485 |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/ |accessdate= |doi=10.1353/bhm.2001.0119 }}</ref>  Traditional [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] have advocated male circumcision as a religious obligation.

The [[ethics of circumcision]] are sometimes controversial.  From the mid-19th century, there has been advocacy in some [[English speaking countries|Anglophone countries]] on medical grounds, such as the prevention of [[masturbation]] and "reflex neurosis".<ref name= "Remondino1891" >{{cite book

Also the mass circumcision during the [[exodus from Egypt]].</ref> The [[Bible]] records "uncircumcised" being used as a derogatory reference for opponents{{bibleref2c|1Sam|17:26}} and Jewish victory in battle that culminated in mass post-mortem circumcision, to provide an account of the number of enemy casualties{{bibleref2c|1Sam|18:27}}. Jews were also required to circumcise all household members, including slaves{{bibleref2c|Gen|17:12-14}}&nbsp;– a practice that would later put them into collision with Roman and Christian law (see below).

[[Hellenistic culture]] found [[circumcision]] to be repulsive.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=514&letter=C&search=circumcision#2 Jewish Encyclopedia: Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature]: "Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved [[nudity]]], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18; , Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer. Peah i. 16b; Yeb. viii. 9a). All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons.";  {{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick, M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = The Bulletin of the History of Medicine| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-07-24| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}}</ref> In 167 BCE [[Judea]] was part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Its ruler, [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]] (175–165), smarting from a defeat in a war against [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], banned traditional Jewish religious practice, and attempted to forcibly convert the Jews to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]]. The Olympian [[Zeus]] was placed on the altar of the Temple, and throughout the country Jews were ordered, with the threat of [[execution]], to sacrifice [[pigs]] to [[Greek gods]] (the normal practice in the [[Ancient Greek religion]]), desecrate the [[Shabbat]], eat unkosher animals (especially [[pork]]), and relinquish their Jewish scriptures. Antiochus's decree also outlawed Jewish circumcision, and parents who violated his order were hanged along with their infants.{{bibleref|1Ma|1:46-67|DR}}<ref name= "Remondino1891"/> according to [[Tacitus]], as quoted by Hodges, Antiochus "endeavoured to abolish Jewish superstition and to [[Hellenization|introduce Greek civilization]]."<ref name="Hodges2001"/> Perhaps the most prominent Jewish response during these times, was rebellion. Antiochus's decree motivated the [[Maccabees#The revolt|Maccabees Revolt]], which ultimately ended in the reestablishment of an independent Jewish kingdom. 

In the [[Roman Empire]], circumcision was regarded as a barbaric and disgusting custom.  The consul [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] was condemned to death by the [[Roman Senate]] in 95 CE for, according to the [[Talmud]], circumcising himself and [[Conversion to Judaism|converting to Judaism]]. The emperor [[Hadrian]] (117-138) forbade circumcision.<ref name="Hodges2001"/> 

As for the anti-circumcision law passed by [[Hadrian]], it is considered by many, to be, together with his decision to build a new temple upon the ruins of the [[Second Temple]], which was dedicated to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], one of the main causes of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132-135). The revolt was brutally crushed. According to [[Cassius Dio]], 580,000 Jews were killed, and 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed.<ref>[http://www.roman-empire.net/highpoint/highpoint.html The 'Five Good Emperors'] (roman-empire.net)</ref><ref>[http://www.zuckermann.org/mosaic.html Mosaic or mosaic?—The Genesis of the Israeli Language] by Zuckermann, Gilad</ref>  Cassius Dio claimed that "Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore, Hadrian, in writing to the Senate, did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors: 'If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the army are in health.'"<ref name=Cassius>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History''</ref> Because of the great loss of life in the war, even though Hadrian was victorious, he refused a [[Roman triumph|triumph]].  Hadrian said regarding the war, "I forbade the Jews to mutilate themselves, and they started a war."

Hadrian's policy after the rebellion reflected an attempt to [[Anti-Judaism|root out Judaism]].  All Jews were forbidden to enter [[Jerusalem]] upon pain of death and the city was renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]] and [[Roman Judea]] was renamed [[Syria Palaestina]].  Around 140, his successor [[Antoninus Pius]] (138-161) exempted Jews who circumcised their sons, though not their servants or slaves, from the decree against circumcision.<ref name="Hodges2001"/>

Jewish response to the decrees also took a more moderate form: circumcisions were secretly performed &nbsp;&ndash; even on dead Jews&nbsp;&ndash;.<ref name= "Remondino1891"/> Other Jews pursued a completely different approach, accepting the decrees, and even making efforts to [[Foreskin restoration|restore their foreskins]] to better assimilate into [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic society]]. The latter approach was common during the reign of Antiochus, and again under Roman rule. The foreskin was restored by one of two methods, that were later revived in the late 20th century. The surgical method, described in detail by the physician Celsus (around 25 BC - 50 AD), involved freeing the skin covering the penis by dissection, and then pulling it forward over the glans. Celsus also described a simpler surgical technique used on men whose [[Aposthia|prepuce is naturally insufficient]] to cover their glans.<ref name="Rubin">{{cite journal | last = Rubin | first = Jody P. | title = Celsus's Decircumcision Operation | journal = Urology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–4 | date = 1980-07 | url = http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/rubin/ | doi = 10.1016/0090-4295(80)90354-4 | pmid = 6994325}}</ref> The second approach was nonsurgical. A device called a ''Pondus Judaeus'' (Jewish burden), a special weight made of bronze, copper, or leather, was affixed to the [[penis]], pulling its skin downward. Overtime, a new foreskin was generated, or a short prepuce was lengthened, by means of [[tissue expansion]]. [[Martial]] mentioned the instrument in ''Epigrammaton Libri 7:35''.<ref name="restore"/>

[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] referred to these practices, saying: "Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised."{{bibleref2c|1Cor|7:18}} But he also explicitly denounced the forcing of circumcision upon non-Jews, rejecting and condemning those who stipulated the ritual to Gentile Christians, labelling such advocates as "false brothers",{{bibleref2c|Gal|2:4}} see also [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity]]. According to the same researchers, in the mid-2nd century Jewish leaders introduced a radical method of circumcision, the ''periah'', that left the glans totally uncovered, making it almost impossible to restore the foreskin.<ref name="restore">{{cite web|title=Uncircumcision: A Historical Review of Preputial Restoration |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/schultheiss/}}</ref>

Under the first Christian emperor, [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the two rescripts of Antoninus on circumcision were re-enacted and again in the 6th century under [[Justinian]]. These restrictions on circumcision made their way into both secular and canon law and "at least through the Middle Ages, preserved and enhanced laws banning Hebrews from circumcising non-Hebrews and banning Christians or slaves of any religious affiliation from undergoing circumcision for any reason."<ref name="Hodges2001"/>

===Circumcision controversy in early Christianity===
{{Main|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity}}

The [[Council of Jerusalem|first Christian Church Council in Jerusalem]], held in approximately 50 AD<ref>[[Acts of the Apostles]], chapter {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|15}}</ref> decreed that [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]] was not a requirement for [[Gentile]] converts.  This became known as the "Apostolic Decree"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers]: Council of Jerusalem (A.D. 50 OR 51): "But to still the clamours of the converts from [[Pharisaism]] who demanded that the Gentile converts "must be circumcised and be commanded to observe the [[613 Mitzvots|Law of Moses]]", the matter was discussed in a public meeting. ... By the decree of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] the cause of Christian liberty was won against the narrow [[Judaizers]], and the way smoothed for the conversion of the nations. The victory was emphasized by St. Paul's refusal to allow Titus to be circumcised even as a pure concession to the extremists ({{bibleverse||Galatians|2:2-5}})."</ref> and is one of the first acts differentiating [[Early Christianity]] from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), [[Baptism]], next to [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]] and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[Conversion to Judaism|proselyte to Judaism]] (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a "seal" (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems," 1898, p. 70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the [[Laying on of hands|imposition of hands]], which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. [[Anointing]] with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition."</ref>  At roughly the same time Rabbinic Judaism made their [[Brit milah|circumcision requirement]] even stricter.<ref>"peri'ah", (Shab. xxx. 6)</ref>

According to the [[Columbia Encyclopedia]],<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/circumcision.aspx Entry on "circumcision"], The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-05.</ref> "the decision that Christians need not practice circumcision is recorded in Acts 15;<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|15}}</ref> there was never, however, a prohibition of circumcision, and it is practiced by [[Coptic Christians]]."

The main focus of Christian proselytizing in the early Christian Church were the [[God-Fearers]], [[gentile]] inhabitants of the Roman Empire who were allowed to attend Jewish synagogues as quasi-Jews without the necessity of undergoing the hated rite of circumcision.  All they had to do was swear that there was "One God".  Converts from this group was the primary kernel from which the early Christian Church grew. (About 10% of the inhabitants of the Roman Empire were [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|full Jews]] and God-Fearers.) <ref>Cross, Colin ''Who Was Jesus?'' 1972</ref>

===Islam===
In the early 7th century, Muhammad welded together many Semitic tribes of the Arabian peninsula into the kernel of a rapidly expanding Muslim movement. The one thing that can be said with some certainty is that male and female circumcision was already well established among these tribes, and probably had been for more than a thousand years, most likely as a fertility rite. Herodotus had noticed the practice among various Semite nations in the 5th century BCE, and [[Josephus]] had specifically mentioned circumcision as a tradition among Arabs in the 1st century CE.<ref name="Barton">{{cite book |author=George Barton |title=A sketch of Semitic origins, social and religious |year=1902 |publisher=Macmillan |oclc=1850150 |pages=98–100 |url=http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924029872938 |isbn=1-4286-1575-X}}</ref> There are some narrations attributed to the prophet Muhammad in which he approves of female circumcision, however many scholars believe that these narrations are weak and lack authenticity.<ref>Female Circumcision and Islam; Sheikh (Dr.) `Abd al-Rahmân b.

The practice of circumcision is sometimes characterized as a part of fitrah as mentioned in the [[hadith]] of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] (Quotations of Prophet Muhammad)<ref>Saheeh Al Bukhari Hadeeth No. 5509 http://www.sahihalbukhari.com/sps/sbk/sahihalbukhari.cfm?scn=dsphadeeth&HadeethID=5509}</ref><ref>Saheeh Al Bukhari Hadeeth No. 5511 http://www.sahihalbukhari.com/sps/sbk/sahihalbukhari.cfm?scn=dsphadeeth&HadeethID=5511}</ref>

===Middle Ages to 19th century===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] in his [[Summa Theologica]] questioned why, if under Jewish doctrine circumcision removed [[original sin]], [[Jesus]] was circumcised&nbsp;&ndash; as Jesus had no original sin. Steve Jones suggests there is a theological tradition that Jesus regained his foreskin at the Ascension. "Had he failed to do so, the Saved would themselves have to be operated upon in Paradise so as not to be more perfect than their Saviour."<ref>{{cite book |author=Steve Jones |title=Y: the descent of men, Chapter 5 |year=2005 |publisher=Mariner Books |isbn=0-618-13930-3 |url=http://www.circumstitions.com/y.html}}</ref>

The Jews were expelled from England by Edward I in 1290, ostensibly over social tensions concerning usury. But the public imagination had been gripped by [[blood libel]],<ref>Recurring stories of forced circumcision of Christian boys, often followed by their ritual murder|</ref> since at least the 12th century: "So pervasive was the belief that Jews circumcised their victims ... that Menasseh ben Israil, the Dutch Rabbi who sought from Cromwell the readmission of the Jews in 1656, had to dwell at considerable length in his ''Vindiciae Judaeorum'' at refuting the claim."<ref>{{cite book |author=James Shapiro |title= Shakespeare and the Jews |url=http://books.google.com/?id=BR4BxGfBqrIC&lpg=PA82&dq=england%20expulsion%20jews%20circumcision&pg=PR5#v=onepage&q=&f=false |isbn=978-0-312-21689-4 |year=1998}}</ref>

In 1521, [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] defeated the [[Aztecs|Aztec empire]] in Mesoamerica, which was followed by a large influx of Spanish clergy, whose writings provide most of information about pre-conquest Aztec life and customs largely assembled from interviews with those who survived the invasion and subsequent epidemics, and their descendents. [[Diego Durán]], a Dominican friar, was convinced that the Aztecs were one of the [[lost tribes of Israel]], with a crucial piece of supporting evidence being that they had practised circumcision.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=193tKPdM-ykC&pg=PR29&lpg=PR29&dq=%22diego+duran%22&source=bl&ots=5sUnkVzJaC&sig=O9N2_izOs4W0Hg39molb6-eyIUY&hl=en&ei=AzFHS6SiIsyHkQXxsdyDAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwADgy#v=onepage&q=%22diego%20duran%22&f=false  ''The History of the Indies of New Spain''], Chapter 1 concerns the Jewish origins of the Aztecs, a very common idea at the time.

The key being "a certain form", since Bancroft makes clear in a footnote that the majority of his sources, including [[Clavigero]], Ternaux-Compans, Carbajal Espinosa, Oviedo y Herrera, and especially [[José de Acosta|Acosta]], believed Durán and others "confounded the custom of drawing blood from the secret organs with circumcision", and "the incision on the prepuce and ear to have been mistaken for circumcision", adding that this [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood-letting rite]]<ref>It is now thought this ubiquitous Mesoamerican ritual dates back to the Olmecs. See [http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/publications/RT08/Bloodletting.pdf Olmec Bloodletting: An Iconographic Study]</ref> was "chiefly performed upon sons of great men" (p279). The case was not helped by the fact no reports of seeing a circumcised adult Aztec existed in the literature. Remondino says it is "a matter of controversy" whether the foreskin had actually been removed (p46).<ref name= "Remondino1891"/> 

In regard to the Mayans, Bancroft says that in 1858 [[Brasseur de Bourbourg]] reported finding "traces"

Countries that do not circumcise have often held antipathy for those that do. Being circumcised was an often seen as a sign of disgrace.<ref name= "Remondino1891" /> According to Darby, it was also seen as a serious loss of erogenous tissue: "During the Renaissance and 18th century the centrality of the foreskin to male sexual function and the pleasure of both partners was recognised by anatomists Berengario da Carpi, Gabriello Fallopio and William Harvey, in popular sex manuals like Aristotle's ''master-piece'', and by physicians like John Hunter, who also appreciated the importance of the foreskin in providing the slack tissue needed to accommodate an erection."<ref name="darbymja">{{cite journal

In 1650, English physician [[John Bulwer]] in his study of body modification, ''Anthropometamorphosis: Man Transform'd, or the Artificial Changeling'', wrote of the loss in sexual pleasure resulting from circumcision: "the part which hangeth over the end of the foreskin, is moved up and down in coition, that in this attrition it might gather more heat, and increase the pleasure of the other sexe; a contentation of which they [the circumcised] are defrauded by this injurious invention. For, the shortnesse of the prepuce is reckoned among the organical defects of the yard, … yet circumcision detracts somewhat from the delight of women, by lessening their titillation."  The English historian [[Edward Gibbon]], author of ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', referred to the practice as "a painful and often dangerous rite", and a "singular mutilation" practiced only by Jews and [[Turkish people|Turks]].

The first formal objection to circumcision within Judaism occurred in 1843 in [[Frankfurt]].  The Society for the Friends of Reform, a group that attacked traditional Jewish practices, said that [[brit milah]] was not a [[mitzvah]]  but an outworn legacy from [[Israel]]'s earlier phases, an obsolete throwback to primitive religion.<ref>Gollaher, p.&nbsp;27.</ref> With the expanding role of medicine came further opposition; certain aspects of Jewish circumcision such as ''periah'' and ''metzitzah'' (drawing the blood from the circumcision wound through sucking or a cloth) were deemed unhygienic.  Later evidence that syphilis and [[tuberculosis]]&nbsp;&ndash; two of the most feared infectious diseases in the 19th century&nbsp;&ndash; were spread by mohels, caused various [[rabbis]] to advocate ''metzitzah'' to be done using a sponge or a tube.<ref>Gollaher, p.&nbsp;29.</ref>  (Today, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the largest group of [[Modern Orthodox]] rabbis, endorses using a glass tube.)<ref>[http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100605 Metzitza Be'Peh - Halachic Clarification Regarding Metzitza Be'Peh, RCA Clarifies Halachic Background to Statement of March 1, 2005 ]</ref>

Ephron reports that Gentiles and also some Jewish reformers in early 19th century Germany had criticized ritual circumcision as "barbaric" and that Jewish doctors responded to these criticisms with defences of the ritual or proposals for modification or reform.

Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] recommended circumcision of boys caught masturbating, writing: "A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering anaesthetic, as the pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment." (page 295) But he was opposed to routine circumcision of infants: "It is doubtful, however, whether as much harm as good does not result from circumcision, since it has been shown by extensive observation among the Jews that very great contraction of the meatus, or external orifice of the urethra, is exceedingly common among them, being undoubtedly the result of the prolonged irritation and subsequent cicatricial contraction resulting from circumcision in infancy."

An early British opponent of circumcision was Herbert Snow, who wrote a short book called ''The barbarity of circumcision as a remedy for congenital abnormality'' in 1890.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=45#dow |title=The barbarity of circumcision, 1890.

This period also saw the formation of anti-circumcision organizations in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Activists began creating websites in the mid-1990s, and this process has continued. One such organization distributed questionnaires to circumcised men. The complaints included prominent [[Circumcision scar|scarring]] (33%), insufficient penile skin for comfortable erection (27%), erectile curvature from uneven skin loss (16%), and pain and bleeding upon erection/manipulation (17%).  Psychological complaints included feelings of mutilation (60%), low self-esteem/inferiority to "intact" men (50%), genital dysmorphia (55%), rage (52%), resentment/depression (59%), violation (46%), or parental betrayal (30%). Many respondents reported that their physical/emotional suffering impeded emotional intimacy with their partner(s), resulting in [[sexual dysfunction]].<ref name="hammond1999"/> Prominent men known to be unhappy about being circumcised include [[A E Houseman]], [[W.H. Auden]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]] and his brother [[John Maynard Keynes]], the famous economist.<ref name="Fearfulsymmetries">{{cite book |title=Fearful Symmetries: Essays and Testimonies Around Excision and Circumcision | editor = Chantal Zabus | last=Robert |first=Darby |authorlink= |coauthors=Laurence Cox |chapter=Objections of a Sentimental Character:The Subjective Dimensions of Foreskin loss |page=150 |year=2009 |publisher=Editions Rodopi B.V. |location= |isbn=978-90-420-2572-1 |url= }}</ref>  In 1996 the British Medical Journal published a letter by 20 men saying that "we have been harmed by circumcision in childhood"; they argued that "it cannot be ethical for a doctor to amputate normal tissue from a normal child".<ref name="Fearfulsymmetries"/> [[Benjamin Spock|Dr. Benjamin Spock]] (died 1998), whose [[The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|Baby and Child Care]] is the biggest selling American single-author book in history, originally supported circumcision but changed his mind near the end of his life.<ref>B. Spock, Circumcision - It's Not Necessary ''Redbook'', April 1989</ref> 

Prominent American advocates for infant circumcision include Dr. Thomas Wiswell, who began publishing research on the relative incidence of urinary tract infections in the mid-1980s;<ref>[http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm Neonatal circumcision revisited] Fetus and Newborn Committee, Canadian Paediatric Society

Fink, M.D. (died 1990), who self-published ''Circumcision: A Parent's Decision for Life'' to promote his ideas.

In Australia, Professor [[Brian Morris (biologist)|Brian Morris]], author of ''In Favour of Circumcision'', asserts that circumcision confers many medical benefits including reduced risk of UTIs, penile cancer, HIV, balanitis, posthitis, phimosis, and prostate cancer and argues that circumcision has sexual benefits.<ref name="morris">{{cite web |title=Circumcision: An Evidence-Based Appraisal |url=http://www.circinfo.net/ |author=Brian Morris}}</ref> Morris also claims that circumcision prevents "physical problems" such as "Bathroom splatter" and "Zipper injury".<ref>http://www.circinfo.net/physical_problems.html</ref> However, Morris's views have been strongly criticised by Professor Basil Donovan who argues that the protection from HIV argued by Morris is not an accurate depiction of the HIV research.<ref>{{cite web |title=Book Review |url=http://historyofcircumcision.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=64&Itemid=0 |author=Basil Donovan}}</ref>  David Forbes, chair of the pediatrics and child health policy and advocacy committee of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians has stated that Morris has not been asked to review the college's circumcision policy and is not a member of the college.<ref>{{cite news |title=No evidence to support routine circumcision |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/letters/no-evidence-to-support-routine-circumcision-20090911-fkna.html |author=David Forbes | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2009-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Doctors circumspect on circumcision |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/doctors-circumspect-on-circumcision-20090910-fjep.html |author=Louise Hall | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2009-09-11}}</ref>

The WHO and UNAIDS recommend male circumcision as a means of reducing the rate of HIV infection,<ref>[http://www.unaids.org/en/PolicyAndPractice/Prevention/MaleCircumcision/default.asp ''"...experts attending the consultation recommended that male circumcision now be recognized as an additional important intervention to reduce the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men"''], UNAIDS website</ref> but this has also proved controversial, with doubts raised about the efficacy of mass circumcision campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite web

Another area of continuing dispute is the effect of circumcision on penile sensitivity.  In April 2007, the [[British Journal of Urology]] published a study (Sorrells ''et al.'', 2007) that stated it "conclusively shows that circumcised males have a significant penile sensory deficit as compared with non-circumcised intact men" and that "the most sensitive regions in the uncircumcised penis are those removed by circumcision."<ref name="pmid17378847">{{cite journal |author=Sorrells ML, Snyder JL, Reiss MD, ''et al.'' |title=Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis |journal=[[BJU International]] |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=864–9 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17378847 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x |url=http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/sorrells_2007.pdf |issn= }}</ref>  But in June 2007, the BJU published a letter in response by Waskett and Morris, which concluded that "despite a poorly representative sample and a methodology prone to exaggerating the sensitivity of the prepuce, NOCIRC's claims remain unproven. When the authors' data are analysed properly, no significant differences exist. Thus the claim that circumcision adversely affects penile sensitivity is poorly supported, and this study provides no evidence for the belief that circumcision adversely affects sexual pleasure."<ref>[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.06970_6.x Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis: Response]</ref> Hugh Young responded to this, stating that Waskett and Morris "critique the finding of Sorrells ''et al.'' that 'circumcision ablates [removes] the most sensitive part of the penis' by excluding that part from consideration...

===Genital integrity===

The term "'''Genital Integrity'''" refers to the condition of having complete and unaltered genital organs. [[Doctors Opposing Circumcision]] asserts that genital integrity produces the highest state of health and well-being.

[[Image:Anti-circ protest Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|A lobby against routine infant circumcision on Chicago's Pride Parade]]

Hammond (1999) asserts that every person has a right to a whole and intact body and that, where minors are concerned, "the unnecessary removal of a functioning body organ in the name of tradition, custom or any other non-disease related cause should never be acceptable to the health profession." He says that such interventions are violations of individual bodily rights and "a breach of fundamental medical ethics principles".<ref name="hammond1999">{{cite journal

Many opponents of circumcision see infant circumcision as unnecessary, harmful and unethical;<ref>Doctorsopposingcircumcision.org: [http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/US-MedicalEthicsReport.pdf Medical ethics and the circumcision of children]</ref> some want the procedures prohibited.<ref name="usmgmbill" />  Boyle ''et al''. (2000) suggest that "As we enter the 21st century, appropriate legal action must be taken to safeguard the physical genital integrity of male children."<ref>Boyle GJ, Svoboda JS, Price CP, Turner JN. [http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/boyle1/ Circumcision of Healthy Boys: Criminal Assault?] J Law Med 2000; 7: 301</ref>

Others also see the genital cutting of children as a human rights issue,<ref>[http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/DOC/statement0.html Doctors Opposing Circumcision Genital Integrity Policy Statement]</ref> opposing the [[genital modification and mutilation]] of children, including [[circumcision]] and [[female genital mutilation]].  Several anti-circumcision organizations also oppose the [[sex reassignment surgery|sexual-reassignment surgery]] of infants with [[ambiguous genitalia]].<ref name="usmgmbill">[http://www.mgmbill.org/usmgmbill.htm U.S. MGM Bill<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.studentsforgenitalintegrity.org/ Students for Genital Integrity: fighting for the rights of all sexes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.icgi.org ICGI - Genital Integrity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="nocirc">[http://www.nocirc.org/ National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Current laws in many countries, and United States Federal Law as well as laws in several U.S. states, prohibit the genital modification and mutilation of female minors, with some exceptions based on medical need. Opponents of male circumcision assert that laws against genital modification and mutilation of minors should apply equally to males and females. Many anti-circumcision groups have joined the International Coalition for Genital Integrity <ref>[http://www.icgi.org/intactivist-organizations/ Member organizations of the International Coalition for Genital Integrity]</ref> and endorsed its declaration,<ref>[http://www.icgi.org/information/declaration/ Declaration of the International Coalition for Genital Integrity]</ref> which was adopted by the First International Symposium on Circumcision, on March 3, 1989, at Anaheim, California. (There have been nine such further symposia held since, with the proceedings of several subsequently published in book form.)<ref>Nocirc.org: [http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/ International Symposia on Circumcision, Sexual Mutilations, and Genital Integrity]</ref> [[Intact America]], founded in 2008, lobbies organizations such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and [[Centers for Disease Control]] to alter policy and change attitudes toward male infant circumcision.

However, linking [[male circumcision]] to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is itself highly controversial. Organizations actually involved in combating FGM have been at considerable pains to distinguish the two, as this [[UNICEF]] document explains: "When the practice first came to be known beyond the societies in which it was traditionally carried out, it was generally referred to as "female circumcision". This term, however, draws a direct parallel with male circumcision and, as a result, creates confusion between these two distinct practices."<ref>[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf Changing a harmful social convention, UNICEF]</ref> 

This stance has been largely echoed by Western medical and political authorities. The [[Australian Medical Association]] states: "The AMA rejects the euphemism "female circumcision", sometimes used to describe the various forms of female genital mutilation, because the use of this phrase trivialises the severe and often irreparable physical and psychological damage occasioned to girls and women by these practices."<ref>[http://www.ama.com.au/node/454 Female Genital Mutilation, Australian Medical Association, 1994.]</ref> In the United States, the organization MGMbill.org sent a proposed bill to the US Congress and 15 state legislatures between 2004 and 2007 to extend the prohibition on [[genital modification and mutilation]] of minors to include [[male]] and [[intersex]] children.<ref name="usmgmbill" />  The proposed bill has not been endorsed by any member of Congress.<ref>MGMBill.org: [http://www.mgmbill.org/usmgmbillstatus.htm US MGM Bill Status]</ref>

===Other contemporary controversies===

While circumcision debates are often dominated by the concerns of Anglophone countries, very different controversies over the procedure regularly erupt in other cultural contexts. In South Asia, Pakistan has long used circumcision status as a definitive marker of Indian covert involvement in its internal affairs. But this assumption was thrown into confusion when it was discovered that large segments of its own Muslim male population, specifically from western tribal areas, were themselves uncircumcised.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Pakistan/Circumcision-no-longer-acid-test-to-identify-Indian-spies/articleshow/4387116.cms Circumcision no longer acid test to identify Indian spies]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C12%5C22%5Cstory_22-12-2009_pg3_2 A case of unchecked terrorists]</ref>

Opposition to circumcision exists among Jews in [[Israel]].  Even though there is often pressure from family to circumcise their sons, a small but growing number of Jews are choosing to forgo the procedure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/jerusalempost11-21-02/ |title=A cut above the rest |accessdate=2008-09-26 |last=Krieger |first= Hilary|date= 21 November 2002 | work= |publisher= Jerusalem Post}}</ref> Islamic anti-circumcision groups, such as Qur'an Alone (the principle that by universal agreement of Islamic scholars puts one out of fold of Islam), have also emerged, arguing among other things that routine circumcision is an insult to Allah since it tries to improve on his perfect creation.<ref>[http://www.quranicpath.com/misconceptions/circumcision.html Circumcision: Does the Qur'an approve it?]</ref>

Northern Europe, which has no tradition of routine circumcision, has been struggling with the challenges of its Jewish and Muslim minorities. Finland is considering legislation to legalise male circumcision.<ref>[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/07/finland_considers_legalising_male_circumcision_311435.html Finland Considers Legalising Male Circumcision]</ref> Sweden in 2001 passed a law requiring traditional circumcisers to be certified and for the infants to be given a medically administered anaesthetic. The World Jewish Congress said that "[t]his is the first legal restriction placed on a Jewish rite in Europe since the Nazi era."<ref>[http://www.hrwf.net/religiousfreedom/news/sweden2001.html#JewsprotestSwedish Jews protest Swedish circumcision restriction]</ref> 

On June 26, 2012, a court in [[Cologne, Germany]] ruled that circumcision was "inflicting bodily harm on boys too young to consent", deciding that the practice contravenes the "interests of the child to decide later in life on his religious beliefs".<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18604664</ref> The decision of the court in the city of Cologne, that a child's right to physical integrity trumps religious and parental rights, applied only within the jurisdiction of that court. The ruling was condemned by Jewish and Muslim groups in Europe.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18807040</ref> A broad majority of German lawmakers passed a resolution asking [[Angela Merkel]]'s government to clarify the ruling so as to allow Jews and Muslims to continue to practice their religion.  On 12 December 2012, following a series of hearings and consultations, the [[Bundestag]] adopted a law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions by a vote of 434-100, with 46 abstentions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beschneidung von Jungen jetzt gesetzlich geregelt |url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2012/42042381_kw50_de_beschneidung/index.html |language=German}}</ref>

In the Xhosa areas of South Africa, the large death toll from traditional circumcision provide a constant source of friction between traditional leaders, who oppose medicalised procedures, and health authorities. In 2009 in Eastern Cape Province alone, 80 boys died and hundreds were hospitalised after attending initiation schools.<ref>[http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=368362 Summer circumcision season deaths reach 23]</ref> The controversy looks set to spread to the Zulu, whose present-day king Goodwill Zwelithini has called for the reintroduction of customary circumcision after it was banned by Zulu king [[Shaka]] in the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/17/circumcision-zulu-south-africa-hiv Thousands face agony or death after Zulu king's circumcision decree]</ref> Similar issues, though on a smaller scale, have arisen with traditional circumcision of Aborigines in remote areas of central Australia.<ref>[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/ceremonial-circumcisions-botched-in-nt-20100111-m2kf.html  Ceremonial circumcisions botched in NT]</ref>
