'''Depression''', for the purposes of this article, refers to the [[mental disorder]] known as [[major depressive disorder]]. This kind of depression is a recognized clinical condition and is becoming a common condition in developed countries, where up to 20% of the population is affected by this disorder at some stage of their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondblue.org.au |title=Beyond Blue |accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> Patients are usually assessed and managed as [[Psychiatry#Outpatient treatment|outpatients]], and only admitted to an [[Psychiatry#Inpatient treatment|inpatient]] mental health unit if they're considered a risk to themselves or others.

== Psychotherapy ==
{{Main|Psychotherapy}}
There are a number of different psychotherapies for depression which are provided to individuals or groups by psychotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, [[clinical social work]]ers, counselors or psychiatric nurses. With more chronic forms of depression the most effective treatment is often considered to be a combination of medication and psychotherapy.<ref name="merckmanuals.com"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Thase |first=ME |title=When are psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy combinations the treatment of choice for major depressive disorder? |journal=Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=333–46 |year=1999 |pmid=10587988 |doi=10.1023/A:1022042316895 |ref=harv}}</ref> Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice in people under 18.<ref name=NICEkids5/>

The most studied form of psychotherapy for depression is ''[[cognitive behavioral therapy]]'' (CBT), thought to work by teaching clients to learn a set of cognitive and behavioral skills, which they can employ on their own. Earlier research suggested that cognitive-behavioral therapy was not as effective as antidepressant medication in the treatment of depression; however, more recent research suggests that it can perform as well as antidepressants in treating patients with moderate to severe depression.<ref>{{cite book |title=What Works for Whom?

For the treatment of adolescent depression, one published study found that CBT without medication performed no better than [[placebo]], and significantly worse than the antidepressant [[fluoxetine]]. However, the same article reported that CBT and fluoxetine outperformed treatment with only fluoxetine.<ref>{{cite journal |author= March J, Silva S, Petrycki S, et al. |title=Fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and their combination for adolescents with depression: Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) randomized controlled trial |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume=292 |issue=7 |pages=807–20 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15315995 |doi=10.1001/jama.292.7.807 |ref= harv}}</ref> Combining fluoxetine with CBT appeared to bring no additional benefit in two different studies<ref>{{cite journal |author= Goodyer I, Dubicka B, Wilkinson P, et al. |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and routine specialist care with and without cognitive behaviour therapy in adolescents with major depression: Randomised controlled trial |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=335 |issue=7611 |pages=142 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17556431 |pmc=1925185 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.39224.494340.55 |ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodyer IM, Dubicka B, Wilkinson P, et al. |title=A randomised controlled trial of cognitive behaviour therapy in adolescents with major depression treated by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] (ACT) a mindfulness form of CBT, which has it's roots in behavior analysis, also demonstrates that it is effective in treating depression, and can be more helpful than traditional CBT especially where Depression is accompanied by Anxiety and where it is resistant to traditional CBT.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ruiz |first=F.

A review of four studies on the effectiveness of [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT), a recently developed class-based program designed to prevent relapse, suggests that MBCT may have an additive effect when provided with the usual care in patients who have had three or more depressive episodes, although the usual care did not include antidepressant treatment or any psychotherapy, and the improvement observed may have reflected non-specific or placebo effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coelho HF, Canter PH, Ernst E |title= Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: Evaluating current evidence and informing future research |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages= 1000–05 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18085916 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.75.6.1000 |ref=harv}}</ref>

''[[Interpersonal psychotherapy]]'' focuses on the social and interpersonal triggers that may cause depression. There is evidence that it is an effective treatment for depression. Here, the therapy takes a structured course with a set number of weekly sessions (often 12) as in the case of CBT, however the focus is on relationships with others. Therapy can be used to help a person develop or improve [[interpersonal skills]] in order to allow him or her to communicate more effectively and reduce stress.<ref>{{cite book |author=Weissman MM, Markowitz JC, Klerman GL |title=Comprehensive Guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |pages= |year=2000 |isbn= 0-465-09566-6}}<!--PAGE NUMBER NEEDED--></ref>

== Medication ==
{{Main|Antidepressant}}
[[File:Isoniazid skeletal.svg|thumb|[[Isoniazid]], the first compound called antidepressant]]
To find the most effective pharmaceutical treatment, the dosages of medications must often be adjusted, different combinations of antidepressants tried, or antidepressants changed. Response rates to the first agent administered may be as low as 50%.<ref>Depression Guideline Panel. Depression in primary care. Vol. 2. Treatment of major depression. Clinical practice guideline. No. 5. Rockville, MD: Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, 1999.</ref> It may take anywhere from three to eight weeks after the start of medication before its therapeutic effects can be fully discovered. Patients are generally advised not to stop taking an antidepressant suddenly and to continue its use for at least four months to prevent the chance of recurrence. 

[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), such as [[sertraline]] (Zoloft, Lustral), [[escitalopram]] (Lexapro, Cipralex), [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[paroxetine]] (Seroxat), and [[citalopram]] (Cipralex), are the primary medications considered, due to their relatively mild side effects and broad effect on the symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as reduced risk in overdose, compared to their older tricyclic alternatives. Those who do not respond to the first SSRI tried can be switched to another; such a switch results in improvement in almost 50% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sutherland JE, Sutherland SJ, Hoehns JD |title=Achieving the best outcome in treatment of depression |journal=Journal of Family Practice |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=201–09 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12620174 |url=http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=1406 |ref=harv}}</ref> Another popular option is to switch to the atypical antidepressant [[bupropion]] (Wellbutrin) or to add bupropion to the existing therapy;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zisook S, Rush AJ, Haight BR, Clines DC, Rockett CB |title=Use of bupropion in combination with serotonin reuptake inhibitors |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=203–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16165100 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.06.027 |ref=harv}}</ref> this strategy is possibly more effective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rush AJ, Trivedi MH, Wisniewski SR, et al. |title=Bupropion-SR, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR after failure of SSRIs for depression |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=12 |pages=1231–42 |year=2006 |pmid=16554525 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052963 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Trivedi MH, Fava M, Wisniewski SR, Thase ME, Quitkin F, Warden D, Ritz L, Nierenberg AA, Lebowitz BD, Biggs MM, Luther JF, Shores-Wilson K, Rush AJ |title=Medication augmentation after the failure of SSRIs for depression |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=12 |pages=1243–52 |year=2006 |pmid=16554526 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052964 |ref=harv}}</ref> It is not uncommon for SSRIs to cause or worsen insomnia; the sedating antidepressant [[mirtazapine]] (Zispin, Remeron) can be used in such cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mayers AG, Baldwin DS |title= Antidepressants and their effect on sleep |journal=Human Psychopharmacology |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=533–59 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16229049 |doi=10.1002/hup.726 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Winokur A, DeMartinis NA, McNally DP, Gary EM, Cormier JL, Gary KA |title=Comparative effects of mirtazapine and fluoxetine on sleep physiology measures in patients with major depression and insomnia |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=1224–29 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14658972 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n1013 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lawrence RW |title= Effect of mirtazapine versus fluoxetine on "sleep quality" |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1149–50 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15323610 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v65n0818i |url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10001013 |ref=harv}}</ref> [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia]] can also help to alleviate the insomnia without additional medication.

Two studies suggest that the combination of psychotherapy and medication is the most effective way to treat depression in adolescents. Both TADS (Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study) and TORDIA (Treatment of Resistant Depression in Adolescents) showed very similar results. TADS resulted in 71% of their teen subjects having "much" or "very much" improvement in mood over the 60.6% with medication alone and the 43.2% with CBT alone.<ref name="EBSCO">Van Voorhees, Benjamin W., et al.

A 2008 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] [[meta-analysis]] concluded that "The available evidence suggests that the hypericum extracts tested in the included trials a) are superior to placebo in patients with major depression; b) are similarly effective as standard antidepressants; c) and have fewer side effects than standard antidepressants.

===SAMe===
[[S-Adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe) is available as a prescription antidepressant in [[Europe]] and an over-the-counter [[dietary supplement]] in the US. Evidence from 16 clinical trials with a small number of subjects, reviewed in 1994 and 1996 suggested it to be more effective than placebo and as effective as standard antidepressant medication for the treatment of major depression.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mischoulon D, Fava M |title=Role of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the treatment of depression: a review of the evidence |journal=Am.

==Medical devices==
A variety of medical devices are in use or under consideration for treatment of depression including devices which offer electroconvulsive therapy, [[vagus nerve stimulation]], [[repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation]], and [[cranial electrotherapy stimulation]]. Use of such devices in the United States requires approval by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) after field trials. In 2010 a FDA advisory panel considered the question of how such field trials should be managed. Factors considered were whether drugs had been effective, how many different drugs had been tried, and what tolerance for suicides should be in field trials.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/Depression/22648 "FDA Panel Looks at Trials of Devices to Treat Depression"] article by Emily P.

===Electroconvulsive therapy===
{{Main|Electroconvulsive therapy}}
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a treatment where [[seizure]]s are electrically induced in anesthetized patients for therapeutic effect. ECT is most often used as a "last resort" (from the perspective of hospital psychiatrists) for severe major depression which has not responded to trials of antidepressant or, less often, psychotherapy or supportive interventions.<ref name=APAguidelines>{{cite journal |author=American Psychiatric Association |authorlink=American Psychiatric Association|year=2000 |month=April |title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=Supp 4 |pages=1–45 |pmid=10767867 |url= http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=2605#s23 |ref=harv}}</ref> It has a quicker effect than antidepressant therapy, and thus may be the treatment of choice in emergencies such as catatonic depression where the patient has ceased oral intake of fluid or nutrients, or where there is severe suicidality.<ref name=APAguidelines/> Some evidence suggests it is the most effective treatment for depression in the short-term<ref>{{cite journal |author=The UK ECT Review Group |year=2003 |title=Efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy in depressive disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=The Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9360 |pages=799–808 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673603127055 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12705-5 |ref=harv |pmid=12642045}}</ref> and one study, without a comparison group or assessment of additional treatments given, suggested that in the minority who remit it may be related to improved self-rated [[quality of life]] in both the short-term (which was correlated with the degree of amnesia) and after six months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCall WV, Prudic J, Olfson M, Sackeim H |year=2006 |month=February |title=Health-related quality of life following ECT in a large community sample |journal= Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=90 |issue=2–3 |pages=69–74 |pmid=16412519 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.002 |ref=harv}}</ref> However, the first systematic documentation of the effectiveness of ECT in community practice in the 65 years of its use found much lower [[remission (medicine)|remission]] rates than in prior research, and most of those relapsed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prudic J, Olfson M, Marcus SC, Fuller RB, Sackeim HA |title=Effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy in community settings |journal=Biol.

===Deep brain stimulation===
The support for the use of [[deep brain stimulation]] in [[treatment-resistant depression]] comes from a handful of case studies, and this treatment is still in a very early investigational stage.<ref name="APS">{{cite journal |author=Marangell LB, Martinez M, Jurdi RA, Zboyan H |title=Neurostimulation therapies in depression: a review of new modalities |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=174–81 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17655558 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01033.x |ref=harv}}</ref> A March 2010 systematic review found that "about half the patients did show dramatic improvement" and that adverse events were "generally trivial" given the younger psychiatric patient population than with movements disorders.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lakhan SE, Callaway H | year = 2010| title = Deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder and treatment-resistant depression: systematic review | url = | journal = BMC Research Notes | volume = 3| page = 60 | pmid = 20202203 | pmc = 2838907 | doi=10.1186/1756-0500-3-60}}</ref>

===Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation===
[[Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (rTMS) use in treatment-resistant depression is supported by multiple controlled studies, and it has been approved for this indication in Europe, Canada, Australia, and the US.<ref name="APS"/> A 2008 meta-analysis based on 32 trials found a robust effect of this method on depression, and it appeared similarly effective for both uncomplicated depression and depression that is resistant to medication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schutter DJ |title=Antidepressant efficacy of high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in double-blind sham-controlled designs: a meta-analysis |journal=Psychol Med |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18447962 |doi=10.1017/S0033291708003462 |ref=harv}}</ref> However, it was inferior to ECT in a side-by-side randomized trial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eranti S, Mogg A, Pluck G, et al. |title=A randomized, controlled trial with 6-month follow-up of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy for severe depression |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=1 |pages=73–81 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17202547 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.1.73 |ref=harv}}</ref>

=== Vagus nerve stimulation ===
[[Vagus nerve stimulation]] (VNS) uses an implanted electrode and generator to deliver electrical pulses to the vagus nerve, one of the primary nerves emanating from the brain. It is an approved therapy for treatment-resistant depression in the EU and US and is sometimes used as an adjunct to existing antidepressant treatment. The support for this method comes mainly from open-label trials, which indicate that several months may be required to see a benefit.<ref name="APS"/> The only large double-blind trial conducted lasted only 10 weeks and yielded inconclusive results; VNS failed to show superiority over a sham treatment on the primary efficacy outcome, but the results were more favorable for one of the secondary outcomes. The authors concluded "This study did not yield definitive evidence of short-term efficacy for adjunctive VNS in treatment-resistant depression."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rush AJ, Marangell LB, Sackeim HA, et al. |title=Vagus nerve stimulation for treatment-resistant depression: A randomized, controlled acute phase trial |journal= Biological Psychiatry |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=347–54 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16139580 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.05.025 |ref=harv}}</ref>

=== Cranial electrotherapy stimulation ===
[[Cranial electrotherapy stimulation]] (CES, electrosleep) devices currently on the market have been granted marketing authorization by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) because a sufficiently similar device had been marketed before 1976, when new regulations requiring controlled testing were introduced.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=882.5800 FDA > CDRH > CFR Title 21 Database Search<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> The FDA considers them to be class III devices—"devices for which insufficient information exists to ... provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness"<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/515iltr.html FDA 515(i) Reclassification Letter to Manufacturers]</ref> The effects of CES on depression were inconclusive or negative in multiple double-blind studies of psychiatric patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Levitt EA, James NM, Flavell P |title=A clinical trial of electrosleep therapy with a psychiatric inpatient sample |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=287–90 |year=1975 |month=December |pmid=769773 |doi=10.3109/00048677509159864 |ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Passini FG, Watson CG, Herder J |title=The effects of cerebral electric therapy (electrosleep) on anxiety, depression, and hostility in psychiatric patients |journal=J.

== Alternative treatments ==

=== Acupuncture ===
A 2004 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Review]] concluded that based on the low quality of the evidence there is "insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is effective in the management of depression."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Acupuncture for depression |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |editor1-first=Caroline A |date=2004-03-17 |editor1-last=Smith |first=CA |last= Smith |coauthors=PPJ Hay |volume=2005 |issue=2 |pages=CD004046 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004046.pub2 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab004046.html|accessdate=2008-05-02 |pmid=15846693 |ref=harv }}</ref>

===Bright light therapy===
{{Main|Seasonal Affective Disorder}}
[[File:Bright light lamp.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bright light therapy is sometimes used to treat depression, especially in its [[seasonal affective disorder|seasonal form]].]]
A meta-analysis of bright [[light therapy]] commissioned by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] found it to be more effective than placebo—usually dim light—for both [[seasonal affective disorder]] and for nonseasonal depression, with effect sizes similar to those for conventional antidepressants. For non-seasonal depression, adding light therapy to the standard antidepressant treatment was not effective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Golden RN, Gaynes BN, Ekstrom RD, et al. |title=The efficacy of light therapy in the treatment of mood disorders: a review and meta-analysis of the evidence |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=656–62 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15800134 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.4.656 |ref=harv}}</ref> A meta-analysis of light therapy for non-seasonal depression conducted by Cochrane Collaboration, studied a different set of trials, where light was used mostly as an addition to medication or [[sleep deprivation]]. A moderate statistically significant effect of light therapy was found; however, it disappeared if a different statistical technique was used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tuunainen A, Kripke DF, Endo T |editor1-last=Tuunainen |editor1-first=Arja |title=Light therapy for non-seasonal depression |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue= 2 |pages=CD004050 |year=2004 |pmid=15106233 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004050.pub2 |ref=harv}}</ref> Both analyses noted poor quality of most studies and their small size, and urged caution in the interpretation of their results. The short 1–2 weeks duration of most trials makes it unclear whether the effect of light therapy could be sustained in the longer term.

===DHEA===
[[Dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), a metabolic precursor for several hormones including estrogen and testosterone, has been promoted as a remedy for many ailments. Sold in the 1970s and 1980s as a weight-loss aid, it was subsequently banned for over-the-counter sale in the US, but then unbanned, and is currently available as a supplement. Very few clinical trials of DHEA in depression have been performed but, in a 2010 review, Nicole Maninger and colleagues reported that "to date, every controlled trial of DHEA in depression has reported significant antidepressant effects. Although these data are encouraging, more large-scale studies will be required to establish the place, if any, of DHEA in the management of patients with depression. For example, there have been no head-to-head trials comparing DHEA to standard antidepressants ... The risks and benefits of long-term DHEA administration also remain to be further clarified."<ref name = Maninger2010>{{cite journal |author=Maninger N, Wolkowitz OM, Reus VI, Epel ES, Mellon SH |title=Neurobiological and neuropsychiatric effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) |journal=Front Neuroendocrinol |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=65–91 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19063914 |pmc=2725024 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.11.002 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2725024/}}</ref>

===Exercise===
Clinical trials involving subjects with major depressive disorder suggest a modest short-term improvement in mood from exercise, but the evidence is not strong.

===''Rhodiola rosea''===
[[Rhodiola rosea]] is a perennial herb that grows in cold regions in the Northern Hemisphere. The root has long been used in traditional medicine in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and Asia.

=== Omega-3 fatty acids ===
[[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s have been studied in clinical trials for major depression primarily as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy.

Depression is sometimes associated with poor sleep (difficulty going to sleep, early waking, and general lassitude during the day). The interaction of the two results in each condition worsening.
