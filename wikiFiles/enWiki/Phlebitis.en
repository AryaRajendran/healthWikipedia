'''Phlebitis''' is an [[inflammation]] of a [[vein]], usually in the [[human leg|leg]]s. 

When phlebitis is associated with the formation of [[blood]] clots ([[thrombosis]]), usually in the deep veins of the legs, the condition is called [[thrombophlebitis]].  These clots can travel to the lungs, causing [[pulmonary embolism]]s that can be fatal.

==Etiology==
'''Vasculitis:
*Bacterial: Pathogenic organisms can gain access and stimulate inflammation.
*Chemical: caused by irritating or [[vesicant]] solutions.
*Mechanical: physical trauma from the skin puncture and movement of the [[cannula]] into the vein during insertion; any subsequent manipulation and movement of the cannula; clotting; or excessively large cannula.
*[[Medication]]s including [[celecoxib]], [[olanzapine]],  [[antidepressant]]s, [[vancomycin]] and others.
*[[genetics|Genetic]] as it is known to run in families.
*[[Alcohol abuse]]
*[[Drug abuse]]: Specifically [[Krokodil (drug)|Krokodil]].

==Signs and symptoms==
* Redness ([[erythema]]) and warmth with a temperature elevation of a degree or more above the baseline
* Pain or burning along the length of the vein
* Swelling ([[edema]])
* Vein being hard and cord-like
* If occurring due to an intravenous infusion line, then decrease the infusion rate

==Complications==
Phlebitis is a [[contraindication]] to massage, because massage manipulations may break loose a clot which could travel to the heart or lungs, creating a [[pulmonary embolism]].

==History==
Phlebitis was first described by John Hunter in 1784.
