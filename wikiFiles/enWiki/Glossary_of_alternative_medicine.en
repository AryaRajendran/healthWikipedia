{{Alternative medical systems}}

==A==
* [[Acupuncture]] is the practice of inserting very thin needles in specific acupuncture points or combinations of points on the body.
* Alternative Medical Systems is the name of a [[NCCAM]]<ref name="NCCAM" /> classification for those forms of alternative medicine that are built upon a complete system of ideas and practice. It can include:
** [[Ayurveda]]
** [[Chiropractic]]
** [[Homeopathy]]
** [[Naturopathic medicine]]
** [[Osteopathy]]
** [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]
* [[Anthroposophical medicine]] is a holistic and [[salutogenic]] approach to healing developed in the early twentieth century by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Ita Wegman]]. Practitioners supplement the uniquely [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] approach with conventional and [[homeopathic]] therapies and remedies. Anthroposophical doctors must have a recognized medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], or equivalent).
* [[Anthroposophic Pharmacy]] is the discipline related to conceiving, developing and producing medicinal products according to the anthroposophic understanding of man, nature, substance and pharmaceutical processing. Anthroposophic medicinal products are used within anthroposophic medicine but not only.
* [[Aromatherapy]] is the use of [[essential oil]]s and other aromatic compounds from plants to affect someone's mood or health.
* [[Attachment therapy]] is a form of therapy aimed at children with alleged 'attachment disorders', usually fostered or adopted children. It is substantially based on outdated notions of suppressed rage due to early adverse experiences. Traditionally it uses a variety of confrontational and physically coercive techniques of which the most common form is holding therapy, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience. Following implication in a number of child death and maltreatment cases in the USA there has been a recent move away from coercion by some leading theorists and practitioners. It is largely unvalidated.<ref name="Chaffin">{{cite journal |author=Chaffin M |title=Report of the APSAC task force on attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems |journal=Child Maltreat |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=76–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16382093 |doi=10.1177/1077559505283699 |author-separator=, |author2=Hanson R |author3=Saunders BE |display-authors=3 |last4=Nichols |first4=T |last5=Barnett |first5=D |last6=Zeanah |first6=C |last7=Berliner |first7=L |last8=Egeland |first8=B |last9=Newman |first9=E}}</ref>

* The [[Biomedical model]] of health is a conceptual model of illness that excludes psychological and social factors and includes only biological factors in an attempt to understand a person's illness. According to this model, health constitutes the freedom from disease, pain, or defect, thus making the normal human condition health. The model's focus on the physical processes, such as the [[pathology]], the [[biochemistry]] and the [[physiology]] of a disease, does not take into account the role of social factors or individual subjectivity. The model also overlooks the fact that the diagnosis (that will affect treatment of the patient) is a result of negotiation between doctor and patient.<ref>Annandale, ''The Sociology of Health and Medicine: A Critical Introduction'', Polity Press, 1998</ref>
* [[Body work (alternative medicine)|Body work]] is any therapeutic, healing, or personal development work that involves some form of touching, energetic work, or the physical manipulation of a practically oriented physical and [[somatics|somatic]] understanding of the body.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}<!-- Pleas add any references to main article -->

''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures''. Boston: The First Church of Christ Scientist.</ref> for several centuries after him, was in fact not a short-term dispensation to induce faith but had an underlying principle (specifically God) and method.  While its practice is regarded within the denomination as incompatible with medical care, it also respects the philanthropy of the medical faculty and is uncondemningly non-compulsory.  Resort to Christian Science may be private or involve the care of a [[Christian Science practitioner]].

==P==
* [[Post-Science Medicine]] is based on the concept of self-creation<ref name=”Self-creation web site of Post-Science Institute.”>[http://www.self-creation.org Self-creation web site of Post-Science Institute.]</ref>. Self-creation has been proposed by Hugh Ching, the founder of post-science, base on his patent “Completely Automated and Self-generating Software System” (Pat. No. 5,485,601) 1996, <ref name=”Completely Automated and Self-generating Software System (Pat. No. 5,485,601) 1996.”>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=www.google.com/patents/US5485601.pdf Hugh Ching, Completely Automated and Self-generating Software System (Pat. No. 5,485,601) 1996.]</ref> which identifies [[DNA]] as a prime example of the completely automated software.   Instead of argument based on the observations of the past, such that of [[David Hume]] against the teleological argument for creation, Hugh Ching supports the argument for self-creation based on the expected future development, started by his patent on the completely automated software.  Basically, he believes that most of the work in [[computer science]], especially, in [[artificial intelligence]] are advancing toward the artificial creation of mankind, itself.  The breakthrough in complete automation started, but unfinished, by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Alan Turing]], followed by research in [[artificial intelligence]], [[synthetic biology]], fractal brain theory of [[Wai H. Tsang]], etc., and the patent on completely automated software provides sufficient evidence that mankind possesses the potential to create itself.  And if mankind can eventually create itself, it only stands to reason that the current generation of mankind is most likely also created by an intelligent being capable of self-creation.  The self-creation process is in a steady state with evolution being just a part of the design.  The concept of evolution from random chance could just be the initial transient state in the beginning long, long time ago.  Thus, the theory of self-creation offers a teleological argument, which has eliminated the need of final causes or a beginning.  The concept of self-creation has an immediate implication in [[medicine]].  The nature of completely automated software, such as DNA, is described in the section Completely Automatic Generative Programming under the topic of [[Automatic programming]].  Medicine deals with life and DNA which are both characterized by a permanent design based on complete automation.  For example, there is no way to reach a conclusive result on any drug test because for a permanent entity, the result can only be obtained at infinity in time, which never arrives.  Therefore, medicine must be based on faith.  For people, who have faith in science, Western Medicine is their choice.  For people, who have faith in natural medicine, Eastern Medicine, supplements or Indian Medicine [[Ayurveda]] might be preferred.  Accordingly, for people, who believe in self-creation, should also believe that medicines must have been created with foods and should generally consider natural treatment, such as exercise and helping the body to heal itself, and medicine from natural before resort to other medical treatments.  Post-Science Medicine<ref name=”Post-Science Medicine web site of Post-Science Institute.”>[http://www.postsciencemedicine.com Post-Science Medicine web site of Post-Science Institute.]</ref> is recommended by Post-Science Institute.  All Post-Science Medicine advices are based on the extensive experience of post-science members and extensive surveys of others.  Post-Science Medicine advises that one should not give a suggestion unless one has tested out the suggestion personally or have read the survey.

==Q==
* [[Qigong]] is an exercise aspect of Chinese medicine. Qigong is mostly taught for health maintenance purposes, but there are also some who teach it, especially in China, for therapeutic interventions. There are hundreds of different schools, and it is also an adjunct training of many [[East Asian]] martial arts.

==R==
* [[Reiki]] is a form of treatment developed by Mikao Usui in Japan around 1922. Practitioners use their hands on or above the patient in order to control, increase or open up a postulated energy, "ki", in the body.

* [[Reflexology]]

== S ==
* [[Siddha_medicine|Siddha Medicine]]
* [[Systems medicine]], or [[systems health]], looks at the dynamic systems of the human body as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environment interactions that sustain life. Systems medicine draws on theories from [[holistic medicine]], [[systems science]] and [[systems biology]] when developing a comprehensive approach that considers an individual’s health in light of their [[genomics]], behavior and the external environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1= Ayyadurai |first1= VA Shiva| last2= Chopra|first2= Deepak| url= http://systemshealth.com |title=Systems Health: The Future of Medicine}}</ref><ref name=Chopra>{{cite web|url=http://www.chopra.com/systemshealth-shiva|title=Systems Health - Dr. VA Shiva Ayyadurai| accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1= Federoff |first1= Howard| last2= Gostin|first2= Lawrence O.| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184479 |title=Evolving from Reductionism to Holism: Is There a Future for Systems Medicine?| journal= Journal of the American Medical Association|volume= 302|issue=9 |year=2009| pages=994-996}}</ref>
