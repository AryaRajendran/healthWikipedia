During his two decades at the Salpêtrière, Albert Londe developed into arguably the most outstanding scientific photographer of his time.

In 1878 [[neurologist]] [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] hired Londe as a medical photographer at the Salpêtrière.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beauty of Another Order, Photography in Science|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|author=Kemp,Martin|authorlink=A Perfect and Faithful Record, Mind and Body in Medical Photography before 1900|editor=Thomas, Ann|page=134}}</ref> In 1882 Londe devised a system to photograph the physical and muscular movements of patients (including individuals experiencing [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]]). This he accomplished by using a camera with nine lenses that were triggered by [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] energy, and with the use of a [[metronome]] he was able to sequentially time the release of the shutters, therefore taking photos onto glass plates in quick succession. A few years later Londe developed a camera with twelve lenses for photographing movement.

Londe's camera was also used for medical studies of muscle movement in subjects performing actions as diverse as those of a tightrope-walking and blacksmithing. The sequence of twelve pictures could be created for durations from 1/10 of a second to several seconds. 

Although the apparatus was used primarily for medical research, Londe noted that it was portable, and he used it for other subjects - for example, horses and other animals and ocean waves. General Sobert developed, in conjunction with Londe, a chronophotographic device used to study [[ballistics]]. Londe's pictures were used as illustrations in several books, most notably those by [[Paul Richer]], that were widely read by the medical and artistic fraternity. 

With [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] (1830–1904), Londe performed many photographic experiments of movement, and the layout of his laboratory at the Salpêtrière was similar to Marey's renowned ''Station Physiologique''. In 1893 Londe published the first book on medical photography, titled ''La photographie médicale: Application aux sciences médicales et physiologiques''. In 1898 he published ''Traité pratique de radiographie et de radioscope: technique et applications médicales''. 

Londe also published six journals. Albert Londe's 12-lens camera of 1891 was illustrated in the journal 'La Nature', 1893.
