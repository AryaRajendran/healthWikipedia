'''Gorham's disease''' (pronounced GOR-amz), also known as '''Gorham vanishing bone disease''' and '''phantom bone disease''',<ref name=db>{{cite web|title=Gorham vanishing bone disease information|url=http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/ddb31515.htm|work=Disease Database|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> is a very rare [[bone disease|skeletal condition]] of uncertain [[etiology]], characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of distended, thin-walled [[Vascular system|vascular]] or [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic channels]] within bone, which leads to resorption and replacement of bone with [[angiomas]] and/or [[fibrosis]].<ref name="gorham">Gorham LW, Stout AP.

==Signs and Symptoms==
The symptoms of Gorham's disease vary depending on the bones involved. It may affect any part of the skeleton, but the most common sites of disease are the shoulder, skull, [[pelvic girdle]], jaw, ribs, and spine.<ref name="moller">MÖLLER, G., Priemel, M., Amling, M.

In some cases there are no symptoms until a fracture occurs either spontaneously or following minor [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], such as a fall. There may be an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] onset of localized pain and swelling. More commonly there is pain of no apparent cause that increases in frequency and intensity over time and may eventually be accompanied by weakness and noticeable deformity of the area. The rate of progression is unpredictable and the [[prognosis]] can be difficult. The disease may stabilize after a number of years, go into spontaneous remission, or, in cases involving the chest and upper spine, prove fatal. Recurrence of the disease following [[Remission (medicine)|remission]] can also occur. Involvement of the spine and skull base may cause a poor outcome from neurological complications. In many cases, the end result of Gorham's disease is severe deformity and functional disability.<ref name="moller"/><ref name="yalniz"/><ref name="chattopadhyay">Chattopadhyay P, Bandyopadhyay A, Das S, Kundu A J. Gorham's disease with spontaneous recovery. Singapore Med J 2009; 50(7).</ref>

Symptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain may be present if the disease is present in the ribs, [[scapula]], or [[thoracic vertebrae]]. These may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity. The breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma, because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to lung function testing that are seen in asthma.<ref name="duffy"/> Extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous [[Pleural effusion|pleural]] and [[pericardial effusions]]. [[Chyle]] is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection. The loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences, including infection, malnutrition, and respiratory distress and failure. These complications or their symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, poor growth or weight loss, and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition.<ref name="duffy"/><ref name="lee"/><ref name="chattopadhyay"/>

==Causes==
To date, the specific etiology of Gorham's disease remains undefined.

Bone mass and strength are obtained and maintained through a remarkable process of bone destruction and replacement that occurs at the cellular level throughout a person's life. Cells called [[osteoclasts]] secrete enzymes that dissolve old bone, allowing another type of cells called [[osteoblasts]] to form new bone. Except in growing bone, the rate of breakdown equals the rate of building, thereby maintaining bone mass. In Gorham's disease that process is disrupted.<ref name="gorham"/><ref name="ross"/><ref name="moller"/><ref name="gorham2">Gorham, L.W., Wright, A.W., Shultz, H. H., and Maxon, F. C. "Disappearing bones: A rare form of massive osteolysis: Report of two cases, one with autopsy findings." American Journal of Medicine 17.5 (1954): 674-682.</ref><ref name="heffez">Heffez L, Doku HC, Carter BL, et al: Perspectives on massive osteolysis. Report of a case and review of the literature. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol 55:331-343, 1983.</ref><ref name="johnson">Johnson, Philip M. and McClure, James G. Observations on Massive Osteolysis: A Review of the Literature and Report of a Case. Radiology July 1958 71:28-42.</ref>

Gorham and Stout found that vascular anomalies always occupied space that normally would be filled with new bone and speculated that the presence of [[angiomatosis]] may lead to chemical changes in the bone.<ref name="gorham"/><ref name="gorham2"/> Gorham and others speculated that such a change in the bone chemistry might cause an imbalance in the rate of osteoclast activity to osteoblast activity such that more bone is dissolved than is replaced.<ref name="gorham2"/> Beginning in the 1990s there were reports of elevated levels of a protein called [[Interleukin 6|interleukin-6]] (IL-6) being detected in patients with the disease, leading some to suggest that increased levels of IL-6 and [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) may contribute to the chemical changes Gorham and others believed were the cause of this type of [[osteolysis]].<ref name="moller"/><ref name="dupond">Dupond JL, Bermont L, Runge M, de Billy M. Plasma VEGF determination in disseminated lymphangiomatosis-Gorham-Stout syndrome: a marker of activity? A case report with a 5-year follow-up. Bone. 2010 Mar;46(3):873-6.</ref>

In 1999 Möller and colleagues<ref name="moller"/> concluded, "The Gorham-Stout syndrome may be, essentially, a monocentric bone disease with a focally increased bone resorption due to an increased number of [[paracrine]] – or [[autocrine]] – stimulated hyperactive osteoclasts. The resorbed bone is replaced by a markedly [[Vascularization|vascularized]]  fibrous tissue. The apparent contradiction concerning the presence or absence or the number of osteoclasts, may be explained by the different phases of the syndrome." They further stated that their [[histopathological]] study provided good evidence that osteolytic changes seen in Gorham's disease are the result of hyperactive osteoclastic bone. However, others have concluded that [[lymphangiomatosis]] and Gorham's disease should be considered as a spectrum of disease rather than separate diseases.<ref name="aviv">Aviv RI, McHugh K, Hunt J. Angiomatosis of bone and soft tissue: a spectrum of   disease from diffuse lymphangiomatosis to vanishing bone disease in young patients. Clin Radiol. 2001 Mar;56(3):184-90.</ref>

While there is consensus that Gorham's is caused by deranged osteoclastic activity,<ref name="gorham"/><ref name="moller"/><ref name="gorham2"/><ref name="johnson"/> there is not yet conclusive evidence as to what causes this deranged behavior to begin.

==Diagnosis==
In 1983 Heffez and colleagues<ref name="heffez"/> published a case report in which they suggested eight criteria for a definitive diagnosis of Gorham's disease:

*Positive [[biopsy]] with the presence of angiomatous tissue
*Absence of [[atypia|cellular atypia]]
*Minimal or no osteoblastic response or [[dystrophic calcification]]s
*Evidence of local bone progressive [[osseous]] resorption
*Non-expansile, [[Ulcerative|non-ulcerative]] lesions
*No involvement of [[viscera]]
*Osteolytic [[radiography|radiographic]] pattern
*Negative hereditary, metabolic, [[neoplastic]], immunologic, or infectious etiology.

In the early stages of the disease x-rays reveal changes resembling patchy osteoporosis. As the disease progresses bone deformity occurs with further loss of bone mass and, in the tubular bones (the long bones of the arms and legs), a [[concentric]] shrinkage is often seen which has been described as having a "sucked candy" appearance. Once the [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] (the outer shell) of the bone has been disrupted, vascular channels may invade adjacent [[soft tissues]] and joints. Eventually, complete or near-complete resorption of the bone occurs and may extend to adjacent bones, though spontaneous arrest of bone loss has been reported on occasion. Throughout this process, as the bone is destroyed it is replaced by angiomatous and/or fibrous tissue.<ref name="gorham"/><ref name="ross"/><ref name="moller"/><ref name="johnson"/><ref name="torg">Torg JS, Steel HH. Sequential roentgenographic changes occurring in massive osteolysis. J Bone Joint Surg Am 1969; 51:1649-55.</ref>

Often Gorham's disease is not recognized until a fracture occurs, with subsequent improper bone healing. The diagnosis essentially is one of exclusion and must be based on combined clinical, radiological, and [[histopathological]] findings.<ref name="moller"/> X-rays, [[CT scan]]s, [[MRI]]s, [[ultrasound]]s, and [[nuclear medicine]] (bone scans) are all important tools in the diagnostic workup and surgical planning, but none have the ability alone to produce a definitive diagnosis. Surgical biopsy with histological identification of the vascular or lymphatic proliferation within a generous section of the affected bone is an essential component in the diagnostic process.<ref name="moller"/><ref name="yalniz"/><ref name="chattopadhyay"/>

Recognition of the disease requires a high index of suspicion and an extensive workup. Because of its serious [[morbidity]], Gorham's must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions.<ref name="ross"/>

==Treatment and management==
Treatment of Gorham's disease is for the most part [[palliative]] and limited to symptom management.

Sometimes the bone destruction spontaneously ceases and no treatment is required. But when the disease is progressive, aggressive intervention may be necessary. Duffy and colleagues<ref name="duffy"/> reported that around 17% of patients with Gorham's disease in the ribs, shoulder, or upper spine experience extension of the disease into the chest, leading to [[chylothorax]] with its serious consequences, and that the mortality rate in this group can reach as high as 64% without surgical intervention.

A search of the medical literature reveals multiple case reports of interventions with varying rates of success as follows:
*'''Cardiothoracic (heart & lung):'''
**[[Pleurodesis]]
**[[Ligature (medicine)|Ligation]] of [[thoracic duct]]
**Pleurperitoneal [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]]
**[[Radiation therapy]]
**Pleurectomy
**[[Segmental resection|Surgical resection]]
**[[Thalidomide]]
**[[Interferon alpha-2b]]
**[[Parenteral nutrition|TPN]] (total parenteral nutrition)
**[[Thoracentesis]]
**Diet rich in [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s and protein
**[[Chemotherapy]]
**[[Sclerotherapy]]
**Transplantation
*'''Skeletal:'''
**Interferon alpha-2b
**[[Bisphosphonate]] (e.g. [[pamidronate]])
**Surgical resection
**Radiation therapy
**Sclerotherapy
**[[Percutaneous]] [[bone cement]]
**[[Bone graft]]
**Prosthesis
**Surgical stabilization

To date, there are no known interventions that are consistently effective for Gorham's and all reported interventions are considered experimental treatments, though many are routine for other conditions. Some patients may require a combination of these approaches. Unfortunately, some patients will not respond to any intervention.

==Epidemiology==
Gorham's disease is extremely rare and may occur at any age, though it is most often recognized in children and young adults. It strikes males and females of all races and exhibits no inheritance pattern. The medical literature contains case reports from every continent. Because it is so rare, and commonly misdiagnosed, it is not known exactly how many people are affected by this disease. The literature frequently cites that fewer than 200 cases have been reported, though there is consensus  building that there are many more cases around the world than have been reported.

==History==
The first known report of the condition came in 1838 in an article titled "A Boneless Arm" in what was then ''The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'' (now ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'').<ref name="jackson">Jackson JBS. A boneless arm. Boston Med Surg J 1838;18:368-9.</ref> It is a brief report chronicling the case of Mr. Brown who had, in 1819 at age 18 years, broken his right upper arm in an accident. The patient suffered two subsequent accidents, which fractured the arm twice more "before the curative process had been completed." At the time of the report in 1838 the patient was reported as having remarkable use of the arm, in spite of the [[humerus bone]] having apparently disappeared – x-rays did not yet exist. Thirty-four years later, in 1872, a follow-up report was published in the same journal, following Mr. Brown's death from [[pneumonia]] at the age of 70 years.<ref name="jackson2">Jackson JBS. Absorption of the humerus after fracture. Boston Med Surg J 1872;10:245-7.</ref> The patient had requested the arm "be dissected and preserved for the benefit of medical science" and this report contains a detailed pathological description of the arm and shoulder. Abnormalities of the remaining bones of the arm and shoulder are noted and the authors report that the arteries, veins, and nerves appeared normal. There is no mention of lymphatic vessels. Though several reports of similar cases were published in the interim, more than 80 years would pass before another significant report of the condition appeared in the medical literature.

Both born in 1885, Lemuel Whittington Gorham, MD, and [[Arthur Purdy Stout|Arthur Purdy Stout, MD]], had long, distinguished careers in medicine and shared a lifelong interest in pathology.<ref name=arthur>{{cite web|title=Arthur Purdy Stout Society|url=http://www.mc.uky.edu/apss/obituary.htm|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref><ref name="azur">Azur, HA. "Arthur Purdy Stout (1885–1967), a pioneer of surgical pathology: a survey of his Notes on the Education of an "Oncological" Surgical Pathologist.." Annals of Diagnostic Pathology 2.4 (1998): 271-9.

PubMed Central. Web. 2 Sep 2011.</ref> Dr. Gorham practiced and taught medicine and oncology and from the mid-1950s through the early 1960s conducted and reported the classical clinicopathological investigations of pulmonary embolism. During this time period he also authored several case series on osteolysis of bone. Dr. Stout began his career as a surgeon and became a pioneer in tumor pathology, publishing ''Human Cancer'' in 1932. This work became the model for the Atlas of Tumor Pathology project, which Stout oversaw as Chairman of the National Research Council in the 1950s. In his later years, Dr. Stout embarked on a systematic study of soft tissue tumors in children and was among the first to link cigarette smoking to [[lung cancer]].

In 1954 Gorham and three others published a two case series, with a brief review of 16 similar cases from the medical literature, that advanced the hypothesis that angiomatosis was responsible for this unusual form of massive osteolysis.<ref name="gorham2"/> That same year Gorham and Stout presented to the American Association of Physicians their paper (in abstract form), "Massive Osteolysis (Acute Spontaneous Absorption of Bone, Phantom Bone, Disappearing Bone): Its Relation to Hemangiomatosis."<ref name="gorham"/> The paper was published in its entirety in October 1955 in ''[[The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery]]'', concluding that:
#There now exists the basis for a new syndrome which is supported by a remarkable similarity of clinical and [x-ray] findings in twenty-four cases, and by an equally convincing similarity of the histological picture in eight of these, which we have personally studied.
#However it is accomplished, the progressive osteolysis is always associated with an angiomatosis of blood and sometimes of lymphatic vessels, which seemingly are responsible for it.

The most typical presentation is that of osteolysis of a single bone or the bones connected by a shared joint, such as the shoulder. Although the disease can attack any bone, the shoulder is one of the most commonly involved areas, along with the skull and pelvic girdle. Spontaneous fractures are common and may be the first sign of the disease.<ref name="moller"/> A hallmark of the disease is the lack of bone healing following fracture.
