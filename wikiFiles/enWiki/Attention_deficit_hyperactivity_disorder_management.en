'''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder management''' are the treatment options available to people with [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).

There are several effective and [[evidence-based medicine|clinically proven]] options to treat people with ADHD. [[Multimodal treatment]], that is combined [[psychopharmacology|pharmacological]] and [[behavioral therapy]], is the most effective ADHD management strategy, followed by medication alone, and then behavioral treatment.<ref name ="Jensen">{{cite journal|author=Jensen, et al.|last2=Garcia|first2=JA|last3=Glied|first3=S|last4=Crowe|first4=M|last5=Foster|first5=M|last6=Schlander|first6=M|last7=Hinshaw|first7=S|last8=Vitiello|first8=B|last9=Arnold|first9=LE|title=Cost-Effectiveness of ADHD Treatments: Findings from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=9|pages=1628–1636 (Page:1633)|year=2005|pmid=16135621|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.9.1628}} [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/162/9/1628 Free full text]</ref> However, these results have been questioned because the study from the multimodal treatment group phased out the behavioral procedure 3 months prior to the last evaluation point but continued the medication group.<ref name="Arnold, L.E. 2004 pp. 39-51">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/B:JACP.0000007579.61289.31 | last1 = Arnold | first1 = L.E. | last2 = Chuang | first2 = S. | last3 = Davies | first3 = M. | last4 = Abikoff | first4 = H.B | last5 = Conners | first5 = C.K. | last6 = Elliott | first6 = G.R. | last7 = Greenhill | first7 = L.L. | last8 = Hechtman | first8 = L. | last9 = -1#March | first9 = J.H.

On Wednesday, November 21, 2012, the online edition of the [[Peoria, Illinois]]-based [[Peoria Journal Star]] newspaper featured an [[Associated Press]] (AP) article by [[Marilynn Marchione]], with AP Medical Writer [[Maria Cheng]] contributing from London. It cited a study, published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], with [[Paul Lichtenstein]], from the [[Karolinska Institute]] in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], as lead author, which revealed that medications to treat ADHD ([[Ritalin]], [[Adderall]], and others) in adults (and older teens- over age 15) drastically lowered their likelihood of committing a crime (mainly burglary and theft, as opposed to truly violent crimes, like murder).<ref>http://www.pjstar.com/free/x719496548/Study-ADHD-medicines-help-curb-criminal-behavior</ref>

== Psychosocial ==

There are a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches employed by psychologists and  psychiatrists; the one used depends on the patient and the patient's symptoms. The approaches include psychotherapy, cognitive-behavior therapy, support groups, parent training, meditation, and social skills training. If psychotherapy fails to bring improvement, medications can be considered as an add-on or alternative.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Greydanus DE, Pratt HD, Patel DR|title=Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder across the lifespan: the child, adolescent, and adult|journal=Dis Mon|volume=53|issue=2|pages=70–131|year=2007|month=February|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2007.01.001|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0011-5029(07)00002-8|pmid=17386306}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Schlamp D|title=[My child is so restless]|language=German|journal=MMW Fortschr Med|volume=149|issue=10|pages=39–40|year=2007|month=March|pmid=17408047|doi=|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=|title=Update on drugs for hyperactivity in childhood|journal=Drug Ther Bull|volume=45|issue=5|pages=37–40|year=2007|month=May|pmid=17536494|doi=10.1136/dtb.2007.45537|url=}}</ref>

=== Psychotherapy ===

Psychotherapy is another option, with or without medication, that has been shown to be effective.<ref>Barkley, R. (2005) Take Charge of ADHD: The Complete Authoritative Guide for Parents NY: Guilford Publications</ref>

Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and [[token economy]].<ref name=AAP2001/>

=== Working memory training ===
{{Main|Working memory training}}

{{Main|Treatment of ADHD through working memory training}}

Many of the problems shown by children with ADHD can be traced back to deficits in [[working memory]] (or short-term memory). By training and improving this memory some of the other symptoms may diminish as well. In a study by Klingberg et al., a computerized training program has shown good results in working memory, even if the generalized effect to behavioural symptoms was not as clear.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00004583-200502000-00010 | last1 = Klingberg | first1 = T. | last2 = Fernell | first2 = E. | last3 = Olesen | first3 = P.J. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = M. | last5 = Gustafsson | first5 = P. | last6 = Dahlstrom | first6 = K. | year = 2005 | last7 = Gillberg | first7 = Christopher G | last8 = Forssberg | first8 = Hans | last9 = Westerberg | first9 = Helena | title = Computerized training of working memory in children with ADHD--A randomized, controlled trial | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 177–186 | pmid=15689731}}</ref>

=== Coaching ===

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
[[ADHD coaching]] is a specialized type of life coaching that uses specific techniques geared toward working with the unique brain wiring of individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Professional coaching is not considered a substitute for traditional treatment such as medication and therapy.

=== Timers ===

Timers have been found to be effective for allowing people with ADHD to concentrate more effectively on the task at hand.  When a target is set, one method is to only turn the timer on whilst working on the given task.  A physical stopwatch or an online timer may be used.

== Medications ==

[[File:Adderallrx.jpg|thumb|Adderall 25&nbsp;mg XR. Adderall XR is one of the medications used to treat ADHD.]]

=== Stimulants ===

[[Stimulants]] are the most commonly prescribed medications for ADHD. The most common stimulant medications are the chain subsitituted amphetamine [[methylphenidate]] ([[Ritalin]], [[Metadate]], [[Concerta]]), [[dexmethylphenidate]] ([[Focalin]]), [[dextroamphetamine]] ([[Dexedrine]]), [[amphetamine|mixed amphetamine salts]] ([[Adderall]]),<ref>Stephen V.

Stimulants used to treat ADHD raise the extracellular concentrations of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] which causes an increase in [[neurotransmission]]. The therapeutic benefits are due to [[noradrenergic]] effects at the [[locus coeruleus]] and the [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[dopaminergic]] effects at the [[nucleus accumbens]].<ref name="Solanto1998">{{Cite journal|author=Solanto MV |title=Neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of stimulant drug action in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a review and integration|journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=127–52 |year=1998 |month=July|pmid=9708845 |doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(97)00175-7}}</ref>

A [[meta analysis]] of clinical trials found that about 70 percent of children improve after being treated with stimulants in the short term but found that this conclusion may be biased due to the high number of low quality clinical trials in the literature. There have been no randomized placebo controlled [[clinical trials]] investigating the long term effectiveness of [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin) beyond 4 weeks. Thus the long term effectiveness of methylphenidate has not been scientifically demonstrated. Serious concerns of [[publication bias]] regarding the use of methylphenidate for ADHD has also been noted.<ref name="pmid11762571">{{Cite journal|author=Schachter HM, Pham B, King J, Langford S, Moher D |title=How efficacious and safe is short-acting methylphenidate for the treatment of attention-deficit disorder in children and adolescents?

On occasion, treatment emergent psychosis can emerge during long-term therapy with methylphenidate. Stimulants such methylphenidate should be avoided in people who have a vulnerability to [[schizophrenia]] or [[substance dependence|addiction]]; however, psychotic symptoms may emerge during therapy with methylphenidate in individuals without these risk factors; regular psychiatric monitoring of people who are taking methylphenidate for adverse effects such as [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptomatology (with regard to the need for dose adjustment or discontinuation of medication) has been recommended.<ref name="pmid20571380">{{cite journal |author=Kraemer M, Uekermann J, Wiltfang J, Kis B |title=Methylphenidate-induced psychosis in adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: report of 3 new cases and review of the literature |journal=Clin Neuropharmacol |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=204–6 |year=2010 |month=July |pmid=20571380 |doi=10.1097/WNF.0b013e3181e29174 |url=}}</ref> Higher rates of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as well as increased severity of these disorders occur in individuals with a past history of stimulant use for ADHD in childhood.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ross RG |title=Psychotic and manic-like symptoms during stimulant treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163|issue=7 |pages=1149–52 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16816217|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.7.1149}}</ref>

Both children with and without ADHD abuse stimulants, with ADHD individuals being at the highest risk of [[substance abuse|abusing]] or [[pharmaceutical diversion|diverting]] their stimulant prescriptions. Between 16 and 29 percent of students who are prescribed stimulants report diverting their prescriptions. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 15% of college students admitted to having used a psychotherapeutic drug for a purpose other than that for which it was prescribed. It also reported that 7% of the 15% said they used Adderall to party or to improve their attention span or grades.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Workman|first=T|coauthors=Eells|title=Assessing the Risks and Issues: Prescription Drug Abuse on Campus|journal=National Conference for Law and Higher Education|year=2010|url=http://www.law.stetson.edu/conferences/highered/archive/media/higher-ed-archives-2010/assessing-the-risks-and-issues.pdf.|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>

One review indicates that long-term use of methylphenidate has potential for [[substance abuse|abuse]] and [[substance dependence|addiction]] due to its similarity pharmacologically to [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]].<ref>Lerner M, Wigal T.

==== Amphetamines ====

Three different medicines derived from amphetamine are used in ADHD treatment. Their trade names are [[Adderall]] (a mixture of 72% [[amphetamine|dextroamphetamine]] and 28% [[amphetamine|levoamphetamine]]), [[Dexedrine]] (pure dextroamphetamine), and [[Desoxyn]] (pure [[dextromethamphetamine]]).<ref>{{cite journal|author=|last1=National Toxicology|first1=Program|title=NTP-CERHR monograph on the potential human reproductive and developmental effects of amphetamines|journal=Ntp Cerhr Mon|volume=|issue=16|pages=vii–III1|year=2005|month=July|pmid=16130031|doi=|url=}}</ref> The differences in these three amphetamine-based medications' active compounds and mixture ratios results in each medications' slightly different activities.

==== Levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine ====

Levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine have the same chemical formula but are [[chirality (chemistry)|mirror images of each other]], the same way that a person's hands are the same but are mirror images of each other. This mirror difference is enough to cause the two compounds to be metabolized differently. <!-- I think the rate is important, a brief description how they are metabolized would fit in nicely here. --> Adderall begins to work before dextroamphetamine because of levoamphetamine.<ref name ="Glaser">{{cite journal|author=Glaser, et al.|last2=Thomas|first2=TC|last3=Joyce|first3=BM|last4=Castellanos|first4=FX|last5=Gerhardt|first5=GA|title=Differential Effects of Amphetamine Isomers on Dopamine in the Rat Striatum and Nucleus Accumbens Core|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=178|issue=2-3|pages=250–258 (Page: 255)|year=2005|pmid=15719230|doi=10.1007/s00213-004-2012-6}}</ref> Levoamphetamine also provides Adderall with a longer clinical effect than dextroamphetamine. However, the brain’s preference for dextroamphetamine over levoamphetamine shows that the clinical value of Adderall is, for the most part, due to dextroamphetamine.<ref name ="Glaser" /> A few children with ADHD and comorbid disorders have helpful responses to levoamphetamine.<ref name="Arnold" />

==== Dextromethamphetamine ====

The body [[metabolize]]s dextromethamphetamine into dextroamphetamine (in addition to less active [[metabolite]]s). A quarter of dextromethamphetamine will ultimately become dextroamphetamine.<!--

In fact, when dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate are unhelpful, some doctors may prescribe dextromethamphetamine. Although more rarely prescribed, anecdotal reports suggest dextromethamphetamine is very helpful in cases where the other two are ineffective, or cause limiting side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dr-bob.org/tips/split/Methamphetamine-for-ADHD.html|last=Williams|first=C.

==== Methylphenidate-based medications ====

[[File:Methylphenidate-2D-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Methylphenidate]] ]]

There are two different medicines derived from [[methylphenidate]]: [[Ritalin]], which is half dextrothreomethylphenidate and half levothreomethylphenidate, that is, a mixture of the "chemical [[chirality (chemistry)|mirror images]]" of methylphenidate, and [[Focalin]], which is pure dextrothreomethylphenidate. Dextrothreomethylphenidate has a higher pharmacological activity than its mirror ''levo''-form or [[enantiomer]]. Levothreomethylphenidate has much weaker activity than the ''dextro'' isomer, and so for instance if [[Daytrana]] (methylphenidate in [[transdermal patch]] form) is used, then the levothreomethylphenidate comprising half of the administered dose, accounts for only around one thirteenth of the total clinical effect.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Heal DJ, Pierce DM|title=Methylphenidate and its isomers: their role in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder using a transdermal delivery system|journal=CNS Drugs|volume=20|issue=9|pages=713–738 (Page:730)|year=2006|pmid=16953648|doi=10.2165/00023210-200620090-00002}}</ref> [[Methylphenidate]]  has high potential for [[substance abuse|abuse]] and [[substance dependence|addiction]] due to its pharmacological similarity to [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]].<ref name="pmid11056411">{{Cite journal|author=Kidd PM |title=Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children: rationale for its integrative management |journal=Altern Med Rev |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=402–28 |year=2000 |pmid=11056411 |url=http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/5/5/402.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zhu J, Reith ME |title=Role of the dopamine transporter in the action of psychostimulants, nicotine, and other drugs of abuse |journal=CNS & Neurological Disorders Drug Targets |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=393–409 |year=2008 |pmid=19128199 |doi=10.2174/187152708786927877 |pmc=3133725}}</ref>

==== Formulations ====

[[time release technology|Controlled-release]] pharmaceuticals may allow once or twice daily administration of medication in the morning. This is especially helpful for children who do not like taking their medication in the middle of the school day. Several controlled-release methods are used.

Atomoxetine (Strattera) is less effective than stimulants for ADHD, is associated with individual cases of liver damage, carries a U.S. FDA [[black box warning]] regarding suicidal idealization.

[[Intuniv]] is an extended release form of guanfacine. Intuniv has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children as an alternative to stimulant medications. Its beneficial actions are likely due to its ability to strengthen prefrontal cortical regulation of attention and behavior.<ref>Arnsten AF.  The use of alpha-2A adrenergic agonists for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  Expert Rev Neurother.  10:1595-605, 2010</ref>

[[Clonidine]] (Kapvay), an α<sub>2A</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist has also been approved in the US. Clonidine, initially developed as a treatment for high blood pressure, low doses in evenings and/or afternoons are sometimes used in conjunction with stimulants to help with sleep and because clonidine sometimes helps moderate impulsive and oppositional behavior and may reduce [[tic]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frazin|first=Natalie|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/news_and_events/news_articles/news_article_adhd.htm|title=Methylphenidate and Clonidine Help Children With ADHD and Tics|date=2002-04-02|publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]|accessdate=2007-04-15| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070427163336/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/news_and_events/news_articles/news_article_adhd.htm|archivedate= 27 April 2007 <!-- DASHBot -->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It may be more useful for comorbid Tourette syndrome.

The use of [[atypical antipsychotic]] medication as an [[off-label]] treatment has been rising.<ref>[http://www.pharmalot.com/2008/01/florida-medicaid-to-review-antipsychotics-adhd/Pharmalot - Florida Medicaid To Review Antipsychotics & ADHD]</ref> Antipsychotics work by blocking [[dopamine]], whereas stimulants trigger its release. Atypical antipsychotics have been approved for use in children and teenagers with [[schizophrenia]] spectrum disorders and [[autistic spectrum disorders]] by the U.S. FDA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/schizophrenia/content/article/10168/1147536|title=Atypical Antipsychotics for Treatment of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders}}</ref>

Non-ADHD children do not respond differently than ADHD children when prescribed antipsychotic drugs, which are also increasingly prescribed off-label for children with aggression or defiant behavior.<ref>[http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s06/v05s0603.pdf Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.], Dosing of Atypical Antipsychotics in Children and Adolescents</ref> Social pressure to control a child's difficult and disruptive behavior, both at home and at school, may inadvertently change focus from what is in the best interest of the child's wellbeing; to how to render the child more compliant and easier to manage.

Careful approach needs to be taken when blocking dopamine function, which is responsible for the psychological [[reward system]]. Excessive blocking of this [[neurotransmitter]] can cause[[dysphoria]]. This may in turn cause [[suicidal ideation]], or lead some teenagers to compensate for their dopamine deficiency with illicit drugs or alcohol. Atypical antipsychotics are preferred for this reason, because they are less likely to cause movement disorders, dysphoria, and increased drug cravings that have been associated with older [[typical antipsychotics]].<ref>[http://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/cbhsdocs/MHPdocs/AtypicalAntipsychoticGuidelines102006.pdfDepartment of Public Health], Guidelines for the use of atypical antipsychotics in adults</ref>[[Weight gain]], [[diabetes]], [[lactation]], [[gynecomastia]], [[drooling]], [[dysphoria]], [[anhedonia]] (inability to experience pleasure), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[sexual dysfunction]], [[heart rhythm]] problems and the possibility of [[tardive dyskinesia]], an irreversible{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} movement disorder, are among the adverse events associated with antipsychotic drugs.

== Concerns regarding stimulants ==
{{Main|Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies#Concerns about medication}}

The [[National Institute of Mental Health]] states that, "stimulant drugs, when used with medical supervision, are usually considered quite safe."<ref>[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/adhd/treatment.shtml NIMH · ADHD · The Treatment of ADHD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Still, some parents and professionals have raised questions about the side effects of drugs and their long term use.<ref>Lakhan SE; Hagger-Johnson G. http://www.cpementalhealth.com/content/3/1/21 The impact of prescribed psychotropics on youth.

The [[American Heart Association]] feel that it is prudent to carefully assess children for heart conditions before treating them with stimulant medications.<ref>{{cite journal|author=&Na;,|title=American Academy of Pediatrics/American Heart Association clarification of statement on cardiovascular evaluation and monitoring of children and adolescents with heart disease receiving medications for ADHD: May 16, 2008|journal=J Dev Behav Pediatr|volume=29|issue=4|pages=335|year=2008|month=August|pmid=18698199|doi=10.1097/DBP.0b013e31318185dc14|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/117/18/2407}}</ref>

=== Increase in use ===

Outpatient treatment rates have held steady in the US recently.<ref>http://www.nimh.nih.gov/press/adhdmedsuse.cfm "ADHD Medication Use Held Steady in Recent Years" April 2006</ref> Prior to this, outpatient treatment for ADHD in the US grew from 0.9 children per 100 in 1987 to 3.4 per 100 in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.6.1071 | last1 = Name | first1 =  LM| last2 = Olfson | first2 = M | last3 = Gameroff | first3 = MJ | last4 = Marcus | first4 = SC | last5 = Jensen | first5 = PS. | year = 2003 | title = National trends in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 6| pages = 1071–1077 | pmid = 12777264 }}</ref> A survey conducted by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in 2011-2012 found 6.4 million children between the ages of 4 and 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD at some point, a 16% increase since 2007 and a 41% increase over the last decade.<ref name="ADHD Children Count">{{cite web|last=Schwarz and Cohen|title=More Diagnoses of A.D.H.D.

=== Stimulant misuse ===

There is non-medical prescription stimulant use.  A 2003 study found that non prescription use by college students in the US was 6.9% with 4.1% using them within the last year.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McCabe SE, Knight JR, Teter CJ, Wechsler H|title=Non-medical use of prescription stimulants among US college students: prevalence and correlates from a national survey|journal=Addiction (Abingdon, England)|volume=100|issue=1|pages=96–106|year=2005|month=January|pmid=15598197|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.00944.x|url=}}</ref>  A 2006 study with teens in Grades 7 to Grade 12 found that 2% reported non-medical use of prescription stimulant medication in the past 12 months, with 2% also reporting non-medical use of prescribed sedatives/and or anxiety medications, 3% using sleeping medications, and 12% reporting non-medical use of prescribed pain medications.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Boyd CJ, McCabe SE, Cranford JA, Young A|title=Adolescents' motivations to abuse prescription medications|journal=Pediatrics|volume=118|issue=6|pages=2472–2480|year=2006|month=December|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/118/6/2472|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1644|pmc=1785364|pmid=17142533}}</ref>

=== Medication in preschoolers ===

Parents of children with ADHD note that they usually display their symptoms at an early age. Dr. John Van Brakle has stated, "pediatricians have long questioned whether such children can accurately be identified, given the overlap with normal behaviors in young children."<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070821143557.htm Nonmedicinal Treatment Touted For Preschoolers With ADHD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There have been few longitudinal studies on the long-term effects psychostimulants have on children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Singh|title=Beyond Polemics: Science and Ethics of ADHD|url=http://www.adhdvoices.com/documents/Singh2008__Beyond_polemics.pdf}}</ref> The use of stimulant medication has not been approved by the FDA for children under the age of six.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061016150730.htm Preschoolers With ADHD Improve With Low Doses Of Medication<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A growing trend is the diagnosis of younger children with ADHD. Prescriptions for children under the age of 5 rose nearly 50 percent from 2000 to 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEEDF143FF934A25756C0A9629C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Behavior Drugs Lead in Sales For Children | first=Milt |last=Freudenheim | date=2004-05-17 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> Research on this issue has indicated that stimulant medication can help younger children with "severe ADHD symptoms" but typically at a lower dose then older children. It was also found that children at this age are more sensitive to side effects and should be closely monitored.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Manos states, "it is prudent for physicians to be cautious," with medications. Evidence suggests that careful assessment and highly individualized behavioural interventions significantly improve both social and academic skills while medication only treats the symptoms of the disorder.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Manos suggests that, "one of the primary reasons cited for the growing use of psychotropic interventions was that many physicians realize that psychological interventions are costly and difficult to sustain."<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/523542</ref>

=== Side effects ===

==== General Side Effects ====

The FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (MedWatch) has documented 14,158 Adverse Drug Reactions in relation to ADHD stimulants between 2004 and 2011.

* 9 cases of sexual dysfunction
* 11 cases of homicide
* 12 cases of psychosis
* 13 cases of violence-related symptoms
* 21 cases of birth defects
* 23 cases of physical Assault
* 25 cases of coma
* 30 cases of hostility
* 44 cases of diabetes
* 52 cases of homicidal ideation
* 147 cases of mania
* 220 cases of death/sudden death
* 464 cases of depression
* 495 cases of abnormal behavior
* 499 cases of anxiety
* 593 cases of hallucinations
* 636 cases of aggression
* 871 cases of suicidal ideation/behavior (completed suicides and suicide attempts)

By their own admission, only 1-10% of side effects are ever reported to the FDA so the true number of side effects that occur is far higher.<ref>{{cite web|title=ADHD Drugs-Side Effects|url=http://www.cchrint.org/psychiatric-drugs/stimulantsideeffects/|publisher=CCHR International|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

==== Growth delay and weight loss ====

The stunting of growth in children has been a concern.  Past studies suggested that "long-term use of the drugs could stunt children's growth."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7090011.stm | work=BBC News | title=Questions over drugs for ADHD |date=2007-11-12 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> A considerable amount of growth hormones (20-40%) are released during the 60-90 minute period after falling asleep. This part of the sleep cycle is suppressed by stimulants, causing a deficit of growth hormones in the body.<ref name="Risk Safety Med">{{cite journal|last=Breggin|title=Psychostimulants in the Treatment of Children Diagnosed with ADHD: Risks and Mechanism of Action|journal=International Journal of Risk & Safety in Medicine|year=1999|volume=12|pages=3–35}}</ref>  However, more recent studies suggest that children eventually do reach normal height and weight. According to Wilens (2004), treated children with ADHD tend to grow at a slower rate but catch up during adolescence and adulthood.<ref>Wilens, T.E. (2004) Straight Talk About Medications For Kids. NY: The Guilford Press.</ref> One notion is that psychostimulant medication can decrease appetite which may result in loss of weight and may be a factor in stunted growth.

==== Side effects on the brain ====

Psychostimulants have negative effects on both the gross and biochemical functions of the brain, including the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, which are involved in motor control, learning routine behaviors, motivation, and cognitive and emotional functions. Psychostimulants have also been indicated to disrupt growth hormones, which could affect brain development.<ref name="Risk Safety Med"/>
A study led by psychologist Stacy A. Castner of the Yale University School of Medicine revealed how amphetamines such Adderall can have long term effects on the mind. In the study, rhesus monkeys were given escalating injected doses of amphetamine over either six or twelve weeks. Compared to monkeys given inactive saline, the monkeys who received the drug displayed deficits in short term memory. This lasted for at least three years after they were given the drug. The researchers in this study connected this deficiency to a significantly lower level of dopamine activity in the frontal cortex.<ref name="HiggensToll">{{cite journal|last=Higgens|title=Do ADHD Drugs Take a Toll on the Brain?|journal=Scientific American Mind|year=2009|issue=20|pages=38–43}}</ref> Another study by neurologist George A. Ricaurte and his team at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine supports this idea as well and is more compelling because the amphetamine was administered by mouth, like Adderall and other psychostimulants, and given twice a day to resemble the way the dose is taken by humans. A group of baboons and squirrel monkeys drank as orange cocktail containing the amphetamines twice a day for four weeks. Two to four weeks after they had begun taking the amphetamines, the researchers on the team detected evidence of brain damage. They found lower levels of dopamine and fewer dopamine transporters on the nerve endings in the striatum, which is involved in executive functions such as planning, memory, attention, and time perception, in the animals given the amphetamines compared to those who were not.<ref name="HiggensToll"/>

==== Cardiovascular side effects ====

There is concern that [[stimulants]] and [[Atomoxetine]], which increase the heart rate and blood pressure, might cause serious cardiovascular problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4210b_06_01_Gelperin.pdf|format=PDF|title=www.fda.gov|work=|accessdate=}}</ref>

In 2007 the FDA requires all ADHD drug manufacturers to notify patients about serious cardiovascular side effects.  This was due to reports of sudden death in children taking these medications who had underlying heart problems and of high risk adults who suffered [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108849.htm|title=FDA News|accessdate=2009-08-14|work=|publisher=FDA|date=February 21, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090827170006/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108849.htm| archivedate= 27 August 2009 <!-- DASHBot -->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Studies indicated that, "the rate of sudden death of children taking ADHD medications do not appear to exceed the base rate of sudden death in the general population". Matthew Smith is purported to have died at age 14 after long-term use of Ritalin. The medical examiner determined that Smith died from Ritalin usage, but medical experts dispute this. The examiner also argued that it was  likely that [[diabetes|diabetic]] children were at higher risk for cardiac problems.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/04/18/national/main185425.shtml |work=CBS News | title=Questions Raised Over Ritalin | date=2000-04-18}}</ref>

==== Psychiatric side effects ====

In 2006 the FDA examined the occurrence of psychiatric side effects in ADHD medication.  They found increased rates of [[psychosis]] and or [[mania]] with all drug treatments examined, including: [[Concerta]], [[Ritalin]] LA, d-MPH, [[Atomoxetine]], [[Adderall]] XR, [[Modafinil]], MTS, and [[Metadate]].<ref name="fda.gov" />

Sleep problems may occur,<ref>Silver, Larry M.D. [http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/957.html ADHD Medications: Say No to Side Effects],''ADDitude'' magazine, February 2006.</ref> but can also be an [[DSPD|extremely common side-effect]] of ADHD itself.

Many of these drugs are associated with physical and psychological dependence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4210b_16_01_ADHD%20Drug%20Labels.pdf|format=PDF|title=www.fda.gov|work=|accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Issues with long-term use of stimulant medication ===

The short term use of stimulant medication has been shown to be effective yet its long term effects are yet to be determined. The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD concluded that while drugs such as Ritalin and Concerta (a delayed release form of Ritalin) worked in the short term, there was no demonstrable improvement in children's behavior after three years of medication."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,310596,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Report: ADHD Drugs May Stunt Growth, Long-Term Effectiveness Unknown | date=2007-11-12}}</ref> A long-term study by Swanson et al. treated nearly 600 children in the 1990’s for fourteen months to compare methylphenidate (the active ingredient in Ritalin) verses behavioral treatment. The study consisted of three groups: medication only, behavioral treatment only, and a combination of both. Although it was found that medication was more effective in reducing symptoms, 54% of the medication-alone group required a dose increase of on average 19% per unit of body weight. In a follow-up to the study, the children in the medication-only group reported having lost half of the benefit of medication by the end of two-years, and all of it by the end of three years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts on ADHD Medications|url=http://www.childmind.org/en/posts/articles/2012-4-16-facts-adhd-medications|publisher=Child Mind Institute|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> Similar results were found in a two-year study in 2005 of 200 children taking Concerta, a delay-release form of methylphenidate. Medication was effective through the second year, but only if the dosage was increased 15% on averaged per unit of body weight.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts on ADHD Medications|url=http://www.childmind.org/en/posts/articles/2012-4-16-facts-adhd-medications|publisher=Child Mind Institute|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

While ADHD is associated with an increased risk of [[substance abuse]], stimulant medications have been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent development of [[substance abuse]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Faraone SV, Wilens TE |title=Effect of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on later substance use and the potential for stimulant misuse, abuse, and diversion |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=68 Suppl 11 |issue= |pages=15–22 |year=2007 |pmid=18307377 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilens TE, Faraone SV, Biederman J, Gunawardene S |title=Does stimulant therapy of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder beget later substance abuse?

=== Long term use and schizophrenia and drug induced psychosis ===

Although the safety profile of short-term methylphenidate therapy in clinical trials has been well established, repeated use of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate is less clear. The long term effects of methylphenidate in [[drug addiction]], [[withdrawal]] reactions, [[psychosis]], [[clinical depression|depression]], and [[pregnancy]] has received very little research and thus the long term effects of using stimulants for ADHD are largely unknown. There are no well defined withdrawal schedules for discontinuing long term use of stimulants.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ashton H, Gallagher P, Moore B|title=The adult psychiatrist's dilemma: psychostimulant use in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder|journal=J.

Family history of mental illness does not predict the incidence of stimulant toxicosis in ADHD children. High rates of childhood stimulant use are found in ADHD patients who will eventually be diagnosed with [[comorbid]] [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] disorder.

== History ==

The first reported evidence of stimulant medication used to treat children with concentration and hyperactivity problems came in 1937.<ref>http://www.healthcentral.com/adhd/c/7930/23979/adhds-history-effects</ref> Dr. [[Charles Bradley M.D.|Charles Bradley]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] reported that a group of children with behavioral problems improved after being treated with the stimulant [[Benzedrine]].<ref>[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/155/7/968  ''Charles Bradley, M.D., 1902–1979''], retrieved September 15, 2008. American Journal of Psychiatry, 155:968</ref>  In 1957, the stimulant [[methylphenidate]] ([[Ritalin]], which was first produced in 1950) became available; it remains one of the most widely prescribed medications for ADHD. Initially the drug was used to treat [[narcolepsy]], chronic fatigue, depression, and to counter the sedating effects of other medications. The drug began to be used for ADHD in the 1960s and steadily rose in use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 1975, [[pemoline]] (Cylert) was approved by the U.S. FDA for use in the treatment of ADHD. While an effective agent for managing the symptoms, the development of liver failure in 14 cases over the next 27 years would result in the manufacturer withdrawing this medication from the market. New delivery systems for medications were invented in 1999 that eliminated the need for multiple doses across the day or taking medication at school. These new systems include pellets of medication coated with various time-release substances to permit medications to dissolve hourly across an 8&ndash;12 hour period (Metadate CD, Adderall XR, Focalin XR) and an osmotic pump that extrudes a liquid methylphenidate sludge across an 8&ndash;12 hour period after ingestion (Concerta).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 2003, [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera) received the first FDA approval for a nonstimulant drug to be used specifically for ADHD. In 2007, [[lisdexamfetamine]] (Vyvanse) becomes the first [[prodrug]] to receive FDA approval for ADHD.

In 1999 the largest study of treatment for ADHD was published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]''. Known as the ''Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD'' (MTA Study), it involved more than 570 children with ADHD at 6 sites in the United States and Canada randomly assigned to 4 [[treatment groups]]. All 4 treatment groups showed marked improvement from the time of baseline measurements to completion of the study 14 months later. Behavioral treatment was as effective as medication alone on 16 of 19 outcome measures.<ref name="meta.wkhealth.com" /> This was especially good for the behavior modification group, since the behavioral protocols were faded 3 months prior to the last evaluation and the stimulant group continued to receive medication right up to the last evaluation point.<ref name="Arnold, L.E. 2004 pp. 39-51"/>

== Alternative medicine ==

Some proponents of alternative medicine advocate that alternative therapies may be tried before ADHD medications, although not all ADHD children will have any effective response.<ref name="pmid11056411" />

=== Neurofeedback ===

[[Neurofeedback]] (NF) or EEG biofeedback is a treatment strategy used for children, adolescents and adults with ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Greydanus DE, Pratt HD, Patel DR |title=Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder across the lifespan: the child, adolescent, and adult |journal=Disease-a-month |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=70–131 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17386306|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2007.01.001}}</ref> Neurofeedback, is effective in treating [[attention]], [[impulsivity]] and [[hyperactivity]].It is based on four principles: Recognizing how the mind (perceptions) and body (physical responses) interact, recognizing that the mind and body try to reach homeostasis, recognizing that cognitive control can help physiologic control, and being interested in learning skills to create homeostasis.<ref name="UMHS Alt Treat">{{cite web|title=Biofeedback: Your Child: University of Michigan Health System|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/biofeed.htm|publisher=University of Michigan Health System}}</ref>

No serious adverse side effects from nerofeedback have been reported. A few short-term effects have been reported including periods of negative feelings, and fatigue or dizziness when going through the treatment, but these are rare.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Neurofeedback or Neurotherapy?|url=http://bio-medical.com/news/2008/01/what-is-neurofeedback-or-neurotherapy/}}</ref>  Research into neurofeedback has been limited and further research has been recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Holtmann M, Stadler C, Leins U, Strehl U, Birbaumer N, Poustka F|title=[Neurofeedback for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood and adolescence]|language=German|journal=Z Kinder Jugendpsychiatr Psychother|volume=32|issue=3|pages=187–200|year=2004|month=July|pmid=15357015|doi=10.1024/1422-4917.32.3.187|url=}}</ref>
One 2009 study concluded "that NF may be considered as a clinically effective module in the treatment of children with ADHD"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gevensleben H, Holl B, Albrecht B, Vogel C, Schlamp D, Kratz O, Studer P, Rothenberger A, Moll G H, Heinrich H|title=[Is neurofeedback an efficacious treatment for ADHD?

Neurofeedback alerts the patient when beta waves are present. This theory believes that those with ADHD can train themselves to decrease ADHD symptoms. There is a distinct split in the scientific community about the effectiveness of the treatment. A number of studies indicate the scientific evidence has been increasing in recent years for the effectiveness of EEG biofeedback for the treatment of ADHD. According to a 2007 review, the effectiveness of the treatment was demonstrated to be equivalent to that of stimulant medication. The review noted that improvements are seen at the behavioral and neuropsychological level with the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, showing significant decreases after treatment. There are no known side effects from EEG biofeedback therapy. There are methodological limitations and weaknesses in study designs however. In a 2005 review, Loo and Barkley stated that problems including lack of blinding such as placebo control and randomization are significant limitations to the studies into neurofeedback and make definitive conclusions impossible to make.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loo SK, Barkley RA |title=Clinical utility of EEG in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=Appl Neuropsychol |volume=12 |issue=2|pages=64–76 |year=2005 |pmid=16083395 |doi=10.1207/s15324826an1202_2 |url=}}</ref> As a result more robust clinical studies have been strongly recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Holtmann M, Stadler C |title=Electroencephalographic biofeedback for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood and adolescence |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=533–40 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16623652 |doi=10.1586/14737175.6.4.533}}</ref> A study by Fuchs and colleges evaluating the effectiveness of neurotherapy to stimulant medication gave evidence to the comparable effectiveness of neurofeedback to stimulant medication. Fuchs assigned 22 children from a Social-Pediatric Hospital whose ages were between 8 and 12 and who were diagnosed with ADHD to receive thirty 45-minute sessions of neurofeedback over ten weeks. A control group consisting of 11 children equitable sex and age was medicated with methylphenidate. Each group was given an IQ test, T.O.V.A, paper pencil (d2) and IOWA Conners Behavior test before and after the treatment. The children in both groups improved significantly on all tests.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuchs|title=Attention And Neurofeedback - EEG Education and Research.

=== Media ===

Other sources, including some psychologists who have written on the subject{{Who|date=May 2012}}, feel that cutting down on time spent on television, video games, or violent media can help some children. For example, one study indicated a correlation between excessive TV time as a child with higher rates of ADHD symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zimmerman FJ, Christakis DA |title=Associations between content types of early media exposure and subsequent attentional problems|journal=Pediatrics |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=986–92 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17974735 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-3322}}</ref> However, parents have long argued that their ADHD children have little to no attention problems while sitting in front of the television or playing video games for extended time periods. Indeed, studies support the idea that playing video games is a form of neurofeedback, which helps those with ADHD self-regulate and improve learning,at a neural level.<ref>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-03-09-game-therapy_x.htm</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Butnik S.M. | year = 2005 | title = Neurofeedback in adolescents and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 621–625 }}</ref> ADHD children may feel more control while playing casual video games, thereby building their confidence. However, these findings are specific to very controlled conditions, from the types of video games studied to the administrator of the tests, who are trained to carefully measure brain waves.  Therefore, it is not likely that these effects would generalize to every video game or context. It is also important to note that although symptoms may be controlled during game play, children with ADHD may experience great difficulty disengaging from the game, which may in turn negate any benefits gained from these activities,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Shaw R., Grayson A., Lewis V. | year = 2000 | title = Inhibition, ADHD, and computer games: The inhibitory performance of children and ADHD on computerized tasks and games. | journal = Journal of Attention Disorders | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 160–168 }}</ref> and time management skills may be negatively impacted as well.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tolchinsky A., Jefferson, S.D. | year = 2011 | title = Problematic video game play in a college sample and its relationship to time management skills and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder symptomology |  journal = Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking | volume = 14 | issue = 9| pages = 489–496 }}</ref> In addition, researchers caution parents against abandoning traditional treatment options for replacement with video gaming.

=== Dietary supplements ===

[[Dietary supplement]]s and specialized diets are sometimes used by people with ADHD with the intent to mitigate some or all of the symptoms.

* [[Potassium]] - In 2007, Harvard-associated researchers described [[Hypokalemic sensory overstimulation|a form of ADHD]] that was well treated with over-the-counter [[potassium]] supplements.  The molecular mechanism suggested by the authors was one producing sensory overstimulation, often triggered by ingesting carbohydrates, suggesting that people with ADHD who have sensitivity to sugar may be particularly likely to have this variant. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* [[Melatonin]] and [[modafinil]] (Provigil), as well as [[sleep hygiene|careful daily sleep practices]] and [[light therapy]], are sometimes used to treat the [[sleep disorder]]s such as [[Delayed sleep phase disorder|delayed sleep]] often associated with ADHD. ADHD itself has genetic commonality with the genes responsible for the human [[body clock]] ( or [[circadian rhythm]]) and poor sleep and ADHD each increase the severity of the other; melatonin itself is a natural [[neurohormone]] responsible partly and in tiny amounts for the human body clock.

== Comorbid disorders ==

Because ADHD comorbidities are diverse and the rate of comorbidity is high, special care must dedicated to certain comorbidities. The FDA is not set up to address this issue, and does not approve medications for comorbidities, nonetheless certain such topics have been extensively researched.

=== Tic disorders ===

Patients with [[Tourette syndrome]] who are referred to specialty clinics have a high rate of comorbid ADHD. Patients who have ADHD along with [[tic]]s or [[tic disorder]]s may also have problems with disruptive behaviors, overall functioning, and [[cognitive]] function, accounted for by the comorbid ADHD.<ref>Sukhodolsky DG, Scahill L, Zhang H, ''et al.''

The treatment of ADHD in the presence of tic disorders has long been a controversial topic.  Past medical practice held that [[stimulants]] (such as [[Ritalin]]) could not be used in the presence of tics, due to concern that their use might worsen tics;<ref name=FreemanBlog>Freeman, RD.

PMID 10103294</ref>   Several studies have shown that stimulants do not exacerbate tics any more than placebo does, and suggest that stimulants may even reduce tic severity.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11865128 | last1 = Tourette's Syndrome Study  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | first1 = Group | title = Treatment of ADHD in children with tics: a randomized controlled trial. | journal = Neurology| volume=58 | issue=4 | year=2002 | month=February | pages=527–36}}</ref>  Controversy remains, and the [[Physicians' Desk Reference|PDR]] continues to carry a warning that stimulants should not be used in the presence of tic disorders, so physicians may be reluctant to use them.  Others are comfortable using them and even advocate for a stimulant trial when ADHD co-occurs with tics, because the symptoms of ADHD can be more impairing than tics.<ref name=FreemanBlog/><ref name=Zinner2000>{{cite journal | pmid = 11077021 | last1 = Zinner  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | first1 = SH | title = Tourette disorder. | journal = Pediatrics in review / American Academy of Pediatrics| volume=21 | issue=11 | year=2000 | month=November | pages=372–83}}</ref>

The stimulants are the first line of treatment for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders.<ref name=Assessment>{{cite journal | pmid = 16554257  | author-separator =, | last1 = Scahill | author-name-separator=  | first1 = L| doi=10.1016/j.nurx.2006.01.009 | last2 = Erenberg | first2 = G | last3 = Berlin Jr | first3 = CM | last4 = Budman | first4 = C | last5 = Coffey | first5 = BJ | last6 = Jankovic | first6 = J | last7 = Kiessling | first7 = L | last8 = King | first8 = RA | last9 = Kurlan | first9 = R | title = Contemporary assessment and pharmacotherapy of Tourette syndrome. | journal = NeuroRx : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics | volume=3 | issue=2 | year=2006 | month=April | pages=192–206}}</ref>  Current prescribed stimulant medications include: [[methylphenidate]] (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), [[dextroamphetamine]] (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts ([[Adderall]]).  Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option.  These include the alpha-2 agonists ([[clonidine]] and [[guanfacine]]), [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s ([[desipramine]] and [[nortriptyline]]), and newer antidepressants ([[bupropion]] and [[venlafaxine]]. There have been case reports of tics worsening with [[bupropion]] (brand name Wellbutrin).  There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of [[desipramine]], [[bupropion]] and [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera).<ref name=Assessment/>
