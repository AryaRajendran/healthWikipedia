'''Pain wind-up''' is the perceived increase in [[pain]] intensity over time when a given painful stimulus is delivered repeatedly above a critical rate. It is caused by repeated stimulation of [[group C nerve fiber|group C peripheral nerve fibers]], leading to progressively increasing electrical response in the corresponding spinal cord ([[posterior horn of spinal cord|posterior horn]]) neurons.<ref name="XuLu2011">{{cite book|author1=Feng Xu|author2=Tianjian Lu|title=Introduction to Skin Biothermomechanics and Thermal Pain|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fMggKzt8ofoC&pg=PA347|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=29 May 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-13201-8|page=347}}</ref>
