{{Euthanasia}}
A '''euthanasia device''' is a machine engineered to allow an individual to die quickly with minimal pain. The most common devices are those designed to help [[terminally ill]] people die by [[voluntary euthanasia]] or [[assisted suicide]] without prolonged [[pain]]. They may be operated by a second party, such as a [[physician]], or by the person wishing to die. There is an ongoing debate on the [[ethics]] of euthanasia and the use of euthanasia devices.

==Notable devices==
===Thanatron===
Invented by [[Dr. Jack Kevorkian]], this device involved an individual pushing a button that released drugs or chemicals that would end his or her own life. Two deaths were assisted by means of this device, which delivered the euthanizing drugs mechanically through an [[Intravenous therapy|IV]]. Kevorkian called it a "Thanatron" or death machine ''(see [[Thanatos]])''. 

It had three canisters or bottles mounted on a metal frame, about {{convert|6|in|mm}} wide by {{convert|18|in|mm}} high. Each bottle had a [[syringe]] that connected to a single IV line in the person's arm. The first bottle contained ordinary [[saline (medicine)|saline]], or salt water. Another contained a sleep-inducing [[barbiturate]] called [[sodium thiopental]], and the third a lethal mixture of [[potassium chloride]], which immediately stopped the heart, and [[pancuronium bromide]], a muscle relaxant to prevent spasms during the dying process. (These are the three drugs administered in the [[lethal injection]] execution protocol, but in the execution protocol, the pancuronium bromide is administered before the potassium chloride.)

#Kevorkian or an assistant begins the saline solution flow.
#The person who wants to die must deliver the barbiturates by throwing a switch, pushing a button or pulling a string.
#After that, either a timer or a mechanical device triggered by the person's falling arm as the drugs take effect starts the lethal drug flowing. The idea is for the deadly chemicals to enter the bloodstream only after the person is asleep. [[Death]] usually occurred within two minutes.

===Mercitron===
Kevorkian assisted others with a device that employed a [[gas]] mask fed by a canister of [[carbon monoxide]] which was called "Mercitron" (mercy machine).  This became necessary because Kevorkian's medical license had been revoked after the first two deaths, and he could no longer have legal access to the substances required for the "Thanatron".  It was a rudimentary device consisting of a canister of [[carbon monoxide]] attached to a face mask with a tube.  A valve must be released to start the gas flowing. Depending on the person's disability, a makeshift handle may be attached to the valve to make it easier to turn. Or, with the valve in the "open" position, a clip or clothespin could be clamped on the tubing. Pulling it off allows the gas to flow. By Kevorkian's estimates, this method took 10 minutes or longer. Sometimes he encouraged people to take sedatives or muscle relaxants to keep them calm as they breathed deeply of the gas. 

Carbon monoxide is hazardous to others who may discover the body (family, medical workers, police).<ref name="PMID=7595295">{{cite journal |last1=Risser |first1=D |last2=Bönsch |first2=A |last3=Schneider |first3=B |title=Should coroners be able to recognize unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths immediately at the death scene? |journal=Journal of forensic sciences |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=596–8 |year=1995 |pmid=7595295}}</ref>

===Deliverance machine===
[[File:Euthanasia machine (Australia).JPG|thumb|340px|The '''Deliverance Machine''' was invented by Dr Philip Nitschke. Terminally-ill Australians used it to end their lives with a lethal dose of drugs after they answered "yes" to a series of questions on the laptop screen. This procedure was legal in Australia's [[Northern Territory]] between 1995 and 1997.]]

The "Deliverance Machine" was invented by [[Philip Nitschke]]. It consisted of a notebook computer and software titled "Deliverance", which asks the patient a series of questions, and automatically administers a [[lethal injection]] of [[barbiturate]]s if the correct answers are made.<ref>

An interview with Philip Nitschke, the other “Dr. Death.”
By Kathryn Jean Lopez, NR associate editor
June 5, 2001</ref> Dr. Nitschke named several reasons why he developed the machine. Even if it would have been legally possible for a doctor to administer a lethal injection, he preferred that the patient initiate the process. The machine also allowed a doctor to leave the patient with the family when the button was pushed.

The machine was used legally under the Australian [[Northern Territory]]'s [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995]], which was later overturned.

===Exit's euthanasia device===
The [[EXIT (Australia)|Exit International]] euthanasia device was invented by Dr [[Philip Nitschke]] in 2008. It used an ordinary [[barbecue]] gas bottle filled with [[nitrogen]],<ref>

</ref> a [[suicide bag|plastic suicide bag]], and some plastic tubing with one end attached to the gas canister and the other fixed inside the bag by a tie held by adhesive tape.<ref name="pph" /> In December 2008, Nitschke released details of the euthanasia device to the media. His new device/method is a modification of the "Exit Bag plus helium" method described in ''[[The Peaceful Pill Handbook]]''. Instead of using a pre-packaged disposable cylinder of helium, he suggested filling purchased empty [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] cylinders (rated at 3300 [[kPa]]) with compressed nitrogen and then regulating this with a jet assembly to give a flow of around 10 litres per minute into the standard plastic "Exit Bag". This equipment has some small advantages over the helium method:
*Larger amounts of nitrogen are available and flow rates last longer. 
*The gas is more [[physiology|physiological]], with no chance of adverse reaction (helium is reported to cause some twitching<ref>

</ref> during death);
*If there is any leakage in the period of storage of the cylinder, it can be topped up at any time to the recommended {{convert|400|psi|kPa}}. The helium party balloon cylinders cannot be refilled and, if they leak over time, must be discarded.

Nitschke called it "flawless" and "undetectable", saying the new process uses ordinary household products available from hardware stores.<ref name="deathmachine">

Nitschke said: "So it's extremely quick and there are no drugs. Importantly this doesn't fail – it's reliable, peaceful, available and with the additional benefit of undetectability." However, Nitschke commented in 2010 that if helium is used, new [[autopsy]] tests can detect it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/14/2792176.htm?section=australia |title=Test detects suicides from natural deaths - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=2010-01-15 }}</ref>

The principle behind the effectiveness of the device is [[oxygen]] deprivation that leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[asphyxia]] and death within minutes. Deprivation of oxygen in the presence of [[carbon dioxide]] creates panic and a sense of [[suffocation]] (the [[hypercapnia|hypercapnic]] alarm response), and struggling even when unconscious, whereas anoxia in the presence of an [[inert gas]], like [[nitrogen]], [[helium]] or [[argon]], does not. Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) weighs 28 [[Molar mass|g/mol]], about the same as air, whereas carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) weighs 44 [[Molar mass|g/mol]], and will tend to fall out of the bag. 

The basic principle of autoeuthanasia by anoxia was first described in the book ''[[Final Exit]]'' by [[Derek Humphry]] in 1991, although the newer technique that uses inert gases to reduce time taken to die to about five minutes was first discussed in the third edition of Humphry's book.<ref name=Humphry1991>{{Cite book

Close contact with an enclosed inert gas is lethal because it flushes oxygen from the body, but released into the open air, it quickly disperses, and is safe for others. It is neither flammable nor explosive.<ref name="Humphry1991" /> Close contact with the gas is achieved in Humphry's book by enclosing the head in a [[suicide bag]] — a strong, clear plastic bag of dimensions {{convert|22|in|mm}} by {{convert|36|in|mm}}, secured around the neck by a strap,<ref>[[Derek Humphry|Humphry, D.]] 1991: "...a small strap, which reaches around the neck and can be fastened with Velcro at either end, or strong ribbon, which goes around the neck with Velcro sewn into the ends, or even ties easily into a knot. Large rubber bands or panty hose firmly but not harshly around the neck will do. It does not have to be completely airtight"</ref> or by using a product available from the ''Canadian Right to Die Society'' called the "EXIT bag", which has a sewn-in [[Velcro]] collar and fastened-in, flexible plastic tubing. In all cases, the inert gas is fed into the bag by plastic tubing.

Suicides using this method are well documented in the literature. In the study ''Asphyxial suicide with helium and a plastic bag'' (Ogden et al.),<ref name="pmid12198347">{{cite journal |last1=Ogden |first1=Russel D. |last2=Wooten |first2=Rae H. |title=Asphyxial Suicide with Helium and a Plastic Bag |journal=American Journal of Forensic Medicine & Pathology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=234–7 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12198347 |doi=10.1097/01.PAF.0000022963.33157.9B |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-7910&volume=23&issue=3&spage=234}}</ref> the authors describe the following case history:

<blockquote><span style="font-size:90%">'''CASE REPORT'''<br>
This death occurred in September 2000, in [[South Carolina]]. The deceased was a 60-year-old white woman with a diagnosis of [[adenoid cystic carcinoma]] that had spread to the eye, causing double vision. ... Her husband discovered her on the living room floor approximately 2 hours after she was last seen alive. She wore a surgical mask over her face, and a clear plastic bag was secured over her head. ... Next to her body was an industrial refillable tank labeled “[[helium]].” A clear plastic hose was attached to the tank valve and led to the plastic bag. Also at the scene were the book ''[[Final Exit]]'', ''Final Exit: The Video'', and the ''Spring 2000 [[Hemlock Society]] Newsletter'', which included an article on helium and plastic bag suicide. The decedent appeared to have diligently followed the instructions in these materials. ... The deceased’s skin color was unremarkable, and there were no external signs of poisoning. Toxicologic examination of blood and urine for therapeutic and abused substances did not reveal data of significance .... When a person breathes inside a plastic bag filled with helium, unconsciousness will occur almost immediately, and death will ensue in minutes.</span></blockquote>

Dr Nitschke said the suicide device will prolong the lives of the terminally ill by making them feel in control of their future. "That idea of giving people access to a means of feeling that they're back in control of this issue is actually a way of prolonging life. It may seem paradoxical, but what we find is when people feel that they're back in control, they're less likely to do desperate things in desperate ways and people are always doing desperate things in desperate ways and ending their lives."<ref>
