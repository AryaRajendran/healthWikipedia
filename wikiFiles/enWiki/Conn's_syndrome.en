'''Conn syndrome''' is an [[aldosterone]]-producing [[adenoma]]. Conn's syndrome is named after [[Jerome W. Conn]] (1907–1994), the [[United States|American]] [[endocrinologist]] who first described the condition at the University of Michigan in 1955.<ref name=conn>{{cite journal |author=Conn JW, Louis LH |title=Primary aldosteronism: a new clinical entity |journal=Trans.

==Causes==
Primary [[hyperaldosteronism]] has many causes, including adrenal [[hyperplasia]] and adrenal [[carcinoma]].<ref>http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec13/ch164/ch164e.html</ref>

The syndrome is due to:
* Bilateral (micronodular) adrenal hyperplasia, 40%
* Adrenal (Conn) [[adrenal adenoma |adenoma]], 60%
* Glucocorticoid-remediable hyperaldosteronism ([[dexamethasone]]-suppressible hyperaldosteronism), <1%
* rare forms, including disorders of the [[renin-angiotensin system]], <1%<ref> Longo, Dan L et al (2012). Harrison's Principals of Internal Medicine, Vol. 2. New York: McGraw-Hill. p. 2949. ISBN 978-0-07-174887-2.</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
Aldosterone has effects on most or all cells of the body but, clinically, the most important actions are on cells of the late distal tubule and medullary collecting duct.  In the principal cells aldosterone increases activity of basolateral membrane [[sodium-potassium ATPase]] and apical epithelial sodium channels, [[ENaC]], as well as potassium channels, [[ROMK]].  These actions increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion.  Since more sodium is reabsorbed than potassium secreted, it also makes the lumen more electrically negative, causing chloride to follow sodium.  Water then follows sodium and chloride by osmosis.  In Conn syndrome these actions cause increased extracellular sodium and fluid volume and reduced extracellular potassium.  Aldosterone also acts on intercalated cells to stimulate an apical proton ATPase, acidifying urine and alkalizing extracellular fluid.

Finer notes on aldosterone include the fact that it stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase in muscle cells, increasing intracellular potassium and also increases sodium reabsoption all along the intestine and nephron, possibly due to widespread stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase.  Finally, epithelial cells of sweat gland ducts and distal colon surface respond exactly the same as the principal cells of the nephron.  These responses are important in climate adaptation and as a cause of constipation with elevated aldosterone.  

The high [[pH]] of the blood makes [[calcium in biology|calcium]] less available to the tissues and causes symptoms of [[hypocalcemia]] (low calcium levels).

The sodium retention leads to plasma volume expansion and elevated blood pressure. The increased blood pressure will lead to an increased [[glomerular filtration rate]] and cause a decrease in [[renin]] release from the granular cells of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] in the kidney. If a patient is thought to suffer from primary hyperaldosteronism, the aldosterone:renin activity ratio is used to assess this.  The decreased renin levels and in turn the reactive down-regulation of [[angiotensin II]] are thought to be unable to down-regulate the constitutively formed aldosterone, thus leading to an elevated [plasma aldosterone:plasma renin activity] ratio (lending the assay to be a clinical tool for diagnostic purposes).

Aside from hypertension, other manifesting problems include myalgias, weakness, and chronic headaches.  The [[myalgia|muscle cramps]] are due to neuron hyperexcitability seen in the setting of hypocalcemia, [[muscle weakness]] secondary to hypoexcitability of skeletal muscles in the setting of low blood potassium (hypokalemia), and [[headache]]s which are thought to be due to both electrolyte imbalance ([[hypokalemia]]) and hypertension.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism is often related to decreased [[cardiac output]], which is associated with elevated renin levels.

==Diagnosis==
Measuring aldosterone alone is not considered adequate to diagnose primary hyperaldosteronism. The screening test of choice for diagnosis is the plasma aldosterone:plasma renin activity ratio.  Renin activity, not simply plasma renin level, is assayed.  Both [[renin]] and aldosterone are measured, and a ratio greater than 30 is indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tiu S, Choi C, Shek C, Ng Y, Chan F, Ng C, Kong A |title=The use of aldosterone-renin ratio as a diagnostic test for primary hyperaldosteronism and its test characteristics under different conditions of blood sampling |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=72–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15483077 |doi=10.1210/jc.2004-1149}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ubht.nhs.uk/pathology/ChemicalPathology/TestProtocols/16Renin.html United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust, the major teaching trust in South West England<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
Hyperaldosteronism can be mimicked by [[Liddle syndrome]], and by ingestion of [[liquorice]] and other foods containing [[glycyrrhizin]].  In one case report, hypertension and [[quadriparesis]] resulted from [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] with a nonalcoholic [[pastis]] (an [[anise]]-flavored [[aperitif]] containing [[glycyrrhizinic acid]]).<ref name="pmid6623028">{{cite journal

==Therapy==
In patients with a single benign tumor (adenoma), surgical removal (adrenalectomy) may be curative. This is usually performed laparoscopically, through several very small incisions. For patients with hyperplasia of both glands, successful treatment is often achieved with [[spironolactone]] or [[eplerenone]], drugs that block the effect of aldosterone. In males, one common side effect of spironolactone drug therapy sometimes seen is [[gynecomastia]].  Gynecomastia usually does not occur with eplerenone drug therapy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Prognosis==
In the absence of proper treatment, individuals with hyperaldosteronism often suffer from poorly controlled high blood pressure, which may be associated with increased rates of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is excellent.<ref>[http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/cs/pat/adrenal/hyperaldosteronism.html Columbia Adrenal Center, Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)]</ref>
