'''Deep sleep therapy''' ('''DST'''), also called prolonged sleep treatment or continuous narcosis, is a [[psychiatric]] treatment based on the use of [[psychiatric drugs]] to render patients unconscious for a period of days or weeks.

==History==
Induction of [[sleep]] for psychiatric purposes was first tried by [[Scotland|Scottish]] psychiatrist Neil Macleod at the turn of the 20th century. He used [[bromide]] sleep in a few psychiatric patients, one of whom died. His method was adopted by some other physicians but soon abandoned, perhaps because it was considered too toxic or reckless. In 1915, Giuseppe Epifanio tried barbiturate-induced sleep therapy in a psychiatric clinic in [[Italy]], but his reports made little impact.<ref>E. Shorter 1996 "The beginning of psychopharmacology: deep sleep therapies". ''European Psychiatry'' '''11''': 236s</ref>

Deep sleep therapy was popularized in the 1920s by Swiss psychiatrist [[Jakob Klaesi]], using a combination of two [[barbiturates]] marketed as Somnifen by [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]].<ref>G.

Sargant and E. Slater 1944 An introduction to physical methods of treatment in psychiatry. Edinburgh: 100-110</ref> It was adopted and promoted by some leading psychiatrists in the 1950s and 1960s, such as [[William Sargant]] in the [[UK]] and by [[Donald Ewen Cameron]], a North American psychiatrist of Scottish origin practicing in [[Canada]], some of whose research was funded by the CIA as part of their [[Project MKULTRA]].<ref>E. Shorter 1997, 206-207</ref> 

Sargant wrote in his standard textbook ''An introduction to physical methods of treatment in psychiatry'':
<blockquote>"Many patients unable to tolerate a long course of [[electro-convulsive therapy|ECT]], can do so when anxiety is relieved by narcosis ... What is so valuable is that they generally have no memory about the actual length of the treatment or the numbers of ECT used ... After 3 or 4 treatments they may ask for ECT to be discontinued because of an increasing dread of further treatments. Combining sleep with ECT avoids this ... All sorts of treatment can be given while the patient is kept sleeping, including a variety of drugs and ECT [which] together generally induce considerable memory loss for the period under narcosis. As a rule the patient does not know how long he has been asleep, or what treatment, even including ECT, he has been given. Under sleep ... one can now give many kinds of physical treatment, necessary, but often not easily tolerated. We may be seeing here a new exciting beginning in psychiatry and the possibility of a treatment era such as followed the introduction of anaesthesia in surgery".<ref>William Sargant and Eliot Slater assisted by Desmond Kelly, ''An introduction to physical methods of treatment in psychiatry'' (Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 1972), pp. 89-96.</ref></blockquote>

==Australian Chelmsford scandal==
Deep sleep therapy was also notoriously practised (in combination with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and other therapies) by [[Harry Bailey]] between 1962 and 1979 in [[Sydney]], at the Chelmsford Private Hospital. As practised by Bailey, deep sleep therapy involved long periods of [[barbiturate]]-induced unconsciousness. DST was prescribed for various conditions ranging from [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression|depression]] to [[obesity]], [[premenstrual stress syndrome|PMS]] and [[Substance dependence|addiction]].<ref>S. Garton. [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170047b.htm Bailey, Harry Richard (1922-1985)]. ''Australian dictionary of national biography'' (online edition)</ref>

Twenty-six patients died at Chelmsford Private Hospital during the 1960s and 1970s, with only perfunctory investigation by authorities. After the failure of the agencies of medical and criminal investigation to tackle complaints about Chelmsford, a series of articles in the early 1980s in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and television coverage on [[60 Minutes]] exposed the abuses at the hospital including 24 deaths from the treatment.  This forced the authorities to take action, and a [[Chelmsford Royal Commission|Royal Commission]] was appointed.<ref>J O'Neill and Robert Haupt. The last victim of the 'beautiful hospital'. ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 2 August 1988</ref>  The [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] a psychiatric reform group established by the Church of Scientology was a leading advocate for victims and received documents from the hospital copied by a nurse "Rosa".<ref>Brian Bromberger and Janet Fife-Yeomans "Deep Sleep: Harry Bailey and the Scandal of Chelmsford" Simon  & Schuster 1991 page 111</ref>

In 1978 Sydney psychiatrist Brian Boettcher had convened a meeting of doctors working at Chelmsford and found there was little support for deep sleep therapy (Harry Bailey did not attend). However the treatment continued to be used into the following year.<ref>E. Wilson 2003 Psychiatric abuse at Chelmsford Private Hospital, New South Wales, 1960-1980s. In C. Coleborne and D.

In her book ''First Half'',<ref>"First Half" by Toni Lamond, page: 199.  Pan Books, Sydney, 1990  ISBN 0 330 27185 7.</ref> [[Toni Lamond]] described what it was like when she was admitted there in 1970.  She had an addiction to [[prescription drug]]s and a friend told her about Dr Bailey who duly became her psychiatrist.

:''I was given a semi private room.  On the way to it I saw several beds along the corridors with sleeping patients.  The patient in the other bed in my room was also asleep.  I thought nothing of it at the time.  Although it was mid morning, the stillness was eerie for a hospital that looked to be full to overflowing.  I was given a handful of pills to take and the next thing I remember was Dr Bailey standing by the bed asking how I felt.  I told him I'd had a good night's sleep.  He laughed and informed me it was ten days' later and what's more he had taken some weight off me.  I was checked out of the hospital and this time noticed the other patients were still asleep or being taken to the bathroom while out on their feet.''

The New South Wales government recently admitted that three people over the last three years had been kept continuously unconscious for 48 hours whilst undergoing ECT.<ref>[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod%5Cparlment%5Chanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LC20110906?open&refNavID=HA3_1 Full Day Hansard Transcript (Legislative Council, 6 September 2011, Proof)], p.35; [http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/ect-patients-under-anaesthetic-for-two-days-20110617-1g7ur.html ECT patients under anaesthetic for two days], Sydney Morning Herald, 18 June 2011.</ref>
