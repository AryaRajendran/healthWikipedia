'''Mark A. Talamini, MD''' is professor and M. J. Orloff Family chair of the department of surgery at [[UC San Diego Medical Center]], editor-in-chief of [[Surgical Endoscopy]], the official journal of the [[Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons]] (SAGES) and European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, and former president of SAGES.

Talamini specializes in gastrointestinal surgery, with a particular emphasis on the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease ([[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]]) and the use of minimally invasive technology to minimize pain and scarring. He is certified by the [[American Board of Surgery]] as well as the Critical Care Board.

Talamini is the author of Advanced Therapy in Minimally Invasive Surgery, an in-depth exploration of new and emerging surgical practices. In 2008, Talamini's surgical team gained worldwide attention for pioneering natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery ([[NOTES]]), the practice of removing diseased organs through natural body openings. Part of the [[UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery]], the team was the first in the United States to remove an appendix through the mouth.

In partnership with [[Jacobs School of Engineering]] and [[Calit2]], Talamini is pushing the limits of surgical technology by helping to develop a new surgical camera that boasts auto focus and optical zoom. Designed for [[NOTES]], optical zoom will give surgeons the ability to change the field of view and some peripheral vision. The first prototype is called Surgicam.

Prior to [[UC San Diego Medical Center]], Talamini was director of minimally invasive surgery at [[The Johns Hopkins Hospital]] from 1992 to 2004, where he pioneered new minimally invasive surgical techniques for abdominal diseases. Talamini was one of the first surgeons at Johns Hopkins to use robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques for general abdominal procedures such as gallbladder removal and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux

A highly respected surgeon, researcher, and teacher, Talamini is recognized as one of the leading authorities on [[laparoscopic]] and robotic-assisted surgery in the US. In his clinics and surgeries at [[UC San Diego Medical Center]] and [[Moores UCSD Cancer Center]], he specializes in gastrointestinal surgery, with a particular emphasis on the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].
