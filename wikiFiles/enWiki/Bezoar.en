A '''bezoar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|z|ɔər}}) is a mass found trapped in the [[gastrointestinal system]] (usually the [[stomach]]),<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000012475|bezoar}}</ref> though it can occur in other locations.<ref name="pmid19070299">{{cite journal |author=Bala M, Appelbaum L, Almogy G |title=Unexpected cause of large bowel obstruction: colonic bezoar |journal=Isr.

There are several varieties of bezoar, some of which have [[inorganic]] constituents and others [[organic compound|organic]].

==History==
Bezoars were sought because they were believed to have the power of a universal [[antidote]] against any [[poison]].  It was believed that a drinking glass which contained a bezoar would neutralize any poison poured into it.  The word "bezoar" comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''pād-zahr'' ({{lang|fa|پادزهر}}), which literally means "antidote".

The [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] Muslim physician [[Ibn Zuhr]] (d. 1161), known in the West as Avenzoar, is thought to have made the earliest description of bezoar stones as medicinal items.<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=Joseph P.|title=Encyclopedia of the Black Death|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1598842536|page=33}}</ref> 

In 1575, the surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] described an experiment to test the properties of the bezoar stone. At the time, the bezoar stone was deemed to be able to cure the effects of any poison, but Paré believed this was impossible. It happened that a cook at King's court was caught stealing fine silver cutlery and was sentenced to death by hanging. The cook agreed to be poisoned instead. Ambroise Paré then used the bezoar stone to no great avail, as the cook died in agony seven hours later.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ambroise Paré and His Times, 1510–1590 |author=Stephen Paget |authorlink=Stephen Paget|year=1897 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |url=http://books.google.com/?id=s2PsYxqqiSIC |pages=186–187}}</ref> Paré had proved that the bezoar stone could not cure all poisons as was commonly believed at the time. 

"Modern examinations of the properties of bezoars by Gustaf Arrhenius and Andrew A. Benson of the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] have shown that they could, when immersed in an arsenic-laced solution, remove the poison. The toxic compounds in arsenic are [[arsenate]] and [[Arsenic trioxide|arsenite]]. Each is acted upon differently, but effectively, by bezoar stones. Arsenate is removed by being exchanged for phosphate in the mineral brushite, a crystalline structure found in the stones. Arsenite is found to bond to sulfur compounds in the protein of degraded hair, which is a key component in bezoars."<ref>http://www.melfisher.org/bezoar.htm</ref>

A famous case in the [[common law]] of [[England]] (''[[Chandelor v Lopus]]'', 79 Eng Rep. 3, Cro. Jac. 4, [[Exchequer|Eng. Ct. Exch.]] 1603) announced the rule of ''[[caveat emptor]]'', "let the buyer beware", if the goods they purchased are not in fact genuine and effective. The case concerned a purchaser who sued for the return of the purchase price of an allegedly [[fraud]]ulent bezoar.  (How the [[plaintiff]] discovered the bezoar did not work is not discussed in the report.)

The ''[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]]'' notes that consumption of unripened [[persimmon]]s has been identified as causing epidemics of intestinal bezoars, and that up to 90% of bezoars that occur from eating too much of the fruit require surgery for removal.<ref>Merck Manual, Rahway, New Jersey, Sixteenth Edition, Gastrointestinal Disorders, Section 52, p. 780</ref>

==Types by content==
* '''Food boluses''' (or boli, singular, bolus) carry the archaic and positive meaning of bezoar, and are composed of loose aggregates of food items such as seeds, fruit pith, or pits, as well as other types of items such as [[shellac]], [[bubble gum]], soil, and concretions of some medications.
* '''Lactobezoar''' is a specific type of food bezoar comprising [[inspissated]] milk. It is most commonly seen in premature infants receiving formula foods.
* '''Pharmacobezoars''' (or medication bezoars) are mostly tablets or semiliquid masses of drugs, normally found following [[overdose]] of [[sustained-release]] medications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buckley NA, Dawson AH, Reith DA |title=Controlled release drugs in overdose.

* '''[[Phytobezoar]]s''' are composed of indigestible plant material (e.g., [[cellulose]]), and are frequently reported in patients with impaired digestion and decreased gastric motility.
* '''[[phytobezoar|Diospyrobezoar]]''' is type of phytobezoar formed from unripe [[persimmon]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kishan | first = Asn | last2 = Kadli | first2 = NK

Humans who frequently consume hair sometimes require these to be removed.  The [[Rapunzel syndrome]], a very rare and extreme case, may require surgery.

==Types by location==
*A bezoar in the [[esophagus]] is common in young children and in [[horses]].  In horses, it is known as [[Choke (horse)|choke]].
*A bezoar in the [[large intestine]] is known as a [[fecaloma|fecalith]].
*A bezoar in the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] is called a tracheobezoar.

===Uses of bezoars===
* Esophageal bezoars in the nasogastrically fed patients on mechanical ventilation and sedation have been reported to be due to precipitation of certain food types rich in casein, which get precipitated with gastric acid reflux to form esophageal bezoars.
* Ox bezoars (cow bezoars) are used in [[Chinese herbology]], where they are called ''[[niu-huang]]'' (牛黃) or ''[[calculus bovis]]''. These are gallstones ,or substitutes, from ox or cattle gall bladder bile. There are artificial calculus bovis used as substitutes. These are manufactured from cholic acid derived from bovine bile. <ref>Ingredients, '''AN KUNG NIU HUANG WAN''' (''Bezoar Chest Functioning Pills''), Peking Tung Jen Tang, Peking, China. 1980.</ref>  In some products, they claim to remove "toxins" from the body.  
*In alchemy, "animal bezoar" is the heart and lungs of the viper, pulverized together.<ref name="Cyclopaedia">{{Cite encyclopedia | last = Chambers | first = Ephraim | authorlink = Ephraim Chambers | title = Bezoar | encyclopedia = [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]] | volume = 1 | page = 98b | location = London | year = 1728}}</ref> Mineral bezoar is an [[emetic]] powder of [[antimony]], correct with [[spirit of nitre]], and softened by repeated lotions, which were said to carry off the purgative virtue of the antimony, and substitute a [[diaphoretic]] one.
