== Origin ==
The exact origin of syphilis is unknown.<ref name=Kent08>{{cite journal |author=Kent ME, Romanelli F |title=Reexamining syphilis: an update on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=226–36 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18212261 |doi=10.1345/aph.1K086 |url=}}</ref> Two primary theories have been proposed. It is widely agreed upon by historians and anthropologists that syphilis was present among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] before Europeans traveled to and from the [[New World]].<ref name=Orgin10/> However, whether strains of syphilis were present in the entire world for millennia, or if the disease was confined to the Americas in the pre-Columbian era, has been debated.<ref name=Orgin10/>

* The '''Columbian theory''' holds that syphilis was a [[New World]] disease brought back by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[Martin Alonso Pinzon]]. Columbus's voyages to the Americas occurred three years before the Naples syphilis outbreak of 1494.<ref name=Orgin10/> This theory is supported by genetic studies of venereal syphilis and related bacteria, which found a disease intermediate between [[yaws]] and syphilis in [[Guyana]], South America.<ref>{{cite news |author=Debora MacKenzie |title=Columbus blamed for spread of syphilis |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=15 January 2008 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13186-columbus-blamed-for-spread-of-syphilis-.html}}</ref><ref name="pmid18235852" />
* The '''[[pre-Columbian]] theory''' holds that syphilis was present in Europe before the discovery of the Americas by Europeans. Some scholars during the 18th and 19th centuries believed that the symptoms of syphilis in its [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary form]] were described by [[Hippocrates]] in [[Classical Greece]].<ref>{{citation |title=Introduction of Syphilis from the New World |author=Bollaert, WM |year=1864 |url=http://www.logoi.com/health/syphilis/syphilis_1.html |quote= }}</ref> Skeletons in pre-Columbus [[Pompeii]] and [[Metaponto]] in Italy with damage somewhat similar to that caused by congenital syphilis have also been found.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/101219/Timestwo/t2_01.html Pompeii skeletons reveal secrets of Roman family life</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Henneberg M, Henneberg RJ |year=1994 |chapter=Treponematosis in an Ancient Greek colony of Metaponto, Southern Italy 580-250 BCE |editor=O Dutour, G Palfi, J Berato, J-P Brun (eds) |title=The Origin of Syphilis in Europe, Before or After 1493? |publisher=Centre Archeologique du Var, Editions Errance |location=Toulon-Paris|pages=92–98}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Henneberg M, Henneberg RJ |year=2002 |chapter=Reconstructing Medical Knowledge in Ancient Pompeii from the Hard Evidence of Bones and Teeth |editor=J Renn, G Castagnetti (eds) |title=Homo Faber: Studies on Nature.

Owsley]], a [[physical anthropologist]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and other supporters of this idea, say that many medieval European cases of [[leprosy]], colloquially called ''lepra'', were actually cases of syphilis. Although folklore claimed that syphilis was unknown in Europe until the return of the diseased sailors of the Columbian voyages, Owsley says that "syphilis probably cannot be "blamed"—as it often is—on any geographical area or specific race. The evidence suggests that the disease existed in both hemispheres from prehistoric times. It is only coincidental with the Columbus expeditions that the syphilis previously thought of as "lepra" flared into virulence at the end of the 15th&nbsp;century."<ref name="OWSLEY">{{cite journal |author=Lobdell J, Owsley D|title=The origin of syphilis |journal=Journal of Sex Research |month=August |year=1974 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=76–79 |doi=10.1080/00224497409550828}} (via [[JSTOR]])</ref> Lobdell and Owsley wrote that a European writer who recorded an outbreak of "lepra" in 1303 was "clearly describing syphilis."<ref name="OWSLEY"/>

Historian [[Alfred Crosby]] suggests both theories are partly correct in a "combination theory". Crosby says that [[Treponema pallidum|the bacterium that causes syphilis]] belongs to the same phylogenetic family as the bacteria that cause [[yaws]] and several other diseases. Despite the tradition of assigning the homeland of yaws to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], Crosby notes that there is no unequivocal evidence of any related disease having been present in pre-Columbian Europe, Africa, or Asia. Crosby writes, "It is not impossible that the organisms causing ''[[treponema]]tosis '' arrived from America in the 1490s...and evolved into both venereal and non-venereal syphilis and yaws."<ref name="146 Crosby">{{vcite book |author=Crosby, Alfred W. |title=The Columbian exchange: biological and cultural consequences of 1492 |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= 146|isbn=0-275-98092-8 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=}}</ref> However, Crosby considers it more likely that a highly contagious ancestral species of the bacteria moved with early human ancestors across the land bridge of the [[Bering Straits]] many thousands of years ago without dying out in the original source population. He hypothesizes that "the differing ecological conditions produced different types of [[treponema]]tosis and, in time, closely related but different diseases."<ref name="146 Crosby" />  

However, in late 2011 the [[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]] published an appraisal by George Armelagos of [[Emory University]], Molly Zuckerman, and Kristin Harper of previous studies that the "skeletal data bolsters the case that syphilis did not exist in Europe before Columbus set sail."<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21613/abstract The origin and antiquity of syphilis revisited: An Appraisal of Old World pre-Columbian evidence for treponemal infection.

==European outbreak==
[[File:DürerSyphilis1496.jpg|thumb|A medical illustration attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1496) depicting a person with syphilis. Here, the disease is believed to have [[astrology|astrological]] causes.]]
The first well-recorded European outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1495 among French troops besieging [[Naples]], Italy.<ref name=Orgin10/> It may have been transmitted to the French via Spanish mercenaries serving King Charles of France in that siege.<ref name="OWSLEY"/> From this centre, the disease swept across Europe. As [[Jared Diamond]] describes it, "[W]hen syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its [[pustule]]s often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months." The disease then was much more lethal than it is today. Diamond concludes,"[B]y 1546, the disease had evolved into the disease with the symptoms so well known to us today."<ref name=Diamond1>{{cite book | author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton | pages=210 | isbn=84-8306-667-X}}</ref> The [[epidemiology]] of this first syphilis epidemic shows that the disease was either new or a mutated form of an earlier disease.

Researchers concluded that syphilis was carried from the New World to Europe after [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' voyages. Many of the crew members who served on this voyage later joined the army of [[Charles VIII of France|King Charles VIII]] in his invasion of Italy in 1495, resulting in the spreading of the disease across Europe and as many as five million deaths.<ref name="pmid18235852">{{cite journal| last1 = Harper | first1 = KN| last2 = Ocampo | first2 = PS| last3 = Steiner | first3 = BM| last4 = George | first4 = RW|last5 = Silverman | first5 = MS| last6 = Bolotin | first6 = S| last7 = Pillay | first7 = A| last8 = Saunders | first8 = NJ| last9 = Armelagos | first9 = GJ| editor1-last = Ko  |editor1-first = Albert| title = On the Origin of the Treponematoses: A Phylogenetic Approach| doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000148| journal = PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases

==Historical terms==
The name "syphilis" was coined by the [[Italians|Italian]] physician and poet [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] in his [[Epic poetry|epic]] noted poem, written in [[Latin]], titled ''Syphilis sive morbus gallicus'' ([[Latin]] for "Syphilis or The [[France|French]] Disease") in 1530.<ref name=Music08/> The protagonist of the poem is a [[shepherd]] named Syphilus (perhaps a variant spelling of Sipylus, a character in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''). Syphilus is presented as the first man to contract the disease, sent by the god [[Apollo]] as punishment for the defiance that Syphilus and his followers had shown him.<ref name=Music08/> From this character Fracastoro derived a new name for the disease, which he also used in his medical text ''De Contagionibus'' ("On Contagious Diseases").<ref>{{cite web | title = Syphilis | url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Syphilis&searchmode=none |publisher = Online Etymology Dictionary |year = 2001}}</ref>

Until that time, as Fracastoro notes,{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}} syphilis had been called the "French disease" in Italy, Poland and [[Germany]], and the "Italian disease" in France. In addition, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] called it the "Spanish disease", the [[Russians]] called it the "Polish disease", the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] called it the "Christian disease" or "Frank disease" (''frengi'') and the [[Tahiti]]ans called it the "[[United Kingdom|British]] disease". These "national" names were generally reflective of contemporary political spite between nations and frequently served as a sort of propaganda; the Dutch, for example, had a colonial rivalry with a Spanish, so referring to Syphilis as the 'Spanish' disease reinforced a politically useful perception that the Spanish were immoral or unworthy. The inherent xenophobia of the terms also stemmed from the disease's particular epidemiology, often being spread by foreign sailors and soldiers during their frequent sexual contact with local [[prostitution|prostitutes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

During the 16th&nbsp;century, it was called "great pox" in order to distinguish it from [[smallpox]]. In its early stages, the great pox produced a rash similar to smallpox (also known as [[variola]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, the name is misleading, as smallpox was a far more deadly disease.

==Historical treatments==
There were originally no effective treatments for syphilis. The Spanish priest [[Francisco Delicado]] wrote ''El modo de adoperare el legno de India'' (Rome, 1525) about the use of ''[[Guaiacum]]'' in the treatment of syphilis. He himself suffered from syphilis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Nicholas Culpeper]] recommended the use of [[heartsease]] (wild pansy), a herb with antimicrobial activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliomania.com/2/1/66/113/frameset.html|title=A complete herbal|author=Nicholas Culpeper}}{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}}</ref> Another common remedy was [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]: the use of which gave rise to the saying "A night in the arms of [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] leads to a lifetime on [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]]".<ref>{{cite news |author=Hanlon M |title=The magical properties of Mercury, the metal the EU wants to ban |date=7 June 2007 |publisher=The Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=460406&in_page_id=1770 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> It was administered in various fashions, including by mouth,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} by rubbing it on the skin,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and by injection.<ref name="pmc2261112">{{cite journal

Giorgio Sommariva of Verona is recorded to have used it for this purpose in 1496.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

As the disease became better understood, more effective treatments were found. An antimicrobial used for treating disease was the [[arsenic|organo-arsenical]] drug [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]], developed in 1908 by [[Sahachiro Hata]] in the laboratory of [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Paul Ehrlich]]. This group later discovered the related arsenical, [[Neosalvarsan]], which is less toxic. Unfortunately, these drugs were not 100% effective, especially in late disease, and were sometimes unpredictably toxic to patients.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It was observed that sometimes patients who developed high fevers were cured of syphilis. Thus, for a brief time [[malaria]] was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of [[pyrotherapy]]). This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with [[quinine]], which was available at that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Malaria as a treatment for syphilis was usually reserved for late disease, especially [[neurosyphilis]], and then followed by either Salvarsan or Neosalvarsan as adjuvant therapy. This discovery was championed by [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Raju T | title = Hot brains: manipulating body heat to save the brain | doi= 10.1542/peds.2005-1934 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = e320–1 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16452338|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/117/2/e320.full.pdf }}</ref> who won the 1927 [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]] for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of neurosyphilis.

==History of diagnosis==
In 1905, [[Fritz Schaudinn|Schaudinn]] and [[Erich Hoffmann|Hoffmann]] discovered ''Treponema pallidum'' in tissue of patients with syphilis.<ref name=Music08/> One year later, the first effective test for syphilis, the [[Wassermann test]], was developed. Although it had some false positive results, it was a major advance in the detection and prevention of syphilis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} By allowing testing before the acute symptoms of the disease had developed, this test allowed the prevention of transmission of syphilis to others, even though it did not provide a cure for those infected. In the 1930s the Hinton test, developed by [[William Augustus Hinton]], and based on [[flocculation]], was shown to have fewer [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] reactions than the Wassermann test.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Both of these early tests have been superseded by newer analytical methods.

While working at the [[Rockefeller University]] (then called the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research) in 1913, [[Hideyo Noguchi]], a [[Japan]]ese scientist, demonstrated the presence of the spirochete ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, associating ''Treponema pallidum'' with neurosyphilis.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Noguchi, Hideyo |url=http://www.bartleby.net/65/no/NoguchiH.html |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=Sixth}}{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> Prior to Noguchi's discovery, syphilis had been a burden to humanity in many lands. Without its cause being understood, it was sometimes misdiagnosed and often misattributed to damage by political enemies. It is called "the great pretender" for its variety of symptoms. [[Felix Milgrom]] developed a test for syphilis. The [[Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize]], was named to honor the man who identified the agent in association with the late form of the infectious disease.<ref>Cabinet Office, Japan: [http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/english/keii/gaiyo.html Noguchi Prize]</ref>

== Notable cases ==
{{Main|Notable cases of syphilis}}
Mental illness caused by late-stage syphilis was once a common form of [[dementia]]. This was known as the [[general paresis of the insane]]. 
Many famous historical figures, including [[Charles VIII of France]], [[Hernán Cortés]] of Spain, [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], and [[Ivan the Terrible]], are alleged to have had syphilis or other sexually transmitted infections. Sometimes these allegations were false and formed part of a political [[whispering campaign]]. In other instances, [[retrospective diagnoses]] of suspected cases have been made in modern times.
