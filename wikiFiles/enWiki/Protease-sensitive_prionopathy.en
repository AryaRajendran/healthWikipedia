'''Protease-sensitive prionopathy''' ('''PSPr''') is a [[neurodegenerative disorder]] caused by an abnormal [[isoform]] of the [[prion]] [[protein]]. Contrary to the prions in [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CJD), the prions in this condition are sensitive to [[protease]] activity.

PSPr was first described in an abstract for a conference on prions in 2006, and this study was published in a 2008 report on 11 cases. The study was conducted by Gambetti P. and coworkers from the United States National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center.<ref name="pmid18571782">{{cite journal |author=Gambetti P, Dong Z, Yuan J, ''et al.'' |title=A novel human disease with abnormal prion protein sensitive to protease |journal=Ann.

Symptoms of PSPr are behavioral and psychiatric abnormalities with progressive decline in cognitive and motor functions (including [[dementia]], [[ataxia]], [[parkinsonism]], [[psychosis]], [[aphasia]] and [[mood disorder]]s). This is similar to what occurs in other [[spongiform encephalopathy|spongiform encephalopathies]], and the condition can be mistaken for [[Alzheimer's dementia]]. 

Contrary to what is the case in CJD, there were no cases with a positive [[14-3-3 protein]] test in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], no periodic complexes on [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and no pathognomonic changes on diffusion-weighted [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] images. The mean age of onset in the original 11 patients was 62 years. Patients progressed to death in 20 months on average. PSPr accounted for three percent of prion disease cases evaluated by the U.S. National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (prion diseases occur in the order of magnitude of 1 case per million people).<ref name="pmid18570344">{{cite journal |author=Will R, Head M |title=A new prionopathy |journal=Ann.

The diagnosis can be made on [[pathology|pathological examination]]. There are unique microscopic and [[immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] features, and the prions cannot be digested using proteases. Because 8 out of 10 patients had a positive family history of dementia in the original study, a genetic cause was suspected. Although all cases were [[homozygous]] for [[valine]] at [[codon]] 129 of the [[PrP]] gene, no mutations were detected.

How these protease-resistant prions lead to neurological disease remains incompletely understood. For instance, protein-resistant prions have been found in normal human brains.<ref name="pmid16987816">{{cite journal |author=Yuan J, Xiao X, McGeehan J, ''et al.'' |title=Insoluble aggregates and protease-resistant conformers of prion protein in uninfected human brains |journal=J.
