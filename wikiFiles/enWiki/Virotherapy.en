'''Virotherapy''' is a treatment using [[biotechnology]] to convert [[virus]]es into therapeutic agents by reprogramming viruses to treat diseases. There are three main branches of virotherapy: anti-cancer [[oncolytic virus]]es, [[viral vector]]s for [[gene therapy]] and viral [[immunotherapy]].

==Oncolytic virotherapy==

Oncolytic virotherapy is not a new idea – as early as the mid 1950s doctors were noticing that cancer patients who suffered a non-related viral infection, or who had been vaccinated recently, showed signs of improvement;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=E|coauthors=Russell, SJ|title=History of oncolytic viruses: genesis to genetic engineering.|journal=Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy|date=2007 Apr|volume=15|issue=4|pages=651–9|pmid=17299401|url=http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v15/n4/full/6300108a.html}}</ref> this has been largely attributed to the production of [[interferon]] and tumour [[necrosis]] factors in response to viral infection, but [[oncolytic virus]]es are being designed that selectively target and [[lysis|lyse]] only cancerous cells.

In the 1940s and 1950s, studies were conducted in animal models to evaluate the use of viruses in the treatment of [[tumour]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=AE|title=The destructive effect of the virus of Russian Far East encephalitis on the transplantable mouse sarcoma 180.|journal=Cancer|date=1949 May|volume=2|issue=3|pages=525–34|pmid=18131412}}</ref>  In the 1940s-50s some of the earliest human [[clinical trial]]s with oncolytic viruses were started.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical virotherapy: four historically significant clinical trials|url=http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v15/n4/fig_tab/6300108t1.html#figure-title}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Huebner|first=RJ|coauthors=Rowe, WP; Schatten, WE; Smith, RR; Thomas, LB|title=Studies on the use of viruses in the treatment of carcinoma of the cervix.|journal=Cancer|date=1956 Nov-Dec|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1211–8|pmid=13383455|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13383455?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg}}</ref> However, for several years research in this field was delayed due to the inadequate technology available. Research has now started to proceed more quickly in finding ways to use viruses therapeutically.

As well as the direct anti-cancer effect, oncolytic viruses are also capable of inducing an anti-tumour immune response.

==Viral gene therapy==

Viral gene therapy most frequently uses non-replicating viruses to deliver therapeutic genes to cells with genetic malfunctions. Early efforts while technically successful, faced considerable delays due to safety issues as the uncontrolled delivery of a gene into a host genome has the potential to disrupt tumour suppressing genes and induce cancer, and did so in two cases. Immune responses to viral therapies also pose a barrier to successful treatment, for this reason [[Ocular|eye]] therapy for genetic blindness is attractive as the eye is an [[immune privilege]]d site, preventing an immune response.

An alternative form of viral gene therapy is to deliver a gene which may be helpful in preventing disease that would not normally be expressed in the natural disease condition. For example the growth of new blood vessels in cancer, known as [[angiogenesis]], enables tumours to grow larger. However, a virus introducing anti-angiogenic factors to the tumour may be able to slow or halt growth.

==Viral immunotherapy==

Viral immunotherapy uses viruses to introduce specific [[antigen]]s to the patient's immune system. Unlike traditional [[vaccine]]s, in which attenuated or killed virus/bacteria is used to generate an immune response, viral immunotherapy uses genetically engineered viruses to present a specific antigen to the immune system. That antigen could be from any species of virus/bactera or even human disease antigens, for example cancer antigens.

==Specific projects and products==

===Oncolytic viruses===
{{Main|Oncolytic virus}}
The immune modulating virotherapy known as [[RIGVIR]] developed at the Institute of Microbiology in [[Latvia]] is the first virotherapy to pass all stages of clinical development and was approved in 2009,<ref>{{cite web|title=Register of Human Medicines|url=http://www.zva.gov.lv/index.php?id=375&top=334&ON=rigvir|publisher=State Agency of Medicines of Latvia|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref>  although not on the basis of controlled clinical trials. Rather it was approved on the basis of accumulated anecdotal clinical experience, and as a result is only available in Latvia.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

In 2004, researchers from [[University of Texas]] genetically programmed a type of [[common cold]] virus Adenovirus Delta-24-RGD to attack [[glioblastoma multiforme]]. Later other researchers <ref>Witlox AM, Van Beusechem VW, Molenaar B, Bras H, Schaap GR, Alemany R, Curiel DT, Pinedo HM, Wuisman PI, Gerritsen WR., Conditionally replicative adenovirus with tropism expanded towards integrins inhibits osteosarcoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jan 1;10(1 Pt 1):61-7</ref> have tried tests on mice where 9 out of 10 mice have shown degeneration of tumours and prolonged survival. A drug grade virus was approved for clinical trials on humans in 2009.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT00805376?show_desc=Y#desc Clinical Trial for Delta-24-RGD for Recurrent Malignant Gliomas]</ref>

In 2006 researchers from the [[Hebrew University]] succeeded in isolating a variant of the [[Newcastle disease]] Virus (NDV-HUJ), which usually affects birds, in order to specifically target cancer cells.<ref>[http://www.isracast.com/tech_news/260106_tech.aspx Isracast news article on virotherapy] March 2006</ref> The researchers tested the new virotherapy on patients with glioblastoma multiforme and achieved promising results for the first time.

Vaccinia virus, a virus credited for the eradication of smallpox, is being developed as an oncolytic virus, e.g. GL-ONC1 and [[JX-594]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genelux.com |title=Welcome to Genelux - intro |publisher=Genelux.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> Promising research results <ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17942938|year=2007|last1=Zhang|first1=Q|last2=Yu|first2=YA|last3=Wang|first3=E|last4=Chen|first4=N|last5=Danner|first5=RL|last6=Munson|first6=PJ|last7=Marincola|first7=FM|last8=Szalay|first8=AA|title=Eradication of solid human breast tumors in nude mice with an intravenously injected light-emitting oncolytic vaccinia virus|volume=67|issue=20|pages=10038–46|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0146|journal=Cancer Research}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18754710|year=2008|last1=Kelly|first1=KJ|last2=Woo|first2=Y|last3=Brader|first3=P|last4=Yu|first4=Z|last5=Riedl|first5=C|last6=Lin|first6=SF|last7=Chen|first7=N|last8=Yu|first8=YA|last9=Rusch|first9=VW|title=Novel oncolytic agent GLV-1h68 is effective against malignant pleural mesothelioma|volume=19|issue=8|pages=774–82|doi=10.1089/hum.2008.036|pmc=2940611|journal=Human gene therapy}}</ref> warrant its clinical development in human patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00794131?term=gl-ONC1&rank=1 |title=Safety Study of GL-ONC1, an Oncolytic Virus, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors |publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref>

The experimental virotherapy that has progressed the farthest in clinical trials (as of 2013) is [[Talimogene laherparepvec]].<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01161498 Study of Safety and Efficacy of OncoVEXGM-CSF With Cisplatin for Treatment of Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer]</ref> It is based on an engineered version of [[herpes simplex virus]] which has also been engineered to express GM-CSF. This virus is being developed by Amgen who reported that a pivotal phase 3 study in melanoma had met its primary endpoint (durable response rate) with a very high degree of significance in March 2013, the first positive phase 3 study with an oncolytic virus in the western world.

===Viral gene therapy===
[[ProSavin]] is one of a number of therapies in the [[Lentivector]] platform under development by [[Oxford BioMedica]]. It delivers to the brain the genes for three enzymes important in the production of [[dopamine]], a deficiency of which causes [[Parkinson's disease]].

[[TNFerade]] (a non replicating TNF gene therapy virus) failed a phase III trial for [[pancreatic cancer]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://oncolyticvirus.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/why-genvec%E2%80%99s-tnferade-adenovector-did-not-work-in-the-phase-iii-pancreatic-cancer-trial/ |title=Why GenVec’s TNFerade adenovector did not work in the Phase III pancreatic cancer trial? |date=14 April 2010 }}</ref>

===Viral immunotherapy===

[[Trovax]] is an immunotherapy that uses a pox-virus bearing the tumour antigen [[5T4]], to induce an immune response against a variety of cancer types. The therapy is in development by [[Oxford BioMedica]] and is in a Phase II trial.
