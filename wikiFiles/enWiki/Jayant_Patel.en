'''Jayant Mukundray Patel''' (born 10 April 1950) is an Indian [[surgery|surgeon]] who is at the centre of a 2005 [[scandal]] in which he was accused of gross incompetence while working at [[Bundaberg Base Hospital]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].  In June 2010, Patel was convicted of 3 counts of [[manslaughter]] and one case of [[grievous bodily harm]], and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. In August 2012, all convictions were quashed by the full bench of the [[High Court of Australia]] and a retrial was ordered due to 'highly emotive and prejudicial evidence that was irrelevant to the case' led before the jury.

==Early life and education==
Patel was born in [[Jamnagar]] in [[Gujarat, India]]. Initially, he studied surgery at the [[M.P. Shah Medical College]] at the [[Saurashtra University]], obtaining a [[master's degree]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He then moved to the [[United States]] where he received further surgical training at the [[University of Rochester School of Medicine]] as a surgical intern and a resident in surgery.

==Career==

===Buffalo, New York===
In 1984 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], health officials cited Patel for failing to examine patients before surgery.<ref name="aotse">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2006/11/21/australia-doctor.html |title=Australian officials to seek criminal charges against 'Dr. E. Coli' |accessdate=20 March 2013 |date=21 November 2006 |work=CBC News |publisher=CBC }}</ref> He was fined [[United States dollar|US$]]5,000 and was placed on three years' clinical probation. In April 2001, [[New York State]] health officials withdrew Patel's license.

===Portland, Oregon===
In 1989, Patel moved to the [[Kaiser Permanente]] Hospital in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Medical staff allege he performed surgery when not rostered to work, operated on other surgeon's patients, operated unnecessarily and caused serious injury and death. In 1998, Kaiser Permanente restricted Patel's practice. He was instructed not to operate on the [[liver]] or [[pancreas]] and to seek second opinions before performing other surgeries. In September 2000, after reviewing four cases involving the deaths of three patients, the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners made Patel's restriction statewide.<ref>{{cite web|title=JAYANT M. PATEL, MD Summary of Known Disciplinary Record |url=http://www.oregon.gov/OMB/PDFforms/Patel.pdf|publisher=Oregon Board of Medical Examiners|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>

===Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia===
In 2003, Patel moved to the position of Director of Surgery at the [[Bundaberg Base Hospital]] where he was employed by [[Queensland Health]] (the state government department of health in Queensland) under an "area of need" program where overseas trained doctors are employed in predominantly regional understaffed areas. This was undertaken without [[due diligence]] regarding his qualifications and experience. He was appointed despite having no specialist surgical qualifications.<ref name="ihcs">{{cite book |title=Improving Health Care Safety and Quality: Reluctant Regulators |last=Healy |first=Judith |year=2011 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |isbn=0754676447 |pages=34â€“35 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MIPURkuGhaMC |accessdate=26 June 2012 }}</ref>

==Practice in Bundaberg==
Inadequacies in Patel's practice were identified. His surgery was described as "antiquated" and "sloppy". Nurses claimed that they hid their patients from him when they knew that he was in the hospital. He showed poor regard for hygiene. He attracted the nickname "Dr. Death". It is alleged he altered medical records in order to hide his inadequacies.<ref>{{cite web

===Numbers affected===
Patel is linked to at least 87 deaths amongst the 1,202 patients he treated between 2003 and early 2005. 30 patients died while under his care in Bundaberg.<ref name="ihcs"/>

===Concerns made public===
On 22 March 2005, [[Stuart Copeland]], the Queensland [[Shadow Minister]] for Health, raised the issue of Patel's clinical practice during "Question Time" in the [[Parliament of Queensland|Queensland Parliament]]. Copeland had been alerted to Patel's inadequacies by [[Toni Hoffman]], a nurse at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. Two days later, [[Rob Messenger]], the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Electoral district of Burnett|Burnett]] also raised the matter in a speech to the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|Legislative Assembly]]. He called for Patel's suspension.

[[Hedley Thomas]], a journalist at ''The Courier-Mail'', who won a [[Walkley Award]] for his part in uncovering Patel's past,<ref>{{Cite document

===Patel leaves===
Patel departed Australia for Portland, Oregon using a business-class air fare paid for by [[Queensland Health]]. His passport had not been withheld.<ref>{{cite news

In 2007, he was filmed in Oregon by the [[Nine Network]]'s current affairs program, ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' in an investigation by reporter Paul Barry and producer Stephen Rice.

===Extradition to Australia===

On 22 November 2006, a magistrate issued a warrant for Patel's arrest and extradition to Australia.<ref>Tuck Thompson & Renee Viellaris (19 July 2008).

[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC News]]. 21 July 2008.</ref>

==Consequences==

===Political===
The scandal caused political problems for Queensland's [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] government, led by [[Peter Beattie]]. The state health minister, [[Gordon Nuttall]] (who was later convicted of corruption and perjury in unrelated matters) resigned from his cabinet position.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Qld-health-minister-Nuttall-quits/2005/07/22/1121539132175.html |title=Qld health minister Nuttall resigns |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=22 July 2005 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>

===Patients in Bundaberg===
Some of those treated by Patel threatened to take the Queensland Government to court for not acting on his practice deficiencies in a timely manner. However, prior to the Patel matter, state law had been changed to limit compensation in cases of medical negligence. This meant any payment to individual patients would be negligible. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Queensland Health did arrange corrective treatment or surgery for those injured by Patel. It is said that over one hundred patients have undergone corrective procedures. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Doctor registration===
The Medical Board of Queensland was generally criticised for their registration of Patel but members of the board continued unaffected by the matter. Changes were, however, made to the process of doctor registration in Queensland and later the process was handed over to a national body. From 1 July 2010, registration and regulation responsibilities formerly held by state medical boards were transferred to The Australian Medical Board supported by the newly-formed Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.

==Morris Inquiry==
In response to public discontent over Patel's performance at Bundaberg Base Hospital, the Beattie Government convened the "Bundaberg Hospital Commission of Inquiry". The Inquiry held similar judicial powers to a [[Royal Commission]], and commenced hearings in Brisbane on 23 May 2005. It was led by [[Anthony Morris QC|Anthony Morris]], a [[Queen's Counsel]].

On 10 June, Morris released an interim report that was tabled on the same day in State Parliament by Premier Beattie. The report recommended, among other things, that Dr Patel be charged with [[murder]] or [[manslaughter]] in respect to one patient, with causing "a [[negligence|negligent]] act causing harm" to another patient, that he also be charged with [[fraud]] in relation to his registration at the Medical Board of Queensland to practice medicine and that [[extradition]] proceedings should begin. It also recommended changes to the ''Medical Practitioners Registration Act 2001''.

The Morris Inquiry began hearings in Bundaberg on 20 June. Nurses, local Queensland Health administrators and former patients of Dr Patel were all expected to give evidence. Public hearings in Bundaberg concluded on 14 July. The Inquiry resumed public hearings in Brisbane on 25 July and also sat in [[Townsville]] from 2 August to 4 August. Evidence was heard in Townsville about an alleged case of medical fraud in which a [[Russia]]n with forged medical qualifications pretended to be a [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] and practiced for some time at Townsville Hospital.

During the course of the Morris Inquiry, two senior Queensland Health bureaucrats in the Bundaberg region, Darren Keating and Peter Leck, filed an application in the [[Supreme Court of Queensland]] calling for the inquiry to be shut down, alleging that Morris had shown apprehended bias against them. On 1 September, Justice Martin Moynihan of the [[Supreme Court of Queensland|Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the applicants, finding that the Commission of Inquiry was contaminated with ostensible bias against Keating and Leck, and that evidence gathered from other witnesses was entangled with the evidence given by Keating and Leck [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/qld/QSC/2005/243.html?query=].

== Davies Inquiry ==
The new inquiry began on 8 September 2005 and was headed by former Supreme Court of Queensland judge Justice [[Geoffrey Davies]] QC. This inquiry, formally titled the ''[[Davies Commission|Queensland Public Hospitals Commission of Inquiry]]'', was widely known as the Davies Inquiry.

The report of the Davies Inquiry was handed down on 30 November 2005. It recommended that charges of manslaughter and other criminal offenses be prosecuted against Patel.<ref name="ihcs"/> The report also apportioned much of the blame to two former Health Ministers, [[Gordon Nuttall]] and [[Wendy Edmond]], as well as senior Queensland Health bureaucrats for allowing the existence of an organizational culture of secrecy and ostracizing of [[whistleblower]]s that allowed Patel's misdeeds to go unpunished for two years.

An independent surgeon, Peter Woodruff, who was asked by Justice Davies to examine Patel's work believes that Patel negligently caused 13 deaths, and possibly up to 17.

==Other inquiries==
The [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] commissioned two other inquiries in addition to the Morris and Davies Inquiries. These inquiries possessed few judicial powers or ability to summon witnesses.

The [[Forster Inquiry]], headed by [[Peter Forster (Australian)|Peter Forster]], concentrated on the administrative structure of the Queensland Health bureaucracy, and how administrative procedures could be improved to ensure that similar events to those at Bundaberg Base Hospital would not occur again.

The other inquiry was an internal audit of Dr Patel's clinical and surgical practices by Queensland Health. On 30 June 2005, ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' newspaper published details of this audit before it was due for public release. The newspaper reported that there were seven patient deaths that were likely to have been caused by Patel and seven more that warrant further investigation. There has been some criticism that this audit relied too heavily on patient notes written by Patel himself, or by other Bundaberg Base Hospital staff who could have been interested in covering up Dr Patel's poor standards or minimising the hospital's liability for patient trauma and death.

The State of Oregon Medical Board is also investigating Patel a second time, this time for stating that he had retired, whilst working full-time as chief of surgery at Bundaberg Base Hospital, as well as lying to Kaiser Permanente about his previous disciplinary actions in New York state. Patel appeared before the state board in September 2005, but declined to answer questions, owing to possible criminal charges in Australia. On 6 October 2005, the Board voted unanimously to issue a formal complaint against Patel. Disciplinary action against the doctor can include a fine of up to US$ 5,000 and revocation of his medical license.

==Cases==
The Davies Inquiry found that he had caused 13 deaths, and perhaps up to 17.<ref name="ihcs"/>

In response, the Magistrate ordered Patel, who lives in a $900,000 house, to fill out a financial affidavit before an upcoming detention hearing. Following his arrest, [[Toni Hoffman]], the nurse who took her complaints about Patel to a member of the [[Parliament of Australia]], said that "I am relieved he's been arrested, but there's still a lot to go." Patel denied the "allegations out of Australia." The extradition proceeding against Patel began April 2008.<ref>{{cite web

===Trial===

Patel appealed his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal, and the [[prosecutor|prosecution]] also appealed sentence. Both appeals were dismissed.

====Appeal to High Court====
Patel then appealed the Court of Appeal's decision to the [[High Court of Australia]], and was granted special leave to appeal.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2012/29.html#fn90|title=Patel v The Queen [2012] HCA 29 (24 August 2012) |author= [[High Court of Australia]]| Library date=24 August 2012|publisher=Austlii |date=}}</ref> 
On 24 August 2012, the High Court unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed Patel's convictions on the ground that prejudicial evidence had likely influenced the jury.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/patel/story-e6frg6n6-1226457333848|title=Jayant Patel walks free after High Court quashes manslaughter convictions |author=[[Jared Owens]]| Library date=24 August 2012|publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=}}</ref> The Court also ordered a retrial.

==Aftermath==
In a television documentary on the case aired by the CNN in November 2010 as part of its "Worldâ€™s Untold Stories" series and entitled "They Called Him â€˜Dr. Deathâ€™" several of Patelâ€™s medical co-workers in Australia testified to having repeatedly blown a whistle on him only to be ignored by medical superiors and other authorities. Questions were also raised about the lack of due diligence by those involved in his appointment.<ref>{{cite news | title = They Called Him 'Dr Death' | date = 2 November 2010 | work = CNN | url = http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/international/2010/11/02/wus.dr.death.bk.a.cnn | accessdate = 18 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = The Making of a Bad Surgeon | date = 2 November 2010 | work = CNN | url = http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/international/2010/11/02/wus.dr.death.bk.b.cnn | accessdate = 18 November 2010 }}</ref><ref name="part3"/>
