'''Krebiozen''' (aka '''Carcalon''', '''substance X''', or '''drug X''') is an [[alternative cancer treatment]]. While the substance has been marketed as a cure for cancer, Krebiozen is not known to possess any therapeutic value. Attempts to analyze its composition have shown that Krebiozen consists only of the [[amino acid]] [[creatine]] dissolved in [[mineral oil]], and some samples sold as Krebiozen consist solely of mineral oil with no other discernible ingredients.<ref name="Time1"/><ref name="Quackwatch"/>

== History and evaluation ==
Krebiozen was initially promoted by Stevan Durovic, a [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] physician who claimed that the substance came from horse serum inoculated with ''[[Actinomyces bovis]]''.<ref name="Time1"/> Durovic claimed that Krebiozen had been useful in the treatment of cancer, mainly in cats and dogs. His claims were backed by [[Andrew Conway Ivy]], a prominent physiologist, and by several politicians including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Paul Douglas]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Illinois|IL]]).<ref name="Time1"/> Ivy became convinced that Krebiozen possessed anti-cancer properties,<ref name=BCCA>{{cite web | url = http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/Krebiozen.htm |title = Krebiozen | publisher = British Columbia Cancer Agency | date = February 2000 | accessdate = 2008-10-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080416120729/http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/Krebiozen.htm | archivedate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> administered the substance to himself and colleagues, then to a dog, and eventually started testing Krebiozen on patients.<ref name=Quackwatch>{{cite web | url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/krebiozen.html | title = The Krebiozen Story |publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | last = Holland | first = James | date = 1966-10-07 | accessdate= 2008-10-09}}</ref>

Ivy called a [[press conference]] in 1951 at which he announced to an audience of journalists, politicians, doctors and potential investors that Krebiozen was a success. At the press conference, Ivy claimed that of 22 treated patients, 14 were alive and none had died of cancer. However, in reality 10 of the treated patients had died&mdash;all of cancer&mdash;at the time of the press conference.<ref name=Quackwatch/> Shortly afterward, the Krebiozen Research Foundation was established by the Durovic brothers, with Ivy as president.

Intrigued by Ivy's announcement, 10 hospitals and cancer research centers followed up on the trial and attempted to [[reproducibility|reproduce]] Ivy's claimed results. However, all of these independent researchers observed no effect of Krebiozen on cancer. A compilation of these institutions' negative data was reported in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1951.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=STATUS report on &quot;krebiozen&quot; |journal=J Am Med Assoc |volume=147 |issue=9 |pages=864&ndash;73 |year=1951 |month=October |pmid=14873580 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Krebiozen's backers responded by [[conspiracy theory|alleging a conspiracy]] against the drug.<ref name=Quackwatch/> In 1959, Ivy began producing his own version of the drug under the name "Carcalon".<ref name=ACS/> 

On October 28, 1964, the Durovics, Ivy and the Krebiozen Research Foundation were indicted for introducing mislabeled drugs into interstate commerce in violation of the [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]]. After a 9-month trial, the case ended with a [[hung jury]] and they were acquitted.<ref name=Quackwatch/><ref name="Time2">{{cite news | publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842474,00.html | title = The Krebiozen Verdict | date = 1966-11-02 | accessdate = 2008-10-09}}</ref> Soon afterwards, Durovic was indicted for tax evasion and fled the United States.<ref name="ACS"/>

== Composition ==
In order to evaluate Durovic's and Ivy's claims, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) requested samples of Krebiozen. These were provided on two occasions to the NCI and one occasion to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Durovic proposed to charge the NCI $170,000 per gram of Krebiozen, although ultimately the samples were provided free of charge. However, the provided samples proved to consist only of [[creatine monohydrate]], a simple [[amino acid]], sometimes dissolved in [[mineral oil]].<ref name=Quackwatch/><ref name=BCCA/><ref name=ACS>{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Krebiozen.asp?sitearea=ETO |title = Krebiozen | publisher = [[American Cancer Society]] | date = 2007-07-20| accessdate = 2008-10-09}}</ref><ref name=Time1>{{cite news| publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896964,00.html |title = Krebiozen Analyzed | date = 1963-09-13 | accessdate = 2008-10-09}}</ref> When the FDA went back to test previously acquired samples of Krebiozen, they found that many lacked even creatine, and consisted solely of mineral oil with no discernible [[active ingredient]]s.<ref name="Quackwatch"/>
