'''Cheiralgia paresthetica''' is a [[neuropathy]] of the [[hand]] generally caused by [[compression neuropathy|compression]] or [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to the superficial branch of the [[radial nerve]].<ref name="CSE.cp">

}}</ref> Symptoms include numbness, tingling, burning or pain. Since the nerve branch is sensory there is no motor impairment.<ref name="TS" /> It may be distinguished from [[de Quervain syndrome]] because it is not dependent on motion of the hand or fingers.<ref name="dang" />

The most common cause is thought to be constriction of the wrist, as with a bracelet or watchband (hence reference to "wristwatch neuropathy"). It is especially associated with the use of [[handcuffs]] and is therefore commonly referred to as '''handcuff neuropathy'''. Other injuries or surgery in the wrist area can also lead to symptoms, including surgery for other syndromes such as de Quervain's.<ref>

Symptoms commonly resolve on their own within several months when the constriction is removed; [[NSAID]]s are commonly prescribed.<ref name="dang">

This neuropathy was first identified by [[Robert Wartenberg]] in a 1932 paper.<ref>
