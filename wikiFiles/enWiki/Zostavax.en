'''Zostavax''' is a [[attenuated vaccine|live vaccine]] developed by [[Merck & Co.]] that has been shown to reduce the incidence of [[herpes zoster|herpes zoster (known as shingles)]] by 51.3% in a study of 38,000 adults aged 60 and older who received the vaccine. The vaccine also reduced by 66.5% the number of cases of [[postherpetic neuralgia]] and reduced the severity and duration of pain and discomfort associated with shingles, by 61.1%.<ref> Zostavax is, essentially, a larger-than-normal dose of Varivax, the [[varicella vaccine|chickenpox vaccine]], as both shingles (prevented by Zostavax) and chickenpox (prevented by Varivax, even prevented by Zostavax as well) are caused by the same virus, [[Varicella Zoster Virus]] (VZV).
