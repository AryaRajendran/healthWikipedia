Mammalian target of rapamycin ([[mTOR]]) is a [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|serine/threonine kinase]], which belongs to [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase|phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase]] (PI3K) related kinases (PIKKs) family. It regulates cellular metabolism, growth, and proliferation, and therefore is a target for the development of a number of '''mTOR inhibitors'''.
It effects downstream pathway and forms two complexes, [[Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC1|mTORC1]] and [[Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC2|mTORC2]]. The most established mTOR inhibitors are so-called '''rapalogs''' (rapamycin and its analogs), which have shown tumor responses in clinical trials against various tumor types.<ref name=populo />

==History==
The discovery of mTOR was made a few decades ago while investigating the [[mechanism of action]] of its [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]], [[rapamycin]].<ref name=Strimpakos>{{cite journal|last=Strimpakos|first=Alex S.|coauthors=Karapanagiotou, Eleni M.; Saif, M.

Shortly after its discovery, [[immunosuppressive drug|immuosuppressive]] properties were detected, which later led to the establishment of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant. In the 1980s, rapamycin was also found to have anticancer activity although the exact mechanism of action remained unknown until many years later.<ref name=Strimpakos /><ref name=Faivre /><ref name=Vignot2005 />

In the 1990s there was a dramatic change in this field due to studies on the mechanism of action of rapamycin and the identification of the drug target.<ref name=Tsang /> It was found that rapamycin inhibited [[cell growth|cellular proliferation]] and [[Cell cycle|cell cycle progression]]. Research on mTOR inhibition has been a growing branch in science and has promising results.<ref name=Zaytseva />

In general, [[protein kinase]]s are classified in two major categories based on their substrate specificity, [[Tyrosine kinase|protein tyrosine kinases]] and [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|protein serine/threonine kinases]]. [[Dual-specificity kinase]]s are subclass of the tyrosine kinases.<ref name=Lempiainen2009>{{cite journal|last=Lempiäinen|first=Harri|coauthors=Halazonetis, Thanos D|title=Emerging common themes in regulation of PIKKs and PI3Ks|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=24 September 2009|volume=28|issue=20|pages=3067–3073|doi=10.1038/emboj.2009.281|pmid=19779456|pmc=2752028}}</ref>

mTOR is a kinase within the family of [[Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase|phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-related kinases (PIKKs)]],<ref name=Lovejoy2009 /> which is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, with a sequence similarity to the family of lipid kinases, [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3Ks]].<ref name="Lempiainen2009"/> These kinases have different biological functions,<ref name=Lempiainen2009 /> but are all large proteins with common domain structure.<ref name=Lovejoy2009>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Courtney A.|coauthors=Cortez, David|title=Common mechanisms of PIKK regulation|journal=DNA Repair|date=2 September 2009|volume=8|issue=9|pages=1004–1008|doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2009.04.006}}</ref>
[[File:Domain structure of mTOR.png|thumb|400px|right|The four domains of mTOR at the protein level]]
PIKKs have four domains at the protein level, which distinguish them from other protein kinases. From the [[N-terminus]] to the [[C-terminus]], these domains are named FRAP-ATM-TRAAP (FAT), [[Protein kinase domain|the kinase domain]] (KD), the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD), and the FAT-C-terminal (FATC).<ref name=Lempiainen2009 /> The FAT domain, consisting of four [[Alpha helix|α-helices]], is N-terminal to KD, but that part is referred to as the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain, which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex.<ref name=Lempiainen2009 /> The FAT domain consists of repeats, referred to as [[HEAT repeat domain|HEAT]] ([[Huntingtin]], [[Elongation factor|Elongation factor 3]], A subunit of [[Protein phosphatase 2|protein phosphatase 2A]] and TOR1).<ref name=Lovejoy2009 /> Specific protein activators regulate the PIKK kinases but binding of them to the kinase complex causes a conformational change that increases substrate access to the kinase domain.<ref name=Lovejoy2009 />

==mTOR signaling pathway==
It appears that [[growth factors]], [[amino acids]], [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and [[oxygen]] levels regulate mTOR signaling. Several [[Cell signaling|downstream pathways]] that regulate [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9962/  cell-cycle progression], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|initiation]], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17700065 transcriptional stress responses], [[protein]] stability, and [[Cell survival curve|survival of cells]] are signaling through mTOR.
[[File:MTOR complexes.png|thumb|Schematic components of the mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2]]
The [[serine/threonine kinase]] mTOR is a downstream effector of the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/AKT]] pathway, and forms two distinct [[multiprotein complex]]es, [[Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC1|mTORC1]] and [[Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC1|mTORC2]].<ref name=populo /> These two complexes have a separate network of protein partners, [[Feedback#Biology|feedback loops]], [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]], and regulators.<ref name=Vilar /> mTORC1 consists of mTOR and two positive regulatory subunits, [[KIAA1303|raptor]] and mammalian LST8 ([[mLST8]]), and two negative regulators, proline-rich AKT substrate 40 (PRAS40) and DEPTOR.<ref name=populo /> mTOR2 consists of mTOR, mLST8, [[MAPKAP1|mSin1]], protor, [[RICTOR|rictor]], and DEPTOR.<ref name=Meric-Bernstam />

mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin but mTORC2 is considered to be resistant and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. mTORC2 is activated by [[growth factor]]s, [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylates]] [[PKC alpha|PKCα]], [[AKT]] and [[paxillin]], and regulates the activity of the small [[GTPase]], [[Rac (GTPase)|Rac]], and [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] related to cell survival, [[Cell migration|migration]] and regulation of the [[Cytoskeleton|actin cytoskeleton]].
The mTORC1 signaling cascade is activated by phosphorylated AKT and results in phosphorylation of [[S6K1]], and [[EIF4EBP1|4EBP1]], which lead to [[mRNA translation]].<ref name=populo />

===mTOR signaling pathway in human cancer===
[[File:MTOR signal pathway.jpg|thumb|Signaling pathway of mTOR]]
Many human tumors occur because of dysregulation of mTOR signaling, and can confer higher susceptibility to inhibitors of mTOR.<ref name=Huang>{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=S|title=Targeting mTOR signaling for cancer therapy|journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology|date=1 August 2003|volume=3|issue=4|pages=371–377|doi=10.1016/S1471-4892(03)00071-7}}</ref> Deregulations of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway, like PI3K [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]]/[[mutation]], [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] loss of function, [[AKT]] overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1, and [[eIF4E]] overexpression have been related to many types of cancers. Therefore, mTOR is an interesting [[therapeutic target]] for treating multiple cancers, both the mTOR inhibitors themselves or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways.<ref name=populo />

Upstream, PI3K/AKT signalling is deregulated through a variety of mechanisms, including overexpression or activation of [[growth factor receptor]]s, such as [[HER-2]] (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and [[Insulin-like growth factor|IGFR]] (insulin-like growth factor receptor), mutations in [[PI3K]] and mutations/amplifications of AKT.<ref name=populo /> [[PTEN (gene)|Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue]] deleted on [[chromosome]] ten (PTEN) is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling. In many cancers the PTEN expression is decreased and may be downregulated through several mechanisms, including [[mutations]], [[loss of heterozygosity]], [[methylation]], and protein instability.<ref name=Meric-Bernstam>{{cite journal|last=Meric-Bernstam|first=F.|coauthors=Gonzalez-Angulo, A.

Downstream, the mTOR effectors S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), [[EIF4EBP1|eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1)]] and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) are related to cellular transformation.<ref name=populo /> S6K1 is a key regulator of cell growth and also phosphorylates other important targets. Both eIF4E and S6K1 are included in [[Transformation (genetics)|cellular transformation]] and their overexpression has been linked to poor cancer prognosis.<ref name="Meric-Bernstam"/>

==Development of mTOR inhibitors==
Since the discovery of mTOR, much research has been done on the subject, using rapamycin and rapalogs to understand its biological functions.<ref name=Vilar>{{cite journal|last=Vilar|first=E.|coauthors=Perez-Garcia, J.; Tabernero, J.|title=Pushing the Envelope in the mTOR Pathway: The Second Generation of Inhibitors|journal=Molecular Cancer Therapeutics|date=7 January 2011|volume=10|issue=3|pages=395–403|doi=10.1158/1535-7163.Mct-10-0905}}</ref><ref name=Ballou>{{cite journal|last=Ballou|first=Lisa M.|coauthors=Lin, Richard Z.|title=Rapamycin and mTOR kinase inhibitors|journal=Journal of Chemical Biology|date=15 May 2008|volume=1|issue=1-4|pages=27–36|doi=10.1007/s12154-008-0003-5}}</ref> The clinical results from targeting this pathway were not as straight forward as thought at first. Those results have changed the course of clinical research in this field.<ref name=Vilar />

Initially, rapamycin was developed as an antifungal drug against [[Candida albicans|''Candida albicanis'']], ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' and [[Cryptococcus neoformans|''Cryptocossus neoformans'']].<ref name=Faivre>{{cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Sandrine|coauthors=Kroemer, Guido; Raymond, Eric|title=Current development of mTOR inhibitors as anticancer agents|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|date=1 August 2006|volume=5|issue=8|pages=671–688|doi=10.1038/Nrd2062}}</ref> Few years later its immunosuppressive properties were detected. Later studies led to the establishment of rapamycin as a major immunosuppressant against [[transplant rejection]], along with [[cyclosporine A]].<ref name=Strimpakos /> By using rapamycin in combination with cyclosporin A, it enhanced the rejection prevention in [[renal transplantation]]. Therefore, it was possible to use lower doses of cyclosporine which minimized [[toxicity]] of the drug.<ref name=Faivre />

In the 1980s rapamycin was evaluated by the Developmental Therapeutic Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It was discovered that rapamycin had an anticancer activity and was a non-cytotoxic agent with cytostatic activity against several human cancer types.<ref name=Faivre /> However, due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, the development of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of cancer was not successful at that time.<ref name=Yuan>{{cite journal|last=Yuan|first=RuiRong|coauthors=Kay, Andrea; Berg, William J; Lebwohl, David|title=Targeting tumorigenesis: development and use of mTOR inhibitors in cancer therapy|journal=Journal of Hematology & Oncology|date=1 January 2009|volume=2|issue=1|pages=45|doi=10.1186/1756-8722-2-45}}</ref> Since then, rapamycin has also shown to be effective for preventing coronary artery [[Restenosis|re-stenosis]] and for the treatment of [[neurodegenerative diseases]].<ref name=Faivre />

===First generation mTOR inhibitors===
The development of rapamycin as an anticancer agent began again in the 1990s with the discovery of temsirolimus (CCI-779).  This was a novel soluble rapamycin derivative that had a favorable toxicological profile in animals.  More rapamycin derivatives with improved pharmacokinetics and reduced [[immunosuppressive]] effects have since then been developed for the [[Chemotherapy|treatment of cancer]].<ref name=Faivre /> These rapalogs include [[temsirolimus]] (CCI-779), [[everolimus]] (RAD001), and [[ridaforolimus]] (AP-23573) which are being evaluated in cancer [[clinical trial]]s.<ref name=Brachmann2>{{cite journal|last=Brachmann, S., et al|title=PI3K and mTOR inhibitors: a new generation of targeted anticancer agents|journal=Current opinion in cell biology|year=2009|volume=21|issue=2|pages=194–8|url=http://119.93.223.179/ScienceDirect/Current%20Opinion%20in%20Cell%20Biology/21-02/sdarticle_009.pdf}}</ref> Rapamycin analogs have similar therapeutic effects as rapamycin. However they have improved [[Hydrophile|hydrophilicity]] and can be used for oral and [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous administration]].<ref name=Tsang /> In 2012 [[National Cancer Institute]] listed more than 200 clinical trials testing the anticancer activity of rapalogs both as [[monotherapy]] or as a part of [[combination therapy]] for many cancer types.<ref name=Zaytseva>{{cite journal|last=Zaytseva|first=Yekaterina Y.|coauthors=Valentino, Joseph D.; Gulhati, Pat; Mark Evers, B.|title=mTOR inhibitors in cancer therapy|journal=Cancer Letters|date=1 June 2012|volume=319|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2012.01.005}}</ref>

Rapalogs, which are the first generation mTOR inhibitors, have proven effective in a range of [[preclinical]] models. However, the success in [[clinical trials]] can limited to only a few rare cancers.<ref name=ZHANG2011>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yan-Jie|coauthors=Duan, Yanwen; Zheng, X.F.

Another reason for the limited success is that there is a feedback loop between mTORC1 and AKT in certain tumor cells.

===Second generation mTOR inhibitors===
[[File:Dual inhibitors.jpg|thumb|Action point of first and second generation mTOR inhibitors on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]]The second generation of mTOR inhibitors is known as ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors.<ref name=Zaytseva /> mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors are designed to compete with ATP in the [[catalytic]] site of mTOR.  They inhibit all of the kinase-dependent functions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 and therefore, block the feedback activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, unlike rapalogs that only target mTORC1.<ref name=Zaytseva /><ref name=Ballou /> These types of inhibitors have been developed and several of them are being tested in clinical trials. Like rapalogs, they decrease protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]], attenuate [[cell cycle]] progression, and inhibit [[angiogenesis]] in many cancer cell lines and also in human cancer. In fact they have been proven to be more potent than rapalogs.<ref name=Zaytseva />
Theoretically, the most important advantages of these mTOR inhibitors is the considerable decrease of AKT phosphorylation on mTORC2 blockade and in addition to a better inhibition on mTORC1.<ref name=Vilar /> However, some drawbacks exists. Even though these compounds have been effective in rapamycin-insensitive cell lines, they have only shown limited success in [[KRAS]] driven tumors. This suggests that [[Combination therapy|combinational]] therapy may by necessary for the treatment of these cancers. Another drawback is also their potential [[toxicity]]. These facts have raised concerns about the long term efficacy of these types of inhibitors.<ref name=Zaytseva />

The close interaction of mTOR with the PI3K pathway has also led to the development of mTOR/PI3K dual inhibitors.<ref name=Zaytseva /> Compared with drugs that inhibit either mTORC1 or PI3K, these drugs have the benefit of inhibiting mTORC1, mTORC2, and all the catalytic [[isoforms]] of PI3K. Targeting both kinases at the same time reduces the [[upregulation]] of PI3K, which is typically produced with an inhibition on mTORC1.<ref name=Vilar /> The inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway has been shown to potently block proliferation by inducing [[G1 phase|G1]] arrest in different tumor cell lines. Strong induction of [[apoptosis]] and [[autophagy]] has also been seen. Despite good promising results, there are preclinical evidence that some types of cancers may be insensitive to this dual inhibition. The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are also likely to have increased toxicity.<ref name=Zaytseva />

==Mechanism of action==
The studies of [[Sirolimus|rapamycin]] as [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressive agent]] enabled us to understand its [[mechanism of action]].<ref name=Faivre /> It inhibits [[T cell|T-cell]] [[Cell growth|proliferation]] and proliferative responses induced by several [[cytokine]]s, including [[Interleukin 1 family|interleukin 1 (IL-1)]], [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]], [[Interleukin 3|IL-3]], [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], [[Insulin-like growth factor|IGF]], [[Platelet-derived growth factor|PDGF]], and [[Colony-stimulating factor|colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)]].<ref name=Faivre /> Rapamycin inhibitors and rapalogs can target tumor growth both directly and indirectly. Direct impact of them on cancer cells depend on the concentration of the drug and certain cellular characteristics. The indirect way, is based on interaction with processes required for tumor [[angiogenesis]].<ref name=Faivre />

===Effects in cancer cells===
[[File:Effects of Rapamycin and its rapalogs in cancer cells.png|thumb|400px|right|Effects of Rapamycin and rapalogs in cancer cells]]

Rapamycin and rapalogs crosslink the [[Immunophilins|immunophilin]] [[FKBP5|FK506]] binding protein, [[tacrolimus]] or FKBP-12, through its [[Methoxy|methoxy group]]. The rapamycin-FKBP12 complex interferes with FRB domain of mTOR.<ref name=Faivre /><ref name=Vignot2005 /> Molecular interaction between FKBP12, mTOR, and rapamycin can last for about three days (72 hours). The inhibition of mTOR blocks the binding of the accessory protein raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) to mTOR, but that is necessary for [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] phosphorylation of [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]] and [[EIF4EBP1|4EBP1]].<ref name=Faivre /><ref name=TANNEERU2 />
As a consequence, S6K1 dephosphorylates, which reduces protein [[Protein biosynthesis|synthesis]] and decreases cell motality and size. Rapamycin induces dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 as well, resulting in an increase in [[CDKN1B|p27]] and a decrease in [[cyclin D1]] expression. That leads to late blockage of G1/S [[cell cycle]]. Rapamycin has shown to induce cancer cell death by stimulating [[autophagy]] or [[apoptosis]], but the molecular mechanism of apoptosis in cancer cells has not yet been fully resolved. One suggestion of the relation between mTOR inhibition and apoptosis might be through the downstream target S6K1, which can phosphorylate [[Bcl-2-associated death promoter|BAD]], a pro-apoptotic molecule, on Ser136.<ref name=Faivre /> That reaction breaks the binding of BAD to [[Bcl-xL|BCL-XL]] and [[Bcl-2|BCL2]], a [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] death inhibitors, resulting in inactivation of BAD<ref name=Faivre /> and decreased cell survival.<ref name=Vignot2005 /> Rapamycin has also shown to induce [[p53]]-independent apoptosis in certain types of cancer.<ref name=Faivre />

===Effects on tumor angiogenesis===
[[File:Effects of Rapamycin and rapalogs on endothelial and tumor cells.png|thumb|300px|right|Effects of Rapamycin and rapalogs on endothelial and tumor cells.]]
Tumor angiogenesis rely on interactions between [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|endothelial vascular growth factors]] which can all activate the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/AKT/mTOR]] in endothelial cells, [[pericyte]]s, or cancer cells. Example of these growth factors are [[Angiopoietin 1|angiopoietin 1 (ANG1)]], ANG 2, [[Basic fibroblast growth factor|basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)]], [[EFNB2|ephrin-B2]], [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|vascular enothelial growth factor (VEGF)]], and members of the [[TGF beta|tumor growth factor-β (TGFβ)]] superfamily. One of the major stimuli of angiogenesis is hypoxia, resulting in activation of [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs)]] and expression of ANG2, bFGF, PDGF, VEGF, and VEGFR. Inhibition of HIF1α translation by preventing PDGF/PDGFR and VEGF/VEGFR can result from mTOR inhibition. A G0-G1 cell-cycle blockage can be the consequence of inactivation of mTOR in hypoxia-activated pericytes and endothelial cells.<ref name=Faivre />

There are some evidence that extended therapy with rapamycin may have effect on [[AKT]] and mTORC2 as well.<ref name=Strimpakos /><ref name="Garcia‑Echeverria">{{cite journal|last=Garcia‑Echeverria|first=Carlos|title=Blocking the mTOR pathway: a drug discovery perspective|journal=Biochemical Society Transactions|date=1 April 2011|volume=39|issue=2|pages=451–455|doi=10.1042/BST0390451}}</ref>

==Structure activity relationship==

The pipecolate region of rapamycin structure seems necessary for rapamycin-binding to [[FKBP1A|FKBP12]]. This step is required for further binding of rapamycin to the mTOR kinase, which is the key enzyme in many biological actions of rapamycin.<ref name=Ritacco>{{cite journal|last=Ritacco|first=F.V|title=Production of Novel rapamycin Analogs by Precursor-Directed Biosynthesis|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2005|volume=71|issue=4|pages=1971–1976|pmc=1082568|pmid=15812028|doi=10.1128/AEM.71.4.1971-1976.2005}}</ref>

The high affinity of rapamycin binding to FKBP12 is explained by number of [[hydrogen bond]]s trough two different [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] binding pockets, and this has been revealed by X-ray crystal structure of the compound bound to the [[protein]].  The structural characteristics common to temsirolimus and sirolimus; the [[pipecolic acid]], tricarbonyl region from C13-C15, and [[lactone]] functionalities play the key role in binding groups with the FKBP12.<ref name="Brachmann2"/><ref name=Bok-gooog>{{cite book|last=Hall, M.N, and Tamanoi F.|title=Structure, Function and Regulation of TOR complexes from Yeasts to Mammals|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|isbn=0123815398|pages=329–360}}</ref>

The most important [[hydrogen bonds]] are the lactone carbonyl oxygen at C-21 to the backbone NH of [[Isoleucine|Ile56]], amide carbonyl at C-15 to the phenolic group on the sidechain of [[Tyrosine|Tyr82]], and the hydroxyl proton at the [[hemiketal]] carbon, C-13, to the sidechain of [[Asparagine|Asp37]].<ref name=Bok-gooog />
[[File:Bygging copy.jpg|thumb|400px|down right|'''Binding sites of rapamycin''': Green ring (pipecolate region) represents binding region to FKBP12 and purple ring represents binding region to mTOR]]
Structural changes to the rapamycin structure can affect binding to mTOR. This could include both direct and indirect binding as a part of binding to FKBP12. Interaction of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex with mTOR corresponds with conformational flexibility of the effector domain of rapamycin. This domain consists of molecular regions that make hydrophobic interactions with the FKB domain and [[Polyene|triene]] region from C-1-C-6, methoxy group at C-7, and [[methyl group]]s at C-33, C-27 and C-25. All changes of the macrolide ring can have unpredictible effects on binding and therefore, make determination of [[Structure-activity relationship|SAR]] for rapalogs problematic.<ref name=Bok-gooog /><ref name=BARRISH2>{{cite book|first=edited by Joel C. Barrish ... [et|title=Accounts in drug discovery : case studies in medicinal chemistry|year=2010|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=1849731268}}</ref>

Rapamycin contains no functional groups that [[Ionization|ionize]] in the [[pH]] range 1-10 and therefore, are rather insoluble in water.<ref name=Simamora2001>{{cite journal|last=Simamora|first=Pahala|coauthors=Alvarez, Joan M; Yalkowsky, Samuel H|title=Solubilization of rapamycin|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|date=1 February 2001|volume=213|issue=1-2|pages=25–29|doi=10.1016/s0378-5173(00)00617-7}}</ref> Despite its effectiveness in preclinic cancer models, its poor solubility in water, stability, and the long half-life elimination made its parenteral use difficult, but the development of soluble rapamycin analogs vanquished various barriers.<ref name=Strimpakos />

Nonetheless, the rapamycin analogs that have been approved for human use are modified at C-43 hydroxyl group and show improvement in [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] parameters as well as drug properties, for example solubility.<ref name=BARRISH2 />

Rapamycin and temsirolimus have similar chemical structures and bind to FKBP12, though their mechanism of action differs.<ref name="Brachmann2"/>

Temsirolimus is a dihydroxymethyl propionic [[acid]] [[ester]] of rapamycin, and its first derivative.<ref name=Strimpakos /> Therefore it is more water soluble and due to its watersolubility it can be given by intravenous formulation.<ref name=Vignot2005>{{cite journal|last=Vignot|first=S.|title=mTOR-targeted therapy of cancer with rapamycin derivatives|journal=Annals of Oncology|date=3 March 2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=525–537|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdi113}}</ref><ref name="Brachmann2"/>

Everolimus has O-2 hydroxyethyl chain substitution and deforolimus has a [[phosphine oxide]] substitution at position C-43 in the lactone ring of rapamycin.<ref name="Brachmann2"/>

Deforolimus (Ridaforolimus ) has C43 secondary alcohol moiety of the cyclohexyl group of Rapamycin that was substituted with phosphonate and phosphinate groups, preventing the high-affinity binding to mTOR and FKBP. Computional modelling studies helped the synthesise of the compound.<ref name=Vignot2005 />

==Biomarkers==
Identification of predictive [[biomarker]]s of efficacy for tumor types that are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors remains a major issue.<ref name=populo>{{cite journal|last=Pópulo, H.,|coauthors=J.M. Lopes, and P. Soares|title=The mTOR Signalling Pathway in Human Cancer|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|year=2012|volume=13|issue=2|pages=1886–1918|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/13/2/1886/htm}}</ref><ref name=Delbado>{{cite journal|last=Delbaldo, C.,|coauthors=Albert,S., Dreyer, C., Sablin, M.P.,|title=Predictive biomarkers for the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors|journal=Targeted oncology|year=2011|volume=6|issue=2|pages=119–124}}</ref>
Possible predictive biomarkers for [[Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors#Response_Criteria|tumor response]] to mTOR inhibitors, as have been described in [[glioblastoma]], [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[prostate cancer]] cells, may be the differential expression of mTOR pathway proteins, [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]], [[AKT]], and S6.<ref name=populo /> Thus, this data is based on preclinical assays, based on ''[[in vitro]]'' cultured tumor cell lines, which suggest that the effects of mTOR inhibitors may be more pronounced in cancers displaying loss of PTEN functions or [[PIK3CA]] mutations. However, the use of PTEN, PIK3CA [[mutation]]s, and AKT–phospho status for predicting rapalog sensitivity has not been fully validated in clinic. To date, attempts to identify biomarkers of rapalog response have been unsuccessful.<ref name=Wander22>{{cite journal|last=Wander|first=Seth A.|coauthors=Hennessy, Bryan T.; Slingerland, Joyce M.|title=Next-generation mTOR inhibitors in clinical oncology: how pathway complexity informs therapeutic strategy|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=1 April 2011|volume=121|issue=4|pages=1231–1241|doi=10.1172/JCI44145}}</ref>

===Sensitivity===
Clinical and translational data suggest that sensitive tumor types, with adequate parameters and functional [[apoptosis]] pathways, might not need high doses of mTOR inhibitors to trigger apoptosis. In most cases, cancer cells might only be partially sensitive to mTOR inhibitors due to rebundant [[signal transduction]] or lack of functional apoptosis signaling pathways. In situations like this, high doses of mTOR inhibitors might be required. In recent study of patients with [[Renal cell carcinoma]], resistance to Temsirolimus was associated with low levels of p-AKT and p-S6K1, that play the key role in mTOR activation. These data strongly suggests number of tumors with an activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that does not respond to mTOR inhibitors. For future studies it is recommended to exclude patients with low or negative p-AKT levels from trials with mTOR inhibitors.
Current data is insufficient to predict sensitivity of tumors to rapamycin. However, the existing data allows us to characterize tumors that might not respond to rapalogs.<ref name=Faivre />

==ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors==

These second generation mTOR inhibitors bind to ATP-binding site in mTOR kinase domain required for the functions of both [[Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC1|mTORC1]] and [[Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC2|mTORC2]], and result in [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] of mTOR signaling pathway. Due to PI3K and mTORC2 ability to regulate AKT phosphorylation, these two compounds play a key role in minimizing the feedback activation of AKT.<ref name=ZHANG2011 />

===mTOR/PI3K dual inhibitors===
Several, so-called mTOR/PI3K dual inhibitors (TPdIs), have been developed and are in early-stage [[Pre-clinical development|preclinical trials]] and show promising results. Their development has been benefited from previous studies with PI3K-selective inhibitors.<ref name=ZHANG2011 /> The activity of these small molecules from rapalog activity differs in the way by blocking both mTORC1-dependent phospholylation of S6K1 and mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 residue.<ref name=populo />
[[File:Nvp.png|thumb|150px|left|Nvp|NCP-BEZ235 chemical structure]]
Dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitors include NVP-BEZ235, BGT226, SF1126, PKI-587 and many more. For example, [[Novartis]] has developed the compound NVPBE235 that was reported to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical models. It enhances antitumor activity of some other drugs such as [[vincristine]].<ref name=ZHANG2011 /> NVP-BEZ235 seems to inhibit effectively both wild-type and mutant form of PIK3CA, which suggests its use towards wide types of tumors. Studies have shown superior antiproliferative activity to rapalogs and ''[[in vivo]]'' models have confirmed these potent [[antineoplastic]] effects of dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitors.<ref name=populo /><ref name=Zaytseva /> These inhibitors target [[isoforms]] of PK3I (p110α, β and γ) along with ATP-binding sites of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by blocking PI3K/AKT signaling, even in cancer types with mutations in this pathway.<ref name=Zaytseva />

===mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors (TORCdIs)===

[[File:Ink-128.png|thumb|up right|150px|Ink-128| INK-128: chemical structure]]
New mTOR-specific inhibitors came forth from screening and [[drug discovery]] efforts. These compounds block activity of both mTOR complexes and are called mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors.<ref name=ZHANG2011 /> Compounds with this characteristics such as INK128, AZD8055, and AZD2014 have entered [[clinical trial]]s.
A series of these mTOR kinase inhibitors have been studied. Their structure is derived from morpholino pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold.<ref name=ZHANG2011 /><ref name=TANNEERU2>{{cite journal|last=Tanneeru|first=Karunakar|coauthors=Guruprasad, Lalitha|title=Ligand-based 3-D pharmacophore generation and molecular docking of mTOR kinase inhibitors|journal=Journal of Molecular Modeling|date=30 July 2011|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1611–1624|doi=10.1007/s00894-011-1184-3}}</ref>
Improvements of this type of inhibitors have been made by exchanging the morpholines with bridged morpholines in pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitors and results showed increased selectivity to mTOR by 26000 fold.<ref name=TANNEERU2 /><ref name=NOWAK>{{cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Pawel|coauthors=Cole, Derek C.; Brooijmans, Natasja; Bursavich, Matthew G.; Curran, Kevin J.; Ellingboe, John W.; Gibbons, James J.; Hollander, Irwin; Hu, YongBo; Kaplan, Joshua; Malwitz, David J.; Toral-Barza, Lourdes; Verheijen, Jeroen C.; Zask, Arie; Zhang, Wei-Guo; Yu, Ker|title=Discovery of Potent and Selective Inhibitors of the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Kinase|journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|date=26 November 2009|volume=52|issue=22|pages=7081–7089|doi=10.1021/jm9012642}}</ref>

===Limitations of new generation mTOR inhibitors===
Although the new generation of mTOR inhibitors hold great promise for anticancer therapy and are rapidly moving into clinical trials, there are many important issues that determine their success in the clinic. First of all predictable biomarkers for benefit of these inhibitors are not available. It appears that genetic determinants predispose cancer cells to be sensitive or resistant to these compounds. Tumors that depend on PI3K/mTOR pathway should respond to these agents but it is unclear if compounds are effective in cancers with distinct genetic lesions.<ref name=ZHANG2011 />

Inhibition of mTOR is a promising strategy for treatment of number of cancers. Limited clinical activity of selective mTORC1 agents have made them unlikely to have impact in cancer treatment. The development of compatitive ATP-catalytic inhibitors have the ability to block both mTORC1 and mTORC2.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Altman, J. K.|coauthors=Sassano, A. Platanias, L. C.|title=Targeting mTOR for the treatment of AML. New agents and new directions.|journal=Oncotarget|year=2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=510–517}}</ref>

==Future==
The limitations of currently available rapalogs have led to new approaches to mTOR targeting. Studies suggest that mTOR inhibitors may have anticancer activity in many cancer types, such as [[Renal cell carcinoma|RCC]], [[neuroendocrine tumors]], [[breast cancer]], [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], [[sarcoma]], and [[large B-cell lymphoma]].<ref name=Yuan />
One major limitation for the development of mTOR inhibition therapy is that biomarkers are not presently available to predict which patient will respond to them.  A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the response of cancer cells to mTOR inhibitors are still required so this can by possible.<ref name=Zaytseva />

A way to overcome the resistance and improve efficacy of mTOR targeting agents may be with stratification of patients and selection of drug combination therapies.  This may lead to a more effective and personalized cancer therapy.<ref name=populo /><ref name=Zaytseva /> Although further research is needed, mTOR targering still remains an attractive and promising therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer.<ref name=Zaytseva />
