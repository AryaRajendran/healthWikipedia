'''Case Western Reserve School of Medicine''' ('''CWRU SOM, CaseMed''') is one of the graduate schools of [[Case Western Reserve University]], and is located in the [[University Circle]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. The School of Medicine is among the top 25 [[medical school]]s in [[USA|America]] and is the top-ranked medical school of [[Ohio]] in research per [[U.S. News & World Report]].<ref>http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/research-rankings</ref>  
Additionally, Case School of Medicine is the largest biomedical research center in Ohio.<ref>Case-UH largest biomedical research center in Ohio - http://casemed.case.edu/clinicalactivities/affiliates.cfm</ref> In 2011, the average MCAT score for the entering class was 35.

Prospective students have the option of three degree paths leading to a medical degree at the School of Medicine: the "University Program;" the "College Program" at the [[Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine|Cleveland Clinic]]; and the [[Medical Scientist Training Program]] (MSTP).

In 2002, the School of Medicine became only the third institution in history to receive the best review possible from the body that grants accreditation to U.S. and Canadian medical degree programs, the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]].<ref>http://www.case.edu/bulletin/09-11/medicine_general.htm</ref>

==History==

On November 1, 1843, five faculty members and sixty-seven students began the first medical lectures at the Medical Department of Western Reserve College (also known as the Cleveland Medical College).<ref>http://casemed.case.edu/about/history.cfm</ref>
[[File:CaseMed in 1843.jpg|thumb|right|Medical Department of Western Reserve College 1843-1885 located at E. 9th and St. Clair.]]The School of Medicine has trained medical students, served the community, and been at the forefront of discovery in the City of [[Cleveland]] for over 165 years. A '''historical photo gallery''' is available at: http://casemed.case.edu/about/photogallery.cfm

[[File:Emily Blackwell.jpg|thumb|right| [[Emily Blackwell]] â€“ 1854 MD alumnus. CaseMed graduated six of the first  seven women to receive U.S. allopathic medical degrees.]]
'''Women in Medicine:''' In 1852, the medical school became the second in the U.S. to graduate a woman, [[Nancy Talbot Clarke]]. 1854 MD alumnus, [[Emily Blackwell]] became the third woman in the US to receive a regular medical degree. Six of the first seven women in the United States to receive medical degrees from recognized allopathic medical schools graduated from Western Reserve University between 1850 and 1856.

'''Flexner Survey:'''
In 1909, [[Arbraham Flexner]], a graduate of [[Johns Hopkins University]] surveyed and evaluated each of the one hundred and fifty-five medical schools then extant in North America. The results of his investigation proved shocking: most "medical schools," for example, had entrance requirements no more stringent than either high school diploma or "rudiments or the recollection of a common school education." [[File:cover of the Medical School catalog of 1868-69.jpg|thumb|left| Cover of the Medical School catalog of 1868-69.]]Only sixteen schools required at least two years of college as an entrance requirement, and of these, [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Harvard]], and [[Western Reserve]] were still the only ones to require an undergraduate degree. Although Johns Hopkins represented his ideal, Flexner also singled out the Medical Department of Western Reserve University for its praiseworthy admission standards and facilities. Flexner referred to Western Reserve as "already one of the substantial schools in the country." In a letter to Western Reserve president [[Charles Franklin Thwing]] he said, "The Medical Department of Western Reserve University is, next to Johns Hopkins..., the best in the country."

'''Western Reserve Curriculum:''' A little over forty years later, in 1952, the Western Reserve University School of Medicine revolutionized medical education with the "new curriculum of 1952" and more advanced stages in 1968. This was the most progressive medical curriculum in the country at that time, integrating the basic and clinical sciences.

'''Research History:''' Development of the modern technique for human blood transfusion using a cannula to connect blood vessels; first large-scale medical research project on humans in a study linking iodine with goiter prevention; pioneering use of drinking water chlorination; discovery of the cause of ptomaine food poisoning and development of serum against it and similar poisons; first surgical treatments of coronary artery disease; discovery of early treatment of strep throat infections to prevent rheumatic fever; development of an early heart-lung machine to be used during open-heart surgery; discovery of the Hageman factor in blood clotting, a major discovery in blood coagulation research; first description of how staphylococcus infections are transmitted, leading to required hand-washing between patients in infant nurseries; first description of what was later named Reye's syndrome; research leading to FDA approval of [[clozapine]], the most advanced treatment for schizophrenia in 40 years at the time; discovery of the gene for osteoarthritis; and creation with Athersys, Inc., of the world's first human artificial chromosome.

'''Integrated MD/PhD Training:''' In 1956, CWRU School of Medicine began an explicit M.D. and Ph.D. dual-degree training program. This served as a template for other research medical schools who quickly adopted the idea. In 1964, the [[National Institutes of Health]] began to fund some of these programs through its prestigious [[Medical Scientist Training Program]] (MSTP). Today, the MSTP trains nearly a thousand students at any given time.

'''CaseMed Today:''' Today the CWRU School of Medicine is the largest biomedical research institution in Ohio and one of the largest in the nation, as measured by funding received from the National Institutes of Health. The School of Medicine has eight [[Nobel Prize]] holders among its alumni and former and current faculty, and also has graduates who have distinguished themselves as U.S. Surgeons General: [[Jesse Steinfeld]], MD, and [[David Satcher]], MD, PhD, and the current the Director of the CDC, [[Julie Gerberding]], MD.

==Education==
<!-- More information needed. -->

Building on its reputation for innovation in medical education, the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine introduced the WR<sup>2</sup> curriculum with the class entering in 2006.  The goal of the new curriculum is to unite the disciplines of medicine and public health.  It is designed to emphasize independent study, and scheduling choices, while providing mentored experiences in research during the first 18 months of school.  All students are required to complete a dedicated four month research block during their second, third, or fourth year of study.

===Small Group Learning===
Small group learning is a central part of the curriculum. Students are required to review selected readings and engage in their own research to prepare for these sessions. When the group convenes, the students discuss their findings, fascinating an active and engaged learning process. Furthermore, the participation guidelines are structured in a manner to simulate the type of small-group experiences students will encounter with attending physicians in their clinical years (as medical students and medical residents).

===Primary Teaching Hospitals===
[[File:Case-UH affiliation.jpg|thumb|right| In 1896, the first affiliation agreement was approved between Western Reserve University and [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]]<ref>http://casemed.case.edu/about/photogallery.cfm?StartRecord=16</ref>]]

* [[University Hospitals|University Hospitals Case Medical Center]]
* [[Cleveland Clinic]]
* [[MetroHealth Medical Center]]
* [[Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center]]

===Other Teaching Affiliates===

* [[St. Vincent Charity Hospital]]
* [[The Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland]]

===Degree Programs===
In addition to the traditional MD degree, students have the option of completing one of several dual degree programs of varying lengths at no additional cost.  Currently, the school has dual degree programs that offer:

* [[MD/PhD]] - Through the [[Medical Scientist Training Program]]
* MD/DMD - Combined Medical Doctor and [[Doctor of Dental Medicine]] Program
* [[MD/MPH]] - Combined Medical Doctor and Master of Public Health
* [[MD/MBA]] - Combined Medical Doctor and Master of Business Administration
* MD/MA in Bioethics
* MD/MS in Applied Anatomy
* MD/MS in Biomedical Investigation
* MD/MS in Biomedical Engineering
* MD/MA or MD/PhD in Anthropology

==Student life==

===Societies===
[[File:Allen Memorial Medical Library Exterior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Allen Memorial Medical Library]]]]
Case Medical School is divided into four societies named after famous CaseMed alums.  Upon matriculation, students in the University Program are assigned to a society.  Each has a Society Dean who serves as an academic adviser to the students.   The societies are:

*  [[Frederick C. Robbins]] Society
*  [[Emily Blackwell]] Society
*  [[David Satcher]] Society
*  [[Joseph Wearn]] Society

Every year, the four societies compete in "ISC Picnic" for the infamous Society Cup in a series of events (e.g. soccer, flag football, relay races etc.) to test physical talents of the students in each society.

===Doc Opera===
Every year, students at Case Western Reserve SOM write, direct and perform a full length musical parody, lampooning Case Western Reserve, their professors, and themselves.  In recent years, the show has been a benefit for the [[Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland]].

==In popular culture==
* The 1997 ''[[Air Force One (movie)]]'' was in part filmed on Case campus. The opening scene depicting the presidential palace of the leader of Kazakhstan was shot at [[Severance Hall]] - home of the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] adjacent to Case campus. Also seen are several landmarks of Case including the Thwing Center (the student union) and the [[Allen Memorial Medical Library]].

* In the 1999 film ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', [[Mary Kay Place]]'s character - Floris - is mentioned to have received "her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western."

* In the 2003 book ''[[Mountains Beyond Mountains]]'', [[Tracy Kidder]] talks about [[Paul Farmer]] choosing to apply to only two MD/PhD-anthropology programs in the nation - [[CaseMed]] and Harvard Medical School.<ref>Kidder T. Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World. Random House (2004). p64.</ref>

* The [[United States presidential election debates, 2004|2004 Vice-Presidential Debate]] between then Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] and Senator [[John Edwards]] was held on Case Western campus.<ref>Cheney and Edwards Vice presidential debate: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/debatereferee/debate_1005.html</ref>
