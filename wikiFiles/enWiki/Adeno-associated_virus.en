'''Adeno-associated virus (AAV)''' is a small [[virus]] which infects humans and some other primate species. AAV is not currently known to cause [[disease]] and consequently the virus causes a very mild [[immune response]]. [[Gene therapy]] [[Vectors in Gene Therapy|vectors]] using AAV can infect both dividing and quiescent cells and persist in an extrachromosomal state without integrating into the [[genome]] of the host cell. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for [[gene therapy]], and for the creation of [[isogenic human disease models]].<ref name="GriegerSamulski2005">{{cite journal |author=Grieger JC, Samulski RJ |title=Adeno-associated virus as a gene therapy vector: vector development, production and clinical applications |journal=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/biotechnology |volume=99 |issue= |pages=119–45 |year=2005 |pmid=16568890 |doi=10.1007/10_005 |series=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology |isbn=3-540-28404-4}}</ref> Recent human clinical trials using [[Adeno associated virus and gene therapy of the human retina|AAV for gene therapy in the retina]] have shown promise.<ref name=AMMaguire2008>{{cite journal |author=Maguire AM, Bennett JB et al |title=Safety and Efficacy of Gene Transfer for Leber's Congenital Amaurosis |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=358 |issue=21 |pages=2240–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18441370 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa0802315 |pmc=2829748}}</ref>

AAV belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Dependovirus]]'', which in turn belongs to the [[family (biology)|family]] ''[[Parvoviridae]]''.  The virus is a small (20 [[nanometre|nm]]) [[Replication-defective virus|replication-defective]], [[Enveloped virus|nonenveloped virus]].

== Advantages and drawbacks ==
Wild-type AAV has attracted considerable interest from gene therapy researchers due to a number of features. Chief amongst these is the viruses' apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human [[chromosome]] 19.<ref name="KotinSiniscalco1990">{{cite journal |author=Kotin RM, Siniscalco M, Samulski RJ, ''et al.'' |title=Site-specific integration by adeno-associated virus|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=2211–5 |date=1 March 1990|pmid=2156265 |pmc=53656 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/87/6/2211.full.pdf+html?sid=b3e80d13-02c4-437f-95f7-a9032aaacb2a |doi=10.1073/pnas.87.6.2211}}</ref><ref name="SuroskyUrabe1997">{{cite journal |author=Surosky RT, Urabe M, Godwin SG, ''et al.'' |title=Adeno-associated virus Rep proteins target DNA sequences to a unique locus in the human genome |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=71 |issue=10 |pages=7951–9 |date=1 October 1997|pmid=9311886 |pmc=192153 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9311886 }}</ref> The feature makes it somewhat more predictable than [[retrovirus]]es, which present the threat of a random insertion and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a [[cancer]]. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random incorporations into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAV's as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the ''rep'' and ''cap'' from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in concatamer formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatamers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatamers remain intact for the life of the host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at very low frequency. AAV's also present very low [[immunogenicity]], seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing [[antibodies]], while they induce no clearly defined [[Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity|cytotoxic response]].<ref name="ChirmulePropert1999">{{cite journal |author=Chirmule N, Propert K, Magosin S, Qian Y, Qian R, Wilson J |title=Immune responses to adenovirus and adeno-associated virus in humans |journal=Gene Therapy |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=1574–83 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10490767 |doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3300994}}</ref><ref name="HernandezWang1999">{{cite journal |author=Hernandez YJ, Wang J, Kearns WG, Loiler S, Poirier A, Flotte TR |title=Latent Adeno-Associated Virus Infection Elicits Humoral but Not Cell-Mediated Immune Responses in a Nonhuman Primate Model |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=73 |issue=10 |pages=8549–58 |date=1 October 1999|pmid=10482608 |pmc=112875 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10482608 }}</ref><ref name="PonnazhaganMukherjee1997">{{cite journal |author=Ponnazhagan S, Mukherjee P, Yoder MC, ''et al.'' |title=Adeno-associated virus 2-mediated gene transfer in vivo: organ-tropism and expression of transduced sequences in mice |journal=Gene |volume=190 |issue=1 |pages=203–10 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=9185868 |doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(96)00576-8}}</ref> This feature, along with the ability to infect [[G0 phase|quiescent cells]] present their dominance over [[adenovirus]]es as vectors for the human [[gene therapy]].

Use of the virus does present some disadvantages. The cloning capacity of the vector is relatively limited and most therapeutic genes require the complete replacement of the virus's 4.8 kilobase genome. Large genes are, therefore, not suitable for use in a standard AAV vector. Options are currently being explored to overcome the limited coding capacity. The AAV ITRs of two genomes can anneal to form head to tail concatamers, almost doubling the capacity of the vector. Insertion of splice sites allows for the removal of the ITRs from the transcript.

The humoral immunity instigated by infection with the wild type is thought to be a very common event. The associated neutralising activity limits the usefulness of the most commonly used serotype AAV2 in certain applications. Accordingly the majority of clinical trials currently underway involve delivery of AAV2 into the brain, a relatively immunologically privileged organ. In the brain, AAV2 is strongly neuron-specific.

== Clinical trials ==
To date, AAV vectors have been used in over 80 clinical trials worldwide.<ref>J. of Gene Medicine, http://www.abedia.com/wiley/vectors.php</ref> Recently, promising results have been obtained from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for a number of diseases, including [[Leber's Congenital Amaurosis]],<ref name="Maguire 2008">Maguire, A.

Trials for the treatment of [[prostate cancer]] have reached phase III,<ref name="Carter2005"/> however these ex vivo studies do not involve direct administration of AAV to patients.

== Pathology ==
AAV is not considered to have any known role in disease. It has been suggested to have a role in male [[infertility]],<ref name="pmid11679515">{{cite journal |author=Erles K, Rohde V, Thaele M, Roth S, Edler L, Schlehofer JR |title=DNA of adeno-associated virus (AAV) in testicular tissue and in abnormal semen samples |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=2333–7 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11679515 |doi=10.1093/humrep/16.11.2333}}</ref> as AAV DNA is more commonly found in semen samples from men with abnormal semen. However, no causal link has been found between AAV infection and male infertility.

== AAV structure ==
=== AAV genome, transcriptome and proteome ===
The AAV genome is built of single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ss[[DNA]]), either positive- or negative-sensed, which is about 4.7 kilobase long. The genome comprises inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) at both ends of the DNA strand, and two [[open reading frame]]s (ORFs): ''rep'' and ''cap''. The former is composed of four overlapping genes encoding Rep proteins required for the AAV life cycle, and the latter contains overlapping nucleotide sequences of [[capsid]] proteins: VP1, VP2 and VP3, which interact together to form a capsid of an icosahedral symmetry.<ref name="Carter2000">{{Cite book

==== ITR sequences ====
The Inverted Terminal Repeat (ITR) sequences comprise 145 bases each. They were named so because of their symmetry, which was shown to be required for efficient multiplication of the AAV genome.<ref name="BohenzkyLefebvreBerns1988">{{cite journal |author=Bohenzky RA, LeFebvre RB, Berns KI |title=Sequence and symmetry requirements within the internal palindromic sequences of the adeno-associated virus terminal repeat |journal=Virology |volume=166 |issue=2 |pages=316–27 |year=1988 |month=October |pmid=2845646 |doi=10.1016/0042-6822(88)90502-8}}</ref> Another property of these sequences is their ability to form a [[Stem-loop|hairpin]], which contributes to so-called self-priming that allows [[primase]]-independent synthesis of the second DNA strand. The ITRs were also shown to be required for both integration of the AAV DNA into the host cell genome (19th chromosome in humans) and rescue from it,<ref name="WangPonnazhagan1995">{{cite journal |author=Wang XS, Ponnazhagan S, Srivastava A |title=Rescue and replication signals of the adeno-associated virus 2 genome |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=250 |issue=5 |pages=573–80 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7623375 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1995.0398}}</ref><ref name="WeitzmanKyostio1994">{{cite journal |author=Weitzman MD, Kyöstiö SR, Kotin RM, Owens RA |title=Adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep proteins mediate complex formation between AAV DNA and its integration site in human DNA |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=91 |issue=13 |pages=5808–12 |year=1994 |month=June |pmid=8016070 |pmc=44086 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.13.5808}}</ref> as well as for efficient encapsidation of the AAV DNA combined with generation of a fully assembled, [[deoxyribonuclease]]-resistant AAV particles.<ref name="ZhouMuzyczka1998">{{cite journal |author=Zhou X, Muzyczka N |title=In Vitro Packaging of Adeno-Associated Virus DNA |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=3241–7 |date=1 April 1998|pmid=9525651 |pmc=109794 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9525651 }}</ref>

With regard to gene therapy, ITRs seem to be the only sequences required ''[[cis-acting|in cis]]'' next to the therapeutic gene: structural (''cap'') and packaging (''rep'') genes can be delivered ''[[trans-acting factors|in trans]]''.  With this assumption many methods were established for efficient production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors containing a [[reporter gene|reporter]] or therapeutic gene.  However, it was also published that the ITRs are not the only elements required ''in cis'' for the effective replication and encapsidation.  A few research groups have identified a sequence designated ''cis-acting Rep-dependent element'' (CARE) inside the coding sequence of the ''rep'' gene.  CARE was shown to augment the replication and encapsidation when present ''in cis''.<ref name="NonyTessier2001">{{cite journal |author=Nony P, Tessier J, Chadeuf G, ''et al.'' |title=Novel cis-Acting Replication Element in the Adeno-Associated Virus Type 2 Genome Is Involved in Amplification of Integrated rep-cap Sequences |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=75 |issue=20 |pages=9991–4 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11559833 |pmc=114572 |doi=10.1128/JVI.75.20.9991-9994.2001}}</ref><ref name="NonyChadeuf2003">{{cite journal |author=Nony P, Chadeuf G, Tessier J, Moullier P, Salvetti A |title=Evidence for Packaging of rep-cap Sequences into Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Type 2 Capsids in the Absence of Inverted Terminal Repeats: a Model for Generation of rep-Positive AAV Particles |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=776–81 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12477885 |pmc=140600 |doi=10.1128/JVI.77.1.776-781.2003}}</ref><ref name="PhilpottGiraud2002">{{cite journal |author=Philpott NJ, Giraud-Wali C, Dupuis C, ''et al.'' |title=Efficient Integration of Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus DNA Vectors Requires a p5-rep Sequence in cis |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=5411–21 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=11991970 |pmc=137060 |doi=10.1128/JVI.76.11.5411-5421.2002}}</ref><ref name="TullisShenk2000">{{cite journal |author=Tullis GE, Shenk T |title=Efficient Replication of Adeno-Associated Virus Type 2 Vectors: a cis-Acting Element outside of the Terminal Repeats and a Minimal Size |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=74 |issue=24 |pages=11511–21 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11090148 |pmc=112431 |doi=10.1128/JVI.74.24.11511-11521.2000}}</ref>

==== ''rep'' genes and Rep proteins ====
On the "left side" of the genome there are two [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s called p5 and p19, from which two overlapping messenger ribonucleic acids ([[mRNA]]s) of different length can be produced. Each of these contains an [[intron]] which can be either [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]] out or not. Given these possibilities, four various mRNAs, and consequently four various Rep proteins with overlapping sequence can be synthesized. Their names depict their sizes in [[Atomic mass unit|kilodaltons]] (kDa): Rep78, Rep68, Rep52 and Rep40.<ref name="KyostioOwens1994">{{cite journal |author=Kyöstiö SR, Owens RA, Weitzman MD, Antoni BA, Chejanovsky N, Carter BJ |title=Analysis of adeno-associated virus (AAV) wild-type and mutant Rep proteins for their abilities to negatively regulate AAV p5 and p19 mRNA levels |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=2947–57 |date=1 May 1994|pmid=8151765 |pmc=236783 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8151765 }}</ref> Rep78 and 68 can specifically bind the [[Stem-loop|hairpin]] formed by the ITR in the self-priming act and cleave at a specific region, designated terminal resolution site, within the hairpin.

All four Rep proteins were shown to bind [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and to possess [[helicase]] activity.

==== ''cap'' genes and VP proteins ====
The right side of a positive-sensed AAV genome encodes overlapping sequences of three capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, which start from one promoter, designated p40. The molecular weights of these proteins are 87, 72 and 62 kiloDaltons, respectively.<ref name="JayLaughlin1981">{{cite journal |author=Jay FT, Laughlin CA, Carter BJ |title=Eukaryotic translational control: adeno-associated virus protein synthesis is affected by a mutation in the adenovirus DNA-binding protein |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=2927–31 |year=1981 |month=May |pmid=6265925 |pmc=319472 |doi=10.1073/pnas.78.5.2927}}</ref> All three of them are translated from one mRNA. After this mRNA is synthesized, it can be [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]] in two different manners: either a longer or shorter [[intron]] can be excised resulting in the formation of two pools of mRNAs: a 2.3 kb- and a 2.6 kb-long mRNA pool. Usually, especially in the presence of [[adenovirus]], the longer intron is preferred, so the 2.3-kb-long mRNA represents the so-called "major splice". In this form the first [[Start codon|AUG codon]], from which the synthesis of VP1 protein starts, is cut out, resulting in a reduced overall level of VP1 protein synthesis. The first AUG codon that remains in the major splice is the initiation codon for VP3 protein.

=== Other Serotypes ===
Although AAV2 is the most popular serotype in various AAV-based research, it has been shown that other serotypes can be more effective as gene delivery vectors.

== AAV immunology ==
AAV is of particular interest to gene therapists due to its apparent limited capacity to induce immune responses in humans, a factor which should positively influence vector transduction efficiency while reducing the risk of any immune-associated [[pathology]].

=== Innate ===
The [[innate immune system|innate]] immune response to the AAV vectors has been characterised in animal models. Intravenous administration in mice causes transient production of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s and some infiltration of [[neutrophil]]s and other [[leukocyte]]s into the liver, which seems to sequester a large percentage of the injected viral particles. Both soluble factor levels and cell infiltration appear to return to baseline within six hours. By contrast, more aggressive viruses produce innate responses lasting 24 hours or longer.<ref name="ZaissLiu2002">{{cite journal |author=Zaiss AK, Liu Q, Bowen GP, Wong NC, Bartlett JS, Muruve DA |title=Differential Activation of Innate Immune Responses by Adenovirus and Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=76 |issue=9 |pages=4580–90 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11932423 |pmc=155101 |doi=10.1128/JVI.76.9.4580-4590.2002}}</ref>

=== Humoral ===
The virus is known to instigate robust [[humoral immune system|humoral]] immunity in animal models and in the human population where up to 80% of individuals are thought to be [[seropositivity|seropositive]] for AAV2. [[antibody|Antibodies]] are known to be neutralising and for gene therapy applications these do impact on vector transduction efficiency via some routes of administration. As well as persistent AAV specific antibody levels, it appears from both prime-boost studies in animals and from clinical trials that the B-cell memory is also strong.<ref name="ZaissMuruve2005">{{cite journal |author=Zaiss AK, Muruve DA |title=Immune responses to adeno-associated virus vectors |journal=Current Gene Therapy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=323–31 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15975009 |doi=10.2174/1566523054065039}}</ref> In seropositive humans, circulating [[IgG]] antibodies for AAV2 appear to be primarily composed of the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses, with little or no IgG3 or IgG4 present.<ref name="Madsen2009" />

=== Cell-mediated ===
The [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated]] response to the virus and to vectors is poorly characterised and has been largely ignored in the literature as recently as 2005.<ref name="ZaissMuruve2005"/> Clinical trials using an AAV2-based vector to treat haemophilia B seem to indicate that targeted destruction of transduced cells may be occurring.<ref name="MannosHigh2006">{{cite journal |author=Manno CS, Pierce GF, Arruda VR, ''et al.'' |title=Successful transduction of liver in hemophilia by AAV-Factor IX and limitations imposed by the host immune response |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=342–7 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16474400 |doi=10.1038/nm1358}}</ref> Combined with data that shows that [[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T-cells]] can recognise elements of the AAV capsid ''in vitro'',<ref name="SabatinoHigh2005">{{cite journal |author=Sabatino DE, Mingozzi F, Hui DJ, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of mouse AAV capsid-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes |journal=Molecular Therapy |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=1023–33 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16263332 |doi=10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.09.009}}</ref> it appears that there may be a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to AAV vectors.

== AAV infection cycle ==
There are several steps in the AAV infection cycle, from infecting a cell to producing new infectious particles:
# attachment to the [[cell membrane]]
# [[endocytosis]]
# endosomal trafficking
# escape from the late [[endosome]] or [[lysosome]]
# translocation to the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]
# formation of double-stranded DNA replicative form of the AAV genome
# ''rep'' genes expression
# genome [[DNA replication|replication]]
# ''cap'' genes expression, synthesis of progeny ssDNA particles
# assembly of complete [[virion]]s, and
# release from the infected cell.

Some of these steps may look different in various types of cells, which, in part, contributes to the defined and quite limited native tropism of AAV. Replication of the virus can also vary in one cell type, depending on the cell's current [[cell cycle]] phase.<ref name="RohrKronenwett2002">{{cite journal |author=Rohr UP, Kronenwett R, Grimm D, Kleinschmidt J, Haas R |title=Primary human cells differ in their susceptibility to rAAV-2-mediated gene transfer and duration of reporter gene expression |journal=Journal of Virological Methods |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=265–75 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12270659 |doi=10.1016/S0166-0934(02)00117-9}}</ref>

The characteristic feature of the adeno-associated virus is a deficiency in replication and thus its inability to multiply in unaffected cells.  The first factor that was described as providing successful generation of new AAV particles, was the [[adenovirus]], from which the AAV name originated.

The minimal set of the adenoviral genes required for efficient generation of progeny AAV particles, was discovered by Matsushita, Ellinger ''et al.''.<ref name=MatsushitaElliger1998/> This discovery allowed for new production methods of recombinant AAV, which do  not require adenoviral co-infection of the AAV-producing cells.  In the absence of helper virus or genotoxic factors, AAV DNA can either integrate into the host genome or persist in [[episome|episomal]] form. In the former case integration is mediated by Rep78 and Rep68 proteins and requires the presence of ITRs flanking the region being integrated. In mice, the AAV genome has been observed persisting for long periods of time in quiescent tissues, such as skeletal muscles, in episomal form (a circular head-to-tail conformation).<ref name=DuanSharma1998>{{cite journal |author=Duan D, Sharma P, Yang J, ''et al.'' |title=Circular Intermediates of Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Have Defined Structural Characteristics Responsible for Long-Term Episomal Persistence in Muscle Tissue |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=8568–77 |date=1 November 1998|pmid=9765395 |pmc=110267 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9765395 }}</ref>
