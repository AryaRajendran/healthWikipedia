'''Necrotizing fasciitis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɛ|k|r|ə|ˌ|t|aɪ|z|ɪ|ŋ|_|ˌ|f|æ|ʃ|i|ˈ|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|æ|s|-}}) or '''NF''', commonly known as '''flesh-eating disease''' or '''flesh-eating bacteria syndrome''',<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini RP, Bolognia JL, Jorizzo JL |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 }}</ref> is a [[Rare disease|rare]] [[infection]] of the deeper layers of [[skin]] and [[Subcutis|subcutaneous tissues]], easily spreading across the [[fascia]]l plane within the subcutaneous tissue.

Necrotizing fasciitis is quickly progressing, having greater risk of developing in the immunocompromised due to conditions like [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], etc. It is a severe disease of sudden onset and is usually treated immediately with high doses of intravenous antibiotics. <ref>{{Cite journal |author=Jain A, Varma A, Mangalanandan Kumar PH, Bal A |title=Surgical outcome of necrotizing fasciitis in diabetic lower limbs |journal=Journal of Diabetic Foot Complications |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=80–84 }}</ref> 

Type I describes a polymicrobial infection, whereas Type II describes a monomicrobial infection. Many types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis (e.g., [[Group A streptococcal infection|Group A streptococcus (''Streptococcus pyogenes'')]], ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', ''[[Bacteroides fragilis]]'', ''[[Aeromonas hydrophila]]''<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/05/16/national/a145331D94.DTL&tsp=1 {{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref>). Such infections are more likely to occur in people with compromised [[immune systems]].<ref>{{Cite journal |volume=53|issue=5 |pages=1691–1697 |author=Kotrappa KS, Bansal RS, Amin NM |title=Necrotizing fasciitis |journal=American Family Physician |date=1996-04 |pmid=8623695
}}</ref>

Historically, Group A streptococcus made up most cases of Type II infections. However, since as early as 2001, another serious form of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis has been observed with increasing frequency,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee TC, Carrick MM, Scott BG, et al. |title=Incidence and clinical characteristics of methicillin-resistant fasciitis in a large urban hospital |journal=American Journal of Surgery |volume=194 |pages=809–13 |year=2007|pmid=18005776 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.08.047 |issue=6}}</ref> caused by [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA)]].

Some published case reports have implied a possible link between use of [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] and NF, though the evidence of the link was said to be weak because of a small number of case patients and it was unclear whether the drugs just masked the symptoms of a secondary infection or were a cause ''per se''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/puarticles/necf.htm|title=Necrotising Fasciitis Associated with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs|last=Voss|first=Lesley|date=November 2000|publisher=New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority}}</ref>

==Possible sources==
Possible sources of MRSA include purchasing and/or consuming undercooked contaminated meats,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120120182427.htm|title=MRSA found in meat}}</ref> being near human [[sewage sludge]] ([[human feces]]) spread on farm fields as fertilizer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ehp.1205436.pdf|title=MRSA found in wastewater byproducts}}</ref> consuming raw products produced from farm fields fertilized by human sewage sludge or septage, in hospital settings from patients of weakened immune systems,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/health/Dr-Ozs-Warning-About-MRSA-and-Deadly-Bacteria

==Signs and symptoms==
Over 70% of cases are recorded in patients with one of the following clinical situations: immunosuppression, diabetes, alcoholism/drug abuse/smoking, malignancies, and chronic systemic diseases. It occasionally occurs in people with an apparently normal general condition.<ref>

The infection begins locally at a site of [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], which may be severe (such as the result of [[surgery]]), minor, or even non-apparent. Patients usually complain of intense pain that may seem excessive given the external appearance of the skin. With progression of the disease, often within hours, tissue becomes swollen. Diarrhea and vomiting are also common symptoms.

In the early stages, signs of inflammation may not be apparent if the bacteria are deep within the tissue. If they are ''not'' deep, signs of inflammation, such as redness and swollen or hot skin, develop very quickly. [[Skin color]] may progress to violet, and blisters may form, with subsequent [[necrosis]] (death) of the [[subcutaneous tissue]]s.

Furthermore, patients with necrotizing fasciitis typically have a [[fever]] and appear very ill. Mortality rates have been noted as high as 73 percent if left untreated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/444061 |publisher=Medscape  |title =Necrotizing Fasciitis |author=Trent JT, Kirsner RS |date=2002 Nov 25 }}</ref> Without surgery and medical assistance, such as [[antibiotic]]s, the infection will rapidly progress and will eventually lead to death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/Necrotizing-Fasciitis-Flesh-Eating-Bacteria-Topic-Overview |title=Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria) |work=WebMD |date=2011 Oct 12 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Necrotizing fasciitis - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of necrotizing fasciitis, showing necrosis (center of image) of the dense connective tissue, i.e. [[fascia]], interposed between fat lobules (top-right and bottom-left of image). [[H&E stain]].]]
"Flesh-eating bacteria" is a [[misnomer]], as the bacteria do not actually "eat" the tissue. They cause the destruction of skin and muscle by releasing [[toxin]]s (virulence factors), which include streptococcal [[pyogenic]] [[exotoxins]]. ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' produces an exotoxin known as a [[superantigen]]. This toxin is capable of activating [[T-cell]]s non-specifically, which causes the overproduction of [[cytokines]] and severe systemic illness ([[Toxic shock syndrome]]).

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Pnecrotisingfasc.png|thumb|Necrotising fasciitis causing air in soft tissues]]
The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score can be utilized to risk stratify patients presenting with signs of [[cellulitis]] to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present.  It uses six serologic measures: [[C-reactive protein]], total [[white blood cell]] count, [[hemoglobin]], [[sodium]], [[creatinine]] and [[glucose]]. A score greater than 6 indicates that necrotizing fasciitis should be seriously considered. The scoring criteria are as follows:

*CRP (mg/L) ≥150: 4 points
*WBC count (×10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>)
**<15: 0 points
**15–25: 1 point
**>25: 2 points
*Hemoglobin (g/dL)
**>13.5: 0 points
**11–13.5: 1 point
**<11: 2 points
*Sodium (mmol/L) <135: 2 points
*Creatinine (umol/L) >141: 2 points
*Glucose (mmol/L) >10: 1 point<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wong CH, Khin LW, Heng KS, Tan KC, Low CO |year=2004 |title=The LRINEC (Laboratory Rother soft tissue infections |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=1535–1541 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000129486.35458.7D |pmid=15241098}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emergency-medicine-tutorials.org/Home/medical-3/infectious-diseases-1/bacterial/necrotising-fascitis/lrinec-scoring-system-for-necrotising-fascitis |title=LRINEC scoring system for necrotising fasciitis |work=EMT Emergency Medicine Tutorials }}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Necrotizing fasciitis left leg debridement.JPEG|thumb|Necrotic tissue from the left leg is being surgically debrided in a patient with necrotizing fasciitis (same patient as top).]]
Patients are typically taken to surgery based on a high index of suspicion, determined by the patient's signs and symptoms. In necrotizing fasciitis, aggressive surgical [[debridement]] (removal of infected tissue) is always necessary to keep it from spreading and is the only treatment available. Diagnosis is confirmed by visual examination of the tissues and by tissue samples sent for microscopic evaluation.

Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. Initial treatment often includes a combination of intravenous antibiotics including [[piperacillin/tazobactam]], [[vancomycin]], and [[clindamycin]]. Cultures are taken to determine appropriate antibiotic coverage, and antibiotics may be changed when culture results are obtained.

As in other maladies characterized by massive wounds or tissue destruction, [[hyperbaric oxygen]] treatment can be a valuable adjunctive therapy but is not widely available.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Escobar SJ, Slade JB, Hunt TK, Cianci P |title=Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) for treatment of necrotizing fasciitis reduces mortality and amputation rate |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=437–43 |year=2005 |pmid=16509286 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4061 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref> [[Amputation]] of the affected limb(s) may be necessary. Repeat explorations usually need to be done to remove additional necrotic tissue. Typically, this leaves a large open wound, which often requires [[skin grafting]], though necrosis of internal (thoracic and abdominal) viscera- such as intestinal tissue- are also possible. The associated systemic inflammatory response is usually profound, and most patients will require monitoring in an [[intensive care unit]]. Because of the extreme nature of many of these wounds and the grafting and debridement that accompanies such a treatment, a burn center's wound clinic, which has staff trained in such wounds, may be utilized. 

Treatment for necrotizing fasciitis may involve an interdisciplinary care team. For example, in the case of a necrotizing fasciitis involving the head and neck, the team could include otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, intensivists, microbiologists and plastic surgeons or oral and maxillofacial surgeons.<ref name=Malik>
