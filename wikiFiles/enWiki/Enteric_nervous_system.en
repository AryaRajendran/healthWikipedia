The '''enteric nervous system''' ('''ENS''') or '''intrinsic nervous system''' is one of the main divisions of the [[autonomic nervous system]] and consists of a mesh-like system of [[neuron]]s that governs the function of the [[gastrointestinal system]].<ref name="Furness2008" /> The human gastrointestinal tract is made up of the stomach and intestine. The enteric nervous system has a complete network of neurons, neurotransmitters, and special proteins responsible for communications, "thinking," "remembering," and "learning". As a result, the enteric nervous system is sometimes called a “second brain”<ref name="Furness2008">{{cite book|author=John Barton Furness|title=The Enteric Nervous System|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pvkpdNHhI6cC|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7344-5}}</ref> because the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines are lined with sheaths of tissue containing neurons that are "soaked" in the same neurotransmitters that exist in the brain and are influenced by them.

==Function==
The ENS is capable of autonomous functions<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000105286|enteric nervous system}}</ref> such as the coordination of [[reflex]]es; although it receives considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system, it can and does operate independently of the brain and the spinal cord.<ref>{{Gershon MD. The Second Brain Harper 1998 p17}}</ref>  Its study is the focus of [[neurogastroenterology]].

ENS function can be damaged by [[ischemia]].<ref name="pmid17375218">{{cite journal |author=Linhares GK, Martins JL, Fontanezzi F, Patrício Fdos R, Montero EF |title=Do lesions of the enteric nervous system occur following intestinal ischemia/reperfusion? |journal=Acta Cir Bras |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=120–4 |year=2007 |pmid=17375218 |doi= 10.1590/S0102-86502007000200008|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-86502007000200008&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref> Transplantation, which had been described as a theoretical possibility in earlier versions of this article,<ref name="pmid17369379">{{cite journal |author=Gershon MD |title=Transplanting the enteric nervous system: a step closer to treatment for aganglionosis |journal=Gut |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=459–61 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17369379 |doi=10.1136/gut.2006.107748 |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17369379 |pmc=1856867 }}</ref> is now (as of 2011) a clinical reality in the United States and is performed at a number of approved centers.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436543_2</ref>

==Anatomy==
The ENS consists of some one hundred million [[neuron]]s,<ref>{{cite book |title=Medical Physiology |last1=Boron |first1=Walter F. |first2=Emile L.|last2= Boulpaep |year=2005 |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location= |isbn=978-1-4160-2328-9 |page=883 }}</ref> one thousandth of the number of neurons in the [[brain]], and about one tenth the number of neurons in the spinal cord.  [Number of neurons in human spinal cord = 1 billion (from Kalat, J.W., Biological Psychology, 6th Edition, 1998, page 24).]  
The enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the [[gastrointestinal system]].

The neurons of the ENS are collected into two types of [[ganglia]]: [[myenteric plexus|myenteric (Auerbach's)]] and [[submucosal plexus|submucosal (Meissner's) plexuses]].<ref name="urlThe Enteric Nervous System">{{cite web |url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/basics/gi_nervous.html |title=The Enteric Nervous System |work= |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> Myenteric plexuses are located between the inner and outer layers of the [[muscularis externa]], while submucosal plexuses are located in the [[submucosa]].

==Complexity==
The enteric nervous system has been described as a "second brain" for several reasons. The enteric nervous system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) through the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] (e.g., via the [[vagus nerve]]) and [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] (e.g., via the [[prevertebral ganglia]]) nervous systems.  However, [[vertebrate]] studies show that when the [[vagus nerve]] is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function.<ref name="amjphysgastro">{{cite journal | url=http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/285/3/G461.full | title=Musings on the Wanderer: What's New in Our Understanding of Vago-Vagal Reflexes?

In vertebrates the enteric nervous system  includes [[efferent neurons]], [[afferent neuron]]s, and [[interneurons]], all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an [[integrating center]] in the absence of CNS input.  The sensory neurons report on mechanical and chemical conditions.  Through intestinal muscles, the motor neurons control [[peristalsis]] and churning of intestinal contents.  Other neurons control the secretion of [[enzymes]].  The enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 [[neurotransmitters]], most of which are identical to the ones found in CNS, such as [[acetylcholine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]]. More than 90% of the body's serotonin lies in the gut, as well as about 50% of the body's dopamine, which is currently being studied to further our understanding of its utility in the brain.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pasricha|first=Pankaj Jay|title=Stanford Hospital: Brain in the Gut - Your Health|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXx4WTVU34Y}}</ref>

The enteric nervous system has the capacity to alter its response depending on such factors as bulk and nutrient composition{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}. In addition, ENS contains support cells which are similar to [[astroglia]] of the brain and a diffusion barrier around the capillaries surrounding ganglia which is similar to the [[blood–brain barrier]] of [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] blood vessels.<ref>Silverthorn, Dee U.(2007)."Human Physiology".
