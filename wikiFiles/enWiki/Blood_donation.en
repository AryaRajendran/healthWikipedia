A '''blood donation''' occurs when a person [[free will|voluntarily]] has [[blood]] drawn and used for [[blood transfusion|transfusions]] and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called [[Blood fractionation|fractionation]] (separation of whole-blood components). Donation may be of whole-blood (WB), or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis). [[Blood bank]]s often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.

In the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers (voluntary non remunerated repeat donations, VNRD) who donate blood for a community supply. In poorer countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many donors donate as an act of charity, but some are paid and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as [[paid time off]] from work. Donors can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.

Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including [[HIV]] and [[viral hepatitis]]. The donor must also answer questions about [[medical history]] and take a short [[physical examination]] to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can give varies from days to months based on what he or she donates and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example in the United States, donors must wait eight weeks (56 days) between [[Blood_donation#Whole_blood|whole blood donations]] but only three days between [[Plateletpheresis|platelet pheresis donations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.givelife2.org/donor/faq.asp#3|title=FAQs About Donating Blood|accessdate=2009-10-26|publisher=American Red Cross Biomedical Services}}</ref>

The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary.  The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that only takes specific portions of the blood.  Most of the components of blood used for transfusions have a short [[shelf life]], and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. This has led to some increased interest in [[autotransfusion]], whereby a patient's blood is salvaged during surgery for continuous reinfusion - or alternatively, is "self-donated" ''prior'' to when it will be needed. (Generally the notion of "donation" does not refer to giving to one's ''self'', though in this context it has become somewhat acceptably idiomatic.)

== Types of donation ==

Blood donations are divided into groups based on who will receive the collected blood.<ref>M. E. Brecher, Editor (2005), ''AABB Technical Manual'', 15th edition, Bethesda, MD: AABB, ISBN 1-56395-196-7, p.98-103</ref>  An 'allogeneic' (also called 'homologous') donation is when a donor gives blood for storage at a [[blood bank]] for [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] to an unknown recipient.  A 'directed' donation is when a person, often a family member, donates blood for [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] to a specific individual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/donateblood/directed.html|title=Directed Donation|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=2008-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080524004449/http://www.mayoclinic.org/donateblood/directed.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-24}}</ref>  Directed donations are relatively rare when an established supply exists.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wales PW, Lau W, Kim PC |title=Directed blood donation in pediatric general surgery: Is it worth it? |journal=J.

When a person has blood stored that will be transfused back to the donor at a later date, usually after surgery, that is called an '[[autologous]]' donation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/Content/About_Blood/Facts_About_Blood_and_Blood_Banking/fabloodautoallo.htm|title=Autologous (self-donated) Blood as an Alternative to Allogeneic (donor-donated) Blood Transfusion|publisher=[[AABB]]|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>  Blood that is used to make medications can be made from allogeneic donations or from donations exclusively used for manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/Content/Members_Area/Members_Area_Regulatory/Blood_Component_Preparation_and_Testing/plasbpac061302.htm|title=Recovered Plasma|publisher=[[AABB]]|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>

Blood is sometimes collected using similar methods for [[therapeutic phlebotomy]], similar to the ancient practice of [[bloodletting]], which is used to treat conditions such as [[hereditary hemochromatosis]] or [[polycythemia vera]].  This blood is sometimes treated as a blood donation, but may be immediately discarded if it cannot be used for transfusion or further manufacturing.

The actual process varies according to the laws of the country, and recommendations to donors vary according to the collecting organization.<ref name="australiatips">{{cite web| url=http://www.donateblood.com.au/page.aspx?IDDataTreeMenu=45&parent=31 | title=Giving Blood -> What to Expect | publisher=Australian Red Cross Blood Service| accessdate=2007-10-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070829035341/http://donateblood.com.au/page.aspx?IDDataTreeMenu=45&parent=31 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-29}}</ref><ref name="canadatips">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodservices.ca/centreapps/internet/uw_v502_mainengine.nsf/page/The%20Donation%20Experience?OpenDocument| title=The Donation Experience| publisher=Canadian Blood Services| accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref><ref name="usarctips">{{cite web|url=http://www.givelife2.org/donor/tips.asp| title=Tips for a Good Donation Experience| publisher=American Red Cross| accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref>  The [[World Health Organization]] gives recommendations for blood donation policies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs279/en/|title = WHO Blood Safety and Donation|publisher = World Health Organization|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> but in developing countries many of these are not followed.

An event where donors come to donate allogeneic blood is sometimes called a '[[Wiktionary:blood drive|blood drive]]' or a 'blood donor session'.  These can occur at a blood bank, but they are often set up at a location in the community such as a shopping center, workplace, school, or house of worship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givelife2.org/sponsor/|title=Sponsoring a Blood Drive|publisher=American Red Cross|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>

==Screening==

Donors are typically required to give [[informed consent|consent]] for the process and this requirement means [[minor (legal)|minors]] cannot donate without permission from a parent or guardian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donateblood.com.au/admin%5Cfile%5Ccontent1%5Cc5%5Cwaconsent%20.pdf|format=pdf|title=Parental consent form|publisher=Australian Red Cross Blood Service|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref>  In some countries, answers are associated with the donor's blood, but not name, to provide anonymity; in others, such as the United States, names are kept to create lists of ineligible donors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=610.41|title=FDA regulations on donor deferral|accessdate=2008-06-01|publisher= US Food and Drug Administration}}</ref>  If a potential donor does not meet these criteria, they are 'deferred'.  This term is used because many donors who are ineligible may be allowed to donate later. Blood banks in the United States may be required to label the blood if it is from a therapeutic donor, so some do not accept donations from donors with any blood disease.<ref name="hemochromatosis guidance">{{cite web | title =Variances for Blood Collection from Individuals with Hereditary Hemochromatosis

===Recipient safety===

Donors are screened for health risks that could make the donation unsafe for the recipient.  Some of these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from [[MSM blood donor controversy|men who have sex with men]] for [[HIV]] risk.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/washington/24blood.html?_r=2&oref=slogin|title=Drug Agency Reaffirms Ban on Gay Men Giving Blood|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-26 | date=2007-05-24}}</ref> In 2011, the UK dropped its ban on homosexual donors.

Donors are examined for [[medical sign|signs]] and [[symptoms]] of diseases that can be transmitted in a [[blood transfusion]], such as [[HIV]], [[malaria]], and [[viral hepatitis]].  Screening may include questions about [[risk factors]] for various diseases, such as travel to countries at risk for [[malaria]] or [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease#variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)|variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)]]. These questions vary from country to country.  For example, while blood centers in [[Héma-Québec|Québec]], [[Poland]], and many other places defer donors who lived in the [[United Kingdom]] for risk of vCJD,<ref name="canadaCJD">{{cite web | title=Donor Qualification criteria | publisher=Héma-Québec, Canada |url=http://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca/anglais/dondesang/qualifidonneurs.htm | accessdate=2006-12-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061108025138/http://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca/anglais/dondesang/qualifidonneurs.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

===Donor safety===

[[File:Blood Donation at ITESM CCM.jpg|thumb|A college student in a campaign of blood donation.]]
The donor is also [[physical exam|examined]] and asked specific questions about their medical history to make sure that donating blood is not hazardous to their health.  The donor's [[hematocrit]] or [[hemoglobin]] level is tested to make sure that the loss of blood will not make them [[anemic]], and this check is the most common reason that a donor is ineligible.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gómez-Simón A |title=Evaluation of four rapid methods for hemoglobin screening of whole blood donors in mobile collection settings |journal=Transfus.

=== Blood testing ===

The donor's [[blood type]] must be determined if the blood will be used for transfusions.  The collecting agency usually identifies whether the blood is type [[ABO blood group system|A, B, AB, or O]] and the donor's [[Rhesus blood group system|Rh (D) type]] and will screen for [[antibodies]] to less common antigens.  More testing, including a [[crossmatch]], is usually done before a transfusion.  Group O is often cited as the "universal donor"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/blood-type-test|title=Blood Type Test|publisher=WebMD.com|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> but this only refers to [[Red Blood Cells|red cell]] transfusions.  For [[blood plasma|plasma]] transfusions the system is reversed and AB is the universal donor type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donatebloodnow.org/apheresis/docs/Plasma_Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title= Plasma fact sheet|publisher=American Red Cross}}</ref>

Most blood is tested for diseases, including some [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhattacharya P |title=Significant increase in HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis infections among blood donors in West Bengal, Eastern India 2004-2005: exploratory screening reveals high frequency of occult HBV infection |journal=World J.

The blood is usually discarded if these tests are positive, but there are some exceptions, such as [[autologous]] donations.  The donor is generally notified of the test result.<ref>{{cite journal |author=R. Miller, P.E. Hewitt, R. Warwick, M.C. Moore, B. Vincent |title=Review of counselling in a transfusion service: the London (UK) experience |journal=Vox Sang |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=133–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9595639 |doi=10.1046/j.1423-0410.1998.7430133.x}}</ref>

Donated blood is tested by many methods, but the core tests recommended by the World Health Organization are these four:

*[[Hepatitis B]] Surface Antigen
*Antibody to [[Hepatitis C]]
*Antibody to [[HIV]], usually [[Subtypes of HIV|subtypes 1 and 2]]
*Serologic test for [[Syphilis]]

The WHO reported in 2006 that 56 out of 124 countries surveyed did not use these basic tests on all blood donations.<ref name="WBDD 2006"/>

A variety of other tests for [[transfusion transmitted infections]] are often used based on local requirements.  Additional testing is expensive, and in some cases the tests are not implemented because of the cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/acmsbtt/msbtsum280605.pdf|title=Advisory Committee on MSBTO, 28 June 2005|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref>  These additional tests include other infectious diseases such as [[West Nile Virus]].<ref name="westnile">{{cite web | title=Precautionary West Nile virus blood sample testing| publisher=Héma-Québec, Canada

For example, the [[HIV]] antibody [[HIV test|test]] will not detect a recently infected donor, so some blood banks use a [[p24 antigen]] or [[Nucleic acid test|HIV nucleic acid]] test in addition to the basic antibody test to detect infected donors during that period.  [[Cytomegalovirus]] is a special case in donor testing in that many donors will test positive for it.<ref name="Circular of Information">{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/Documents/About_Blood/Circulars_of_Information/coi0702.pdf|title=Circular of Information for use of Blood and Blood Products|publisher=[[AABB]], [[American Red Cross|ARC]], [[America's Blood Centers]]|format=pdf}}</ref>  The virus is not a hazard to a healthy recipient, but it can harm infants<ref name="neonatal-rbc1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/fn/fn02-02.htm#What%20type%20of%20RBCs%20should%20be%20used |title=Red blood cell transfusions in newborn infants: Revised guidelines |publisher=Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) |accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> and other recipients with weak immune systems.<ref name="Circular of Information"/>

==Obtaining the blood==

[[File:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|300px|A donor's arm at various stages of donation. The two photographs on the left show a blood pressure cuff being used as a tourniquet.]]
There are two main methods of obtaining blood from a donor.  The most frequent is to simply take the blood from a vein as [[whole blood]].  This blood is typically separated into parts, usually [[red blood cells]] and [[blood plasma|plasma]], since most recipients need only a specific component for transfusions.  A typical donation is 450 millilitres (or approximately one US pint)<ref name="Mayo">{{cite web|url= http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-donation/GA00039|title=Blood donation: What to expect|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate =2008-12-03}}</ref> of [[whole blood]], though 500 millilitre donations are also common.  Historically, blood donors in [[India]] would donate only 250 or 350 millilitre and donors in the [[People's Republic of China]] would donate only 200 millilitres, though larger 300 and 400 millilitre donations have become more common.<ref name = "China">{{cite journal|title=Who donates blood at five ethnically and geographically diverse blood centers in China in 2008|author=Jingxing Wang|journal=Transfusion|publisher=AABB|volume=50|date=December 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02722.x|author-separator=,|author2=Nan Guo (corresponding)|display-authors=2|last3=Guo|first3=Xiaoming|last4=Li|first4=Julin|last5=Wen|first5=Guo-Xing|last6=Yang|first6=Tonghan|last7=Yun|first7=Zhongqiao|last8=Huang|first8=Yi|last9=Schreiber|first9=George B.|issue=12|pages=2686–94|pmid=20553435}}</ref>

The other method is to draw blood from the donor, separate it using a [[centrifuge]] or a filter, store the desired part, and return the rest to the donor.  This process is called [[apheresis]], and it is often done with a machine specifically designed for this purpose.  This process is especially common for [[plasmapheresis|plasma]] and [[plateletpheresis|platelets]].

For direct [[transfusions]] a vein can be used but the blood may be taken from an [[artery]] instead.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sagi E, Eyal F, Armon Y, Arad I, Robinson M |title=Exchange transfusion in newborns via a peripheral artery and vein |journal=Eur.

===Site preparation and drawing blood===

The blood is drawn from a large arm [[superficial vein|vein close to the skin]], usually the [[median cubital vein]] on the inside of the elbow.

The most common method is collecting the blood from the donor's vein into a container.  The amount of blood drawn varies from 200 milliliters to 550 milliliters depending on the country, but 450-500 milliliters is typical.<ref name="Circular of Information"/>  The blood is usually stored in a flexible plastic bag that also contains [[sodium citrate]], [[phosphate]], [[dextrose]], and sometimes [[adenine]].  This combination keeps the blood from clotting and preserves it during storage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Akerblom O, Kreuger A |title=Studies on citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) blood supplemented with adenine |journal=Vox Sang. |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=90–100 |year=1975 |pmid=238338 |doi= 10.1111/j.1423-0410.1975.tb00484.x|url=}}</ref>  Other chemicals are sometimes added during [[Whole blood#Processing|processing]].

The plasma from whole blood can be used to make [[blood plasma#Fresh frozen plasma and other transfused plasmas|plasma for transfusions]] or it can also be processed into other medications using a process called [[blood fractionation|fractionation]].  This was a development of the [[blood plasma#Dried plasma|dried plasma]] used to treat the wounded during [[World War II]] and variants on the process are still used to make a variety of other medications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm|title=Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment|publisher=Office of Medical History ([[OTSG]])|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

===Apheresis===
{{Main|Apheresis|Erythrocytapheresis|Plasmapheresis|Plateletpheresis}}

[[File:Blood Donation 12-07-06 1.JPG|thumb|A relatively large needle is used for blood donations.]]
Apheresis is a blood donation method where the blood is passed through an apparatus that separates out one particular constituent and returns the remainder to the donor.  Usually the component returned is the red blood cells, the portion of the blood that takes the longest to replace.  Using this method an individual can donate [[plasmapheresis|plasma]] or [[Plateletpheresis|platelets]] much more frequently than they can safely donate whole blood.<ref>[http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/b8apher.html Component Donation] UK National Blood Service. Retrieved 2009-10-26</ref>  These can be combined, with a donor giving both plasma and platelets in the same donation.

[[Platelets]] can also be separated from [[whole blood]], but they must be pooled from multiple donations.  From three to ten units of whole blood are required for a [[therapeutic dose]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scbcinfo.org/publications/bulletin_v2_n2.htm|title=Indications for Platelet Transfusion Therapy|publisher=Southeastern Community Blood Center|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>  Plateletpheresis provides at least one full dose from each donation.

[[Plasmapheresis]] is frequently used to collect [[source plasma]] that is used for manufacturing into medications much like the plasma from whole blood.  Plasma collected at the same time as plateletpheresis is sometimes called ''concurrent plasma''.  

Apheresis is also used to collect more red blood cells than usual in a single donation (commonly known as "[[Erythrocytapheresis|double reds]]") and to [[leukapheresis|collect white blood cells]] for transfusion.<ref name="dblred-ubs">{{cite web|url = http://www.unitedbloodservices.org/automation.html|title = Double Up to Save Lives|publisher = [[United Blood Services]]|accessdate = 2007-02-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061230200404/http://www.unitedbloodservices.org/automation.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-30}}</ref><ref name="dblred-arccpr">{{cite web| url = http://www.my-redcross.org/index.cfm/p/Double-Red-Cell| title = Double the Difference| publisher = [[American Red Cross]] (Greater Chesapeake and Potomac)| accessdate = 2007-02-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513184529/http://www.my-redcross.org/index.cfm/p/Double-Red-Cell <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-13}}</ref>

==Recovery and time between donations==

Donors are usually kept at the donation site for 10–15 minutes after donating since most adverse reactions take place during or immediately after the donation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eder AF, Hillyer CD, Dy BA, Notari EP, Benjamin RJ |title=Adverse reactions to allogeneic whole blood donation by 16- and 17-year-olds |journal=JAMA |volume=299 |issue=19 |pages=2279–86 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18492969 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.19.2279 |url=}}</ref>  Blood centers typically provide light refreshments or a lunch allowance to help the donor recover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siba2.unile.it/ese/issues/288/660/RelazDonazSanguigne_p6.pdf| title=Report on the promotion by Member States of voluntary unpaid blood donation|publisher=Commission of the European Communities|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref>  The needle site is covered with a [[bandage#Compression bandage|bandage]] and the donor is directed to keep the bandage on for several hours.<ref name="Mayo"/> In hot climates, donors are advised to avoid dehydration (strenuous games, alcohol) until a few hours after donation.

Donated plasma is replaced after 2–3 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbccts.org/donating/automated.htm|title=Donating Apheresis and Plasma|publisher=Community Blood Center|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>  Red blood cells are replaced by bone marrow into the circulatory system at a slower rate, on average 36 days in healthy adult males. In one study, the range was 20 to 59 days for recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pottgiesser T, Specker W, Umhau M, Dickhuth HH, Roecker K, Schumacher YO |title=Recovery of hemoglobin mass after blood donation |journal=Transfusion |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=1390–7 |year=2008 |month=Jul |pmid=18466177 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01719.x |url=}}</ref>  These replacement rates are the basis of how frequently a donor can donate blood.

[[Plasmapheresis]] and [[plateletpheresis]] donors can give much more frequently because they do not lose significant amounts of red cells. The exact rate of how often a donor can donate differs from country to country.  For example, plasmapheresis donors in the United States are allowed to donate large volumes twice a week and could nominally give 83 liters (about 22 gallons) in a year, whereas the same donor in Japan may only donate every other week and could only donate about 16 liters (about 4 gallons) in a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/03/transcripts/4014T2.htm|title=Blood Products Advisory Committee, 12 December 2003|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> Red blood cells are the limiting step for whole blood donations, and the frequency of donation varies widely depending on the type of donor and local policies.  For example, adult men in Hong Kong can donate once every three months, women every four months, and youth aged sixteen or seventeen only every six months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5.ha.org.hk/rcbts/template?series=19&article=90|title=Blood Donation|publisher=Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service | accessdate= 23 July 2011}}</ref>  In Canada and the United States it is 56 days for any type of donor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmbb.org/whole_blood.html|title=Donating Whole Blood|publisher=Lane Memorial Blood Bank|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodservices.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/Donor+FAQs?OpenDocument#02|title=Canadian Blood Services Donor FAQs|accessdate=2011-05-19}}</ref>

==Complications==
Donors are screened for health problems that would put them at risk for serious complications from donating.  First-time donors, teenagers, and women are at a higher risk of a reaction.<ref name="pmid18492969">{{cite journal |author=A.F. Eder, C.D. Hillyer, B.A. Dy, E.P. Notari, R.J.

An analysis of all reports from October 2008 to September 2009 evaluated six events and found that five of the deaths were clearly unrelated to donation, and in the remaining case they found no evidence that the donation was the cause of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/TransfusionDonationFatalities/ucm204763.htm#post|title=Fatalities Reported to FDA|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref>

[[File:Blooddonation.jpg|thumb|right|Bruising three days after donation]]
[[Hypovolemia|Hypovolemic]] reactions can occur because of a rapid change in [[blood pressure]]. [[Fainting]] is generally the worst problem encountered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wiltbank TB, Giordano GF, Kamel H, Tomasulo P, Custer B |title=Faint and prefaint reactions in whole-blood donors: an analysis of predonation measurements and their predictive value |journal=Transfusion |volume= 48|issue= 9|pages= 1799–808|year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18482188 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01745.x |url=}}</ref>

The process has similar risks to other forms of [[phlebotomy]].  [[Hematoma|Bruising]] of the arm from the needle insertion is the most common concern.  One study found that less than 1% of donors had this problem.<ref name="bruising">{{cite journal |author=Ranasinghe E, Harrison JF |title=Bruising following blood donation, its management and the response and subsequent return rates of affected donors |journal=Transfus Med |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=113–6 |year=2000 |month=Jun |pmid=10849380 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-3148.2000.00240.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0958-7578&date=2000&volume=10&issue=2&spage=113}}
</ref>  A number of less common complications of blood donation are known to occur.

</ref> 

Donors sometimes have adverse reactions to the [[sodium citrate]] used in [[apheresis]] collection procedures to keep the blood from clotting.  Since the anticoagulant is returned to the donor along with blood components that are not being collected, it can bind the [[calcium]] in the donor's blood and cause [[hypocalcemia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bolan CD, Greer SE, Cecco SA, Oblitas JM, Rehak NN, Leitman SF |title=Comprehensive analysis of citrate effects during plateletpheresis in normal donors |journal=Transfusion |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1165–71 |year=2001 |month=Sep |pmid=11552076 |doi=10.1046/j.1537-2995.2001.41091165.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0041-1132&date=2001&volume=41&issue=9&spage=1165}}</ref>  These reactions tend to cause tingling in the lips, but may cause convulsions, seizure, hypertension, or more serious problems.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sorensen, BS, Johnsen, SP, Jorgensen, J.|title= Complications related to blood donation: A population-based study |journal= Vox Sanguinis |date= Feb2008 |volume= 94 |issue= 2 |pages= 132–137|doi= 10.1111/j.1423-0410.2007.01000.x |pmid= 18028259}}</ref> Donors are sometimes given calcium supplements during the donation to prevent these side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/services/biomed/0,1082,0_543_,00.html|title=Jerome H.

In [[apheresis]] procedures, the [[red blood cells]] are returned.  If this is done manually and the donor receives the blood from a different donor, a [[transfusion reaction]] can take place.  Manual apheresis is extremely rare in the developed world because of this risk and automated procedures are as safe as whole blood donations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wiltbank TB, Giordano GF |title=The safety profile of automated collections: an analysis of more than 1 million collections |journal=Transfusion |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=1002–5 |year=2007 |month=Jun |pmid=17524089 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01224.x |url=}}</ref>

The final risk to blood donors is from equipment that has not been properly [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]].  In most cases, the equipment that comes in direct contact with blood is discarded after use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibts.ie/generic.cfm?mID=2&sID=9|title=Blood Donor Information Leaflet|publisher=Irish Blood Transfusion Service|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref>  Re-used equipment was a significant problem in [[China]] in the 1990s, and up to 250,000 blood plasma donors may have been exposed to HIV from shared equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/webaids5.htm|title=Keeping China's blood supply free of HIV|publisher=US Embassy, Beijing|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen J |title=HIV/AIDS in China.

==Storage, supply and demand==

===Storage and blood shelf life===
{{main|Blood bank}}

The collected blood is usually stored in a [[blood bank]] as separate components, and some of these have short shelf lives.  There are no storage solutions to keep '''platelets''' for extended periods of time, though some are being studied as of 2008.<ref name=Beard>{{cite journal|title=In Vitro Evaluation of Buffy Coat Derived Platelet Concentrates in SSP+ Platelet Storage Medium|last1=Beard|first1=M.|last2=Garwood|first2=M.|last3=Cookson|first3=P.|last4=Bashir|first4=S.|last5=Hancock|first5=V.|last6=Pergande|first6=C.|last7=Smith|first7=K.|last8=Turner|first8=C.|last9=Wiltshire|first9=M.|journal=Transfusion Medicine |year=2006|volume=16|pages=26|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.2006.00694_4.x}}</ref>  The longest shelf life used for platelets is seven days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transfusionguidelines.org.uk/index.asp?Publication=HTM&Section=9&pageid=1106|title=Transfusion Handbook, summary information for Platelets|publisher=National Blood Transfusion Committee|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>  

Red blood cells (RBC), the most frequently used component, have a shelf life of 35–42 days at refrigerated temperatures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lockwood WB, Hudgens RW, Szymanski IO, Teno RA, Gray AD |title=Effects of rejuvenation and frozen storage on 42-day-old AS-3 RBCs |journal=Transfusion |volume=43 |issue=11 |pages=1527–32 |year=2003 |month=Nov |pmid=14617310 |doi= 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00551.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0041-1132&date=2003&volume=43&issue=11&spage=1527}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://transfusionguidelines.org.uk/Index.aspx?Publication=HTM&Section=9&pageid=1105|title=Transfusion handbook, Summary information for Red Blood Cells|accessdate=2008-06-02|publisher=National Blood Transfusion Committee}}</ref>  For (relatively rare) long-term storage applications, this can be extended by freezing the blood with a mixture of [[glycerol]], but this process is expensive and requires an extremely cold freezer for storage.<ref name="Circular of Information"/>  

Plasma can be stored frozen for an extended period of time and is typically given an expiration date of one year and maintaining a supply is less of a problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agmed.sante.gouv.fr/ang/pdf/glffpl.pdf|title=Transfusion of Fresh Frozen Plasma, products, indications|publisher=Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

===Demand for blood===
The limited storage time means that it is difficult to have a stockpile of blood to prepare for a disaster.  The subject was discussed at length after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, and the consensus was that collecting during a disaster was impractical and that efforts should be focused on maintaining an adequate supply at all times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d021095t.pdf|title=Maintaining an Adequate Blood Supply Is Key to Emergency Preparedness|publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]]|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> Blood centers in the U.S. often have difficulty maintaining even a three day supply for routine transfusion demands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.americasblood.org/plsql/ecat/supply_monitor_pkg.web_report|title=Current status of America's Blood Centers blood supply|publisher=America's Blood Centers}}</ref>
