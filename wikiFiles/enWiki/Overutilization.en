Similarly, '''overtreatments''' are unnecessary medical interventions ([[therapies]]). They could be medical services for a condition that causes no symptoms and will go away on its own, or intensive treatments for a condition that could be remedied with very limited treatment. [[Overdiagnosis]], when patients are given a diagnosis that will cause no symptoms or harm, can lead to overtreatment.

==Cost, quality and policy implications==
In the United States, overutilization is a costly expense that lowers the quality of health care. {{Quotation|Between $.30 and $.40 of every dollar spent on health care is spent on the costs of poor quality. This extraordinary number represents slightly more than a half-trillion dollars a year [in 2005]. A vast amount of money is wasted on overuse, underuse, misuse, duplication, system failures, unnecessary repetition, poor communication, and inefficiency.<ref>{{cite book |title=Building a Better Delivery System: A New Engineering/Health Care Partnership – Bridging the Quality Chasm |last=Lawrence |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-65406-8 |page=99 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11378.html}}</ref>}}

==Contributing factors and examples==
Factors that contribute to overutilization include "[[Physician self-referral|self-referral]], patient wishes, inappropriate financially motivated factors, health system factors, industry, media, lack of awareness" and [[defensive medicine]].<ref name="Globally"/>

===Third-party payers and fee-for-service===
{{See also|Fee-for-service}}

When patients have their expenses covered by public or private insurance, and doctors are paid under a fee-for-service (FFS) model, neither have an [[incentive]] to consider the cost of treatment, a combination which contributes to waste.<ref name="Waste">{{Cite journal | author=[[Victor R.

The decision is whether we are going to reward the leaders who are trying to build a new generation of Mayos and Grand Junctions. If we don’t, McAllen won’t be an outlier.

The [[Canadian Association of Radiologists]] estimates that 30% of imaging is unnecessary in the [[Health care in Canada|Canadian health care system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.car.ca/uploads/patient%20info/car_cat_scan_eng.pdf |title=Do you need that scan? |year=2009 |publisher=[[Canadian Association of Radiologists]] |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}</ref>

===Politics===
The 2010 U.S. health care reform, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], did not contain serious strategies to reduce overutilization; "the public has made it clear that it does not want to be told what medical care it can and cannot have".<ref name="MayDoLittle"/> [[Uwe Reinhardt]], a health economist at Princeton, said "the minute you attack overutilization you will be called a Nazi before the day is out".<ref name="MayDoLittle"/>
