'''Smile surgery''' or smile reconstruction is a surgical procedure that restores the smile for people with [[facial nerve paralysis]]. Facial nerve paralysis is a relatively common condition with a yearly incidence of 0.25% leading to function loss of the mimic muscles.<ref name="Werker">{{cite journal |author=Werker, P.M.N |title=Plastische chirurgie bij patienten met een aangezichtsverlamming |journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Geneeskunde |volume=151 |pages=287–294 |year=2007 |url=http://www.ntvg.nl/publicatie/plastische-chirurgie-bij-patiënten-met-een-aangezichtsverlamming }}</ref> The facial nerve gives off several branches in the face.

Smile surgery is performed as a static or dynamic reconstruction. An example of static reconstruction is upper and lower lip shortening or thickening with commissure preservation.<ref name="Cerio">D.R. Cerio, "Facial nerve paralysis, static reconstruction", 2009, http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1289348-overview</ref> Dynamic smile reconstruction procedures restore the facial nerve activity.

==Historical background==

The first known surgical repair of an injured facial nerve was performed by Drobnick in 1879, who connected the proximal spinal accessory nerve (innervates trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles) to the paralysed facial nerve. More symmetrical features were the result. In 1971 a new technique for facial nerve reconstruction was introduced, as Scaramella and Smith reported on the technique of cross facial nerve grafting (CFNG) for reconstruction of a coordinated smile in unilateral facial paralysis cases. Harii et al. for the first time used a [[free muscle transfer]] in combination with a nerve transfer in 1976. Eight years later, Terzis introduced the "babysitter" procedure, which consists of a combination of CFNGs and a simultaneous partial hypoglossal to facial nerve transfer. In 1989, Zuker et al. suggested the use of the masseteric nerve as possible donor nerve for innervation of the transplanted muscle in patients with [[Moebius syndrome]].<ref name="Terzis"/>

==Indications==

The main indications for dynamic smile reconstruction are unilateral or bilateral facial paralysis due to acquired and congenital causes.<ref name="Terzis"/> Trauma, Bell's palsy and tumour extirpation are examples of secondary or acquired facial paralysis. [[Bell's palsy]] or idiopathic facial paralysis is a condition which leads to facial paralysis, however, without a known cause. It has an acute onset and is mostly self-limiting. But if spontaneous recurrence of (near) normal function does not take place, surgical reanimation may be indicated. Some head and neck tumours invade or compress the facial nerve leading to facial paresis or paralysis. Examples of such tumours are facial neuromas, cholesteatomas, [[haemangiomas]], [[acoustic neuromas]], parotid gland neoplasms or [[metastases]]. Sometimes, the facial nerve cannot be preserved during resection of these tumours.

Congenital facial paralysis occurs usually unilaterally and may be complete or incomplete. The most common congenital cause is the [[Moebius syndrome]]. Moebius syndrome is a congenital neurological disorder with bilateral paralysis of both the facial and abducens nerves. Therefore, lateral eye movement and facial animation are absent. In Moebius-like syndrome, only one side of the face is affected, but with additional nerve palsies of the affected facial and [[abducens nerve]].<ref name="Bianchi"/>

Selection of the type of nerve transfer is based on the individualised needs and condition of the patient. Individual factors can be patient age, type of paralysis (partial or complete, uni- or bilateral), denervation time of the mimetic muscles, availability of nerve grafts and medical condition of the patient.<ref name="Terzis"/>

If facial paralysis is caused by trauma or tumour surgery, direct reinnervation of the facial muscles (ideally within 72 hours after facial nerve damage) can be achieved by neurorrhaphy, with or without an interposition nerve graft.

[[File:Cross facial nerve graft.jpg|thumb|right|Cross facial nerve graft]]In more long standing acquired facial paralysis either a CFNG procedure or "baby-sitter" procedure are the indicated techniques, with or without a free muscle transfer.(Algorithm 1)<ref name="Terzis"/> Secondary facial paralysis with a denervation time of less than 6 months can be treated with one or more cross facial nerve grafts (CFNGs).<ref name="Terzis"/> During a cross facial nerve graft procedure one or more branches of the non-paralysed facial nerve are divided and connected to one or more sural nerve grafts which are tunnelled to the affected side of the face. Whether these nerve grafts are immediately attached to the paralysed facial nerve branches or after 9 to 12 months depends on the chosen procedure.

[[File:Babysitter procedure.jpg|thumb|left|Babysitter procedure]]If facial paralysis lasts between 6 months and 2 years, the "babysitter" procedure may be used.(Algorithm 1)<ref name="Terzis"/> During this operation both CFNGs and part of an undamaged donor nerve on the affected side are used.<ref name="Babysitter">{{cite journal |author=Terzis JK, Tzafetta K |title="Babysitter" procedure with concomitant muscle transfer in facial paralysis |journal=Plast.

This donor nerve is then attached to the distal end of the paralysed facial nerve.<ref name="Faria"/> A free muscle transplant is sometimes indicated after the "babysitter" procedure has been performed, depending on the continuity of the injured facial nerve. In other words, if there is contraction of the mimetic muscle during an [[electromyogram]].<ref name="Babysitter"/> After a denervation time of approximately more than 2 years, [[atrophy]] of the mimetic muscles is permanent.<ref name="Faria"/> In these cases a free muscle transfer is always performed in combination with a CFNG.<ref name="Terzis"/>

[[File:Motor donor nerve.jpg|thumb|right|Motor donor nerve]]The procedure of choice for congenital facial paralysis is either CFNG or motor donors, both with a free muscle transfer. (Algorithm 2) Incomplete bilateral Moebius syndrome has the same clinical features as the Moebius syndrome, however some motor function is still apparent on one side of the face.<ref name="Bianchi"/> This incomplete syndrome is reanimated with the use of the CFNG and free muscle transfer. The cross facial nerve graft comes from the side with some motor function of the facial nerve. However it first has to be investigated if the motor function of the nerve is strong enough to be separated.<ref name="Terzis"/> A free muscle transfer is always used on the paralysed side, as the muscle is a congenital atrophic muscle. Complete bilateral Moebius syndrome is treated with motor donor nerves on both sides.<ref name="Terzis"/><ref name="Bianchi"/> Optional motor donor nerves are: the masseteric nerve, [[accessory nerve]] or hypoglossal nerve. In rare cases when these nerves are also affected, [[cervical nerve]] branches can be used.<ref name="Terzis"/> The use of a free muscle transfer is again indicated.<ref name="Bianchi"/> The nerve that initially innervated the free muscle transfer is then connected to the provided branches of the motor donor nerve. In Moebius-like syndrome the CFNG is performed, as the facial nerve on the affected side does not have a strong enough motor function. A free muscle transfer is also used, due to the atrophic muscle.<ref name="Terzis"/><ref name="Bianchi"/>

==Surgical procedures==

Based on the preference of the surgeon, the [[gracilis muscle]], [[latissimus dorsi muscle]], or [[pectoralis minor muscle]] are used as free neurovascular grafts. The gracilis muscle is mostly used free neurovascular muscle, because it has a reliable anatomy and is relatively simple to harvest.<ref name="Obrien">{{cite journal |author=O'Brien BM, Pederson WC, Khazanchi RK, Morrison WA, MacLeod AM, Kumar V |title=Results of management of facial palsy with microvascular free-muscle transfer |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=12–22; discussion 23–4 |year=1990 |month=July |pmid=2359779 |doi=10.1097/00006534-199007000-00002}}</ref> In addition, it can be trimmed for the correct size and volume<ref name="Obrien"/> with preservation of superior contraction qualities compared to bipennate muscles, because the gracilis is a parallel-fibered or strap muscle.<ref name="Harii">{{cite journal |author=Harii K, Asato H, Yoshimura K, Sugawara Y, Nakatsuka T, Ueda K |title=One-stage transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle for reanimation of a paralyzed face: a new alternative |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=941–51 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9734407 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=102&issue=4&spage=941 |doi=10.1097/00006534-199809040-00001}}</ref> Another advantage is the possibility for simultaneous dissection by a second team while the first team is preparing the face for the free muscle transplant.
Another option for a free muscle transfer is the latissimus dorsi muscle. A disadvantage is that it can only be harvested with the patient in lateral decubitus or prone position. Therefore the patient has to be turned during the operation. Advantages of the latissimus dorsi muscle are its reliable anatomy and relatively simple dissection. Analogue to the gracilis muscle, this muscle can be trimmed to the correct size and volume. The latissimus dorsi muscle is also a parallel-fibered muscle.<ref name="Harii"/> Its long neurovascular bundle makes a one-stage facial reanimation without a CFNG possible. By using the long [[thoracodorsal nerve]] of the latissimus dorsi muscle, direct coaptation to the facial nerve on the other side can be performed.<ref name="Harii"/>

The third option is the pectoralis minor muscle, which is mainly used in children. Advantages of this muscle are its relatively small size and flat and fan-like shape, obviating the need for trimming without bulkiness as a result.<ref name="Mureau"/> In addition, the pectoralis minor muscle has a muscle fibre orientation that is much alike with the facial muscles.<ref name="Harii"/> However, as dissection of this muscle is rather difficult and the neurovascular anatomy is variable, nowadays surgeons tend to use it less frequently. Furthermore, the pectoralis minor muscle is not a parallel-fibered muscle, and it is oversized in adults.<ref name="Mureau"/>

During a one-stage or two-stage CFNG procedure, one or more non-affected facial nerve branches are used for reinnervation of the paralysed side. In the one stage procedure a free muscle transplant with a latissimus dorsi graft or a nerve graft (using the [[sural nerve]] or [[saphenous nerve]]) can be used. The latissimus dorsi graft is used because of its long thoracodorsal nerve. Therefore it can be coapted directly to the normal functioning facial nerve.<ref name="Harii"/> The one stage CFNG, implies an end-to-side coaptation of the sural or saphenous nerve to the distal end of the affected facial nerve.<ref name="Cerio" /> In the two-stage procedure, an incision in front of the ear is made on the non-paralysed side. Upon electrical stimulation, the nerve which produces the best contraction of the zygomatic muscles (and so the appearance of a smile) is selected.<ref name="Faria"/> This branch is then sectioned. The sural or saphenous nerve as cross facial nerve graft is coapted to this unaffected branch of the facial nerve and tunnelled across the face to the paralysed side through a subcutaneous tunnel.<ref name="Babysitter"/> The end of the graft is positioned in front of the [[tragus]] (cartilage in front of the ear) on the paralysed side. Nine to twelve months is needed for axonal regeneration in the cross facial nerve graft, because the result of damaged nerve tissue is loss of structure and axonal function. Degeneration appears distally in the paralysed facial nerve but this takes time, this process is called [[Wallerian degeneration]]. During the second stage end-to-side or end-to-end nerve coaptation to the proximal end of the paralysed facial nerve is performed with a microscope.<ref name="Faria"/> And a free muscle transplant is placed, if indicated.

Likewise the babysitter procedure uses the CFNG, in combination with the masseteric or hypoglossal nerve. In the 'babysitter' procedure, the hypoglossal nerve or masseteric nerve on the affected side is identified. This donor nerve is then attached to the distal end of the paralysed facial nerve.<ref name="Faria"/> Techniques for donor nerve transfers are transposition of the entire donor nerve, partial transposition by splitting the donor nerve longitudinally<ref name="Terzis"/> or indirect hypoglossal- or masseteric-facial anatomosis using a 'jump' interposition graft.<ref name="Tate"/> This usually is the [[great auricular nerve]] or sural nerve. These hypoglossal- or masseteric-facial nerve [[anastomosis]] using a 'jump' interposition graft can be used to directly reinnervate the paralysed facial muscles or as a babysitter procedure. The goal of the latter is only to achieve fast reinnervation of the mimetic muscle to prevent irreversible atrophy. Simultaneously one or more CFNGs are performed to eventually reinnervate the mimetic muscles, again as a one- or two-stage procedure,<ref name="Watanabe">{{cite journal |author=Watanabe Y, Akizuki T, Ozawa T, Yoshimura K, Agawa K, Ota T |title=Dual innervation method using one-stage reconstruction with free latissimus dorsi muscle transfer for re-animation of established facial paralysis: simultaneous reinnervation of the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve and the contralateral facial nerve to improve the quality of smile and emotional facial expressions |journal=J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=1589–97 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19010754 |doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2008.07.025 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1748-6815(08)00902-9}}</ref> depending on the choice for the free muscle transfer graft. If a two-stage procedure is performed, the CFNGs are connected to the distal branches of the paralysed facial nerve during the second stage 9 to 12 months later. The donor nerve can be left intact. If a free muscle transfer is indicated, this is also performed in the second stage of the procedure to augment the partially reinnervated mimic muscles by the hypoglossal nerve.<ref name="Babysitter"/>

In case of longstanding facial paralysis with irreversible muscle atrophy and unavailability of a suitable donor facial nerve, a free muscle graft is indicated for smile restoration, which has to be reinnervated by another donor nerve (usually the masseteric nerve) in an end-to-end fashion. Through an incision in front of the ear, the cheek flap is elevated below the underlying layer of fat. Here the nerve stimulator can be used in identifying the donor motor nerve to the masseter muscle. Once the nerve is identified, it is dissected from its connections and traced into the muscle to free as much length as possible.<ref name="Terzis"/>

==Results==

All procedures in general show an improvement of symmetry of smile and patient satisfaction, although time of recovery differs between different approaches. Primary neurorrhaphy provides the best possible outcome, as the anatomy and function of the damaged facial nerve is restored.<ref name="Mureau"/><ref name="Tate"/> After primary neurorrhaphy of the facial nerve mean recovery time typically is 6 to 12 months.<ref name="Shindo"/> The contraction amplitude after using a CFNG is usually not very powerful, but it results in a relatively spontaneous smile because the contralateral healthy facial nucleus controls the movements.<ref name="Manktelow">{{cite journal |author=Manktelow RT, Tomat LR, Zuker RM, Chang M |title=Smile reconstruction in adults with free muscle transfer innervated by the masseter motor nerve: effectiveness and cerebral adaptation |journal=Plast.

True spontaneity of a smile will not occur at the same rate in all dynamic smile reconstructions. A spontaneous smile is smiling without consciously thinking about it.<ref name="Manktelow"/> The primary neurorrhaphy and free muscle transfer are the only options to restore a true spontaneous smile.<ref name="Mureau"/><ref name="Watanabe"/> Although the masseteric nerve transfer provides a strong smile within the range of normal, it never becomes truly spontaneous and emotional.<ref name="Manktelow"/> But with practice, the majority of patients can provide a spontaneous smile some of the time<ref name="Manktelow"/> due to the plasticity of the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref name="Watanabe"/> Effective rehabilitation can also prevent biting whilst smiling, when using the masseteric nerve as nerve transfer.<ref name="Manktelow"/>

==Complications==

There are several complications, however, most patients find them less invalidating than the inability to smile.<ref name="Manktelow"/> General postoperative complications are infection of the muscle donor site,<ref name="Takushima"/> facial [[abscess]], [[hypertrophic scars]],<ref name="Bianchi"/> [[hematoma]],<ref name="Takushima"/> and swelling of the face or muscle donor site.<ref name="Manktelow"/> In some cases of incomplete facial paralysis, the procedure had a decline in function as a result. However, this improved after only a few months.<ref name="Takushima"/> Almost all procedures show [[synkinesis]], meaning involuntary movements appear during the voluntary movements. In primary neurorrhapy, with or without an interposition graft, perineural [[fibrosis]] is a common complication.<ref name="Tate"/> With the use of the CFNG there is a risk of sensory deficits in the lower part of the leg, due to the sural or sapheneous nerve graft.<ref name="Terzis"/> A complication seen with the use of the masseteric nerve is the inability to chew without the appearance of a smile.<ref name="Manktelow"/> The hypoglossal nerve as a donor nerve can induce tongue atrophy due to denervation.<ref name="Faria"/>
