'''Jacobsen Syndrome''', also known as '''11q deletion disorder''', is a rare [[congenital disorder]] resulting from deletion of a terminal region of [[chromosome 11]] that includes band 11q24.1. It can cause [[intellectual disabilities]], a distinctive facial appearance, and a variety of physical problems including [[heart]] defects and a [[haemophilia|bleeding disorder]]. The syndrome was first identified by [[Danish people|Danish]] physician Petra Jacobsen,<ref name="pmid4134631">{{cite journal |author=Jacobsen P, Hauge M, Henningsen K, Hobolth N, Mikkelsen M, Philip J |title=An (11;21) translocation in four generations with chromosome 11 abnormalities in the offspring. A clinical, cytogenetical, and gene marker study |journal=Hum. Hered. |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=568â€“85 |year=1973 |pmid=4134631 |doi= 10.1159/000152624|url=}}</ref> and is believed to occur in approximately 1 out of every 100,000 births.

==Possible characteristics==
*Heart defects
*Mild to severe intellectual disabilities
*Low-platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]])
*Facial/skeletal ([[dysplasia]])
*Wide-set eyes caused by [[trigonocephaly]]
*Folding of the skin near the eye ([[epicanthus]])
*Short, upturned nose (anteverted nostrils)
*Thin lips that curve inward
*Displaced receding chin ([[retrognathia]])
*Low-set, misshapen ears
*Permanent upward curvature of the pinkie and ring fingers ([[camptodactyly]])
*Large great toes/[[hammer toe|Hammer toes]]


In addition, patients tend to be shorter than average and have poor [[psychomotor]] skills.

The majority of Jacobsen syndrome cases are not familial in nature, resulting from a spontaneous [[mutation]] occurring in a single parental [[gamete]]. However, some instances of familial disease resulting from local chromosome fragility or an [[chromosomal translocation|unbalanced translocation]] have been described.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
