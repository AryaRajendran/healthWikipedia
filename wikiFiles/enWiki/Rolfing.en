'''Rolfing''' is a therapy system created by the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration (also referred to as "RISI"),<ref name="website">http://www.rolf.org{{full|date=April 2013}}{{psc|date=April 2013}}</ref> founded by [[Ida Pauline Rolf]] in 1971.<ref name="zenpioneer">{{cite book |last=Stirling |first=Isabel |title=Zen Pioneer: The Life & Works of Ruth Fuller Sasaki |year=2006 |publisher=Shoemaker & Hoard |isbn=978-1-59376-110-3 |page=8}}</ref> The Institute states that Rolfing is a "holistic system of soft tissue manipulation and movement education that organize(s) the whole body in [[gravity]]".<ref>http://www.rolf.org/about/index.htm{{full|date=April 2013}}{{psc|date=April 2013}}</ref> Manipulation of the muscle [[fasciae]] is believed to yield therapeutic benefits, including that clients stand straighter, gain height and move better, through the correction of soft tissue fixations or [[dystonia]]. A review found that evidence for clinical effectiveness and hypothesized mechanisms of Rolfing is severely limited by small sample sizes and absence of control arms, and that further research is needed,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21992437 |year=2011 |last1=Jacobson |first1=E |title=Structural integration, an alternative method of manual therapy and sensorimotor education |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=891–9 |doi=10.1089/acm.2010.0258 |pmc=3198617 |journal=Journal of alternative and complementary medicine}}</ref> though controlled trials found that a single Rolfing session significantly decreases standing pelvic tilt angle,<ref name="Cite PMID|3420170">{{cite journal |pmid=3420170 |year=1988 |last1=Cottingham |first1=JT |last2=Porges |first2=SW |last3=Richmond |first3=K |title=Shifts in pelvic inclination angle and parasympathetic tone produced by Rolfing soft tissue manipulation |volume=68 |issue=9 |pages=1364–70 |journal=Physical therapy}}</ref> and that Rolfing caused a lasting decrease in state anxiety when compared to the control group.<ref name="Cite PMID|457892">{{cite journal |pmid=457892 |year=1979 |last1=Weinberg |first1=RS |last2=Hunt |first2=VV |title=Effects of structural integration on state-trait anxiety |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=319–22 |journal=Journal of clinical psychology}}</ref> Only practitioners certified by RISI can use the title "Rolfer," or practice "Rolfing," due to service mark ownership.

==History==
Ida Pauline Rolf began developing her system in New York in the 1930s with the main goal of organizing the human structure in relation to gravity in order to help the chronically disabled unable to find help elsewhere.<ref>http://www.rolfguild.org/idarolf.html{{full|date=April 2013}}{{psc|date=April 2013}}</ref> Her method, involving a programme of deep-tissue massages, was originally called "Postural Release" and later "Structural Integration" but became known as "Rolfing". In 1971 Rolf founded the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration.<ref>http://kepler.sos.ca.gov{{full|date=April 2013}} Search for "Rolf Institute"</ref>

==Theory and practice==
{{Manipulative methods}}
[[Skeletal striated muscle|Skeletal muscles]] often work in opposing pairs called the [[Agonist (muscle)|"agonist"]] and the [[Antagonist (muscle)|"antagonist"]], the one [[Muscle contraction|contracting]] while the other relaxes. Rolf theorized that "bound up" [[fascia]]e (connective tissues) often restrict opposing muscles from functioning in concert. She aimed to separate  the fibers of bound up fasciae manually to loosen them and allow effective movement.

Rolfers often prescribe a sequence of ten sessions to "balance and optimize both the structure (shape) and function (movement) of the entire body."<ref name="rolf.org">"What is the Rolfing Ten Series?" Rolf Institute of Structural Integration, FAQ number 4 [http://www.rolf.org/about/faq.htm#4]{{psc|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref name=Rolfp15>Rolf, I: ''Reestablishing the Natural Alignment and Structural Integration of the Human Body for Vitality and Well-Being'', p15, ISBN 0-89281-335-0{{psc|date=April 2013}}</ref> The theory is that "only by bringing peace 'from the ground up' can problems higher in the body be 'understood'".<ref name=Rolfp45>Rolf, I: ''Reestablishing the Natural Alignment and Structural Integration of the Human Body for Vitality and Well-Being'', p45, ISBN 0-89281-335-0{{psc|date=April 2013}}</ref>

A client generally lies down and is guided through specific movements during a Rolfing Structural Integration session. The Rolfer manipulates the fascia until it can operate in conjunction with the muscles in a "normal" fashion.<ref name=Rolfp15/> This takes place over a course of ten 60- to 90-minute sessions, with a specific goal for each session and an overall goal of cumulative results.<ref name="rolf.org"/> Some clients find Rolfing painful but it has evolved over the decades into a far more gentle practice than it was in its early days.<ref>"Does Rolfing Hurt?" Rolf Institute of Structural Integration, FAQ number 6 [http://www.rolf.org/about/faq.htm#6]</ref> On ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2007 [[Mehmet Oz]] likened Rolfing to having someone do [[yoga]] for you.<ref name="AUSTIN CONSIDINE">{{cite news | last=  CONSIDINE| first=  AUSTIN | url=  http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/fashion/07rolfing.html?src=me&ref=general| title=  Rolfing, Excruciatingly Helpful| publisher=  [[New York Times]]| date=  6 October 2010| accessdate= 6 October 2010}}</ref>

==Evidence base==
Rolfing Structural Integration is generally regarded as safe.<ref name="rol"/> However, because it involves deep tissue manipulation, pregnant women and people with skeletal, vascular, or clot disorders should consult a health care provider before undertaking Rolfing sessions.<ref name="rol"/> Rolfing practitioners have suggested its use for a wide variety of medical conditions.<ref name="rol">[http://intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/34968/362156.html?d=dmtContent Rolfing Structural Integration] September 26, 2005</ref> 
According to a 2004 [[scientific review]], [[peer review]]ed research on Rolfing is limited, lacking controlled [[clinical trial]]s: "there is no evidence-based literature to support Rolfing in any specific disease group."<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2004.03.008 |title=Rolfing |year=2004 |last1=Jones |first1=Tracey A. |journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=799–809, vi |pmid=15458753}}</ref> However, controlled trials found that a single Rolfing session significantly decreases standing pelvic tilt angle,<ref name="Cite PMID|3420170"/> and that Rolfing caused a lasting decrease in state anxiety when compared to the control group.<ref name="Cite PMID|457892"/>

The overall concept of fascia limiting and permitting functionality is receiving more investigation. In late 2007 the first "Fascia Research Congress" was held and attracted attention from researchers and clinicians.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.318.5854.1234 |title=BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH: Cell Biology Meets Rolfing |year=2007 |last1=Grimm |first1=D. |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5854 |pages=1234–5 |pmid=18033859}}</ref><ref>"First International Fascia Research Congress: Basic Science and Implications for Conventional and Complementary Health Care," retrieved 1-29-09 [http://www.fasciacongress.org/2007/]{{psc|date=April 2013}}</ref>

Within the Structural Integration community, Robert Schleip questions Rolf's emphasis on the plasticity of [[fascia]]e, and suggests that successes may have more to do with the reduction of high [[muscle tonus]] and other physiological effects that may as easily be elicited by the stimulation of mechano-sensory receptors in the fascial tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1360-8592(02)00067-0 |title=Fascial plasticity – a new neurobiological explanation: Part 1 |year=2003 |last1=Schleip |first1=Robert |journal=Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies |volume=7 |pages=11}}</ref>
