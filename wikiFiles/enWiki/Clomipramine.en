'''Clomipramine''' (trademarked as '''Anafranil''') is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA). It was developed in the 1960s by the Swiss drug manufacturer Geigy (now known as [[Novartis]]) and has been in clinical use worldwide ever since.

Clomipramine had been used experimentally to reduce relapses in cocaine addicts, and to repair [[neurotransmitter]] damage caused by cocaine; however, further studies are needed in this area. Clomipramine has also been used experimentally to treat [[dogs]] with severe anxiety disorders (separation anxiety, etc.), [[OCD]], or [[cognitive dysfunction syndrome]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

It may take two to three weeks before the full effects of this medication are noticed in most indications and two months or more in OCD.

In a trial involving Prozac, Luvox, and Zoloft [[SSRIs]] to test their relative efficacies in treating OCD, clomipramine proved to be the most effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greist|first=JH|title=Efficacy and tolerability of serotonin transport inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder. A meta-analysis|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=1995|month=Jan|volume=1|series=52|pages=53–60|pmid=7811162|accessdate=5 April 2012|issue=1}}</ref>

Along with SSRIs, clomipramine is a frequently prescribed drug for the treatment of OCD.  As is typical with the older tricyclic antidepressants (the tertiary amines), it has more side effects than SSRIs, so some authorities regard it as a second-line treatment to be used if treatment with SSRIs fails.  However, disregarding side effects, it may be slightly more effective in combating the symptoms of OCD.  It is not commonly used for treating depression, and usually another tricyclic (or drug from a different class) would be used. Clomipramine and the SSRIs (specifically [[paroxetine]]) have also been used to treat premature ejaculation.

== Contraindications ==

* Concomitant therapy with an (irreversible) [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitor]] (e.g. [[tranylcypromine]], [[phenelzine]])
* Acute intoxication with central depressants (alcohol, psychoactive drugs, narcotics)
* States of confusion (caution), absolutely contraindicated in patients with coma and [[delirium tremens]]
* Patients with severe agitation or anxiety (give sedative drugs concomitantly)
* Hypersensitivity/allergy against clomipramine or other related tricyclic compounds
* Hypertrophy of the prostate with or without [[urinary retention|urine retention]] (difficulty in urinating)
* Pre-existing [[glaucoma|closed angle glaucoma]]
* Epilepsy and other conditions which lower the seizure threshold ([[alcohol withdrawal]], active brain tumors)
* Serious liver disease (elimination is decreased), if clomipramine is given consider dose reduction
* Serious kidney disease (elimination is decreased), if clomipramine is given consider dose reduction
* Severe [[hypotension]], shock, serious cardiovascular dysfunction (postinfarctous states, heart insufficience, arrhythmias), avoid high oral doses or injections/infusions
* Pre-existing bone marrow depression ([[leukopenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[anemia]], [[pancytopenia]]), can be worsened by clomipramine
* [[Hyperthyroidism]] (overfunction of the thyroid gland) makes the patient more sensitive to side effects of clomipramine. Cautious doses should be used and the overfunction should be treated.
* Caution should be exerted when treating pediatric patients under 18 years of age

== Chemistry ==

Clomipramine is the 3-[[chloro|chlorinated]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[imipramine]].

== Pharmacology ==

Clomipramine is a [[reuptake inhibitor|blocker]] of the following [[membrane transport protein|transporter]]s:<ref name="pmid11454918">{{cite journal | author = Millan MJ, Gobert A, Lejeune F, ''et al.'' | title = S33005, a novel ligand at both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters: I.

In addition clomipramine's active [[metabolite]] desmethylclomipramine is known to display the following affinity:

All affinities listed were assayed using [[human]] materials except those for 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> which are for mouse/rat tissues due to human values being unavailable.<ref name="pmid11454918"/><ref name="pmid7680751"/><ref name="pmid8397408" /><ref name="pmid9686407" /> Though it is unclear whether it has ever been screened, clomipramine may also act on [[sigma receptor]]s and [[calcium channel|calcium]], [[potassium channel|potassium]], and [[sodium channel]]s similarly to other TCAs.

Clomipramine possesses the highest ''[[in vitro]]'' [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the SERT of any of the TCAs. While its affinities for sites other than SERT are almost all over 100-fold lower in comparison, clomipramine is used at relatively high doses (25–300&nbsp;mg) similar to those employed with other TCAs; hence, at clinical doses clomipramine is not a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) but instead a very, very strong [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] with additional [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]], [[antiserotonergic]], [[antiadrenergic]], [[antidopaminergic]], [[antihistamine]], and [[anticholinergic]] properties and associated [[side effect]]s. Clomipramine's affinity for the DAT is very low/negligible and it therefore lacks any significant [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] actions.

It should also be noted that clomipramine's active [[metabolite]] desmethylclomipramine is a much more potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than clomipramine itself. As a result, ''[[in vivo]]'' clomipramine is more balanced of a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]], though with preferential serotonergic actions nonetheless.

== Side effects ==

Clomipramine may have a broad range of side effects:

* Central nervous system: Often, fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, confusion, agitation, [[insomnia]], nightmares, increased anxiety, seizures (0.5% to 2%, see below), rarely [[hypomania]] or induction of [[schizophrenia]] (immediate termination of therapy required), and [[Extrapyramidal system|extrapyramidal]] side effects ([[Parkinsonism|pseudoparkinsonism]], [[dyskinesia]], rarely [[tardive dyskinesia]]) are noted.
* [[Anticholinergic]] side effects in different grades of severity are quite common: dry mouth, constipation, rarely [[ileus]] (paralysis of the large intestine, life-threatening), difficulties in urinating, sweating, precipitation of glaucoma (may lead to permanent eye-damage or even blindness, if untreated). The incidence of dental [[caries]] may be increased due to dry mouth.
* [[adrenergic|Antiadrenergic]] side effects occur very frequently due to strong central and peripheral blockage of alpha receptors: hypotension, postural collapse (when patient is rising too fast from lying or sitting position to standing), arrhythmias ([[sinus tachycardia]], [[bradycardia]], AV block, rarely other forms of cardiac problems). Pre-existing heart insufficiency can be worsened.

Most of these side effects are dose related and/or tolerance will develop with continued use.

* Allergic/toxic: skin reactions and [[photosensitivity]] with increased frequency of sunburns are seen in a few percentage of cases. Rarely liver damage of the cholostatic type, [[hepatitis]], and leukopenia or other forms of blood dyskrasia are seen, also severe acute allergy including difficulties in breathing, skin reaction, chest pain etc.
* Other side effects may include [[heartburn]], weight loss, nausea and [[bruxism]] (teeth-grinding while asleep), the last due to the strong inhibition of reuptake of [[serotonin]].
* The drug often causes sexual problems in men (e.g. impotence, ejaculation difficulties).<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/risque/aphrodisiacs/yawn.asp "Yin, Yang and Yawn"] - Snopes article on Clomipramine</ref>
* In a few patients (both male and female), it can cause inadvertent orgasms when yawning.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-07/news/ls-217_1_side-effect "Depression Drug's Side Effect Has Users Aroused"] - LA Times article on Clomipramine</ref>

Clomipramine has the disadvantage of a higher incidence of [[seizures]] than seen with other TCAs (up to a dose of 250&nbsp;mg daily in 0.5%, more than 300&nbsp;mg in 2%).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Drug abuse and addiction ==
 
Clomipramine has no known potential for addiction or abuse; it is not known to be a controlled substance in any jurisdiction where it is available except in Mexico. 

Although clomipramine is not a controlled substance, it can cause physical dependence.  Abrupt discontinuation of treatment can cause [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]], symptoms of which include agitation, fatigue, nausea, headaches, insomnia, mania and rebound of depression or anxiety.  This unpleasant, but temporary and nonlethal, condition can be successfully averted if the daily dose of clomipramine is gradually reduced by approximately 25% each week.  If immediate discontinuation is required for medical reasons, a short-term (up to four weeks, ''pro re nata'') course of any [[minor tranquilizer]] will generally minimize any withdrawal symptoms, although only the [[benzodiazepines]] are commonly used in the United Kingdom for this indication.

== Other reasons for caution ==

Depression itself can lead to thoughts or attempts of suicide. Emotionally unstable patients or those with suicidal thoughts should receive the smallest amount of the drug feasible. Often cotreatment with a sedative drug (e.g. a benzodiazepine or [[chlorprothixene]]) is necessary until remission of depression is evident.

Caution is advised when using clomipramine in the elderly, because they may be more sensitive to the effects of the drug (e.g., confusion may occur or worsen). Clomipramine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is excreted into breast milk. The effects on the infant are not known at this time.

== Drug interactions ==

Clomipramine shows a number of clinical significant interactions, either due to central depressant or stimulant activity of the other drug or due to interference of the other drug with the metabolization and elimination of clomipramine or vice versa. Some examples are:

* MAO inhibitors (e.g., [[furazolidone]], [[linezolid]], [[phenelzine]], [[selegiline]], [[tranylcypromine]]): severe reactions including central excitation, [[hypertensive crisis]], bizarre behaviour, psychosis, seizures, coma and death are possible. [[Serotonin syndrome]] is likely.
* Central stimulants: Potentially dangerous central excitation with agitation and anxiety may be encountered.
* [[SSRI]] type antidepressants (e.g. [[fluoxetine]]): Side effects of clomipramine are increased. May cause Serotonin syndrome.
* Drugs with central depressant activity (tranquilizers, alcohol, narcotics): Increased central depression (dizziness, drowsiness etc.) is frequently noted.
* Antihypertensive drugs: The risk of hypotension, collapse, and tachycardia is increased.
* Interactions with [[Over-the-counter drug|OTC]] medications against colds and sleeping aids with [[diphenhydramine]], [[doxylamine]] and [[St. John's wort]] may occur.

== Dosage ==

For depression, the normal adult dose starts at 10 mg a day. This might be increased to 30-150 mg a day, and to no more than 250 mg.  The normal elderly dose for depression also starts at 10 mg, which your doctor may increase to 30 - 75 mg a day.

For phobias and obsessive states, adults will usually be started on 25 mg a day, and the elderly on 10 mg a day. Both of these may be slowly increased if needed.

For cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, the usual starting does for adults (including the elderly) is 10 mg a day, which may be increased to up to 75 mg a day.

In hospitalized patients initial [[intramuscular]] injections and very slow [[intravenous]] infusions can be used, but the risk of hypotension and seizures may be increased with parenteral drug use. The advantage is that the onset of action may be faster.

Usually, clomipramine needs some weeks to reach its maximum effects and needs to be given as long-term treatment, sometimes for life (narcolepsy).  In cases of narcolepsy, antidepressant compounds like clomipramine are used to manage symptoms of cataplexy, which usually manifests as [[sleep paralysis]] (the inability to move skeletal muscles upon waking from [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] sleep).  In most patients with narcolepsy, clomipramine monotherapy is not sufficient to control non-cataleptic symptoms, such as excessive daytime fatigue and sleep attacks.  In these cases, a commonly used CNS stimulant medication (e.g. [[modafinil]], [[dextroamphetamine]] or [[methylphenidate]]) is used in lieu of, or in addition to, a tricyclic antidepressant like clomipramine.  Concomitant use of a psychostimulant medication and an antidepressant is common in narcolepsy.  Other antidepressants used to help control cataplexy include [[desipramine]], [[protriptyline]] and [[venlafaxine]].

== Overdose ==

{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

If overdose is suspected, medical authorities recommend contacting the local [[poison control center]] or [[emergency room]]/[[Emergency department|A&E]] immediately. Other worldwide poison centers can be found at the [http://www.who.int/ipcs/poisons/centre/directory/en/ World directory of poison centers].

Ten out of 12 patients presenting with manifest clomipramine overdose survived with appropriate treatment. These 10 patients took clomipramine doses of up to 5&nbsp;grams. The two patients who died ingested 5.75 and 7&nbsp;grams, respectively. Outside the US one patient died who took only 0.75&nbsp;grams. Lethal doses may be lower, if other drugs have been taken in an overdose, too, particularly [[central nervous system]] depressants.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants.

== Augmenting Clomipramine with Fluvoxamine ==
Clomipramine is typically metabolized to desmethyl-clomipramine by [[Cytochrome P450|CYP450 1A2]]. Desmethyl-clomipramine is an [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRI]]. While combining [[SSRIs]] and [[tricyclic antidepressants]] is risky, [[fluvoxamine]], an inhibitor of CYP450 1A2, could be added to clomipramine to preserve more of the molecule in the original state, which is more serotonergic, thus creating a powerful synergy.<ref>Stahl, S. Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: The Prescriber's Guide. Cambridge University Press. New York, NY, 2009. pp.94</ref>

== Veterinary uses ==

Clomipramine is widely used for the treatment of disturbed behaviour of dogs, cats, and horses.  Marketed by Novartis for veterinary use under the name 'Clomicalm', clomipramine is given orally and has different licensed uses in different countries.

In the US, clomipramine is currently only licensed to treat separation anxiety in dogs.<ref>http://www.clomicalm.novartis.us/</ref>  However it is often prescribed in off-label use for many other conditions including other anxiety disorders, [[phobias]] ([[noise phobia in dogs]], et al.), obsessive-compulsive disorders ([[tail chasing]], excessive grooming, et al.), and "mood" problems.  It has also been used in older dogs suffering from [[canine cognitive dysfunction]] (CCD) or [[canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome]] (CDS or CCDS), though it is important to note that unlike [[Anipryl]] clomipramine is not thought to reverse the condition by increasing dopamine levels in the brain to improve function; it only "treats the symptoms" so to speak and only those related to anxiety to make the dog feel more relaxed and calmer.

The UK license is restricted to the drug being used:

{{quote|"As an aid in the treatment of separation-related disorders in dogs manifested by destruction and inappropriate elimination (defecation and urination) and only in combination with behavioural modification techniques."}}

[[File:Canine lick granuloma.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lick granuloma]] (also known as [[acral lick dermatitis]]) from excessive licking]]
In Australia the license is broader:

{{quote|"Treatment of stereotypic behaviours (obsessive-compulsive disorders) in dogs such as [[acral lick dermatitis]], excessive grooming and tail chasing. An aid in the treatment of anxiety disorders in dogs such as destructiveness, excessive vocalisation, loss of toilet control, associated with separation anxiety. An aid in the treatment of [[urine spraying]] in desexed and female cats." |Product Information for Clomicalm, Novartis Animal Health Australasia Pty Limited}}.
Off-label use: If a drug is used outside of its license in a given country, this constitutes "off-label" use. For example, use of clomipramine in urine spraying cats would be off-label in the UK, but within the Australian license. This is important because legal restrictions on the off-label use of drugs apply nationally, and must be considered when using such drugs in a given problem in a particular species. Clomipramine has been used for cognitive dysfunction syndrome to alleviate anxiety associated with the disease; however it is not believed to manage the underlying cause of the problem.
