'''Granuloma''' is a [[medical term]] for a tiny collection of [[immune cell]]s known as [[macrophage]]s.<ref name="Muk7" /> Granulomas form when the [[immune system]] attempts to wall off substances that it perceives as foreign but is unable to eliminate. Such substances include [[infectious organism]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] as well as other materials such as [[keratin]] and [[Surgical suture|suture]] fragments.<ref name="Woodard1982">{{cite journal |author=Woodard BH, Rosenberg SI, Farnham R, Adams DO |title=Incidence and nature of primary granulomatous inflammation in surgically removed material |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119&ndash;129 |year=1982 |pmid=7102892 |doi= 10.1097/00000478-198203000-00004|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hunter DC, Logie JR |title=Suture granuloma |journal=British Journal of Surgery |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=1149&ndash;1150 |year=1988 |pmid=3208057 |doi= 10.1002/bjs.1800751140|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen KT, Kostich ND, Rosai J |title=Peritoneal foreign body granulomas to keratin in uterine adenocanthoma |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=174&ndash;177 |year=1978 |pmid=580709 |doi= |url=}}</ref> A granuloma is therefore a special type of [[inflammation]] that can occur in a wide variety of [[diseases]].<ref name="Muk7" /> The adjective '''granulomatous''' means ''characterized by granulomas''.

==Definition==
In medical practice, doctors occasionally use the term "granuloma" loosely to mean "a small nodule". Since a small [[nodule]] can represent anything from a harmless [[nevus]] to a [[malignant tumor]], this usage of the term is not very specific. Examples of the inaccurate use of the term granuloma are the lesions known as vocal cord granuloma, [[pyogenic granuloma]] and intubation granuloma, all of which are examples of [[granulation tissue]], not granulomas. "Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma" is a lesion characterized by keloid-like fibrosis in the lung, and is not granulomatous. Similarly, radiologists often use the term granuloma when they see a calcified nodule on X-ray or CT scan of the chest. They make this assumption since granulomas usually contain calcium, although the cells that form a granuloma are too tiny to be seen by a radiologist. The most accurate use of the term "granuloma" requires a [[pathologist]] to examine surgically removed and specially colored (stained) tissue under a microscope. The following is a more technical, accurate definition of a granuloma: In [[pathology]], a '''granuloma''' (classical Greek plural ''granulomata''; modern anglicized plural ''granulomas'') is '''an organized collection of macrophages.'''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams DO |title=The granulomatous inflammatory response. A review |journal=American Journal of Pathology |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=164&ndash;191 |year=1976 |pmid=937513 |doi= |pmc=2032357}}</ref><ref name="Muk7" />

[[Macrophages]] (also known as [[histiocytes]]) are the cells that define a granuloma. They often, but not invariably, fuse to form multinucleated giant cells ([[Langhans giant cell]]).<ref>{{cite book |title= Janeway's Immunobiology |authorlink=Kenneth Murphy |coauthors=Paul Travers, Mark Walport  |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science |page=372}}</ref> The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as "[[epithelioid]]". This term refers to the vague resemblance of these macrophages to epithelial cells. Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages and their cytoplasm is typically more pink when stained with [[eosin]]. These changes are thought to be a consequence of "activation" of the macrophage by the offending antigen.

The other key term in the above definition is the word "organized" that refers to a tight, ball-like formation. The macrophages in these formations are typically so tightly clustered that the borders of individual cells are difficult to appreciate. Loosely dispersed macrophages are not considered to be granulomas.

All granulomas, regardless of cause, may contain additional cells and matrix. These include [[lymphocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[multinucleated giant cells]], [[fibroblasts]] and [[collagen]] ([[fibrosis]]). The additional cells are sometimes a clue to the cause of the granuloma. For example, granulomas with numerous eosinophils may be a clue to coccidioidomycosis or allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease, and granulomas with numerous neutrophils suggest blastomycosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, aspiration pneumonia or cat-scratch disease.

In terms of the underlying cause, the difference between granulomas and other types of inflammation is that granulomas form in response to antigens that are resistant to "first-responder" inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils.  The antigen causing the formation of a granuloma is most often an infectious pathogen or a substance foreign to the body, but often the offending antigen is unknown (as in sarcoidosis).

Granulomas are seen in a wide variety of diseases, both infectious and non-infectious.<ref name="Woodard1982" /><ref name=Muk7>{{cite journal|last=Mukhopadhyay|first=S|coauthors=Farver CF, Vaszar LT, Dempsey OJ, Popper HH, Mani H, Capelozzi VL, Fukuoka J, Kerr KM, Zeren EH, Iyer VK, Tanaka T, Narde I, Nomikos A, Gumurdulu D, Arava S, Zander DS, Tazelaar HD|title=Causes of pulmonary granulomas: a retrospective study of 500 cases from seven countries|journal=J Clin Pathol|year=2012|month=Jan|volume=65|issue=1|pages=51â€“57|pmid=22011444|doi=10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200336}}</ref> Infections that are characterized by granulomas include [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[cryptococcosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]] and [[cat scratch disease]]. Examples of non-infectious granulomatous diseases are [[sarcoidosis]],  [[Crohn's disease]], [[berylliosis]], [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]], pulmonary [[rheumatoid nodules]] and aspiration of food and other particulate material into the lung.

An important feature of granulomas is whether or not they contain [[necrosis]]. Necrosis refers to dead cells that, under the microscope, appear as a mass of formless debris with no nuclei present. A related term, "caseation" (literally: turning to cheese) refers to a form of necrosis that, to the unaided eye (i.e., without a microscope), appears cheese-like ("caseous"), and is typically (but not uniquely) a feature of the granulomas of tuberculosis. The identification of necrosis in granulomas is important because granulomas with necrosis tend to have infectious causes.<ref name="Muk7" /> There are several exceptions to this general rule, but it nevertheless remains useful in day-to-day diagnostic pathology.

==Diseases characterized by granulomas==
===Tuberculosis===
The granulomas of [[tuberculosis]] tend to contain [[necrosis]] ("caseating tubercules"), but non-necrotizing granulomas may also be present. Multinucleated giant cells with nuclei arranged like a horseshoe ([[Langhans giant cell]]) are often present, but are not specific for tuberculosis. A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires identification of the causative organism by microbiologic cultures <ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA.|title=Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis  |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=669&ndash;690 |year=2010 |pmid=20441499 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667|url=}}</ref>.

===Leprosy===
In [[leprosy]], granulomas are found in the skin and tend to involve nerves. The appearance of the granulomas differs according to the precise type of leprosy.

===Schistosomiasis===
Some [[schistosome]] ova that are laid in intestinal and urinary venules backwash into the liver via the portal vein causing granuloma formation in the liver.

===Histoplasmosis===
Granulomas are seen in most forms of [[histoplasmosis]] (acute histoplasmosis, histoplasmoma, chronic histoplasmosis). ''Histoplasma'' organisms can sometimes be demonstrated within the granulomas by biopsy or microbiological cultures.<ref name="Muk7" />

===Cryptococcosis===
When ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'' infection occurs in persons whose immune systems are intact, granulomatous inflammation is typically encountered. The granulomas can be necrotizing or non-necrotizing. Using a microscope and appropriate stains, organisms can be seen within the granulomas <ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA.|title=Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis  |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=669&ndash;690 |year=2010 |pmid=20441499 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667|url=}}</ref>.

===Cat-scratch disease===
[[Cat-scratch disease]] is an infection caused by the bacterial organism ''Bartonella henselae'', typically acquired by a scratch from a kitten infected with the organism. The granulomas in this disease are found in the lymph nodes draining the site of the scratch. They are characteristically "suppurative", i.e., [[pus]] forming, containing large numbers of neutrophils. Organisms are usually difficult to find within the granulomas using methods routinely used in pathology laboratories.

===Sarcoidosis===
[[Image:Asteroid bodies high mag cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[asteroid bodies]] in [[sarcoidosis]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
[[Sarcoidosis]] is a disease of unknown cause characterized by non-necrotizing ("non-caseating") granulomas in multiple organs and body sites,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iannuzzi M, Rybicki BA, Teirstein AS |title=Sarcoidosis |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=21 |pages=2153&ndash;2165 |year=2007 |pmid=18032765 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMra071714|url=}}</ref> most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes within the chest cavity. Other common sites of involvement include the liver, spleen, skin and eyes. The granulomas of [[sarcoidosis]] are similar to the granulomas of tuberculosis and other infectious granulomatous diseases. However, in most cases of sarcoidosis, the granulomas do not contain necrosis and are surrounded by concentric scar tissue ([[fibrosis]]). Sarcoid granulomas often contain star-shaped structures termed [[asteroid bodies]] or [[lamellar]] structures termed [[Schaumann bodies]]. However, these structures are not specific for sarcoidosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA.|title=Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis  |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=669&ndash;690 |year=2010 |pmid=20441499 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667|url=}}</ref> Sarcoid granulomas can resolve spontaneously without complications or heal with residual scarring. In the lungs, this scarring can cause a condition known as [[pulmonary fibrosis]] that impairs breathing; in the heart, it can lead to rhythm disturbances, heart failure and even death.

===Crohn's disease===
[[Crohn's disease]] is an inflammatory condition of uncertain cause characterized by severe inflammation in the wall of the intestines and other parts of the abdomen. Within the inflammation in the gut wall, granulomas are often found, and are a clue to the diagnosis.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/11/teen.self.diagnosis/ "Teen diagnoses her own disease in science class"]</ref>

===Listeria monocytogenes===
[[Listeria monocytogenes]] infection in infants can cause potentially fatal disseminated granulomas, called granulomatosis infantiseptica, following in utero infection.

===Pneumocystis pneumonia===
[[Pneumocystis]] infection in the lungs is usually not associated with granulomas, but rare cases are well documented to cause granulomatous inflammation. The diagnosis is established by finding Pneumocystis yeasts within the granulomas on lung biopsies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hartel PH, Shilo K, Klassen-Fischer M, et al.|title=Granulomatous reaction to Pneumocystis jirovecii. clinicopathologic review of 20 cases  |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=730&ndash;734 |year=2010 |pmid=20414100 |doi= 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181d9f16a|url=}}</ref>

===Aspiration pneumonia===
[[Aspiration pneumonia]] is typically caused by aspiration of bacteria from the oral cavity into the lungs, and does not result in the formation of granulomas. However, granulomas may form when food particles or other particulate substances like pill fragments are aspirated into the lungs. Patients typically aspirate food because they have esophageal, gastric or neurologic problems. Intake of drugs that depress neurologic function may also lead to aspiration. The resultant granulomas are typically found around the airways (bronchioles) and are often accompanied by foreign-body-type multinucleated giant cells, acute inflammation or organizing pneumonia. The finding of food particles in lung biopsies is diagnostic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Katzenstein AL |title=Pulmonary disease due to aspiration of food and other particulate matter: a clinicopathologic study of 59 cases diagnosed on biopsy or resection specimens |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=752&ndash;759 |year=2007 |pmid=17460460 |doi= 10.1097/01.pas.0000213418.08009.f9|url=}}</ref>

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Necrotizing granulomas can develop in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]], typically manifesting as bumps in the soft tissues around the joints (so-called rheumatoid nodules) or in the lungs <ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA.|title=Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis  |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=669&ndash;690 |year=2010 |pmid=20441499 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667|url=}}</ref>.

===Granuloma annulare===
[[Granuloma annulare]] is a skin disease of unknown cause in which granulomas are found in the dermis of the skin. These granulomas typically have a central zone of mucin, which aids in the diagnosis when a skin sample is viewed under the microscope.

==Granulomas associated with vasculitis==
Certain inflammatory diseases are characterised by a combination of granulomatous inflammation and [[vasculitis]] (inflammation of the blood vessels). Both the granulomas as well as the vasculitis tend to occur in association with [[necrosis]]. Classic examples of such diseases include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (previously referred to by the eponym [[Wegener's Granulomatosis]]<ref>Falk, R.J., Gross, W.L., Guikkevin, L., et al. (2011) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegeners's): an alternative name for Wegener's granulomatosis, Ann Rheum Dis 70:704</ref>) and [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]].
