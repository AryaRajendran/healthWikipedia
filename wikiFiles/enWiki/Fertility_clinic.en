'''Fertility clinics''' are staffed medical clinics that assist couples, and sometimes individuals, who want to become [[parent]]s but for medical reasons have been unable to achieve this goal via the natural course. Clinics apply a number of diagnosis tests and sometimes very advanced medical treatments to obtain the desired [[Fertilisation|conceptions]] and [[pregnancy|pregnancies]].

==Clinic Staff==
Fertility clinics are staffed with highly trained personnel including [[Reproductive Endocrinologist]]s, [[Embryologist]]s, [[Sonographer]]s, and [[Nurse]]s.  Additional specialists from [[Acupuncture]], [[Hypnotherapy]], and [[Nutrition]] may also be part of the team.

==Diagnosis==
Fertility Clinics look to both males and females for diagnosis of fertility problems.  Diagnosis has shown that fertility problems arise 35% of the time from males, 35% from female, 20% from combined issues, and 10% from unexplained causes.<ref>Diagnosis & Treatment Section - [http://www.conceptionsrepro.com Conceptions Reproductive Associates of Colorado]</ref>  For the male, [[semen collection]] is a standard diagnostic test to ascertain problems with the [[semen quality]].  While females may undergo a multitude of tests including an ovulation analysis, x-ray of fallopian tubes and uterus, and laparoscopy.<ref>How is Infertility Diagnosed? - [http://www.asrm.org/Patients/faqs.html American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)]</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment may include ovulation induction, surgical interventions, [[intrauterine insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization]] or the use of an [[egg donor]]<ref>Clinic Services - [http://www.conceptionsrepro.com Conceptions Reproductive Associates of Colorado]</ref> or a [[sperm donor]]. They also perform [[ultrasound]]s by a sonograher and advance pregnacy testes. [[In vitro fertilisation]] is the most well known of the [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures performed at a fertility clinic.

==Comparing Clinics==
The Centers for Disease Control requires outcome data be reported to the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) which is the organization that creates these statistics.<ref>Patient Benefits - [http://www.sart.org/PatientBenefits.html Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART)]</ref>  Fertility clinics are often compared by these IVF Success Rates.  However, it's important to note that SART puts a caution at bottom of each report that reads "Patient characteristics vary among programs; therefore, these data should not be used for comparing clinics.".  A consultation with many fertility clinics is always a good option to get a more complete comparison for a patients specific situation and needs.

==In fiction==
[[Medical drama]]s set in a fertility clinic include "[[Inconceivable]]" which ran for two episodes in 2005 before being canceled, and "[[The Family Man (British TV series)|The Family Man]]", a British series in three parts. Furthermore, [[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]] is set in a clinic that offers fertility services to a large extent.
