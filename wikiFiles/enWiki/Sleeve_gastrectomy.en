'''Sleeve gastrectomy''' is a surgical [[weight loss|weight-loss]] procedure in which the [[stomach]] is reduced to about 25% of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach, following the [[Greater curvature of the stomach|major curve]]. The open edges are then attached together (often with [[surgical staple]]s) to form a sleeve or tube with a banana shape. The procedure permanently reduces the size of the stomach. The procedure is performed [[laparoscopic]]ally and is not reversible. The largest benefit of this surgery is that the missing portions of the stomache no longer produce the hormone of Ghrelin.   

== Procedure ==
Sleeve gastrectomy (also called gastric sleeve) was originally performed on extremely [[obese]] patients, with a [[body mass index]] well exceeding 50 or 60 or more, where the risk of performing a [[gastric bypass]] or [[duodenal switch]] procedure may be too large. A two-stage procedure is performed: the first is a sleeve gastrectomy, and the second is a conversion into a gastric bypass or duodenal switch. Patients usually lose a large quantity of their excess weight after the first sleeve gastrectomy procedure alone, but if weight loss ceases the second step is performed.

For patients that are obese but not extremely obese (BMI 35-40), sleeve gastrectomy alone is a suitable operation with minimum risks. The sleeve gastrectomy currently is acceptable weight loss surgery option for obese patients as a single procedure. Most surgeons prefer to use a [[Esophageal_dilatation#Types_of_dilators|bougie]] between 32 - 60 Fr with the procedure and the ideal approximate remaining size of the stomach after the procedure is about 15 mL.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845949/ | work=Canadian Journal of Surgery | title=Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: an innovative new tool in the battle against the obesity epidemic in Canada | first=Shahzeer | last=Karmali | year=2010}}</ref>
