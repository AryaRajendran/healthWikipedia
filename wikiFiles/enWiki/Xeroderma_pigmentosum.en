'''Xeroderma pigmentosum''', or XP, is an autosomal recessive [[genetic disorder]] of [[DNA repair]] in which the ability to repair damage caused by [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light is deficient.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

The most common defect in xeroderma pigmentosum is an autosomal recessive genetic defect in which [[nucleotide excision repair]] (NER) enzymes are mutated, leading to a reduction in or elimination of NER.<ref>{{cite book

If tumor suppressor genes (e.g. [[p53]]) or [[proto oncogenes]] are affected, the result may be [[cancer]]. Patients with XP are at a high risk for developing skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, for this reason.

Normally, damage to [[DNA]] in [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal cells]] occurs during exposure to UV light. The absorption of the high energy light leads to the formation of [[pyrimidine dimers]], namely [[Pyrimidine_dimers#Cyclobutane_photodimers|cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers]] and pyrimidine-6-4-pyrimidone photoproducts. In a healthy, normal human being, the damage is first excised by [[endonucleases]]. [[DNA polymerase]] then repairs the missing sequence, and [[DNA ligase|ligase]] "seals" the transaction. This process is known as nucleotide excision repair.

==Types==
There are seven complementation groups, plus one variant form:

 |Type V, XPV || || {{OMIM2|278750}} || [[POLH]] || 6p21.1-p12 || '''Xeroderma pigmentosum variant''' - these patients suffer from mutation in a gene that codes for a specialized DNA polymerase called [[DNA polymerase eta|polymerase-η (eta)]]. Polymerase-η can replicate over the damage and is needed when cells enter [[S-phase]] in the presence of a DNA-replication.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include:

*Severe [[sunburn]] when exposed to only small amounts of sunlight. These often occur during a child's first exposure to sunlight.
*Development of many [[freckle]]s at an early age
*Rough-surfaced growths ([[solar keratose]]s), and [[skin cancer]]s
*Eyes that are painfully sensitive to the sun and may easily become irritated, [[Red eye (medicine)|bloodshot]] and clouded
*[[Blister]]ing or freckling on minimum sun exposure
*Spidery [[blood vessel]]s
*Limited growth of hair on chest and legs
*[[Scaly skin]]
*[[Dry skin]]
*Irregular dark spots on the skin
*[[Corneal ulceration]]s

==Treatment==
The most obvious, and often important part of treatment, is avoiding exposure to sunlight. [[Keratoses]] can also be treated using [[cryotherapy]] or [[fluorouracil]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Prognosis==
Fewer than 40% of individuals with the disease survive beyond the age of 20. Some XP victims with less severe cases do manage to live well into their 40s.

==In popular culture==
These fictional characters have XP:
* Christopher Snow in [[Dean Koontz]]'s ''[[Moonlight Bay Trilogy]]''
* Luke in the 2002 novel ''Going Out'' by [[Scarlett Thomas]]
* In the Japanese movie ''[[Taiyou no Uta]]'' also known as ''Midnight Sun'', the main character (Kaoru Amane)
* In the [[ITV]] series ''[[Ultraviolet (TV serial)|Ultraviolet]]'', one of the humans is mistaken for a vampire because he avoids sunlight, when in fact he has XP.
* In the independent film ''[[Dark Side Of The Sun (film)|Dark Side of the Sun]]'' (1988) with [[Brad Pitt]] as the main character suffering from XP.
* In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'', the two children, Anne and Nicholas, suffer from XP.
* In the 2003 novel ''[[Second Glance]]'' by [[Jodi Picoult]], Ethan Wakeman, the 9-year-old nephew of Ross Wakeman (the main protagonist)
* The 2003 [[Angela Johnson (writer)|Angela Johnson]] novel, ''A Cool Moonlight'', centers on a girl who has XP and can never be in the sun. The family has gone to drastic measures to help make her life easier, and to make her feel like a normal 8-year-old.
* The Spanish film "[[Eskalofrío]]" or "Shiver" released in 2008 featured a main character named Santi who is ostracized as he suffers from the condition.
* The 2011 film ''[[La permission de minuit]]'' by French director [[Delphine Gleize]] centers on a teenage boy with XP.
* The 2012 documentary "[http://www.pbs.org/pov/sunkissed/ Sun Kissed]" explores the XP problem on the Navajo Indian Reservation.

* The 2013 young adult novel ''What We Saw at Night'' by [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]] tells the story of three teenagers who are suffering from this disease, go out only when dark and witness something strange one night.
