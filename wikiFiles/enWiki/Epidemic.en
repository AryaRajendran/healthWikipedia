In [[epidemiology]], an '''epidemic''' (from επί (epi), meaning "upon or above" and δήμος (demos), meaning "people") occurs when new cases of a certain [[disease]], in a given human population, and during a given period, substantially exceed what is expected based on recent experience.<ref name="Principles of Epidemiology"/>{{rp|354}}<ref name=Green>{{cite journal |author=Green MS, Swartz T, Mayshar E, Lev B, Leventhal A, Slater PE, Shemer J |title=When is an epidemic an epidemic? |journal=Isr. Med. Assoc. J. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3–6 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11802306 |doi= |url=http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar02jan-1.pdf}}</ref> Epidemiologists often consider the term [[outbreak]] to be [[synonymous]] to epidemic, but the general public typically perceives outbreaks to be more local and less serious than epidemics.<ref name=Green/><ref name="Principles of Epidemiology"/>{{rp|55, 354}}

Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by a change in the ecology of the host population (e.g. increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the parasite population or the introduction of a new parasite to a host population (by movement of parasites or hosts). Generally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to a parasite population is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded.<ref>"epidemic".

An epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a [[pandemic]].<ref name="Principles of Epidemiology">{{cite book |author= |title=Principles of Epidemiology, Second Edition |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |location=Atlanta, Georgia |year=|pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/phtn/catalog/pdf-file/Epi_course.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|55}} The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a [[baseline (medicine)|baseline]] rate of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]; epidemics for certain diseases, such as [[influenza]], are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline.<ref name=Green/> A few cases of a very rare [[disease]] may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the [[common cold]]) would not.

==Causes==
There are several changes that may occur in an [[infectious agent]] that may trigger an epidemic these include:<ref name="Principles of Epidemiology"/>{{rp|55}}
* Increased [[virulence]]
* Introduction into a novel setting
* Changes in host susceptibility to the infectious agent


An epidemic disease is not required to be [[contagious disease|contagious]],<ref name=Green/><ref name=Martin/> and the term has been applied to [[West Nile fever]]<ref name=Green/> and the [[obesity epidemic]], among others.<ref name=Martin/>

The conditions which govern the outbreak of epidemics include infected food supplies such as contaminated drinking water and the migration of populations of certain animals, such as rats or mosquitoes, which can act as disease vectors.  Certain epidemics occur at certain seasons: for example, whooping-cough occurs in spring, whereas measles produces two epidemics, one in winter and one in March. Influenza, the common cold, and other infections of the upper respiratory tract, such as sore throat, occur predominantly in the winter.
There is another variation, both as regards the number of persons affected and the number who die in successive epidemics: the severity of successive epidemics rises and falls over periods of five or ten years. <ref>"Epidemic."

==Types==
===Common source outbreak===
In a common source outbreak, the affected individuals had an exposure to a common agent. If the exposure is singular and all of the affected individuals develop the disease over a single exposure and incubation course, it can be termed a point source outbreak. If the exposure was continuous or variable, it can be termed a continuous outbreak or intermittent outbreak, respectively.<ref name="Principles of Epidemiology"/>{{rp|56}}

===Propagated outbreak===
In a propagated outbreak, the disease spreads person-to-person. Affected individuals may become independent reservoirs leading to further exposures.<ref name="Principles of Epidemiology"/>{{rp|56}}

Many epidemics will have characteristics of both common source and propagated outbreaks. For example, secondary person-to-person spread may occur after a common source exposure or an environmental vectors may spread a [[zoonotic]] diseases agent.<ref name="Principles of Epidemiology"/>{{rp|56-58}}

==Transmission==
*Airborne transmission: Spread of infection by droplet nuclei or dust through the air. Without the intervention of winds or drafts the distance over which airborne infection takes place is short, say 10 to 20 feet.

*Arthropod transmission: By insect, either mechanically via a contaminated proboscis or feet, or biologically when there is growth or replication of the organism in the arthropod.

*Biological transmission: Involving a biological process, e.g. passing a stage of development of the infecting agent in an intermediate host. Opposite to mechanical transmission.

*Colostral transmission: A form of vertical transmission via successive generations.

*Contact transmission: The disease agent is transferred directly by biting, sucking, chewing or indirectly by inhalation of droplets, drinking of contaminated water, traveling in contaminated vehicles.

*Cyclopropagative transmission: The agent undergoes both development and multiplication in the transmitting vehicle.

*Developmental transmission: The agent undergoes some development in the transmission vehicle.

*Fecal-oral transmission: The infectious agent is shed by the infected host in feces and acquired by the susceptible host through ingestion of contamined material.

*Horizontal transmission: Lateral spread to others in the same group and at the same time; spread to contemporaries.

*Mechanical transmission: The transmitter is not infected in that tissues are not invaded and the agent does not multiply.

*Propagative transmission: The agent multiplies in the transmission vehicle.

*Vertical transmission: From one generation to the next, perhaps transovarially or by intrauterine infection of the fetus. Some retroviruses are transmitted in the germ line, i.e. their genetic material is integrated into the DNA of either the ovum or sperm.

==Etymology==
The term epidemic derives from a term first attributed to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', which later took its medical meaning from a treatise by [[Hippocrates]], ''[[Epidemics (Hippocrates)|Epidemics]]''.<ref name=Martin>{{cite journal |author=Martin PM, Martin-Granel E |title=2,500-year evolution of the term epidemic |journal=Emerging Infect.
