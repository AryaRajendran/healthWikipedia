A '''maxillary sinus floor augmentation procedure'''<ref>Boyne, PJ. <u>De novo bone induction by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in maxillary sinus floor augmentation</u>. ''J Oral Maxillofac Surg'' 2005;63:1693-1707</ref> (sometimes known informally as a '''sinus-lift''' or '''sinus procedure''') is a [[Surgery|surgical procedure]] performed by an appropriately trained [[Dentistry|dentist]] or  [[Oral surgery|dental specialist]] to increase the amount of bone in the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|posterior]] [[maxilla]], or upper jaw bone.

While there may be a number of reasons for wanting a greater volume of bone in the posterior maxilla, the most common reason in contemporary dental treatment planning is to prepare the site for the future placement of [[dental implant]]s.

Sinus augmentation (sinus lift) is performed when the floor of the sinus is too close to an area where dental implants are to be placed. This procedure is performed to ensure a secure place for the implants while protecting the sinus. Lowering of the sinus can be caused by: Long-term tooth loss without the required treatment, periodontal disease, trauma.<ref>Brentwood Periodontists http://implantperiocenter.com/patient-education/sinus-augmentation-sinus-lift</ref>

== History ==
The first maxillary sinus floor augmentation procedure was performed by [[Hilt Tatum|Oscar Hilt Tatum, Jr.]] in 1974.

<!-- A sinus-lift procedure was first performed by Dr. Hilt Tatum Jr. in 1974 during his period of preparation to begin sinus grafting. The first sinus graft was done by Tatum in February, 1975 in Lee County Hospital in Opelika, Alabama. This was followed by the placement and successful restoration of two endosteal implants. Between 1975&ndash;1979, much of the sinus lining elevation was done using inflatable catheters. After this, suitable instruments had been developed to manage the lining elevation from the different anatomical surfaces encountered in sinuses. Tatum first presented the concept at The Alabama Implant Congress in Birmingham, Alabama in 1976 and presented the evolution of technique during multiple podium presentations each year until 1986 when he published an article describing the procedure. Dr. Philip Boyne was introduced to the procedure when he was invited, by Tatum, to be "The Discusser" of a presentation on sinus grafting given by Tatum at the annual meeting of The American Academy of Implant Dentistry in 1977 or 1978. Boyne and James authored the first publication on the technique in 1980 when they published case reports of autogenous grafts placed into the sinus and allowed to heal for 6 months, which was followed by the placement of blade implants. This sequence was confirmed by Boyne before the attendees at The Alabama Implant Congress in 1994. -->

== Surgical techniques ==

<!-- Straumann implant placed in site of maxillary left permanent first molar. Sinus floor provided approximately 6.8&nbsp;mm of apico-coronal height whereas placement of a 10&nbsp;mm implant was desirable. The sinus floor was thus lifted using the osteotome approach and packing bone into the osteotomy to lift the floor of the sinus. The dome of bone graft can be seen apical to the implant.
Today, there are several variations of sinus graft procedure, these are the most common:

Lateral Window approach (opening a window in the anterolateral sinus wall) - done by Tatum in February, 1975.- A crestal incision is made with vertical extensions and the lateral aspect of the maxilla is exposed. Then the osteotomy aka anthrostomy is completed. The sinus membrane, aka Schneiderian Membrane, is then detached from the bony walls of the internal aspects of the sinus, utilizing various curettes. Once properly detached, the lateral wall window with the sinus membrane is rotated medially into the sinus. The sinus membrane can fold on itself when reflected medially. Implant sites can be prepared and implants placed at this stage. The medial part of the sinus is grafted first. The graft material used can be either and autograft, an allograft, a xenograft, an alloplast a growth-factor infused collagen matrix, or combinations thereof. After the implants have been placed, the remaining lateral part of the sinus defect is grafted. The flaps are relieved and closed primarily. The graft is left for 6–9 months. Implant placements should be delayed if they cannot be properly stabilised, to prevent complications. Tatum does not recommend implant placement into the grafts at the time of sinus grafting. For most patients, he recommends a uniform lining elevation off all axial walls to a height necessary to result in a healed height of 18-20&nbsp;mm bone.
The Osteotome approach - First done by Tatum in 1974 and published by Summer in 1994 - A crestal incision is made, and the crestal ridge is exposed. A sharp osteotome is used to "chisel" a rectangle in the crestal ridge of the maxilla, then a sinus-lift osteotome is used like a mallet to fracture the bone, and punch a hole through where the rectangle was created into the sinus floor. The sinus is then raised with bone grafting material and implants are placed. Though this was the technique used by Tatum in 1974, he currently prefers a closed (floor elevation without sinus entry) technique.
*'''[[Hydraulic Sinus Condensing]]''' - Invented by Chen in 2005 - A crestal incision is made, exposing the crestal ridge of the maxilla. An osteotomy is initiated with a sinus drill, and water pressure is used to gently raise the sinus membrane from the sinus floor. Then the sinus membrane is raised with bone grafting material, and implants are placed. -->
