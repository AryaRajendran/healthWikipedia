==History of discovery==

===Carrión's disease===
{{main|Carrión's disease}}
The disease was named after medical student [[Daniel Alcides Carrión]] from [[Cerro de Pasco]], [[Peru]]. Carrión described the disease after being inoculated at his request with the pus of a skin lesion from patient Carmen Paredes in 1885 by Doctor Evaristo M. Chávez, a close friend and coworker in Dos de Mayo National Hospital. Carrión developed the disease three weeks after the inoculation and kept a meticulous record of clinical symptoms and signs until the disease rendered him incapable of the task and he died several weeks later. Carrión proved that "Oroya fever" and "Verruga Peruana" were two stages of the same disease, and not two different diseases as was thought at the time. Subsequently, 23 subspecies of Bartonella were discovered. His work did not result in a cure immediately, but his research started the process. Peru has named October 5 as "Peruvian Medicine Day" in his honor.

Peruvian microbiologist [[Alberto Barton]] discovered the causative bacterium in 1905, but his results were not published until 1909. Barton originally identified them as "endoglobular" structures, bacteria living inside red blood cells. Until 1993, the ''Bartonella'' [[genus]] contained only one species; there are now 23 identified species, all of them within the family of Bartonellaceae.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zeaiter Z, Liang Z, Raoult D | title = Genetic classification and differentiation of Bartonella species based on comparison of partial ftsZ gene sequences | journal = J.

===Cat-scratch disease===
{{main|Cat scratch disease}}
In 1988, English ''et al.'' <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.259.9.1347 |author=English CK, Wear DJ, Margileth AM, Lissner CR, Walsh GP |title=Cat-scratch disease.

This agent was considered the etiologic agent of Cat-scratch Disease (CSD) but further studies failed to support this conclusion. Serologic studies associated CSD with ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'', reported in 1992. In 1993 Dolan <ref>{{cite journal |author=Dolan MJ |title=Syndrome of Rochalimaea henselae adenitis suggesting cat scratch disease |journal=Ann. Intern.

''Bartonella'' spp. is commonly treated with antibiotics including azithromycin, based on a single small randomized clinical trial. Treatment may take up to one year to completely eliminate the disease.
CSD often resolves spontaneously without treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Resto-Ruiz S, Burgess A, Anderson BE |title=The role of the host immune response in pathogenesis of ''Bartonella henselae'' |journal=DNA Cell Biol. |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=431–40 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12906736 |doi=10.1089/104454903767650694}}</ref>

===Trench fever===
{{main|Trench fever}}
Detailed descriptions of the disease were reported in soldiers during the [[World War I|First World War]]. It is also known as five-day fever, quintan fever, Wolhinie fever and "urban trench fever", because it occurs in homeless people and alcoholics .<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(95)90430-1 |author=Stein A, Raoult D |title=Return of trench fever |journal=Lancet |volume=345 |issue=8947 |pages=450–1 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7853966 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(95)90430-1}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[Carrion's disease|Carrión's disease]], or Oroya fever, or Peruvian Wart is a rare [[infectious disease]] found only in [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Colombia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maguina C, Garcia PJ, Gotuzzo E, Cordero L, Spach DH |title=Bartonellosis (Carrión's disease) in the modern era |journal=Clin.

[[Cat scratch disease]] occurs worldwide. Cats are the main reservoir of ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'' (etiologic agent), and the bacterium is transmitted to cats by the cat flea ''[[Ctenocephalides felis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chomel BB |title=Experimental transmission of ''Bartonella henselae'' by the cat flea |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1952–6 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8818889 |pmc=229161 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8818889 |author-separator=, |author2=Kasten RW |author3=Floyd-Hawkins K |display-authors=3 |last4=Chi |first4=B |last5=Yamamoto |first5=K |last6=Roberts-Wilson |first6=J |last7=Gurfield |first7=AN |last8=Abbott |first8=RC |last9=Pedersen |first9=NC}}</ref> Infection in cats is very common with a prevalence estimated between 40-60%, younger cats being more commonly infective. Cats usually become immune to the infection, while dogs may be very symptomatic. Humans may also acquire it through flea or tick bites from infected dogs, cats, coyotes, and foxes.  

[[Trench fever]], produced by ''[[Bartonella quintana]]'' infection,  is transmitted by the [[human body louse]] ''Pediculus humanus corporis''.  Humans are the only known reservoir.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maurin M, Raoult D |title=''Bartonella (Rochalimaea) quintana'' infections |journal=Clin. Microbiol.

A possible role for ticks in transmission of ''Bartonella'' species remains to be elucidated; in November 2011, ''[[Bartonella rochalimae]]'', ''[[Bartonella quintana|B. quintana]]'', and ''[[Bartonella elizabethae|B. elizabethae]]'' DNA was first reported in ''[[Rhipicephalus sanguineus]]'' and ''[[Dermacentor nitens]]'' ticks in Peru; .<ref name="Bea">{{cite journal | author = Billeter Sarah A., Cáceres Abraham G., Gonzales-Hidalgo James, Luna-Caypo Deysi, Kosoy Michael Y. | year = 2011 | title = Molecular Detection of ''Bartonella'' Species in Ticks From Peru | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Entomology | volume = 48 | issue = 6| pages = 1257–1260 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
In mammals, each ''Bartonella'' species is highly adapted to its reservoir host as the result of intracellular parasitism and can persist in the bloodstream of the host. Intraerythrocytic parasitism is only observed in the acute phase of [[Carrion's disease|Carrión´s disease]]. ''Bartonella'' also have a tropism for endothelial cells, observed in the chronic phase of [[carrion's disease|Carrión´s disease]] (also known as ''Verruga Peruana'') and [[bacillary angiomatosis]].
Pathological response can vary with the immune status of the host. Infection with ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'' can result in a focal suppurative reaction (CSD in immunocompetent patients), a multifocal angioproliferative response ([[bacillary angiomatosis]] in immunocompromised patients), [[endocarditis]] or [[meningitis]].

==Clinical manifestations==

===Carrión's disease===
{{main|Carrión's disease}}
Patients can develop two clinical phases: an [[Acute (medical)|acute]] septic phase and a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] eruptive phase associated with [[dermatology|skin]] lesions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Maguiña Vargas, Ciro |title=Bartonellosis o enfermedad de Carrión: Nuevos aspectos de una vieja enfermedad |publisher=UNMSM, Fondo Editorial |location=Lima, Peru |year=2010 |isbn=9972-50-034-9 |pages= |url=http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/BibVirtual/libros/medicina/bartonellosis/indice.htm }}</ref> In the acute phase (also known as [[Oroya fever]] or ''Fiebre de la Oroya''), ''[[Bartonella bacilliformis]]'' infection is a sudden, potentially life-threatening infection associated with high [[fever]] and decreased levels of circulating [[red blood cell]]s (i.e., [[hemolytic anemia]])and transient immunosuppression.''[[Bartonella bacilliformis]]'' is considered the most deadly Bartonella to date, with a death rate of up to 90% during the acute phase, which typically lasts two-to-four weeks. [[Peripheral blood smear]]s show anisomacrocytosis with many [[bacilli]] adherent to [[red blood cells]]. [[Thrombocytopenia]] is also seen and can be very severe. Neurologic manifestations (neurobartonellosis) are altered mental status, agitation, or even coma, ataxia, spinal [[meningitis]] or [[paralysis]]. It is seen in 20% of patients with acute infection, in which case the [[prognosis]] is very guarded with an about 50% mortality. The most feared complication is overwhelming infection mainly by Enterobacteriacea, particularly ''[[Salmonella]]''(both ''S. typhi'' and S.non-typhi, as well as reactivation of ''[[Toxoplasmosis]]'' and other opportunistic infections . 

The chronic manifestation—''Verruga Peruana''—consists of a [[benign]] skin eruption with raised, reddish-purple [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]s ([[angioma|angiomatous tumours]]). The bacterium can be seen microscopically, if a skin biopsy is[[silver stain]]ed (the [[Warthin–Starry method]]).

===Cat scratch disease===
{{main|Cat scratch disease}}
Cat scratch disease is due to an infection by ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'' and manifests as gradual regional [[lymph nodes]] enlargement ([[axilla]], [[groin]], [[neck]])which may last 2–3 months or longer and a distal [[:wikt:scratch|scratch]] and/or red-brown skin [[papule]] (not always seen at the time of the disease). The enlarged lymph node is painful and tender. The  infection is self-limited.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Margileth AM |title=Cat scratch disease |journal=Adv Pediatr Infect Dis |volume=8 |issue= |pages=1–21 |year=1993 |pmid=8216999 }}</ref> The lymph nodes may suppurate and most patients can remain afebrile or asymptomatic.

===Bacillary angiomatosis===
''[[Bartonella henselae]]'' and ''[[Bartonella quintana]]'' can cause [[bacillary angiomatosis]], a [[Blood vessel|vascular]] proliferative disease involving mainly the skin, and other organs. The disease was first described in Human Immunodificiency Virus ([[HIV]])patients and [[organ transplant]] recipients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(90)90301-S |author=Kemper CA, Lombard CM, Deresinski SC, Tompkins LS |title=Visceral bacillary epithelioid angiomatosis: possible manifestations of disseminated cat scratch disease in the immunocompromised host: a report of two cases |journal=Am.
