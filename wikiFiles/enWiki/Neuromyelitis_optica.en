'''Neuromyelitis optica''' (NMO), also known as '''Devic's disease''' or '''Devic's syndrome''', is an [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]], [[inflammation|inflammatory]] disorder in which a person's own [[immune system]] attacks the [[optic nerve]]s and [[spinal cord]]. This produces an inflammation of the optic nerve ([[optic neuritis]]) and the spinal cord ([[myelitis]]). Although inflammation may also affect the brain, the lesions are different from those observed in the related condition, [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name=Pittock>{{cite journal |author=Pittock SJ, Weinshenker BG, Lucchinetti CF, Wingerchuk DM, Corboy JR, Lennon VA |title=Neuromyelitis optica brain lesions localized at sites of high aquaporin 4 expression |journal=Arch.

Devic's disease is a rare disorder which resembles [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) in several ways, but requires a different course of treatment for optimal results.<ref name=Wingerchuk/> It has also been suggested to be a variant form of [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]].<ref name=Lancet2004>{{cite journal |author=Lennon VA, Wingerchuk DM, Kryzer TJ, ''et al.'' |title=A serum autoantibody marker of neuromyelitis optica: distinction from multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9451 |pages=2106–2112 |year=2004 |pmid=15589308 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17551-X}}</ref> The likely target of the autoimmune attack, at least in some patients with NMO, has been identified as a [[protein]] of the [[nervous system]] cells called [[aquaporin 4]].<ref name=JExpMed2005>{{cite journal |author=Lennon VA, Kryzer TJ, Pittock SJ, Verkman AS, Hinson SR |title=IgG marker of optic-spinal multiple sclerosis binds to the aquaporin-4 water channel |journal=J.

==Symptoms==
The main symptoms of Devic's disease are loss of [[Visual perception|vision]] and spinal cord function.  [[Optic neuritis]] may manifest as visual impairment with decreased [[visual acuity]], although [[visual field]] defects, or loss of [[color vision]] may occur in isolation or prior to formal loss of acuity.  Spinal cord dysfunction can lead to muscle weakness, reduced sensation, or loss of [[urinary bladder|bladder]] and bowel control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/devics-disease/symptoms.html |author=Mayo Clinic|title=Devic's Disease Symptoms|accessdate=2008-03-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080102000230/http://www.mayoclinic.org/devics-disease/symptoms.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-02}}</ref>  The typical patient has an [[Acute (medical)|acute]] and severe [[spasticity|spastic]] [[muscle weakness|weakness]] of the legs ([[paraparesis]]) or all four limbs ([[quadriparesis]]) with sensory signs, often accompanied by loss of bladder control.

== Mechanism ==

Devic's disease is similar to MS in that the body's [[immune system]] attacks the [[myelin]] surrounding nerve cells. Unlike standard MS, the attacks are not believed to be mediated by the immune system's [[T cell]]s, but rather by [[antibody|antibodies]] called NMO-[[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]], or simply NMO antibodies.  These antibodies target the [[protein]] [[aquaporin 4]] in the [[cell membrane]]s of [[astrocyte]]s which acts as a channel for the transport of water across the cell membrane.<ref name=Wingerchuk/>  Aquaporin&nbsp;4 is found in the processes of the astrocytes that surround the [[blood–brain barrier]], a system responsible for preventing substances in the blood from crossing into the brain. The blood–brain barrier is weakened in Devic's disease, but it is currently unknown how the NMO-IgG immune response leads to demyelination.

Most research into the pathology of Devic's disease has focused on the spinal cord.  The damage can range from [[inflammation|inflammatory]] demyelination to [[necrosis|necrotic]] damage of the [[white matter|white]] and [[grey matter]]s.  The inflammatory lesions in Devic's disease have been [[Lesion patterns in multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|classified as type II lesions]] ([[complement system|complement]]-mediated demyelinization), but they differ from MS pattern II lesions in their prominent perivascular distribution. Therefore, the pattern of inflammation is often quite distinct from that seen in MS.<ref name=Wingerchuk/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lucchinetti CF, Mandler RN, McGavern D, ''et al.'' |title=A role for humoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Devic's neuromyelitis optica |journal=Brain |volume=125 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1450–1461 |year=2002 |pmid=12076996 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf151}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The [[Mayo Clinic]] proposed a revised set of criteria for diagnosis of Devic's disease in 2006.  The new guidelines require two absolute criteria plus at least two of three supportive criteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wingerchuk DM, Lennon VA, Pittock SJ, Lucchinetti CF, Weinshenker BG |title=Revised diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=1485–1489 |year=2006 |pmid=16717206 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000216139.44259.74}}</ref>

Absolute criteria:
# [[Optic neuritis]]
# Acute [[myelitis]]

Supportive criteria:
# [[Brain]] [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] not meeting criteria for MS at disease onset
# [[Spinal cord]] MRI with contiguous T2-weighted signal abnormality extending over three or more [[vertebra]]l segments, indicating a relatively large [[lesion]] in the spinal cord
# [[Immunoglobulin G|NMO-IgG]] seropositive status (The NMO-IgG test checks the existence of [[antibody|antibodies]] against the [[aquaporin 4]] [[antigen]].)

===Variants===
After the development of the NMO-IgG test, the spectrum of disorders comprising Devic's disease was expanded.  The spectrum is now believed to consist of:
* Standard Devic's disease, according to the diagnostic criteria described above
* Limited forms of Devic's disease, such as single or recurrent events of longitudinally extensive [[myelitis]], and bilateral simultaneous or recurrent [[optic neuritis]]
* Asian optic-spinal MS - this variant can present CNS involvement like MS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li Y, Xie P, Lv F, ''et al.'' |title=Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in neuromyelitis optica |journal=Acta Neurol.

* Longitudinally extensive [[myelitis]] or optic neuritis associated with systemic [[autoimmune]] disease
* Optic neuritis or myelitis associated with [[lesion]]s in specific brain areas such as the [[hypothalamus]], [[periventricular nucleus]], and [[brainstem]]<ref name=Symposium>{{cite conference | first =Dean | last =Wingerchuk  | title =Neuromyelitis Optica (Devic's Syndrome)  | booktitle =2006 Rare Neuroimmunologic Disorders Symposium| year =2006 | url =http://www.myelitis.org/rnds2006/Wingerchuk_NMO_Rare%20Neuroimm_062406_final.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref>

Whether Devic's disease is a distinct disease or part of the wide [[borderline forms of multiple sclerosis|spectrum of multiple sclerosis]] is debated.<ref name=Saida>{{cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Overview of MS: proposal of new MS definition/classification and review of the results of recent clinical trials |journal=Nippon Rinsho | year=2008  |pmid=18540351 |format=abstract |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1081–6}}</ref> Devic's disease differs in that it usually has more severe [[sequelae]] after an acute episode than standard MS, MS infrequently presents as [[transverse myelitis]], and oligoclonal bands in the [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]], as well as [[white matter]] lesions on brain MRI, are uncommon in Devic's disease, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.<ref name=Pearce>{{cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Neuromyelitis optica |journal=Spinal Cord |volume=43 |issue=11 |pages=631–634 |year=2005 |pmid=15968305 |doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3101758|url=http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v43/n11/abs/3101758a.html |format=abstract}}</ref> 

Recently, antiviral immune response has been found to distinguish standard multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jarius S, Franciotta D, Bergamaschi R ''et al.'' | title=Polyspecific, antiviral immune response distinguishes multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. |volume= 79|issue= 10|pages= 1134–6|year=2008 |pmid=18270237 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2007.133330}}</ref> but as MS is a heterogeneous condition,<ref>Hans Lassmann et al. Heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis: implications for diagnosis and therapy, Trends in Molecular Medicine, Volume 7, Issue 3, 1 March 2001, Pages 115-121, {{doi|10.1016/S1471-4914(00)01909-2}}</ref> as [[hepatitis]] or [[diabetes]] are, it is still possible to consider NMO as part of the MS spectrum.

===Causes===

Devic's disease has been associated with many systemic diseases, based on anecdoctal evidence of some Devic's disease patients with a [[comorbidity|comorbid]] condition.  Such conditions include: collagen vascular diseases, autoantibody syndromes,  [[infection]]s with [[varicella-zoster virus]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]], and [[HIV]], and exposure to [[clioquinol]] and [[Tuberculosis treatment|antituberculosis drugs]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cree BA, Goodin DS, Hauser SL |title=Neuromyelitis optica |journal=Seminars in neurology |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=105–122 |year=2002 |pmid=12524556 |doi=10.1055/s-2002-36534}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Methylprednisolone.svg|thumb|right|Chemical structure of methylprednisolone, which is used to treat attacks]]
Currently, there is no cure for Devic's disease, but symptoms can be treated.  Some patients recover, but many are left with impairment of vision and limbs, which can be severe.

===Attacks===
Attacks are treated with short courses of high dosage [[intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[methylprednisolone]] IV. When attacks progress or do not respond to corticosteroid treatment, [[plasmapheresis]] can be an effective treatment.<ref name=Symposium/>  Clinical trials for these treatments contain very small numbers, and most are uncontrolled.

===Secondary prevention===
No controlled trials have established the effectiveness of treatments for the prevention of attacks. Many clinicians agree that  long term [[immunosuppression]] is required to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks, while others argue the exact opposite.<ref name="Poser and Brinar 2007">{{cite journal |author=Poser CM, Brinar VV |title=Disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis: two different diseases – a critical review |journal=Acta Neurol.

==Prognosis==
Normally, some measure of improvement appears in a few weeks, but residual signs and [[disability]] may persist, sometimes severely.

The disease can be monophasic, i.e. a single episode with permanent [[remission (medicine)|remission]].  However, at least 85% of patients have a relapsing form of the disease with repeated attacks of [[transverse myelitis]] and/or [[optic neuritis]]. In patients with the monophasic form, the transverse myelitis and optic neuritis occur simultaneously or within days of each other.  On the other hand, patients with the relapsing form are more likely to have weeks or months between the initial attacks, and to have better motor recovery after the initial transverse myelitis event. Relapses usually occur early, with about 55% of patients having a relapse in the first year and 90% in the first five years.<ref name=Wingerchuk/>  Unlike multiple sclerosis, Devic's disease rarely has a secondary progressive phase in which patients have increasing neurologic decline between attacks without remission. Instead, disabilities arise from the acute attacks.<ref name=Wingerchuk/>

Approximately 20% of patients with monophasic Devic's disease have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs.  Among patients with relapsing Devic's disease, 50% have paralysis or blindness within five years.  In some patients (33% in one study), transverse myelitis in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death.  However, the spectrum of Devic's disease has widened due to improved diagnostic criteria, and the options for treatment have improved; as a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered.<ref name=Wingerchuk/>

== Epidemiology ==
The [[prevalence]] and [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of Devic's disease has not been established, partly because the disease is underrecognized and often confused with MS.<ref name=Wingerchuk/>  Devic's disease is more common in women than men, with women comprising over two-thirds of patients and more than 80% of those with the relapsing form of the disease.<ref name=Wingerchuk/>

According to the Walton Centre in England, "NMO seems to be present across the world unlike MS, which has a higher incidence in temperate climates and white races. Africans and Asians especially in Far East may have a higher risk of NMO, although the exact incidence of this disease is unknown, making specific conclusions difficult". Although many people who have Devic's disease were  initially misdiagnosed with MS, 35% of African Americans are often misdiagnosed with MS when they really have NMO.

Devic's disease is more common in [[asian people|Asiana]] than [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]s.  In fact, Asian optic-spinal MS (which constitutes 30% of the cases of MS in [[Japan]]) has been suggested to be identical to Devic's disease (differences between optic-spinal and classic MS in Japanese patients). In the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]] of [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Subtropics|subtropical regions]], MS is rare, but when it appears, it often takes the form of optic-spinal MS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cabre P, Signate A, Olindo S, ''et al.'' |title=Role of return migration in the emergence of multiple sclerosis in the French West Indies |journal=Brain |volume=128 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=2899–2910 |year=2005 |pmid=16183661 |doi=10.1093/brain/awh624}}</ref>

The majority of Devic's disease patients have no affected relatives, and it is generally regarded as a nonfamilial condition.<ref name=Wingerchuk/>

==History==
[[File:Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[Thomas Clifford Allbutt]] first reported an association between [[myelitis]] and an [[optic nerve]] disorder]]

In 1870, Sir [[Thomas Clifford Allbutt]] first reported an association between [[myelitis]] and an [[optic nerve]] disorder. In 1894, [[Eugène Devic]] and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] student Fernand Gault described 16 patients who had lost [[Visual perception|vision]] in one or both [[human eye|eye]]s and within weeks developed severe [[Spasticity|spastic]] [[muscle weakness|weakness]] of the limbs, loss of sensation and often [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] control. They recognized these symptoms were the result of [[inflammation]] of the optic nerve and spinal cord, respectively.<ref name=Devic1894>{{cite journal | author=Devic E | title=Myélite subaiguë compliquée de névrite optique | language=French | journal=Bull Med | year=1894 | volume=8 | pages=1033}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author= T. Jock Murray |title=Multiple Sclerosis: The History of a Disease |publisher=Demos Medical Publishing |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-888799-80-3}}</ref>

Similar instances of [[optic neuritis]] and myelitis were reported, and many believed it constituted a distinct clinical entity. However, some patients had [[pathology]] in other parts of the [[brain]], a feature which was more suggestive of [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]] or MS.

In 2004, [[Mayo Clinic]] researchers identified the [[aquaporin 4]] protein as the target of the disease and developed a test to aid in the diagnosis of Devic's disease by detection of an antibody, NMO-[[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]], in the blood.<ref name=JExpMed2005/> Some patients with NMO may be [[serostatus|seronegative]] for NMO-IgG, whilst some patients with NMO-IgG may still not fulfill clinical criteria for NMO thus serological testing is now an important part  of the diagnostic procedure and seropositive and seronegative cases are described in a manner similar to [[myasthenia gravis]]. According to the Mayo Clinic report, this was the first time a molecular target had been identified for a type of demyelinating inflammatory disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/devics-disease/research.html |title=Devic's Disease Research – Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

==Research directions==

Since the discovery of AQP-4 involvement, some research studies have focused on targeted treatment aimed at anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies. The most established method for antibody removal is [[plasmapheresis]]. A number of drugs is being studied: [[aquaporumab]] (non-pathogenic antibody blocker of AQP4-IgG binding), [[sivelestat]] (neutrophil elastase inhibitor), and [[eculizumab]] (complement inhibitor).<ref name="pmid22608667">{{cite journal |author=Papadopoulos MC, Verkman AS |title=Aquaporin 4 and neuromyelitis optica |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=535–44 |year=2012 |month=June |pmid=22608667 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70133-3 |url=}}</ref>
