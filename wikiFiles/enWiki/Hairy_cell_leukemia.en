'''Hairy cell leukemia''' is an uncommon [[hematological malignancy]] characterized by an accumulation of abnormal [[B lymphocyte]]s.  It is usually classified as a sub-type of [[chronic lymphoid leukemia]]. Hairy cell leukemia makes up approximately 2% of all [[leukemia]]s, with fewer than 2,000 new cases diagnosed annually in North America and Western Europe combined.  

Hairy cell leukemia was originally described as histiocytic leukemia, malignant reticulosis, or lymphoid myelofibrosis in publications dating back to the 1920s. The disease was formally named leukemic reticuloendotheliosis and its characterization significantly advanced by Bertha Bouroncle and colleagues at [[OSU College of Medicine and Public Health|The Ohio State University College of Medicine]] in 1958.  Its common name, which was coined in 1966,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schrek R, Donnelly WJ |title="Hairy" cells in blood in lymphoreticular neoplastic disease and "flagellated" cells of normal lymph nodes |journal=Blood |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=199–211 |year=1966 |month=February |pmid=5322749 |doi= |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/2/199}}</ref> is derived from the "hairy" appearance of the malignant B cells under a microscope.

==Classification==
When not further specified, the "classic" form is often implied. However, two variants have been described:  Hairy cell leukemia-variant,<ref name="urlAmerican Journal of Clinical Pathology">{{cite journal |url=http://ajcp.metapress.com/link.asp?id=8qytyq1clqmhq9cl |title=American Journal of Clinical Pathology |work= |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> which usually is diagnosed in men, and a Japanese variant.  The non-Japanese variant is more difficult to treat than either 'classic' HCL or the Japanese variant HCL.

===Hairy cell leukemia-variant===
'''Hairy cell leukemia-variant''', or HCL-V, is usually described as a prolymphocytic variant of hairy cell leukemia.<ref name="bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org">{{cite journal |author=Sainati L, Matutes E, Mulligan S, ''et al.'' |title=A variant form of hairy cell leukemia resistant to ''alpha''-interferon: clinical and phenotypic characteristics of 17 patients |journal=Blood |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=157–62 |year=1990 |month=July |pmid=2364167 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2364167}}</ref>  It was first formally described in 1980 by a paper from the University of Cambridge's Hayhoe lab.<ref name="pmid7206776">{{cite journal |author=Cawley JC, Burns GF, Hayhoe FG |title=A chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with distinctive features: a distinct variant of hairy-cell leukaemia |journal=Leuk.

Similar to [[B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]] ("B-PLL") in [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], HCL-V is a more aggressive disease.  It is less likely to be treated successfully than is classic HCL, and remissions tend to be shorter.  Many treatment approaches, such as [[Interferon]]-''alpha'', the combination chemotherapy regimen "CHOP", and common alkylating agents like [[cyclophosphamide]] provide very little benefit.<ref name="pmid11243388" /> Pentostatin and cladribine provide some benefit to many HCL-V patients, but typically induce shorter remission periods and lower response rates than when they are used in classic HCL.  More than half of victims respond partially to splenectomy.<ref name="pmid11243388" />

In terms of B-cell development, the [[prolymphocytes]] are less developed than are [[lymphocytes]] or [[plasma cells]], but are still more mature than their [[lymphoblast]]ic precursors.

HCL-V differs from classic HCL principally in the following respects:
* Higher [[white blood cell]] counts, sometimes exceeding 100,000 cells per microliter;
* A more aggressive course of disease requiring more frequent treatment;
* Hairy cells with an unusually large [[nucleolus]] for their size;
* Production of little excess [[fibronectin]] produced by classic hairy cells;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burthem J, Cawley JC |title=The bone marrow fibrosis of hairy-cell leukemia is caused by the synthesis and assembly of a fibronectin matrix by the hairy cells |journal=Blood |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=497–504 |year=1994 |month=January |pmid=8286747 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8286747}}</ref> to interfere with bone marrow biopsies; and
* Low or no cell-surface expression of [[CD25]] (also called the Interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor ''alpha'' chain, or p55).<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Totero D, Tazzari PL, Lauria F, ''et al''. |title=Phenotypic analysis of hairy cell leukemia: "variant" cases express the interleukin-2 receptor ''beta'' chain, but not the ''alpha'' chain (CD25) |journal=Blood |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=528–35 |year=1993 |month=July |pmid=8329708 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8329708}}</ref>

Low levels of CD25, a part of the receptor for a key immunoregulating hormone, may explain why HCL-V cases are generally much more resistant to treatment by immune system hormones.<ref name="bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org"/>

HCL-V, which usually features a high proportion of hairy cells without a functional [[p53]] [[tumor suppressor gene]], is somewhat more likely to transform into a higher-grade malignancy. A typical transformation rate of 5%-6% has been postulated in the U.K., similar to the [[Richter's transformation]] rate for SLVL and CLL.<ref name="pmid11243388" /><ref name="pmid12670464">{{cite journal |author=Matutes E, Wotherspoon A, Catovsky D |title=The variant form of hairy-cell leukaemia |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Haematol |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=41–56 |year=2003 |pmid=12670464 |doi=10.1016/S1521-6926(02)00086-5}}</ref>  Among HCL-V patients, the most aggressive cases normally have the least amount of p53 gene activity.<ref name="pmid10576509">{{cite journal |author=Vallianatou K, Brito-Babapulle V, Matutes E, Atkinson S, Catovsky D |title=p53 gene deletion and trisomy 12 in hairy cell leukemia and its variant |journal=Leuk.

===Hairy cell leukemia-Japanese variant===
'''Hairy cell leukemia-Japanese variant''' or HCL-J.  There is also a Japanese variant, which is more easily treated.

Treatment with [[cladribine]] has been reported.<ref name="pmid15199752">{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki M, Taguchi A, Sakuragi S, Mitani N, Matsuda K, Shinohara K |title=[Hairy cell leukemia, Japanese variant, successfully treated with cladribine] |language=Japanese |journal=Rinsho Ketsueki |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=405–7 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15199752 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
In hairy cell leukemia, the "hairy cells" (malignant B lymphocytes) accumulate in the bone marrow, interfering with the production of normal [[white blood cells]], [[red blood cells]], and [[platelets]].  Consequently, patients may develop infections related to [[neutropenia|low white blood cell count]], [[anemia]] and fatigue due to a lack of red blood cells, or easy bleeding due to a [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/treatment/hairy-cell-leukemia/patient#Keypoint3 |title=Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=2007-09-07 |work=}}</ref> Leukemic cells may gather in the [[spleen]] and cause it to swell; this can have the side effect of making the person feel full even when he or she has not eaten much.  

Hairy cell leukemia is commonly diagnosed after a routine blood count shows unexpectedly low numbers of one or more kinds of normal blood cells, or after unexplained bruises or recurrent infections in an otherwise apparently healthy patient.  

Platelet function may be somewhat impaired in HCL patients, although this does not appear to have any significant practical effect.<ref name="pmid512041">{{cite journal |author=Zuzel M, Cawley JC, Paton RC, Burns GF, McNicol GP |title=Platelet function in hairy-cell leukaemia |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=814–21 |year=1979 |pmid=512041 |doi=10.1136/jcp.32.8.814 |pmc=1145815}}</ref>  It may result in somewhat more mild bruises than would otherwise be expected for a given platelet count or a mildly increased bleeding time for a minor cut.  It is likely the result of producing slightly abnormal platelets in the overstressed bone marrow tissue. 

Patients with a high tumor burden may also have somewhat reduced levels of cholesterol,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pandolfino J, Hakimian D, Rademaker AW, Tallman MS |title=Hypocholesterolemia in hairy cell leukemia: a marker for proliferative activity |journal=Am.

==Cause==
As with many cancers, the cause of hairy cell leukemia is unknown. Exposure to tobacco smoke, [[ionizing radiation]], or industrial chemicals (with the possible exception of [[diesel fuel|diesel]]) does not appear to increase the risk of developing HCL.<ref name="pmid7577624">{{cite journal |author=Clavel J, Mandereau L, Cordier S, ''et al.'' |title=Hairy cell leukaemia, occupation, and smoking |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=154–61 |year=1995 |pmid=7577624 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05261.x}}</ref>  Farming and gardening appear to increase the risk of HCL in some studies.<ref name="pmid11083509">{{cite journal |author=Orlandi G, Fanucchi S, Strata G, ''et al.'' |title=Transient autonomic nervous system dysfunction during hyperacute stroke |journal=Acta Neurol.

Recent studies have identified somatic BRAF V600E mutations in all patients with the classic form of hairy cell leukemia thus sequenced, but in no patients with the variant form.<ref name="pmid21663470">{{cite journal | author=Tiacci E, ''et al.'' |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=364 |issue=24 |pages=2305–2315 |year=2011 |pmid=21663470 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1014209}}</ref>

The U.S. [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) announced "sufficient evidence" of an association between exposure to herbicides and later development of chronic B-cell leukemias and lymphomas in general. The IOM report emphasized that neither animal nor human studies indicate an association of herbicides with HCL specifically. However, the IOM extrapolated data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] to conclude that HCL and other rare B-cell neoplasms may share this risk factor.<ref>{{cite book

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of HCL may be suggested by abnormal results on a [[complete blood count]] (CBC), but additional testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A CBC normally shows low counts for white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in HCL patients.  However, if large numbers of hairy cells are in the blood stream, then normal or even [[lymphocytosis|high lymphocyte counts]] may be found.

On physical exam, 80–90% of patients have an [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]], which can be massive.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>    This is less likely among patients who are diagnosed at an early stage.  Peripheral [[lymphadenopathy]] (enlarged lymph nodes) is uncommon (less than 5% of patients), but abdominal lymphadenopathy is a relatively common finding on [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  

[[File:Hairy cell leukemia smear 2009-08-20.JPG|thumb|Hairy cell leukemia: abnormal B cells look "hairy" under a microscope because of radial projections from their surface.]]
The most important lab finding is the presence of hairy cells in the bloodstream.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  Hairy cells are abnormal [[white blood cell]]s with hair-like projections of [[cytoplasm]]; they can be seen by examining a [[blood smear]] or [[bone marrow biopsy]] specimen.  The blood film examination is done by [[staining]] the blood cells with Wright's stain and looking at them under a [[microscope]].  Hairy cells are visible in this test in about 85% of cases.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  

Most patients require a bone marrow biopsy for final diagnosis.  The bone marrow biopsy is used both to confirm the presence of HCL and also the absence of any additional diseases, such as [[Splenic marginal zone lymphoma]] or [[B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]].  The diagnosis can be confirmed by viewing the cells with a special stain known as TRAP ([[tartrate resistant acid phosphatase]]). 

It is also possible to definitively diagnose hairy cell leukemia through [[flow cytometry]] on blood or bone marrow.  The hairy cells are larger than normal and positive for [[CD19]], [[CD20]], [[CD22]], [[CD11c]], [[CD25]], [[CD103]], and [[FMC7]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flowcases.org/casebuilder/index.cfm?fuseaction=displayCase2&caseID=54 |title=Clinical Flow Cytometry Case #54 |accessdate=2007-09-07 |work=}}</ref> ([[CD103]], [[CD22]], and [[CD11c]] are strongly expressed.)<ref name="pmid18798068">{{cite journal |author=Cannon T, Mobarek D, Wegge J, Tabbara IA |title=Hairy cell leukemia: current concepts |journal=Cancer Invest. |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=860–5 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18798068 |doi=10.1080/07357900801965034 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/07357900801965034&magic=pubmed&#124;&#124;1B69BA326FFE69C3F0A8F227DF8201D0}}</ref>

Hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-V), which shares some characteristics with B cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), does not show CD25 (also called the Interleukin-2 receptor, alpha).  As this is relatively new and expensive technology, its adoption by physicians is not uniform, despite the advantages of comfort, simplicity, and safety for the patient when compared to a bone marrow biopsy.  The presence of additional [[lymphoproliferative disease]]s is easily checked during a flow cytometry test, where they characteristically show different results.<ref name="pmid16880237"/>

The differential diagnoses include:  several kinds of [[anemia]], including [[myelophthisis]] and [[aplastic anemia]],<ref>{{EMedicine|med|937|Hairy Cell Leukemia|Differentials}}</ref> and most kinds of blood neoplasms, including hypoplastic [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia, [[B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]], or idiopathic [[myelofibrosis]].<ref name="pmid16880237">{{cite journal |author=Wanko SO, de Castro C |title=Hairy cell leukemia: an elusive but treatable disease |journal=[[Oncologist]] |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=780–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16880237 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.11-7-780 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/11/7/780 |quote=[http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/11/7/780/T4.large.jpg <br/>Table 4. Phenotypic differential diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia]}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Pancytopenia]] in HCL is caused primarily by marrow failure and [[splenomegaly]].  Bone marrow failure is caused by the accumulation of hairy cells and reticulin [[fibrosis]] in the bone marrow, as well as by the detrimental effects of dysregulated cytokine production.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>   Splenomegaly reduces blood counts through sequestration, marginalization, and destruction of healthy blood cells inside the spleen.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  

Hairy cells are nearly mature [[B cell]]s, which are activated clonal cells with signs of VH gene differentiation.<ref name="pmid16880237"/>  They may be related to pre-plasma [[marginal zone]] B cells<ref name="Wintrobe">{{cite book

[[Cytokine]] production is disturbed in HCL.  Hairy cells produce and thrive on [[TNF-alpha]].<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  This cytokine also suppresses normal production of healthy blood cells in the bone marrow.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  

Unlike healthy B cells, hairy cells express and secrete an immune system protein called [[Interleukin-2 receptor]] (IL-2R).<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  In HCL-V, only part of this receptor is expressed.<ref name="Wintrobe"/> As a result, disease status can be monitored by measuring changes in the amount of IL-2R in the blood serum.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  The level increases as hairy cells proliferate, and decreases when they are killed.  Although uncommonly used in North America and northern Europe, this test correlates better with disease status and predicts relapse more accurately than any other test.

Hairy cells respond to normal production of some cytokines by [[T cell]]s with increased growth.  Treatment with Interferon-alpha suppresses the production of this pro-growth cytokine from T cells.<ref name="Wintrobe" />  A low level of T cells, which is commonly seen after treatment with [[cladribine]] or [[pentostatin]], and the consequent reduction of these cytokines, is also associated with reduced levels of hairy cells.

==Treatment==
Several treatments are available, and successful control of the disease is common.  

'''Not everyone needs treatment.''' Treatment is usually given when the symptoms of the disease interfere with the patient's everyday life, or when white blood cell or platelet counts decline to dangerously low levels, such as an [[absolute neutrophil count]] below one thousand cells per microliter (1.0 K/uL).  Not all patients need treatment immediately upon diagnosis, and about 10% of patients will never need treatment.  

'''Treatment delays are less important than in solid tumors.''' Unlike most cancers, treatment success does not depend on treating the disease at an early stage.  Because delays do not affect treatment success, there are no standards for how quickly a patient should receive treatment.  However, waiting too long can cause its own problems, such as an infection that might have been avoided by proper treatment to restore immune system function.  Also, having a higher number of hairy cells at the time of treatment can make certain side effects somewhat worse, as some side effects are primarily caused by the body's natural response to the dying hairy cells.  This can result in the hospitalization of a patient whose treatment would otherwise be carried out entirely at the hematologist's office. 

'''Single-drug treatment is typical.'''  Unlike most cancers, only one drug is normally given to a patient at a time.  While monotherapy is normal, combination therapy—typically using one first-line therapy and one second-line therapy—is being studied in current clinical trials and is used more frequently for refractory cases.  Combining rituximab with cladribine or pentostatin may or may not produce any practical benefit to the patient.<ref name="pmid16497968">{{cite journal

|pmid=16497968 
|doi=10.1182/blood-2005-11-4590}}</ref> Combination therapy is almost never used with a new patient.  Because the success rates with purine analog monotherapy are already so high, the additional benefit from immediate treatment with a second drug in a treatment-naïve patient is assumed to be very low.  For example, one round of either cladribine or pentostatin gives the median first-time patient a decade-long remission; the addition of rituximab, which gives the median patient only three or four years, might provide no additional value for this easily treated patient.  In a more difficult case, however, the benefit from the first drug may be substantially reduced and therefore a combination may provide some benefit.

===First-line therapy:  purine analog chemotherapy===
[[Cladribine]] (2CDA) and [[pentostatin]] (DCF) are the two most common first-line therapies.  They both belong to a class of medications called [[purine analog]]s, which have mild side effects compared to traditional [[chemotherapy]] regimens.  

Cladribine can be administered by injection under the skin, by infusion over a couple of hours into a vein, or by a pump worn by the patient that provides a slow drip into a vein, 24 hours a day for 7 days.  Most patients receive cladribine by IV infusion once a day for five to seven days, but more patients are being given the option of taking this drug once a week for six weeks.  The different dosing schedules used with cladribine are approximately equally effective and equally safe.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-08-042929 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/bloodjournal;109/9/3672 |last1=Robak |first1=T |last2=Jamroziak |first2=K |last3=Gora-Tybor |first3=J |last4=Blonski |first4=JZ |last5=Kasznicki |first5=M |last6=Dwilewicz-Trojaczek |first6=J |last7=Wiater |first7=E |last8=Zdunczyk |first8=A |last9=Dybowicz |first9=J |title=Cladribine in a weekly versus daily schedule for untreated active hairy cell leukemia: final report from the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) of a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial |journal=Blood |volume=109 |issue=9 |pages=3672–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17209059}}</ref>
Relatively few patients have significant side effects other than fatigue and a high fever caused by the cancer cells dying, although complications like infection and acute kidney failure have been seen. 

Pentostatin is chemically similar to cladribine, and has a similar success rate and side effect profile, but it is always given over a much longer period of time, usually one dose by IV infusion every two weeks for three to six months.

During the weeks following treatment the patient's [[immune system]] is severely weakened, but their [[bone marrow]] will begin to produce normal blood cells again.  Treatment often results in long-term remission. About 85% of patients achieve a complete response from treatment with either cladribine or pentostatin, and another 10% receive some benefit from these drugs, although there is no permanent cure for this disease.  If the cancer cells return, the treatment may be repeated and should again result in remission, although the odds of success decline with repeated treatment.<ref name="pmid16245328">{{cite journal |author=Else M, Ruchlemer R, Osuji N, ''et al.'' |title=Long remissions in hairy cell leukemia with purine analogs: a report of 219 patients with a median follow-up of 12.5 years |journal=Cancer |volume=104 |issue=11 |pages=2442–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16245328 |doi=10.1002/cncr.21447}}</ref>  Remission lengths vary significantly, from one year to more than twenty years.  The median patient can expect a treatment-free interval of about ten years.

It does not seem to matter which drug a patient receives.  A patient who is not successfully treated with one of these two drugs has a reduced chance of being successfully treated with the other.  However, there are other options.

===Second-line therapy:  immunotherapy===
If a patient is resistant to either cladribine or pentostatin, then second-line therapy is pursued.  

'''Monoclonal antibodies''' The most common treatment for cladribine-resistant disease is infusing monoclonal antibodies that destroy cancerous B cells.  [[Rituximab]] is by far the most commonly used.  Most patients receive one IV infusion over several hours each week for four to eight weeks.  A 2003 publication found two partial and ten complete responses out of 15 patients with relapsed disease, for a total of 80% responding.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-02-0630 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/102/12/3906 |last1=Thomas |first1=DA |last2=O'Brien |first2=S |last3=Bueso-Ramos |first3=C |last4=Faderl |first4=S |last5=Keating |first5=MJ |last6=Giles |first6=FJ |last7=Cortes |first7=J |last8=Kantarjian |first8=HM |title=Rituximab in relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia |journal=Blood |volume=102 |issue=12 |pages=3906–11 |year=2003 |pmid=12816862}}</ref>  The median patient (including non-responders) did not require further treatment for more than three years.  This eight-dose study had a higher response rate than a four-dose study at Scripps, which achieved only 25% response rate.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-01-0014 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/102/3/810 |last1=Nieva |first1=J |last2=Bethel |first2=K |last3=Saven |first3=A |title=Phase 2 study of rituximab in the treatment of cladribine-failed patients with hairy cell leukemia |journal=Blood |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=810–3 |year=2003 |pmid=12663446}}</ref>  Rituximab has successfully induced a complete response in Hairy Cell-Variant.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Narat S, Gandla J, Dogan A, Mehta A |title=Successful treatment of hairy cell leukemia variant with rituximab |journal=Leuk. Lymphoma |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=1229–32 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16085567 |doi=10.1080/10428190500083433 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10428190500083433}}</ref>

Rituximab's major side effect is serum sickness, commonly described as an "allergic reaction", which can be severe, especially on the first infusion.  Serum sickness is primarily caused by the antibodies clumping during infusion and triggering the [[complement system|complement]] cascade.  Although most patients find that side effects are adequately controlled by anti-allergy drugs, some severe, and even fatal, reactions have occurred.  Consequently, the first dose is always given in a hospital setting, although subsequent infusions may be given in a physician's office.  Remissions are usually shorter than with the preferred first-line drugs, but hematologic remissions of several years' duration are not uncommon. 

Other B cell-destroying monoclonal antibodies such as [[Alemtuzumab]], [[Ibritumomab tiuxetan]] and I-131 [[Tositumomab]] may be considered for refractory cases.

'''Interferon-alpha'''  [[Interferon-alpha]] is an immune system hormone that is very helpful to a relatively small number of patients, and somewhat helpful to most patients.  In about 65% of patients,<ref>{{EMedicine|med|937|Hairy Cell Leukemia|medication}}</ref> the drug helps stabilize the disease or produce a slow, minor improvement for a partial response.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Quesada JR, Reuben J, Manning JT, Hersh EM, Gutterman JU |title=Alpha interferon for induction of remission in hairy-cell leukemia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=310 |issue=1 |pages=15–8 |year=1984 |month=January |pmid=6689734 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198401053100104 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM198401053100104}}</ref>  

The typical dosing schedule injects at least 3 million units of Interferon-alpha (not pegylated versions) three times a week, although the original protocol began with six months of daily injections.  

Some patients tolerate IFN-alpha very well after the first couple of weeks, while others find that its characteristic [[flu-like symptoms]] persist.  About 10% of patients develop a level of [[depression (mood)|depression]].  It is possible that, by maintaining a steadier level of the hormone in the body, that daily injections might cause fewer side effects in selected patients.  Drinking at least two liters of water each day, while avoiding caffeine and alcohol, can reduce many of the side effects.

A drop in blood counts is usually seen during the first one to two months of treatment.  Most patients find that their blood counts get worse for a few weeks immediately after starting treatment, although some patients find their blood counts begin to improve within just two weeks.<ref name="pmid3971043">{{cite journal |author=Ratain MJ, Golomb HM, Vardiman JW, Vokes EE, Jacobs RH, Daly K |title=Treatment of hairy cell leukemia with recombinant alpha 2 interferon |journal=Blood |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=644–8 |year=1985 |pmid=3971043 |doi=}}</ref>

It typically takes six months to figure out whether this therapy is useful.  Common criteria for treatment success include:
* normalization of hemoglobin levels (above 12.0 g/dL),
* a normal or somewhat low platelet count (above 100 K/µL), and
* a normal or somewhat low absolute neutrophil count (above 1.5 K/µL).<ref name="pmid3971043" />

If it is well tolerated, patients usually take the hormone for 12 to 18 months.  An attempt may be made then to end the treatment, but most patients discover that they need to continue taking the drug for it to be successful.  These patients often continue taking this drug indefinitely, until either the disease becomes resistant to this hormone, or the body produces an immune system response that limits the drug's ability to function.  A few patients are able to achieve a sustained clinical remission after taking this drug for six months to one year.  This may be more likely when IFN-alpha has been initiated shortly after another therapy.  Interferon-alpha is considered the drug of choice for pregnant women with active HCL, although it carries some risks, such as the potential for decreased blood flow to the placenta.

Interferon-alpha works by sensitizing the hairy cells to the killing effect of the immune system hormone TNF-alpha, whose production it promotes.<ref name="pmid12091360">{{cite journal |author=Baker PK, Pettitt AR, Slupsky JR, ''et al.'' |title=Response of hairy cells to IFN-alpha involves induction of apoptosis through autocrine TNF-alpha and protection by adhesion |journal=Blood |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=647–53 |year=2002 |pmid=12091360 |doi=10.1182/blood.V100.2.647}}</ref>  IFN-alpha works best on classic hairy cells that are not protectively adhered to vitronectin or fibronectin, which suggests that patients who encounter less fibrous tissue in their bone marrow biopsies may be more likely to respond to Interferon-alpha therapy.  It also explains why non-adhered hairy cells, such as those in the bloodstream, disappear during IFN-alpha treatment well before reductions are seen in adhered hairy cells, such as those in the bone marrow and spleen.<ref name="pmid12091360" />

===Other treatment options===
'''[[Splenectomy]]''' can produce long-term remissions in patients whose spleens seem to be heavily involved, but its success rate is noticeably lower than cladribine or pentostatin.  Splenectomies are also performed for patients whose persistently enlarged spleens cause significant discomfort or in patients whose persistently low platelet counts suggest [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]].

'''[[Bone marrow transplant]]s''' are usually shunned in this highly treatable disease because of the inherent risks in the procedure.  They may be considered for refractory cases in younger, otherwise healthy individuals.  "Mini-transplants" are possible.

Patients with [[anemia]] or [[thrombocytopenia]] may also receive red blood cells and platelets through '''[[blood transfusions]]'''.  Blood transfusions are always irradiated to remove white blood cells and thereby reduce the risk of [[graft-versus-host disease]].  Patients may also receive a hormone to stimulate production of red blood cells.  These treatments may be [[medical necessity|medically necessary]], but do not kill the hairy cells.

Patients with low [[neutrophil]] counts may be given '''[[filgrastim]]''' or a similar hormone to stimulate production of white blood cells.  However, a 1999 study indicates that routine administration of this expensive injected drug has no practical value for HCL patients after cladribine administration.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Saven |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/93/8/2471 |first1=A |last2=Burian |first2=C |last3=Adusumalli |first3=J |last4=Koziol |first4=JA |title=Filgrastim for Cladribine-Induced Neutropenic Fever in Patients With Hairy Cell Leukemia |journal=Blood |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=2471–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10194424}}</ref>  In this study, patients who received filgrastim were just as likely to experience a high fever and to be admitted to the hospital as those who did not, even though the drug artificially inflated their white blood cell counts.  This study leaves open the possibility that filgrastim may still be appropriate for patients who have symptoms of infection, or at times other than shortly after cladribine treatment.

Although hairy cells are technically long-lived, instead of rapidly dividing, some late-stage patients are treated with '''broad-spectrum chemotherapy agents''' such as [[methotrexate]] that are effective at killing rapidly dividing cells.  This is not typically attempted unless all other options have been exhausted and it is typically unsuccessful.

==Prognosis==

===Treatment success===
More than 95% of new patients are treated well or at least adequately by cladribine or pentostatin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Else M, Ruchlemer R, Osuji N, ''et al.'' |title=Long remissions in hairy cell leukemia with purine analogs: a report of 219 patients with a median follow-up of 12.5 years |journal=Cancer |volume=104 |issue=11 |pages=2442–8 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16245328 |doi=10.1002/cncr.21447}}</ref>  A majority of new patients can expect a disease-free remission time span of about ten years, or sometimes much longer after taking one of these drugs just once.  If re-treatment is necessary in the future, the drugs are normally effective again, although the average length of remission is somewhat shorter in subsequent treatments.

As with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mutations in the [[IGHV]] on hairy cells are associated with better responses to initial treatments and with prolonged survival.<ref>{{cite journal

How soon after treatment a patient feels "normal" again depends on several factors, including:
*how advanced the disease was at the time of treatment;
*the patient's underlying health status;
*whether the patient had a "complete response" or only a partial response to the treatment;
*whether the patient experienced any of the rare, but serious side effects such as kidney failure;
*how aggressive the individual's disease is;
*whether the patient is experiencing unusual psychological trauma from the "cancer" diagnosis; and
*how the patient perceived his or her pre-treatment energy level and daily functioning.

===Lifespan===
With appropriate treatment, the overall projected lifespan for patients is normal or near-normal.  In all patients, the first two years after diagnosis have the highest risk for fatal outcome; generally, surviving five years predicts good control of the disease.  After five years' clinical remission, patients with normal blood counts can often qualify for private life insurance with some companies.<ref>http://www.euclidmanagers.com/downloads/legrev/rblegrev/RTBaugust.pdf</ref>

Accurately measuring survival for patients with the variant form of the disease (HCL-V) is complicated by the relatively high median age (70 years old) at diagnosis.  However, HCL-V patients routinely survive for more than 10 years, and younger patients can likely expect a long life.

Worldwide, approximately 300 HCL patients per year are expected to die.<ref>http://www.cambridgeantibody.com/home/glossary</ref>  Some of these patients were diagnosed with HCL due to a serious illness that prevented them from receiving initial treatment in time; many others died after living a normal lifespan and experiencing years of good control of the disease.  Perhaps as many as five out of six HCL patients die from some other cause.

===Follow-up care===
Despite decade-long remissions and years of living very normal lives after treatment, hairy cell leukemia is officially considered an incurable disease.  While survivors of solid tumors are commonly declared to be permanently cured after two, three, or five years, people who have hairy cell leukemia are never considered 'cured'.  Relapses of HCL have happened even after more than twenty years of continuous remission.  Patients will require lifelong monitoring and should be aware that the disease can recur even after decades of good health.

People in remission need regular follow-up examinations after their treatment is over.  Most physicians insist on seeing patients at least once a year for the rest of the patient's life, and getting blood counts about twice a year.  Regular follow-up care ensures that patients are carefully monitored, any changes in health are discussed, and new or recurrent cancer can be detected and treated as soon as possible. Between regularly scheduled appointments, people who have hairy cell leukemia should report any health problems, especially viral or bacterial infections, as soon as they appear.

HCL patients are also at a slightly higher than average risk for developing a second kind of cancer,  such as colon cancer or lung cancer, at some point during their lives (including before their HCL diagnosis).  This appears to relate best to the number of hairy cells, and not to different forms of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Au WY, Klasa RJ, Gallagher R, Le N, Gascoyne RD, Connors JM |title=Second malignancies in patients with hairy cell leukemia in british columbia: a 20-year experience |journal=Blood |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=1160–4 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9694703 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9694703}}</ref>  On average, patients might reasonably expect to have as much as double the risk of developing another cancer, with a peak about two years after HCL diagnosis and falling steadily after that, assuming that the HCL was successfully treated.  Aggressive surveillance and prevention efforts are generally warranted, although the lifetime odds of developing a second cancer after HCL diagnosis are still less than 50%.

There is also a higher risk of developing an [[autoimmune disease]].<ref name="Wintrobe"/>  Autoimmune diseases may also go into remission after treatment of HCL.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>

==Prevention/Screening==
Because the cause is unknown, no effective preventive measures can be taken.

Because the disease is rare, routine screening is not cost-effective.

==Epidemiology==
This disease is rare, with fewer than 1 in 10,000 people being diagnosed with HCL during their lives.  Men are four to five times more likely to develop hairy cell leukemia than women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pennhealth.com/ency/article/000592.htm |title=Hairy cell leukemia |accessdate=2007-09-07 |work=}}</ref>  In the United States, the annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is approximately 3 cases per 1,000,000 men each year, and 0.6 cases per 1,000,000 women each year.<ref name="Wintrobe"/>

Most patients are white males over the age of 50,<ref name="Wintrobe"/> although it has been diagnosed in at least one teenager.<ref name="pmid11554237">{{cite journal

|doi=10.1093/jnci/djp051}}</ref>  Partly because existing treatments are so successful, the field has attracted very few new researchers.

Three immunotoxin drugs are in Phase II trials at the [[NIH]]'s [[National Cancer Institute]] in the U.S.:  [[BL22]],<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00074048}}</ref> [[HA22]]<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00462189}}</ref> and [[LMB-2]].<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00337311}}</ref>  All of these protein-based drugs combine part of an anti-B cell antibody with a bacterial toxin to kill the cells on internalization.  BL22 and HA22 attack a common protein called CD22, which is present on hairy cells and healthy B cells.  LMB-2 attacks a protein called CD25, which is not present in HCL-variant, so LMB-2 is only useful for patients with HCL-classic or the Japanese variant.  All three of these therapies are available only at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, USA.  While initial results are generally favorable, it is likely to be a number of years before these drugs are available on the market. 

Other clinical trials<ref>For example, trial [http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00412594 NCT00412594] and [http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00923013 NCT00923013]</ref> are studying the effectiveness of cladribine followed by rituximab in eliminating [[Minimal residual disease|residual hairy cells]] that remain after treatment by cladribine or pentostatin.  It is not currently known if the elimination of such residual cells will result in more durable remissions.

The major remaining research questions are identifying the cause of HCL and determining what prevents hairy cells from maturing normally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hairycell.org/content/researchers/unanswered-questions/biology-disease-including-unanswered-questions |title=The Biology of the Disease Including Unanswered Questions &#124; HairyCell.org
