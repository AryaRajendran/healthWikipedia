The '''soft palate''' (also known as '''velum''' or '''muscular palate''') is, in [[mammal]]s, the soft [[biological tissue|tissue]] constituting the back of the roof of the [[mouth]].  The soft palate is distinguished from the [[hard palate]] at the front of the mouth in that it does not contain [[bone]].

==Function==
The soft palate is movable, consisting of [[muscle]] fibers sheathed in [[mucous membrane]]. It is responsible for closing off the [[Respiratory system|nasal passages]] during the act of [[swallowing]], and also for closing off the airway. During sneezing, it protects the nasal passage by diverting a portion of the excreted substance to the mouth.

In [[human]]s, the [[palatine uvula|uvula]] hangs from the end of the soft palate. Research shows that the uvula is not actually involved in snoring processes.  This has been shown through inconsistent results from uvula removal surgery.  Snoring is more closely associated with fat deposition in the [[pharynx]], enlarged tonsils of [[Waldeyer's ring]], or [[deviated septum]] problems.  Touching the uvula or the end of the soft palate evokes a strong [[pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] in most people.

===Speech===
A speech sound made with the middle part of the [[tongue]] (dorsum) touching the soft palate is known as a [[velar consonant]]. 

It is possible for the soft palate to retract and elevate during speech to separate the oral cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity in order to produce the oral speech sounds. If this separation is incomplete, air escapes through the nose, causing speech to be perceived as [[Nasalization|nasal]].

==Muscles of soft palate==
{{main|Muscles of soft palate and fauces}}
*[[Tensor veli palatini]] 
*[[Palatoglossus]]
*[[Palatopharyngeus]] 
*[[Levator veli palatini]]
*[[Musculus uvulae]]

The muscle of the soft palate play important roles in swallowing and breathing.

Levator veli palatani and tensor veli palatani are the two muscles involved in elevating the soft palate during swallowing.

==Pathology==
{{main|Oral pathology}}
Pathology of the soft palate includes [[mucosa]]l lesions such as [[pemphigus vulgaris]], [[herpangina]] and [[migratory stomatitis]],<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0190-9622/PIIS0190962210004883.pdf| format=PDF}}</ref> and [[muscle|muscular]] conditions such as the [[birth defect|congenital]] [[cleft palate]] and [[cleft uvula]].

[[File:Streptococcal pharyngitis.jpg|thumb|Palatal [[petechiae]].]]
[[Petechiae]] on the soft palate are mainly associated with [[streptococcal pharyngitis]],<ref>[http://www.entnet.org/HealthInformation/tonsillitis.cfm Fact Sheet: Tonsillitis] from American Academy of Otolaryngology. "Updated 1/11". Retrieved November 2011</ref> and as such it is an uncommon but highly [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] finding.<ref name=Review06>{{cite journal |author=Brook I, Dohar JE |title=Management of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis in children |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=S1–11; quiz S12 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17137534 |doi= |url=}}</ref> 10 to 30 percent of palatal petechiae cases are estimated to be caused by suction, which can be habitual or secondary to [[fellatio]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=EaIieB9kX_gC&pg=PA134 Page 134] in: {{cite book |author=Michael Glick; Greenberg, Martin Harry; Burket, Lester W. |title=Burket's oral medicine: diagnosis & treatment |publisher=BC Decker |location=Hamilton, Ont |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=1-55009-186-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Quantitative Properties, Modeling==

Within the microstructure of the soft palate, lie a variety of of complexly oriented fibers that create a nonuniform surface with a nonuniform density distribution. The tissue has been characterized as viscoelastic, nonlinear, and anisotropic in the direction of the fibers. Young modulus values range from 585Pa at the posterior free edge of the soft palate to 1409Pa where the soft palate attaches to the maxilla. <ref>{{cite journal | author= Birch M.J., Srodon | title= Biomechanical Properties of the Human Soft Palate| journal= The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal| volume=46 | issue=3 |pages=268-274| year= 2009}}</ref>These properties are useful when quantifying the effects of corrective orthopedic devices such as the Hotz Plate on cleft lip. 

Quantitative analyses have been done on bilateral and unilateral cleft palate to better understand geometric differences in cleft palate throughout the course of its development and correction. <ref>{{cite journal | author= Berkowitz S, Krischer J, Pruzansky S | title=Quantitative Analysis of Cleft Palate Casts | journal= The Cleft Palate Journal| volume=11 | pages=136-161|  year=1974 |month April= |}}</ref>Despite the difficulty in finding common, comparable landmarks between normal soft palates and cleft palates, analytical methods have been done to assess differences in degree of curvature of the alveolar crest, 2-dimmensional and 3-dimmensional surface area, and slope of the alveolar crest. 

Finite element analysis has demonstrated effective modeling of soft-palate extension and movement.  It has also been an effective tool for evaluating the craniofacial effects of corrective orthopedic devices and cleft lip.
