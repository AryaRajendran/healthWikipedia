'''Female infertility''' refers to [[infertility]] in female humans.

==Definition==
There is no unanimous definition of female infertility, but [[NICE guidelines]] state that: "A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner."<ref name=nice2013>Section "Defining infertility" in: [http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems]. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]] CG156 - Issued: February 2013</ref> It is recommended that a consultation with a [[fertility specialist]] should be made earlier if the woman is aged 36 years or over, or there is a known clinical cause of infertility or a history of predisposing factors for infertility.<ref name=nice2013/>

==Causes and factors==
Causes or factors of female infertility can basically be classified regarding whether they are [[Acquired disorder|acquired]] or genetic, or strictly by location.

===Acquired versus genetic===
Although causes (or factors) of female infertility can be classified as acquired versus genetic, female infertility is usually more or less a combination of [[nature and nurture]]. Also, the presence of any single [[risk factor]] of female infertility (such as smoking, mentioned further below) does not necessarily cause infertility, and even if a woman is definitely infertile then the infertility cannot definitely be blamed on any single risk factor even if the risk factor is (or has been) present.

====Acquired====
According to the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] (ASRM), Age, Smoking, Sexually Transmitted Infections, and Being Overweight or Underweight can all affect fertility.<ref>http://www.fertilityfaq.org/_pdf/magazine1_v4.pdf</ref>

In broad sense, acquired factors practically include any factor that is not based on a [[genetic mutation]], including any [[Environmental toxins and fetal development|intrauterine exposure to toxins during fetal development]], which may present as infertility many years later as an adult.

=====Age=====
{{Main|Age and female fertility}}
A woman's fertility is affected by her age. The average age of a girl's first period ([[menarche]]) is 12-13 (12.5 years in the [[United States]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}</ref> 12.72 in [[Canada]],<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21110899</ref> 12.9 in the [[UK]]<ref>http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf</ref>), but, in postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are [[anovulatory]] in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year.<ref name="Apter D 1980 107–20">{{cite journal |author=Apter D |title=Serum steroids and pituitary hormones in female puberty: a partly longitudinal study |journal=Clinical Endocrinology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=107–20 |year=1980 |month=February |pmid=6249519 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.1980.tb02125.x}}</ref>  A woman's fertility peaks in the early and mid twenties, after which it starts to decline, with this decline being accelerated after age 35. However, the exact estimates of the chances of a woman to conceive after a certain age are not clear, with research giving differing results. The chances of a couple to successfully conceive at an advanced age depend on many factors, including the general health of a woman and the fertility of the male partner.

=====Tobacco smoking=====
{{See also|Women and smoking#Unique gender differences and health effects for Females}}
[[Tobacco smoking]] is harmful to the ovaries, and the degree of damage is dependent upon the amount and length of time a woman smokes or is exposed to a smoke-filled environment. Nicotine and other harmful chemicals in cigarettes interfere with the body’s ability to create [[estrogen]], a hormone that regulates [[folliculogenesis]] and [[ovulation]]. Also, cigarette smoking interferes with folliculogenesis, embryo transport, endometrial receptivity, endometrial angiogenesis, uterine blood flow and the uterine myometrium.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq033}}</ref>  Some damage is irreversible, but stopping smoking can prevent further damage.<ref name=asrm-risks>[http://www.protectyourfertility.com/femalerisks.html FERTILITY FACT > Female Risks] By the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).

=====Sexually transmitted disease=====
[[Sexually transmitted disease]]s are a leading cause of infertility. They often display few, if any visible symptoms, with the risk of failing to seek proper treatment in time to prevent decreased fertility.<ref name=asrm-risks/>

=====Body weight and eating disorders=====
Twelve percent of all infertility cases are a result of a woman either being [[underweight]] or [[overweight]]. [[Adipocyte|Fat cells]] produce estrogen,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson LR, Bulun SE |title=Estrogen production and action |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=45 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=S116–24 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11511861 |doi= 10.1067/mjd.2001.117432}}</ref> in addition to the primary [[sex organ]]s. Too much body fat causes production of too much estrogen and the body begins to react as if it is on birth control, limiting the odds of getting pregnant.<ref name=asrm-risks/> Too little body fat causes insufficient production of estrogen and disruption of the [[menstrual cycle]].<ref name=asrm-risks/> Both under and overweight women have irregular cycles in which ovulation does not occur or is inadequate.<ref name=asrm-risks/> Proper nutrition in early life is also a major factor for later fertility.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq048}}</ref>

A study in the US indicated that approximately 20% of infertile women had a past or current eating disorder, which is five times higher than the general lifetime prevalence rate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freizinger M, Franko DL, Dacey M, Okun B, Domar AD |title=The prevalence of eating disorders in infertile women |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 1|pages= 72–8|year=2008 |month=November |pmid=19006795 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.09.055 }}</ref>

A review from 2010 concluded that overweight and obese subfertile women have a reduced probability of successful fertility treatment and their pregnancies are associated with more complications and higher costs. In hypothetical groups of 1000 women undergoing fertility care, the study counted approximately 800 live births for normal weight and 690 live births for overweight and obese anovulatory women. For ovulatory women, the study counted approximately 700 live births for normal weight, 550 live births for overweight and 530 live births for obese women. The increase in cost per live birth in anovulatory overweight and obese women were, respectively, 54 and 100% higher than their normal weight counterparts, for ovulatory women they were 44 and 70% higher, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koning AM, Kuchenbecker WK, Groen H, ''et al.'' |title=Economic consequences of overweight and obesity in infertility: a framework for evaluating the costs and outcomes of fertility care |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=246–54 |year=2010 |pmid=20056674 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp053 }}</ref>

=====Chemotherapy=====
[[Chemotherapy]] poses a high risk of infertility. 

Chemotherapies with high risk of infertility include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil and chlormethine.<ref name=Brydoy>{{cite journal |author=Brydøy M, Fosså SD, Dahl O, Bjøro T |title=Gonadal dysfunction and fertility problems in cancer survivors |journal=Acta Oncol |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=480–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17497315 |doi=10.1080/02841860601166958 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841860601166958}}</ref> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin.<ref name=Brydoy/> On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine and 5-fluorouracil.<ref name=Brydoy/>

Female infertility by chemotherapy appears to be secondary to [[premature ovarian failure]] by loss of [[primordial follicles]].<ref name=Morgan2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms022}}</ref> This loss is not necessarily a direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents, but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.<ref name=Morgan2012/> [[Antral follicle count]] decreases after three series of chemotherapy, whereas [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) reaches menopausal levels after four series.<ref name=Rosendahl/> Other hormonal changes in chemotherapy include decrease in [[inhibin B]] and [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] levels.<ref name=Rosendahl>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.043}}</ref>

Patients may choose between several methods of [[fertility preservation]] prior to chemotherapy, including [[cryopreservation]] of ovarian tissue, oocytes or embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gurgan T, Salman C, Demirol A |title=Pregnancy and assisted reproduction techniques in men and women after cancer treatment |journal=Placenta |volume=29 |issue=Suppl B |pages=152–9 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18790328 |doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2008.07.007 }}</ref>

=====Other factors that can cause acquired infertility=====
*[[Adhesion (medicine)|Adhesions]] secondary to [[surgery]] in the [[peritoneal cavity]] is the leading cause of acquired infertility.<ref name=Broek2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms032}}</ref> A meta-analysis in 2012 came to the conclusion that there is only little evidence for the surgical principle that using less invasive techniques, introducing less foreign bodies or causing less ischemia reduces the extent and severity of adhesions.<ref name=Broek2012/>
*[[Diabetes mellitus]]. A review of type 1 diabetes came to the result that, despite modern treatment, women with diabetes are at increased risk of female infertility, such as reflected by delayed puberty and menarche, menstrual irregularities (especially [[oligomenorrhoea]]), mild [[hyperandrogenism]], [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]], fewer live born children and possibly earlier [[menopause]].<ref name=Codner2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms024}}</ref> Animal models indicate that abnormalities on the molecular level caused by diabetes include defective [[leptin]], [[insulin]] and [[kisspeptin]] signalling.<ref name=Codner2012/>
*Significant [[liver]] or [[kidney]] disease
*[[Thrombophilia]]<ref name="pmid17433901">{{cite journal |author=Middeldorp S |title=Pregnancy failure and heritable thrombophilia |journal=Semin. Hematol. |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=93–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17433901 |doi=10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.01.005}}</ref><ref name="pmid16835215">{{cite journal |author=Qublan HS, Eid SS, Ababneh HA, ''et al.'' |title=Acquired and inherited thrombophilia: implication in recurrent IVF and embryo transfer failure |journal=Hum.

*[[Cannabis smoking]], such as of [[marijuana]] causes disturbances in the [[endocannabinoid system]], potentially causing infertility<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq058 }}</ref>
*Radiation. A dose of 8 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]] or more to the [[ovaries]] generally causes permanent female infertility.<ref>Chapter on Amenorrhea in: {{cite book |author=Bradshaw, Karen D.; Schorge, John O.; Schaffer, Joseph; Lisa M. Halvorson; Hoffman, Barbara G. |title=Williams' Gynecology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-07-147257-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

====Genetic factors====
There are many [[gene]]s wherein [[mutation]] causes female infertility, as shown in table below. Also, there are additional conditions involving female infertility which are believed to be genetic but where no single gene has been found to be responsible, notably [[Mayer-Rokitansky-Küstner-Hauser Syndrome]] (MRKH).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sultan C, Biason-Lauber A, Philibert P |title=Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome: recent clinical and genetic findings |journal=Gynecol Endocrinol |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=8–11 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19165657 |doi=10.1080/09513590802288291 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09513590802288291}}</ref> Finally, an unknown number of genetic mutations cause a state of subfertility, which in addition to other factors such as environmental ones may manifest as frank infertility.

[[Chromosomal abnormality|Chromosomal abnormalities]] causing female infertility include [[Turner syndrome]].

Some of these gene or chromosome abnormalities cause [[intersexuality|intersexed conditions]], such as [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]]

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of infertility begins with a [[medical history]] and [[physical exam]]. The healthcare provider may order tests, including the following:

* Lab tests
** hormone testing, to measure levels of female hormones at certain times during a [[menstrual cycle]]
** day 2 or 3 measure of [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] and [[estrogen]], to assess [[ovarian reserve]]
** measurements of thyroid function<ref name="pmid16842634">{{cite journal |author=Wartofsky L, Van Nostrand D, Burman KD |title=Overt and 'subclinical' hypothyroidism in women |journal=Obstetrical & gynecological survey |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=535–42 |year=2006 |pmid=16842634 |doi=10.1097/01.ogx.0000228778.95752.66}}</ref> (a [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) level of between 1 and 2 is considered optimal for conception)
** measurement of [[progesterone]] in the second half of the cycle to help confirm ovulation

* Examination and imaging
** an [[endometrial]] [[biopsy]], to verify ovulation and inspect the lining of the uterus
** [[laparoscopy]], which allows the provider to inspect the pelvic organs
** [[fertiloscopy]], a relatively new surgical technique used for early diagnosis (and immediate treatment)
** [[Pap smear]], to check for signs of infection
** [[pelvic exam]], to look for abnormalities or [[infection]]
** a postcoital test, which is done soon after [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] to check for problems with sperm surviving in cervical mucous (not commonly used now because of test unreliability)
** special [[X-ray]] tests

There are [[genetic testing]] techniques under development to detect any mutation in genes associated with female infertility.<ref name=Evian2010/>

Diagnosis and treatment of infertility should be made by physicians who are [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] trained as [[reproductive endocrinologist]]s.  Reproductive Endocrinologists are usually Obstetrician-Gynecologists with advanced training in Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility (in North America). These highly educated professionals and qualified physicians treat Reproductive Disorders affecting not only women but also men, children, and teens. 

Prospective patients should note that reproductive endocrinology & infertility medical practices do not see women for general [[maternity care]]. The practice is primarily focused on helping their patients to conceive and to correct any issues related to recurring pregnancy loss.

==Prevention==
Some cases of female infertility may be prevented through identified interventions:
* ''Maintaining a healthy lifestyle.''  Excessive exercise, consumption of [[caffeine]] and [[alcohol]], and [[smoking]] are all associated with decreased fertility.  Eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet, with plenty of fresh [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s (plenty of [[folate]]s), and maintaining a normal weight are associated with better fertility prospects.
* ''Treating or preventing existing diseases.''  Identifying and controlling chronic diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[hypothyroidism]] increases fertility prospects.  Lifelong practice of [[safer sex]] reduces the likelihood that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s will impair fertility; obtaining prompt treatment for sexually transmitted diseases reduces the likelihood that such infections will do significant damage.  Regular [[physical examination]]s (including [[pap smear]]s) help detect early signs of infections or abnormalities.
* ''Not delaying parenthood.''  Fertility does not ultimately cease before menopause, but it starts declining after age 27 and drops at a somewhat greater rate after age 35.<ref name="titleStudy speeds up biological clocks / Fertility rates dip after women hit 27">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/04/30/MN182697.DTL |title=Study speeds up biological clocks / Fertility rates dip after women hit 27 |accessdate=2007-11-21 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Carl T. | last=Hall}}</ref>  Women whose biological mothers had unusual or abnormal issues related to conceiving may be at particular risk for some conditions, such as [[premature menopause]], that can be mitigated by not delaying parenthood.

==Society and culture==

===Social stigma===

Ethnographic research into female infertility within “pronatalist developing societies”<ref>Inhorn, M. C. (2003). "Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt." Social Science & Medicine 
(56): 1837 - 1851.</ref>  has shown that women who are infertile may be stigmatized, reflecting a deep-seated patriarchal belief system. In these societies, the vocation of motherhood is considered to be intrinsically linked to the notion of womanhood, so in effect, a woman’s infertility conflicts with normative concepts of gender identity. The woman’s inability to adopt this “mandatory status”<ref>Inhorn, M. C. (2003). "Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt." Social Science & Medicine 
(56): 1837 - 1851.</ref>  and “gain entrance to the cult of motherhood”<ref>Inhorn, M. C. (2003). "Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt." Social Science & Medicine 
(56): 1837 - 1851.</ref>  often leads to dysfunctional relationships with the in-laws, extended family and community members, culminating in feelings of “isolation, loneliness and despair”.<ref>Inhorn, M. C. (2003). "Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt." Social Science & Medicine 
(56): 1837 - 1851.</ref> Furthermore, this cultural milieu can impact negatively on “marital dynamics”,<ref>Inhorn, M. C. (2003). "Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt." Social Science & Medicine 
(56): 1837 - 1851.</ref> possibly leading to “divorce or polygamous remarriage”.<ref>Inhorn, M. C. (2003). "Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt." Social Science & Medicine 
(56): 1837 - 1851.</ref>
