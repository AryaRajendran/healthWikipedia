'''Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding''' refers to [[hemorrhage]] in the [[upper gastrointestinal tract]].  The anatomic cut-off for upper GI bleeding is the [[ligament of Treitz]], which connects the fourth portion of the [[duodenum]] to the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] near the [[splenic flexure]] of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]].

Upper GI bleeds are considered [[medical emergencies]], and require admission to [[hospital]] for urgent diagnosis and management.  Due to advances in [[proton pump inhibitors|medications]] and [[endoscopy]], upper GI hemorrhage is now usually treated without surgery.

==Presentation==
Patients with upper GI hemorrhage often present with [[hematemesis]], [[coffee ground vomiting]], [[melena]],  or [[hematochezia]] (maroon coloured stool) if the hemorrhage is severe.  The presentation of bleeding depends on the amount and location of hemorrhage.

Patients may also present with complications of [[anemia]], including chest pain, [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and shortness of breath.

The [[physical examination]] performed by the [[physician]] concentrates on the following things:
*[[Vital signs]], in order to determine the severity of bleeding and the timing of intervention
*[[Abdomen|Abdominal]] and [[rectum|rectal]] examination, in order to determine possible causes of hemorrhage
*Assessment for [[portal hypertension]] and [[cirrhosis|stigmata of chronic liver disease]] in order to determine if the bleeding is from a variceal source.

Laboratory findings include [[anemia]], [[coagulopathy]], and an elevated [[BUN-to-creatinine ratio]].

==Causes==
[[Image:MALT 4.jpg|thumb|Gastric ulcer in [[antrum]] of [[stomach]] with overlying clot.  Pathology was consistent with [[gastric lymphoma]].]]
A number of medications increase the risk of bleeding including [[NSAIDs]] and [[SSRIs]]. [[SSRIs]] double the rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/search/GFDSearch.asp?itemNum=12057&ContType=HDA |title=Are SSRIs associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults?
 |format= |work=Global Family Doctor |accessdate=}}</ref>

There are many causes for upper GI hemorrhage.  Causes are usually anatomically divided into their location in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

People are usually stratified into having either [[esophageal varices|variceal]] or non-variceal sources of upper GI hemorrhage, as the two have different treatment algorithms and prognosis.  

The causes for upper GI hemorrhage include the following:
*[[Esophagus|Esophageal]] causes:
** [[Esophageal varices]]
** [[Esophagitis]]
** [[Esophageal cancer]]
**Esophageal ulcers
**[[Mallory-Weiss syndrome|Mallory-Weiss tear]]

*[[Stomach|Gastric]] causes:
** [[Gastric ulcer]]
** [[Gastric cancer]]
** [[Gastritis]]
** [[Gastric varices]]
** [[Gastric antral vascular ectasia]]
** [[Dieulafoy's lesion]]s
*[[Duodenum|Duodenal]] causes:
**[[Duodenal ulcer]]
** [[Vascular malformation]], including [[aorto-enteric fistulae]]. Fistulae are usually secondary to prior vascular surgery and usually occur at the proximal anastomosis at the third or fourth portion of the duodenum where it is retroperitoneal and near the aorta.<ref name="pmidpending">{{cite journal |author=Graber CJ |title=A Stitch in Time — A 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease was admitted to the hospital with a several-month history of fevers, chills, and fatigue |journal=New Engl J Med |volume=357 |issue= 10|pages=1029–34 |year=2007|doi=10.1056/NEJMcps062601|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/10/1029 |pmid=17804848 |author-separator=, |display-authors=1 |last2=Lauring |first2=Adam S. |last3=Chin-Hong |first3=Peter V.}}</ref><ref name="pmid12704326">{{cite journal |author=Sierra J, Kalangos A, Faidutti B, Christenson JT |title=Aorto-enteric fistula is a serious complication to aortic surgery.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Gastric ulcer 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|Endoscopic]] image of small [[gastric ulcer]] with visible vessel]]
The diagnosis of upper GI bleeding is assumed when hematemesis is documented. In the absence of hematemesis, an upper source for GI bleeding is likely in the presence of at least two factors among: black stool, age < 50 years, and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio 30 or more.  In the absence of these findings, consider a nasogastric aspirate to determine the source of bleeding. If the aspirate is positive, an upper GI bleed is greater than 50%, but not high enough to be certain. If the aspirate is negative, the source of a GI bleed is likely lower. The accuracy of the aspirate is improved by using the Gastroccult test.

===Diagnostic testing===
Whiting studied a cohort of 325 patients and found the odds ratios for the strongest predictors were: black stool, 16.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.7–35.7); age < 50 years, 8.4 (95% CI, 3.2–22.1); and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio 30 or more, 10.0 (95% CI, 4.0–25.6).<ref name=Witting/> Seven (5%) of 151 with none of these factors had an upper GI tract bleed, versus 63 (93%) of 68 with 2 or 3 factors. Ernst found similar results.<ref name=Ernst1999/>

The nasogastric aspirate can help determine the location of bleeding and thus direct initial diagnostic and treatment plans. Witting found that nasogastric aspirate has sensitivity 42%, specificity 91%, [[negative predictive value]] 64%, positive predictive value 92% and overall accuracy of 66% in differentiating upper GI bleeding from bleeding distal to the [[ligament of Treitz]]{{ref|3}}. Thus, in this study a positive aspirate is more helpful than a negative aspirate. In a smaller study, Cuellar found a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 55%{{ref|4}}, somewhat opposite results from Witting. Cuellar also studied the appearance of the aspirate and a [http://www.eboncall.org/CATs/2190.html summary of these results] is available at the Evidence-Based On-Call database. Although the website lists these results as expired, they were available as of Oct, 16, 2006. These results are also available through the [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.eboncall.org/CATs/2190.html Wayback Archive] and readers may consult the Archive if the original page is removed.

Determining whether blood is in gastric contents, either vomited or aspirated specimens, is surprisingly difficult. Slide tests are based on orthotolidine (Hematest reagent tablets and Bili-Labstix) or guaiac (Hemoccult and Gastroccult). Rosenthal found orthotolidine-based tests more sensitive than specific; the Hemoccult test's sensitivity reduced by the acidic environment; and the Gastroccult test be the most accurate

Holman used simulated gastric specimens and found the Hemoccult test to have significant problems with non-specificy and false-positive results, whereas the Gastroccult test was very accurate
.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holman JS, Shwed JA |title=Influence of sucralfate on the detection of occult blood in simulated gastric fluid by two screening tests |journal=Clin Pharm |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=625–7 |year=1992 |pmid=1617913 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
Holman found that by 120 seconds after the developer was applied, the Hemoccult test was positive on ''all'' control samples.

In a study published regarding a new scoring system called the [[Glasgow-Blatchford]] bleeding score in ''Lancet'' on January 3, 2009, 16% of patients presenting with upper GI bleed had GBS score of "0", considered low. Among these patients there were no deaths or interventions needed and the patients were able to be effectively treated in an outpatient setting.

===Bayesian calculations===
The predictive values cited are based on the prevalences of upper GI bleeding in the corresponding studies. A [http://medinformatics.uthscsa.edu/calculator/ clinical calculator] can be used to generate predictive values for other prevalences.

== Treatment ==
The initial focus is on [[resuscitation]] beginning with airway management and fluid resuscitation using either intravenous fluids and or blood.<ref name=Overall2011>{{cite journal|last=Jairath|first=V|coauthors=Barkun, AN|title=The overall approach to the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.|journal=Gastrointestinal endoscopy clinics of North America|date=2011 Oct|volume=21|issue=4|pages=657–70|pmid=21944416|doi=10.1016/j.giec.2011.07.001}}</ref> A number of medications may improve outcomes depending on the source of the bleeding.<ref name=Overall2011/> After the initial resuscitation has been completed, treatment is instigated to limit the likelihood of rebleeds and correct any anaemia that the bleeding may have caused.

===Peptic ulcers===
Based on evidence from people with other health problems [[Crystalloid solution|crystalloid]] and [[Volume_expander#Colloids|colloids]] are believed to be equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding.<ref name=Overall2011/> [[Proton pump inhibitor]]s may reduce mortality in those with severe disease as well as the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group.<ref name=PPI2007>{{cite journal|last=Leontiadis|first=GI|coauthors=Sreedharan, A, Dorward, S, Barton, P, Delaney, B, Howden, CW, Orhewere, M, Gisbert, J, Sharma, VK, Rostom, A, Moayyedi, P, Forman, D|title=Systematic reviews of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors in acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.|journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)|date=2007 Dec|volume=11|issue=51|pages=iii–iv, 1–164|pmid=18021578}}</ref> In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sreedharan|first=A|coauthors=Martin, J, Leontiadis, GI, Dorward, S, Howden, CW, Forman, D, Moayyedi, P|title=Proton pump inhibitor treatment initiated prior to endoscopic diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2010-07-07|issue=7|pages=CD005415|pmid=20614440|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005415.pub3|editor1-last=Sreedharan|editor1-first=Aravamuthan}}</ref> The evidence for the inhibition of fibrinolysis with [[tranexamic acid]] is insufficient to recommend it use.<ref name=Overall2011/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gluud|first=LL|coauthors=Klingenberg, SL, Langholz, E|title=Tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012-01-18|volume=1|pages=CD006640|pmid=22258969|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006640.pub2|editor1-last=Gluud|editor1-first=Lise Lotte}}</ref> But the evidence is promising.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gluud|first=LL|coauthors=Klingenberg, SL, Langholz, SE|title=Systematic review: tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics|date=2008 May|volume=27|issue=9|pages=752–8|pmid=18248659|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03638.x}}</ref> [[Somatostatin]] and [[octreotide]] while recommended for varicial bleeding have not been found to be of general use for non varicial bleeds.<ref name=Overall2011/>

===Variceal bleeding===
For initial fluid replacement colloids or [[albumin]] is preferred in people with cirrhosis.<ref name=Overall2011/> Medications typically includes [[octreotide]] or if not available [[vasopression]] and [[nitroglycerin]] to reduce portal pressures.<ref name=N2010>{{cite journal|last=Cat|first=TB|coauthors=Liu-DeRyke, X|title=Medical management of variceal hemorrhage|journal=Critical care nursing clinics of North America|date=2010 Sep|volume=22|issue=3|pages=381–93|pmid=20691388|doi=10.1016/j.ccell.2010.02.004}}</ref> This is typically in addition to [[Therapeutic endoscopy|endoscopic banding]] or [[sclerotherapy]] for the varicies.<ref name=N2010/> If this is sufficient then [[beta blockers]] and [[nitrates]] may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding.<ref name=N2010/> If bleeding continues then balloon tamponade with a [[Sengstaken-Blakemore tube]] or [[Minnesota tube]] may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varicies.<ref name=N2010/> This may then be followed by a [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]].<ref name=N2010/>

===Blood products===
If large amounts of pack red blood cells are used additional [[platelets]] and [[fresh frozen plasma]] should be administered to prevent [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]].<ref name=Overall2011/> Some evidence supports holding off on blood transfusions in those who have a [[hemoglobin]] greater than 7 to 8 g/dL and only moderate bleeding.<ref name=Overall2011/><ref name="transfusions">{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1211801|pmid=23281973|title=Transfusion Strategies for Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding|year=2013|last1=Villanueva|first1=Càndid|last2=Colomo|first2=Alan|last3=Bosch|first3=Alba|last4=Concepción|first4=Mar|last5=Hernandez-Gea|first5=Virginia|last6=Aracil|first6=Carles|last7=Graupera|first7=Isabel|last8=Poca|first8=María|last9=Alvarez-Urturi|first9=Cristina|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=368|pages=11–21|issue=1}}</ref> If the INR is greater than 1.5 to 1.8 correction with fresh frozen plasma, [[prothrombin complex]] may decrease mortality.<ref name=Overall2011/>

===Procedures===
[[Image:GU with clip.jpg|right|thumb|The above ulcer seen after endoscopic clipping]]
The benefits verses risks of placing a [[nasogastric tube]] in those with upper GI bleeding are not determined.<ref name=Overall2011/> Endoscopy within 24&nbsp;hours is recommended.<ref name=Overall2011/> Prokinetic agents such as [[erythromycin]] before endocopy can decrease the amount of blood in the stomach and thus improve the operators view.<ref name=Overall2011/> Early endoscopy decreases hospital time and the amount of blood transfusions needed.<ref name=Overall2011/> Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found.<ref name=Overall2011/> It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72&nbsp;hours.<ref name=Overall2011/>
Blood is not recommended to correct anaemia, unless the patient is cardiovascularly unstable as this can worsen outcomes.<ref name="transfusions"/> Oral iron can be used, but this can lead to problems with compliance, tolerance, darkening stools which may mask evidence of rebleeds and tends to be slow, especially if used in conjunction with PPIs. [[Parenteral]] Iron is increasingly used in these cases to improve patient outcomes and void blood usage.

==Epidemiology==
About 75% of patients presenting to the emergency room with GI bleeding have an upper source
