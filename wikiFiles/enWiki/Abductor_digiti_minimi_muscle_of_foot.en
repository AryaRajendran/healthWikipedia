The '''abductor digiti minimi''' ('''abductor minimi digiti''', '''abductor digiti quinti''') is a muscle which lies along the [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|lateral]] (outer) border of the [[foot]],<ref name=GrayStudent>{{cite book |last=Drake |first=Richard L.  |last2=Vogl |first2=A. Wayne |last3=Mitchell|first3=Adam W. M.| year=2010 |title=Gray´s Anatomy for Students |edition=2nd | isbn =978-0-443-06952-9|pages=618–619}}</ref> and is in relation by its [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|medial]] margin with the [[lateral plantar artery]], [[lateral plantar vein|vein]] and [[Lateral plantar nerve|nerves]].

It homolog in the arm is the [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle of hand|abductor digiti minimi muscle in the hand]].

==Origin and insertion==
It arises, by a broad origin, from the lateral process of the tuberosity of the [[calcaneus]], from the under surface of the calcaneus between the two processes of the tuberosity, from the forepart of the medial process, from the plantar [[aponeurosis]], and from the [[intermuscular septum]] between it and the [[flexor digitorum brevis]].<ref name=Gray>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/131.html |title=Gray, Henry. 1918. Anatomy of the Human Body |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

Its tendon, after gliding over a smooth facet on the under surface of the base of the [[fifth metatarsal bone]], is inserted, with the [[Flexor digiti quinti brevis muscle (foot)|flexor digiti quinti brevis]], into the fibular side of the base of the first [[Phalanx bones|phalanx]] of the [[fifth toe]].<ref name="Gray" />

==Innervation==
The abductor digiti minimi is innervated by the [[lateral plantar nerve]], a branch of the [[tibial nerve]].

==Function==
Its function is [[flexion]]<ref name=Bojsen364-367>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=364–367 |accessdate=Marts 1, 2012}}</ref>   and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]] of the [[fifth toe|fifth (little) toe]] at the [[Metatarsophalangeal articulations|metatarsophalangeal joint]].<ref name="Gray" /><ref name="Bojsen364-367" />

==Clinical relevance==
Due to its role in posture during all physical activity while in an upright position, the abductor digiti minimi is often the target of injury. The most common of such injuries occurs mainly in women and is referred to as orteil de belette, commonly known as [[Weasel Toe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In case of [[polydactyly]] it may insert to the sixth toe instead, if there is one.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Etymology==
The Latin name abductor digiti minimi translates to ''abductor of the small digit'' while the alternative name abductor digiti quinti means ''abductor of fifth digit''.
