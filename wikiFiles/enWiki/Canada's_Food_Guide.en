Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide was developed for Canadians and is accessible for all Canadians.  It includes guidelines for eating the right food groups, specified by age group and gender. There are also tips for which foods to choose, the servings size of each food and the best cooking methods. Also included are tips for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and body weight with physical activity.

==History==
Canada's first food guide was introduced in July 1942 to provide guidance to Canadians on proper nutrition during a period of time when wartime rations were common. The 1942 version was called the Official Food Rules. In 1944 the guide was revised and renamed Canada's Food Rules. In 1962, the guidelines were revised and renamed to Canada's Food Guide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/context/hist-eng.php |title=History of Canada's Food Guide |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2007-02-05 |accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref>

==Food groups==
Canada's Food Guide has four [[food group]]s. These include:
* [[Vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]
* [[Grain product]]s
* [[Milk]] and alternatives
* [[Meat]] and alternatives

Any foods not accurately described by these food groups are deemed "other" and are advised to be consumed in moderation.

===Vegetables and fruit===
The Vegetable and Fruit arc on the Canada's Food Guide label is the largest,
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/fruit/index-eng.php |title=Vegetables and Fruit - Canada's Food Guide |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> and individuals are advised that most of their food consumption be from this food group. Vegetables and fruits are known to contain many beneficial substances such as [[flavonoids]], which may help remove [[carcinogens]] from the body, as well as [[antioxidants]] such as [[vitamin C]] and [[beta carotene]], which help prevent oxidation damage by [[free radicals]]. A diet that includes a variety of vegetables and fruit can help reduce the risk of some types of [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000282230000420X |title=Elsevier |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref>  Consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables is recommended by the guide.

===Grain products===
Grain products are essential to the diet. They provide [[carbohydrates]] for energy and whole grain products can be a source of fibre and are typically low in fat. Whole grain products can be rich sources of many nutrients that help in disease prevention, such as [[dietary fibre]], [[B vitamins]], [[selenium]], [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[phytochemicals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002822301001948 |title=Elsevier |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> Eating a "diet rich in whole grains could also help reduce the risk of heart disease".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/grain-cereal/index-eng.php |title=Grain Products - Canada's Food Guide |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref>

===Milk and alternatives===
According to Canada's Food Guide, milk and alternatives are essential to the body to maintain bone health. This food group includes milk and dairy products such as [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[cream]], [[kefir]] and fortified [[soy]] beverages.<ref name="inspection1">{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch7-1e.shtml |title=Canadian Food Inspection Agency - Guide to Food Labelling and Advertising - Chapter 7 - Nutrient Content Claims - Annexes 7-1 and 7-2 |publisher=Inspection.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> Canadian milk and many milk products are required to be fortified with [[Vitamin D]]. This helps Canadians get their daily recommended intake of Vitamin D if they consume the adequate amount of milk and alternatives each day.<ref name="inspection1"/>

===Meat and alternatives===
Meat and alternatives are a source of [[protein]] in the diet. This group includes animal meat sources as well as alternatives such as [[Nuts (meat)|nuts]] and [[lentils]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/meat-viande/index-eng.php |title=Meat and Alternatives - Canada's Food Guide |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> Meat and alternatives are also a source of [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[B vitamin]]s. This is the smallest arc on Canada's Food Guide ribbon, meaning that only a few servings from this group will satisfy the nutritional requirements of an individual.

===Other===

====Oils and fats====
"Include a small amount - 30 to 45 mL (2 to 3 Tbsp) - of unsaturated fat each day to get the fat you need".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/oil-huile/oil-huile-eng.php |title=What Type and Amount of Fat Do I Need? - Canada's Food Guide |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref>

Unsaturated vegetable oils include [[Canola#Canola oil|canola oil]], [[corn oil]], [[flaxseed oil]], [[olive oil]], [[peanut oil]], [[soybean oil]], and [[sunflower oil]].

====Beverages====
The guide recommends [[water]] as the primary beverage. It is a calorie-free, fat-free, sugar-free thirst quencher that is essential to the body's metabolic functions. Consumption of water should increase with temperature or an individual's physical activity. The guide also recommends avoiding beverages with added sugar or fat. Caffeinated beverages, unpasteurized fruit juices and energy drinks should only be consumed in moderation.

==Canada's Food Guide First Nations, Inuit and Métis==
