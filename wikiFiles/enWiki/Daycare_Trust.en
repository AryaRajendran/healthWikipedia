'''Daycare Trust''' is the [[UK]]'s national childcare charity, campaigning for quality, accessible, affordable childcare for all, and raising the voices of children, parents and carers. Daycare Trust advises parents and carers, providers, employers, trade unions and policymakers on childcare issues. 

Daycare Trust was established in 1986 and is headquartered in London. It is a registered charity and company.

== History ==
The concept for Daycare Trust emerged in the 1970s in the context of the growing [[feminist]] movement. Many women desired both a family and a work life, but the childcare infrastructure was not in place. Additionally, the [[1948 Children Act]] stigmatised parents for "dumping" their children in nurseries, categorising those children as "at risk" and "maternally deprived."

Activists, mostly women, from various organisations campaigned to establish nurseries in various places, primarily in colleges and universities. From there they tackled the issue of quality, and campaigned for better professional training.

In 1986, a group of these activists established Daycare Trust, creating a unified base of support to carry out the charitable work of the [[National Childcare Campaign]] (a coalition of local groups formed in 1980 to campaign for workplace nurseries and better staff training).

=== 1986, year of establishment ===
*Public provision of childcare was discouraged by the lack of funding – tax relief on employer supported childcare was removed and local authority funding was cut – and private nurseries were flourishing (59,000 nursery places in 1990).
*By 1986/7, 47.5% of under fives were in early education.
*[[Family Income Supplement]], the main source of state financial support for families, did not target any help specifically to childcare costs, and there was no regulation/guidance for the childcare workforce.

=== Today ===
*There are more than 1.5 million childcare places registered with Ofsted (March 2009).
*3,500 children’s centres have been established in communities across the country offering services to 2.7 million children under five and their families.
*All three- and four-year-olds are entitled to free early years education for up to 15 hours per week for 38 weeks per year – an offer taken up by 92% of the three year old population and 98% of the four year old population. 
*The [[Childcare Act 2006]] places duties on local authorities to provide sufficient childcare for working parents in their area and to make sure that parents have access to information about childcare.
*The [[Early Years Foundation Stage]] sets standards for workforce training and qualifications
*Many parents can claim help with their childcare costs from a range of schemes including tax credits.
*Parents can search for childcare places through their local family information service. Local family information services can be found using [[Directgov]]

# Extend free places to ensure that all children benefit from early childhood education and care
# Extend parental leave and make workplaces family-friendly
# Fill the gaps in provision and guarantee extended schools
# Make childcare affordable for all parents
# Celebrate [[Sure Start]] Children’s Centres and extend the range of services on offer
