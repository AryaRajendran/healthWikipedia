'''Sulfonamide''' or '''sulphonamide''' is the basis of several groups of drugs. The original antibacterial sulfonamides (sometimes called '''sulfa drugs''' or '''sulpha drugs''') are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain the [[Sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] group. Some sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity, e.g., the [[anticonvulsant]] [[sultiame]]. The [[sulfonylurea]]s and [[thiazide diuretics]] are newer drug groups based on the antibacterial sulfonamides.<ref>http://chemicalland21.com/info/SULFONAMIDE%20CLASS%20ANTIBIOTICS.htm</ref>

Sulfa allergies are common,<ref name="allergies.about.com">http://allergies.about.com/od/medicationallergies/a/sulfa.htm</ref> hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully. It is important to make a distinction between sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives, such as sulfates and sulfites, which are chemically unrelated to the sulfonamide group, and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions seen in the sulfonamides.

==Function==
===Antimicrobial===
{{Main|Dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitor}}
In [[bacteria]], antibacterial sulfonamides act as [[competitive inhibitor]]s of the enzyme [[dihydropteroate synthetase|dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS)]], an enzyme involved in [[folate synthesis]]. As such, the microorganism will be "starved" of folate and die.<ref>Michael Kent, ''Advanced Biology,'' Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 46 ISBN 978-0-19-914195-1</ref>
[[File:Sulfa folate.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Structural similarity between sulfonamide (left) and PABA (center) is the basis for the inhibitory activity of sulfa drugs on dihydrofolate (right) biosynthesis]]
Humans, in contrast to bacteria, acquire [[folate]] (vitamin B<sub>9</sub>) through the diet.

===Other uses===
The sulfonamide chemical moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including [[thiazide]] [[diuretic]]s (including [[hydrochlorothiazide]], [[metolazone]], and [[indapamide]], among others), loop diuretics (including [[furosemide]], [[bumetanide]], and [[torsemide]]), [[sulfonylureas]] (including [[glipizide]], [[glyburide]], among others), and some [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s (e.g., [[celecoxib]]), and [[acetazolamide]].

[[Sulfasalazine]], in addition to its use as an antibiotic, is also used in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].

==History==
Sulfonamide drugs were the first antimicrobial drugs, and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine. The first sulfonamide, trade-named [[Prontosil]], was a [[prodrug]]. Experiments with Prontosil began in 1932 in the laboratories of [[Bayer]] AG, at that time a component of the huge German chemical trust [[IG Farben]]. The Bayer team believed that [[Aniline#History|coal-tar dyes]] able to preferentially bind to bacteria and parasites might be used to target harmful organisms in the body. After years of fruitless trial-and-error work on hundreds of dyes, a team led by physician/researcher [[Gerhard Domagk]] (working under the general direction of Farben executive [[Heinrich Hörlein]]) finally found one that worked: a red dye synthesized by Bayer chemist [[Josef Klarer]] that had remarkable effects on stopping some bacterial infections in mice.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=S32TrACJa6kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=demon+under+the+microscope#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = The Demon Under the Microscope: From Battlefield Hospitals to Nazi Labs, One Doctor's Heroic Search for the World's First Miracle Drug | isbn = 978-0-307-35228-6 | author1 = Hager | first1 = Thomas | date = 2006-09-01}}</ref> The first official communication about the breakthrough discovery was not published until 1935, more than two years after the drug was patented by Klarer and his research partner Fritz Mietzsch. Prontosil, as Bayer named the new drug, was the first medicine ever discovered that could effectively treat a range of bacterial infections inside the body. It had a strong protective action against infections caused by [[streptococcus|streptococci]], including blood infections, childbed fever, and [[erysipelas]], and a lesser effect on infections caused by other cocci. However, it had no effect at all in the test tube, exerting its antibacterial action only in live animals. Later, it was discovered by [[Daniel Bovet|Bovet]],<ref>Cf. Daniel Bovet, ''Une chimie qui guérit : Histoire de la découverte des sulfamides'', Paris, Payot, coll. « Médecine et sociétés », 1988 (ISBN 2-228-88108-2).</ref> [[Federico Nitti|Nitti]] and J. and Th. [[Jacques Tréfouël|Tréfouël]], a French research team led by [[Ernest Fourneau]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]], that the drug was metabolized into two pieces inside the body, releasing from the inactive dye portion a smaller, colorless, active compound called [[sulfanilamide]].<ref>J. et Th. Tréfouël, F. Nitti et D. Bovet, « Activité du p.aminophénylsulfamide sur l’infection streptococcique expérimentale de la souris et du lapin », dans ''C. R. Soc. Biol.'', vol. 120, 23 novembre 1935, p. 756.</ref> The discovery helped establish the concept of "bioactivation" and dashed the German corporation's dreams of enormous profit; the active molecule sulfanilamide (or sulfa) had first been synthesized in 1906 and was widely used in the dye-making industry; its patent had since expired and the drug was available to anyone.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/372460/history-of-medicine/35670/Sulfonamide-drugs</ref>

The result was a sulfa craze.<ref>http://blogofbad.wordpress.com/2009/02/09/bad-health-elixir-sulfanilamide/</ref> For several years in the late 1930s, hundreds of manufacturers produced tens of thousands of tons of myriad forms of sulfa. This and nonexistent testing requirements led to the [[elixir sulfanilamide]] disaster in the fall of 1937, during which at least 100 people were poisoned with [[diethylene glycol]]. This led to the passage of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] in 1938. As the first and only effective antibiotic available in the years before [[penicillin]], sulfa drugs continued to thrive through the early years of [[World War II]].<ref>http://home.att.net/~steinert/wwii.htm#The%20Use%20of%20Sulfanilamide%20in%20World%20War%20II</ref> They are credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of patients, including [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr.]] (son of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]) (in 1936) and [[Winston Churchill]]. Sulfa had a central role in preventing wound infections during the war. American soldiers were issued a [[first-aid kit]] containing sulfa pills and powder, and were told to sprinkle it on any open wound.

The sulfanilamide compound is more active in the [[protonated]] form.<!-- anil-SO2H<sub>3</sub>(+) is the protonated form? Or the neutral form? Later sentences suggest the problem is deprotonation (discusses pka) of the neutral form so the neutral (NH<sub>2</sub) is the "protonated form" related to it). --> The solubility of the drug is very low and sometimes can crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pK<sub>a</sub> of around 10. This is a very painful experience, so patients are told to take the medication with copious amounts of water. Newer analogous compounds prevent this complication because they have a lower pK<sub>a</sub>, around 5–6,{{cn|date=May 2012}}<!-- uncited overall, and no specific examples to allow verification --> making them more likely to remain in a soluble form.

Many thousands of molecules containing the sulfanilamide structure have been created since its discovery (by one account, over 5,400 permutations by 1945), yielding improved formulations with greater effectiveness and less toxicity. Sulfa drugs are still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections, and are receiving renewed interest for the treatment of infections caused by bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.

==Preparation==

Sulfonamides are prepared by the reaction of a sulfonyl chloride with ammonia or an amine.
Certain sulfonamides (sulfadiazine or [[sulfamethoxazole]]) are sometimes mixed with the drug [[trimethoprim]], which acts against [[dihydrofolate reductase]].

==Side effects==
[[File:Stevens-johnson-syndrome.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Patient suffering from [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]]]
Sulfonamides have the potential to cause a variety of untoward reactions, including urinary tract disorders, haemopoietic disorders, [[porphyria]], and hypersensitivity reactions. When used in large doses, they may cause a strong allergic reaction. Two of the most serious are [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (also known as Lyell syndrome).<ref name="allergies.about.com"/>

Approximately 3% of the general population have adverse reactions when treated with sulfonamide antimicrobials. Of note is the observation that patients with [[HIV]] have a much higher prevalence, at about 60%.<ref name=SMJ>

Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides. <ref name=Knowles>

It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy'). <ref name=WAMSG>

Two regions of the sulfonamide antibiotic chemical structure are implicated in the hypersensitivity reactions associated with the class.
* The first is the N1 heterocyclic ring, which causes a type I [[hypersensitivity]] reaction.
* The second is the N4 amino nitrogen that, in a stereospecific process, forms reactive metabolites that cause either direct cytotoxicity or immunologic response.

The nonantibiotic sulfonamides lack both of these structures.<ref name=Cross>

The most common manifestations of a [[hypersensitivity]] reaction to sulfa drugs are rash and hives.  However, there are several life-threatening manifestations of hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs, including [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], and [[fulminant hepatic necrosis]], among others.<ref name=Harrison's>
