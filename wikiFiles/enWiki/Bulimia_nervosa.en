'''Bulimia nervosa''' is an [[eating disorder]] characterized by [[binge eating]] and purging, or consuming a large amount of food in a short amount of time followed by an attempt to rid oneself of the food consumed (purging), typically by [[vomiting]], taking a [[laxative]] or [[diuretic]], and/or excessive exercise, because of an extensive concern for body weight.<ref name = Hay>{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=Phillipa J|title=Bulimia Nervosa|journal=Clinical Evidence|date=19|year=2010|month=July|pmid=PMC3275326}}</ref>

The overwhelming majority (90–95 percent) of individuals with bulimia are women.<ref name=BarlowDurand/> Males do develop the disorder. However, they have a slightly later age of onset, and males with bulimia are more likely to have disturbances in the development of their identity with a greater tendency towards sexual inhibition in the context of heterosexuality, apparent asexuality, manifest homosexuality, or bisexuality. Males that participate in sports that require weight regulation, such as wrestling and horse racing, comprise another large group of males with eating disorders.
Among women, adolescents are the most at risk. A survey of 496 adolescent girls reported that more than 12 percent experienced some form of eating disorder by the time they were 20. Anorexia and bulimia are the most culturally specific psychological disorders yet identified, and for many young women, looking good for their social life is much more important than being healthy. Self-worth, happiness, and success are largely determined by body measurements and percentage of body fat for young women. 
Over the years the size and weight of the average woman has increased with improved nutrition. Over the years there has also been an increased message from the media to be thin. The media projects a thin-ideal rather than a healthy-ideal, and this causes women and young girls to work toward having a thin body even if it means purging.<ref name=BarlowDurand>Barlow, D.

==Symptoms==
These cycles often involve rapid and out-of-control eating, which may stop when the bulimic is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension, followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging.

Bulimia also has negative effects on the sufferer's dental health due to the acid passed through the mouth from frequent vomiting causing acid erosion, mainly on the posterior dental surface.

==Diagnosis==
The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence, between 13 and 20 years of age, and many cases have previously suffered obesity, with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic binging and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shader |first=Richard I. |title=Manual of Psychiatric Therapeutics |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-4459-8}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1% of young woman and after 10 years of diagnosis, half will recover fully, a third will recover partially, and 10-20% will still have symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hay PJ, Bacaltchuk J |title=Bulimia nervosa |journal=Clin Evid (Online) |volume=2008 |year=2008 |pmid=19450294 |pmc=2907970 |url=http://www.clinicalevidence.bmj.com/ceweb/pmc/2008/06/1009}}</ref>

Adolescents with bulimia nervosa are more likely to have self-imposed perfectionism and compulsivity issues in eating compared to their peers.

There are two sub-types of bulimia nervosa:
* '''Purging type''' bulimics self-induce [[vomiting]] (usually by triggering the [[gag reflex]] or ingesting [[emetic]]s such as [[syrup of ipecac]]) to rapidly remove food from the body before it can be digested, or use  [[laxatives]], [[diuretics]], or [[enemas]].
* '''Non-purging type''' bulimics (approximately 6–8% of cases) exercise or fast excessively after a binge to offset the caloric intake after eating. Purging-type bulimics may also exercise or fast, but as a secondary form of weight control.<ref name="durand">{{Cite book|first1=David H. |last1=Barlow |first2=Vincent Mark |last2=Durand |title=Abnormal psychology: an integrative approach |publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning |location=Belmont, CA |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-534-63362-5}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

==Causes==

===Biological===

Like with anorexia nervosa, there is evidence of genetic predispositions contributing to the onset of this eating disorder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biological Causes of Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro98/202s98-paper3/Hirst3.html|accessdate=3 April}}</ref> Abnormal levels of many hormones, notably [[serotonin]], have been shown to be responsible for some disordered eating behaviours.

There is evidence that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women, and the onset of bulimia nervosa.  Studies have shown that women with [[hyperandrogenism]] and [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] have a dysregulation of appetite, along with carbohydrates and fats.  This dysregulation of appetite is also seen in women with bulimia nervosa.  In addition, gene knockout studies in mice have shown that mice that have the gene encoding [[estrogen]] receptors have decreased fertility due to ovarian dysfunction and dysregulation of [[androgen]] receptors.  In humans, there is evidence that there is an association between polymorphisms in the ERβ ([[estrogen receptor]] β) and bulimia, suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hirschberg AL |title=Sex hormones, appetite and eating behaviour in women |journal=Maturitas |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=248–56 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22281161 |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.12.016 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-5122(12)00004-7}}</ref>

Bulimia has been compared to drug addiction, though the empirical support for this characterization is limited.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Striatal dopamine in bulimia nervosa: a PET imaging study.|year=2012|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22331810}}</ref> However, people with bulimia nervosa may share dopamine D2 receptor-related vulnerabilities with those with substance abuse disorders.<ref>{{cite journal|last=H.

===Social===

Media portrayals of an 'ideal' body shape are widely considered to be a contributing factor to bulimia.<ref name=Barker03/> In a 1991 study by Weltzin, Hsu, Pollicle, and Kaye, it was stated that 19% of bulimics undereat, 37% of bulimics eat an amount of food that is normal for an average human being, and 44% of bulimics overeat.<ref>{{cite book |title= Psychology: the science of behaviour-4th Canadian ed|last= Carlson|first= N. |coauthors= Heth C., Miller Harold, Donahoe John, Buskist William, Martin G., Schmaltz Rodney|year= 2007|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location= Toronto, ON|isbn= 978-0-205-64524-4|page=415}}</ref> A survey of 15–18 year-old high school girls in [[Nadroga]], [[Fiji]] found the self-reported incidence of purging rose from 0% in 1995 (a few weeks after the introduction of television in the province) to 11.3% in 1998.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Becker AE, Burwell RA, Gilman SE, Herzog DB, Hamburg P |title=Eating behaviours and attitudes following prolonged exposure to television among ethnic Fijian adolescent girls |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=180 |issue= 6|pages=509–14 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12042229 |doi=10.1192/bjp.180.6.509}}</ref>

Through the cognitive and socio-cultural perspectives, indications towards the origin of bulimia nervosa can be established. Fairburn ''et al.''’s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa provides a chief indication of the cause of bulimia through a cognitive perspective, while the “[[The Thin Ideal|thin ideal]]” is particularly responsible for the etiology of bulimia nervosa through a socio-cultural context.
When attempting to decipher the origin of bulimia nervosa in a cognitive context, Fairburn ''et al.''’s cognitive behavioral model is often considered the golden standard. Fairburn ''et al.''’s model discusses the process in which an individual falls into the binge-purge cycle and thus develops bulimia. Fairburn ''et al.'' argue that extreme concern with weight and shape coupled with low self esteem will result in strict, rigid, and inflexible dietary rules. Accordingly, this would lead to unrealistic restricted eating, which may consequently induce an eventual “slip” where the individual commits a minor infraction of the strict and inflexible dietary rules. Moreover, the cognitive distortion due to dichotomous thinking leads the individual to binge. The binge subsequently should trigger a perceived loss of control, promoting the individual to purge in hope of counteracting the binge. However, Fairburn ''et al.'' assert the cycle repeats itself, and thus consider the binge-purge cycle to be self-perpetuating.

In contrast, Byrne and Mclean’s findings differed slightly from Fairburn ''et al.''’s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa in that the drive for thinness was the major cause of purging as a way of controlling weight. In turn, Byrne and Mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to binging, indicating that it is not a binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before binging. Similarly, Fairburn ''et al.''’s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist. Everyone differs from another, and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid. In addition, the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the Western society. To evaluate, Fairburn ''et al.''’s model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory, as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect, because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trull|first=Thimothy|title=Abnormal Psychology and Life: A Dimensional Approach|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont CA|isbn=978-1-111-34376-7|pages=236–8|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=0kEcIFJUk64C&pg=PA236}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Byrne SM, McLean NJ |title=The cognitive-behavioral model of bulimia nervosa: a direct evaluation |journal=Int J Eat Disord |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=17–31 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11835294 |doi=10.1002/eat.10002}}</ref>

When exploring the etiology of bulimia through a socio-cultural perspective, the “thin ideal internalization” is significantly responsible. The thin ideal internalization is the extent to which individuals adapt to the societal ideals of attractiveness. Individuals first accept and “buy into” the ideals, and then attempt to transform themselves in order to reflect the societal ideals of attractiveness. J. Kevin Thompson and Eric Stice claim that family, peers, and most evidently media reinforce the thin ideal, which may lead to an individual accepting and “buying into” the thin ideal. In turn, Thompson and Stice assert that if the thin ideal is accepted, one could begin to feel uncomfortable with their body shape or size since it may not necessarily reflect the thin ideal set out by society. Thus, people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in suffering from body dissatisfaction, and may develop a certain drive for thinness. Consequently, body dissatisfaction coupled with drive for thinness is thought to promote dieting and negative affects, which could eventually lead to bulimic symptoms such as purging or binging. Binges lead to self-disgust which causes purging to prevent weight gain.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zieve|first=David|title=Bulimia|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001381/|publisher=PubMed Health|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}</ref>

A study dedicated to investigating the thin ideal internalization as a factor of bulimia nervosa is Thompson’s and Stice’s research. The aim of their study was to investigate how and to what degree does media effect the thin ideal internalization. Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) dedicated to teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, in order to reduce thin ideal internalization. The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media’s control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal internalization. Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media affected greatly the thin ideal internalization.<ref name="Sage journals online">{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Kevin|coauthors=Stice Eric|title=Eating Pathology Thin-Ideal Internalization: Mounting Evidence for a New Risk Factor for Body-Image Disturbance and|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2001|month=October|volume=10|pages=181–183|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00144|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/search/results?fulltext=J.+Kevin+Thompson+and+Eric+Stice&x=0&y=0&submit=yes&journal_set=spcdp&src=selected&andorexactfulltext=and|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
There is little data on the prevalence of bulimia nervosa in general populations. Most studies conducted thus far have been on convenience samples from hospital patients, high school or university students. These have yielded a wide range of results: between 0.1% and 1.4% of males, and between 0.3% and 9.4% of females.<ref name="makino">{{Cite journal|author=Makino M, Tsuboi K, Dennerstein L |title=Prevalence of eating disorders: a comparison of Western and non-Western countries |journal=MedGenMed |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=49 |year=2004 |pmid=15520673 |pmc=1435625 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/487413}}</ref>  Studies on time trends in the prevalence of bulimia nervosa have also yielded inconsistent results.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hay PJ, Mond J, Buttner P, Darby A|editor1-last=Murthy|editor1-first=R.

==Treatment==
There are two main types of treatment given to those suffering with bulimia nervosa; psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoste RR, Labuschagne Z, Le Grange D |title=Adolescent bulimia nervosa |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=391–7 |year=2012 |month=August |pmid=22614677 |doi=10.1007/s11920-012-0280-0 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y8j60284614v1730/}}</ref>

===Psychotherapy===
There are several empirically supported psychosocial treatments for bulimia nervosa. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), which involves teaching clients to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioral experiments (for example, in session eating of "forbidden foods") has demonstrated efficacy both with and without concurrent antidepressant medication. Research suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective psychotherapeutic treatment for bulimia nervosa. One exception was a study that suggested that interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) might be as effective as CBT, although slower to achieve its effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Agras, MD|first=W. Stewart|coauthors=B. Timothy Walsh, MD; Christopher G. Fairburn, MD; G. Terence Wilson, PhD; Helena C. Kraemer, PhD|title=A Multicenter Comparison of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Bulimia Nervosa|journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry|year=2005|month=May|volume=57|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/cgi/content/abstract/57/5/459?ijkey=9ee871bcc16d4bdd3bd14f894fb8c0e190febd13&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha}}</ref> By using CBT patients record how much food they eat and periods of vomiting with the purpose of identifying and avoiding emotional fluctuations that bring on episodes of bulimia on a regular basis (Gelder, Mayou and Geddes 2005). Barker (2003) states that research has found 40–60% of patients using cognitive behaviour therapy to become symptom free. He states in order for the therapy to work, all parties must work together to discuss, record and develop coping strategies. Barker (2003) claims by making people aware of their actions they will think of alternatives.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Agras WS, Crow SJ, Halmi KA, Mitchell JE, Wilson GT, Kraemer HC |title=Outcome predictors for the cognitive behavior treatment of bulimia nervosa: data from a multisite study |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=8 |pages=1302–8 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10910795 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.8.1302}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wilson GT, Loeb KL, Walsh BT, ''et al.'' |title=Psychological versus pharmacological treatments of bulimia nervosa: predictors and processes of change |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=451–9 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10450615 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.67.4.451}}</ref> Patients undergoing CBT who exhibit early behavioral changes are most likely to achieve the best treatment outcomes in the long run.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Curry E, Kaye WH, Rockwell RE, Runfola C, Trunko ME |title=Management of bulimia nervosa |journal=Women's Health London |volume=3 |issue=2 |url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Management+of+bulimia+nervosa&rft.jtitle=Women%27s+health+%28London%2C+England%29&rft.au=Trunko%2C+Mary+Ellen&rft.au=Runfola%2C+Cristin&rft.au=Rockwell%2C+Roxanne+E&rft.au=Kaye%2C+Walter+H&rft.au=Curry%2C+Elise&rft.date=2007-03-31&rft.issn=1745-5057&rft.volume=3&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=255&rft.epage=265&rft_id=info:doi/10.2217%2F17455057.3.2.255&rft.externalDBID=WMHF&rft.externalDocID=19803857}}</ref> Researchers have also reported some positive outcomes for interpersonal psychotherapy and [[dialectical behavior therapy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fairburn CG, Agras WS, Walsh BT, Wilson GT, Stice E |title=Prediction of outcome in bulimia nervosa by early change in treatment |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=12 |pages=2322–4 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15569910 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2322}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Safer DL, Telch CF, Agras WS |title=Dialectical behavior therapy for bulimia nervosa |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=4 |pages=632–4 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11282700 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.4.632}}</ref>

[[Maudsley Family Therapy]] a.k.a. Family Based Treatment (FBT), developed at the Maudsley Hospital in [[London]] for the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) has been shown to have positive results for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. FBT has been shown through [[empirical]] research to be the most efficacious treatment of AN for patients under the age of eighteen and within three years of onset of illness. The studies to date using FBT to treat BN have been promising.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lock J, le Grange D |title=Family-based treatment of eating disorders |journal=Int J Eat Disord |volume=37 |issue=Suppl |pages=S64–7; discussion S87–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15852323 |doi=10.1002/eat.20122 }}</ref>

The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be quite effective for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |author=Keel PK, Haedt A |title=Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for eating problems and eating disorders |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=39–61 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18444053 |doi=10.1080/15374410701817832 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15374410701817832}}</ref> Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Le Grange|first=Daniel|title=Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents with Bulimia Nervosa|journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy|year=2010|volume=31|issue=2|pages=165–175|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change,<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Castro-Fornieles, Bigorra, Martinez-Mallen, Gonzalez, Moreno, Font, & Toro|title=Motivation to change in adolescents with bulimia nervosa mediates clinical change after treatment|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|date=27|year=2011|month=September|volume=19|pages=46–54|doi=10.1002/erv.1045|url=http://www.wileyonlinelibrary.com|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent's food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Adolescents with BN whom are either resistant to change or have not been successful with treatments such as CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or IPT (Interpersonal Psychotherapy) could get recommended to try Cue Exposure (CE) by therapists.<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Martinez-Mallen, Castro-Fornieles, Lazaro, Moreno, Morer, Font Julien, Vila & Toro|title=Cue Exposure in the Treatment of Resistant Adolescent Bulimia Nervosa|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=2|year=2007|month=July|volume=40|issue=7|pages=596–601|doi=10.1002/eat.20423|url=http://www.interscience.wiley.com|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref> In this type of therapy, a patient is presented in the beginning of each session with a "forbidden food", allowing the individual to pick up the item to feel and smell it, but they are not allowed to eat it. This will usually provoke a lot of stress and anxiety in the adolescent with BN, which ultimately leads them to have a feeling of intense hunger and wish to partake in binge eating. To help control their eating behaviors, the therapist attempts with CE to expose the adolescent to the food and condition them in order to not feel as much anxiety when presented with the food. If they do not feel as much stress or anxiety when the food is right in front of them, then they will be less likely to feel the need to binge and then purge.

Some researchers have also claimed positive outcomes in [[hypnotherapy]] treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Barabasz M |title=Treatment of bulimia with hypnosis involving awareness and control in clients with high dissociative capacity |journal=International Journal of Psychosomatics |volume=37 |issue=1–4 |pages=53–6 |year=1990 |pmid=2246105}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Barabasz M |title=Efficacy of hypnotherapy in the treatment of eating disorders |journal=The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=318–35 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17558721 |doi=10.1080/00207140701338688}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Griffiths RA |year=1995 |title=Two-Year Follow-Up Findings of Hypnobehavioural Treatment for Bulimia Nervosa |journal=Australian Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=135–44}}</ref>

===Pharmacological treatment===
Some researchers have hypothesized a relationship to mood disorders and clinical trials have been conducted with tricyclic antidepressants,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mitchell JE, Raymond N, Specker S |title=A review of the controlled trials of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the treatment of bulimia nervosa |journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=229–47 |year=1993 |month=November |pmid=8275060 |doi=10.1002/1098-108X(199311)14:3<229::AID-EAT2260140302>3.0.CO;2-X}}</ref> [[MAO inhibitors]], [[mianserin]], [[fluoxetine]],<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Walsh |first1=B T |year=1995 |chapter=Pharmacotherapy of eating disorders |editor1-first=K D |editor2-first=C G |title=Eating Disorders and Obesity: A Comprehensive Handbook |location=New York |publisher=Guilford |pages=329–40 |isbn=978-0-89862-850-0 |editor-last=Brownell |editor3-last=Fairburn}}</ref> lithium carbonate, nomifensine, trazodone, and bupropion.

Research groups who have seen a relationship to seizure disorders have attempted treatment with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid.  Opiate antagonists naloxone and naltrexone, which block cravings for gambling, have also been used.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mitchell JE, Christenson G, Jennings J, ''et al.'' |title=A placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study of naltrexone hydrochloride in outpatients with normal weight bulimia |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=94–7 |year=1989 |month=April |pmid=2656781 |doi=10.1097/00004714-198904000-00004}}</ref>

There has also been some research characterizing bulimia nervosa as an addiction disorder, and limited clinical use of [[topiramate]], which blocks cravings for opiates, cocaine, alcohol and food.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slaby |first=Andrew Edmund |title=The eating disorders |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-387-94002-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

It is not known if combining pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy will improve the outcome of the treatments. Any trials which originally suggested that such combinations should improve the outcome, have not proven to be exceptionally powerful. Some positive outcomes of treatments can include: abstinence from binge eating, a decrease in obsessive behaviours to lose weight and in shape preoccupation, less severe psychiatric symptoms, a desire to counter the effects of binge eating, as well as an improvement in social functioning and relapse rates.<ref>P.J.Hay and A.Claudino, [http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Bulimia+nervosa&rft.jtitle=Clinical+evidence&rft.au=Hay%2C+Phillipa+J&rft.au=Claudino%2C+Ang%C3%A9lica+Medeiros&rft.date=2010&rft.eissn=1752-8526&rft.volume=2010&rft_id=info:pmid/21418667&rft.externalDocID=21418667"Clinical Evidence Bulimia Nervosa"]</ref>
