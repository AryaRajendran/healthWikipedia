'''Personal genomics''' is the branch of [[genomics]] concerned with the [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] and [[bioinformatics|analysis]] of the genome of an individual. The genotyping stage employs different techniques, including [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) analysis chips (typically 0.02% of the genome), or partial or [[full genome sequencing]]. Once the genotypes are known, the individual's genotype can be compared with the published literature to determine likelihood of trait expression and disease risk.

Automated sequencers have increased the speed and reduced the cost of sequencing, making it possible to offer genetic testing to consumers.

== Use of personal genomics in predictive and precision medicine ==
[[Predictive medicine]] is the use of the information produced by personal genomics techniques when deciding what medical treatments are appropriate for a particular individual. Precision medicine is focused on "a new taxonomy of human disease based on molecular biology" <ref>{{cite book | title=Toward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease | publisher=The National Academies Press | date=2011}}</ref>

Examples of the use of predictive and precision medicine include [[medical genetics | inherited medical genomics]], [[cancer genomics]] and [[pharmacogenomics]].  In pharmacogenomics genetic information can be used to select the most appropriate drug to prescribe to a patient. The drug should be chosen to maximize the probability of obtaining the desired result in the patient and minimize the probability that the patient will experience side effects. Genetic information may allow physicians to tailor therapy to a given patient, in order to increase drug efficacy and minimize side effects. As of Oct 2012 there are 167 examples of drug gene pairs for which this information is currently useful in clinical practice and this number has been growing rapidly.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pharmgkb.org/|title=The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase}}</ref>

Disease risk may be calculated based on genetic markers and [[genome-wide association studies]] for common medical conditions, which are [[multifactorial inheritance|multifactorial]] and include environmental components in the assessment. Diseases which are individually rare (less than one in 200,000 people affected) are nevertheless collectively common (affecting roughly 8-10% of the US population<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/AboutUs.aspx |title=NIH Office of Rare Disease Research}}</ref>).  Over 2500 of these diseases (including a few more common ones) have predictive genetics of sufficiently high clinical impact that they are recommended as medical genetic tests available for single genes (and in whole genome sequencing) and growing at about 200 new genetic diseases per year.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/GeneTests/static/whatsnew/labdirgrowth.shtml | title=Gene Tests}}</ref>

== Cost of sequencing an individual's genome ==
[[File:DNA Sequencing Cost per Genome Over Time.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=Trend in sequencing costs|Typical cost of sequencing a human-sized genome, on a logarithmic scale.

The cost of sequencing a human genome is dropping rapidly, due to the continual development of new, faster, cheaper DNA sequencing technologies such as [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|"next generation DNA sequencing"]].

The National Human Genome Research Institute, part of the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]], has set a target to be able to sequence a human-sized genome for US$100,000 by 2009 and US$1,000 by 2014.<ref name="nhgri" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/03/0307_060307_dna.html |title=Coming Soon: Your Personal DNA Map? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>

There are 6 billion base pairs in the diploid human genome. Statistical analysis reveals that a coverage of approximately ten times is required to get coverage of both alleles in 90% human genome from 25 base-pair reads with shotgun sequencing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v452/n7189/extref/nature06884-s1.pdf |title=JDW-genome-supp-mat-march-proof.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> This means a total of 60&nbsp;billion base pairs that must be sequenced.

The purchase cost, personnel costs and data processing costs must also be taken into account. Sequencing a human genome cost approximately $300,000 in 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Comparative genomics ==
[[Comparative genomics]] analysis characterizes the differences and similarities between whole genomes. It may be applied to both genomes from individuals from different species or individuals from the same species, generally at lower cost than sequencing from scratch.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Ethical issues ==
[[Genetic discrimination]] is discriminating on the basis of information obtained from an individual’s genome. Genetic non-discrimination laws have been enacted in some US states and,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} at the federal level, by the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA). The GINA legislation prevents discrimination by health insurers and employers, but does not apply to life insurance or long-term care insurance.

Patients will need to be educated on interpreting their results and what they should be rationally taking from the experience. It is not only the average person who needs to be educated in the dimensions of their own genomic sequence but also professionals, including physicians and science journalists, who must be provided with the knowledge required to inform and educate their patients and the public <ref>{{cite web|author=Lunshof, Jeantine, Mardis, Elaine |url=Retrieved from http://www.future-science-group.com/_img/pics/Mardis_-_Foreward.pdf |title=Navigenics – How it works |publisher= Future Medicine Magazine |accessdate= 30 March 2012}}</ref>

==Other issues==

Full sequencing of the genome can identify [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] that are so rare that no conclusions may be drawn about their impact, creating uncertainty in the analysis of individual genomes, particularly in the context of clinical care. Czech medical geneticist Eva Machácková writes: "In some cases it is difficult to distinguish if the detected sequence variant is a causal mutation or a neutral (polymorphic) variation without any effect on phenotype. The interpretation of rare sequence variants of unknown significance detected in disease-causing genes becomes an increasingly important problem."<ref>{{Cite journal | journal=Cas Lek Cesk | title=Disease-causing mutations versus neutral polymorphism: Use of bioinformatics and DNA diagnosis | publisher=Ceskoslovenska Lekarska Spolecnost | place= Czech Republic | author=Machácková, Eva | volume=142 | issue=3 | pages=150–153 | pmid = 12756842 | year = 2003 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

There is a heavy debate as to how relevant the results of personal genome kits are and whether or not the ramifications of knowing one’s predisposition to a disease is worth the potential psychological stress. There are also three potential problems associated with the validity of personal genome kits. The first issue is the test’s validity. Handling errors of the sample increases the likelihood for errors which could affect the test results and interpretation. The second affects the clinical validity, which could affect the test’s ability to detect or predict associated disorders. The third problem is the clinical utility of personal genome kits and associated risks, and the benefits of introducing them into clinical practices. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hunter DJ, Khoury MJ, Drazen JM |title=Letting the genome out of the bottle—will we get our wish? |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=358 |issue=2 |pages=105–7 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18184955 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp0708162 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMp0708162?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref>

Doctors are currently conducting tests for which some are not correctly trained to interpret the results. Many are unaware of how SNPs respond to one another. This results in presenting the client with potentially misleading and worrisome results which could strain the already overloaded health care system.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lea DH, Skirton H, Read CY, Williams JK |title=Implications for educating the next generation of nurses on genetics and genomics in the 21st century |journal=J Nurs Scholarsh |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=3–12 |year=2011 |month=March |pmid=21342419 |doi=10.1111/j.1547-5069.2010.01373.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1527-6546&date=2011&volume=43&issue=1&spage=3}}</ref> This may antagonize the individual to make uneducated decisions such as unhealthy lifestyle choices and family planning modifications. Moreover, negative results which may potentially be inaccurate, theoretically decrease the quality of life and mental health of the individual (such as increased depression and extensive anxiety). 

There is also controversy regarding the concerns with companies testing individual DNA. There are issues such as "leaking" information, the right to privacy and what responsibility the company has to ensure this does not happen. Regulation rules are not clearly laid out. What is still not determined is who legally owns the genome information: the company or the individual whose genome has been read. There have been published examples of personal genome information being exploited.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gurwitz D, Bregman-Eschet Y |title=Personal genomics services: whose genomes? |journal=Eur. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=883–9 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19259127 |pmc=2986500 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2008.254 }}</ref> Additional privacy concerns, related to, e.g., [[genetic discrimination]], loss of anonymity, and psychological impacts, have been increasingly pointed out by the academic community <ref>{{cite journal |author=De Cristofaro, E.|title=Whole Genome Sequencing: Innovation Dream or Privacy Nightmare? |journal=ArXiv Repository |year=2012 |url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4820}}</ref> as well as government agencies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|title=Privacy and Progress in Whole Genome Sequencing |year=2012 |url=http://www.bioethics.gov/cms/sites/default/files/PrivacyProgress508.pdf}}</ref>

Conversely, sequencing one’s genome would allow for more personalized medical treatments using pharmacogenomics; the use of genetic information to select appropriate drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blow N |title=Genomics: the personal side of genomics |journal=Nature |volume=449 |issue=7162 |pages=627–30 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17914399 |doi=10.1038/449627a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7162/full/449627a.html}}</ref> Treatments can be catered to the individual and the certain genetic predispositions they may have (such as personalized chemotherapy).
