'''Septoplasty''' is a corrective [[surgery|surgical]] procedure done to straighten the [[nasal septum]], the partition  between the two [[Nasal cavity|nasal cavities]]. Ideally, the septum should run down the center of the [[Human nose|nose]]. When it [[deviated septum|deviates]] into one of the cavities, it narrows that cavity and impedes airflow.  Often the inferior [[turbinate]] on the opposite side enlarges, which is termed ''[[Compensatory growth (organ)|compensatory hypertrophy]]''. Deviations of the septum can lead to nasal obstruction. Most surgeries are completed in 60 minutes or less, not including recovery time.

== Procedure ==
The procedure usually involves a judicious excision/realignment of a portion of the bone and/or cartilage in the nasal cavity. Under [[general anesthesia|general]] or [[local anesthesia]], the surgeon works through the nostrils, making an incision in the lining of the septum to reach the cartilage targeted in the operation.  Sufficient cartilage is preserved for structural support. After the septum is straightened, it may then be stabilized temporarily with small plastic tubes, splints, or sutures internally.

==Post-operation==
Unless there are unusual complications, there is no swelling or discoloration to the external nose or face with septoplasty alone.  Packing is rare with modern surgical techniques, but splinting the inside of the nose for a few days is common (these are not visible externally). One percent of patients can experience excessive bleeding afterwards&nbsp;â€” the risk period lasts up to two weeks. This could require packing or cautery, but is generally handled safely and without compromise of the ultimate surgical result.
