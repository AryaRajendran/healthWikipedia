'''Human granulocytic anaplasmosis''' (HGA) (previously known as '''Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis''', or '''HGE'''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malik A, Jameel M, Ali S, Mir S |title=Human granulocytic anaplasmosis affecting the myocardium |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=20 |issue=10 |pages=958 |year=2005 |pmid=16191146 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.00218.x |pmc=1490240}}</ref><ref>[http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/anaplasmosis/basics.html Human Anaplasmosis Basics - Minnesota Dept. of Health<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ) is an [[infectious disease]] caused by ''[[Anaplasma phagocytophilum]]'', an obligate intracellular [[bacterium]] that is typically transmitted to humans by at least three kinds of [[tick]]s, including ''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'', ''[[Ixodes pacificus]]'', and  ''[[Dermacentor variabilis]]''. These ticks also transmit [[Lyme disease]] and other diseases.<ref>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/0022-2585%282003%29040%5B0534%3ADOBBEC%5D2.0.CO%3B2</ref> 

The bacteria infect white blood cells called [[neutrophils]], causing changes in gene expression that prolong the life of these otherwise short-lived cells.<ref>PMID: {{cite journal |author=Lee HC, Kioi M, Han J, Puri RK, Goodman JL |title=Anaplasma phagocytophilum-induced gene expression in both human neutrophils and HL-60 cells |journal=Genomics |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=144–51 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18603403 |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2008.05.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0888-7543(08)00100-6}}</ref>

==Ecology and epidemiology==
A. phagocytophilum is transmitted to humans by the ''Ixodes persulcatus'' group of ticks.  These ticks are found in the US, Europe, and Asia.  In the US, ''I. scapularis'' is the tick vector in the East and Midwest states, and ''I. pacificus'' in the Pacific Northwest.<ref name="pmid17582569">{{cite journal |author=Dumler JS, Madigan JE, Pusterla N, Bakken JS |title=Ehrlichioses in humans: epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=45 |issue= Suppl 1 |pages=S45–51 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17582569 |doi=10.1086/518146 |url=}}</ref> 

The major mammalian reservoir for ''A. phagocytophilum'' in the eastern United States is the white-footed mouse, ''Peromyscus leucopus''.  Although white-tailed deer harbor ''A. phagocytophilum'', evidence suggests that they are not a reservoir for the strains that cause HGA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Massung RF, Courtney JW, Hiratzka SL, Pitzer VE, Smith G, Dryden RL |title=Anaplasma phagocytophilum in white-tailed deer |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=1604–6 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16318705 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

''[[Anaplasma phagocytophilum]]'' shares its tick vector with other human pathogens, and about 10% of patients with HGA show serologic evidence of coinfection with [[Lyme disease]], [[babesiosis]], or [[tick-borne meningoencephalitis]].<ref name="pmid16485466">{{cite journal |author=Dumler JS, Choi KS, Garcia-Garcia JC, ''et al.'' |title=Human granulocytic anaplasmosis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=1828–34 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16485466 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms may include [[fever]], severe [[headache]], muscle aches ([[myalgia]]), chills and shaking, similar to the symptoms of [[influenza]].  Symptoms may be minor, as evidenced by surveillance studies in high-risk areas.  [[Gastrointestinal tract|GI]] symptoms occur in less than half of patients and a skin rash is seen in less than 10% of patients. It is also characterized by [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leukopenia]], and elevated [[Blood plasma|serum]] [[transaminase]] levels in the majority of infected patients.<ref>Murray, Patrick R.; Rosenthal, Ken S.; Pfaller, Michael A. ''Medical Microbiology, Fifth Edition''. United States: Elsevier Mosby, 2005</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Clinically, HGA is essentially indistinguishable from [[Human monocytic ehrlichiosis]], the infection caused by ''[[Ehrlichia chaffeensis]]'', and other tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease may be suspected.  As Ehrlichia serologies can be negative in the acute period, [[PCR]] is  very useful for diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prince LK, Shah AA, Martinez LJ, Moran KA |title=Ehrlichiosis: making the diagnosis in the acute setting |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=100 |issue=8 |pages=825–8 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17713310 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0038-4348&volume=100&issue=8&spage=825}}</ref>

==Treatment and Prevention==
[[Doxycycline]] is the treatment of choice. If anaplasmosis is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive laboratory confirmation, as prompt doxycycline therapy has been shown to improve outcomes.<ref name="PMD18344803">{{cite journal |author=Hamburg BJ, Storch GA, Micek ST, Kollef MH |title=The importance of early treatment with doxycycline in human ehrlichiosis |journal=Medicine |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=53–60 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18344803 |doi=10.1097/MD.0b013e318168da1d |url=}}</ref> Presentation during early pregnancy can complicate treatment.

==Terminology==
Although the infectious agent is known to be from the [[Anaplasma]] genus, the term "human granulocytic ehrlichiosis" (HGE) is often used, reflecting the prior classification of the organism.  ''E. phagocytophilum'' and ''E. equi'' were reclassified as ''Anaplasma phagocytophilum''.
