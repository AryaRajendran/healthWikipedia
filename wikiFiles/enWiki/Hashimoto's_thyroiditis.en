'''Hashimoto's thyroiditis''' or '''chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis''' is an [[autoimmune disease]] in which the [[thyroid]] gland is attacked by a variety of cell- and antibody-mediated immune processes. It was the first disease to be recognized as an autoimmune disease.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nakazawa |first=Donna |title=The Autoimmune Epidemic |year=2008 |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |pages=32–35 |isbn=978-0-7432-7775-4 }}</ref> It was first described by the Japanese specialist [[Hakaru Hashimoto]] in Germany in 1912.

==Signs and symptoms==
Hashimoto's thyroiditis very often results in [[hypothyroidism]] with bouts of [[hyperthyroidism]].
Symptoms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis include [[Myxedematous psychosis]], weight gain, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[mania]], sensitivity to heat and cold, [[paresthesia]], fatigue, panic attacks, [[bradycardia]], [[tachycardia]], high cholesterol, [[reactive hypoglycemia]], constipation, migraines, muscle weakness, joint stiffness, [[menorrhagia]], cramps, memory loss, vision problems, infertility and hair loss.

The thyroid gland may become firm, large, and [[lobulated]] in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but changes in the thyroid can also be nonpalpable.<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=yvZ9965dqxAC&pg=PA56 Page 56] in: {{cite book |author=Staecker, Hinrich; Thomas R. Van De Water; Van de Water, Thomas R. |title=Otolaryngology: basic science and clinical review |publisher=Thieme |location=Stuttgart |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-86577-901-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Enlargement of the thyroid is due to [[Lymphocyte|lymphocytic infiltration]] and [[fibrosis]] rather than tissue [[hypertrophy]].
Physiologically, [[antibody|antibodies]] against [[thyroid peroxidase]] (TPO) and/or [[thyroglobulin]] cause gradual destruction of [[thyroid follicle|follicles]] in the [[thyroid]] gland. Accordingly, the disease can be detected clinically by looking for these antibodies in the blood. It is also characterized by invasion of the thyroid tissue by [[leukocytes]], mainly [[T-cell|T-lymphocytes]]. It is associated with [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by detecting elevated levels of [[anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies]] in the serum.

Given the relatively [[non-specific symptom]]s of initial hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is often misdiagnosed as [[Major Depressive Disorder|depression]], [[cyclothymia]], [[premenstrual syndrome|PMS]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[fibromyalgia]] and, less frequently, as [[erectile dysfunction|ED]]  or  an [[anxiety disorder]]. On gross examination, there is often presentation of a hard [[goitre]] that is not painful to the touch;<ref name="Kumar2010">{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Mechanisms of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philidelphia, PA|edition=8th|page=1113|chapter=24: The Endocrine System}}</ref> other symptoms seen with hypothyroidism, such as periorbital [[myxedema]], depends on the current state of progression of the response, especially given the usually gradual development of clinically relevant hypothyroidism. Testing for [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), Free T3, Free T4, and the anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) and anti-microsomal antibodies can help obtain an accurate diagnosis.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Giannini |first1= AJ |authorlink1= |title= The Biological Foundations of Clinical Psychiatry |url=  |year= 1986 |publisher= Medical Examination Publishing Company |location= New Hyde Park, NY |language= |isbn= 0-87488-449-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 193–198 |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}</ref> Earlier assessment of the patient may present with elevated levels of thyroglobulin owing to the transient [[thyrotoxicosis]] as inflammation within the thyroid causes damage to the integrity of thyroid follicle storage of thyroglobulin; TSH is concomitantly decreased.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simmons|first=PJ|coauthors=Dellemarre, FG., Drexhage, HA.|title=Antigen-presenting dendritic cells as regulators of the growth of thyrocytes: a role of interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6|journal=Endocrinology|year=1998|month=July|volume=139|issue=7|pages=3158–3186|pmid=9645688|doi=10.1210/en.139.7.3148}}</ref> [[File:Hashimoto-Thyreoiditis.JPG|thumb|Ultrasound imaging of the thyroid gland (right lobe longitudinal) in patient with Hashimoto Thyroiditis.]]
This exposure of the body to substantial amounts of previously isolated thyroid enzymes is thought to contribute to the exacerbation of tolerance breakdown, giving rise to the more pronounced symptoms seen later in the disease. Lymphocytic infiltration of the [[thyrocyte]]-associated tissues often leads to the histologically significant finding of [[germinal center]] development within the thyroid gland.

Hashimoto's when presenting as mania is known as Prasad's syndrome after Ashok Prasad, the psychiatrist who first described it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prasad's syndrome|format=PDF|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/152/3/438b?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=weiner+kennedy&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
A family history of thyroid disorders is common, with the ''[[HLA-DR antigens|HLA-DR5]]'' gene most strongly implicated conferring a [[relative risk]] of 3 in the UK. In addition Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be associated with ''[[CTLA-4]]'' (''Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Associated-4'') gene polymorphisms that result in reduced functioning of the gene's products, which are associated with negative regulation of T-lymphocyte activity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.2007-0147 |title=Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Antigen 4 Gene Polymorphisms and Autoimmune Thyroid Disease: A Meta-Analysis |year=2007 |last1=Kavvoura |first1=F.

Neither result was seen to a similar degree in dizygotic twins, offering strong favour for high genetic aetiology.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1740-2557-2-1 |year=2005 |last1=Chistiakov |first1=Dimitry A |journal=Journal of Autoimmune Diseases |volume=2 |pages=1 |pmid=15762980 |title=Immunogenetics of Hashimoto's thyroiditis |issue=1 |pmc=555850}}</ref>

Preventable environmental factors, including high iodine intake, [[selenium deficiency]], and pollutants such as tobacco smoke, as well as infectious diseases and certain drugs, have been implicated in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in genetically predisposed individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000324442 |title=Why is the Thyroid So Prone to Autoimmune Disease |year=2011 |last1=Saranac |first1=L. |last2=Zivanovic |first2=S. |last3=Bjelakovic |first3=B. |last4=Stamenkovic |first4=H. |last5=Novak |first5=M. |last6=Kamenov |first6=B. |journal=Hormone Research in Paediatrics |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=157–65 |pmid=21346360}}</ref> The genes implicated vary in different ethnic groups and the incidence is increased in patients with chromosomal disorders, including [[Turner syndrome|Turner]], [[Down syndrome|Down's]], and [[Klinefelter syndrome]]s usually associated with autoantibodies against thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase. Progressive depletion of these cells as the cytotoxic immune response develops leads to higher degrees of primary hypothyroidism, presenting with a poverty of T3/T4 levels, and compensatory elevations of TSH.

Recent research suggests a potential role for [[HHV-6]] (possibly variant A) in the development or triggering of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Virologic and immunologic evidence supporting an association between HHV-6 and Hashimoto's thyroiditis|year=2012|month=Oct|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002951|editor1-last=Moore|editor1-first=Patrick S|last1=Caselli|first1=Elisabetta|last2=Zatelli|first2=Maria Chiara|last3=Rizzo|first3=Roberta|last4=Benedetti|first4=Sabrina|last5=Martorelli|first5=Debora|last6=Trasforini|first6=Giorgio|last7=Cassai|first7=Enzo|last8=Degli Uberti|first8=Ettore C.|last9=Di Luca|first9=Dario|journal=PLoS Pathogens|volume=8|issue=10|pages=e1002951|pmid=23055929|pmc=3464215}}</ref>

==Mechanisms and pathology==
There are multiple suggested mechanisms by which the pathology of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis develops.
Various autoantibodies may be present against [[thyroid peroxidase]], [[thyroglobulin]] and [[TSH receptors]], although a small percentage of patients may have none of these antibodies present. As indicated in various twin studies a percentage of the population may also have these antibodies without developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nevertheless, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ([[CD8]]+ T-cells) in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-lymphocytes ([[CD4]]+ T-cells) is central to thyrocyte destruction. As is characteristic of [[Type IV hypersensitivity|type IV hypersensitivities]], recruitment of [[macrophages]] is another effect of the helper T-lymphocyte activation, with [[Th1 cell|Th1]] axis lymphocytes producing inflammatory [[cytokines]] within thyroid tissue to further macrophage activation and migration into the thyroid gland for direct effect.

Gross morphological changes within the thyroid are seen in the general enlargement which is far more locally nodular and irregular than more diffuse patterns (such as that of [[hyperthyroidism]]). While the capsule is intact and the gland itself is still distinct from surrounding tissue, microscopic examination can provide a more revealing indication of the level of damage.<ref name="Kumar2010" />

Histologically, the hypersensitivity is seen as diffuse parenchymal infiltration by lymphocytes, particularly [[Plasma cell|plasma B-cells]], which can often be seen as secondary lymphoid follicles (germinal centers, not to be confused with the normally present colloid-filled [[Thyroid follicle|follicles]] that constitute the thyroid). Atrophy of the colloid bodies is lined by [[Hurthle cell|Hürthle cells]], cells with intensely [[Eosinophilia|eosinophilic]], granular cytoplasm, a [[metaplasia]] from the normal cuboidal cells that constitute the lining of the thyroid follicles. Severe thyroid atrophy presents often with denser fibrotic bands of [[collagen]] that remains within the confines of the thyroid capsule.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Mechanisms of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philidelphia, PA|edition=8th|pages=1112–1113|chapter=24: The Endocrine System}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Hypothyroidism]] caused by Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is treated with thyroid hormone replacement agents such as [[levothyroxine]], [[triiodothyronine]] or [[desiccated thyroid extract]]. A tablet taken once a day generally keeps the thyroid hormone levels normal. In most cases, the treatment needs to be taken for the rest of the patient's life. In the event that hypothyroidism is caused by Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, it is recommended that the TSH levels be kept under 3.0.<ref>{{cite web|title=Does Your Doctor Know About the New TSH Lab Standards?|url=http://thyroid.about.com/cs/testsforthyroid/a/labs2003.htm}}</ref> As long as the patient's thyroid is active, the body will continue to attack it, and this can wreak havoc on the patient's TSH levels and symptoms.

Preliminary studies have suggested a correlation between Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and [[Celiac sprue]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Connection Found Between Celiac Disease and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis|url=http://www.celiac.com/articles/1135/1/Connection-Found-between-Celiac-Disease-and-Hashimotos-Thyroiditis/Page1.html}}</ref>  While it has not been rigorously explored, there is anecdotal evidence that a gluten-free diet may reduce the autoimmune response responsible for thyroid degeneration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wendy vs. Autoimmune Hypothyroid|url=http://wendyvshypothyroid.blogspot.com/}}{{MEDRS|date=June 2012}}</ref>  A study published in January 2012 compared a group of confirmed celiac patients to a control group of healthy individuals, starting a gluten-free diet and continuing for one year.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00365521.2011.639084 |title=Gluten-free diet and autoimmune thyroiditis in patients with celiac disease. A prospective controlled study |year=2012 |last1=Metso |first1=Saara |last2=Hyytiä-Ilmonen |first2=Henni |last3=Kaukinen |first3=Katri |last4=Huhtala |first4=Heini |last5=Jaatinen |first5=Pia |last6=Salmi |first6=Jorma |last7=Taurio |first7=Jyrki |last8=Collin |first8=Pekka |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=47 |pages=43–8 |pmid=22126672 |issue=1}}</ref>  While there was a higher occurrence of thyroiditis found amongst the Celiac group, there was no reduction in their level of anti-TPO antibody, improvement in thyroid function, or change in thyroid volume reduction after one year without gluten.  The study mentions that its results disagree with other studies.

==Prognosis==
If untreated for an extended period, Hashimoto's thyroiditis may lead to muscle failure, including possible heart failure. An extremely rare condition associated with the thyroiditis is [[Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]. Although it is well-accepted that Hashimoto's thyroiditis does not cause Hashimoto's encephalopathy, those with Hashimoto's encephalopathy are virtually always eventually diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.<ref>http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=790539</ref><ref>http://henotebook.wordpress.com/case-studies/</ref>

A rare association is with lymphoma of the thyroid gland.  Hashitoxicosis resulting from Hashimoto's has also been reported in a case of acquired von Willebrand's Syndrome and Pernicious Anemia.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20485667_Acquired_von_Willebrand_syndrome_associated_with_Hashitoxicosis_and_pernicious_anemia_combined.</ref>

Hashimoto's thyroiditis can disrupt growth in children and adolescents and therefore requires close growth monitoring. Growth hormone therapy may be required if the patient's stature is extreme enough.

==Epidemiology==
This disorder is believed to be the most common cause of primary [[hypothyroidism]] in [[North America]]; as a cause of non-endemic goiter, it is among the most common.<ref name="Kumar2010a">{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Mechanisms of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philidelphia, PA|edition=8th|pages=1111–205|chapter=24: The Endocrine System}}</ref> An average of 1 to 1.5 in a 1000 people have this disease.<ref name="Kumar2010a" /> It occurs far more often in women than in men (between 10:1 and 20:1), and is most prevalent between 45 and 65 years of age.<ref name="Kumar2010a" /> Occurrence in children is also not uncommon, especially in populations wherein iodine is a dietary scarcity, Hashimoto's is a major cause of goiter.<ref name="Kumar2010a" />

In European countries, an [[atrophic]] form of [[autoimmune]] thyroiditis ([[Ord's thyroiditis]]) is more common than Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

==History==
[[File:橋本通り.jpg|thumb|The explanation board of ''Hashimoto Dōri'' in [[Kyushu University]]]]
Also known as '''Hashimoto's disease''', Hashimoto's thyroiditis is named after the Japanese physician [[Hakaru Hashimoto]] (1881−1934) of the medical school at [[Kyushu University]],<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|1974|Hakaru Hashimoto}}</ref> who first described the symptoms of patients with ''struma lymphomatosa'', an intense infiltration of lymphocytes within the thyroid, in 1912 in a German publication.<ref>{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Hashimoto |title={{lang|de|Zur Kenntnis der lymphomatösen Veränderung der Schilddrüse (Struma lymphomatosa)}} |journal=Archiv für klinische Chirurgie |location=Berlin |year=1912 |volume=97 |pages=219–248 }}</ref> The report gave new insight into a condition (hypothyroidism) more commonly seen in areas of iodine deficiency that was occurring in the developed world, and without evident causation by dietary deficiency.
