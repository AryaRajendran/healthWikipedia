'''London's Air Ambulance''', also known as '''London HEMS''' (Helicopter Emergency Medical Service), is an [[air ambulance]] service that responds to injured casualties in and around [[London]], [[England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/ourservices/helicopter_medical_emergency_service_hems.asp |title=Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) - Barts and the London NHS Trust |publisher=Bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>

The service was formed in 1989 by Dr. Alastair Wilson OBE, as a response to a report by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] that criticised pre-hospital trauma care. It is now headed by [[Gareth Davies (doctor)|Dr. Gareth Davies]] (also Chairman of the charity's trustees) and is based at the [[Royal London Hospital]] in [[Whitechapel]]. The service was the first air ambulance in the [[United Kingdom]] to carry a [[Physician|doctor]]  trained in [[emergency medicine]] in addition to a [[paramedic]] at all times.<ref name=about>[http://www.londonsairambulance.co.uk/about-us About us], London's Air Ambulance. Retrieved 2 February 2012.</ref> Since the service was founded, trauma deaths in London and on the [[M25 motorway]] have fallen by more than 50%.<ref>http://www.londonsairambulance.com/SecureStore/welcome.aspx?Q1788=30&J847=x30&A988=&NL477=&F=&G=&C=&SC=&S9=0&UT1=&R=1&S=&RE=www.london.gov.uk&D=32 {{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

==Operational area==
The operational area of responsibility is London and the area within the M25, though it can fly further afield if requested to. The team can be airborne within two minutes of receiving a call. From its hospital base, the furthest section of the M25 and thus the usual limit of responsibility, is only 12 minutes flying time. The helicopter operates during daylight hours only because of the difficulties associated with landing on un-surveyed sites at night; during the dark hours it is replaced by rapid response cars.

==Helicopter==
[[Image:Old London HEMS.jpg|thumb|right|The former London Air Ambulance, an [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin|SA 365N Dauphin]] pictured in 1998, which was replaced in 2000]]
The current helicopter used is a [[MD Helicopters MD Explorer|McDonnell Douglas MD 902 Explorer]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] ''G-EHMS'', which is notable as it does not use a tail-rotor. This was a useful feature, as the helicopter must routinely land in confined inner city areas. It replaced a [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin|SA 365N Dauphin]], registered ''G-HEMS'', in October 2000.

Although the MD 902 Explorer is a quieter model aircraft than its predecessor, a number of noise complaints are still filed relating to HEMS.<ref>[http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/environment/helicopter_noise_evidence.pdf ]</ref>

The helicopter usually cruises at 130 knots, at an altitude of 1,500&nbsp;ft. A regular fuel load, around 400&nbsp;kg, allows for one hour's flying time.<ref>http://www.londonsairambulance.com/SecureStore/welcome.aspx?Q1788=30&J847=x30&A988=&NL477=&F=&G=&C=&SC=&S9=0&UT1=&R=1&S=&RE=www.londonsairambulance.com&D=32 {{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

From 6 March 2012, the helicopter became the UK's first air ambulance to carry emergency blood supplies, allowing transfusions to be administered at the scene of an accident rather than later in hospital. A specialised refrigerator installed in the helicopter allows the transport of four units of the universal O-negative [[blood type]] which can be stored in the aircraft for up to 72 hours (unused stocks can be returned to the hospital).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16928621 |title=Air ambulance first in UK to carry blood |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012 |author=Neil Bowdler |publisher=BBC }} </ref>

==Rapid response cars==
[[Image:London air ambulance response car.jpg|thumb|right|One of five rapid response cars, this one with a personalised "rescue" number plate]]
At night or when the helicopter is offline  the medical crew, including a paramedic and senior trauma doctor, still respond to emergencies, but travel in a specially equipped rapid response car. The six cars, [[Škoda Octavia]]s, occasionally operate during the day, carrying backup medical teams to major incidents, or responding to local incidents or those that occur while the helicopter team is already deployed.

==Funding==
The service costs £2.25 million a year to run, but is only partly funded by the [[National Health Service]]. London's Air Ambulance in a registered charity (number 801013) and the service is funded through charitable donations and corporate donors. A full list of corporate donors is available on the HEMS website. The charity also runs a weekly lottery to raise funds for the service, and holds a number of small and large scale fundraising events throughout the year.

==Missions and major incidents==
During 2009 London's Air Ambulance undertook a total of 1,741 missions, down slightly from 1,771 in 2008. The crews attended the following emergency incidents:
* 672 road [[traffic collision]]s
* 377 falls from height
* 349 stabbings
* 69 shootings

The Air Ambulance team have been involved in many major incidents over the past few years, including the train crashes at [[Cannon Street station rail crash|Cannon Street]], [[Southall rail crash|Southall]] and [[Ladbroke Grove rail crash|Paddington]]; and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July 2005 terrorist attacks]], when the HEMS team carried out 26 missions using the helicopter and constant deployment of rapid response cars to deliver medical care and supplies to the scenes of the bombings. This was only possible because a meeting, attended by many current and former HEMS staff, was coincidentally scheduled for the same day. 208 people were treated at the Royal London Hospital on that day. HEMS holds a contract with the London Ambulance Service obliging them to provide medical oversight at declared major incidents.

==Crew==
The crew usually consists of one pilot, one co-pilot, one doctor and one paramedic. There is occasionally an observer, who is a doctor or paramedic in training.

==Ground services==
On arrival at the Royal London Hospital helipad, specialist ground crew receive the patient and a dedicated, express elevator carries the patient to the [[emergency department|accident and emergency department]] on the ground floor&mdash;where a [[trauma team]] with A&E doctors, general [[surgeon]]s, specialist trauma surgeons, and [[anesthesiologist]]s assemble to assess and treat them.

==Television appearances==
In 2004 the service was featured heavily in the [[BBC]] television series ''Trauma''.<ref>[http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/formedia/press/release.asp?id=136 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> In 2009 a standalone documentary about the Air Ambulance was made for the BBC by [[North One Television]]. It showcased the service in a number of emergencies and was called ''Medic One: Life and death in London''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00l1w31 |title=BBC One - Medic One - Life and Death in London |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>
In 1994 they featured in a special episode of the BBC series ''[[999 (BBC TV series)|999]]'' entitled The Flying Doctors.

==Administration==
[[Image:Dr-Gareth11891.jpg|thumb|HEMS Clinical Director Dr Gareth Davies]]
The HEMS Clinical Director is [[Gareth Davies (doctor)|Dr. Gareth Davies]]. Davies is also an Accident & Emergency and Pre-hospital Care Consultant working at the Royal London Hospital and regularly flies in the helicopter to the scenes of accidents.

Concerns were expressed in the media after the London Air Ambulance charity dismissed its Chief Executive in 2009.<ref>Laura Donnelly and Alison Moore, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6677977/Air-ambulance-chief-sacked-after-he-raised-financial-concerns.html Air ambulance chief sacked after he raised financial concerns], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 November 2009</ref> The [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] promptly made recommendations on [[Corporate governance|governance]] to the [[Trustee]]s, but did not express an opinion over the dismissal.<ref>Tania Mason, [http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/5880/charity_commission_clears_air_ambulance_charity Charity Commission provides governance advice to air ambulance charity], ''Civil Society'', 20 January 2010</ref>

==Physician Response Unit==
Davies has been responsible for many innovations in pre-hospital care such as the Physician Response Unit (PRU), which brings the doctor to the patient in their home, preventing an unnecessary waste of ambulance resources. The PRU also operates from the Royal London Hospital in a rapid response car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/ourservices/accident_and_emergency.asp |title=Accident and Emergency - Barts and the London NHS Trust |publisher=Bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>

The PRU is staffed by a doctor and an [[Emergency Care Practitioner]] (ECP). Compared to just sending out an ECP in a car or an ambulance crewed by a paramedic and an [[emergency medical technician]], a higher level of diagnostics and treatment can be initiated on-scene, giving the optimal outcome for the patient, and saving expensive procedures that could otherwise have been initiated.
