A '''cancer syndrome''' is a genetic disorder in which [[genetic mutation]]s in one or more [[gene]]s predispose the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Cancer syndromes often show not only a high [[lifetime risk]] of developing cancer, but also the development of multiple independent primary tumors.<ref name="isbn3-527-32028-8">{{cite book |author=Simone Fulda; Heike Allgayer; Helga Rehder |title=Hereditary Tumors: From Genes to Clinical Consequences |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=3-527-32028-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Many of these syndromes are caused by mutations in [[tumor suppressor gene]]s, genes that are involved in protecting the cell from turning cancerous.

[[File:Autosomal dominant.png|thumb|Example pedigree chart of autosomal dominant inheritance. Many cancer syndromes are inherited in this manner.]]

[[File:Autosomal recessive.png|thumb|Less commonly, cancer syndromes are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In this example pedigree chart the only person that will have an increased risk of cancer is the homozygous recessive male in the second generation; although there are many carriers of the gene.]]

Two copies of every gene are present in all cells of the body and each one is called an [[allele]]. Most cancer syndromes are transmitted in a [[Mendelian inheritance|mendelian]] [[autosomal dominant]] manner. In these cases, only one faulty allele has to be present for an individual to have a predisposition to cancer. Individuals with one normal allele and one faulty allele are known as [[heterozygous]]. A heterozygous individual and a person with two normal alleles ([[homozygous]]) will have a 50% chance of producing an affected child.<ref name="isbn0-7817-6250-2"/> The mutation in the inherited gene is known as a [[germline mutation]] and a further mutation in the normal allele results in the development of cancer. This is known as Knudson's two hit hypothesis, where the first hit of the gene is the inherited mutation and the second hit occurs later in life.<ref name="pmid18196605"/> As only one allele needs to be mutated (as compared to both in so called "sporadic cancers"), the individual has a higher chance of developing the cancer than the general population.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Less often, syndromes may be transmitted as an [[autosomal recessive]] trait. Both alleles of a gene must be mutated in autosomal recessive disorders for an individual to have a predisposition to cancer. A person with two recessive alleles is known as [[homozygous recessive]] . Both parents must have at least one faulty allele in order for a child to be homozygous recessive. If both parents have one mutant allele and one normal allele ([[heterozygous]]) then they have a 25% chance of producing a homozygous recessive child (has predisposition), 50% chance of producing a heterozygous child (carrier of the faulty gene) and 25% chance of produced a child with two normal alleles.<ref name="isbn0-7817-6250-2">{{cite book |author=Anderson, Cindy Lou; Carie A Braun |title=Pathophysiology: functional alterations in human health |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-6250-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Syndromes==
===Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer===
[[Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome]] (HBOC) is an [[autosomal dominant]] [[genetic disorder]] caused by [[genetic mutation]]s of the [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] genes. In women this disorder primarily increases the risk of [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[ovarian cancer]], but also increases the risk of [[fallopian tube cancer|fallopian tube carcinoma]] and papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum. In men the risk of [[prostate cancer]] is increased. Other cancers that are inconsistently linked to this syndrome are [[pancreatic cancer]], [[male breast cancer]], [[colorectal cancer]] and cancers of the [[uterine cancer|uterus]] and [[cervical cancer|cervix]]. Genetic mutations account for approximately 7% and 14% of breast and ovarian cancer, respectively, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for 80% of these cases. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are both [[tumour supressor gene]]s implicated in maintaining and repairing DNA. Mutations in these genes allow further damage to DNA, which can lead to cancer.<ref name="pmid20216074">{{cite journal |author=Petrucelli N, Daly MB, Feldman GL |title=Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer due to mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 |journal=Genet.

===Li-Fraumeni syndrome===
[[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]] is an [[autosomal dominant]] syndrome primarily caused by [[genetic mutation|mutation]]s in the [[TP53 gene]], which greatly increases the risk of many cancers and is also highly associated with early onset of these cancers. Cancers linked to this disorder include; [[soft tissue sarcoma]]s (often found in childhood), [[osteosarcoma]], [[breast cancer]], [[brain cancer]], [[leukaemia]] and [[adrenocortical carcinoma]]. Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome often have multiple independent primary cancers. The reason for the large clinical spectrum of this disorder may be due to other gene mutations that modify the disease. The protein produced by the TP53 gene, p53, is involved in [[cell cycle checkpoint|cell cycle arrest]], [[DNA repair]] and [[apoptosis]]. Defective p53 may not be able to properly perform these processes, which may be the reason for tumor formation. Because only 60-80% of individuals with the disorder have detectable mutations in TP53, other mutations in the p53 pathway may be involved in Li-Fraumeni syndrome.<ref name="pmid21779515">{{cite journal |author=Malkin D |title=Li-fraumeni syndrome |journal=Genes Cancer |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=475–84 |year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21779515 |pmc=3135649 |doi=10.1177/1947601911413466 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bakry|first=D|title=P53 in the Clinic: TP53 Germline Mutations: Genetics of Li–Fraumeni Syndrome|year=2013|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-3676-8|pages=167-188}}</ref><ref name="pmid7987644">{{cite journal |author=Birch JM |title=Familial cancer syndromes and clusters |journal=Br.

===Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer===
[[Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer]] (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, is an [[autosomal dominant]] cancer syndrome that increases the risk of colorectal cancer. It is caused by genetic mutations in [[DNA mismatch repair]] (MMR) genes, notably [[MLH1]], [[MSH2]], [[MSH6]] and [[PMS2]]. In addition to colorectal cancer many other cancers are increased in frequency. These include; [[endometrial cancer]], [[stomach cancer]], [[ovarian cancer]], cancers of the small bowel and [[pancreatic cancer]]. HNPCC is also associated with and early onset of colorectal cancer. MMR genes are involved in repairing DNA when the [[DNA bases|bases]] on each strand of DNA do not match. Defective MMR genes allow continuous [[insertion mutation|insertion]] and  [[deletion mutation|deletion]] mutations in regions of DNA known as [[microsatellites]]. These short repetitive sequences of DNA become unstable, leading to a state of [[microsatellite instability]] (MSI). Mutated microsatellites are often found in genes involved in tumor initiation and progression, and MSI can enhance the survival of cells, leading to cancer.<ref name="pmid19659756">{{cite journal |author=Lynch HT, Lynch PM, Lanspa SJ, Snyder CL, Lynch JF, Boland CR |title=Review of the Lynch syndrome: history, molecular genetics, screening, differential diagnosis, and medicolegal ramifications |journal=Clin.

[[File:sex linked inheritance.png|thumb|Although the majority of Fanconi anemia cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, those caused by FANCB are inherited through x-linked recessive inheritance. This example pedigree chart shows how inheritance of x-linked Fanconi anemia might occur through several generations.]]
===Fanconi anemia===
[[Fanconi anemia]] (FA) is a disorder with a wide clinical spectrum, including: early onset and increased risk of cancer; [[bone marrow failure]]; and [[congenital abnormality|congenital abnormalities]]. The most prominent manifestations of this disorder are those related to [[hematopoeisis]] (production of blood by the [[bone marrow]]); these include [[aplastic anemia]], [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] and [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. [[Hepatic tumor]]s and [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s of the [[esophagus]], [[oropharynx]] and [[uvula]] are solid tumours commonly linked to FA. Congenital abnormalities include: skeletal anomalies (especially those affecting the hands), [[cafe au lait spot]]s and [[hypopigmentation]]. To date, the genes known to cause FA are: [[FANCA]], [[FANCB]], [[FANCC]], [[FANCD2]], [[FANCE]], [[FANCF]], [[FANCG]], [[FANCI]], [[FANCJ]], [[FANCL]], [[FANCM]], [[FANCN]], [[RAD51C|FANCO]], [[FANCP]] and [[BRCA2]] (previously known as FANCD1). Inheritance of this syndrome is primarily [[autosomal recessive]], but FANCB can be inherited from the maternal or paternal [[x-chromosome]] ([[x-linked recessive inheritance]]). The FA pathway is involved in DNA repair when the two strands of DNA are incorrectly joined together ([[Crosslinking of DNA|interstrand crosslink]]s). Many pathways are coordinated by the FA pathway for this including; [[nucleotide excision repair]], [[translesion synthesis]] and [[homologous recombination]].<ref name="pmid19686080">{{cite journal |author=Moldovan GL, D'Andrea AD |title=How the fanconi anemia pathway guards the genome |journal=Annu.

===Familial adenomatous polyposis===
[[Familial adenomatous polyposis]] (FAP) is an [[autosomal dominant]] syndrome that massively increases the risk of [[colorectal cancer]]. Around 1 in 8000 people will have this disease and it has approximately 100% [[penetrance]]. An individual with this disease will have hundreds to thousands of [[benign tumor|benign]] [[adenoma]]s throughout their [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], which will in most cases progress to cancer. Other tumors increased in frequency include; [[osteoma]]s, adrenal [[adrenal adenoma|adenoma]]s and [[adrenal carcinoma|carcinoma]]s, thyroid tumors and [[desmoid tumor]]s. The cause of this disorder is a mutated [[APC gene]], which is involved in [[β-catenin]] regulation. Faulty APC causes β-catenin to accumulate in cells and activate [[transcription factor]]s involved in [[cell proliferation]], [[cell migration|migration]], [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] and [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death).<ref name="pmid19822006">{{cite journal|author=Half E, Bercovich D, Rozen P |title=Familial adenomatous polyposis |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=4|issue= |pages=22 |year=2009 |pmid=19822006 |pmc=2772987 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-4-22 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid16454848">{{cite journal |author=Galiatsatos P, Foulkes WD |title=Familial adenomatous polyposis |journal=Am.

===MUTYH-associated polyposis===
MUTYH-associated polyposis shares most of its clinical features with FAP; the difference is that it's an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder caused by mutations in the [[MUTYH]] [[DNA repair]] gene. Tumors with increased risk in this disorder are colorectal cancer, gastric adenomas and duodenal adenomas.<ref name="pmid19414147">{{cite journal|author=Sampson JR, Jones N |title=MUTYH-associated polyposis |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=23|issue=2 |pages=209–18 |year=2009 |pmid=19414147 |doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2009.03.006 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19822006">{{cite journal |author=Half E, Bercovich D, Rozen P |title=Familial adenomatous polyposis|journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=4 |issue= |pages=22 |year=2009 |pmid=19822006 |pmc=2772987|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-4-22 |url=}}</ref>

[[File:Keratocystic_odontogenic_tumour - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing [[keratocystic odontogenic tumour]], a common finding in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. [[H&E stain]].]]
===Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome===

[[Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]] (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome, is an [[autosomal dominant]] cancer syndrome in which the risk of [[basal cell carcinoma]] is very high. The disease is characterized by [[basal cell]] [[nevus|nevi]], jaw [[keratocyst]]s and skeletal abnormalities. Estimates of NBCCS prevalence varies, but is approximately 1 in 60000. The presence of basal cell carcinoma is much higher in white than black individuals; 80% and 38%, respectively. [[Odontogenic  keratocyst]]s are found in approximately 75% of individuals with the disease and often occur early in life. The most common skeletal abnormalities occur in the head and face, but other areas are often affected such as the [[human rib cage|rib cage]]. The causative [[genetic mutation]] of this disease occurs in the [[PTCH1|PTCH gene]], and the product of PTCH is a [[tumor suppressor]] involved in [[cell signaling]]. Although the exact role of this protein in NBCCS is not known, it is involved in the [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], known to control [[cell growth]] and development.<ref name="pmid15050066">{{cite journal |author=Manfredi M, Vescovi P, Bonanini M, Porter S |title=Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome: a review of the literature |journal=Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=117–24 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15050066 |doi=10.1054/ijom.2003.0435 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19032739">{{cite journal |author=Lo Muzio L |title=Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=3 |issue= |pages=32 |year=2008 |pmid=19032739 |pmc=2607262 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-3-32 |url=}}</ref>

===Xeroderma pigmentosum===

[[Xeroderma pigmentosum]] (XP) is one of the few [[autosomal recessive]] cancer disorders and is very rare; with prevalences that differ from country to country. The disease is characterized by sensitivity to [[ultra-violet light|ultra-violet (UV) light]], massively increased risk of [[sunburn]] and increased risk of [[skin cancer]]s. The risk of skin cancer is more than 10000 times that of normal individuals and includes many types of skin cancer, including [[melanoma]] and non-melanoma skin cancers. Also, sun exposed areas of the tongue, lips and eyes have an increased risk of becoming cancerous. In addition to cancer, some [[genetic mutation]]s that cause XP are associated with [[neurodegeneration]]. XP may be caused by genetic mutations in 8 genes, which produce the following [[enzyme]]s: [[XPA]], [[XPB]], [[XPC (gene)|XPC]], [[ERCC2|XPD]], [[DDB1|XPE]], [[ERCC4|XPF]], [[ERCC5|XPG]] and [[DNA polymerase eta|Pol η]]. XPA-XPF  are  [[nucleotide excision repair]] enzymes that repair UV light-damaged DNA and faulty proteins will allow the build up of mutations caused by UV light. Pol η is a [[polymerase]], which are enzymes that are involved in DNA replication. There are many polymerases, but pol η is the enzyme that replicates UV light-damaged DNA. Mutations in this gene will produce a faulty pol η enzyme that cannot replicate DNA with UV light damage. Individuals with mutations of this gene have a subset of XP; XP-variant disease.<ref name="pmid22044607">{{cite journal |author=Lehmann AR, McGibbon D, Stefanini M |title=Xeroderma pigmentosum |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=6 |issue= |pages=70 |year=2011 |pmid=22044607 |pmc=3221642 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-70 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21708183">{{cite journal |author=Niedernhofer LJ, Bohr VA, Sander M, Kraemer KH |title=Xeroderma pigmentosum and other diseases of human premature aging and DNA repair: molecules to patients |journal=Mech.
