'''Cardiac catheterization''' ('''heart cath''') is the insertion of a [[catheter]] into a [[heart chamber|chamber]] or [[Blood vessel|vessel]] of the [[heart]]. This is done for both diagnostic and interventional purposes. Subsets of this technique are mainly [[coronary catheterization]], involving the catheterization of the [[coronary arteries]], and catheterization of cardiac chambers and valves.

==Coronary catheterization==
{{Main|Coronary catheterization}}
<!--[[Image:Hk coronary big bionerd.gif|thumb|''Coronary catheterization'' - Visualization of the coronary arteries (in this case, the [[left coronary artery]] which gives the [[circumflex branch of left coronary artery]]).]]-->
===Procedure===
[[Local anaesthetic]] is injected into the skin to numb the area. A puncture is then made with a needle in either the [[femoral artery]] in the [[groin]] or the [[radial artery puncture|radial artery]] in the wrist, ([[Seldinger technique]]), before a guidewire is inserted into the arterial puncture.  A plastic sheath (with a stiffer plastic introducer inside it) is then threaded over the wire and pushed into the artery. The wire is then removed and the side-port of the sheath is aspirated to ensure arterial blood flows back.  It is then flushed with saline. This arterial sheath, with a bleedback prevention valve, acts as a conduit into the artery for the duration of the procedure. 

Catheters are inserted using a guidewire and moved towards the heart.  Once in position above the [[aortic valve]] the guidewire is then removed.  The catheter is then engaged with the origin of the coronary artery (either [[left coronary artery]] or [[right coronary artery]]) and x-ray opaque [[iodine]]-based contrast is injected to make the coronary vessels show up on the [[Fluoroscopy|x-ray fluoroscopy]] image.

When the necessary procedures are complete, the catheter is removed. Firm pressure is applied to the site to prevent bleeding.  This may be done by hand or with a mechanical device.  Other closure techniques include an internal suture and plug.  If the femoral artery was used, the patient will probably be asked to lie flat for several hours to prevent bleeding or the development of a [[hematoma]]. If the arm is used, the patient can ambulate sooner. Cardiac interventions such as the insertion of a [[stent]] prolong both the procedure itself as well as the post-catheterization time spent in allowing the wound to clot.  
However, the femoral artery is associated with local complication in up to 3% of patients{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and hence, more interventional physicians are moving towards the radial (wrist) artery, as an alternative site. Disadvantages of the [[radial artery]] include small vessel caliber and a different "learning curve" for physicians used to the femoral (groin) access.


"Cardiac catheterization" is a general term for a group of procedures that are performed using this method, such as [[coronary angiography]], as well as left ventricle angiography. Once the catheter is in place, it can be used to perform a number of procedures including [[angioplasty]], PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) [[angiography]], [[balloon septostomy]], and an [[Electrophysiology study]] or [[Catheter ablation]].

===Indications for diagnostic use===
This technique has several goals:
*confirm the presence of a suspected [[Heart disease|heart ailment]]
*quantify the severity of the disease and its effect on the heart
*seek out the cause of a symptom such as [[Dyspnea|shortness of breath]] or signs of [[Congestive heart failure|cardiac insufficiency]]
*make a patient assessment prior to [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]]

===Investigative techniques used with coronary catheterization===
*to measure intracardiac and [[Circulatory system|intravascular]] [[blood pressure]]s
*to take tissue samples for [[biopsy]]<!--in French, the article literally says "to take blood samples", but that seems like a a complicated method just to draw blood. Maybe I'm missing something here.-->
*to inject various agents for measuring blood flow in the heart; also to detect and quantify the presence of an intracardiac [[shunt (medical)|shunt]]
*to inject [[Radiocontrast|contrast agents]] in order to study the shape of the heart vessels and chambers and how they change as the heart beats

==Catheterization of chambers and valves==
<!--[[Image:Hk lv big bionerd.gif|thumb|''Catheterization of a cardiac chamber'', in this case the left ventricle (a ventriculogram).]]-->
Catheterization of cardiac chambers and [[cardiac valve|valves]] may be performed in the same round as a coronary catheterization, and may also involve nearby major vessels, such as the [[aorta]]. It is the main method of [[cardiac ventriculography]] (another being [[radionuclide ventriculography]], whose use has largely been replaced by [[echocardiography]]).

It has the ability to measure the [[pressure gradient]] across a valve and derive valve area from it. Thereby, it can assist in diagnosis of, for example, [[aortic stenosis]].<ref name=agabegi2nd>{{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

This is also the procedure used in [[balloon septostomy]], which is the widening of a [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], [[patent foramen ovale]] (''PFO''), or [[atrial septal defect]] (''ASD'') using a [[balloon catheter]].

==History==
{{See|History of invasive and interventional cardiology}}

The history of cardiac catheterization dates back to [[Claude Bernard]] (1813-1878), who used it on animal models. Clinical application of cardiac catheterization begins with [[Werner Forssmann]] in the 1930s, who inserted a catheter into the vein of his own forearm, guided it fluoroscopically into his right atrium, and took an [[X-ray]] picture of it. Forssmann won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for this achievement, though hospital administrators removed him from his position owing to his unorthodox methods. During [[World War II]], [[André Frédéric Cournand]], a professor at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] who also shared the Nobel Prize, and his colleagues developed techniques for left and right heart catheterization.
