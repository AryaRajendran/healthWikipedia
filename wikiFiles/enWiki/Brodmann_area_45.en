'''Brodmann area 45''' ('''BA45'''), is part of the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] in the [[human brain]]. Situated on the lateral surface, inferior to [[Brodmann area 9|BA9]] and adjacent to [[Brodmann area 46|BA46]]. 

This area is also known as '''pars triangular (of the inferior frontal gyrus)'''. In the human, it occupies the triangular part of [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (H) and, surrounding the anterior horizontal limb of [[lateral sulcus]] (H), a portion of the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (H). Bounded caudally by the anterior ascending limb of lateral sulcus (H), it borders on the [[Insular cortex|insula]] in the depth of the lateral sulcus. 

In terms of [[cytoarchitecture]], it is bounded caudally by the [[Brodmann area 44|opercular area 44]] (BA44), rostrodorsally by the [[Brodmann area 46|middle frontal area 46]] (BA46), and ventrally by the [[Brodmann area 47|orbital area 47]] (BA47) (Brodmann-1909). 

==Functions== 
Together with BA 44, it comprises [[Broca's area]], a region that is active in [[Semantics|semantic]] tasks, such as semantic decision tasks (determining whether a word represents an abstract or a concrete entity) and generation tasks (generating a [[verb]] associated with a [[noun]]). 

The precise role of BA45 in semantic tasks remains controversial. For some researchers, its role would be to subserve semantic retrieval or semantic working memory processes. Under this view, BA44 and BA45 would together guide recovery of semantic information and evaluate the recovered information with regard to the criterion appropriate to a given context.<ref>{{Cite journal
