'''Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor''' ('''G-CSF''' or '''GCSF''') is a [[colony-stimulating factor]] hormone. G-CSF is also known as '''colony-stimulating factor 3''' ('''CSF 3''').

It is a [[glycoprotein]], [[growth factor]] and [[cytokine]] produced by a number of different [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] to stimulate the [[bone marrow]] to produce [[granulocyte]]s and [[stem cell]]s. G-CSF then stimulates the bone marrow to release them into the blood. 

G-CSF also stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of [[neutrophil]] precursors and mature neutrophils. G-CSF regulates them using [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)]] and Ras /[[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK) and [[phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase]] (PI3K)/[[protein kinase B]] (Akt) signal transduction pathway.

== Discovery ==
Mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was first recognised and purified in [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute]], [[Australia]] in 1983,<ref name="pmid2990035">{{cite journal | author = Metcalf D | title = The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors | journal = Science | volume = 229 | issue = 4708 | pages = 16–22 | year = 1985 | month = July | pmid = 2990035 | doi = 10.1126/science.2990035 | url =  }}</ref> and the human form was cloned by groups from [[Japan]] and the [[Germany]]/[[United States]] in 1986.<ref name="pmid3484805">{{cite journal | author = Nagata S, Tsuchiya M, Asano S, Kaziro Y, Yamazaki T, Yamamoto O, Hirata Y, Kubota N, Oheda M, Nomura H | title = Molecular cloning and expression of cDNA for human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor | journal = Nature | volume = 319 | issue = 6052 | pages = 415–8 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3484805 | doi = 10.1038/319415a0 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid2420009">{{cite journal | author = Souza LM, Boone TC, Gabrilove J, Lai PH, Zsebo KM, Murdock DC, Chazin VR, Bruszewski J, Lu H, Chen KK, Barendt J, Platzer, E, Moore, MAS, Mertelsmann R, Welte K | title = Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: effects on normal and leukemic myeloid cells | journal = Science | volume = 232 | issue = 4746 | pages = 61–5 | year = 1986 | month = April | pmid = 2420009 | doi = 10.1126/science.2420009 | url =   }}</ref>

== Biological function ==
G-CSF is produced by [[endothelium]], [[macrophage]]s, and a number of other [[immune system|immune]] cells. The natural human glycoprotein exists in two forms, a 174- and 180-[[amino acid|amino-acid]]-long [[protein]] of molecular weight 19,600&nbsp;grams per mole. The more-abundant and more-active 174-amino acid form has been used in the development of pharmaceutical products by [[recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) technology.

The [[Receptor (biochemistry)|G-CSF-receptor]] is present on precursor cells in the [[bone marrow]], and, in response to stimulation by G-CSF, initiates proliferation and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] into mature [[granulocyte]]s. G-CSF is also a potent inducer of HSCs mobilization from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, although it has been shown that it does not directly affect the hematopoietic progenitors that are mobilized.<ref name="pmid11953662">{{cite journal | author = Thomas J, Liu F, Link DC | title = Mechanisms of mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor | journal = Curr. Opin. Hematol. | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–9 | year = 2002 | month = May | pmid = 11953662 | doi = 10.1097/00062752-200205000-00002| url = | issn = }}</ref>

Beside the effect on the hematopoietic system, G-CSF can also act on neuronal cells as a neurotrophic factor. Indeed, its receptor is expressed by neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The action of G-CSF in the central nervous system is to induce [[neurogenesis]], to increase the [[neuroplasticity]] and to counteract [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid16007267">{{cite journal | author = Schneider A, Krüger C, Steigleder T, Weber D, Pitzer C, Laage R, Aronowski J, Maurer MH, Gassler N, Mier W, Hasselblatt M, Kollmar R, Schwab S, Sommer C, Bach A, Kuhn HG, Schäbitz WR | title = The hematopoietic factor G-CSF is a neuronal ligand that counteracts programmed cell death and drives neurogenesis | journal = J.

==Genetics==
The gene for G-CSF is located on [[chromosome]] 17, locus q11.2-q12. Nagata et al. found that the GCSF gene has 4 [[intron]]s, and that 2 different [[polypeptide]]s are synthesized from the same gene by differential splicing of mRNA.<ref name="pmid3484805"/>
<!-- <ref name="N86">{{cite journal |author=Nagata S, Tsuchiya M, Asano S, ''et al.'' |title=Molecular cloning and expression of cDNA for human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=6052 |pages=415–8 |year=1986 |pmid=3484805 |doi=10.1038/319415a0}}</ref> -->

The 2 polypeptides differ by the presence or absence of 3 amino acids. Expression studies indicate that both have authentic GCSF activity.

It is thought that stability of the G-CSF mRNA is regulated by an RNA element called the [[G-CSF factor stem-loop destabilising element]].

== Therapeutic use ==
G-CSF stimulates the production of white blood cells (WBC). In [[oncology]] and [[hematology]], a recombinant form of G-CSF is used with certain cancer patients to accelerate recovery from [[neutropenia]] after [[chemotherapy]], allowing higher-intensity treatment regimens. Chemotherapy can cause [[myelosuppression]] and unacceptably low levels of [[white blood cell]]s, making patients susceptible to [[infection]]s and [[sepsis]].

G-CSF is also used to increase the number of [[hematopoietic stem cells]] in the blood of the donor before collection by [[leukapheresis]] for use in [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. It may also be given to the receiver, to compensate for [[conditioning regimens]].

[[Itescu]] planned in 2004 to use G-CSF to treat heart degeneration by injecting it into the blood-stream, plus [[stromal cell-derived factor-1|SDF]] (stromal cell-derived factor) directly to the heart.<ref name="isbn0-7333-1248-9">{{cite book | author = Finkel, Elizabeth | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Stem cells: controversy on the frontiers of science | edition = | language = | publisher = ABC Books | location = Crows Nest | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-7333-1248-9 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

A [[Washington University School of Medicine]] study in mice has shown that G-CSF may decrease [[bone mineral density]].<ref name="pmid17192391">{{cite journal | author = Hirbe AC, Uluçkan O, Morgan EA, Eagleton MC, Prior JL, Piwnica-Worms D, Trinkaus K, Apicelli A, Weilbaecher K | title = Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor enhances bone tumor growth in mice in an osteoclast-dependent manner | journal = Blood | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | pages = 3424–31 | year = 2007 | month = April | pmid = 17192391 | pmc = 1852257 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-09-048686 | url =  }}</ref>

Due to its neuroprotective properties, G-CSF is currently under investigation for [[cerebral ischemia]] in a clinical phase IIb <ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00927836</ref> and several clinical pilot studies are published for other neurological disease such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].<ref>Zang Y et al. Amyotroph Lateral Scler. 2008 Dec 4:1-2 Preliminary investigation of effect of granulocyte colony stimulating factor on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</ref>

[[Sweet's syndrome]] is a known side effect of using this drug.<ref name="pmid7504506">{{cite journal | author = Paydaş S, Sahin B, Seyrek E, Soylu M, Gonlusen G, Acar A, Tuncer I | title = Sweet's syndrome associated with G-CSF | journal = Br.

It was first marketed by [[Amgen]] with the brand name [[Neupogen]]. Several bio-generic versions are now also available in markets such as Europe and Australia.

The recombinant human G-CSF synthesised in an ''[[E. coli]]'' expression system is called [[filgrastim]]. The structure of filgrastim differs slightly from the structure of the natural glycoprotein. Most published studies have used filgrastim. Filgrastim (Neupogen) and [[Pegfilgrastim|PEG-filgrastim]] (Neulasta) are two commercially-available forms of rhG-CSF (recombinant human G-CSF). The PEG ([[polyethylene glycol]]) form has a much longer [[half-life]], reducing the necessity of daily injections.

Another form of recombinant human G-CSF called [[lenograstim]] is synthesised in [[Chinese Hamster Ovary cell]]s (CHO cells). As this is a mammalian cell expression system, lenograstim is indistinguishable from the 174-amino acid natural human G-CSF. No clinical or therapeutic consequences of the differences between filgrastim and lenograstim have yet been identified, but there are no formal comparative studies.

G-CSF when given early after exposure to radiation may improve white blood cell counts, and is stockpiled for use in radiation incidents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weisdorf D, Chao N, Waselenko JK, ''et al.'' |title=Acute radiation injury: contingency planning for triage, supportive care, and transplantation |journal=Biol.
