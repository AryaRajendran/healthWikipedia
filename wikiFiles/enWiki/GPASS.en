'''GPASS''', '''General Practice Administration System for Scotland''', originally developed by a Scottish General Medical Practitioner and Software developer, Dr. Ferguson, currently owned by the [[Scottish Government]] and developed and supported by the [[NHS Scotland|NHS]] [[Common Services Agency of Scotland]]. 

Widely used (85% of all Scottish general medical practices) clinical record and practice administration software in Scottish General medical Practices. 
Originally [[BASIC]] based, GPASS was redeveloped in [[UNIX]] and then moved in the mid-1990s as ''NewGPASS'' onto a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platform. It is currently at version 5.7. An additional interface, ''GPASS Clinical'', is in active development.

Its development has often been criticised as sluggish and lagging behind other more sophisticated systems like [[Egton Medical Information Systems|EMIS]] and Vision. Many of its supporters though cite its public ownership as a positivum.

In Spring 2006 a decision was reached by the Scottish GP representatives (the [[British Medical Association]]'s Scottish LMC conference) to call for immediate abandonment of any further development as the software was hopelessly out of date and "not fit for purpose". The [[Scottish Executive]] dismissed in a report to parliament some of these complaints as secondary to inadequate hardware rather than inherent problems within the software.

In November 2006 a report to the Scottish Executive from Deloitte on ''General Practice Information Technology Options'' recommended a move to commercial alternatives. However, the report noted that currently available commercial systems were no more suitable for purpose than GPASS. Further, it was noted that no single supplier of clinical database systems is likely to be able to meet the requirements of the Scottish Executive as at the time of the report's publication.  

The Scottish Government made the decision to retire the GPASS system and in July 2009 a procurement was started with the intent of finding suitable commercial systems to replace GPASS. The planned date for retiral of the GPASS service is March 2012.
