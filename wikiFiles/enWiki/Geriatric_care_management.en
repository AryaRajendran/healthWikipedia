It entails working with persons of [[old age]] and their families in managing, rendering and [[Referral (business)|referring]] various types of health and social care services.<ref name="Cress">Cress, Cathy Jo. ''Handbook of Geriatric Care Management.'' Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2010.</ref> '''Geriatric care managers''' accomplish this by combining a working knowledge of health and psychology, human development, family dynamics, public and private resources and funding sources, while advocating for their clients throughout the [[continuum of care]]. For example, they may assist families of older adults and others with chronic needs such as those suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]] or other [[dementia]].<ref name="Professional">National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers.

==Overview==
Geriatric care management integrates [[health care]] and psychological care with other needed services such as: housing, [[home care]] services, [[nutrition]]al services, assistance with [[activities of daily living]], socialization programs, as well as financial and legal planning (e.g. banking, [[trusts]]). A [[Nursing care plan|care plan]] tailored for specific circumstances is prepared after an individual assessment, and is continuously monitored and modified as needed.<ref>SeniorMag.com.

==Geriatric care managers==
Geriatric care managers typically have prior training in [[nursing]], [[social work]], [[gerontology]] or other health service areas.<ref name="Cress"/> They are expected to have extensive knowledge about the costs, quality, and availability of services in their communities. In some countries and jurisdictions, they may obtain [[certification]] from various professional associations, such as the ''National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers''<ref name="Professional"/> in the United States.

Professional care managers help individuals, families and other [[caregiver]]s adjust and cope with the challenges of aging or disability by:
* Conducting care-planning assessments to identify needs, problems and eligibility for assistance;
* Screening, arranging, and monitoring in-home help and other services;
* Reviewing financial, legal, or medical issues;
* Offering referrals to specialists to avoid future problems and to conserve assets;
* Providing crisis intervention;
* Acting as a liaison to families at a distance;
* Making sure things are going well and alerting families of problems;
* Assisting with moving their clients to or from a retirement complex, [[assisted living facility]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] facility or [[nursing home]];
* Providing client and family education and [[advocacy]];
* Offering [[counseling]] and support.

Depending on the country and [[health care system|health care organization]], professional fees for the services of geriatic care managers may be  billed privately on a [[fee-for-service]] basis. In the United States, they are not covered by [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] nor by most private [[health insurance]] policies. However, clients may be able to bill some services to [[long term care insurance]], depending on the history of the individual case.
