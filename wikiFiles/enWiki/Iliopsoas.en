The term '''iliopsoas''' refers to the combination of the [[psoas major muscle|psoas major]] and the [[iliacus muscle|iliacus]] at their inferior ends. These muscles are distinct in the [[abdomen]], but usually indistinguishable in the [[thigh]]. As such, they are usually given the common name "iliopsoas" and are referred to as the "dorsal hip muscles"<ref name="Platzer-234">Platzer (2004), p 234</ref> or "inner hip muscles".<ref name="Thieme-atlas-422-423">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), pp 422-523</ref> The [[psoas minor muscle|psoas minor]] does not contribute to the iliopsoas muscle.

== Origin ==
The psoas major originates along the lateral surfaces of the [[Body of vertebra|vertebral bodies]] of T12 and L1-L5 and their associated [[intervertebral discs]].
The iliacus originates in the [[iliac fossa]] of the [[pelvis]].<ref name="Thieme-atlas-422-423" />

== Insertion ==
The psoas major unites with the iliacus at the level of the [[inguinal ligament]] and crosses the hip joint to insert on the [[lesser trochanter]] of the femur.

== Innervation ==
The psoas major is innervated by direct branches off the [[lumbar plexus]] at the levels of L1 and L2, while the iliacus is innervated by the [[femoral nerve]] (which is composed of nerves from the [[anterior rami]] of L2-L4).

== Properties ==
The iliopsoas is the strongest of the [[hip flexors]] (others are [[rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]], [[sartorius muscle|sartorius]], and [[tensor fasciae latae]]). The iliopsoas is important for [[standing]], [[walking]], and [[running]].<ref name="Thieme-atlas-422-423" /> The iliacus and psoas major perform different actions when postural changes occur.

It is, however, a typical posture muscle dominated by [[Skeletal muscle#Skeletal muscle fiber types|slow-twitch red type 1 fibers]]. Therefore, it is susceptible to [[Pathology|pathological]] shortening or [[contracture]], especially in older people with a [[sedentary lifestyle]], and requires regular [[stretching]] to maintain normal [[muscle tone|tone]].  Such shortening can lead to increased anterior [[pelvic tilt]] and [[lumbar spine|lumbar]] [[lordosis]] (unilateral shortening), and limitation of hip extension (bilateral weakness).<ref name="Thieme-atlas-422-423" />

The iliopsoas muscle is covered by the [[iliopsoas fascia]], which begins as a strong tube-shaped [[psoas fascia]], which surround the psoas major muscle as it passes under the [[medial arcuate ligament]].  Together with the [[iliac fascia]], it continues down to the [[inguinal ligament]] where it forms the [[iliopectineal arch]] which separates the [[muscular lacuna|muscular]] and [[vascular lacuna]]e.<ref name="Platzer-254">Platzer (2004), p 254</ref>
