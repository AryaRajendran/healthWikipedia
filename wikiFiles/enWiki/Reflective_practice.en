'''Reflective practice''' is "the capacity to reflect on action so as to engage in a process of continuous learning", which, according to the originator of the term, is "one of the defining characteristics of professional practice".<ref>[[Donald Schön|Schön, D.]] (1983) ''The Reflective Practitioner, How Professionals Think In Action'', Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-06878-2. {{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>

According to one definition it involves "paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight".<ref>Bolton, G (2010) ''Reflective Practice, Writing and Professional Development'' (3rd edition), SAGE publications, California. ISBN 1-84860-212-X. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XSNiMpiHuwcC&pg=PR19 p. xix]</ref>

Reflective practice can be an important tool in [[practice-based professional learning]] settings where individuals learning from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal teaching or knowledge transfer, may be the most important source of personal [[professional development]] and improvement.  As such the notion has achieved wide take-up, particularly in professional development for practitioners in the areas of education and healthcare.  The question of how best to learn from experience has wider relevance however, to any [[organizational learning]] environment. In particular, people in leadership positions have a tremendous development opportunity if they engage in reflective practice.

==History and background==
[[File:Donald schon pic.jpg|thumb|right|Professor Emeritus Donald Schön]]
Reflective Practice was introduced by [[Donald Schön]] in his book ''The Reflective Practitioner'' in 1983, however, the concepts underlying '''reflective practice''' are much older. [[John Dewey]] was among the first to write about Reflective Practice with his exploration of experience, interaction and reflection.<ref>Dewey, J. (1933) ''How We Think. A restatement of the relation of reflective thinking to the educative process'' (Revised edition.), Boston: D. C. Heath.  ISBN 0-486-29895-7.</ref> Other researchers such as [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[William James]] and [[Carl Jung]] were developing theories of human learning and development.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Alice Y. |last1=Kolb |first2=David A. |last2=Kolb |year=2005 |title=Learning Styles and Learning Spaces: Enhancing Experiential Learning in Higher Education |journal=Academy of Management Learning & Education |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=193–212 |id = {{citeseerx|10.1.1.127.6489}} |doi=10.5465/AMLE.2005.17268566}}</ref> Marcus Aurelius' Meditations has also been described as an example of reflective practice.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mac Suibhne, S.|year=2009|title='Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you': Marcus Aurelius, reflective practitioner|journal=Reflective Practice|volume=10|issue=4|pages=429–436|doi=10.1080/14623940903138266}}</ref>

Dewey’s works inspired writers such as Donald Schön and David Boud to explore the boundaries of reflective practice. Central to the development of reflective theory was interest in the integration of theory and practice, the cyclic pattern of experience and the conscious application of that learning experience. For the last 30 years, there has been a growing literature and focus around [[experiential learning]] and the development and application of Reflective Practice.Reflective practice also contributes to learning and expressing our own and others' stories (Ivan, 2012). 

Donald Schön’s 1983 book introduces concepts such as ‘reflection on action’ and ‘reflection in-action’ where professionals meet the challenges of their work with a kind of improvisation learned in practice. Reflective Practice has now been widely accepted and used as developmental practices for organisations, networks, and individuals. As Boud ''et al'' state: "Reflection is an important human activity in which people recapture their experience, think about it, mull it over and evaluate it. It is this working with experience that is important in learning."<ref>Boud D, Keogh R and Walker D (1985) ''Reflection, Turning Experience into Learning'', Routledge. ISBN 0-85038-864-3. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BGUOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA19 p. 19]</ref> Reflective Practice can be seen and has been recognised in many teaching and learning scenarios, and the emergence in more recent years of [[blogging]] has been seen as another form of reflection on experience in a technological age.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wopereis |first1=Iwan |last2=Sloep |first2=Peter |last3=Poortman |first3=Sybilla |title=Weblogs as instruments for reflection on action in teacher education |journal=Interactive Learning Environments |volume=18 |pages=245 |year=2010 |doi=10.1080/10494820.2010.500530 |issue=3}}</ref>

==Models of reflective practice==
The concept of Reflective Practice centers around the idea of lifelong learning in which a practitioner analyses experiences in order to learn from them. Reflective Practice is used to promote independent professionals who are continuously engaged in the reflection of situations they encounter in their professional worlds. Several models of reflection exist and are used to draw lessons out of experiences.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Argyris and Schön 1978===
[[File:Steph A & S Model2.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the single and double loop learning model by Argyris and Schön]]
[[File:Steph Model 3.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the reflective model by Schön]]

[[Chris Argyris|Argyris]] and Schön pioneered the idea of single loop and [[double loop learning]] in 1978. The theory was built around the recognition and amendment of a perceived fault or error.<ref>Smith, Mark K. (2001), [http://www.infed.org/thinkers/argyris.htm Chris Argyris], Encyclopaedia of informal education (infed). Web-page accessed 29 November 2010</ref> Single loop learning is when a practitioner or organisation, even after an error has occurred and a correction is made, continues to rely on current strategies, techniques or polices when a situation again comes to light. Double loop learning involves the modification of personal objectives, strategies or policies so that when a similar situation arises a new framing system is employed.<ref>Argyris, C & Schön, D (1978) ''Organization learning: A theory of Action perspective'', Reading, Mass: Addison Wesley. ISBN 0-201-00174-8. {{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>

Schön himself introduced some years later the concept of Reflection-in-action and Reflection-on-action. Reflection-in-action can be described as the ability of a practitioner to ‘think on their feet’, otherwise known as ‘felt-knowing’.<ref>Walkerden, G. (2005) Felt knowing: a foundation for Local Government Practice. In Keen, M., Brown, V. & Dyball, R. (Eds.) ''Social Learning in Environmental Management''. London, Earthscan. ISBN 978-1-84407-183-8.{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref> It revolves around the idea that within any given moment, when faced with a professional issue, a practitioner usually connects with their feelings, emotions and prior experiences to attend to the situation directly. Reflection-on-action on the other hand is the idea that after the experience a practitioner analyses their reaction to the situation and explores the reasons around, and the consequences of, their actions. This is usually conducted though a documented reflection of the situation.<ref>Schön, D (1983) ''The Reflective Practitioner, How Professionals Think In Action'', Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-06878-2 {{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>

===Kolb 1984===
[[File:Steph Kol Model.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the Kolb's reflective model]]

[[David A. Kolb|Kolb]] was highly influenced by the research conducted by Dewey and Piaget in the 1970s. Kolb’s reflective model highlights the concept of experiential learning and is centered around the transformation of information into knowledge. This takes place after the situation has occurred and entails a practitioner reflecting on the experience, gaining a general understanding of the concepts encountered during the experience and then testing these general understandings on a new situation. In this way the knowledge that is gained from a situation is continuously applied and reapplied building on a practitioners prior experiences and knowledge.<ref>Sheilds R.W., D. Aaron, and S. Wall (2001), [http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~daniel_schugurensky/faqs/qa8.html What is Kolb's model of experiential education, and where does it come from?], Questions and Answers on Adult Education, The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto. Web-page accessed 29 November 2010.{{self-published inline|date=October 2010}}</ref>

===Gibbs 1988===
[[File:Steph Gib Model.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the Gibbs Reflective Model]]

[[Graham Gibbs]] discussed the use of '''structured debriefing''' to facilitate the reflection involved in [[David A. Kolb|Kolb's]] "experiential learning cycle". He presents the stages of a full structured debriefing as follows:

* (Initial experience)
* '''Description''':
*: "What happened? Don't make judgements yet or try to draw conclusions; simply describe."
* '''Feelings''':
*: "What were your reactions and feelings? Again don't move on to analysing these yet."
* '''Evaluation''':
*: "What was good or bad about the experience? Make value judgements."
* '''Analysis''':
*: "What sense can you make of the situation? Bring in ideas from outside the experience to help you."
*: "What was really going on?"
*: "Were different people's experiences similar or different in important ways?"
* '''Conclusions (general)''':
*: "What can be concluded, in a general sense, from these experiences and the analyses you have undertaken?"
* '''Conclusions (specific)''':
*: "What can be concluded about your own specific, unique, personal situation or way of working?"
* '''Personal action plans''':
*: "What are you going to do differently in this type of situation next time?"
*: "What steps are you going to take on the basis of what you have learnt?"<ref name="Gibbs 1988 reproduced 2001">Gibbs G.

Gibbs' suggestions are often cited as '''Gibbs' reflective cycle''' or '''Gibbs' model of reflection''' (1988), and simplified into the following six distinct stages:
* Description
* Feelings
* Evaluation
* Analysis
* Conclusions
* Action plan.

===Johns 1995===
[[File:Steph Joh Model2.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the Johns Reflective Model]]

[[Chris Johns (professor of nursing)|Johns]]’ model is a structured mode of reflection that provides a practitioner with a guide to gain greater understanding. It is designed to be carried out through the act of sharing with a colleague or mentor, which enables the experience to become learnt knowledge at a faster rate than reflection alone.<ref>Grech, E. (2004), "[http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_8/Reflective_Practice.html Hegel’s dialectic and reflective practice – a short essay]". ''International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation''. '''8''', 71–73.</ref> Johns highlights the importance of experienced knowledge and the ability of a practitioner to access, understand and put into practice information that has been acquired through empirical means. In order for this to be achieved reflection occurs though ‘looking in’ on ones thoughts and emotions and ‘looking out’ at the situation experienced. Johns draws on the work of Carper (1978) to expand on the notion of ‘looking out’ at an experience.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Barbara A. |last1=Carper |title=Fundamental Patterns of Knowing in Nursing |month=October |year=1978 |journal=Advances in Nursing Science |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–24 |url=http://journals.lww.com/advancesinnursingscience/Citation/1978/10000/Fundamental_Patterns_of_Knowing_in_Nursing.4.aspx}}</ref> Five [[Carper's fundamental patterns of knowing|patterns of knowing]] are incorporated into the guided reflection, having a practitioner analyse the aesthetic, personal, ethical, empirical and the reflexive elements experienced through the situation. Johns’ model is comprehensive and allows for reflection that touches on many important elements.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.1995.22020226.x |last1=Johns |first1=C |title=Framing learning through reflection within Carper's fundamental ways of knowing in nursing |journal=Journal of advanced nursing |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=226–34 |year=1995 |pmid=7593941}}</ref>

===Brookfield 1998===
Critically reflective practitioners constantly research their assumptions by seeing practice through four complimentary lenses: the lens of their autobiography of learners of reflective practice,the lens of learners eyes,the lens of colleagues' perception and the lens of theoretical, philosophical and research literature.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brookfield|first=Stephan|journal=Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Profession|year=1998|volume=18|pages=197–203}}</ref>  Reviewing practice through these lens makes us more aware of the power dynamics that infuse all practice settings It also helps us detect hegemonic assumptions-assumptions that we think are in our own best interests but actually work against us in the long run (BROOKFIELD 1998)  To become critically reflective Brookfield thinks that the four lenses stated above  will reflect back to us stark and differently highlighted picture of who we are and what we do.
Lens 1 Our autobiography as a learner is an important source of insight into practice. As we talk to each other about critical events in our practice, we start to realize that individual crises are usually collectively experienced dilemmas. Analysing our autobiographies allows us to draw insight and meanings for practice on a deep visceral emotional level
Lens 2 Our learners Eyes. seeing ourselves through learners eyes we discover that learners are interpreting our actions in the way that we mean them. But often we are surprised by the diversity of meanings people read into our words and actions. A cardinal principle of seeing ourselves through learners eyes is that ensuring the anonymity of their critical opinions. You have to make students feel safe. Seeing our practice through learners eyes help us teach more responsively
Lens 3 Our colleagues'Experiences. our colleagues serve as critical miirors reflecting back to us images of our actions. talking to colleagues about problems and gaining their perspective increases our chance finding some information that can help our situation. 
lens 4 Theoretical Literature. theory can help us "name"our practice by illuminating the general elements of what we think are idiosyncratic experiences

===Rolfe 2001===
[[File:Steph Rol Model.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the Rolfe Reflective Model]]

[[Gary Rolfe|Rolfe]]’s reflective model is based around [[Terry Borton|Borton]]’s 1970 developmental model.<ref>Borton, T (1970), ''Reach, Touch and Teach''. London, U.K.:Hutchinson. ISBN 0-07-006571-3. {{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref> A simplistic cycle composed of 3 questions which asks the practitioner, What, So What and Now What. Through this analysis a description of the situation is given which then leads into the scrutiny of the situation and the construction of knowledge that has been learnt through the experience. Subsequent to this, ways in which to personally improve and the consequence of ones response to the experience are reflected on.<ref>Rolfe, G., Freshwater, D., Jasper, M. (2001) (eds.) ''Critical Reflection for Nursing and the Helping Professions''. Basingstoke, U.K: Palgrave. ISBN 0-333-77795-6. pp. 26 ''et seq.'', p. 35</ref>

==Application==
Reflective Practice has been described as an unstructured approach directing understanding and learning, a self regulated process, commonly used in health and teaching professions, though applicable to all professions.<ref>Boud D, Keogh R and Walker D (1985) ''Reflection, Turning Experience into Learning''. Routledge. ISBN 0-85038-864-3.</ref><ref name="Larrivee 2000">{{cite journal |last1=Larrivee |first1=Barbara |title=Transforming Teaching Practice: Becoming the critically reflective teacher |journal=Reflective Practice |volume=1 |pages=293 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/713693162 |issue=3}}</ref><ref>Schön D (1983) ''The Reflective Practitioner, How Professionals Think In Action'', Basic Books</ref> Reflective practice is a learning process taught to professionals from a variety of disciplines by practitioners, with the aim of enhancing abilities to communicate and making informed/balanced decisions. The practice has historically been applied most in the educational and medical field.When reflection in action and reflection on action described by Donald Schon are utilized in practice and when practitioners are able to identify these actions they become better at reflective practice. Professional Colleges such as the College of Nurses and College of Dental Hygienists are recognizing the importance of reflective practice and require practitioners to prepare reflective portfolios as a requirement to be licensed, and for yearly quality assurance purposes.

===Education===
In education, reflective practice refers to the process of the educator studying his or her own teaching methods and determining what works best for the students. It involves the consideration of the ethical consequences of classroom procedures on students.<ref name="Larrivee 2000" />

The appeal of the use of reflective practice for teachers is that as teaching and learning are complex, and there is not one right approach, reflecting on different versions of teaching, and reshaping past and current experiences will lead to improvement in teaching practices.<ref name="Leitch 2000">{{cite journal |last1=Leitch |first1=Ruth |last2=Day |first2=Christopher |title=Action research and reflective practice: towards a holistic view |journal=Educational Action Research |volume=8 |pages=179 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/09650790000200108}}</ref> Schön’s reflection-in-action assists teachers in making the professional knowledge that they will gain from their experience in the classroom an explicit part of their decision-making.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fien |first1=John |last2=Rawling |first2=Richard |title=Reflective Practice: A Case Study of Professional Development for Environmental Education |journal=The Journal of Environmental Education |volume=27 |pages=11 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9941462 |issue=3}}</ref>

As Larrivee argues, Reflective Practice moves teachers from their knowledge base of distinct skills to a stage in their careers where they are able to modify their skills to suit specific contexts and situations, and eventually to invent new strategies.<ref name="Larrivee 2000" /> In implementing a process of Reflective Practice teachers will be able to move themselves, and their schools, beyond existing theories in practice.<ref name="Leitch 2000" /> Larrivee concludes that teachers should “resist establishing a classroom culture of control and become a reflective practitioner, continuously engaging in a critical reflection, consequently remaining fluid in the dynamic environment of the classroom”.<ref name="Larrivee 2000" />

===Health professionals===
Reflective Practice is associated with learning from experience, and is viewed as an important strategy for health professionals who embrace lifelong learning. Due to the ever changing context of healthcare and the continual growth of medical knowledge, there is a high level of demand on healthcare professionals' expertise.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schäfer |first1=WD |title=Prostheses and epitheses in ophthalmology. What should a practitioner know |journal=Zeitschrift fur Allgemeinmedizin |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=118–21 |year=1971 |pmid=5566542}}</ref> Due to this complex and continually changing environment, healthcare professionals could benefit from a program of reflective practice.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0964-3397(96)81042-1 |last1=Hendricks |first1=J |last2=Mooney |first2=D |last3=Berry |first3=C |title=A practical strategy approach to use of reflective practice in critical care nursing |journal=Intensive & critical care nursing |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=97–101 |year=1996 |pmid=8845631}}</ref>

Price (2004<ref name="Price 2004">{{cite journal|last=Price|first=A|title=Encouraging reflection and critical thinking in practice|journal=Nursing Standard|date=4|year=2004|month=August|volume=18|issue=47}}</ref> ) recognizes that there are several reasons why a healthcare practitioner would engage in reflective practice: To further understand yourself, motives, perceptions, attitudes, values and feelings associated with client care; To provide a fresh outlook to practice situations and challenge existing thoughts, feelings as well as actions; To explore how the practice situation may be approached differently. 

In the field of nursing there is concern that actions may run the risk of habitualisation, thus dehumanising patients and their needs.<ref name="Walker1996">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0965-2302(96)90034-X |last1=Walker |first1=S |title=Reflective practice in the accident and emergency setting |journal=[[Accident and emergency nursing]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27–30 |year=1996 |pmid=8696852}}</ref> In utilising Reflective Practice, nurses are able to plan their actions and consciously monitor the action to ensure it is beneficial to their patient.<ref name="Walker1996" />

The act of reflection is seen as a way of promoting the development of autonomous, qualified and self-directed professionals. Engaging in Reflective Practice is associated with the improvement of the quality of care, stimulating personal and professional growth and closing the gap between theory and practice.<ref>Jasper, M. (2003) ''Beginning Reflective Practice (Foundations in Nursing and Health Care)''. Cheltenham: Nelson Thomas Ltd. ISBN 0-7487-7117-4. {{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>
Activities to promote reflection are now being incorporated into undergraduate, postgrduate and continuing medical education across a variety of health professions<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=Karen|coauthors=Gordon, MacLeod|title=Reflection and reflective Practice in health professions education: a systematic review|journal=Adv in Health Sci Educ|year=2009|volume=14|pages=595–621|doi=10.1007/s10459-007-9090-2}}</ref>  Mann (2009) found through her research that in practising professionals the process of reflection appears to be multifactorial and to include different aspects. In addition to reflection both on and during experiences that the anticipation of a challenging situation also stimulated reflection. Practicing professionals vary in their   tendency and ability to reflect. 

Davies (2012<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Samantha|title=Embracing reflective practice|journal=Education for Primary Care|year=2012|volume=23|pages=9–12}}</ref>) identifies that there are both benefits as well as limitations to reflective practice:

Benefits to Reflective Practice
*Increased learning from an experience for situation
*Promotion of deep learning
*Identification of personal and professional strengths and areas for improvement
*Identification of educational needs
*Acquisition of new knowledge and skills
*Further understanding of own beliefs, attitudes and values
*Encouragement of self-motivation and self-directed learning
*Could act as a source of feedback
*Possible improvements of personal and clinical confidence

Limitations of Reflective Practice
*Not all practitioners may understand the reflective process
*May feel uncomfortable challenging and evaluating own practice
*Could be time consuming
*May have confusion as to which situations/experiences to reflect upon
*May not be adequate to resolve clinical problems <ref name="Price 2004"/>

===Environmental management and sustainability===
There is some criticism that traditional [[environmental management]] which simply focuses on the problem at hand, fails to integrate the wider context in which the environment sits into the decision making.<ref name="Bryant 1998">{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=R.L. |last2=Wilson |first2=G.A. |title=Rethinking environmental management |journal=Progress in Human Geography |volume=22 |pages=321 |year=1998 |doi=10.1191/030913298672031592 |issue=3}}</ref>  While research and science must inform the process of environmental management, it is up to the practitioner to integrate those results within this wider context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fazey |first1=Ioan |last2=Fazey |first2=John A. |last3=Salisbury |first3=Janet G. |last4=Lindenmayer |first4=David B. |last5=Dovers |first5=Steve |title=The nature and role of experiential knowledge for environmental conservation |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=33 |pages=1 |year=2006 |doi=10.1017/S037689290600275X}}</ref> In order to deal with this and to reaffirm the utility of environmental management Bryant and Wilson propose that a “more reflective approach is required that seeks to rethink the basic premises of environmental management as a process”.<ref name="Bryant 1998" /> This style of approach has been found to be successful in [[sustainable development]] projects where participants appreciated and enjoyed the educational aspect of utilising reflective practice throughout, however the authors noted the challenges with melding the “circularity” of reflective practice theory with the “doing” of sustainability.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=S |last2=Morse |first2=S |title=Delivering sustainability therapy in sustainable development projects |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=37 |year=2005 |pmid=15748802 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.11.006}}</ref>

===Leadership Positions===
Reflective Practice provides a tremendous development opportunity for those in leadership positions. Managing a team of people requires a delicate balance between people skills and technical expertise, and success in this type of role does not come easily. Reflective Practice provides leaders with an opportunity to critically review what has been successful in the past and where improvement can be made. To support reflective learning organizations have invested in coaching programs for their emerging and established leaders.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Avolio|first=Bruce|coauthors=Avey, James, Quisenberry, David|title=Estimating Return on Leadership Development Investment|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|year=2010|volume=21|pages=633}}</ref> Coaching is defined by the International Coaching Federation as partnering with clients in a though provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Coach Federation|url=http://www.coachfederation.org/about-icf/overview/}}</ref> Leaders frequently engage in self-limiting behaviours because of their over reliance on their preferred ways of reacting and responding.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fisher Turesky|first=Elizabeth|coauthors=Gallagher, Dennis|title=Know Thyself: Coaching for Leadership using Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory|journal=The Coaching Psychologist|year=2011|month=June|volume=7|issue=1|pages=5}}</ref> To help support the establishment of new behaviours, coaching is extremely useful as it encourages reflection, critical thinking and transformative learning. Adults have acquired a body of experience throughout their life or frames of reference that define their world.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mezirow|first=Jack|title=Transformative Learning: Theory to Practice|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|date=Summer|year=1997|volume=74|pages=5}}</ref> Coaching programs support the process of questioning and potentially rebuilding these pre-determined frames of reference. The goal is for a leader to maximize their professional potential and in order to do this, there must be a process of critical reflection on current assumptions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mezirow|first=Jack|title=Transformative Learning: Theory to Practice|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|date=Summer|year=1997|volume=74|pages=7}}</ref>

===Other professions===
Reflective Practice can help an individual to develop personally, and is useful for professions other than those discussed above. It allows professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge and consider ways to interact with their colleagues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Somerville |first1=D |last2=Keeling |first2=J |title=A practical approach to promote reflective practice within nursing |journal=[[Nursing Times]] |volume=100 |issue=12 |pages=42–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15067912}}</ref>

Suggested ways for professionals to practice reflective management include:
*Coaching;
*Keeping a journal;
*Seeking feedback;
*View experiences objectively; and
*Taking time at the end of each day, meeting, experience etc. to reflect-on-actions.
*Anecdotal Notes
*Group discussion
