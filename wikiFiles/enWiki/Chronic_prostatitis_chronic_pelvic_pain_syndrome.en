'''Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis''' or '''chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome''' ('''CP/CPPS''') is a [[pelvic pain]] condition in men and women, and should be distinguished from other forms of [[prostatitis]] such as [[chronic bacterial prostatitis]] and [[Acute prostatitis|acute bacterial prostatitis]].<ref>{{cite pmid|12521576}}</ref> This condition was formerly known as '''prostatodynia''' (painful prostate).

==Signs and symptoms==
Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is characterised by pelvic or perineal [[pain]] without evidence of urinary tract infection,<ref name="pmid18164597">{{cite journal |author=Schaeffer AJ |title=Epidemiology and evaluation of chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men |journal=Int J Antimicrob Agents |volume= 31|issue= |year=2007 |pmid=18164597 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.08.027 | pages = 108}}</ref> lasting longer than 3 months,<ref name="pmid12195565">{{cite journal |author=Luzzi GA |title=Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain in men: aetiology, diagnosis and management |journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=253–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12195565 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-3083.2002.00481.x}}</ref> as the key symptom. Symptoms may wax and wane. Pain can range from mild discomfort to debilitating. Pain may radiate to back and rectum, making sitting difficult. [[Dysuria]], [[arthralgia]], [[myalgia]], unexplained [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], abdominal pain, constant burning pain in the penis, and frequency may all be present. Frequent urination and increased urgency may suggest [[interstitial cystitis]] (inflammation centred in bladder rather than prostate).

==Cause==

===Nerves, stress and hormones===
The symptoms of CP/CPPS appear to result from an interplay between psychological factors and dysfunction in the immune, neurological and endocrine systems.<ref name="pmid18405756">{{cite journal |author=Pontari MA, Ruggieri MR |title=Mechanisms in prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome |journal=J.

===Overlap with BPS/IC===
Some researchers have suggested that CPPS is a form of [[bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis]] (BPS/IC). In 2007 the [[NIDDK]] began to group IC/PBS and CP/CPPS under the umbrella term '''Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS)'''.

Many patients also experience pain as their bladders fill up which is also a typical sign of IC.

===Climate===
The ambient temperature appears to play a role as cold is frequently reported as causing symptom aggravation and heat is often reported to be ameliorating.<ref name="pmid17853027">{{cite journal |author=Hedelin H, Jonsson K |title=Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: symptoms are aggravated by cold and become less distressing with age and time |journal=Scand.

==Diagnosis==
There are no definitive diagnostic tests for CP/CPPS.

===Nomenclature===

A distinction is sometimes made between "IIIa" (Inflammatory) and "IIIb" (Noninflammatory) forms of CP/CPPS,<ref name="urlProstatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec17/ch240/ch240c.html |title=Prostatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> depending on whether pus cells (WBCs) can be found in the expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) of the patient. Some researchers have questioned the usefulness of this categorisation, calling for the Meares-Stamey four-glass test to be abandoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/494378 |title=Treatment of Chronic Prostatitis |publisher=www.medscape.com|accessdate=2010-04-18 }}</ref>

In 2007, the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] (NIDDK) began using the [[umbrella term]] '''Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes''' ([[UCPPS]]), for research purposes, to refer to pain syndromes associated with the bladder (i.e. [[interstitial cystitis|interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, IC/PBS]]) and the prostate gland (i.e. chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, CP/CPPS).<ref name="NIDDK UCPPS">{{Cite web|url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DK-07-003.html|title=Multi-disciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network|accessdate=2008-01-11|publisher=NIDDK|year=2007}}</ref>

Older terms for this condition are "prostatodynia" (prostate pain) and non-bacterial chronic prostatitis.

===Pharmacological===
A number of medications can be used to treat this disorder. [[Alpha blockers]] and/or antibiotics appear to be the most effective with [[NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]] providing lesser benefit.<ref name=Review11>{{cite journal|last=Anothaisintawee|first=T|coauthors=Attia, J, Nickel, JC, Thammakraisorn, S, Numthavaj, P, McEvoy, M, Thakkinstian, A|title=Management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2011 Jan 5|volume=305|issue=1|pages=78–86|pmid=21205969|doi=10.1001/jama.2010.1913}}</ref>

===Alternative===
* The [[Broccoli]]therapy has been developed and researched for more than 10 years by Prof. [[Ibrahim Adnan Saracoglu]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. In this treatment a certain quantity of broccoli gets cooked in the morning. The decoction is used like a tea. After continuous usage for several months the patients had severally smaller prostata deposits and the inflammation level reduced.

* [[Acetylcysteine]] is a [[mucolytic agent]] and has been researched for a few years regarding Prostatitis. Mucolytic proteins are the main content of prostate secretion. In case of prostate inflammation a one time dosage of 1200mg Acetylcysteine reduces the cellular inside pressure of the prostate. This can be repeated in case of relapsing prostatitis syndroms.
