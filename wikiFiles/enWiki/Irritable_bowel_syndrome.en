'''Irritable  bowel syndrome''' ('''IBS''', or '''spastic colon''') is a symptom-based diagnosis characterized by chronic [[abdominal pain]], discomfort, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits. As a [[functional bowel disorder]], IBS has no known organic cause.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|misc/v20113721|irritable bowel syndrome}}</ref>  [[Diarrhea]] or [[constipation]] may predominate, or they may alternate (classified as '''IBS-D''', '''IBS-C''' or '''IBS-A''', respectively).  Historically a [[diagnosis of exclusion]], a diagnosis of IBS can now be made on the basis of symptoms alone, in the absence of alarm features such as age of onset greater than 50 years, weight loss, gross [[hematochezia]], systemic signs of infection or colitis, or family history of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].<ref name="Malagelada">{{cite journal |pmid=16409429 |year=2006 |last1=Malagelada |first1=JR |title=A symptom-based approach to making a positive diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 |doi=10.1111/j.1368-5031.2005.00744.x |journal=International journal of clinical practice}}</ref><ref name="Cash">{{cite journal |pmid=12425553 |year=2002 |last1=Cash |first1=BD |last2=Schoenfeld |first2=P |last3=Chey |first3=WD |title=The utility of diagnostic tests in irritable bowel syndrome patients: A systematic review |volume=97 |issue=11 |pages=2812–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2002.07027.x |journal=The American journal of gastroenterology}}</ref> Onset of IBS is more likely to occur after an infection (post-infectious, '''IBS-PI'''),{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} a [[Stress (medicine)|stressful]] life event,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} or onset of maturity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Although there is no cure for IBS, there are treatments that attempt to relieve symptoms, including dietary adjustments, medication and [[psychotherapy|psychological interventions]].

Several conditions may present as IBS, including [[coeliac disease]], [[fructose malabsorption]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/305.pdf |title=Fruktosemalabsorption |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-21}}</ref> mild infections, [[parasitic]] infections like [[giardiasis]],<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3225/is_n8_v53/ai_18408730 Intestinal Infection]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> several [[inflammatory bowel disease]]s, [[bile acid malabsorption]], [[Functional constipation|functional chronic constipation]], [[small intestinal bacterial overgrowth]], and [[chronic functional abdominal pain]]. In IBS, routine clinical tests yield no abnormalities, although the bowels may be more sensitive to certain stimuli, such as balloon insufflation testing. The exact cause of IBS is [[Idiopathic|unknown]]. The most common theory is that IBS is a disorder of the interaction between the brain and the [[gastrointestinal tract]], although there may also be abnormalities in the [[gut flora]] or the [[immune system]].<ref name="Yang and Li-2008">{{cite journal |author=Yang CM, Li YQ |title=[The therapeutic effects of eliminating allergic foods according to food-specific IgG antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=641–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17967233 |url=}}</ref><ref name=Stark7>{{cite journal |author=Stark D, van Hal S, Marriott D, Ellis J, Harkness J |title=Irritable bowel syndrome: a review on the role of intestinal protozoa and the importance of their detection and diagnosis |journal=Int.

==Classification==
IBS can be classified as either [[diarrhea]]-predominant (IBS-D), [[constipation]]-predominant (IBS-C), or with alternating stool pattern (IBS-A or pain-predominant<ref name="pmid12776965">{{cite journal |author=Holten KB, Wetherington A, Bankston L |title=Diagnosing the patient with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits: is it irritable bowel syndrome? |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=67 |issue=10 |pages=2157–62 |year=2003 |pmid=12776965 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030515/2157.html}}</ref>). In some individuals, IBS may have an acute onset and develop after an [[infection|infectious]] illness characterized by two or more of the following: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or positive [[stool culture]]. This post-infective syndrome has consequently been termed "post-infectious IBS" (IBS-PI).

==Signs and symptoms==
The primary symptoms of IBS are [[abdominal pain]] or discomfort in association with frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits.<ref name="SCHMULSON_1999">{{cite journal |author=Schmulson MW, Chang L |title=Diagnostic approach to the patient with irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Am.

==Causes==
The cause of IBS is unknown; several hypotheses have been proposed. The risk of developing IBS increases sixfold after acute gastrointestinal infection.

==Diagnosis==
There is no specific laboratory or imaging test that can be performed to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis of IBS involves excluding conditions that produce IBS-like symptoms and then following a procedure to categorize the patient's symptoms. Ruling out parasitic infections, lactose intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and celiac disease is recommended for all patients before a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is made. In patients over 50 years old, it is recommended that they undergo a screening colonoscopy.<ref name="YAWN_2001">{{cite journal |author=Yawn BP, Lydick E, Locke GR, Wollan PC, Bertram SL, Kurland MJ |title=Do published guidelines for evaluation of Irritable Bowel Syndrome reflect practice? |journal=BMC gastroenterology |volume=1|page=11 |year=2001 |pmid=11701092|doi=10.1186/1471-230X-1-11 |pmc=59674}}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
[[Colon cancer]], inflammatory bowel disease, [[thyroid]] disorders, and giardiasis can all feature abnormal defecation and abdominal pain. Less common causes of this symptom profile are [[carcinoid syndrome]], [[microscopic colitis]], [[bacterial overgrowth]], and [[eosinophilic gastroenteritis]]; IBS is, however, such a common presentation, and testing for these conditions would yield such low numbers of positive results, that it is considered difficult to justify the expense.<ref name="Hauser2005">{{cite book|author=C. Hauser|title=Mayo Clinic Gastroenterology and Hepatology Board Review|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nStxzRQlNaAC&pg=PA225|accessdate=October 24, 2010|date=August 29, 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-50274-7|page=225–}}</ref>
Because there are many causes of [[diarrhea]] that give IBS-like symptoms, the [[American Gastroenterological Association]] published a set of guidelines for tests to be performed to rule out other causes for these symptoms. These include gastrointestinal infections, [[lactose intolerance]], and [[coeliac disease]]. Research has suggested that these guidelines are not always followed.<ref name="YAWN_2001" /> Once other causes have been excluded, the diagnosis of IBS is performed using a diagnostic [[algorithm]]. Well-known algorithms include the [[Manning Criteria]], the obsolete [[Rome Process|Rome I and II criteria]], and the Kruis Criteria, and studies have compared their reliability.<ref name="FASS_2001">{{cite journal |author=Fass R |title=Evidence- and consensus-based practice guidelines for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=161 |issue=17 |pages=2081–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11570936|doi=10.1001/archinte.161.17.2081 |author-separator=, |author2=Longstreth GF |author3=Pimentel M |display-authors=3 |last4=Fullerton |first4=S |last5=Russak |first5=SM |last6=Chiou |first6=CF |last7=Reyes |first7=E |last8=Crane |first8=P |last9=Eisen |first9=G}}</ref> The more recent [[Rome Process|Rome III Process]] was published in 2006. Physicians may choose to use one of these guidelines or may simply choose to rely on their own anecdotal experience with past patients. The algorithm may include additional tests to guard against misdiagnosis of other diseases as IBS.  Such "red flag" symptoms may include weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, or nocturnal symptoms. However, researchers have noted that red flag conditions may not always contribute to accuracy in diagnosis; for instance, as many as 31% of IBS patients have blood in their stool, many possibly from hemorrhoidal bleeding.<ref name="FASS_2001" />

The diagnostic algorithm identifies a name that can be applied to the patient's condition based on the combination of the patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. For example, the statement "50% of returning travelers had developed functional diarrhea while 25% had developed IBS" would mean that half the travelers had diarrhea while a quarter had diarrhea with abdominal pain. While some researchers believe this categorization system will help physicians understand IBS, others have questioned the value of the system and suggested that all IBS patients have the same underlying disease but with different symptoms.<ref name="TALLEY_2006">{{cite journal |author=Talley NJ |title=A unifying hypothesis for the functional gastrointestinal disorders: really multiple diseases or one irritable gut? |journal=Reviews in gastroenterological disorders |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=72–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16699476 }}</ref>

===Investigations===
Investigations are performed to exclude other conditions:
* Stool microscopy and culture (to exclude infectious conditions)
* Blood tests: [[Full blood examination]], [[Liver function tests]], [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], serological testing for coeliac disease
* Abdominal [[ultrasound]] (to exclude [[gallstone]]s and other biliary tract diseases)
* [[Endoscopy]] and biopsies (to exclude peptic ulcer disease, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancies)
* [[Hydrogen breath test]]ing (to exclude fructose and lactose malabsorption)

===Misdiagnosis===
Published research has demonstrated that some poor patient outcomes are due to treatable causes of diarrhea being misdiagnosed as IBS.

===Comorbidities===
Researchers have identified several medical conditions, or [[comorbidities]], which appear with greater frequency in patients diagnosed with IBS.

==Management==
A number of treatments have been found to be better than placebo, including fiber, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ford AC |title=Effect of fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |pages=a2313 |year=2008 |pmid=19008265 |pmc=2583392 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.a2313|url= |author-separator=, |author2=Talley NJ |author3=Spiegel BM |display-authors=3 |last4=Foxx-Orenstein |first4=A.

===Diet===
Some people with IBS may have food intolerances.

A low [[FODMAP]] diet has been shown to reduce symptoms in functional GI disorders such as IBS by 60-80%.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Peter R Gibson and Susan J Shepherd| title=Evidence-based dietary management of functional gastrointestinal symptoms: The FODMAP approach | journal=Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology | year=2010 | pages=252–258| volume=25 | issue=10 | pmid=20136989 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1746.2009.06149.x }}<!--No PMC number exists--></ref> This diet restricts various carbohydrates which are poorly absorbed in the [[small intestine]], as well as [[fructose]] and [[lactose]], which are similarly poorly absorbed in those with intolerances to them. Reduction of fructose and [[fructan]] have been shown to reduce IBS symptoms in a dose-dependent manner in patients with [[fructose malabsorption]] and IBS.<ref>[http://www.gastro.org/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5549 American Gastroenterological Association]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Many individuals with IBS are [[lactose intolerance|lactose intolerant]] and a trial of a lactose-free diet is often recommended.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Böhmer CJ, Tuynman HA |title=The effect of a lactose-restricted diet in patients with a positive lactose tolerance test, earlier diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study |journal=Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=941–4 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11507359 |doi= 10.1097/00042737-200108000-00011}}</ref> Alternatively, an over-the-counter remedy containing lactase enzyme can be taken before consuming milk products. Allergy to milk products also causes diarrhea and other symptoms, and this will not be improved by a lactase enzyme supplement. Many who benefit from a low FODMAP diet need not restrict fructose or lactose.

Some IBS patients believe they have some form of dietary intolerance; however, tests attempting to predict food sensitivity in IBS have been disappointing. A small study reported that an IgG antibody test was somewhat effective in determining food sensitivity in IBS patients, with patients on the elimination diet experiencing 10% greater symptom reduction than those on a sham diet.<ref name="Gut2004-Atkinson">{{cite journal | author=Atkinson W, Sheldon TA, Shaath N, Whorwell PJ | title=Food elimination based on IgG antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome: a randomised controlled trial | journal=Gut | year=2004 | pages=1459–64 | volume=53 | issue=10 | pmid=15361495 | doi=10.1136/gut.2003.037697 | pmc=1774223}}</ref> However, more research is necessary before IgG testing can be recommended.<ref name="Longstreth2006">{{cite journal | author=Longstreth GF, Thompson WG, Chey WD, Houghton LA, Mearin F, Spiller RC | title=Functional bowel disorders | journal=Gastroenterology | year=2006 | page=688 | volume=131 | issue=2 | pmid= | doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2006.06.027 | pmc= }}</ref>

There is no evidence that digestion of food or absorption of nutrients is problematic for those with IBS at rates different from those without IBS. However, the very act of eating or drinking can provoke an overreaction of the [[gastrocolic response]] in some patients with IBS owing to their heightened visceral sensitivity, and this may lead to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or constipation.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sjölund K, Ekman R, Lindgren S, Rehfeld J | title = Disturbed motilin and cholecystokinin release in the irritable bowel syndrome | journal=Scand J Gastroenterol | volume = 31 | issue = 11 | pages = 1110–4 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8938905 | doi = 10.3109/00365529609036895}}</ref>

====Fiber====
There is some evidence that soluble [[dietary fibre|fiber]] supplementation (e.g., [[Psyllium seed husks|psyllium/ispagula husk]]) is effective in the general IBS population. It acts as a bulking agent, and for many IBS-D patients, it allows for a more consistent stool. For IBS-C patients, it seems to allow for a softer, moister, more easily passable stool.

On the contrary, insoluble fiber (e.g., [[bran]]) has not been found to be effective for IBS.<ref name="Shen-2009"/> In some people, insoluble fiber supplementation may aggravate symptoms.<ref name="Ducrotté-2007">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ducrotté | first1 = P. | title = [Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options] | journal=Presse Med | volume = 36 | issue = 11 Pt 2 | pages = 1619–26 | month = Nov | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.lpm.2007.03.008 | pmid = 17490849 }}</ref>

Fiber might be beneficial in those who have a predominance of constipation. In patients who have IBS-C, soluble fiber at doses of 20&nbsp;grams per day can reduce overall symptoms but will not reduce pain. The research supporting [[dietary fiber]] contains conflicting, small studies that are complicated by the heterogeneity of types of fiber and doses used.<ref name=pmid14984370>{{cite journal | author=Bijkerk C, Muris J, Knottnerus J, Hoes A, de Wit N | title = Systematic review: the role of different types of fiber in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome | journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 245–51 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14984370 | doi = 10.1111/j.0269-2813.2004.01862.x}}</ref>

===Medication===
Medications may consist of stool softeners and [[laxative]]s in constipation-predominant IBS and antidiarrheals (e.g., [[opiate]], [[opioid]], or opioid [[analog (chemistry)|analog]]s such as [[loperamide]], [[codeine]], [[diphenoxylate]]) in diarrhea-predominant IBS for mild symptoms and stronger opiates such as [[morphine]] and [[oxycodone]] for severe cases.<ref name=pmid21833945>{{cite journal |author=Ruepert L, Quartero AO, de Wit NJ, van der Heijden GJ, Rubin G, Muris JW |title=Bulking agents, antispasmodics and antidepressants for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=8 |pages=CD003460 |year=2011 |pmid=21833945 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003460.pub3}}</ref><ref name=pmid15606387>{{cite journal | author=Lesbros-Pantoflickova D, Michetti P, Fried M, Beglinger C, Blum A | title = Meta-analysis: The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome | journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther | volume = 20 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 1253–69 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15606387 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02267.x}}</ref><ref name=pmid10896640>{{cite journal | author=Jailwala J, Imperiale T, Kroenke K | title = Pharmacologic treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials | journal=Ann Intern Med | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–47 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10896640}}</ref>

Drugs affecting [[serotonin]] (5-HT) in the intestines can help reduce symptoms.<ref name=pmid11755632>{{cite journal | author=Talley N | title = Serotoninergic neuroenteric modulators | journal=Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9298 | pages = 2061–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11755632 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07103-3}}</ref> 5HT3 antagonists such as [[ondansetron]] are effective in postinfectious IBS and diarrhoea-dominant IBS due to their blockade of serotonin on 5HT3 receptors in the gut; the reason for their benefit is believed to be that excessive serotonin in the gut is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of some subtypes of IBS. Benefits may include reduced diarrhoea, reduced abdominal cramps, and improved general well-being.

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, SSRIs, frequently prescribed for panic and/or anxiety disorder and depression, affect serotonin in the gut as well as the brain. The bowels are highly dependent on serotonin for neural communication. "Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressants seem to promote global well-being in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome and, possibly, some improvement in abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, but this effect appears to be independent of improved depression. Further research is required."<ref>{{cite pmid|16849340}}</ref>

;Laxatives

For patients who do not adequately respond to [[dietary fiber]], osmotic [[laxatives]] such as [[polyethylene glycol]], [[sorbitol]], and [[lactulose]] can help avoid "[[cathartic colon]]" which has been associated with stimulant laxatives.<ref name=pmid9649012>{{cite journal | author=Joo J, Ehrenpreis E, Gonzalez L, Kaye M, Breno S, Wexner S, Zaitman D, Secrest K | title = Alterations in colonic anatomy induced by chronic stimulant laxatives: the cathartic colon revisited | journal=J Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–6 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9649012 | doi = 10.1097/00004836-199806000-00014}}</ref>  Among the osmotic laxatives, 17–26&nbsp;grams/day of [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) has been well studied.

[[Lubiprostone]] (Amitiza), is a gastrointestinal agent used for the treatment of [[idiopathic]] [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[constipation]] and constipation-predominant IBS. It is well tolerated in adults, including elderly patients. As of July 20, 2006, Lubiprostone had not been studied in pediatric patients. Lubiprostone is a bicyclic [[fatty acid]] ([[prostaglandin]] E1 derivative) that acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements (SBM). Unlike many laxative products, Lubiprostone does not show signs of tolerance, dependency, or altered serum [[electrolyte]] concentration.

;Antispasmodics

The use of [[antispasmodic]] drugs (e.g., [[anticholinergic]]s such as [[hyoscyamine]] or [[dicyclomine]]) may help patients, especially those with cramps or diarrhea. A [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concludes that if seven patients are treated with antispasmodics, one patient will benefit.<ref name=pmid21833945/> Antispasmodics can be divided in two groups: neurotropics and musculotropics.
* Neurotropics — for example, [[phenobarbital]]s such as [[Donnatal]] or [[atropine]] — act at the nerve fibre of the parasympathicus but also affect other nerves, causing side effects in many patients.
* Musculotropics such as [[mebeverine]] act directly at the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, relieving spasm without affecting normal gut motility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Since this action is not mediated by the autonomic nervous system, the usual anticholinergic side effects are absent.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

;Tricyclic antidepressants
There is strong evidence that low doses of [[tricyclic antidepressants]] can be effective for irritable bowel syndrome. However, there is less robust evidence as to the effectiveness of other antidepressant classes such as [[SSRIs]].<ref name="Shen-2009"/><ref name="Ducrotté-2007"/>

;Serotonin agonists
* [[Tegaserod]] (Zelnorm), a selective 5-HT4 agonist for IBS-C, is available for relieving IBS constipation in women and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[idiopathic]] [[constipation]] in men and women. On March 30, 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested that Novartis Pharmaceuticals voluntarily discontinue marketing of tegaserod based on the recently identified finding of an increased risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events (heart problems) associated with use of the drug. Novartis agreed to voluntarily suspend marketing of the drug in the United States and in many other countries. On July 27, 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a limited-treatment IND program for tegaserod in the USA to allow restricted access to the medication for patients in need if no comparable alternative drug or therapy is available to treat the disease. The FDA had issued two previous warnings about the serious consequences of tegaserod. In 2005, tegaserod was rejected as an IBS medication by the European Union. Tegaserod, marketed as Zelnorm in the United States, was the only agent approved to treat the multiple symptoms of IBS (in women only), including constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating.

Domperidone, a dopamine receptor blocker and a parasympathomimetic, has been shown to reduce bloating and abdominal pain as a result of an accelerated colon transit time and reduced faecal load, that is, a relief from ''hidden constipation''; defecation was similarly improved.<ref>Raahave D, Christensen E, Loud FB, Knudsen LL.

===Psychotherapy===
The mind-body or brain-gut interactions has been proposed for irritable bowel syndrome and is gaining increasing research attention.<ref name="Shen-2009"/> For some patients, psychological therapies may help with symptoms. [[Cognitive behavioural therapy]] and [[hypnosis]] have been found to be the most beneficial.

A questionnaire in 2006 designed to identify patients’ perceptions about IBS, their preferences on the type of information they need, and educational media and expectations from health care providers revealed misperceptions about IBS developing into other conditions, including [[colitis]], [[malnutrition]], and cancer.<ref name="JClinGastro2006-Halpert">{{cite journal | author=Halpert AD, Thomas AC, Hu Y, Morris CB, Bangdiwala SI, Drossman DA | title=A survey on patient educational needs in irritable bowel syndrome and attitudes toward participation in clinical research | journal=J Clin Gastroenterol | year=2006 | pages=37–43 | volume=40 | issue=1 | pmid=16340632 | doi=10.1097/01.mcg.0000190759.95862.08}}</ref>

The survey found IBS patients were most interested in learning about foods to avoid (60%), causes of IBS (55%), medications (58%), coping strategies (56%), and psychological factors related to IBS (55%). The respondents indicated that they wanted their physicians to be available via phone or e-mail following a visit (80%), have the ability to listen (80%), and provide hope (73%) and support (63%).

===Stress relief===
Reducing stress may reduce the frequency and severity of IBS symptoms. Techniques that may be helpful include:

*Relaxation techniques such as [[meditation]]
*Physical activities such as [[yoga]] or [[tai chi]]
*Regular exercise such as swimming, walking or running<ref name="nhs_choices">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Irritable-bowel-syndrome/Pages/Treatment.aspx |title=Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - Treatment - NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-21}}</ref>

===Exercise===
Many patients find that exercise helps with IBS. At least 30 minutes of strenuous exercise 5 times a week is recommended.<ref name="nhs_choices"/>

===Alternative medicine===
Because of often unsatisfactory results from medical treatments for IBS, up to 50 percent of people turn to complementary [[alternative medicine]].<ref name="Shen-2009"/>

==History==
One of the first references to the concept of an "irritable bowel" appeared in the ''Rocky Mountain Medical Journal'' in 1950.<ref name="BROWN_1950">{{cite journal |author=Brown PW |title=The irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Rocky Mountain Medical Journal |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=343–6 |year=1950 |pmid=15418074 }}</ref>  The term was used to categorize patients who developed symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, but where no well-recognized infective cause could be found.  Early theories suggested that the irritable bowel was caused by a psychosomatic or mental disorder.

==Research==
Gibson and Shepherd state a diet restricted in fermentable [[Oligosaccharide|oligo-]] [[Disaccharide|di-]] and [[Monosaccharides|mono-saccharides]] and [[polyol]]s ([[FODMAP]]s) now has an evidence base sufficiently strong to recommend its widespread application in conditions such as IBS and [[Inflammatory bowel disease|IBD]].<ref>

It is more successful than restricting only fructose and fructans, which are also FODMAPs, as is recommended for those with [[fructose malabsorption]]. Longer term compliance with the diet was high.

A randomised controlled trial on IBS patients found relaxing an IgG-mediated food intolerance diet led to a 24% greater deterioration in symptoms compared to those on the elimination diet and concluded food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.<ref name="Gut2004-Atkinson" />
