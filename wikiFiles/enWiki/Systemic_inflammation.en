Chronic '''systemic inflammation''' (SI) is the result of release of [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]]s from immune-related cells and the chronic activation of the innate immune system.

It can contribute to the development or progression of certain conditions.<ref name="pmid14676136">{{Cite journal|author=Sattar N, McCarey DW, Capell H, McInnes IB |title=Explaining how "high-grade" systemic inflammation accelerates vascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Circulation |volume=108 |issue=24 |pages=2957â€“63 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14676136 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000099844.31524.05 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14676136}}</ref>

==Mechanisms Inducing SI==
Release of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s and activation of the innate immune system may be the result of either external (biological or chemical agents) or internal (genetic mutations/variations) factors.

==Lack of Control by Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells and T-regulatory Cells==
While SI may be induced by multiple external factors, research suggests that a lack of control by tolerogenic [[dendritic cell]]s and [[T-regulatory cell]]s (Treg) is possibly the primary risk factor for the development of SI.  In functioning immune responses, T-helper and T-cytotoxic cells are activated by presentation of antigens by [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs).  Chief among these are [[dendritic cell]]s (DCs).  When a DC presents an antigen to a Treg cell, a signal is then sent to the nucleus of the DC, resulting in the production of [[Indoleamine 2,3- Dioxygenase]] (IDO). IDO inhibits T cell responses by depleting [[tryptophan]] and producing [[kynurenine]], which is toxic to the cell.

Individuals susceptible to developing chronic systemic inflammation appear to lack proper functioning of Treg cells and TDCs.  In these individuals, a lack of control of inflammatory processes results in multiple chemical and food intolerances, autoimmune diseases and many other symptoms and diseases.
