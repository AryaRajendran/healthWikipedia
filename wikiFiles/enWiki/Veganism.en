'''Veganism''' ([[WP:IPA for English|{{IPA|/ˈviːgənɪzəm/}}]]) is the practice of abstaining from the use of [[animal product]]s, particularly in diet, as well as an associated philosophy that rejects the [[commodity]] status of [[sentiocentrism|sentient]] animals. A follower of veganism is known as a '''vegan'''.

Distinctions are sometimes made between different categories of veganism. '''Dietary vegans''' (or strict [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]]) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat and fish but, in contrast to [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|ovo-lacto vegetarian]]s, also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances, such as [[honey]]. The term '''ethical vegan''' is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet, but extend the vegan philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals or animal products for any purpose.<ref name=ethicaldietary>For the ethical/dietary distinction, see for example:
*[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/05/health/main7216497.shtml "Vegan Diets Become More Popular, More Mainstream"], Associated Press/CBS News, 5 January 2011: "Ethical vegans have a moral aversion to harming animals for human consumption ... though the term often is used to describe people who follow the diet, not the larger philosophy."
*[[Gary Francione|Francione, Gary]] and [[Robert Garner|Garner, Robert]]. ''The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?'' Columbia University Press, 2010 (hereafter Francione and Garner 2010), [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&pg=PA62 p. 62]: "Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals ..."
*[http://books.google.com/books?id=aQgAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50 "Veganism"], ''[[Vegetarian Times]]'', January 1989: "Webster's dictionary provides a most dry and limiting definition of the word 'vegan': 'one that consumes no animal food or dairy products.' This description explains dietary veganism, but so-called ethical vegans – and they are the majority – carry the philosophy further."</ref> Another term used is [[environmental vegetarianism|environmental veganism]], which refers to the rejection of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and [[sustainability|unsustainable]].<ref name=environmental>Cole, Matthew.

The term ''vegan'' was coined in England in 1944 by [[Donald Watson]], co-founder of the British [[Vegan Society]], to mean "non-dairy vegetarian"; the society also opposed the consumption of eggs. In 1951 the society extended the definition of ''veganism'' to mean "the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals," and in 1960 [[H. Jay Dinshah]] started the [[American Vegan Society]], linking veganism to the [[Jainism|Jain]] concept of [[ahimsa]], the avoidance of violence against living things.<ref name=Berry>Berry, Ryan. "Veganism," ''The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink''. Oxford University Press, 2007, [http://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&pg=PA604 pp. 604–605].
* For the origins of the term "vegan," see [http://www.vegparadise.com/24carrot610.html "Interview with Donald Watson"], ''Vegetarians in Paradise'', 11 August 2004: "I invited my early readers to suggest a more concise word to replace "non-dairy vegetarian." Some bizarre suggestions were made like "dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivore, beaumangeur", et cetera. I settled for my own word, "vegan", containing the first three and last two letters of "vegetarian" – "the beginning and end of vegetarian." The word was accepted by the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' and no one has tried to improve it."
*Watson, Donald. [http://ukveggie.com/vegan_news/vegan_news_1.pdf ''Vegan News''], No. 1, November 1944: "We should all consider carefully what our Group, and our magazine, and ourselves, shall be called. 'Non-dairy' has become established as a generally understood colloquialism, but like 'non-lacto' it is too negative. Moreover, it does not imply that we are opposed to the use of eggs as food."

Veganism is a small but growing movement. In many countries the number of vegan restaurants is increasing, and some of the top athletes in certain endurance sports – for instance, the [[Ironman triathlon]] and the [[ultramarathon]] – practise veganism, including [[raw veganism]].<ref>Berry 2007, [http://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&pg=PA604 pp. 604–605]:
* "Despite the seeming hardships a vegan diet imposes on its practitioners, veganism is a burgeoning movement, especially among younger Americans. In the endurance sports, such as the Ironman triathlon and the Utramarathon, the top competitors are vegans who consume much of their vegan food in its uncooked state. Even young weight lifters and body builders are gravitating to a vegan diet, giving the lie to the notion that eating animal flesh is essential for strength and stamina. [[Brendan Brazier]], a young athlete who regularly places in the top three in international triathlon events and who formulated Vega, a line of plant-based performance products, said of his fellow vegan athletes: 'We're beginning to build a strong presence in every sport.'"

===Coining the term ''vegetarianism'' (19th century)===
{{further|History of vegetarianism}}
[[File:Fruitlands in 1915.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=photograph|[[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]] in 1915, an early vegan community in Harvard, Massachusetts]]
Vegetarianism can be traced to Ancient [[Ancient India|India]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], but the word ''vegetarian'' came into use in English in the early 19th century to refer to those who avoided meat; ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' attributes the earliest known use of the word to the English actress [[Fanny Kemble]] (1809–1893), writing in Georgia in the United States in 1839.<ref name=Kemble>Kemble, Fanny. ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839''. Harper and Brothers, New York, 1839, [http://books.google.com/books?id=WaFiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA197 pp. 197–198]: "The sight and smell of raw meat are especially odious to me, and I have often thought that if I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian, probably, indeed, return entirely to my green and salad days."
*Also see Davis, John. [http://www.ivu.org/history/kemble.html "The earliest known uses of the word 'vegetarian'"], and [http://www.ivu.org/history/vegetarian.html "Extracts from some journals 1842–48 – the earliest known uses of the word 'vegetarian'"], International Vegetarian Union, accessed 17 December 2012.
*Another early use of "vegetarian" is the April 1842 edition of ''The Healthian'', a journal published by [[Alcott House]]: "Tell a healthy vegetarian that his diet is very uncongenial to the wants of his nature." See Preece, Rod. ''Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought''.

*Preece 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=uMnubkF5HjACpg=PA12 pp. 12–13].</ref> The British [[Vegetarian Society]] defines ''vegetarian'' as "someone who lives on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits with, or without, the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or [[Rendering (animals)|by-products of slaughter]]."<ref>[http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=698 "What is a vegetarian?"], Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 December 2012.</ref>

In the 19th century vegetarians who also avoided eggs and dairy products, or avoided using animals for any purpose, were referred to as strict or total vegetarians.<ref>For a 19th-century reference to the vegetarian/strict vegetarian division, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=gwQFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA237 "Under Examination"], ''The Dietetic Reformer and Vegetarian Messenger'', Vol XI, 1884, p. 237: "There are two kinds of Vegetarians – an extreme sect, who eat no animal food whatever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish ... The Vegetarian Society ... belongs to the more moderate division."</ref> There were several attempts in the 19th century to establish strict-vegetarian communities. In 1834 [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (1799–1888), the American [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] and father of the novelist [[Louisa May Alcott]] (1832–1888) – opened the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] in Boston, Massachusetts, along strict-vegetarian principles, and in England in 1838 [[James Pierrepont Greaves]] (1777–1842) opened [[Alcott House]] in Ham, Surrey, a community and school that followed a strict-vegetarian diet.<ref>For the Temple School, see Iacobbo, Karen and Iacobbo, Michael.

*Others involved in founding the society included the ovo-lacto vegetarian [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] and readers of the ''Truth-Tester'' temperance journal. The society held its first meeting, chaired by Salford MP [[Joseph Brotherton]] (1783–1857), in September 1847 at Northwood Villa in Ramsgate, Kent. See Davis, John.

*Also see [http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=827 "History of the Vegetarian Society"], Vegetarian Society, accessed 7 February 2011.</ref> In 1851 an article appeared in the society's magazine about alternatives to leather for shoes, which the [[International Vegetarian Union]] cites as evidence of the existence in England of a group who were not only strict vegetarians, but avoided animal products entirely.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080630114643/http://www.ivu.org/history/renaissance/words.html "History of Vegetarianism: The Origin of Some Words"], International Vegetarian Union, 6 April 2010: "... as early as 1851 there was an article in the Vegetarian Society magazine (copies still exist) about alternatives to leather for making shoes, there was even a report of someone patenting a new material. So there was always another group who were not just 'strict vegetarians' but also avoided using animal products for clothing or other purposes – naturally they wanted their own 'word' too, but they had a long wait."</ref> In 1886 the society published an influential essay, ''A Plea for Vegetarianism'', by the English campaigner [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt]] (1851–1939), a classics teacher at Eton. Salt promoted vegetarianism as a moral issue, not only as an issue of human health; in his ''Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress'' (1892), he was one of the first writers to make the paradigm shift from [[animal welfare]] to [[animal rights]].<ref>For Salt being the first modern animal rights advocate, see [[Angus Taylor|Taylor, Angus]].

In 1910 the first known British vegan cookbook, ''No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes'' by Rupert H. Wheldon, was published in London by C.W. Daniel.<ref>Leneman, Leah.

:*In the book, Wheldon argued that "it is obvious that, since we should live as to give the greatest possible happiness to all beings capable of appreciating it and as it is an indisputable fact that animals can suffer pain, ''and that men who slaughter animals needlessly suffer from atrophy of all finer feelings'', we should therefore cause no unnecessary suffering in the animal world."

One reader wrote: "You cannot have eggs without also having on your hands a number of male birds, which you must kill."<ref>[http://ethik.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/inst_ethik_wiss_dialog/Leneman__L._1999._No_Animal_Food__The_Road_to_Veganism_in_Britain__1909-1944..pdf Leneman 1999], pp. 219–220, 222.
*C.P. Newcombe, the editor of ''TVMHR'', the journal of the society's Manchester branch, started a debate about it in 1912 on the letters page, to which 24 vegetarians responded. He summarized their views: "The defence of the use of eggs and milk by vegetarians, so far as it has been offered here, is not satisfactory. The only true way is to live on cereals, pulse, fruit, nuts and vegetables."</ref> The Vegetarian Society's position remained unresolved, but its journal wrote in 1923 that the "ideal position for vegetarians is abstinence from animal products."<ref name="Leneman1999p221"/>

In November 1931 Mahatma Gandhi addressed a meeting in London of the Vegetarian Society – attended by around 500 members, including Henry Salt – arguing that it ought to promote a meat-free diet as a moral issue, not as an issue of human health.<ref>[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi, Mahatma]].

[[File:Donald watson.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|220px|[[Donald Watson]] coined the term ''vegan'', and co-founded the British [[Vegan Society]] in 1944.]]
In August 1944 two of the Vegetarian Society's members, [[Donald Watson]] (1910–2005) and Elsie "Sally" Shrigley (died 1978), suggested forming a subgroup of non-dairy vegetarians. When the executive committee rejected the idea, they and five others met on 1 November that year at the Attic Club in Holborn, London, to discuss setting up a separate organization.<ref>Stepaniak 2000(a), [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&pg=PA1 pp. 1–2].</ref> They suggested several terms to replace non-dairy vegetarian, including ''dairyban'', ''vitan'', ''benevore'', ''sanivore'' and ''beaumangeur''. Watson decided on ''vegan'', pronounced ''veegun'' ({{IPA|/ˈviːɡən/}}), with the stress on the first syllable. As he put it in 2004, the word consisted of the first three and last two letters of vegetarian, "the beginning and end of vegetarian." He called the new group the Vegan Society. Its first newsletter – priced 2[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]], or 1[[Shilling (British coin)|/-]] for a year's subscription – was distributed to 500 people.<ref name=veganword>For the other terms and the Watson quote, see [http://www.vegparadise.com/24carrot610.html "Interview with Donald Watson"], ''Vegetarians in Paradise'', 11 August 2004.

Stepaniak writes that two vegan books appeared in 1946: the Leicester Vegetarian Society published ''Vegetarian Recipes without Dairy Produce'' by Margaret B. Rawls in the spring, and that summer the Vegan Society published ''Vegan Recipes'' by Fay K. Henderson.<ref>Stepaniak 2000(a), [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&pg=PA5 p. 5].</ref>
In 1951 the Vegan Society broadened its definition of veganism to "the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals," and pledged to seek an end to the use of animals "for food, commodities, work, hunting, vivisection and all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man."<ref name=Cross1951>Cross, Leslie. [http://www.ivu.org/history/world-forum/1951vegan.html "Veganism Defined"], ''The Vegetarian World Forum'', 5(1), Spring 1951: "In a vegan world the creatures would be reintegrated within the balance and sanity of nature ''as she is in herself''. A great and historic wrong, whose effect upon the course of evolution must have been stupendous, would be righted. The idea that his fellow creatures might be used by man for self-interested purposes would be so alien to human thought as to be almost unthinkable. In this light, veganism is not so much welfare as liberation, for the creatures and for the mind and heart of man; not so much an effort to make the present relationship bearable, as an uncompromising recognition that because it is in the main one of master and slave, it has to be abolished before something better and finer can be built."
*The Vegan Society wrote in 1979 that the word ''veganism'' "denotes a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude – as far as is possible and practical – all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives ..." See [http://www.vegansociety.com/pdf/ArticlesofAssociation.pdf "Memorandum of Association of the Vegan Society"], Vegan Society, 20 November 1979.</ref> Leslie Cross, by then the society's vice-president, wrote: "[V]eganism is not so much welfare as liberation, for the creatures and for the mind and heart of man; not so much an effort to make the present relationship bearable, as an uncompromising recognition that because it is in the main one of master and slave, it has to be abolished before something better and finer can be built."<ref name=Cross1951/>

===Founding of the American Vegan Society (1960)===
{{further|American Vegan Society}}
The first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by a nurse and chiropractor, Catherine Nimmo (1887–1985) of Oceano, California, and Rubin Abramowitz of Los Angeles. Originally from the Netherlands, Nimmo had been a vegan since 1931, and when the British Vegan Society was founded she began distributing its newsletter, ''The Vegan News'', to her mailing list within the United States.<ref>For Nimmo's dates and background, see Austin, Linda and Hammond, Norm.

Jay Dinshah]] (1933–2000), the son of a [[Parsi]] from Mumbai, visited a slaughterhouse and read some of Watson's literature. He gave up all animal products, and on 8 February 1960 founded the American Vegan Society (AVS) in Malaga, New Jersey. He incorporated Nimmo's society and explicitly linked veganism to the concept of ''ahimsa'', a Sanskrit word meaning "non-harming." The AVS called the idea "dynamic harmlessness," and named its magazine ''Ahimsa''.<ref>Stepaniak 2000(a), [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&pg=PA6 pp. 6–7]; Phelps 2007, [http://books.google.com/books?id=zrncZO5bmAgCpg=PA187 p. 187].

From the 1990s onwards, their arguments about the health benefits, together with growing concern for the welfare of animals raised in factory farms, led to an increased interest in veganism. In January 2011 the Associated Press (AP) reported that the vegan diet was moving from marginal to mainstream in the United States, with vegan books such as ''[[Skinny Bitch]]'' (2005) becoming best sellers, and several celebrities exploring vegan diets: "Today's vegans are urban hipsters, suburban moms, college students, even professional athletes." According to the AP, over half the 1,500 chefs polled in 2011 by the National Restaurant Association included vegan entrees in their restaurants, and chain restaurants began to mark vegan items on their menus.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-204_162-7216497.html "Vegan diets becoming more popular, more mainstream"], Associated Press, 6 January 2011.</ref>

The issue that divided the early vegetarians – whether avoiding animal products was a moral issue, or for the most part a health one – persists. Dietary vegans avoid eating or drinking anything that contains an animal product (no meat, fish, eggs or dairy products) out of concern for human health or animal welfare, but may continue to use animal products in clothing, toiletries and other areas.<ref>Francione and Garner 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&pg=PA257 p. 257].</ref> Against this, ethical vegans see veganism as a philosophy. They reject the commodity or property status of animals, and refrain entirely from using them or products derived from them; they will not use animals for food, clothing, entertainment or any other purpose.<ref>Francione, in Francione and Garner 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&pg=PA62 p. 62]: "Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals, of the notion that animals have only external value, and of the notion that animals have less moral value than do humans."
*Joanne Stepaniak, author of ''[[The Vegan Sourcebook]]'' (2000), argues that to place the qualifier "dietary" before "vegan" is akin to using the term "secular Catholic" for people who want to practise only some aspects of Catholicism. See [[Joanne Stepaniak|Stepaniak, Joanne]]. ''Being Vegan''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000 (hereafter Stepaniak 2000(b)), [http://books.google.com/books?id=EOYw_DNO3AsC&pg=PA10 p. 10].

Ethical vegans entirely reject the [[commodification]] of animals.

*Also see [http://www.americanvegan.org/vegan.htm "What is Vegan?"], American Vegan Society, accessed 17 December 2012: "Vegans exclude flesh, fish, fowl, dairy products (animal milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, etc.), eggs, honey, animal gelatin, and all other foods of animal origin. Veganism also excludes animal products such as leather, wool, fur, and silk in clothing, upholstery, etc. Vegans usually make efforts to avoid the less-than-obvious animal oils, secretions, etc., in many products such as soaps, cosmetics, toiletries, household goods and other common commodities."</ref>

An animal product is any material derived from animals, including meat, poultry, seafood, [[egg (food)|eggs]], dairy products, honey, fur, leather, wool, and silk. Other commonly used, but perhaps less well-known, animal products are [[beeswax]], [[bone char]], [[bone china]], [[carmine]], [[casein]], [[cochineal]], [[gelatin]], [[isinglass]], [[lanolin]], [[lard]], [[rennet]], [[shellac]], [[tallow]], [[whey]], and [[yellow grease]].

*The detailed reasons vegans may not use a specific animal product are varied. In the case of wool, for example, [[Merino]] sheep have been bred to have wrinkly skin and extra-thick wool that can lead to heat exhaustion in summer and maggot infestations, which leads to the practice of [[mulesing]].

Ethical vegans will not use animal products for clothing, toiletries, or any other reason, and will try to avoid ingredients that have been tested on animals. They will not buy fur coats, cars with leather in them, leather shoes, belts, bags, wallets, woollen jumpers, silk scarves, camera film, bedding that contains goose down or duck feathers, and will not use certain vaccines; the production of the flu vaccine, for example, involves the use of chicken eggs. Depending on their economic circumstances, vegans may donate items made from animal products to charity when they become vegan, or use them until they wear out. Clothing made without animal products is widely available in stores and online. Alternatives to wool include acrylic, cotton, hemp, rayon and polyester. Some vegan clothes, in particular shoes and leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage associated with production.<ref>Stepaniak 2000(a), [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&pg=PA20 pp. 20], [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&pg=PA115 115–118], [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&pg=PA154 154]; see [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&pg=PA116 p. 116] for the environmental damage associated with petroleum-based products.</ref>

=== Milk and eggs ===
{{further|Dairy product|Egg (food)}}
One of the main differences between vegan and vegetarian diets is that vegan diets exclude both eggs and dairy products (such as animal milk, cheese, butter and yogurt). Ethical vegans state that the production of eggs and dairy causes animal suffering and premature death. For example, in both [[battery cage]] and [[free-range eggs|free-range egg]] production, most male [[Chick culling|chicks are culled]] at birth because they will not lay eggs, and there is no financial incentive for a producer to keep them.<ref name=egg>[http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=587# "Egg Production & Welfare"], Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 December 2012.</ref>

[[File:Smoker.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|Vegans differ about the use of honey.]]
To produce milk from [[dairy cattle]], dairy cows are kept almost permanently pregnant through [[artificial insemination]] to prolong [[lactation]]. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for [[veal]] production, or reared for beef. Female calves are separated from their mothers a few days after birth and fed milk replacer, so that the cow's milk is retained for human consumption.<ref name=milk>[http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=556 "Dairy Cows & Welfare"], Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 December 2012.</ref> After about five years, once the cow's milk production has dropped, they are considered "spent" and sent to slaughter for hamburger meat and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.<ref>[[Erik Marcus|Marcus, Erik]]. ''Veganism: The New Ethics of Eating''. McBooks Press, 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ONYfgAGyvPQC&pg=PA128 pp. 128–129].</ref> The situation is similar with goats and their [[Goat#Reproduction|kids]].<ref>[http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=528 "Goats"], Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 January 2013.</ref>

===Honey and other insect products===
{{further|Honey bee|Beekeeping}}
There is disagreement among vegan groups about the extent to which products from insects must be avoided. Some vegans view the consumption of honey as cruel and exploitative, and modern beekeeping a form of enslavement.<ref>Engber, Daniel. [http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2008/07/the_great_vegan_honey_debate.html "The Great Vegan Honey Debate: Is honey the dairy of the insect world?"], ''Slate'', 30 July 2008.</ref> Once the honey (the bees' natural food store) is harvested, it is common practice to substitute it with sugar or [[corn syrup]] to maintain the colony over winter. Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers the use of honey, silk or other insect products to be suitable for vegans, while Vegan Action and Vegan Outreach regard it as a matter of personal choice.<ref name=honey>[http://vegansociety.com/uploadedFiles/User_Hubpages/Education/Education_Resources/Honey.pdf "Honey: Ain't so sweet for the bees"], Vegan Society, accessed 16 December 2012.

==Vegan diet==
===Common dishes and ingredients===
:''Further information: [[b:Category:Vegan recipes|Vegan recipes]]''
{{Cookbook|Vegan cuisine|Vegan substitutions}}
Common vegan dishes include [[ratatouille]], [[falafel]], [[hummus]], veggie [[burrito]]s, [[rice and beans]], veggie stir-fry, veggie burgers, and [[pasta primavera]]. Ingredients made from [[soybean]]s are a staple of vegan diets because soybeans are a [[complete protein]].<ref name=Mangels2011p256/> They are consumed most often in the form of [[soy milk]] and [[tofu]] (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant; tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm and extra firm for stews and stir-fries, to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of [[tempeh]] and [[texturized vegetable protein]] (TVP) (also known as textured soy protein, TSP); the latter is often used in pasta sauces.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA444 p. 444].</ref> The wheat-based [[seitan]]/[[gluten]] is another common source of plant protein. [[Meat analogue]]s, or mock meats, also based on soy or gluten, come in the form of [[vegetarian sausage]], vegetarian mince and [[veggie burger]]s, and are usually free of animal products.

===Plant milk, ice-cream and cheese===
{{anchor|Plant milk, ice-cream and cheese}}
[[File:Soy milk.jpg|thumb|160px|alt=photograph|[[Soy milk]] is a [[complete protein]].]]
[[Plant cream]] and [[plant milk]] – such as soy milk, [[almond milk]], [[grain milk]] (oat milk and [[rice milk]]) and [[coconut milk]] – are used instead of cows' or goats' milk. The most widely available are soy and almond milk. Soy milk provides around 7 g of protein [[Cup (unit)|per cup]] (250 ml or 8 fluid ounces). Almond milk has fewer calories but less protein.<ref name=Reinagel2011p20-21>Reinagel, Monica. ''Nutrition Diva's Secrets for a Healthy Diet''. Macmillan 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=cvJ4-qB0hOUC&pg=PA20 pp. 20–21].</ref>

Like animal milk and meat, soy milk is a complete protein, meaning that it contains all the [[essential amino acid]]s and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake.<ref name=Mangels2011p256>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA256 pp. 256–257]: "Soy protein products typically have a protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) ... >0.9, which is similar to that of meat and milk protein. Consequently, consuming the recommended dietary allowance (RDA, 0.8 mg/kg body weight [bw]), for protein entirely in the form of soy will meet the biologic requirement for amino acids. ... Formal recognition of the high quality of soy protein came in the form of a ruling by the USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] allowing soy protein to replace 100 percent of meat protein in the Federal School Lunch Program."</ref> Soy milk alone should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies; babies who are not breastfed need commercial [[infant formula]], which is normally based on cow's milk or soy (the latter is known as [[Soybean#Infant formula|soy-based infant formula]] or SBIF).<ref>[[Reed Mangels|Mangels, Reed]].

Since 1991, the [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]] (PCRM) has recommended a no-cholesterol, low-fat vegan diet based on what they call the Four New Food Groups: legumes, grains, fruits, and vegetables. This was intended to replace the [[Four Food Groups]] – meat, dairy, grains, fruits and vegetables – recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) from 1956 until 1992.<ref>Folsom, Kim. ''Nutrition in a Nutshell''. iUniverse, 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6mBwYUaN628C&pg=PA44 pp. 43–44].

*[http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/protein-foods.html "Protein foods"], United States Department of Agriculture.</ref> In the UK, the government recommends the [[eatwell plate]], also consisting of five groups, though not the same groups as the American model: fruits and vegetables; potatoes, bread and other starchy foods; dairy products; meat, fish, eggs or beans for protein; and fat and sugar.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx "The eatwell plate"], National Health Service.</ref>

In contrast, the four vegan food groups are fruit, [[legume]]s, grains, and vegetables. Legumes include peas, [[beans]], lentils and peanuts. PCRM recommends three or more servings a day of fruit (including at least one that is high in vitamin C, such as citrus fruit, melon, or strawberries), two or more of protein-rich legumes (such as soybeans, which can be consumed as soy milk, tofu, or tempeh), five or more of [[whole grain]]s (such as corn, barley, rice, and wheat, in products such as bread and tortillas), and four or more of vegetables (dark-green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, and dark-yellow and orange such as carrots or sweet potatoes).<ref name=foodgroups>[http://www.pcrm.org/search/?cid=137 "The Four New Food Groups"], Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, accessed 16 January 2013.</ref>

[[File:Red beans and rice.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|[[Rice and beans]] is a common vegan [[Protein combining|protein combination]].]]
[[Protein]]s are composed of [[amino acid]]s. [[Reed Mangels]] of the department of nutrition at the University of Massachusetts Amherst writes that [[omnivore]]s generally obtain a third of their protein from plant foods, and ovo-lacto vegetarians a half.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA71 p. 71]; for their chapter on protein, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA65 pp. 65–79].</ref> Vegans obtain all their protein from plant sources, and a common question is whether plant protein can supply an adequate intake of the [[essential amino acid]]s, which cannot be synthesized by the human body.<ref name=Krajcovicova>Krajcovicova-Kudlackova, M.; Babinska, K; and Valachovicova, M. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16201743 "Health benefits and risks of plant proteins"], ''Bratisl Lek Listy'', 106(6–7), 2005, pp. 231–234 (review article).</ref> 

Sources of plant protein include legumes, such as soy beans (commonly consumed as [[tofu]], [[tempeh]], texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and [[edamame]]), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (often eaten as [[hummus]]); grains, such as [[quinoa]] (pronounced ''keenwa''), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (often eaten as whole-wheat bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds, such as almonds, hemp and sunflower seeds.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA72 pp. 72], [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA78 78].
*Norris, Jack and Messina, Virginia. [http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/protein#table3 "Protein & Amino Acids in Common Foods"], Vegan Outreach, December 2010.</ref>

Soy beans and quinoa are known as [[complete protein]]s because they each contain all the essential amino acids.<ref>Messina, M. and Messina, V. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22254060 "The role of soy in vegetarian diets"], ''Nutrients'', 2(8), August 2010, pp. 855–888 (review article).

They add that the United States Department of Agriculture has ruled that soy protein may replace meat protein in the [[School meal programs in the United States|Federal School Lunch Program]].<ref name=Mangels2011p256/> 

Traditional combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids are [[rice and beans]], corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita. A 1994 study found that a varied intake of such sources was sufficient, and the American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that a variety of plant foods consumed over the course of a day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that [[protein combining]] in the same meal may not be necessary.<ref>Young, V.R. and Pellett, P.L. [http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/59/5/1203S.abstract "Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition"], ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', 59(5), May 1994, pp. 1203S–1212S.
*For the ADA, see Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA75 p. 75ff].</ref> Mangels ''et al'' write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution (taking into account the lower digestibility and poorer amino acid pattern of plant protein), they would recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA77 p. 77].</ref> According to a 2005 [[review article]], studies suggest that an adequate intake of plant proteins protects against certain degenerative diseases.<ref name=Krajcovicova/>

====Vitamin B12====
{{further|Vitamin B12 deficiency|Food fortification}}
[[File:Seitan.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|Mock meats, such as [[seitan]], are often fortified with vitamin B12.]]
[[Vitamin B12]] is a bacterial product needed for [[cell division]], the formation and maturation of [[red blood cell]]s, the [[DNA replication|synthesis of DNA]], and for normal [[nerve]] function. A B12 deficiency can lead to a number of health problems, including [[megaloblastic anemia]] and nerve damage.<ref name=Mangels>Mangels, Reed; Messina, Virginia; and Messina, Mark. "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)," ''The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets''. Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA181 pp. 181–192].

''Vegan for Life''. Da Capo Press, 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=MjfDtYYSyJMC&pg=PA34 p. 34].</ref>

Neither plants nor animals make B12; it is produced by microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi and algae. [[Herbivorous]] animals obtain it from bacteria in their [[rumen]]s, either by absorbing it or by eating their own [[cecotrope]] faeces; rabbits, for example, produce and eat cecal pellets. When those animals are eaten, they become sources of B12. Plants from the ground that are not washed properly may contain B12 from bacteria in the soil, often from faeces; drinking water may also be contaminated with B12-producing bacteria, particularly in the developing world.<ref name=Mangels/> Mangels ''et al'' write that bacteria in the human digestive tract produce B12, but most of it is not absorbed and is expelled in the faeces, with tiny amounts also expelled in the urine. James Halsted, a medical researcher, reported in the 1960s that a group of villagers in Iran eating very little or no animal protein were found to have normal B12 levels because they were living with animal manure near their homes, and were eating vegetables grown in human manure (known as [[night soil]]) and not thoroughly washed. The human mouth is another source of B12, but in small amounts and possibly analogue (not biologically active).<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA188 p. 188].

Western vegan diets are likely to be deficient in B12 because of increased hygiene. Vegans can obtain B12 by taking a supplement or by eating fortified foods, such as fortified soy milk or cereal, where it may be listed as [[cobalamin]] or [[cyanocobalamin]].<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA179 p. 179].
*For the point about hygiene, also see [http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/48/3/852.full.pdf Herbert 1988], p. 854: "[S]trict vegetarians who do not practice thorough hand washing or vegetable cleaning may be untroubled by vitamin B-12 deficiency."</ref> B12 supplements are produced industrially through [[Bacterial fermentation|bacterial fermentation-synthesis]]; no animal products are involved in that process. The [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] for adults (14+ years) is 2.4 [[Microgram|mcg]] (or µg) a day, rising to 2.4 and 2.6 mcg for pregnancy and lactation respectively; 0.4 mcg for 0–6 months, 0.5 mcg for 7–12 months, 0.9 mcg for 1–3 years, 1.2 mcg for 4–8 years, and 1.8 mcg for 9–13 years.<ref>For the RDA, see [http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/ "Vitamin B12"], Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health, accessed 16 January 2013.</ref>

There is some disagreement within the vegan community as to whether supplementation is needed; several studies of vegans who did not take supplements or eat fortified food, including in Western countries, have found no sign of B12 deficiency.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA183 pp. 183–184].</ref> Mangels ''et al'' write that the disagreement is caused in part because there is no gold standard for assessing B12 status, and also because there are very few studies of long-term vegans who have not used supplements or fortified foods. According to Mangels, all Western vegans not using supplements or fortified foods will probably develop a B12 deficiency, though it may take decades to appear.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA182 pp. 182–183].</ref> There are reports that certain plant foods are sources of B12. Mangels ''et al'' write that fermented foods such as tempeh and [[miso]], as well as [[edible seaweed]] (such as [[arame]], [[wakame]], [[nori]], and kombo), [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], and certain greens, grains and legumes, have been cited as B12 sources, as has rainwater. Tiny amounts have been found in [[barley malt syrup]], [[Shiitake|shiitake mushroom]]s, [[parsley]] and [[sourdough]] bread, and higher amounts in spirulina and nori, but these products may be sources of inactive B12.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA187 p. 187].</ref> The consensus within the mainstream nutrition community is that vegans and perhaps even vegetarians should eat fortified foods or use supplements.<ref name=NorrisJuly262006>Norris, Jack.

====Calcium====
{{further|Calcium in biology|Calcium carbonate|Calcium citrate|Disorders of calcium metabolism}}
[[File:Bokchoycooked.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|[[Bok choi]] is high in calcium.]]
[[Calcium]] is needed to maintain [[Bone density|bone health]], and for a number of [[Metabolism|metabolic]] functions, including [[Muscle#Function|muscle function]], [[Muscle contraction|vascular contraction]] and [[vasodilation]], nerve transmission, [[Cell signaling|intracellular signalling]] and [[Hormone|hormonal]] secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. The [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] is 200&nbsp;mg for 0–6 months, 260&nbsp;mg for 7–12 months, 700&nbsp;mg for 1–3 years, 1,000&nbsp;mg for 4–8 years, 1,300&nbsp;mg for 9–18 years, 1,000&nbsp;mg for 19–50 years, 1,000&nbsp;mg for 51–70 years (men) and 1,200&nbsp;mg (women), and 1,200&nbsp;mg for 71+ years.<ref name=calcium-NIH>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/ "Calcium"], Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health.

Vegans are advised to eat three servings per day of a high-calcium food, such as fortified soy milk, fortified tofu, almonds or hazelnuts, and to take a supplement as necessary.<ref name=dietitians/> Plant sources include broccoli, turnip and cabbage, such as Chinese cabbage ([[bok choi]]) and [[kale]]; the bioavailability of calcium in spinach is poor. Whole-wheat bread contains calcium; grains contain small amounts.<ref name=calcium-NIH/> Because vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption, vegans should make sure they also consume enough vitamin D (see [[#Vitamin D|below]]).<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA110 p. 110].</ref>

The [[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition|EPIC-Oxford]] study suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake, but that vegans consuming more than 525&nbsp;mg/day have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups.<ref>Appleby P, ''et al''. [http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v61/n12/full/1602659a.html "Comparative fracture risk in vegetarians and nonvegetarians in EPIC-Oxford"], ''European Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', 61(12), February 2007, pp. 1400–1406.
*Also see Norris, Jack. [http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/bones "Bones, Vitamin D, and Calcium"], Vegan Outreach, 9 January 2007: "Based on research showing that vegans who consumed less than 525 mg per day of calcium had higher bone fracture rates than people who consumed more than 525 mg per day (14), vegans should make sure they get a minimum of 525 mg of calcium per day. It would be best to get 700 mg per day for adults, and at least 1,000 mg for people age 13 to 18 when bones are developing. This can most easily be satisfied for most vegans by eating high-calcium greens on a daily basis and drinking a nondairy milk that is fortified with calcium."</ref> A 2009 study of bone density found the bone mineral density (BMD) of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant. Another study in 2009 by the same researchers examined over 100 vegan post-menopausal women, and found that their diet had no adverse effect on BMD and no alteration in body composition.<ref>Ho-Pham, L.T., ''et al''.

====Vitamin D====
{{further|Vitamin D deficiency|Rickets|Hypervitaminosis D}}
[[File:The Sun Edit1.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|According to the [[National Institutes of Health]], most people can obtain enough vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall.<ref name=VitD-NIH/>]]
[[Vitamin D]] (calciferol) is needed for a number of functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=VitD-NIH/> Mangels writes that it may also play a role in protecting against heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, multiple sclerosis and dementia.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA205 p. 205].

It is present in very few foods (mostly salmon, tuna, mackerel, cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks and beef liver, and in some mushrooms).<ref name=VitD-NIH>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/ "Vitamin D"], Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health.
*For more details, see [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050 Ross ''et al'' (Food and Nutrition Board) 2011].</ref>

Most vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D, unless the food is fortified (such as fortified soy milk), so supplements may be needed depending on exposure to sunlight.<ref name=VitD-NIH/> Vitamin D comes in two forms. [[Cholecalciferol]] (D3) is synthesized in the skin after exposure to the sun and may be consumed in the form of animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from [[lanolin]] in sheep's wool. [[Ergocalciferol]] (D2) is suitable for vegans; it is mostly human-made and is derived from [[ergosterol]] from yeast. Several conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms may or may not be bioequivalent.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA209 p. 209].
*That D2 is mostly human-made, see Ross ''et al'' (Food and Nutrition Board) 2011, [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050&page=75 p. 75].</ref> According to a 2011 report by the Food and Nutrition Board of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], the differences between D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as [[prohormone]]s, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.<ref>Ross ''et al'' (Food and Nutrition Board) 2011, [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050&page=75 p. 75].</ref>

Supplements should be used with caution because vitamin D can be toxic, especially in children.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA208 p. 208].</ref> The [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] is 10 mcg for 0–12 months, 15 mcg for 1–70 years, and 20 mcg for 70+.<ref name=VitD-NIH/> People with little or no sun exposure may need more, perhaps up to 25 mcg daily.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA207 pp. 207–208].</ref> The daily [[Tolerable upper intake levels|tolerable upper intake level]] (daily) for 9 years to adulthood is 100 mcg, according to the National Institutes of Health; for children it is 25 mcg for 0–6 months, 38 mcg for 7–12 months, 63 mcg for 1–3 years, and 75 mcg for 4–8 years.<ref name=VitD-NIH/>

The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient to meet the body's needs will depend on the time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin [[melanin]] content, whether sunscreen is worn, and the season. According to the US [[National Institutes of Health]], most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall months, even in the far north. They report that some vitamin D researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between ten in the morning and three o'clock in the afternoon, at least twice a week. They also report that tanning beds emitting two to six per cent UVB radiation will have a similar effect, though using tanning beds may be inadvisable for other reasons.<ref name=VitD-NIH/>

====Iron====
{{further|Human iron metabolism|Iron supplement|Iron deficiency}}
[[File:Blackstrapmolasses.JPG|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|[[Molasses]] is high in iron.]]
Vegetarian and vegan diets usually contain as much iron as animal-based diets, or more; vegan diets generally contain more iron than vegetarian ones because dairy products contain very little. There are concerns about the bioavailability of iron from plant foods, assumed by some researchers to be around 5–15 percent compared to 18 percent from a nonvegetarian diet.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA138 p. 138ff], 143–144.
*For a detailed discussion of iron and nutrition, see [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10026&page=290 "Iron"], Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academy Press, 2001, pp. 290–393.</ref> [[Iron deficiency anaemia]] is found as often in nonvegetarians as in vegetarians, though studies have shown vegetarians' iron stores to be lower.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA146 p. 146].</ref>

The [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] for nonvegetarians is 11&nbsp;mg for 7–12 months, 7&nbsp;mg for 1–3 years, 10&nbsp;mg for 4–8 years, and 8&nbsp;mg for 9–13 years. The RDA then changes for men and women to 11&nbsp;mg for 14–18 years (men) and 15&nbsp;mg for 14–18 years (women), 8&nbsp;mg for 19–50 years (men) and 18&nbsp;mg for 19–50 years (women). It return to 8&nbsp;mg for 51+ years (men and women).<ref name=iron-NIH>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/ "Iron"], Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health.</ref> Mangels writes that because of the lower bioavailability of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14&nbsp;mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33&nbsp;mg for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives.<ref>Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA143 p. 143].</ref> Supplements should be used only with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate within the body and cause damage to organs; this is particularly true of anyone suffering from [[hemochromatosis]], a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed. The daily tolerable upper intake level, according to the [[National Institutes of Health]], is 40&nbsp;mg for 7 months to 13 years, and 45&nbsp;mg for 14+.<ref name=iron-NIH/>

According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, high-iron foods suitable for vegans include black-strap molasses, lentils, tofu, quinoa, kidney beans and chickpeas.<ref>Breier, Davida Gypsy and [[Reed Mangels|Mangels, Reed]].

Vegetarian Resource Group, 2001, [http://books.google.com/books?id=MdrSAAra88IC&pg=PA27 p. 27].</ref> Tom Sanders, a nutritionist at King's College London, writes that iron absorption can be enhanced by eating a source of vitamin C along with a plant source of iron, and by avoiding coingesting anything that would inhibit absorption, such as [[tannin]] in tea.<ref>Sanders, T.A. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=795552 "The nutritional adequacy of plant-based diets"], ''The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society'', 58(2), 1999, pp. 265–269.

====Omega-3 fatty acids====
{{further|Essential fatty acid interactions}}
[[File:From flax to linseed oil..JPG|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|[[Flaxseed oil]] contains a high level of [[alpha-linolenic acid]], an [[omega-3 fatty acid]].]]
[[Alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found in leafy green vegetables and nuts, and in vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oil. The [[Adequate Intake]] for ALA is 1.1–1.6 g/day.<ref>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcidsandHealth-HealthProfessional/ "Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Health"], Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health.</ref> Vegan Outreach suggests vegans take 1/4 teaspoon of flaxseed oil (also known as linseed oil) daily, and use oils containing low amounts of [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s, such as olive, canola, avocado or peanut oil.<ref>Norris, Jack.

====Iodine====
{{further|Iodine in biology|Iodine deficiency}}
[[Iodine]] supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically [[Iodized salt|iodized]], where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil.<ref name=Appleby1999/> Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or from regular consumption of seaweeds, such as [[kelp]].<ref>[http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/iodine "Iodine"], Vegan Outreach, 26 December 2006: "Iodine is needed for healthy thyroid function which regulates metabolism. Both too much and too little iodine can result in abnormal thyroid metabolism. ... Studies have shown that vegans in Europe (where salt is either not iodized or not iodized at high enough levels) who do not supplement (as well as those who oversupplement) have indications of abnormal thyroid function."

===Health arguments===
{{further|Vegan nutrition|Raw veganism}}
There is growing scientific consensus that a plant-based diet reduces the risk of a number of degenerative diseases, including coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, [[osteoporosis]], [[kidney disease]] and [[dementia]].<ref name=disease>Note that several sources use the word "vegetarian" to refer to an entirely plant-based diet:
*[[:de:Claus Leitzmann|Leitzmann, Claus]]. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702597 "Vegetarian diets: what are the advantages?"], ''Forum of Nutrition'', 57, 2005, pp.&nbsp;147–156 ([[review article]]): "A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that wholesome vegetarian diets offer distinct advantages compared to diets containing meat and other foods of animal origin. The benefits arise from lower intakes of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein as well as higher intakes of complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C and E, carotenoids and other phytochemicals. ... In most cases, vegetarian diets are beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, renal disease and dementia, as well as diverticular disease, gallstones and rheumatoid arthritis."
*Also see [http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/publications/dietaryguidelines/2010/policydoc/execsumm.pdf "Building healthy eating patterns"], ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans'', United States Department of Agriculture, 2010, p.&nbsp;45: "In prospective studies of adults, compared to non-vegetarian eating patterns, vegetarian-style eating patterns have been associated with improved health outcomes – lower levels of obesity, a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and lower total mortality. Several clinical trials have documented that vegetarian eating patterns lower blood pressure.<p> "On average, vegetarians consume a lower proportion of calories from fat (in particular, saturated fatty acids); fewer overall calories; and more fiber, potassium, and vitamin C than do non-vegetarians. In general, vegetarians have a lower body mass index. These characteristics and other lifestyle factors associated with a vegetarian diet may contribute to the positive health outcomes that have been identified among vegetarians."

Between 1980 and 1984 the Oxford Vegetarian Study recruited 11,000 subjects (6000 vegetarians and a control group of 5000 non-vegetarians) and followed up after 12 years. The study indicated that vegans had lower total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations than the meat-eaters, and that death rates were lower in the non-meat eaters. The authors wrote that mortality from [[ischemic heart disease]] was positively associated with higher dietary cholesterol levels and the consumption of animal fat. They also wrote that the non-meat-eaters had half the risk of the meat eaters of requiring an emergency appendectomy, and that vegans in the UK may be prone to iodine deficiency.<ref name=Appleby1999>Appleby, Paul N., ''et al''.

A 1999 [[meta-analysis]] of five studies comparing mortality rates in Western countries found that mortality from ischemic heart disease was 26 percent lower in vegans than in regular meat-eaters. This was compared to 20 percent lower in occasional meat eaters, 34 percent lower in [[pescetarian]]s (those who ate fish but no other meat), and 34 percent lower in ovo-lacto vegetarians (those who ate no meat, but did consume animal milk and eggs). No significant difference in mortality from other causes was found between vegetarian/vegan and non-vegetarian diets.<ref>Key, Timothy J. ''et al''.

Because animal ingredients are cheap, they are ubiquitous in toiletries. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers (bones, brains, eyes, spines and other parts) are put through the [[Rendering (animals)|rendering]] process, and some of that material, especially the [[Animal fat|fats]], ends up in toiletries and cosmetics.  Vegans often refer to ''Animal Ingredients A to Z'' (2004) to check which ingredients might be animal-derived. Common animal products in toiletries include [[tallow]] in soap, and [[glycerine]] (derived from [[collagen]]), which is used as a lubricant and [[humectant]] in haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foam, soap and toothpaste; there is a plant-based form but the glycerine in most products is probably animal-based. [[Lanolin]], from sheep's wool, is another common ingredient, found in lip balm and moisturizers, as is [[stearic acid]], used in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, there is a plant-based form of stearic acid, but most mainstream manufacturers use the animal-derived form. [[Lactic acid]], an [[alpha-hydroxy acid]] derived from animal milk, is often found in moisturizers, as is [[allantoin]], derived from the comfrey plant or cow's urine, and found in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste.<ref>Torres and Torres 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5A1dyppuhmUC&pg=PA201 pp. 201–203].

==Philosophy: ethical and environmental perspectives==
===Ethical veganism===
====Arguments====
{{further|Animal rights|Ethics of eating meat}}
[[File:Carol J. Adams with Snowball.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|Feminist writer [[Carol J. Adams]] calls animals the [[absent referent]].]]
Ethical veganism is based on opposition to [[speciesism]], the assignment of different values to individuals on the basis of their species membership alone. [[Bob Torres]] and Jenna Torres, authors of ''Vegan Freak'' (2005), write that ethical veganism consists of "living life consciously as an [[Speciesism|anti-speciesist]]."<ref>Torres and Torres 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5A1dyppuhmUC&pg=PA60 p. 60].</ref> [[Carol J. Adams]], the vegan-feminist writer, has used the concept of the [[absent referent]] to describe what she calls a psycho-social detachment between the consumer and the consumed. She wrote in ''The Sexual Politics of Meat'' (1990):

<blockquote>Behind every meal of meat is an absence: the death of the animal whose place the meat takes. The 'absent referent' is that which separates the meat eater from the animal and the animal from the end product. The function of the absent referent is to keep our 'meat' separated from any idea that she or he was once an animal, to keep the 'moo' or 'cluck' or 'baa' away from the meat, to keep ''something'' from being seen as having been some''one''."<ref>Adams, Carol J. ''The Sexual Politics of Meat''. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000 (first published 1990), [http://books.google.com/books?id=AwrwRKNavtAC&pg=PA14 p. 14].</ref></blockquote>

There is a division within animal rights theory between a rights-based or [[Deontological ethics|deontological approach]] and a [[Animal rights#Utilitarian approach|utilitarian]] one, which is reflected in the debate about the moral basis of veganism. [[Tom Regan]], professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University, is a rights theorist who argues that animals possess inherent value as "subjects-of-a-life" – because they have beliefs and desires, an emotional life, memory, and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals – and must therefore be viewed as ends in themselves, not as a means to an end.<ref>Regan, Tom. ''The Case for Animal Rights''. University of California Press, 1983 (hereafter Regan 1983), [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&pg=PA243 p. 243].</ref> He argues that the right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden only when outweighed by other valid moral principles, but that the reasons cited for eating animal products – pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers – are not weighty enough to override the animals' moral rights.<ref>Regan 1983, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&pg=PA333 pp. 333–334], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&pg=PA394 394].</ref>

[[File:Gary Francione.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=photograph| [http://vimeo.com/23001319 Video] of law professor [[Gary Francione]] speaking about veganism, 2009]]
[[Gary L. Francione]], professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, is also a rights theorist. He argues that "all sentient beings should have at least one right – the right not to be treated as property," and that adopting veganism must be the unequivocal baseline for anyone who sees nonhuman animals as having intrinsic moral value. To fail to do so is like arguing for human rights while continuing to own human slaves, he writes. Francione sees no coherent difference between eating meat and eating dairy or eggs: animals used in the dairy and egg industries live longer, are treated worse and end up in the same slaughterhouses.<ref>Francione and Garner 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&pg=PA62 p. 62ff.]
*Also see Francione, Gary. [http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/index.php?page_id=54 "Veganism as Abolition"], Animal Rights: The Abolitionist Approach, accessed 17 December 2012.</ref> He argues that the predicate for veganism is "already set":

<blockquote> We all believe it's wrong to inflict unnecessary suffering and death on animals. ... So now the next question becomes "what do we mean by necessity?" Well, whatever it means, whatever abstract meaning it has, if it has any meaning whatsoever, its minimal meaning has to be that it's wrong to inflict suffering and death on animals for reasons of pleasure, amusement or convenience – because if it's all right to inflict suffering and death on animals for reasons of pleasure, amusement or convenience, then you've got a loophole that's now so large you could drive a truck through it. So if the moral notion that we all accept, if that has any meaning, then it has got to be the case that we can't inflict suffering and death on animals for reasons of pleasure, amusement or convenience. Okay. Problem is 99.9999999 percent of our animal use can only be justified by reasons of pleasure, amusement or convenience. It's gotta go. If we mean what we say ... we have no choice. Veganism is the only rational, logical response ..."<ref>[http://vimeo.com/23001319 Interview with Gary Francione], vimeo, 2009, from 13:53 mins.</ref></blockquote> 

He argues that the pursuit of improved conditions for animals, rather than the [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolition of animal use]], is like campaigning for "conscientious rapists" who will rape their victims without beating them. The pursuit of animal welfare does not move us away from the paradigm of animals ''qua'' property, and serves only to make people feel comfortable about using them.<ref>Marcus, Erik. [http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/audio/#erik-marcus-20070225 "Erik Marcus Debates Professor Francione on Abolition vs. Animal Welfare"], Erik's Diner, 25 February 2007, from c. 2:20 mins ([http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/media/pdf/francione-marcus-debate.pdf transcript]).</ref>

====Debate about the "Paris exemption"====
[[Peter Singer]], professor of bioethics at Princeton University, approaches the issue from a utilitarian perspective. He argues that there is no moral or logical justification for refusing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making ethical decisions, and that sentience is "the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others."<ref>[[Peter Singer|Singer, Peter]]. ''[[Practical Ethics]]''. Cambridge University Press, 1999 (hereafter Singer 1999), [http://books.google.com/books?id=lNgnV0eDtM0C&pg=PA50 p. 50].</ref> He does not contend that killing animals is wrong in principle, but argues that from a consequentialist standpoint it should be rejected unless necessary for survival. He therefore advocates both veganism and improved conditions for farm animals to reduce suffering.<ref>Clyne, Catherine.

Unlike Francione, Singer is not concerned about what he calls trivial infractions of vegan principles, arguing that personal purity is not the issue. He supports what is known as the "Paris exemption": if you find yourself in a fine restaurant, allow yourself to eat what you want, and if you have no access to vegan food, going vegetarian is acceptable.<ref>Singer, Peter and Mason, Jim. ''The Way We Eat''. Rodale, 2006, pp. 282–283.
*The term "Paris exemption" was coined in 2004 by Daren Firestone, a Chicago law student. See Paulson, Amanda. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1027/p15s02-lifo.html "One woman's quest to enjoy her dinner without guilt"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 27 October 2004, p. 2.

[[File:Singer1.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] writes that personal purity is not the issue.]]
Singer's support for the "Paris exemption" is part of a debate within the animal rights movement about the extent to which it ought to promote veganism without exception. The positions are reflected by the divide between the [[Animal protectionism|animal protectionist]] side (represented by Singer and [[PETA]]), according to which incremental change can achieve real reform, and the [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] side (represented by Regan and Francione), according to which apparent welfare reform serves only to persuade the public that animal use is morally unproblematic. Singer said in 2006 that the movement should be more tolerant of people who choose to use animal products if they are careful about making sure the animals had a decent life.<ref>[http://www.satyamag.com/oct06/singer.html Clyne, October 2006].
*Also see Francione and Garner 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&pg=PA71 pp. 71–72].</ref> [[Bruce Friedrich]] of PETA argued in the same year that a strict adherence to veganism can become an obsession:

<blockquote>[W]e all know people whose reason for not going vegan is that they "can't" give up cheese or ice cream. ... Instead of encouraging them to stop eating all other animal products besides cheese or ice cream, we preach to them about the oppression of dairy cows. Then we go on about how we don’t eat sugar or a veggie burger because of the bun, even though a tiny bit of butter flavor in a bun contributes to significantly less suffering than any non-organic fruit or vegetable does or a plastic bottle or about 100 other things that most of us use. Our fanatical obsession with ingredients not only obscures the animals’ suffering – which was virtually non-existent for that tiny modicum of ingredient – but also nearly guarantees that those around us are not going to make any change at all. So, we’ve preserved our personal purity, but we’ve hurt animals – and that’s anti-vegan.<ref>Friedrich, Bruce. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080611232631/http://www.goveg.com/effectiveAdvocacy_personal.asp "Personal Purity versus Effective Advocacy"], PETA, 2006; also available [http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/animal-rights-debate/endnotes/222.pdf here].</ref></blockquote>

Francione writes that this position is similar to arguing that, because human rights abuses can never be eliminated entirely, we should not safeguard human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, in the interest of avoiding a fuss, he argues that we reinforce the idea that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience. He concludes from this that the PETA/Singer position fails even on its own consequentialist terms.<ref>Francione and Garner 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&pg=PA72 pp. 72–73].</ref>

{{further|Environmental vegetarianism|Vegan organic gardening}}
[[File:Gestcrate01.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=photograph|Female pigs in [[gestation crate]]s. Vegans see animal agriculture – in particular [[factory farming]] – as an infringement of the animals' rights and/or a threat to the environment.<ref>See, for example, Mason, Jim and Singer, Peter. ''Animal Factories: What Agribusiness is Doing to the Family Farm, the Environment and Your Health''. Harmony Books, 1990.</ref>]]
Environmental vegans focus on conservation rather than animal rights: they reject the use of animal products on the premise that practices such as farming – particularly [[factory farming]] – fishing, hunting and trapping are environmentally unsustainable.<ref name=environmental/> One example of an environmental vegan is [[Paul Watson]] of the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], the [[marine conservation]] direct-action group. He told ''The Guardian'' in 2010 that all Sea Shepherd ships are vegan: "Forty percent of the fish caught from the oceans is fed to livestock – pigs and chickens are becoming major aquatic predators. The livestock industry is one of the greatest contributors to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions ever. The eating of meat is an ecological disaster ...

In November 2006, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization released ''[[Livestock's Long Shadow]]'', a report that linked animal agriculture to environmental damage. It concluded that livestock farming (primarily of cows, chickens and pigs) has an impact on almost all aspects of the environment: air, land, soil, water, [[biodiversity]] and [[climate change]].<ref>Steinfeld, Henning ''et al''.

====Debate about animals killed in crop harvesting====
[[File:VeganRallyEvolve.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|220px|Vegans at the Melbourne "Walk against Warming," December 12, 2009, during the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Summit]] on climate change.]]
Steven Davis, a professor of [[animal science]] at Oregon State University, asked Tom Regan in 2001 what the difference was between killing a field mouse while cultivating crops, and killing a pig for the same reason, namely so that human beings could eat. Davis argued that a plant-based diet would kill more than one containing beef from grass-fed [[ruminant]]s.<ref name=Davis2001/> Andy Lamey, a philosopher at Monash University, calls this the "burger vegan" argument, namely that if human beings were to eat cows raised on a diet of grass, not grain, fewer animals would be killed overall, because the number of mice, rats, raccoons and other animals killed during the harvest outnumbers the deaths involved in raising cows for beef.<ref>Lamey, Andy. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1253172 "Food Fight! Davis versus Regan on the Ethics of Eating Beef"], ''Journal of Social Philosophy'', 38(2), 2009, pp. 331–348 (hereafter Lamey 2009), p. 331.</ref>

Based on a study finding that wood mouse populations dropped from 25 to five per hectare after harvest (attributed to migration and mortality), Davis estimated that 10 animals per hectare are killed from crop farming every year. He argued that if all {{convert|120000000|acre|km2}} of cropland in the continental United States were used for a vegan diet, approximately 500 million animals would die each year. But if half the cropland were converted to ruminant pastureland, he estimated that only 900,000 animals would die each year – assuming people switched from the eight billion poultry killed each year to beef, lamb and dairy products. Therefore, he argued, according to the least-harm principle we should convert to a ruminant-based diet rather than a plant-based one.<ref name=Davis2001>Davis, S.L. [http://www.letstalkfarmanimals.ca/2009/07/13/least-harm-principle-suggests-meat-dairy-diet/ "Least harm principle suggests that humans should eat beef, lamb, dairy, not a vegan diet"], ''Proceedings of the Third Congress of the European Society for Agricultural and Food Ethics'', 2001, pp.&nbsp;440–450.

Davis's analysis was criticized in 2003 by [[Jason Gaverick Matheny|Gaverick Matheny]] in the ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics''. Matheny argued that Davis had miscalculated the number of animal deaths based on land area rather than per consumer, and had confined his analysis to grass-fed ruminants, rather than factory-farmed animals. He wrote that Davis had also equated lives with lives worth living, focusing on numbers rather than including in his calculations the harm done to animals raised for food, which can involve pain from branding, dehorning and castration, a life of confinement, transport without food or water to a slaughterhouse, and a frightening death. Matheny argued that vegetarianism "likely allows a greater number of animals with lives worth living to exist."<ref>Matheny, Gaverick. [http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/matheny.html "Least Harm: A Defense of Vegetarianism from Steven Davis's Omnivorous Proposal"], ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics'', 16(5), 2003, pp. 505–511.</ref> Lamey argued that Davis's calculation of harvest-related deaths was flawed because based on two studies; one included deaths from [[predation]], which he wrote is morally unobjectionable for Regan because not related to human action, and the other examined production of a nonstandard crop (sugarcane), which Lamey wrote has little relevance to deaths associated with typical crop production.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1253172 Lamey 2009], pp. 336, 338.</ref> Lamey also maintained, like Matheny, that accidental deaths are ethically distinct from intentional ones, and that if Davis includes accidental animal deaths in the moral cost of veganism, he must also include the accidental human deaths caused by his proposed diet, which, Lamey wrote, leaves "Davis, rather than Regan, with the less plausible argument."<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1253172 Lamey 2009], p. 344.</ref>
