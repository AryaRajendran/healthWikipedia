'''Stomach cancer''', or '''gastric cancer''', refers to [[cancer]] arising from any part of the [[stomach]]. Stomach cancer causes about 800,000 deaths worldwide per year.<ref name="WHO">{{cite web |title=Cancer (Fact sheet N°297) |publisher =[[World Health Organization]] |month=February |year=2009 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ |accessdate =2009-05-11 }}</ref> Prognosis is poor (5-year survival <5 to 15%) because most patients present with advanced disease.<ref name="Merck-1"/>

==Signs and symptoms==

Stomach cancer is often either [[asymptomatic]] (producing no noticeable symptoms) or it may cause only [[nonspecific symptoms]] (symptoms which are not specific to just stomach cancer, but also to other related or unrelated disorders) in its early stages.  By the time symptoms occur, the cancer has often reached an advanced stage (see below) and may have also metastasized (spread to other, perhaps distant, parts of the body), which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms:

'''Stage 1 (Early)'''
*[[Indigestion]] or a burning sensation ([[heartburn]])
*[[Loss of appetite]], especially for meat
*[[Abdominal pain|Abdominal discomfort]] or irritation

'''Stage 2 (Middle)'''
*[[Weakness]] and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]
*[[Bloating]] of the stomach, usually after meals

'''Stage 3 (Late)'''
*[[Abdominal pain]] in the upper abdomen
*[[Nausea]] and occasional [[vomiting]]
*[[Diarrhea]] or [[constipation]]
*[[Weight loss]]
*[[Bleeding]] ([[vomiting blood]] or having [[blood in the stool]]) which will appear as black.  This can lead to [[anemia]].
*[[Dysphagia]]; this feature suggests a tumor in the [[cardia]] or extension of the gastric tumor in to the [[esophagus]].

Note that these can be symptoms of other problems such as a [[stomach virus]], [[gastric ulcer]] or [[tropical sprue]].

==Causes==
Most stomach cancer is caused by ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection. Dietary factors are not proven causes,<ref name="Merck-1">{{MerckManual|02|021|d||Tumors of the GI Tract}}</ref> but some foods, such as smoked foods, salted fish and meat, and pickled vegetables are associated with a higher risk. Nitrates and nitrites in cured meats can be converted by certain bacteria, including ''H. pylori'', into compounds that have been found to cause stomach cancer in animals. On the other hand, the American Cancer Society recommends eating fresh fruits and vegetables that contain antioxidant vitamins, such as A and C, and says that they lower the risk of stomach cancer,<ref name=ACS_Risk>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/stomachcancer/detailedguide/stomach-cancer-risk-factors|title=What Are The Risk Factors For Stomach Cancer(Website)|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> and a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower rates of stomach cancer.<ref name="American Journal of Clinical Nutrition">{{cite journal | author = Buckland G, Agudo A, Lujan L, Jakszyn P, Bueno-De-Mesquita HB, Palli D, Boeing H, Carneiro F, Krogh V | title = Adherence to a Mediterranean diet and risk of gastric adenocarcinoma within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 381–90 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20007304 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28209 }}</ref>

Smoking increases the risk of developing gastric cancer significantly, from 40% increased risk for current smokers to 82% increase for heavy smokers. Gastric cancers due to smoking mostly occur in the upper part of the stomach near the [[esophagus]]<ref name=ACS_Risk/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Nomura A, Grove JS, Stemmermann GN, Severson RK | title = Cigarette smoking and stomach cancer. | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 50 | issue = 21 | pages = 7084 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2208177 | doi =  | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2208177 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Trédaniel J, Boffetta P, Buiatti E, Saracci R, Hirsch A | title = Tobacco smoking and gastric cancer: Review and meta-analysis | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 565–73 | year = 1997 | month = August | pmid = 9259392 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<565::AID-IJC3>3.0.CO;2-O }}</ref> Some studies show increased risk with alcohol consumption as well.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sung NY, Choi KS, Park EC, Park K, Lee SY, Lee AK, Choi IJ, Jung KW, Won YJ | title = Smoking, alcohol and gastric cancer risk in Korean men: the National Health Insurance Corporation Study | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 97 | issue = 5 | pages = 700–4 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17637680 | pmc = 2360367 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603893 }}</ref>

Other factors associated with increased risk are autoimmune atrophic [[gastritis]], [[intestinal metaplasia]], and genetic factors.

A very small percentage of diffuse-type gastric cancers (see Histopathology below) are thought to be genetic. Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) has recently been identified and research is ongoing. However, genetic testing and treatment options are already available for families at risk.<ref name="pmid15235021">{{cite journal | author = Brooks-Wilson AR, Kaurah P, Suriano G, Leach S, Senz J, Grehan N, Butterfield YS, Jeyes J, Schinas J | title = Germline E-cadherin mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: assessment of 42 new families and review of genetic screening criteria | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 7 | pages = 508–17 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15235021 | pmc = 1735838 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.2004.018275 }}</ref>

The [[International Cancer Genome Consortium]] is leading efforts to map stomach cancer's complete [[genome]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Diagnosis==
To find the cause of symptoms, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history, does a physical exam, and may order laboratory studies. The patient may also have one or all of the following exams:
* [[Gastroscopic exam]] is the diagnostic method of choice. This involves insertion of a [[fiber optic]] camera into the stomach to visualize it.
* [[Upper GI series]] (may be called barium roentgenogram)
* [[Computed tomography]] or CT scanning of the abdomen may reveal gastric cancer, but is more useful to determine invasion into adjacent tissues, or the presence of spread to local lymph nodes.

Abnormal tissue seen in a gastroscope examination will be [[biopsy|biopsied]] by the [[surgery|surgeon]] or [[gastroenterologist]]. This tissue is then sent to a [[pathology|pathologist]] for [[histology|histological]] examination under a microscope to check for the presence of cancerous cells. A biopsy, with subsequent histological analysis, is the only sure way to confirm the presence of cancer cells.

Various gastroscopic modalities have been developed to increase yield of detected mucosa with a dye that accentuates the cell structure and can identify areas of dysplasia. ''Endocytoscopy'' involves ultra-high magnification to visualize cellular structure to better determine areas of dysplasia. Other gastroscopic modalities such as [[optical coherence tomography]] are also being tested investigationally for similar applications.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Inoue H, Kudo S-, Shiokawa A | title = Technology Insight: laser-scanning confocal microscopy and endocytoscopy for cellular observation of the gastrointestinal tract | journal = Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology &#38; Hepatology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16265098 | doi = 10.1038/ncpgasthep0072 }}</ref>

A number of [[cutaneous condition]]s are associated with gastric cancer. A condition of darkened [[hyperplasia]] of the skin, frequently of the [[axilla]] and groin, known as [[acanthosis nigricans]], is associated with intra-abdominal cancers such as gastric cancer. Other cutaneous manifestations of gastric cancer include ''tripe palms'' (a similar darkening hyperplasia of the skin of the palms) and the [[Leser-Trelat sign]], which is the rapid development of skin lesions known as [[seborrheic keratosis|seborrheic keratoses]].<ref name="pmid15230897">{{cite journal | author = Pentenero M, Carrozzo M, Pagano M, Gandolfo S | title = Oral acanthosis nigricans, tripe palms and sign of leser-trelat in a patient with gastric adenocarcinoma | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 43 | issue = 7 | pages = 530–2 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15230897 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.02159.x }}</ref>

Various blood tests may be done, including: Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for anemia. Also, a stool test may be performed to check for blood in the stool.

===Histopathology===

[[File:Gastric signet ring cell carcinoma histopatholgy (1).jpg|right|thumb|Gastric signet ring cell carcinoma. [[H&E stain]].]]

*''Gastric [[adenocarcinoma]]'' is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are overwhelmingly [[adenocarcinomas]] (90%).<ref>{{cite book |last=Kumar |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=8th |page=784 |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5 |ref=harv}}</ref> Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the [[muscularis mucosae]], the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma ("back to back" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. [[Linitis plastica|Diffuse type]] adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically "empty" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus to the periphery: "''[[signet-ring cell]]''".
* Around 5% of gastric malignancies are [[lymphomas]] (MALTomas, or [[MALT lymphoma]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kumar|2010|p=786}}</ref>
* [[Carcinoid]] and stromal tumors may also occur.

===Staging===
If cancer cells are found in the tissue sample, the next step is to [[cancer staging|stage]], or find out the extent of the disease. Various tests determine whether the cancer has spread and, if so, what parts of the body are affected. Because stomach cancer can spread to the liver, the pancreas, and other organs near the stomach as well as to the lungs, the doctor may order a [[CT scan]], a [[PET scan]], an [[endoscopic ultrasound]] exam, or other tests to check these areas.  Blood tests for [[tumor marker]]s, such as [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) may be ordered, as their levels correlate to extent of metastasis, especially to the liver, and the cure rate.

Staging may not be complete until after surgery. The surgeon removes nearby lymph nodes and possibly samples of tissue from other areas in the abdomen for examination by a pathologist.

The clinical stages of stomach cancer are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/cri/content/cri_2_4_4x_treatment_choices_by_type_and_stage_of_stomach_cancer_40.asp|title=Detailed Guide: Stomach Cancer Treatment Choices by Type and Stage of Stomach Cancer|date=2009-11-03|publisher=American Cancer Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ehealthmd.com/library/stomachcancer/STC_stages.html|title=What Are The Stages Of Stomach Cancer?|author=Guy Slowik|date=2009-10|publisher=ehealthmd.com}}</ref>

* '''Stage 0.''' Limited to the inner lining of the stomach.  Treatable by endoscopic mucosal resection when found very early (in routine screenings); otherwise by [[gastrectomy]] and [[lymphadenectomy]] without need for chemotherapy or radiation.
* '''Stage I.''' Penetration to the second or third layers of the stomach '''(Stage 1A)''' or to the second layer and nearby [[lymph nodes]] '''(Stage 1B)'''.  Stage 1A is treated by surgery, including removal of the [[Greater omentum|omentum]].  Stage 1B may be treated with chemotherapy ([[5-fluorouracil]]) and radiation therapy.
* '''Stage II.''' Penetration to the second layer and more distant lymph nodes, or the third layer and only nearby lymph nodes, or all four layers but not the lymph nodes.  Treated as for Stage I, sometimes with additional [[Adjuvant_chemotherapy#Neoadjuvant_therapy|neoadjuvant chemotherapy]].
* '''Stage III.''' Penetration to the third layer and more distant lymph nodes, or penetration to the fourth layer and either nearby tissues or nearby or more distant lymph nodes.  Treated as for Stage II; a cure is still possible in some cases.
* '''Stage IV.''' Cancer has spread to nearby tissues and more distant lymph nodes, or has [[metastatize]]d to other organs.  A cure is very rarely possible at this stage.  Some other techniques to prolong life or improve symptoms are used, including laser treatment, surgery, and/or stents to keep the digestive tract open, and chemotherapy by drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, [[cisplatin]], [[epirubicin]], [[etoposide]], [[docetaxel]], [[oxaliplatin]], [[capecitabine]], or [[irinotecan]].

The [[TNM staging system]] is also used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_3X_How_is_stomach_cancer_staged_40.asp?sitearea=|title=Detailed Guide: Stomach Cancer: How Is Stomach Cancer Staged?|publisher=American Cancer Society}}</ref>

==Management==
Cancer of the stomach is difficult to cure unless it is found in an early stage (before it has begun to spread). Unfortunately, because early stomach cancer causes few symptoms, the disease is usually advanced when the diagnosis is made. Treatment for stomach cancer may include surgery, [[chemotherapy]], and/or [[radiation therapy]]. New treatment approaches such as [[biological therapy]] and improved ways of using current methods are being studied in clinical trials.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 

===Surgery===

Surgery is the most common treatment. The surgeon removes part or all of the stomach, as well as the surrounding [[lymph nodes]], with the basic goal of removing all cancer and a margin of normal tissue.  Depending on the extent of invasion and the location of the tumor, surgery may also include removal of part of the intestine or [[pancreas]].  Tumors in the lower part of the stomach may call for a [[Billroth I]] or [[Billroth II]] procedure.

[[Endoscopic mucosal resection]] (EMR)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Soetikno R, Kaltenbach T, Yeh R, Gotoda T | title = Endoscopic Mucosal Resection for Early Cancers of the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 20 | pages = 4490–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16002839 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.19.935 }}</ref> is a treatment for early gastric cancer (tumor only involves the [[mucosa]]) that has been pioneered in Japan, but is also available in the United States at some centers. In this procedure, the tumor, together with the inner lining of stomach (mucosa), is removed from the wall of the stomach using an electrical wire loop through the endoscope.  The advantage is that it is a much smaller operation than removing the stomach. [[endoscopy|Endoscopic submucosal dissection]] (ESD) is a similar technique pioneered in Japan, used to resect a large area of mucosa in one piece.  If the pathologic examination of the resected specimen shows incomplete resection or deep invasion by tumor, the patient would need a formal stomach resection.

Surgical interventions are currently curative in less than 40% of cases, and, in cases of metastasis, may only be [[Palliative care|palliative]].

===Chemotherapy===

The use of [[chemotherapy]] to treat stomach cancer has no firmly established [[standard of care]]. Unfortunately, stomach cancer has not been particularly sensitive to these drugs, and chemotherapy, if used, has usually served to palliatively reduce the size of the tumor, relieve symptoms of the disease and increase survival time.  Some drugs used in stomach cancer treatment have included: [[5-FU]] (fluorouracil) or its analog capecitabine, BCNU (carmustine), methyl-CCNU (Semustine), and [[doxorubicin]] (Adriamycin), as well as Mitomycin C, and more recently [[cisplatin]] and [[taxotere]], often using drugs in various combinations. The relative benefits of these different drugs, alone and in combination, are unclear.<ref name="pmid17425475">{{cite journal | author = Scartozzi M, Galizia E, Verdecchia L, Berardi R, Antognoli S, Chiorrini S, Cascinu S | title = Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer: across the years for a standard of care | journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 797–808 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17425475 | doi = 10.1517/14656566.8.6.797 }}</ref>  Clinical researchers have explored the benefits of giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells. Combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy has some activity in selected post surgical settings. For patients who have [[HER2]] overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal (GE) junction adenocarcinoma, who have not received prior treatment for their metastatic disease, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval (2010 October) for [[trastuzumab]] (Herceptin, Genentech, Inc.) in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil).  This was based on an improvement of the median overall survival (OS) of 2.5 months<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bang YJ, Van Cutsem E, Feyereislova A, ''et al.'' | title = Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 376 | issue = 9742 | pages = 687–97 | year = 2010 | month = August | pmid = 20728210 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61121-X }}</ref> with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy treatment compared to chemotherapy alone (BO18255 ToGA trial). The combination of Herceptin with chemotherapy for treating metastatic gastric cancer was also sanctioned by the European regulatory authorities (2010 January).

===Radiation===

[[Radiation therapy]] (also called radiotherapy) is the use of high-energy rays to damage cancer cells and stop them from growing.  When used, it is generally in combination with surgery and chemotherapy, or used only with chemotherapy in cases where the individual is unable to undergo surgery. Radiation therapy may be used to relieve pain or blockage by shrinking the tumor for [[palliation]] of incurable disease.

===Multimodality therapy===

While previous studies of multimodality therapy (combinations of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) gave mixed results, the Intergroup 0116 (SWOG 9008) study<ref name="pmid11547741">{{cite journal | author = MacDonald JS, Smalley SR, Benedetti J, Hundahl SA, Estes NC, Stemmermann GN, Haller DG, Ajani JA, Gunderson LL | title = Chemoradiotherapy after Surgery Compared with Surgery Alone for Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach or Gastroesophageal Junction | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 345 | issue = 10 | pages = 725–30 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11547741 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa010187 }}</ref> showed a survival benefit to the combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients with nonmetastatic, completely resected gastric cancer.  Patients were randomized after surgery to the standard group of observation alone, or the study arm of combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Those in the study arm receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy survived on average 36 months; compared to 27 months with observation.

The [[stomach]] is a muscular organ of the [[gastrointestinal]] tract that holds food and begins the digestive process by secreting gastric juice. The most common cancers of the stomach are [[adenocarcinomas]] but other histological types have been reported. Signs vary but may include vomiting (especially if blood is present), weight loss, anemia, and lack of appetite. Bowel movements may be dark and tarry in nature. In order to determine whether cancer is present in the stomach,  special X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasound may be performed. Gastroscopy, a test using an instrument called endoscope to examine the stomach, is a useful diagnostic tool that can also take samples of the suspected mass for histopathological analysis to confirm or rule out cancer. The most definitive method of cancer diagnosis is through open surgical biopsy.<ref name=MacEwan_2001>{{cite book|editor=Withrow SJ, MacEwen EG |title=Small Animal Clinical Oncology|edition=3rd|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company |year=2001}}</ref> Most stomach tumors are malignant with evidence of spread to lymph nodes or liver, making treatment difficult. Except for lymphoma, surgery is the most frequent treatment option for stomach cancers but it is associated with significant risks.
