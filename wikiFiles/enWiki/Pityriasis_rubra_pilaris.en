'''Pityriasis rubra pilaris''' (also known as "Devergie's disease,"<ref name="Bolognia" /> "Lichen ruber acuminatus,"<ref name="Bolognia" /> and "Lichen ruber pilaris"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>) refers to a group of chronic disorders characterized by reddish orange, scaling plaques and keratotic follicular [[papule]]s.<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>{{rp|442}}  Symptoms may include reddish-orange patches (Latin: ''rubra'') on the skin, severe flaking (Latin: ''[[pityriasis]]''), uncomfortable itching, thickening of the skin on the feet and hands, and thickened bumps around [[hair follicle]]s (Latin: ''pilus'' for hair). For some, early symptoms may also include generalized swelling of the legs, feet and other parts of the body. PRP has a varied clinical progression and a varied rate of improvement.  There is no known cause or cure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

It was first described by [[Marie-Guillaume-Alphonse Devergie]] in 1856,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Devergie M. G. A. |title=[Pityriasis pilaris, a skin disease not described by  dermatologists] (Pityriasis pilaris, maladie de la peau non décrite par les dermatologistes). |language=French |journal=Gazette hebdomadaire de médecine et de chirurgie, Paris |year=1856 |volume=3|pages=197–201}}</ref> and the condition is also known as Devergie's disease.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt2|doctor|963|M.

==Classification==
Dr. W.A.D. Griffiths, from [[Great Britain]], classified six forms of PRP in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pityriasis rubra pilaris |url=http://dermnetnz.org/scaly/pityriasis-rubra-pilaris.html |publisher=DermNZ (New Zealand Dermatological Society) |date=26 December 2006 |accessdate=2007-05-08}} - describes the various forms</ref>  At this time, the causes of PRP are still unknown and symptoms can be difficult to diagnose.  Frequently, more than one medical professional will be consulted before an accurate PRP diagnosis is made.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Dermatologists have identified both an acquired form and an [[Genetic disorder|inherited form]] (familial) of PRP and have described them in medical journals.  The acquired form usually shows a spontaneous or gradual remission of symptoms within several years although long-term symptoms may continue for years.  The inherited form starts early in childhood with persistent long-term symptoms into adulthood.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Although most people who develop PRP are over age 50, individuals of any age, race, and nationality can be affected.  Women and men seem to be equally affected.<ref>{{cite article |author=Allison DS, El-Azhary RA, Calobrisi SD, Dicken CH |title=Pityriasis rubra pilaris in children |publisher=Journal of the American Academy Dermatology |year=2002}}</ref>
