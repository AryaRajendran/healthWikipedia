He became a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1809, and was afterwards in practice at [[Helston]] in Cornwall for the long period of sixty-nine years. A considerable portion of his practice consisted in attending the men accidentally injured in the [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|tin and copper mines of his neighbourhood]], and his attention was thus led to mining.<ref name="dnb" />

From 1841 to 1879 he kept meteorological records for the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]].<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web | last = Crook | first =Denise | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Moyle, Matthew Paul (1788â€“1880) | work = [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | publisher =Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19471 | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-11-22}}</ref>

He died at Cross Street, Helston, on 7 August 1880, leaving a large family.<ref name="dnb" />

==Writings==
In 1814 he sent to [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]'s ''[[Annals of Philosophy]]'' "Queries respecting the flow of Water in Chacewater Mine"; in the following years he communicated papers on "The Temperature of Mines", "On Granite Veins", and "On the Atmosphere of Cornish Mines".<ref name="dnb" />

In 1822 he read a paper on the raised temperatures in mines to the [[Royal Geological Society of Cornwall]].<ref name=ODNB/>

During a series of years he kept registers and made extensive and valuable observations on barometers and thermometers, and in conjunction with [[Robert Were Fox the Younger|Robert Were Fox]] he wrote and communicated to [[Alexander Tilloch]]'s ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' in 1823, "An Account of the Observations and Experiments on the Temperature of Mines which have recently been made in Cornwall and the North of England". In 1841 he sent to [[William Sturgeon|Sturgeon's]] ''Annals of Electricity'' a paper "On the Formation of Electro-type Plates independently of any engraving", which concerned the then-new process of [[electrotyping]].<ref name="dnb" />
