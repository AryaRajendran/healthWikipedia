The '''plantar reflex''' is a [[reflex]] elicited when the sole of the foot is stimulated with a blunt instrument.  The reflex can take one of two forms.  In normal adults the plantar reflex causes a downward response of the [[hallux]] ([[flexion]]). An upward response ([[Extension_(kinesiology)|extension]]) of the [[hallux]] is known as '''Koch sign''', '''Babinski response''' or '''Babinski sign''', named after [[Joseph Babinski]] (1857–1932), a [[France|French]]<ref>Brear, Connors and Paradiso. ''Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain'', Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2007, p. 456.</ref> [[neurology|neurologist]] of [[Poland|Polish]] origin. The presence of the Babinski sign can identify [[disease]] of the [[spinal cord]] and [[Human brain|brain]] in adults, and also exists as a [[Primitive reflexes|primitive reflex]] in [[infant]]s.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|366}}</ref><ref>''Comptes rendus de la Société de Biologie'', Vol. 48, 1896, p. 207.</ref>

==Methods==
[[File:BabinskiSign.jpg|thumb|240px|Pathological Babinski's sign in adult]]

The [[Human_anatomical_terms#Near_or_away_from_the_vertical_longitudinal_center_of_the_body|lateral]] side of the [[sole (foot)|sole of the foot]] is rubbed with a blunt instrument or device so as not to cause pain, discomfort, or injury to the skin; the instrument is run from the heel along a curve to the [[toe]]s<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000091594|plantar reflex}}</ref> ([[metatarsus|metatarsal]] pads). Many [[reflex hammer]]s taper at the end of the handle to a point which was used for testing the plantar response in the past, however, due to the tightening of [[infection control]] regulation this is no longer recommended. Either a single use orange stick or the thumb nail should be used.

There are three responses possible:
* Flexor: the toes curve down and inwards, and the foot [[Eversion (kinesiology)|everts]]; this is the response seen in healthy adults.
* Indifferent: there is no response.
* Extensor: the [[hallux]] [[dorsiflexion|dorsiflexes]], and the other toes fan out; this is Babinski's sign, which indicates damage to the [[central nervous system]].

As the [[lesion]] responsible for the sign expands, so does the area from which the [[Afferent nerve|afferent]] Babinski response may be elicited. The Babinski response is also normal while asleep and after a long period of walking.

==Interpretation==
[[File:Babinski-newborn.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Babinski's Sign in a healthy newborn]]

The Babinski sign can indicate [[upper motor neuron]] lesion constituting damage to the [[corticospinal tract]]. Occasionally, a pathological plantar reflex  is the first (and only) indication of a serious disease process and a clearly abnormal plantar reflex often prompts detailed [[neurology|neurological]] investigations, including [[Computed tomography|CT scanning]] of the brain or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the spine, as well as [[lumbar puncture]] for the study of [[cerebrospinal fluid]].

Babinski sign is an up-turning or extensor plantar response. Modifiers "upgoing, "downgoing, "positive," or "negative" should not be applied. The phrase "negative Babinski sign" is a [[misnomer]] for a "flexor plantar response."''<ref>{{cite book|last=Larner|first=A.J.|title=A dictionary of neurological signs|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9750387262147 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} {{Please check ISBN|reason=13 digit ISBN should start with  978 or 979.}}|pages=50|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=lmk6vxPeE7sC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=incorrectly+referred+to+as+negative+babinski&source=bl&ots=4Z7zAxZxiT&sig=lJNIhgbtsN6dQ408sd6KewbT6H8&hl=en&ei=KseTTcDxEoeycd3bsasH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> 

===In infants===
{{main|Primitive reflexes}}
[[Infant]]s will also show an extensor response. A baby's smaller toes will fan out and his big toe will [[dorsiflexion|dorsiflex]] slowly. This happens because the [[corticospinal tract|corticospinal pathways]] that run from the [[Human brain|brain]] down the [[spinal cord]] are not fully [[myelin]]ated at this age, so the reflex is not inhibited by the [[cerebral cortex]]. The extensor response disappears and gives way to the flexor response around 12 to 24 months of age.

===Pathways===
Afferent: Nociception detected in the S1 dermatome and travels up the tibial nerve to the sciatic nerve to roots of L5,S1 and synapse in the anterior horn to elicit the motor response. 
Efferent: Motor response back through the L5,S1 roots to the sciatic nerve to its bifurcation.  Toe flexors are innervated by tibial nerve. Toe extensors (extensor hallicus longus, extensor digitorum longus) are innervated by the deep peroneal nerve. Loss of normal adult descending pyramidal control of the reflex arc to suppress extensor withdrawal results in the upgoing toes in the plantar reflex known as Babinski's sign. There is no such thing as a negative Babinski's sign.

==Relationship to Hoffmann reflex==
{{main|Hoffmann's reflex}}
The [[Hoffmann's reflex]] is sometimes described as the [[upper limb]] equivalent of the Babinski sign<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harrop JS, Hanna A, Silva MT, Sharan A |title=Neurological manifestations of cervical spondylosis: an overview of signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=60 |issue=1 Supp1 1 |pages=S14–20 |year=2007 |pmid=17204875 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000215380.71097.EC}}</ref> because both indicate [[upper motor neuron]] dysfunction. Mechanistically, they differ significantly; the finger flexor reflex is a simple [[Reflex arc|monosynaptic spinal reflex]] involving the [[flexor digitorum profundus muscle|flexor digitorum profundus]] that is normally fully inhibited by upper motor neurons. The pathway producing the plantar response is more complicated, and is not monosynaptic.  This difference has led some{{Who|date=October 2007}} neurologists to reject strongly any analogies between the finger flexor reflex and the plantar response.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

== Babinski-like responses ==
The plantar reflex can be elicited in a number of ways, which were described in the late 19th and early 20th century. These have their own eponyms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kumar SP, Ramasubramanian D |title=The Babinski sign--a reappraisal |journal=Neurol India |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=314–8 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11146592 |doi= |url=http://www.neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2000;volume=48;issue=4;spage=314;epage=8;aulast=Kumar |accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref>
