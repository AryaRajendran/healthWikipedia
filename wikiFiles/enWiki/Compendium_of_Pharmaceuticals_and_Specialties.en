The '''''Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties: The Canadian Drug Reference for Health Professionals''''', more commonly known by its [[abbreviation]] ''CPS'',<ref name=repchinsky>Repchinsky C. The CPS: Love, hate and expectations. Can. J Clin. Pharm. 2002. 9(2). Available at: [http://www.pulsus.com/clin-pha/09_02/repc_ed.htm http://www.pulsus.com/clin-pha/09_02/repc_ed.htm]</ref>  is a reference book that contains drug monographs and numerous features which help healthcare professionals prescribe and use drugs safely and appropriately. A print version of ''CPS'' is released annually by the Canadian Pharmacists Association (CPhA). The CPhA is a nonprofit organization that advocates for pharmacists in Canada. An external Editorial Advisory Committee of Canadian physicians and pharmacists advises CPhA about the strategic direction of their publications including ''CPS''. ''CPS'' is also available online to subscribers at www.e-therapeutics.ca.  Most of the drug monographs in ''CPS'' are provided by manufacturers, though numerous monographs—usually for drugs which are available as generic brands— are written by CPhA editorial staff. 2010 marks the 50th anniversary of the first edition of ''CPS''.

== CPS Content ==
The following sections appear in ''CPS''.

=== Brand and Generic Name Index ===

The Brand and Generic Name Index is located at the front of ''CPS''. It is the most comprehensive list of current brand and generic drugs in Canada, and also includes discontinued products. This section is also referred to as the green section because of the green border on the right side of the pages.

=== Therapeutic Guide ===

The Therapeutic Guide is located near the front of ''CPS''. These pages offer uses or indications and the drugs available to treat that indication. The Therapeutic Guide is also referred to as the pink section because of the pink border on the right side of the pages.

=== Product Identification ===

The Product Identification section includes photos and illustrations of numerous drugs in pill, tablet, caplet, capsule, syrup, and other forms. These illustrations and professional photos are included if manufacturers wish to participate in this service.

=== Clin-Info ===

The Clin-Info section is located at the front of ''CPS''. Clin-Info provides clinically useful equations, principles of prescribing in pregnancy, drug and food administration, immunization schedules, and other quick reference information for healthcare professionals to safely and effectively use drugs. The Clin-Info section is also referred to as the lilac section because of the lilac border on the right side of the pages.

=== Directory ===

The Directory includes contact information for poison control centres, health organizations, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

=== Monographs ===

There are two types of monographs that appear in ''CPS''.

==== Product Monographs ====

The bulk of ''CPS'' consists of monographs that are provided by pharmaceutical  manufacturers. These monographs are written and owned by the manufacturers and are approved by Health Canada. CPhA formats the monographs for publication but does not change the content of these monographs in any way. The section of the book that contains monographs is also referred to as the white section because of the lack of any coloured border on the right side of the pages. Monographs appear alphabetically by brand name.

==== CPhA Monographs ====

Amongst the manufacturer-supplied monographs in ''CPS'' are numerous monographs—140 in 2010— compiled by editorial staff at CPhA.  These CPhA monographs are peer reviewed by Canadian experts, provide the best available evidence and  accumulated clinical information about the drug or drug class. In addition, each CPhA monograph contains a section on pregnancy and breastfeeding. CPhA monographs are indexed at the front of ''CPS'' and easily identified—the titles are shaded in grey— throughout ''CPS''.

=== Information for the Patient ===

Information for the Patient provides helpful advice and how-to information for patients on many drugs. This is Part III of the Health Canada approved product monograph and reflects the content of Part I, but is written in lay language that is easier for patients to understand.  This section is only available in e-CPS.

=== Drug Updates ===

Drug updates  about new molecular entities, new products, new indications, and new safety information are published in e-CPS and are also available at www.pharmacists.ca under the “products” tab. All updates appear in the subsequent print edition of ''CPS''.

=== Appendices ===

The Appendices contain Health Canada drug regulatory and monitoring programs’ reporting and request forms on such topics as Narcotic and Controlled Drugs, Benzodiazepines and Other Targeted Substances, and Adverse Events Following Immunization: Surveillance and Reporting.

=== Glossaries ===

A number of helpful glossaries appear near the end of ''CPS'' including Medical Abbreviations, and Latin Prescription Terms.

== Other Information about ''CPS'' ==
The following sections include other information about ''CPS''.

=== e-CPS ===

All the information that appears in the ''CPS'' print edition is also available to subscribers at www.e-therapeutics.ca. The information in e-CPS is updated once every two weeks or more frequently depending on the urgency of the information. Health Canada alerts are also added to the drug monographs in e-CPS when they are issued.

=== Physical Description ===

The print version of ''CPS'' has a blue cover and perfect binding.  The page size is 10 X 12” and the font size is 6.5. The 2010 English edition contains 3036 pages, and the French edition contains 3384 pages.

=== Release Date ===

The English version of ''CPS'' is released in January every year, and the French version is released in February every year.

=== History ===

2010 marked the 50th anniversary of the first publication of ''CPS'' (although not the 50th edition—there were some years in which ''CPS'' was not published). ''CPS'' has been published annually since 1967. There have been numerous changes and additions to ''CPS'' over the years including the first French edition in 1968, a move from hard-cover to soft-cover in 1981, and the introduction of e-CPS in 2004. With each passing year there are more drug monographs and information in ''CPS'', which has resulted in a steadily increasing volume size. Sales have continued to grow as ''CPS'' remains the most comprehensive and frequently used reference for safely and accurately prescribing drugs in Canada.

== Criticisms ==
In the past, the CPS has been criticized for being heavily influenced by the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and for lacking important information, such as [[efficacy]] and [[price]].<ref name=bell>{{cite journal |author=Bell RW, Osterman JW |title=The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties: a critical analysis |journal=International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=107–18 |year=1983 |pmid=6832868 |doi=}}</ref>

Some have called for the creation of an independent, [[nonprofit]] organization to manage the CPS.<ref name=bell/>
