'''Coprophagia''' {{IPA-en|kɒp.rə.ˈfeɪ.dʒi.ə||}}<ref>''Coprophagia.'' (2012). Dictionary.com September 2, 2012, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprophagia link]</ref> or coprophagy is the consumption of [[feces]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος ''copros'', "feces" and φαγεῖν ''phagein'', "to eat".  Many [[animal]] [[species]] practice coprophagia as a matter of course; other species do not normally consume feces but may do so under unusual conditions. Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces eating including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics),of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or its own (autocoprophagy), those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].<ref>Hirakawa, H. 2001. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mam/2001/00000031/00000001/art00005 " Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores"] Mammal Review, Volume 31, Number 1, pp. 61-80(20)</ref>

==In plants and animals==

Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus ''[[Nepenthes]]'', obtain nourishment from the feces of [[commensalism|commensal]] animals.

Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested [[food]] ([[herbivore]]s' [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive systems]] are especially inefficient).  The most notable feces-eating insect is the [[dung-beetle]] and the most common is the [[fly]].

[[Termite]]s eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their [[hindgut]] [[protist]]s. Termites and protists have a [[symbiotic]] relationship that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet via the protists. It has also been proposed that hormones are passed to offspring in this way.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Pig]]s, like the above insects, will eat the feces of herbivores that leave a significant amount of semi-digested matter, including their own. In certain cultures it was common for poor families to collect horse feces to feed their pigs. However, allowing domestic pigs to consume feces contributes to the risk of parasite infection.  The [[pig toilet]] is an ancient method of feeding pigs on garbage and human [[feces]], and is used in [[China]].

[[Cattle]] in the United States are often fed [[chicken litter]] due to the high amount of protein and low cost of the feed versus other sources of protein. It has been reported that this process is made safe in regards to bacteria loading by heating the chicken litter to {{convert|160|F|C}} prior to consumption. There are, however, concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed [[meat and bone meal|bone meal]] in chicken feed. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into [[livestock]] feed.<ref>[http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/18835/fda-urged-to-ban-feeding-chicken-litter-to-cattle FDA Urged to Ban Feeding Chicken Litter to Cattle], 2009-11-02, L.A. Times</ref> Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.

[[Capybara]], [[rabbit]]s, [[hamster]]s and other related species do not have a complex [[ruminant]] digestive system. Instead they  are [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]] that digest cellulose via microbial fermentation.  In addition, they extract further nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]]. Soft [[fecal pellet]]s of partially digested food are [[excretion|excreted]] and generally consumed immediately. Consuming these [[cecotrope]]s is important for adequate nutritional intake of [[vitamin B12]].  They also produce normal [[feces|droppings]], which are not eaten.

Young [[elephant]]s, [[Giant Panda|pandas]], [[koala]]s, and [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd to obtain the [[bacteria]] required to properly digest [[vegetation]] found on the [[savanna]] and in the [[jungle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature&nbsp;— Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref> When they are born, their [[intestine]]s do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile).  Without them, they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.

[[Gorillas]] eat their own feces and the feces of other gorillas. Similar behavior has also been observed among [[chimpanzees]].  Such behavior may serve to improve absorption of vitamins or of nutritive elements made available from the re-ingestion of seeds.

Hamsters, [[guinea pigs]] and [[chinchillas]] eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin K|K]], produced by bacteria in the gut. [[Ape]]s have been observed eating [[horse]] feces for the [[salt]] content. [[Monkey]]s have been observed eating elephant feces. Coprophagia also has been observed in the [[naked mole rat]].

[[Cat]] mothers are known to eat the feces of their newborn [[kitten]]s during the very earliest phase after birth, presumably to eliminate cues to potential predators and to keep the den clean.

Both domesticated and wild mammals are known to consume feces. In the wild they either bury or eat waste to protect their trail from predators. In species of cats, the dominant feline openly displays feces. In domesticated mammals, choosing not to offend the dominant owner, they eat or more prominently bury waste.

===Medical aspects===

[[Fecal bacteriotherapy]] is when feces from a close relative or spouse are given to patients suffering from intractable [[diarrhea]] caused by ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''. The purpose is to repopulate the intestines with the normal [[gut flora]] (intestinal [[bacteria]]) to decimate the clostridium. The healthy stool is administered by [[nasogastric tube]], [[enema]], or in a [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]].

Consuming other [[human feces|people's feces]] carries the risk of contracting diseases and bacteria spread through fecal matter, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis E]], [[pneumonia]], [[polio]], and [[influenza]]. Coprophagia also carries a risk of contracting [[intestinal parasite]]s.

Lewin (2001) reports that "... consumption of fresh, warm [[camel]] feces has been recommended by [[Bedouin]]s as a remedy for bacterial [[dysentery]]; its efficacy (probably attributable to the [[antibiotic]] [[subtilisin]] from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'') was confirmed by [[Afrika Korps|German soldiers]] in [[Africa]] during [[World War II]]".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on Merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 }}.

From the psychiatry literature, coprophagia has been observed in a small number of patients with [[schizophrenia]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harada KI, Yamamoto K, Saito T.| title = Effective treatment of coprophagia in a patient with schizophrenia with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug perospirone | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | year = 2006 | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | page = 113 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-941487  | pmid = 16721701 }}</ref> [[Major depressive disorder|depression]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wise, T.N., and R.L.

Centuries ago, [[physicians]] used to taste their patients' [[excretion]]s, to better judge their state and condition.<ref>notes to ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=qsv_Y0DOVUsC The Works of Francis Rabelais, Volume II, Volume 2]'', p. 56</ref>

===Sexual aspects===

Some [[Coprophilia|coprophiles]] engage in this practice. Until 1995, the only documented cases of coprophagia were in those who were either schizophrenic or mentally retarded, but it has now been shown to occur among mentally healthy individuals as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wise TN, Goldberg RL |title=Escalation of a Fetish: Coprophagia in a Nonpsychotic Adult of Normal Intelligence |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=272–75 |year=1995 |doi=10.1080/00926239508414647 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926239508414647}}</ref> Psychiatrists using the classification system of the [[DSM-IV]] would consider this a symptom of the [[paraphilia]] called [[coprophilia]] "if the behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning". Coprophagia is also depicted in [[pornography]], usually under the term ''scat'' (from ''[[scatology]]'').<ref name="Holmes">{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |pages= ''p''. 244}}</ref>

===In literature===

* ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a novel by the [[Marquis de Sade]] written in 1785, is replete with detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.<ref>le Marquis de Sade (1785) Les 120 journées de Sodome, ou L'École du Libertinage</ref>

* [[François Rabelais]], in his classic ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', often employs the expression ''mâche-merde'' or ''mâchemerde'', meaning ''shit-chewer''. It is in turn a citation of the Greek comedians [[Aristophanes]] and particularly [[Menander]], which often use the term skatophagos (''σκατοϕάγος'').<ref>Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 and Book 3 chap. 25</ref> In one dialogue, Rabelais speaks of coprophagia as a [[Christian]] gesture, saying that monks ''swallow the shit of the world, that is the sins'', and for this they are ostracized by society.<ref>Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 quote: "ilz mangent la merde du monde, c'est à dire, les pechez"</ref>
* ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'', a novel by [[Iain M Banks]], contains depictions of a tribe known as the Eaters, who repeatedly engage in coprophagia.
* ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', a comic-absurdist play by [[Alfred Jarry]], contains numerous references to coprophagy/[[scatology]].<ref>Ubu Roi</ref>

===In film===

* The third amongst the four acts of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1975 film ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a loose adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's aforementioned ''The 120 Days of Sodom'', is concerned with coprophagia.

* ''[[The Green Elephant]]''; during a [[psychotic break]], one prisoner consumes his own feces.
* ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]''; a [[mad scientist]] captures three tourists and surgically connects them mouth to anus, so that two of them are "fed" by the bowel movements of the "segment" whose buttocks their mouth has been attached to.
* ''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)]]''; in the sequel to the above, a man copycats the scientist's experiment, but with nearly a dozen victims.
* ''[[Unspeakable (2000 film)|Unspeakable]]''; when a catatonic woman defecates, a man smears it on her vagina, then performs [[cunnilingus]] on her.

===In TV series===

* ''[[Tsst]]''; in a seventh episode of the tenth season of ''[[South Park]]'', the American animated [[TV series]], a nanny [[Jo Frost]] from the [[reality TV]] program ''[[Supernanny]]'', ends up in a [[psychiatric hospital]] eating her own feces after her attempt to help [[Cartman]]'s mom with his son's behavior problems.
* ''[[HumancentiPad]]''; in the first episode of the fifteenth season of ''South Park'', [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is kidnapped and forced to become part of a "revolutionary new product" for which he and the other two were kidnapped people form the "HUMANCENTiPAD", comprising the three kidnapped subjects on all fours and sewn together mouth to anus (the [[Subplot|story-line]] is based on ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|The Human Centipede]]'').
