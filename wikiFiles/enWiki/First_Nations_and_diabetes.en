There are high rates of '''diabetes in First Nation''' people compared to the general Canadian population. Statistics from 2011 showed that 17.2% of First Nations people living on reserves had Type 2 Diabetes.<ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca">Population Health Agency Canada PHAC (2011).

Contributing factors to the high prevalence of [[Type 2 diabetes|Type 2 Diabetes]] between First Nation and the general population include a combination of environmental (lifestyle, diet, poverty), and genetic and biological factors (e.g. [[Thrifty gene hypothesis|thrifty genotype hypothesis]], [[thrifty phenotype]]).<ref>Pollard, T.

==Diabetes mellitus Type 2==
	 		 	
Rates of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in First Nation communities were non-existent 20 years ago, but increased steeply.<ref>Shubair, MM, & Tobin, PK (2010) Type 2 diabetes in the First Nations population: a case example of clinical practice guidelines. Rural and Remote Health; 10, 1505 - 1511.</ref> Age-standardized rates of T2D show 17.2% prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes among First Nations individuals living on reserves, compared to 5.0% in the non-Aboriginal population;<ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca">Population Health Agency Canada PHAC (2011).

Statistics indicate that the Type 2 Diabetes prevalence rate in First Nations people is 3 to 5 times higher than the general Canadian population.<ref>Ontario Aboriginal Diabetes Strategy from the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (2011) Retrieved February 6, 2012: www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/ministry_reports/oads_06/oads_06.pdf</ref> As well as having a higher rate of Type 2 Diabetes than the general population, there are also differences in the disease pattern in First Nations Type 2 Diabetes sufferers compared to the general population, especially in terms of age of onset and gestational diabetes.<ref>Sellers, E, Moore, K, Dean, H (2009) Clinical Management of type 2 diabetes in indigenous youth. In Pedriatric Clinic of North America 56: 1141-1459.</ref>
	 
===Diabetes in youth===
	
Diabetes in first nations has increasingly become a disease of the younger population, who thus experience a high burden of disease, diabetes-related complications and co-morbidity. To illustrate, in the general population Type 2 Diabetes is an old-age associated disease: New diabetes cases peaked in First Nations people between ages 40–49 compared with a non-First Nations peak of age 70+.<ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/> 

This earlier onset of disease in First Nation population has serious health implications for the women, especially during her reproductive life-years: it increases the chance of her children to develop diabetes, contributing to diabetes [[prevalence]] and [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] in the future generations.
	 	
===Diabetes in women===

First Nations women in particular suffer from diabetes, especially between ages 20–49. They have a 4 times higher incidence of diabetes than non-first nation women<ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/> as well as experiencing higher rates of gestational diabetes than non-Aboriginal females, 8-18% compared to 2-4%.<ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"/> 

==== Gestational diabetes ====
A third type of diabetes, other than [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2]] is gestational diabetes mellitus. This is a temporary type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy. Most women with [[gestational diabetes]] will return to normal glucose levels after delivery of the baby; if a woman does not return to normal glucose levels she will be re-diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and is no longer considered to have gestational diabetes.<ref name="naho.ca">First Nations Centre, National Aboriginal Health Organization, (2009). Gestational Diabetes and First Nations Women: A literature review. Retrieved from http://www.naho.ca/documents/fnc/english/gestational_diabetes_first_nations_women.pdf</ref> 

Gestational diabetes carries risks for both the mother and the baby. It increases the likelihood of the infant developing T2D, and giving birth to high body-weight baby. High body-weight increases risk of the child developing diabetes even if mother does not have it.<ref name="naho.ca"/>

==Screening programs for First Nations==

The Review of Guidelines for Screening and Treatment affirms the use of [[glucose test|fasting plasma glucose test]] (FPG) or a 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) as a screening tool.<ref name="Health 2010">Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH-HTIS). (2010b). Diabetes in Aboriginal Populations: Review of Guidelines for Screening and Treatment. Prepared by Health Technology Inquiry Service (HTIS). August 2010.</ref> Due to the higher incidence of diabetes in Aboriginals, more frequent screening is recommended to improve diabetes management and prevention strategies. Instead of a standard screening every third year, aboriginal adults in Canada with a higher risk of developing diabetes are called upon to be screened every one or two years.<ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/>

Children above the age of ten identified as at high risk for developing diabetes are recommended for screening, especially important in First Nations and Aboriginal populations, as the age of onset of diabetes is lower (happening in at earlier age) compared to the general population.<ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/> Obese children ([[Body mass index|BMI]] > 99.5) should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test each year.<ref>Ur, Ehud; Chiasson, Jean-Louis; Ransom, Tom; Rowe, Richard (2008) Screening for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. In Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee (ed.) 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines.</ref> Even though a range of different screening programs for Aboriginals exist, there is a need for screening programs in partnership with communities.<ref name="Health 2010"/>

==Current policies for diabetes in First Nations==
	
The Government of Canada has policies and programs in place aimed at improving the health of Aboriginal people. One such measure was the implementation of the [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/diseases-maladies/diabete/index-eng.php Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative] (ADI) in 1999. The ADI has been funded continuously over three phases: Phase 1 (1999–2004); Phase 2 (2005–2010), and; Phase 3 (2011–2015). 

The goal of ADI is to reduce the prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes through [[health promotion]] campaigns and initiatives implemented by trained community diabetes workers and health professionals. The ADI has four main components from which the program expects to achieve its objectives.	
# Community-based health promotion and primary prevention	
# Screening and management activities in order to diagnose disease early
# Capacity building and training activities to equip community health workers and health professional	
# Knowledge mobilization activities to enhance sharing of knowledge
The current Phase 3 includes healthy living initiatives for children, youth, parents, and families; diabetes in pre-pregnancy and pregnancy; community-led food security planning; and enhanced training for health professionals on clinical practice guidelines and chronic disease management strategies.<ref>Health Canada (HC) (2011).
