}}</ref> The modern scientific field has its origins in the works by Florentine scientists in the 17th century. Early devices to measure temperature were called [[thermoscope]]s. The first sealed thermometer was constructed in 1641 by the Grand Duke of Toscani, Ferdinand II.<ref name=quinn/> The development of today's [[thermometer]]s and [[temperature]] scales began in the early 18th century, when [[Gabriel Fahrenheit]] adapted a thermometer using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and a scale both developed by [[Ole Rømer|Ole Christensen Rømer]]. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use, alongside the [[Celsius]] scale and the [[Kelvin]] scale.

== Technologies ==
Many methods have been developed for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the [[mercury-in-glass thermometer|glass thermometer]]. This consists of a glass tube filled with [[mercury (element) | mercury]] or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the [[gas thermometer]].

Other important devices for measuring temperature include:
* [[Thermocouple]]s
* [[Thermistor]]s
* [[Resistance Temperature Detector]] (RTD)
* [[Pyrometer]]
* [[Langmuir probe]]s (for electron temperature of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]])
* [[Infrared]]
* Other [[thermometer]]s

One must be careful when measuring temperature to ensure that the measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the [[wind chill factor]], where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.

The theoretical basis for thermometers is the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] which postulates that if you have three bodies, A, B and C, if A and B are at the same temperature, and B and C are at the same temperature then A and C are at the same temperature.  B, of course, is the thermometer.

The practical basis of thermometry is the existence of [[triple point]] cells.  Triple points are conditions of pressure, volume and temperature such that three [[phase (matter)|phase]]s are simultaneously present, for example solid, vapor and liquid.  For a single component there are no degrees of freedom at a triple point and any change in the three variables results in one or more of the phases vanishing from the cell.  Therefore, triple point cells can be used as universal references for temperature and pressure. (See [[Gibb's phase rule]])    

Under some conditions it becomes possible to measure temperature by a direct use of the [[Planck's law of black body radiation]]. For example, the [[cosmic microwave background]] temperature has been measured from the spectrum of photons observed by satellite observations such as the [[WMAP]]. In the study of the [[quark-gluon plasma]] through  [[quark-gluon plasma#How is this created in the lab?|heavy-ion collisions]], [[single particle spectra]] sometimes serve as a thermometer.

== Surface air temperature ==
Meteorological observatories measure the temperature and humidity of the air near the surface of the Earth usually using thermometers placed in a [[Stevenson screen]], a standardized well-ventilated white-painted instrument shelter. The thermometers should be positioned 1.25–2 m above the ground. Important note.<ref>[http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/abs_temp.html GISS Surface Temperature Analysis: The Elusive Absolute Surface Air Temperature (SAT)] Quote: "...Q. What exactly do we mean by SAT ? A. I doubt that there is a general agreement how to answer this question...Q. If SATs cannot be measured, how are SAT maps created ? A. This can only be done with the help of computer models..."</ref> Details of this setup are defined by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO).

The true daily mean, obtained from a thermograph, is approximated by the mean of 24 hourly readings (which is not the same as the mean of the daily minimum and maximum readings).<ref>[http://eobglossary.gsfc.nasa.gov/Library/glossary.php3?mode=alpha&seg=s]</ref>

The world's average surface air temperature is about 15&nbsp;°C. For information on temperature changes relevant to [[climate change]] or [[Earth]]'s [[geology|geologic]] past see: [[Temperature record]].
