Even though [[zinc]] is an essential requirement for a healthy body, excess zinc can be harmful, and cause '''zinc toxicity'''.<ref name="pmid2407097">{{cite journal |author=Fosmire GJ |title=Zinc toxicity |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=225–7 |year=1990 |month=February |pmid=2407097 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2407097}}</ref> Excessive absorption of zinc can suppress copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model (FIAM) is well-established in the literature, and shows that just [[mole (unit)|micromolar]] amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all ''[[Daphnia]]'' in water.<ref>{{cite journal  | title =  Mechanisms of chronic waterborne Zn toxicity in Daphnia magna | first  = Brita, T.

The free zinc ion is also a powerful [[Lewis acid]] up to the point of being [[corrosive]]. Stomach acid contains [[hydrochloric acid]], in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive [[zinc chloride]]. Swallowing a post-1982 American one [[Cent (United States coin)|cent]] piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining due to the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.<ref>{{cite journal  | title = Chronic Ingestion of a Zinc-Based Penny  | first  = Dawn N. | last = Bothwell   | coauthors =  Mair, Eric A.;  Cable, Benjamin B. | journal = Pediatrics  | volume = 111  | issue = 3 | pages = 689&ndash;691 | year =  2003 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/111/3/689 | doi = 10.1542/peds.111.3.689  | pmid = 12612262}}</ref> 

There is evidence of induced [[copper deficiency]] at low intakes of 100&ndash;300&nbsp;mg Zn/d. The [[USDA]] [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] is 15&nbsp;mg Zn/d. Even lower levels, closer to the RDA, may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or to adversely affect cholesterol.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 51 | pages = 225&ndash;227 | date=1 February 1990| title = Zinc toxicity | first = G.

There is also a condition called the "zinc shakes" or "zinc chills" or [[metal fume fever]] that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed [[zinc oxide]] formed during the [[welding]] of [[galvanize]]d materials.<ref name="CRCp4-41">{{harvnb|CRC|2006|pp=4–41}}<!-- sic "-" not a range! --></ref>
