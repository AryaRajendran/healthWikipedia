'''Acute lymphoblastic leukemia''' ('''ALL''') is a form of [[leukemia]], or [[hematological malignancy|cancer of the white blood cells]] characterized by excess [[lymphoblast]]s.

[[Malignant]], immature [[lymphoblasts|white blood cells]] continuously multiply and are overproduced in the [[bone marrow]]. ALL causes damage and death by crowding out normal cells in the bone marrow, and by spreading ([[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrating]]) to other organs. ALL is most common in childhood with a peak incidence at 2–5 years of age, and another peak in old age. 

Cure is a realistic goal. ≥94% of children have continuous disease-free survival for 5 years and appear cured. 30-40% of adults have continuous disease-free survival for 5 years.

Malignancies of Lymphoid Cells. Clinical Features, Treatment, and Prognosis of Specific Lymphoid Malignancies.</ref> 

''Acute'' refers to the relatively short time course of the disease (being fatal in as little as a few weeks if left untreated) to differentiate it from the very different disease of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], which has a potential time course of many years. It is interchangeably referred to as Lymphocytic or Lymphoblastic. This refers to the cells that are involved, which if they were normal would be referred to as [[lymphocytes]] but are seen in this disease in a relatively immature (also termed '[[Precursor cell|blast]]') state.

== Diagnosis ==
[[medical diagnosis|Diagnosing]] ALL begins with a medical history, [[physical examination]], [[Full blood count|complete blood count]], and blood smears. Because the symptoms are so general, many other diseases with similar symptoms must be excluded. Typically, the higher the white blood cell count the worse the prognosis.<ref>{{cite book

Malignancies of Lymphoid Cells. Clinical Features, Treatment, and Prognosis of Specific Lymphoid Malignancies.</ref> A [[lumbar puncture]] (also known as a spinal tap) will tell if the spinal column and [[central nervous system|brain]] have been invaded. 

[[Histopathology|Pathological]] examination, [[cytogenetics]] (in particular the presence of [[Philadelphia chromosome]]), and [[immunophenotyping]] establish whether myeloblastic (neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils) or lymphoblastic ([[B lymphocyte]]s or [[T lymphocyte]]s) cells are the problem. RNA testing can establish how aggressive the disease is; different mutations have been associated with shorter or longer survival. [[Immunohistochemistry|Immunohistochemical]] testing may reveal [[Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase|TdT]] or [[Neprilysin|CALLA]] antigens on the surface of leukemic cells. TdT is a protein expressed early in the development of pre-T and pre-B cells, whereas [[Neprilysin|CALLA]] is an antigen found in 80% of ALL cases and also in the "blast crisis" of [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]].

[[Medical imaging]] (such as [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] or [[CT scan]]ning) can find invasion of other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] commonly the [[lung]], liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, kidneys, and reproductive organs.<ref>[http://www.merck.com Merck Manual] {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}</ref>

== Symptoms ==
Initial [[symptoms]] are not specific to ALL, but worsen to the point that medical help is sought. They result from the lack of normal and healthy blood cells because they are crowded out by malignant and immature leukocytes (white blood cells). Therefore, people with ALL experience symptoms from malfunctioning of their erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes, and platelets. Laboratory tests that might show abnormalities include blood count tests, renal function tests, electrolyte tests, and liver enzyme tests.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The signs and symptoms of ALL are variable but follow from bone marrow replacement and/or organ infiltration. 
* Generalized weakness and fatigue
* Anemia
* Frequent or unexplained [[fever]] and [[infection]]
* Weight loss and/or loss of appetite
* Excessive and unexplained bruising
* Bone pain, joint pain (caused by the spread of "blast" cells to the surface of the bone or into the joint from the marrow cavity)
* Breathlessness
* Enlarged lymph nodes,liver and/or spleen
* Pitting edema (swelling) in the lower limbs and/or abdomen
* Petechia, which are tiny red spots or lines in the skin due to low [[platelet]] levels

== Pathophysiology ==
In general, cancer is caused by damage to [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] that leads to uncontrolled cellular growth and spread throughout the body, either by increasing chemical signals that cause growth or by interrupting chemical signals that control growth. Damage can be caused through the formation of [[fusion genes]], as well as the dysregulation of a  [[proto-oncogene]] via juxtaposition of it to the promoter of another gene, e.g. the [[T-cell receptor]] gene. This damage may be caused by environmental factors such as chemicals, drugs or radiation. 

ALL is associated with exposure to [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] and chemicals in animals and humans. High level radiation exposure is a known risk factor for developing leukemia, as found by studies of survivors of [[atom bomb]] exposure in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Leukemia--Acute Lymphocytic|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/leukemia-acutelymphocyticallinadults/detailedguide/leukemia-acute-lymphocytic-risk-factors|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2013}} In animals, exposure to [[benzene]] and other chemicals can cause leukemia. Epidemiological studies have associated leukemia with workplace exposure to chemicals, but these studies are not as conclusive. Some evidence suggests that secondary leukemia can develop in individuals treated for other cancers with radiation and chemotherapy as a result of that treatment.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal

12;21 is the most common translocation and portends a good prognosis. 4;11 is the most common in children under 12 months and portends a poor prognosis.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Prognosis==
The survival rate has improved from zero four decades ago, to 20-75 percent currently, largely due to [[clinical trial]]s on new chemotherapeutic agents and improvements in [[stem cell transplantation]] (SCT) technology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Five-year survival rates evaluate older, not current, treatments. New drugs, and matching treatment to the genetic characteristics of the blast cells, may improve those rates. The prognosis for ALL differs between individuals depending on a variety of factors:

* Gender: females tend to fare better than males.
* Ethnicity: [[Whites|Caucasians]] are more likely to develop acute leukemia than [[African American|African-Americans]], [[Asian American|Asians]] or [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]]. However, they also tend to have a better prognosis than non-Caucasians.
* Age at diagnosis: children between 1–10 years of age are most likely to develop ALL and to be cured of it.  Cases in older patients are more likely to result from chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., the Philadelphia chromosome) that make treatment more difficult and prognoses poorer.
* White blood cell count at diagnosis of less than 50,000/µl
* Cancer spread into the [[Central nervous system]] ([[brain]] or [[spinal cord]]) has worse outcomes.
* Morphological, immunological, and genetic subtypes
* Patient's response to initial treatment
* [[Genetic disorder]]s such as [[Down syndrome|Down's Syndrome]]

[[Cytogenetics]], the study of characteristic large changes in the [[chromosomes]] of [[cancer cell]]s, is an important predictor of outcome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moorman A, Harrison C, Buck G, Richards S, Secker-Walker L, Martineau M, Vance G, Cherry A, Higgins R, Fielding A, Foroni L, Paietta E, Tallman M, Litzow M, Wiernik P, Rowe J, Goldstone A, Dewald G |title=Karyotype is an independent prognostic factor in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): analysis of cytogenetic data from patients treated on the Medical Research Council (MRC) UKALLXII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2993 trial |journal=Blood |volume=109 |issue=8 |pages=3189–97 |year=2007 |pmid=17170120 |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-10-051912}}</ref>

Some cytogenetic subtypes have a worse prognosis than others. These include:

* A translocation between [[chromosome]]s 9 and 22, known as the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], occurs in about 20% of adult and 5% in pediatric cases of ALL.
* A translocation between chromosomes 4 and 11 occurs in about 4% of cases and is most common in infants under 12 months.
* Not all translocations of chromosomes carry a poorer prognosis. Some translocations are relatively favorable. For example, Hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) is a good prognostic factor.
* Genome-wide copy number changes can be assessed by conventional cytogenetics or [[Virtual Karyotype|virtual karyotyping]]. SNP array virtual karyotyping can detect copy number changes and LOH status, while arrayCGH can detect only copy number changes. Copy neutral LOH (acquired uniparental disomy) has been reported at key loci in ALL, such as CDKN2A gene, which have prognostic significance.<ref>Kawamata N, Ogawa S, Zimmermann M, Kato M, Sanada M, Hemminki K, Yamatomo G, Nannya Y, Koehler R, Flohr T, Miller CW, Harbott J, Ludwig WD, Stanulla M, Schrappe M, Bartram CR, Koeffler HP.

== Classification ==
As ALL is not a solid tumour, the [[TNM staging system|TNM]] notation as used in solid cancers is of little use.

===The FAB classification===
Subtyping of the various forms of ALL used to be done according to the [[French-American-British classification|French-American-British (FAB) classification]],<ref name="urlACS :: How Is Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Classified?">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_3X_How_Is_Acute_Lymphocytic_Leukemia_Classified.asp?rnav=cri |title=ACS :: How Is Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Classified? |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> which was used for all acute leukemias (including [[acute myelogenous leukemia]], AML). 

* ALL-L1: small uniform cells
* ALL-L2: large varied cells
* ALL-L3: large varied cells with [[vacuole]]s (bubble-like features)

Each subtype is then further classified by determining the surface markers of the abnormal lymphocytes, called immunophenotyping. There are 2 main immunologic types: pre-B cell and pre-T cell. The mature B-cell ALL (L3) is now classified as [[Burkitt's lymphoma]]/leukemia.  Subtyping helps determine the prognosis and most appropriate treatment in treating ALL.

===WHO proposed classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia===
The recent WHO International panel on ALL recommends that the FAB classification be abandoned, since the morphological classification has no clinical or prognostic relevance. It instead advocates the use of the immunophenotypic classification mentioned below.

The use of a TdT assay and a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to T cell and B cell  associated antigens will identify almost all cases of ALL.

== Treatment ==
The earlier acute lymphocytic leukemia is detected, the more effective the treatment. The aim is to induce a lasting [[remission (medicine)|remission]], defined as the absence of detectable cancer cells in the body (usually less than 5% blast cells in the bone marrow).

Treatment for acute leukemia can include [[chemotherapy]], [[steroid]]s, [[radiation therapy]], intensive combined treatments (including [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow]] or [[stem cell]] transplants), and growth factors.<ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]</ref>

=== Chemotherapy ===
[[Chemotherapy]] is the initial treatment of choice. Most ALL patients will receive a combination of different treatments. There are no surgical options, due to the body-wide distribution of the [[malignant cells]]. In general, cytotoxic chemotherapy for ALL combines multiple antileukemic drugs in various combinations. Chemotherapy for ALL consists of three phases: remission induction, intensification, and maintenance therapy. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Phase
! Description
! Agents
|- 
| Remission induction
| The aim of remission induction is to rapidly kill most tumor cells and get the patient into remission. This is defined as the presence of less than 5% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, normal blood cells and absence of tumor cells from blood, and absence of other signs and symptoms of the disease.  [[Central nervous system]] (CNS) prophylaxis should begin during this phase of treatment and continue during the consolidation/intensification period.  The rationale is based on the presence of CNS involvement in 10%-40% of adult patients at diagnosis.
| Combination of [[Prednisolone]] or [[dexamethasone]], [[vincristine]], [[asparaginase]] (better tolerance in pediatric patients), and [[daunorubicin]] (used in Adult ALL) is used to induce remission.  Central nervous system prophylaxis can achieved via irradiation, [[cytarabine]] + [[methotrexate]], or liposomal cytarabine.<ref>Jabbour E, Thomas D, Cortes J, Kantarjian HM, O'Brien S. Central nervous system prophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: current and emerging therapies. Cancer. 2010 May 15;116(10):2290-300.</ref>
|-
| Consolidation/Intensification 
| Intensification uses high doses of intravenous multidrug chemotherapy to further reduce tumor burden. Since ALL cells sometimes penetrate the CNS, most protocols include delivery of chemotherapy into the CNS fluid (termed [[intrathecal chemotherapy]]). Some centers deliver the drug through [[Ommaya reservoir]] (a device surgically placed under the scalp and used to deliver drugs to the CNS fluid and to extract CNS fluid for various tests). Other centers would perform multiple lumbar punctures as needed for testing and treatment delivery. 
| Typical intensification protocols use vincristine, [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cytarabine]], daunorubicin, [[etoposide]], [[thioguanine]] or [[mercaptopurine]] given as blocks in different combinations. For CNS protection, intrathecal methotrexate or cytarabine is usually used combined with or without cranio-spinal irradiation (the use of radiation therapy to the head and spine). Central nervous system relapse is treated with intrathecal administration of  [[hydrocortisone]], methotrexate, and cytarabine.
|-
| Maintenance therapy 
| The aim of maintenance therapy is to kill any residual cell that was not killed by remission induction, and intensification regimens. Although such cells are few, they will cause relapse if not eradicated. 
| For this purpose, daily oral [[mercaptopurine]], once weekly oral [[methotrexate]], once monthly 5-day course of intravenous [[vincristine]] and oral corticosteroids are usually used. The length of maintenance therapy is 3 years for boys, 2 years for girls and adults.<ref>Hoffbrand AV, Moss PAH, and Pettit JE, "Essential Haematology", Blackwell, 5th ed., 2006.</ref>
|}

As the [[chemotherapy regimens]] can be intensive and protracted (often about 2 years in case of the GMALL UKALL, HyperCVAD or CALGB protocols; for ALL about 3 years, 2 months for males on COG protocols; 2 years, 2 months for females - longer for males, as testicles are a potential reservoir), many patients have an [[intravenous]] catheter inserted into a large vein (termed a [[central venous catheter]] or a [[Hickman line]]), or a [[Portacath]], a cone-shaped port with a silicone nose that is surgically planted under the skin, usually near the collar bone, and the most effective product available, due to low infection risks and the long-term viability of a portacath.

=== Radiation therapy ===
[[Radiation therapy]] (or radiotherapy) is used on painful bony areas, in high disease burdens, or as part of the preparations for a [[bone marrow transplant]] (total body irradiation). Radiation in the form of whole-brain radiation is also used for central nervous system prophylaxis, to prevent recurrence of leukemia in the brain. Whole-brain prophylaxis radiation used to be a common method in treatment of children’s ALL. Recent studies showed that CNS chemotherapy provided results as favorable but with less developmental side-effects. As a result, the use of whole-brain radiation has been more limited.  Most specialists in adult leukemia have abandoned the use of radiation therapy for CNS prophylaxis, instead using intrathecal chemotherapy.

=== Biological therapy ===

=== Immunotherapy ===
Modified [[HIV]] has been used to reprogram the immune system of patients to attack malignant cells exhibiting the [[CD19]] protein with some preliminary success in experimental treatments.<ref>New York Times, ''In Girl’s Last Hope, Altered Immune Cells Beat Leukemia''. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/health/a-breakthrough-against-leukemia-using-altered-t-cells.html?_r=1&</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
In the US, the incidence of ALL is roughly 6000 new cases per year (as of 2009),<ref name=acs>[http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/500809web.pdf Cancer Facts & Figures 2010] at the American Cancer Society</ref> or approximately 1 in 50,000. ALL accounts for approximately 70 percent of all [[childhood leukemia]] cases (ages 0 to 19 years), making it the most common type of childhood cancer.<ref name=acs/> It has a peak incident rate of 2–5 years old, decreasing in incidence with increasing age before increasing again at around 50 years old. ALL is slightly more common in males than females. There is an increased incidence in people with [[Down Syndrome]], [[Fanconi anemia]], [[Bloom syndrome]], [[Ataxia telangiectasia]], [[X-linked agammaglobulinemia]], and [[Severe combined immunodeficiency]].

==In pregnancy==
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.<ref name=Shapira />  How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.  Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of [[pregnancy loss]] and [[birth defect]]s, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive [[first trimester]].<ref name=Shapira>{{cite journal
