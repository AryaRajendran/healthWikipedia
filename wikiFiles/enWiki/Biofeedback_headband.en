[[Image:BiofeedbackHeadband2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Example of a biofeedback headband (front view and back view) for use in measuring and (in theory) the reduction of [[bruxism]] (subconscious teeth clenching and grinding) and [[tension headaches]]]]

A '''biofeedback headband''' is a self-contained [[biofeedback]] unit which is worn on the head and held in place by an elastic strap.  Biofeedback headbands are most often used for controlling [[bruxism]] during sleep, but can also be used during the day. Clenching is sensed through [[electromyography]] (EMG) by picking up [[microvolt]]-level muscle signals from the [[temporalis]] muscles through black conductive rubber sensor pads which contact the user's [[forehead]] and temples when the unit is worn.  Modern biofeedback headbands track clenching and grinding activity as well as providing biofeedback.  After a night of use, the user can read out of the unit both the number of clenching incidents detected, and the total amount of clenching time accumulated through the night.  Biofeedback headbands may also be used to reduce tension headaches and migraines which are caused by bruxism or excessive tightening of [[frontalis muscle]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

==History==
The first biofeedback [[headband]] was invented by Lee Weinstein, in 1998, and patented in September, 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wikipatents.com/US-Patent-6117092/bruxism-biofeedback-apparatus-and-method |title= Bruxism Biofeedback Method and Apparatus | publisher=WikiPatents.com |date= 2000-09-12}}</ref>  Advances were made in the following year and patented in August, 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wikipatents.com/US-Patent-6270466/bruxism-biofeedback-apparatus-and-method-including-acoustic-transducer |title= Bruxism Biofeedback Apparatus and Medhod Including Acoustic Transducer | publisher=WikiPatents.com |date= 2001-08-07}}</ref>  The first headband commercially available for use in the reduction or elimination of bruxism was introduced by BruxCare at the [[Boston Convention and Exhibition Center|Yankee Dental Congress]] in [[Boston]], in February 2001.  These early units had reliability problems and were re-designed by Holistic Technologies in 2007.  The currently available model is sold under the trade name SleepGuard.  All of these units use an [[Audio feedback|audio tone]] as the biofeedback.  

Prior to the development of the biofeedback headband, biofeedback electronics was typically housed in table-top instruments which connected to a person through a set of wires connected to [[electrodes]] which are adhesively connected to the skin.  Sleep labs which offer biofeedback or EMG measurement typically use such table-top EMG measurement and biofeedback equipment.

==Advantages over tabletop biofeedback==

Biofeedback headbands have several advantages over tabletop biofeedback machines. Since a biofeedback headband is self-contained and does not require the use of adhesive sensors or a wiring harness, many people find it easier to sleep using a biofeedback headband than using a table-top bedside biofeedback unit. Acoustic feedback from biofeedback headbands is either a forehead-contacting [[Tactile sound|sound transducer]] or an [[earphone]], both of which have less potential to disturb a sleep partner than a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] on a tabletop unit. Biofeedback headband sensor electrodes typically last through many more uses than adhesive electrodes, and are much less costly to use over time. Finally, mobility is not inhibited by wearing a biofeedback headband as it is by the wiring harness of typical bedside biofeedback equipment.

==Battery life==

The original models, introduced in 2001, employed [[rechargeable batteries]] which lasted about three days before needing to be recharged.  The [[lithium ion batteries]] used in those original units unfortunately suffered from a problem that if a unit was allowed to totally discharge (for instance, by being left in a drawer without use for a month or two), the batteries would no longer hold a charge.

In the following years, there were a series of improvements to the design, reducing power consumption, and eventually the rechargeable units were replaced with units which run on inexpensive disposable batteries.  Modern units such as the SleepGuard biofeedback headband can typically be used for more than 35 nights on a single set of batteries.

==Effect on sleep==

Users who already suffer from reduced [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]] due to bruxism may get more REM sleep using a biofeedback headband and may, therefore, experience more restful sleep.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}  However, users whose sleep was not already compromised by bruxism may find sleep less comfortable or restful using a biofeedback headband.
