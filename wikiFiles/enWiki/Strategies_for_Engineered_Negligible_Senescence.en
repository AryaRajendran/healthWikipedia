'''Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS)''' is the term coined by British biogerontologist [[Aubrey de Grey]] for the diverse range of [[Regenerative medicine|regenerative medical]] therapies, either planned or currently in development,<ref>Research Themes (February 4, 2013). "http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research".

The term "[[negligible senescence]]" was first used in the early 1990s by professor [[Caleb Finch]] to describe organisms such as [[lobsters]] and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]]s, which do not show symptoms of aging. The term "engineered negligible senescence" first appeared in print in [[Aubrey de Grey]]'s 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'',<ref name="isbn1587061554">de Grey, Aubrey (November 2003).

==Framework==

[[File:Aging treatment approaches.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arrows with flat heads are a notation meaning "inhibits," used in the literature of gene expression and gene regulation.]]

The ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.<ref name=EndingAging/>

De Grey defines aging as "the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an [[adult]] [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death."<ref name="pmid12844502">de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. PMID 12844502.</ref> He adds: "[[geriatrics]] is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional [[gerontology]] is the attempt to stop [[metabolism]] from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." The SENS approach to biomedical [[gerontology]] is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.

By enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of [[biogerontology]], a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute [[negligible senescence]]:

For each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..

==Types of aging damage and treatment schemes==

===Cancer-causing nuclear mutations/epimutations—OncoSENS===
These are changes to the nuclear [[DNA]] (nDNA), the molecule that contains our genetic information, or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain [[mutation]]s can lead to cancer, and, according to de Grey, non-cancerous mutations and [[epimutation]]s do not contribute to aging within a normal lifespan, so cancer is the only endpoint of these types of damage that must be addressed. A mutation in a functional gene of a cell can cause that cell to malfunction or to produce a malfunctioning product, because of the sheer number of cells, de Grey believes that redundancy takes care of this problem, although cells that have mutated to produce toxic products might have to be disabled. For the purposes of SENS, the effect of mutations and epimutations that really matters is [[cancer]], this is because if even one cell turns into a cancer cell it might spread and become deadly. This would need to be corrected by a [[cure for cancer]], if any is ever found.  The SENS program focuses on a strategy called "whole-body interdiction of lengthening [[telomere]]s" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic [[regenerative medicine]] treatments (see below). Restoring telomeres would protect the ends of DNA from being cut off after successive divisions since each one normally removes some which is at first the telomere.

===Mitochondrial mutations—MitoSENS===

Mitochondria are components in our [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for [[energy]] production. They contain their own genetic material, and mutations to their DNA can affect a cell’s ability to function properly. Indirectly, these mutations may accelerate many aspects of aging. Because of the highly oxidative environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems found in cell nucleus, mitochondrial mutations are believed to a be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration. This would be corrected by [[allotopic expression]]&mdash;copying the [[DNA]] for mitochondria completely within the cellular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it is better protected. In humans, all but 13 proteins are already protected in this way. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible. However, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too hydrophobic to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria,<ref>Oca-Cossio, J. et al., 2003. Limitations of Allotopic Expression of Mitochondrial Genes in Mammalian Cells. Genetics, 165(2), 707-720.
</ref> and this is perhaps one of the reasons that not all of the mitochondrial genes have migrated to the nucleus during the course of evolution.

===Intracellular junk—LysoSENS===

Our cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested simply accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is readily detected in the form of [[lipofuscin]] granules. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]], [[liver spot]]s on the skin and all kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as Alzheimer's disease) are associated with this problem. Junk inside cells might be removed by adding new enzymes to the cell's natural [[digestion]] organ, the [[lysosome]]. These enzymes would be taken from [[bacteria]], [[mold]]s and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.

===Extracellular junk—AmyloSENS===

Harmful junk protein can also accumulate outside of our cells. Junk outside cells might be removed by enhanced [[phagocytosis]] (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]]. The oft-mentioned "toxins" that are identified as causes of many diseases most likely fit under this class.

===Cell loss and atrophy—RepleniSENS===

Some of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body.  Muscle cells are lost in [[skeletal muscle]]s and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age.  Loss of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] causes [[Parkinson's disease]], while loss of immune cells impairs the [[immune system]].  Cell depletion can be partly corrected by therapies involving [[exercise]] and [[growth factor]]s. But [[stem cell therapy]], [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells. De Grey points out that this research of [[stem cell treatments]] is playing an increasingly important role in the international scientific community and progress is already occurring on many fronts. However, a large number of details are involved, and most such treatments are still experimental.

===Cell senescence—ApoptoSENS===

This is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other things that they are not supposed to do, like secreting proteins that could be harmful.  Degeneration of [[joint]]s, immune senescence, accumulation of [[visceral fat]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called [[apoptosis]], to instruct cells to destroy themselves. An example is the state known as [[Cellular_senescence#Cellular_senescence|cellular senescence]]. Cells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose, and healthy cells would multiply to replace them. Cell killing with [[suicide gene]]s or [[vaccine]]s is suggested for making the cells undertake apoptosis.

===Extracellular crosslinks—GlycoSENS===

Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many cross-links form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak. De Grey proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and [[enzyme]]s to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s, and other common forms of chemical linking.

==Scientific controversy==
While some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., [[stem cell research]] (RepleniSENS), [[Alzheimer's disease clinical research|anti-Alzheimers research]] (AmyloSENS) and [[oncogenomics]] (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an [[Aging-associated diseases|aging-associated disease]] (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature<ref>{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging

In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO reports]]'', "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,"<ref name="pmid16264422">Warner H ''et al.'' (November 2005). "Science fact and the SENS agenda. What can we reasonably expect from ageing research?". ''EMBO reports''. 6 (11): 1006&ndash;1008. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}. PMID 16264422.</ref> arguing "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,"<ref name="pmid16264422"/> and that some of the specific proposals "will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful."<ref name="pmid16264422"/> The researchers argue that while there is "a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,"<ref name="pmid16264422"/> increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 ''EMBO reports'' article previously published by de Grey<ref>de Grey, Aubrey (July 2005). "Resistance to debate on how to postpone ageing is delaying progress and costing lives". ''EMBO reports''. 6 (S1): S49–S53. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400399}}.

"Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology". ''EMBO reports''. 6 (11): 1000. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400565}}.

In 2012, [[Colin Blakemore]] criticised SENS extensively in a debate hosted at the [[Oxford University]] Scientific Society.

===Technology Review controversy===
{{Main|De Grey Technology Review controversy}}

In February 2005, ''[[Technology Review]]'', which is owned by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published an article by [[Sherwin Nuland]], a Clinical Professor of Surgery at [[Yale University]] and the author of "How We Die",<ref>Nuland, Sherwin (1994). ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. New York: Knopf Random House. ISBN 0-679-41461-4.</ref> that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/flybase.htm Flybase Facility] of the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Genetics] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The April 2005 issue of ''Technology Review'' contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey <ref>de Grey, Aubrey (April2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14097&ch=infotech Aubrey de Grey Responds]", ''Technology Review''.</ref> and numerous comments from readers.<ref>TR Readers (April 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14310&ch=infotechReaders LETTERS: Our February cover story on Aubrey de Grey and antiaging science lives on]". ''Technology Review''.</ref>

During June 2005 [[David Gobel]], CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate."<ref>Pontin, Jason (July 28, 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/ The SENS Challenge]". ''Technology Review''.</ref> ''Technology Review'' received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, ''Technology Review'' announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge.<ref>Pontin, Jason (March 14, 2006). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/16593/ We've picked the judges for our biogerontology prize]". ''Technology Review''.</ref> Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by ''Technology Review'' on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, ''Technology Review'' published the results of the SENS Challenge.<ref name="PontinJuly112006"/><ref>"[http://www.mprize.com/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&ID=0104 SENS Withstands Three Challenges : $20,000 Remains Unclaimed]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.</ref> 

In the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by [[Preston Estep]] and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. [[Craig Venter]] succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: "Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it."<ref name="PontinJuly112006"/> Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is "highly speculative" and that many of its proposals could be reproduced with the scientific technology of that period. Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of "antechamber of science" where they wait for independent vindication.<ref name="PontinJuly112006"/><ref name="Invincible Man"/> In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.

==Social and economic implications==

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds — 100,000 per day — die of age-related causes.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011">{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}</ref> In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/>

De Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky ''et al.'' 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050.<ref name=TheLongevityDividend>Olshansky, S. Jay; Perry, Daniel; Miller, Richard A.; Butler, Robert N. (March 2006).

''The Scientist''. 20 (3): 28–36.</ref> "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [invest further in aging research]. Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example."<ref name=TheLongevityDividend/>

== SENS Research Foundation ==
{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

The SENS Research Foundation is a [[non-profit organization]] co-founded by Michael Kope, [[Aubrey de Grey]], Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in [[California]], [[United States]]. Its activities include [[SENS]]-based research programs and [[public relations]] work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.

Before March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.  The [[Methuselah Foundation]] is most notable for establishing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]], a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.<ref name=MFMission>
