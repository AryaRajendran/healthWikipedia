Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast the 1918 pandemic killed predominantly previously healthy young adults. Modern research, using virus taken from the bodies of frozen victims, has concluded that the virus kills through a [[cytokine storm]] (overreaction of the body's [[immune system]]). The strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.<ref name=Barry_book/>

Historical and [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] data are inadequate to identify the pandemic's geographic origin.<ref name=cdc2006/>
It was implicated in the outbreak of [[encephalitis lethargica]] in the 1920s.<ref name="pmid17675021">{{cite journal |author=Vilensky JA, Foley P, Gilman S |title=Children and encephalitis lethargica: a historical |journal=Pediatr.

==History==
The close quarters and massive troop movements of [[World War I]] hastened the pandemic and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.<ref>Ewald 1994, p. 110.</ref>

Academic [[Andrew Price-Smith]] has made the controversial argument that the virus helped tip the balance of power in the later days of the war towards the Allied cause. He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before they hit the Allied powers, and that both [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France.<ref>Andrew Price-Smith, Contagion and Chaos, MIT Press, 2009.</ref>

A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of this flu was increased travel. Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease.<ref>{{cite video

In the United States, the disease was first observed in [[Haskell County, Kansas]], in January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the U.S. Public Health Service's academic journal. On 4 March 1918, company cook Albert Gitchell reported sick at [[Fort Riley, Kansas]]. By noon on 11 March 1918, over 100 soldiers were in the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Influenza 1918|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/influenza/player/|work=American Experience|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Within days, 522 men at the camp had reported sick.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080521071645/http://www.avian-bird-flu.info/spanishfluepidemic1918.html Avian Bird Flu.

In August 1918, a more virulent strain appeared simultaneously in [[Brest, France|Brest]], Brittany-France, in [[Freetown|Freetown, Sierra Leone]], and in the U.S. in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. The [[Allies of World War I]] came to call it the Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/spanish%20flu%20facts/111285 Channel 4&nbsp;– News&nbsp;– Spanish flu facts].</ref>

This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected to be caused by [[cytokine storm]]s.<ref name="Patterson1"/> Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as [[dengue]], [[cholera]], or [[typhoid]].

Bleeding from the ears and [[petechia|petechial hemorrhages]] in the skin also occurred."<ref name=Knobler/> The majority of deaths were from [[bacterial pneumonia]], a [[secondary infection]] caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive [[bleeding|hemorrhages]] and [[edema]] in the lung.<ref name="Taubenberger">{{cite journal | last = Taubenberger | first = J | coauthors = Reid A, Janczewski T, Fanning T | title = Integrating historical, clinical and molecular genetic data in order to explain the origin and virulence of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 356 | issue = 1416 | pages = 1829–39 | year = 2001 | month=29 December | pmid = 11779381 | url= http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/(3sud2455cjw1ut55yowx1d45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,3,22;journal,61,225;linkingpublicationresults,1:102022,1 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2001.1020 | pmc = 1088558}}</ref>

===Patterns of fatality===
An unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40&nbsp;years old.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Simonsen | first = L | coauthors = Clarke M, Schonberger L, Arden N, Cox N, Fukuda K | title = Pandemic versus epidemic influenza mortality: a pattern of changing age distribution | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 178 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–60 | year = 1998 | month=July | pmid = 9652423}}</ref> This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as [[infant]]s (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the [[immunocompromise]]d. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the previous [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2#Russian flu|Russian flu pandemic of 1889]].<ref name=hansen>O Hansen, 1923, ''Undersøkelser om influenzaens opptræden specielt i Bergen 1918–1922'' Skrifter utgit ved Klaus Hanssens Fond. Bergen: Medicinsk avdeling, Haukeland Sykehus, 1923: 3.</ref>
According to historian John M. Barry, the most vulnerable of all – "those most likely, of the most likely", to die – were pregnant women. He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic, the death rate ranged from 23% to 71%. Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth, over one-quarter (26%) lost the child.<ref>Barry, John M. 2004. The Great Influenza. Penguin Books. p. 239 ISBN 0-14-303448-0</ref>

Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn (in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]); influenza is usually worse in winter.<ref>Key Facts about Swine Influenza [http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/key_facts.htm] accessed 22:45 GMT-6 30 April 2009. [http://www.webcitation.org/5gWiDErWS Archived] 4 May 2009.</ref>

Modern analysis has shown the virus to be particularly deadly because it triggers a [[cytokine storm]], which ravages the stronger immune system of young adults.<ref name=Barry_book/>

In fast-progressing cases, mortality was primarily from [[pneumonia]], by virus-induced pulmonary [[consolidation (medicine)|consolidation]]. Slower-progressing cases featured secondary bacterial pneumonias, and there may have been [[neural]] involvement that led to [[mental disorders]] in some cases. Some deaths resulted from malnourishment.

===Deadly second wave===
The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. But in August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone and the United States,<ref>UK Parliament&nbsp;– http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/88/88.pdf. Accessed 2009-05-06. [http://www.webcitation.org/5gcuRTA6L Archived] 8 May 2009.</ref> the virus had [[mutation|mutated]] to a much deadlier form. This has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War.<ref name=deadzone1>

In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).<ref name=deadzone2>

The fact that most of those who recovered from first-wave infections were now [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] showed that it must have been the same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in [[Copenhagen]], which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.<ref>{{cite web

On the rest of the population it was far more deadly now; the most vulnerable people were those like the soldiers in the trenches – young healthy adults.<ref>

===Devastated communities===
[[File:Spanish flu death chart.png|thumb|350px|A chart of deaths in major cities.]]
Even in areas where mortality was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by [[steam shovel]] and bodies buried without coffins in many places.<ref>Fortune article " [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/11/01/8189572/index.htm Viruses of Mass Destruction]" written 1 November 2004. accessed 01:12 GMT+1 30 April 2009</ref>

Several [[Pacific island]] territories were particularly hard-hit. The pandemic reached them from New Zealand, which was too slow to implement measures to prevent [[SS Talune|ships carrying the flu]] from leaving its ports. From New Zealand, the flu reached [[Tonga]] (killing 8% of the population), [[Nauru]] (16%) and [[Fiji]] (5%, 9,000 people).<ref name="DENOON, Donald 2004, p. 247">DENOON, Donald, “New Economic Orders: Land, Labour and Dependency”, in DENOON, Donald (éd.), ''The Cambridge History of the Pacific Islanders'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-00354-7, p. 247.</ref>

Worst affected was [[Samoa|Western Samoa]], a territory then under New Zealand military administration. A crippling 90% of the population was infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died.  By contrast, the flu was kept away from [[American Samoa]] when [[Governor of American Samoa|Governor]] [[John Martin Poyer]] imposed a blockade.<ref name="DENOON, Donald 2004, p. 247"/> In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%.<ref>RICE, Geoffrey, ''Black November; the 1918 Ifluenza Pandemic in New Zealand'', University of Canterbury Press, 2005, ISBN 1-877257-35-4, p. 221.</ref>

===Less-affected areas===
In Japan, 257,363 deaths were attributed to influenza by July 1919, giving an estimated 0.425% mortality rate, much lower than nearly all other Asian countries for which data are available. The Japanese government severely restricted maritime travel to and from the home islands when the pandemic struck.

Pandemic influenza: emergency planning and community preparedness. Boca Raton : CRC Press, 2009. P. 24</ref>

===Aspirin poisoning===
In a 2009 paper published in the journal ''Clinical Infectious Diseases'', Karen Starko proposed that [[aspirin poisoning]] had contributed substantially to the fatalities. She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, and the timing of the big "death spike" in October 1918 which happened right after the Surgeon General, of the US Army, and the Journal of the American Medical Association both recommended very large (by today's standards) dosages of aspirin.<ref name=starko>{{cite journal|title=Salicylates and Pandemic Influenza Mortality, 1918–1919, Pharmacology, Pathology, and Historic Evidence|author=Karen M. Starko|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2009|volume=49|issue=9|pages=1405–1410|doi=10.1086/606060}}</ref> Further, Starko suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a "[[perfect storm]]" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin ran out, so that many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the flu pandemic; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning (such as [[Reye's syndrome]]) were not known at the time.<ref name=starko />

This hypothesis, insofar as it sought to provide an explanation to the ''universally'' high mortality rate, was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010. In it, Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson, of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, questioned this universal applicability given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time.<ref name="noymer">{{cite journal|title=Questioning the salicylates and influenza pandemic mortality hypothesis in 1918–1919|journal=Clinical infectious diseases|page=1203|author=Noymer et al.|year=2010|volume=50|issue=8}}</ref>

On this basis, they concluded that "the [[salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difﬁcult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918–1919 inﬂuenza pandemic".<ref name="noymer"/> In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin over-prescription in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a major factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reply to Noymer et al.|journal=Clinical infectious diseases|page=1203|author=Karen Starko|year=2010|volume=50|issue=8}}</ref>

===End of the pandemic===
After the lethal second wave struck in the autumn of 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;– almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.<ref name=Barry_book>Barry 2004 {{page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref> In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 people died in the week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.<ref name=Barry_book/>

Another theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out.<ref name=Barry_book/>

==Cultural and economic impact==
{{see also|List of 1918 flu pandemic cases}}
[[File:1918 flu in Oakland.jpg|thumb|250px|[[American Red Cross]] nurses tend to flu patients in temporary wards set up inside [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] Municipal Auditorium, 1918.]]

In the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries, despite the relatively high [[morbidity]] and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic in 1918–1919, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>Honigsbaum</ref> This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a "forgotten pandemic".<ref name="Crosby 2003"/>

Various theories of why the Spanish flu was "forgotten" include the rapid pace of the pandemic, which killed most of its victims in the United States, for example, within a period of less than nine months, resulting in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, yellow fever, diphtheria, and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.<ref>Morrisey, Carla R. "The Influenza Epidemic of 1918." Navy Medicine 77, no. 3 (May–June 1986): 11–17.</ref> In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.<ref name="Benedict2000">{{cite book|last1=Benedict|first1=Michael Les|last2=Braithwaite|first2=Max|authorlink2=Max Braithwaite|title=In the face of disaster: true stories of Canadian heroes from the archives of Maclean's|year=2000|publisher=Viking|location=New York, N.Y|isbn=0-670-88883-4|page=38|chapter=The Year of the Killer Flu}}</ref>

In addition, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.<ref>Crosby 2003, pp. 320–322.</ref> Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere "extension" of the war's tragedies.<ref>Simonsen, L; Clarke M, Schonberger L, Arden N, Cox N, Fukuda K (Jul 1998). "Pandemic versus epidemic influenza mortality: a pattern of changing age distribution."</ref>

The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which most expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck. This left little time for the disease to have a significant impact on the economy.

One final issue that the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak had on the world was the effects on the global economy. Many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, but the health care industry reported profit gains.<ref>Garrett 2007</ref>

Bristow shows there was a gendered response of health caregivers to the pandemic in the United States.   Male doctors were unable to cure the patients, and they felt like failures.  Women nurses also saw their patients die, but they took pride in their success in fulfilling their professional role of caring for, ministering, comforting, and easing the last hours of their patients, and helping the families of the patients cope as well. <ref>Nancy K. Bristow, ''American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic'' (Oxford University Press, 2012)</ref>

[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as Dr. Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]

The origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease.[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/influenza.html (Harvard Open Collections)] Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.<ref name=influenzareport>Sometimes a virus contains both avian-adapted genes and human-adapted genes. Both the [[H2N2]] and [[H3N2]] pandemic strains contained avian flu virus [[RNA]] segments. "While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source (Belshe 2005)." (from [http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/ai.htm Chapter Two: Avian Influenza by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner], an excellent free on-line book called ''Influenza Report 2006'' which is a medical textbook that provides a comprehensive overview of epidemic and pandemic influenza.)</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Taubenberger JK, Reid AH, Lourens RM, Wang R, Jin G, Fanning TG |title=Characterization of the 1918 influenza virus polymerase genes |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7060 |pages=889–93 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16208372 |doi=10.1038/nature04230}}</ref>

J Mol Evol</ref> This ancestor virus diverged about 1913–1915 into two [[clade]]s (or biological groups), which gave rise to the classical swine and human [[H1N1]] influenza lineages. The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans,  they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.

An effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in New York City.  The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's genetic sequence, using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist [[Johan Hultin]] from a female flu victim buried in the Alaskan [[permafrost]] and samples preserved from American soldiers.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r051005.htm Center for Disease Control: Researchers Reconstruct 1918 Pandemic Influenza Virus; Effort Designed to Advance Preparedness] Retrieved on 2 September 2009</ref>

On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. reported that monkeys (''[[Macaca fascicularis]]'') infected with the recreated strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a [[cytokine storm]]<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kobasa | first = Darwyn | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Aberrant innate immune response in lethal infection of macaques with the 1918 influenza virus | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7125| pages = 319–323 | doi = 10.1038/nature05495| pmid = 17230189 }}</ref>—an overreaction of the [[immune system]]. This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as a person with a stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/flu-research.htm?POE=NEWISVA USA Today: Research on monkeys finds resurrected 1918 flu killed by turning the body against itself] Retrieved on 14 August 2008.</ref>

On 16 September 2008, the body of British politician and diplomat [[Mark Sykes|Sir Mark Sykes]] was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern [[H5N1]] bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped to have helped preserve the virus.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/7617968.stm BBC News: Body exhumed in fight against flu] Retrieved on 16 September 2008.</ref> However, the coffin was found to be split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining ''in situ'' in the grave during this process.<ref>[[BBC Four]] documentary. ''In Search of Spanish Flu''</ref>

In December 2008, research by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the [[University of Wisconsin]] linked the presence of three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a nucleoprotein derived from 1918 flu samples to the ability of the flu virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE4BS56420081229 |title=Reuters. December 29, 2008.

In June 2010, a team at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine reported the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine]] provided some cross-protection against the 1918 flu pandemic strain.<ref name=cross-protection>{{cite news | title = Swine flu shot protects against 1918 flu: study | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65E65S20100616 |agency=Reuters | date = 16 June 2010 | first=Maggie | last=Fox }}</ref>

One of the few things known for certain about the influenza in 1918 and for some years after was that it was, out of the laboratory, exclusively a disease of human beings.<ref>Crosby, Alfred. “America’s Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918.” New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989.
