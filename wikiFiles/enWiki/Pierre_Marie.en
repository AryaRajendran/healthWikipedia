}}'''Pierre Marie''' (9 September 1853 – 13 April 1940) was a French [[neurology|neurologist]] who was a native of [[Paris]].

==Life and career==
After finishing medical school, he served as an interne (1878), working as an assistant to neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825–1893) at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière]] and [[Bicêtre Hospital|Bicêtre]] Hospitals in Paris. In 1883 he received his medical doctorate with a graduate thesis on [[Basedow syndrome|Basedow’s disease]], being promoted to ''médecin des hôpitaux'' several years later (1888). In 1907 he attained the chair of [[pathological anatomy]] at the Faculty of Medicine, and in 1917 was appointed to the chair of [[neurology]], a position he held until 1925. In 1911 Marie became a member of the ''[[Académie de Médecine]]''.

One of Marie's earlier contributions was a description of a disorder of the [[pituitary gland]] known as [[acromegaly]]. His analysis of the disease was an important contribution in the emerging field of [[endocrinology]]. Marie is also credited as the first to describe pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] and [[rhizomelia|rhizomelic]] [[spondylosis]]. In his extensive research of [[aphasia]], his views concerning language disorders sharply contrasted the generally accepted views of [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880). In 1907, he was the first person to describe the [[speech production]] disorder of [[foreign accent syndrome]].<ref>Marie P. (1907). Presentation de malades atteints d’anarthrie par lesion de l’hemisphere gauche du cerveau. ''Bulletins et Memoires Societe Medicale des Hopitaux de Paris'', 1: 158–160.</ref> 

Marie was the first general secretary of the ''Société Française de Neurologie'', and with [[Édouard Brissaud]] (1852–1909), he was co-founder of the journal ''Revue neurologique''. His name is associated with the eponymous [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]], being named along with [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and [[Howard Henry Tooth]] (1856–1925). This disease is characterized by gradual progressive loss of distal muscle tissue in the arms and feet. It is considered the most common disease within a group of conditions known as [[Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy|"hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies" (HMSN)]].<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/30.html Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease] @ [[Who Named It]]</ref>

== Associated eponyms ==
* "Marie's ataxia": an hereditary disease of the [[nervous system]], with [[ataxia|cerebellar ataxia]].
* "Marie-Foix-Alajouanine syndrome": [[ataxia|cerebellar ataxia]] of the [[cerebellum]] in the elderly; usually due to alcohol abuse. Named along with neurologists [[Théophile Alajouanine]] (1890–1980) and [[Charles Foix]] (1882–1927).
* "Marie's anarthria": inability to articulate words due to cerebral lesions.
* "Marie–Strümpel Disease": also known as [[Ankylosing spondylitis]]; a severe arthritic spinal deformity. Named along with German neurologist [[Adolph Strümpell]] (1853–1925). The disease is sometimes referred to as "Bekhterev Disease"; named after Russian neurophysiologist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] (1857–1927).
* "Marie-Léri syndrome": hand deformity caused by [[osteolysis]] of the articular surfaces of the fingers. Named with neurologist [[André Léri]] (1875–1930).
* "Bamberger-Marie disease": also known as [[Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy]]. Named with Austrian [[internist]] [[Eugen von Bamberger]] (1858–1921).
