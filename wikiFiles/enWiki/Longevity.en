The word "'''longevity'''" is sometimes used as a synonym for "[[life expectancy]]" in [[demography]] - however, the term "longevity" is sometimes meant to refer only to especially long lived members of a population, whereas "life expectancy" is always defined statistically as the average number of years remaining at a given age. For example, a population's life expectancy at birth is the same as the average age at death for all people born in the same year (in the case of cohorts). Longevity is best thought of as a term for general audiences meaning 'typical length of life' and specific statistical definitions should be clarified when necessary.

Reflections on longevity have usually gone beyond acknowledging the brevity of human life and have included thinking about methods to extend life. Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of [[Hyperborei|travel]], [[science fiction]], and [[utopia]]n novels.

There are many difficulties in authenticating the longest human [[maximum life span|life span]] ever by modern verification standards, owing to inaccurate or incomplete birth statistics. Fiction, legend, and folklore have proposed or claimed life spans in the past or future vastly longer than those verified by modern standards, and [[longevity narratives]] and unverified [[longevity claims]] frequently speak of their existence in the present.

A [[life annuity]] is a form of [[longevity insurance]].

==History==
A remarkable statement mentioned by [[Diogenes Laertius]] (c. 250 AD) is the earliest (or at least one of the earliest) references about ''plausible'' centenarian longevity given by a scientist, the astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of Nicea (c. 185 – c. 120 BC), who, according to the [[doxographer]], was ''assured'' that the philosopher [[Democritus of Abdera]] (c. 470/460 – c. 370/360 BC) lived 109 years. All other accounts given by the ancients about the age of Democritus appear, without giving any specific age, to agree that the philosopher lived over 100 years. This possibility is likely, given that many ancient Greek philosophers are thought to have lived over the age of 90 (e.g.,  [[Xenophanes of Colophon]], c. 570/565 – c. 475/470 BC, [[Pyrrho]] of Ellis, c. 360 – c. 270 BC,  [[Eratosthenes]] of Cirene, c. 285 – c. 190 BC, etc.). The case of Democritus is different from the case of, for example, [[Epimenides]] of Crete (7th, 6th centuries BC), who is said to have lived 154, 157 or 290 years, as has been said about countless elders even during the last centuries as well as in the present time. These cases are not verifiable by modern means.

Various factors contribute to an individual's longevity. Significant factors in life expectancy include [[gender]], [[genetics]], access to [[health care]], [[hygiene]], diet and [[nutrition]], [[exercise]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], and [[crime rates]]. Below is a list of life expectancies in different types of countries:<ref name="ciawfb2010">The US [[Central Intelligence Agency]], 2010, [[CIA World Factbook]], retrieved 12 Jan. 2011, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html</ref>

==Long-lived individuals==
The [[Gerontology Research Group]] validates current longevity records by modern standards, and maintains a [[list of supercentenarians]]; many other unvalidated [[longevity claims]] exist. Record-holding individuals include:
*[[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]] (1788–1899, 110 years, 135 days): first person to reach the age of 110 (on September 21, 1898) and whose age could be validated.
*[[Jeanne Calment]] (1875–1997, 122 years, 164 days): the oldest person in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation. This defines the modern human [[maximum life span|life span]], which is set by the oldest documented individual who ever lived.
*[[Sarah Knauss]] (1880–1999, 119 years, 97 days): the second oldest documented person in modern times and the oldest American.
*[[Jiroemon Kimura]] (born 1897): celebrated his 115th birthday in April 2012, currently the oldest living person and the oldest man in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation.
*[[Misao Okawa]] (born 1898): the oldest living woman in the world.

==Longevity and lifestyle==
[[File:Nursing home.JPG|thumb|Old man at a [[nursing home]] in [[Norway]].]]
Evidence-based studies indicate that longevity is based on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices.<ref name=USC>{{Cite news |first=Carl |last=Marziali |date=7 December 2010 |title=Reaching Toward the Fountain of Youth |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/health/reaching_toward_the_fountain_of_youth.html |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2010}}</ref> Twin studies have estimated that approximately 20-30% of an individual’s lifespan is related to genetics, the rest is due to individual behaviors and environmental factors which can be modified.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hjelmborg |first=J. |last2=''et al.'' |year=2006 |title=Genetic influence on human lifespan and longevity |journal=[[Human Genetics (journal)|Human Genetics]] |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=312–321 |doi=10.1007/s00439-006-0144-y |first2=Ivan |last3=Skytthe |first3=Axel |last4=Vaupel |first4=James W. |last5=McGue |first5=Matt |last6=Koskenvuo |first6=Markku |last7=Kaprio |first7=Jaakko |last8=Pedersen |first8=Nancy L. |last9=Christensen |first9=Kaare }}</ref> Recent studies find that even modest amounts of leisure time physical exercise can extend life expectancy by as much as 4.5 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=S.C.|last2=et al. |year=2012| title=Leisure time physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity and mortality:  A large pooled cohort analysis|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=9|issue=11}}</ref>

In preindustrial times, deaths at young and middle age were common, and lifespans over 70 years were comparatively rare. This is not due to genetics, but because of environmental factors such as disease, accidents, and malnutrition, especially since the former were not generally treatable with pre-20th century medicine. Deaths from childbirth were common in women, and many children did not live past infancy. In addition, most people who did attain old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems. Despite this, we do find a large number of examples of pre-20th century individuals attaining lifespans of 75 years or greater, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Adams]], [[Cato the Elder]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Eric of Pomerania]], [[Christopher Polhem]], and [[Michaelangelo]]. This was also true for poorer people like [[peasant]]s or [[laborer]]s. [[Genealogy|Genealogists]] will almost certainly find ancestors living to their 70s, 80s and even 90s several hundred years ago.

For example, an 1871 census in the UK (the first of its kind) found the average male life expectancy as being 44, but if infant mortality is subtracted, males who lived to adulthood averaged 75 years. The present male life expectancy in the UK is 77 years for males and 81 for females (the United States averages 74 for males and 80 for females).

Studies have shown that African-American males have the shortest lifespans of any group of people in the US, averaging only 69 years (Asian American females average the longest).<ref>{{Cite journal |first=John |last=Keaten |date=17 October 2012 |title=Health in America Today|url=http://www.measureofamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AHDP-HEALTH-FACT-SHEET-11.08.10.pdf |work= Measure of America |accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> This reflects overall poorer health and greater prevalence of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer among African-American men.

Women normally outlive men, and this was as true in pre-industrial times as today. Theories for this include smaller bodies (and thus less stress on the heart), a stronger immune system (since testosterone acts as an immunosuppressant), and less tendency to engage in physically dangerous activities.

==Future==
The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] view on the future of longevity is that life expectancy in the [[United States]] will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The [[United Nations]] has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the [[industrialization]] and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.<ref>[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf World Population to 2300], [[United Nations]]</ref>

Recent increases in the rates of [[lifestyle diseases]], such as [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and [[heart disease]], may drastically slow or reverse this trend toward increasing life expectancy in the developed world.

Scientist Olshansky examined how much mortality from various causes would have to drop in order to boost life expectancy and concluded that most of the past increases in life expectancy occurred because of improved survival rates for young people.  He states that it seems unlikely that life expectancy at birth will ever exceed 85 years.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Jennifer Couzin-Frankel |title= A Pitched Battle Over Life Span |journal=Science|pages= 549–50 |volume= 333 |date= 29 July 2011|doi= 10.1126/science.333.6042.549|pmid= 21798928|issue= 6042}}</ref>

However, since 1840, record life expectancy has risen [[linear]]ly for men and women, albeit more slowly for men. For women the increase has been almost three months per year. In light of steady increase, without any sign of limitation, the suggestion that life expectancy will top out must be treated with caution. Scientists Oeppen and Vaupel observe that experts who assert that "life expectancy is approaching a ceiling ... have repeatedly been proven wrong." It is thought that life expectancy for women has increased more dramatically owing to the considerable advances in medicine related to childbirth.<ref>{{cite journal

Mice have been genetically engineered to live twice as long as ordinary mice.  Drugs such as deprenyl are a part of the prescribing pharmacopia of veterinarians specifically to increase mammal lifespan.  A large plurality of research chemicals have been described at the scientific literature that increase the lifespan of a number of species.

Some argue that [[molecular nanotechnology]] will greatly extend human life spans. If the rate of increase of life span can be raised with these technologies to a level of twelve months increase per year, this is defined as effective [[biological immortality]] and is the goal of radical life extension.

==Biological immortality==
{{Main|Biological immortality}}
Certain exotic organisms do not seem to be subject to aging and can live indefinitely. Examples include [[Tardigrades]] and [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]]. That is not to say that these organisms cannot die, merely that they only die as a result of disease or injury rather than age-related deterioration (and that they are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]]).
