'''Second-degree AV block''' is a disease of the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system]] of the [[heart]]. It refers to a [[conduction block]] between the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] and [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]. 

The presence of second-degree AV block is diagnosed when one or more (but not all) of the atrial impulses fail to conduct to the ventricles due to impaired conduction.

==Types==
There are two non-distinct types of second-degree AV block, called ''Type 1'' and ''Type 2''.  In both types, a P wave is blocked from initiating a [[QRS complex]]; but, in Type 1, there are increasing delays in each cycle before the omission, whereas, in Type 2, there is no such pattern.<ref name="urlLesson VI - ECG Conduction Abnormalities">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/kw/ecg/ecg_outline/Lesson6/index.html#Wenckebach |title=Lesson VI - ECG Conduction Abnormalities |work= |accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>

Type 1 second-degree heart block is considered a more benign entity than type 2 second-degree heart block.<ref>http://health.medicscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SeconddegreeAVblock2_thumb.jpg</ref>

Both types are named after [[Woldemar Mobitz]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2824}}</ref><ref>W. Mobitz.

===Type 1 (Mobitz I/Wenckebach)===<!-- This section is linked from [[Atropine]] -->
'''Type 1 Second-degree AV block''', also known as '''Mobitz I''' or '''[[Karel Frederik Wenckebach|Wenckebach]] periodicity''', is almost always a disease of the [[AV node]].

Mobitz I heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval on the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) on consecutive beats followed by a blocked P wave (i.e., a 'dropped' QRS complex).  After the dropped QRS complex, the PR interval resets and the cycle repeats.

One of the baseline assumptions when determining if an individual has Mobitz I heart block is that the atrial rhythm has to be regular.  If the atrial rhythm is not regular, there could be alternative explanations as to why certain P waves do not conduct to the ventricles.

This is almost always a benign condition for which no specific treatment is needed. In symptomatic cases, intravenous [[atropine]] or [[isoproterenol]] may transiently improve conduction.<ref>Lilly, L. S., Pathophysiology of Heart Disease. Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2007</ref>

In [[horses]] Mobitz I AV block is considered a normal variant finding, frequently encountered in relaxed, athletically fit animals.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=2t9BlUut8UwC&pg=PA276&lpg=PA276&dq=mobitz+horses | title = Cardiology of the horse | isbn = 978-0-7020-2240-1 | author1 = Marr | first1 = Celia M | date = 1999-07-12}}</ref>

===Type 2 (Mobitz II/Hay)===<!-- This section is linked from [[Atropine]] -->
'''Type 2 Second-degree AV block''', also known as "Mobitz II," is almost always a disease of the distal conduction system ([[electrical conduction system of the heart|His-Purkinje System]]).  

Mobitz II heart block is characterized on a surface [[ECG]] by intermittently nonconducted P waves not preceded by PR prolongation and not followed by PR shortening.  The medical significance of this type of AV block is that it may progress rapidly to [[complete heart block]], in which no [[escape rhythm]] may emerge.  In this case, the person may experience a [[Stokes-Adams attack]], [[cardiac arrest]], or [[Sudden Cardiac Death|sudden cardiac death]].  The definitive treatment for this form of AV Block is an [[implanted pacemaker]].

The impairment is usually below the AV node.<ref name="pmid8445186">{{cite journal |author=Wogan JM, Lowenstein SR, Gordon GS |title=Second-degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II |journal=J Emerg Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=47–54 |year=1993 |pmid=8445186 |doi= 10.1016/0736-4679(93)90009-V|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0736-4679(93)90009-V}}</ref> Although the terms '''infranodal block''' or '''infrahisian block''' are often applied to this disorder, they refer to the ''anatomic location'' of the block, whereas '''Mobitz II''' refers to an ''electrocardiographic pattern''.

== Symptoms ==
Most people with Wenckebach (Type I Mobitz) do not show symptoms. However, those that do usually display one or more of the following:
*Light-headedness
*Dizziness
*[[Syncope (medicine)|Syncope]] (Fainting)
