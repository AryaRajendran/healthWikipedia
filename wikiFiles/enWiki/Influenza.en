'''Influenza''', commonly known as "the '''flu'''", is an [[infectious disease]] of [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s caused by [[RNA virus]]es of the family [[Orthomyxoviridae]], the [[Orthomyxoviridae#Types of influenza virus|influenza viruses]].  The most common symptoms are [[chills]], [[fever]], [[rhinorrhea|runny nose]], [[sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], [[headache]] (often severe), [[cough]]ing, weakness/[[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[malaise|general discomfort]].<ref name=Merck>{{cite web

Typically, influenza is [[Airborne disease|transmitted through the air]] by coughs or sneezes, creating [[aerosols]] containing the virus. Influenza can also be transmitted by direct contact with bird droppings or [[mucus|nasal secretions]], or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Airborne aerosols have been thought to cause most infections, although which means of transmission is most important is not absolutely clear.<ref name=Brankston/> Influenza viruses can be inactivated by [[sunlight]], [[disinfectant]]s and [[detergent]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Suarez |first=D |coauthors=Spackman E, Senne D, Bulaga L, Welsch A, Froberg K |title=The effect of various disinfectants on detection of avian influenza virus by real time RT-PCR |journal=Avian Dis |volume=47 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1091–5 |year=2003 |pmid=14575118 |doi=10.1637/0005-2086-47.s3.1091}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)]: Implications for [[Disease|Human Disease]].

Influenza spreads around the world in [[flu season|seasonal epidemics]], resulting in about three to five million yearly cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 yearly deaths,<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/ Influenza (Seasonal)], [[World Health Organization]], April 2009. Retrieved 13 February 2010.</ref> rising to millions in some [[pandemic]] years. In the 20th century three [[influenza pandemic]]s occurred, each caused by the appearance of a new [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the virus in humans, and killed tens of millions of people. Often, new influenza strains appear when an existing flu virus spreads to humans from another animal [[species]], or when an existing human strain picks up new [[gene]]s from a virus that usually infects birds or pigs. An avian strain named [[H5N1]] raised the concern of a new influenza pandemic after it emerged in Asia in the 1990s, but it has not [[evolution|evolved]] to a form that spreads easily between people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Avian influenza ("bird flu") fact sheet |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/ |month=February | year=2006 |publisher=WHO |accessdate=20 October 2006}}</ref> In April 2009 a novel flu strain evolved that combined genes from human, pig, and bird flu.  Initially dubbed "swine flu" and also known as [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|influenza A/H1N1]], it emerged in Mexico, the United States, and several other nations. The [[World Health Organization]] officially declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 June 2009 (see [[2009 flu pandemic]]). The WHO's declaration of a pandemic level 6 was an indication of spread, not severity, the strain actually having a lower mortality rate than common flu outbreaks.<ref>World Health Organization.

Approximately 33% of people with influenza are asymptomatic.<ref name=AmericanJournalEpidemiology2008>[http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/167/7/775.full  Time Lines of Infection and Disease in Human Influenza: A Review of Volunteer Challenge Studies], ''American Journal of Epidemiology'', Carrat, Vergu, Ferguson, et al., ''167'' (7): 775–785, 2008.

Symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection. Usually the first symptoms are chills or a chilly sensation, but fever is also common early in the infection, with body temperatures ranging from 38–39&nbsp;°C (approximately 100–103&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suzuki E, Ichihara K, Johnson AM |title=Natural course of fever during influenza virus infection in children |journal=Clin Pediatr (Phila) |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=76–9 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17164515 |doi=10.1177/0009922806289588}}</ref> Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days, with aches and pains throughout their bodies, which are worse in their backs and legs.<ref name=Merck /> Symptoms of influenza may include:

It can be difficult to distinguish between the [[common cold]] and influenza in the early stages of these infections,<ref name=Eccles/> but a flu can be identified by a high fever with a sudden onset and extreme fatigue. Influenza is a mixture of symptoms of common cold and [[pneumonia]], body ache, headcahe, and fatigue.

Since [[antiviral drug]]s are effective in treating influenza if given early ([[#Treatment|see treatment section]], below), it can be important to identify cases early.

The available laboratory tests for influenza continue to improve.

The central core contains the viral [[RNA]] [[genome]] and other viral proteins that package and protect this RNA. RNA tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double.<ref name=Lamb/> Unusually for a virus, its genome is not a single piece of [[nucleic acid]]; instead, it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented [[negative-sense]] RNA, each piece of RNA containing either one or two [[gene]]s, which code for a gene product (protein).<ref name=Bouvier/> For example, the influenza A genome contains 11 genes on eight pieces of RNA, encoding for 11 [[protein]]s: [[hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]] (HA), [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]] (NA), [[Influenza virus nucleoprotein|nucleoprotein]] (NP), [[M1 protein|M1]], [[M2 protein|M2]], [[NS1 Influenza Protein|NS1]], NS2(NEP: nuclear export protein), PA, PB1 (polymerase basic 1), PB1-F2 and PB2.<ref name=Ghedin>{{cite journal |last=Ghedin |first=E | last2 = Sengamalay | first2 = NA | last3 = Shumway | first3 = M | last4 = Zaborsky | first4 = J | last5 = Feldblyum | first5 = T | last6 = Subbu | first6 = V | last7 = Spiro | first7 = DJ | last8 = Sitz | first8 = J | last9 = Koo | first9 = H |title=Large-scale sequencing of human influenza reveals the dynamic nature of viral genome evolution |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=437 |issue=7062 |pages=1162–6 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16208317|doi=10.1038/nature04239 | bibcode=2005Natur.437.1162G}}</ref>

Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two large glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles.

[[File:Virus Replication large.svg|thumb|Host cell invasion and replication by the influenza virus. The steps in this process are discussed in the text.]]

Viruses can replicate only in living cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith AE, Helenius A |title=How viruses enter animal cells|journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5668 |pages=237–42 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15073366 |doi=10.1126/science.1094823|bibcode = 2004Sci...304..237S }}</ref> Influenza infection and replication is a multi-step process: First, the virus has to bind to and enter the cell, then deliver its genome to a site where it can produce new copies of viral proteins and RNA, assemble these components into new viral particles, and, last, exit the host cell.<ref name=Bouvier>{{cite journal |author=Bouvier NM, [[Peter Palese|Palese P]] |title=The biology of influenza viruses|journal=Vaccine |volume=26 Suppl 4 |pages=D49–53 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=19230160 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.07.039|pmc=3074182}}</ref>

Influenza viruses bind through [[hemagglutinin]] onto [[sialic acid]] sugars on the surfaces of [[epithelium|epithelial cells]], typically in the nose, throat, and [[lung]]s of mammals, and [[intestine]]s of birds (Stage 1 in infection figure).<ref name=Wagner>{{cite journal|last=Wagner |first=R |coauthors=Matrosovich M, Klenk H |title=Functional balance between haemagglutinin and neuraminidase in influenza virus infections |journal=Rev Med Virol |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=159–66 |year=2002 |month=May–June|pmid=11987141 |doi=10.1002/rmv.352}}</ref> After the hemagglutinin is [[proteolysis|cleaved]] by a [[protease]], the cell imports the virus by [[endocytosis]].<ref name=Steinhauer>{{cite journal |author=Steinhauer DA |title=Role of hemagglutinin cleavage for the pathogenicity of influenza virus|journal=Virology |volume=258 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10329563 |doi=10.1006/viro.1999.9716}}</ref>

The intracellular details are still being elucidated. It is known that virions converge to the [[microtubule]] organizing center, interact with acidic endosomes and finally enter the target endosomes for genome release.<ref name=Liu2011>Liu SL, Zhang ZL, Tian ZQ, Zhao HS, Liu H, Sun EZ, Xiao GF, Zhang W, Wang HZ, Pang DW (2011) Effectively and efficiently dissecting the infection of influenza virus by quantum dot-based single-particle tracking. ACS Nano</ref>

Once inside the cell, the acidic conditions in the [[endosome]] cause two events to happen: First, part of the hemagglutinin protein fuses the [[viral envelope]] with the vacuole's membrane, then the M2 [[ion channel]] allows [[proton]]s to move through the viral envelope and acidify the core of the virus, which causes the core to dissemble and release the viral RNA and core proteins.<ref name=Bouvier/> The viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] are then released into the [[cytoplasm]] (Stage 2).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lakadamyali |first=M |coauthors=Rust M, Babcock H, Zhuang X |title=Visualizing infection of individual influenza viruses|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=16 |pages=9280–5 |year=2003 |month=5 August |pmid=12883000 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0832269100|pmc=170909|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9280L }}</ref> The M2 ion channel is blocked by [[amantadine]] drugs, preventing infection.<ref name=Pinto>{{cite journal |author=Pinto LH, Lamb RA |title=The M2 proton channels of influenza A and B viruses |journal=J.

These core proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the [[cell nucleus]], where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive-sense vRNA (Steps 3a and b).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cros |first=J |coauthors=Palese P|title=Trafficking of viral genomic RNA into and out of the nucleus: influenza, Thogoto and Borna disease viruses |journal=Virus Res|volume=95 |issue=1–2 |pages=3–12 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=12921991 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1702(03)00159-X}}</ref> The vRNA either is exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4) or remains in the nucleus. Newly synthesized viral proteins are either secreted through the [[Golgi apparatus]] onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular [[mRNA]] and using the released [[nucleotide]]s for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting [[translation (biology)|translation]] of host-cell mRNAs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kash |first=J |coauthors=Goodman A, Korth M, Katze M |title=Hijacking of the host-cell response and translational control during influenza virus infection |journal=Virus Res |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=111–20 |year=2006 |month=July|pmid=16630668 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2005.10.013}}</ref>

Negative-sense vRNAs that form the [[genome]]s of future viruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and [[Capsid|viral core]] proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid membrane]], acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nayak|first=D |coauthors=Hui E, Barman S |title=Assembly and budding of influenza virus |journal=Virus Res |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=147–65|year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15567494 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2004.08.012}}</ref> As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their [[neuraminidase]] has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell.<ref name=Wagner/> After the release of new influenza viruses, the host cell dies.

Because of the absence of RNA [[proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants; this causes [[antigenic drift]], which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Drake |first=J |title=Rates of spontaneous mutation among RNA viruses |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=90 |issue=9 |pages=4171–5 |year=1993 |month=1 May|pmid=8387212 |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.9.4171 |pmc=46468|bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.4171D }}</ref> The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or [[reassortment]] of vRNAs if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell. The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces [[antigenic shift]]s, which are sudden changes from one antigen to another. These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity.<ref name=Hilleman/> This is important in the emergence of pandemics, as discussed below in the section on [[#Epidemiology|Epidemiology]].

The mechanisms by which influenza infection causes symptoms in humans have been studied intensively. One of the mechanisms is believed to be the inhibition of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) resulting in lowered [[cortisol]] levels.<ref name=jefferies1998>{{cite journal |author=Jefferies WM, Turner JC, Lobo M, Gwaltney JM Jr |title=Low plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone in patients with acute influenza|journal=Clin Infect Dis. |volume= 26|issue=3 |pages=708–10 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/3/708.full.pdf |year=1998 |pmid=9524849 |pmc= |doi=10.1086/514594 |last4=Gwaltney}}</ref>

For instance, part of the process that allows influenza viruses to invade cells is the [[proteolysis|cleavage]] of the viral [[hemagglutinin]] protein by any one of several human [[protease]]s.<ref name=Steinhauer/> In mild and avirulent viruses, the structure of the hemagglutinin means that it can only be cleaved by proteases found in the throat and lungs, so these viruses cannot infect other tissues. However, in highly virulent strains, such as H5N1, the hemagglutinin can be cleaved by a wide variety of proteases, allowing the virus to spread throughout the body.<ref name=Korteweg/>

The viral hemagglutinin protein is responsible for determining both which species a strain can infect and where in the human [[respiratory tract]] a strain of influenza will bind.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nicholls JM, Chan RW, Russell RJ, Air GM, Peiris JS |title=Evolving complexities of influenza virus and its receptors |journal=Trends Microbiol. |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=149–57 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18375125 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2008.01.008}}</ref> Strains that are easily transmitted between people have hemagglutinin proteins that bind to receptors in the upper part of the respiratory tract, such as in the nose, throat and mouth.

Due to the high [[mutation rate]] of the virus, a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years. Every year, the World Health Organization predicts which strains of the virus are most likely to be circulating in the next year (see [[Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine]]), allowing [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains.<ref name=WHOrecommendation/> The vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains but does not include all the strains active in the world during that season. It takes about six months for the manufacturers to formulate and produce the millions of doses required to deal with the seasonal epidemics; occasionally, a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=E |coauthors=Ghedin E, Miller N, Taylor J, Bao Y, St George K, Grenfell B, Salzberg S, Fraser C, Lipman D, Taubenberger J |title=Whole-genome analysis of human influenza A virus reveals multiple persistent lineages and reassortment among recent H3N2 viruses |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e300 |year=2005 | month = September |pmid=16026181 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030300 |pmc=1180517}}</ref> It is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with the strain that the vaccine is supposed to prevent, as the vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective.<ref name=CDCkeyfacts/>

Vaccines can cause the [[immune system]] to react as if the body were actually being infected, and general infection symptoms (many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms) can appear, though these symptoms are usually not as severe or long-lasting as influenza. The most dangerous [[adverse effect]] is a severe [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to either the virus material itself or residues from the hen eggs used to grow the influenza; however, these reactions are extremely rare.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/flushot.htm Questions & Answers: Flu Shot] CDC publication updated 24 July 2006.

=== Antivirals ===
The two classes of antiviral drugs used against influenza are [[neuraminidase inhibitor]]s ([[oseltamivir]] and [[zanamivir]]) and [[M2 protein]] inhibitors ([[adamantane]] derivatives).

==== Neuraminidase inhibitors ====
[[Neuraminidase inhibitors]] include the antiviral medications [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) and [[zanamivir]] (Relenza).

== Prognosis ==

{{further2|[[Flu season]]}}
[[Image:Influenza Seasonal Risk Areas.svg|thumb|300px|Seasonal risk areas for influenza: November–April (blue), April–November (red), and year-round (yellow).]]
Influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter, and because the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]s have winter at different times of the year, there are actually two different flu seasons each year. This is why the World Health Organization (assisted by the [[National Influenza Centers]]) makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year; one for the Northern, and one for the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=WHOrecommendation>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2007northreport.pdf Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2006–2007 influenza season] WHO report 14 February 2006. Retrieved 19 October 2006.</ref>

A long-standing puzzle has been why outbreaks of the flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout the year. One possible explanation is that, because people are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person. Increased travel due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role.<ref name="NPR2003-12-17">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1551913 Weather and the Flu Season] NPR Day to Day, 17 December 2003. Retrieved, 19 October 2006</ref> Another factor is that cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucus, preventing the body from effectively expelling virus particles. The virus also survives longer on surfaces at colder temperatures and aerosol transmission of the virus is highest in cold environments (less than 5&nbsp;°C) with low relative humidity.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Influenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature | last1 = Lowen | first1 = AC | last2 = Mubareka | first2 = S | last3 = Steel | first3 = J | last4 = Palese | first4 = P | authorlink4 = Peter Palese | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | page = e151 | url = http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.0030151 | format = PDF | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151 | pmc = 2034399 | pmid = 17953482 | year = 2007 | month = October }}</ref> Indeed, the lower air humidity in winter seems to be the main cause of seasonal influenza transmission in temperate regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shaman J, Kohn M |title=Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality |journal=Proc.

[[File:Influenza geneticshift.svg|thumb|left|Antigenic shift, or reassortment, can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of human influenza]]
New influenza viruses are constantly [[evolution|evolving]] by [[mutation]] or by [[reassortment]].<ref name=hay/> Mutations can cause small changes in the [[hemagglutinin]] and [[neuraminidase]] [[antigen]]s on the surface of the virus. This is called [[antigenic drift]], which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to the pre-existing strains. This new variant then replaces the older strains as it rapidly sweeps through the human population, often causing an epidemic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolf, Yuri I|title=Long intervals of stasis punctuated by bursts of positive selection in the seasonal evolution of influenza A virus |journal=Biol Direct |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=34 |year=2006 |pmid=17067369|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-34 |first2=C |first3=EC |first4=EV |first5=DJ |pmc=1647279 |last2=Viboud |last3=Holmes |last4=Koonin |last5=Lipman}}</ref> However, since the strains produced by drift will still be reasonably similar to the older strains, some people will still be immune to them.

The 1918 flu pandemic (Spanish flu pandemic) was truly global, spreading even to the [[Arctic]] and remote [[Pacific Islands|Pacific islands]]. The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20% of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic [[mortality rate]] of 0.1%.<ref name=Taubenberger/><ref name=Knobler/> Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Simonsen |first=L |coauthors=Clarke M, Schonberger L, Arden N, Cox N, Fukuda K |title=Pandemic versus epidemic influenza mortality: a pattern of changing age distribution |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=178 |issue=1 |pages=53–60 |year=1998 |month=July |pmid=9652423}}</ref> This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918–1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that 2.5% to 5% of the world's population was killed. As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] has killed 25 million in its first 25 years.<ref name=Knobler/>

Later flu pandemics were not so devastating. They included the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] (type A, [[H2N2]] strain) and the 1968 [[Hong Kong Flu]] (type A, [[H3N2]] strain), but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people. In later pandemics [[antibiotic]]s were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to the Spanish Flu of 1918.<ref name=Taubenberger/>

The first influenza virus to be isolated was from poultry, when in 1901 the agent causing a disease called "fowl plague" was passed through [[Chamberland filter]]s, which have pores that are too small for [[bacteria]] to pass through.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heinen PP |url=http://www.vetscite.org/publish/articles/000041/print.html |title=Swine influenza: a zoonosis |journal=Veterinary Sciences Tomorrow |issn=1569-0830 |date=15 September 2003}}</ref> The [[etiology|etiological]] cause of influenza, the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses, was first discovered in [[pig]]s by [[Richard Shope]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shimizu |first=K |title=History of influenza epidemics and discovery of influenza virus |journal=Nippon Rinsho |year=1997 |month=October |volume=55 |issue=10|pages=2505–201 |pmid=9360364}}</ref> This discovery was shortly followed by the isolation of the virus from humans by a group headed by [[Patrick Laidlaw]] at the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] of [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] in 1933.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=W |coauthors=Andrewes CH, Laidlaw PP |title=A virus obtained from influenza patients |journal=Lancet |year=1933 |volume=2 |pages=66–68 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)78541-2 |issue=5732}}</ref> However, it was not until [[Wendell Stanley]] first crystallized [[tobacco mosaic virus]] in 1935 that the [[cell (biology)|non-cellular]] nature of viruses was appreciated.

The first significant step towards preventing influenza was the development in 1944 of a killed-virus vaccine for influenza by [[Thomas Francis, Jr.]]. This built on work by Australian [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]], who showed that the virus lost virulence when it was cultured in fertilized hen's eggs.<ref name="Nobel">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1960/burnet-bio.html Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet: Biography] The [[Nobel Foundation]].

Influenza produces [[variable cost|direct costs]] due to lost [[productivity]] and associated medical treatment, as well as [[indirect costs]] of preventative measures. In the United States, influenza is responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion per year, while it has been estimated that a future pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html Statement from President George W. Bush on Influenza] Retrieved 26 October 2006</ref> However, the economic impacts of past pandemics have not been intensively studied, and some authors have suggested that the [[Spanish flu|Spanish influenza]] actually had a positive long-term effect on per-capita income growth, despite a large reduction in the working population and severe short-term [[Recession|depressive]] effects.<ref>Brainerd, E. and M. Siegler (2003), "The Economic Effects of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic", ''CEPR Discussion Paper'', no. 3791.</ref> Other studies have attempted to predict the costs of a pandemic as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu on the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]], where 30% of all workers became ill, and 2.5% were killed. A 30% sickness rate and a three-week length of illness would decrease the [[gross domestic product]] by 5%. Additional costs would come from medical treatment of 18 million to 45 million people, and total economic costs would be approximately $700 billion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poland G |title=Vaccines against avian influenza—a race against time |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMe068047 | format = PDF |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=13 |pages=1411–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16571885 | doi=10.1056/NEJMe068047}}</ref>

Preventative costs are also high.

Research on influenza includes studies on [[molecular virology]], how the virus produces disease ([[pathogenesis]]), host [[immune response]]s, [[genomics|viral genomics]], and how the virus spreads ([[epidemiology]]). These studies help in developing influenza countermeasures; for example, a better understanding of the body's immune system response helps [[vaccine]] development, and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids the development of antiviral drugs. One important [[Research|basic research]] program is the [[Influenza Genome Sequencing Project]], which is creating a library of influenza sequences; this library should help clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another, which genes most affect [[immunogenicity]], and how the virus [[evolution|evolves]] over time.<ref>[http://msc.tigr.org/infl_a_virus/index.shtml Influenza A Virus Genome Project] at The Institute of Genomic Research.

Research into new vaccines is particularly important, as current vaccines are very slow and expensive to produce and must be reformulated every year. The sequencing of the influenza genome and [[recombinant DNA]] technology may accelerate the generation of new vaccine strains by allowing scientists to substitute new antigens into a previously developed vaccine strain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Subbarao K, Katz J |title=Influenza vaccines generated by reverse genetics |journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |volume=283 |issue=|pages=313–42 |year=2004|pmid=15298174}}</ref> New technologies are also being developed to grow viruses in [[cell culture]], which promises higher yields, less cost, better quality and surge capacity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bardiya N, Bae J |title=Influenza vaccines: recent advances in production technologies |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/jdt26gc39v4bwk9q/ |journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=299–305 |year=2005 |pmid=15660212 | doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1874-1}}</ref> Research on a universal influenza A vaccine, targeted against the external domain of the transmembrane viral [[M2 protein]] (M2e), is being done at the [[University of Ghent]] by [[Walter Fiers]], [[Xavier Saelens]] and their team<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neirynck S, Deroo T, Saelens X, Vanlandschoot P, Jou WM, Fiers W |title=A universal influenza A vaccine based on the extracellular domain of the M2 protein |journal=Nat.

A number of [[biologic medical product|biologics]], therapeutic vaccines and immunobiologics are also being investigated for treatment of infection caused by viruses. Therapeutic biologics are designed to activate the immune response to virus or antigens. Typically, biologics do not target [[metabolic pathway]]s like anti-viral drugs, but stimulate immune cells such as [[lymphocytes]], [[macrophages]], and/or [[antigen presenting cell]]s, in an effort to drive an immune response towards a [[cytotoxic]] effect against the virus. Influenza models, such as murine influenza, are convenient models to test the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic biologics. For example, [[Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator]] inhibits viral growth in the murine model of influenza.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator: Review of the ImmunoPharmacology of a new Veterinary Biologic |journal=Journal of Applied Research in Veterinary Medicine |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=61–68 | url=http://jarvm.com/articles/Vol6Iss2/Vol6Iss2Gingerich61-68.pdf |format=PDF | accessdate=5 December 2010 |author=Gingerich, DA }}</ref>

At present, HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease, and there is no evidence suggesting efficient human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1).

In March 2013, the Chinese government reported three cases of H7N9 influenza infections in humans. Two of whom had died and the third was critically ill.  Although the strain of the virus is not thought to spread efficiently between humans, <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/world/asia/lesser-known-strain-of-bird-flu-kills-2-in-china.html?_r=0 2 Men in China Die of Lesser-Known Strain of Bird Flu], New York Times, DAVID BARBOZA, March 31, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_04_01/en/index.html H7N9 avian influenza human infections in China], World Health Organization, April 1, 2013.  " . . So far no further cases have been identified among the 88 identified contacts under follow up. . "</ref>  by mid-April, at least 82 persons had become ill from H7N9, of which 17 had died.  These cases include three small family clusters in Shanghai and one cluster between a neighboring girl and boy in Beijing, raising at least the possibility of human-to-human transmission.  WHO points out that one cluster did not have two of the cases lab confirmed and further points out, as a matter of baseline information, that some viruses are able to cause limited human-to-human transmission under conditions of close contact but are not transmissible enough to cause large community outbreaks.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/bird-flu-spreads-china-unclear/story?id=18987118 Deadly Bird Flu Spreading in China, Unclear How], ABC News, Katie Moisse, April 18, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/latest_update_h7n9/en/index.html Background and summary of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus– as of 5 April 2013], World Health Organization.</ref>

In 2009, a swine-origin [[H1N1]] virus strain commonly referred to as "swine flu" caused the [[2009 flu pandemic]], but there is no evidence that it is endemic to pigs (i.e. actually a swine flu) or of transmission from pigs to people, instead the virus is spreading from person to person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oie.int/eng/press/en_090427.htm|title=Press Release: A/H1N1 influenza like human illness in Mexico and the USA: OIE statement|author=Maria Zampaglione |publisher=[[World Organisation for Animal Health]] |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=29 April 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090430105521/http://www.oie.int/eng/press/en_090427.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=30 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/health/01name.html |title=W.H.O.
