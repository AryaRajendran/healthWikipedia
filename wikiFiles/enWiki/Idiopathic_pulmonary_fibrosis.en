By definition, the term is used only when the cause of the [[pulmonary fibrosis]] is unknown ("[[idiopathic]]"). 

Microscopically, lung tissue from patients shows a characteristic set of histologic/pathologic features known as [[usual interstitial pneumonia]] (UIP).

==Incidence==
In the UK IPF kills about 5,000 people every year<ref name="pmid21525528">{{cite journal | author = Navaratnam V, Fleming KM, West J, Smith CJ, Jenkins RG, Fogarty A, Hubbard RB | title = The rising incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the U.K | journal = Thorax | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 462–7 | year = 2011 | month = June | pmid = 21525528 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2010.148031 }}</ref> (more than leukemia or ovarian cancer).<ref name=DM2011/>
Some well known cases of IPF:
* [[Evel Knievel]], legendary stuntman
* [[Steve Gerber]], co-creator of the satiric [[comic book]] character [[Howard the Duck]]

==Etiology==
Despite extensive investigation, the cause of IPF remains unknown. The condition involves abnormal and excessive deposition of collagen ([[fibrosis]]) in the pulmonary interstitium (mainly the walls of the alveoli) with minimal associated [[inflammation]].<ref name="Selman">{{cite journal | author = Selman M, King TE, Pardo A | title = Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: prevailing and evolving hypotheses about its pathogenesis and implications for therapy | journal = Ann.

Genetic associations include ''[[SFTPA1]]'', ''[[SFTPA2]]'', ''[[TERT]]'', and ''[[Telomerase RNA component|TERC]]''.<ref>{{OMIM|178500}}</ref>

==Classification==
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is one specific presentation of [[idiopathic interstitial pneumonia]] (IIP),  which is in turn a type of ''[[interstitial lung disease]]''.<ref name=ATS2>{{cite journal | author = | title = American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society International Multidisciplinary Consensus Classification of the Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias. This joint statement of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) was adopted by the ATS board of directors, June 2001 and by the ERS Executive Committee, June 2001 | journal = Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. | volume = 165 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–304 | year = 2002 | month = January | pmid = 11790668 | doi = }}</ref>
Other forms of "idiopathic interstitial pneumonias" include non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). Examples of known causes of interstitial lung disease include hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, asbestosis and collagen vascular diseases such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis.

==Clinical features==

IPF affects both genders and is usually encountered in patients greater than 50 years of age. However there is a notable reported case of a young adult has been diagnosed with IPF.<ref name="CBC juvenile lung failure">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2011/12/07/ottawa-lung-transplant-wait.html | work=CBC News | title=Barrhaven woman awaits transplant after lung failure | date=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="YOR juvenile lung failure">[http://www.yourottawaregion.com/news/local/article/1265240--barrhaven-community-rallies-behind-women-in-need-of-lung-transplant]</ref>   There are many different statements about average survival time following first diagnosis.  
Symptoms are gradual in onset. The most common are progressive [[dyspnea]] (difficulty breathing), but also include dry [[cough]], [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] (a disfigurement of the fingers), and rales (a crackling sound in the lungs during inhalation, heard with a stethoscope).<ref name=ATS2/>  It should be noted that these features are not specific for IPF and can occur in a wide variety of other pulmonary disorders.

==Differential diagnosis==
The key issue facing clinicians is whether the presenting [[Medical history|history]], symptoms (or signs), radiology, and [[Lung function test|pulmonary function testing]] are collectively in keeping with the diagnosis of IPF (which carries the poor prognosis described below) or whether the findings are due to another process.  It has long been recognized that patients with interstitial lung disease related to [[asbestos]] exposure, [[drug]]s (such as [[chemotherapeutic]] agents or [[nitrofurantoin]]), [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[scleroderma]]/[[systemic sclerosis]] may be difficult to distinguish from IPF.  Other differential diagnostic considerations include interstitial lung disease related to [[mixed connective tissue disease]], advanced sarcoidosis, chronic [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], pulmonary [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] and radiation-induced fibrosis.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis requires clinical findings compatible with interstitial lung disease in combination with either characteristic radiologic findings or a pathologic diagnosis of UIP on surgical lung [[biopsy]].  Generally, lung biopsy is only undertaken when its risks are outweighed by the potential benefits of identifying an alternative, treatable disease process. Establishing the diagnosis of IPF without a lung biopsy has been shown to be reliable when expert clinicians and radiologists concur that the presenting features are typical of IPF.<ref name="pmid15256390">{{cite journal | author = Flaherty KR, King TE, Raghu G, Lynch JP, Colby TV, Travis WD, Gross BH, Kazerooni EA, Toews GB, Long Q, Murray S, Lama VN, Gay SE, Martinez FJ | title = Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia: what is the effect of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis? | journal = Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. | volume = 170 | issue = 8 | pages = 904–10 | year = 2004 | month = October | pmid = 15256390 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200402-147OC }}</ref>  Based on this evidence, the 2002 ATS/ERS Multidisciplinary Consensus Statement on the Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias proposed the following criteria for establishing the diagnosis of IPF without a lung biopsy:<ref name=ATS2/>

Major criteria (all 4 required):
* Exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (drugs, exposures, connective tissue diseases)
* Abnormal [[pulmonary function test]]s with evidence of restriction (reduced [[vital capacity]]) and impaired gas exchange (pO<sub>2</sub>, p(A-a)O<sub>2</sub>, [[DLCO]])
* Bibasilar reticular abnormalities with minimal ground glass on high-resolution CT scans
* Transbronchial lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing no features to support an alternative diagnosis

Minor criteria (3 of 4 required):
* Age > 50
* Insidious onset of otherwise unexplained exertional dyspnea
* Duration of illness > 3 months
* Bibasilar inspiratory crackles

===Radiology===
Plain [[chest x-ray]]s reveal decreased [[lung volumes]], typically with prominent [[reticular interstitial marking]]s near the lung bases. [[Honeycombing]], a pattern of lung fibrosis characterized by multiple cystic spaces located at the bases of the lungs, is frequently seen in advanced cases.  In less severe cases, these changes may not be evident on a plain chest film.

High-resolution [[Computerized tomography|CT scan]]s of the chest demonstrate [[fibrosis|fibrotic]] changes in both lungs, with a predilection for the bases and the periphery. The most characteristic radiologic feature of IPF is honeycombing, often described as [[traction bronchiectasis]]. There may be [[ground glass opacities]] of the lungs, but these changes are relatively minor in comparison with the fibrotic changes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Webb |first=W. Richard |coauthors=Nestor L. Müller and David P. Naidich |title=High-resolution CT of the lung |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7817-2278-0 |page=196}}</ref>

===Pulmonary function tests===
[[Spirometry]] classically reveals a reduction in the vital capacity with either a proportionate reduction in airflows, or increased airflows for the observed vital capacity.  The latter finding reflects the increased lung stiffness (reduced lung compliance) associated with pulmonary fibrosis, which leads to increased lung elastic recoil.<ref name="pmid16264058">{{cite journal | author = Pellegrino R, Viegi G, Brusasco V, Crapo RO, Burgos F, Casaburi R, Coates A, van der Grinten CP, Gustafsson P, Hankinson J, Jensen R, Johnson DC, MacIntyre N, McKay R, Miller MR, Navajas D, Pedersen OF, Wanger J | title = Interpretative strategies for lung function tests | journal = Eur. Respir. J. | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–68 | year = 2005 | month = November | pmid = 16264058 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.05.00035205 }}</ref>

Measurement of static lung volumes using [[body plethysmography]] or other techniques typically reveals reduced lung volumes (restriction).  This reflects the difficulty encountered in inflating the fibrotic lungs.  

The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is invariably reduced in IPF and may be the only abnormality in mild or early disease.  Its impairment underlies the propensity of patients with IPF to exhibit oxygen desaturation with exercise.

==Histology/Pathology==

[[Histology|Histologic]] specimens for the diagnosis of IPF must be large enough that the pathologist can comment on the underlying lung architecture.  Small biopsies, such as those obtained via transbronchial lung biopsy (performed during [[bronchoscopy]]) are usually not sufficient for this purpose.  Hence, larger biopsies obtained surgically via a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy are usually necessary.<ref name=ATS2/>

The histological appearance associated with IPF is referred to as [[usual interstitial pneumonia]] (UIP). Although a pathologic diagnosis of UIP often corresponds to a clinical diagnosis of IPF, it can be seen in other diseases as well.<ref>{{cite book |title=Robbins and Cotran's Pathological Basis of Disease |edition=7th |first=Vinay |last=Kumar |coauthors=Nelso Fausto and Abul Abbas |year=2005 |publisher=Saunders |isbn=978-0-7216-0187-8 |page=729}}</ref>  Key features of UIP include interstitial fibrosis in a "patchwork pattern", interstitial scarring, honeycomb changes and fibroblast foci. There is usually only a relatively mild or minor component of interstitial chronic inflammation.<ref name=ATS2/>

==Treatment==
As of 2006, there was no consensus on treatment nor satisfactory treatment.<ref name="Walter">{{cite journal | author = Walter N, Collard HR, King TE | title = Current perspectives on the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis | journal = Proc Am Thorac Soc | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 330–8 | year = 2006 | month = June | pmid = 16738197 | doi = 10.1513/pats.200602-016TK }}</ref>

A 2010 Cochrane analysis found that pirfenidone significantly improved progression-free survival.<ref name=Cochrane>{{cite journal | author = Spagnolo P, Del Giovane C, Luppi F, Cerri S, Balduzzi S, Walters EH, D'Amico R, Richeldi L | title = Non-steroid agents for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 9 | pages = CD003134 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20824834 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003134.pub2 | url = }}</ref>  In 2011, [[pirfenidone]] was approved for use in Europe under the brand name Esbriet.

There is a lack of large, randomized placebo-controlled trials of therapy for IPF. Moreover, many of the earlier studies were based on the hypothesis that IPF is an inflammatory disorder, and hence studied anti-inflammatory agents such as [[corticosteroids]]. Another problem has been that studies conducted prior to the more recent classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias failed to distinguish IPF/UIP from NSIP in particular. Hence, many patients with arguably more steroid-responsive diseases were included in earlier studies, confounding the interpretation of their results.<ref name="Selman"/>

A large randomized, controlled trial (PANTHER-IPF) found that the combination of [[prednisone]], [[azathioprine]], and [[N-acetylcysteine]] had a significantly higher death rate than placebo (8 vs. 1), and the trial was terminated.<ref name="pmid22607134">{{cite journal | author = Raghu G, Anstrom KJ, King TE, Lasky JA, Martinez FJ | title = Prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine for pulmonary fibrosis | journal = N.

Other treatments studied have included [[interferon gamma]]-1b, the antifibrotic agent pirfenidone, and [[bosentan]]. [[Bosentan]] are currently being studied in patients with IPF while [[interferon gamma]]-1b is no longer considered a viable treatment option. Finally, the addition of the [[antioxidant]] [[N-acetylcysteine]] to prednisone and azathioprine produced a slight benefit in terms of FVC and DLCO over 12 months of follow up. However, the major benefit appeared to be prevention of the myelotoxicity associated with azathioprine.<ref name="pmid16306520">{{cite journal | author = Demedts M, Behr J, Buhl R, Costabel U, Dekhuijzen R, Jansen HM, MacNee W, Thomeer M, Wallaert B, Laurent F, Nicholson AG, Verbeken EK, Verschakelen J, Flower CD, Capron F, Petruzzelli S, De Vuyst P, van den Bosch JM, Rodriguez-Becerra E, Corvasce G, Lankhorst I, Sardina M, Montanari M | title = High-dose acetylcysteine in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis | journal = N.
