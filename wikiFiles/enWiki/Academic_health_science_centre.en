An '''academic health science(s) centre''' ('''AHSC'''; also known as an '''academic health science(s) system''', an '''academic health science(s) partnership''' or an '''academic medical centre''') is a partnership between one or more universities and healthcare providers focusing on research, clinical services, education and training.<ref name=lancet1>{{cite news|url=http://ahsc-ntf.org/docs/AHSCs/Reports/Dzauetal2010Lancet.pdf|title=The role of academic health science systems in the transformation of medicine|accessdate=6 November 2010|publisher=The Lancet|date=13 March 2010}}</ref> AHSCs are intended to ensure that medical research breakthroughs lead to direct clinical benefits for patients.<ref name=lancet1/> The organisational structures that comprise an AHSC can take a variety of forms, ranging from simple partnerships to, less frequently, fully integrated organisations with a single management board.<ref name=lancet1/>
