'''''Clonorchis sinensis''''', the Chinese liver fluke, is a human [[liver fluke]] in the class [[Trematoda]], Phylum [[Platyhelminthes]]. This [[parasite]] lives in the [[liver]] of humans, and is found mainly in the common [[bile duct]] and [[gall bladder]], feeding on [[bile]]. These animals, which are believed to be the third most prevalent worm parasite in the world, are endemic to [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Southeast Asia]], currently infecting an estimated 30,000,000 humans.

== Life cycle ==
[[File:Clonorchis sinensis 2.png|left|thumb|An adult ''Clonorchis sinensis'' has these main body parts: oral sucker, pharynx, caecum, ventral sucker, vitellaria, uterus, ovary, [[Mehlis' gland]], testes, exretory bladder.]]

[[File:Clonorchis sinensis LifeCycle.gif|thumb|Life cycle of ''Clonorchis sinensis'']]
The egg of a ''Clonorchis sinensis'' (commonly: human [[liver fluke]]), which contains the miracidium that develops into the adult form, floats in freshwater until it is eaten by a snail.

=== First intermediate host ===
[[Freshwater snail]] ''[[Parafossarulus manchouricus]]'' - synonym: ''Parafossarulus striatulus'', often serves as a first [[intermediate host]] for ''Clonorchis sinensis'' in China, Japan, Korea and Russia.<ref>[http://atlas.or.kr/atlas/alphabet_view.php?my_codeName=Clonorchis%20sinensis ''Clonorchis sinensis'']. Web Atlas of Medical Pathology, accessed 1 April 2009</ref><ref name="WHO 1995">[[World Health Organization]] (1995). ''Control of Foodborne Trematode Infection''. WHO Technical Report Series. 849.

Once inside of the snail body, the miracidium hatches from the egg, and parasitically grows inside of the snail. The miracidium develops into a sporocyst, which in turn house the [[asexual reproduction]] of redia, the next stage. The redia themselves house the asexual reproduction of free-swimming cercaria. This system of asexual reproduction allows for an exponential multiplication of cercaria individuals from one miracidium. This aids the ''Clonorchis'' in reproduction, because it enables the miracidium to capitalize on one chance occasion of passively being eaten by a snail before the egg dies.

Once the redia mature, having grown inside the snail body until this point, they actively bore out of the snail body into the freshwater environment.

=== Second intermediate host ===
There, instead of waiting to be consumed by a host (as is the case in their egg stage), they seek out a fish. Boring their way into the fish's body, they again become parasites of their new hosts.

Once inside of the fish muscle, the cercaria create a protective metacercarial cyst with which to encapsulate their bodies. This protective cyst proves useful when the fish muscle is consumed by a human.

=== Definitive host ===
The acid-resistant cyst enables the metacercaria to avoid being digested by the human gastric acids, and allows the metacercaria to reach the [[small intestine]] unharmed. Reaching the small intestines, the metacercaria navigate toward the human liver, which becomes its final habitat. ''Clonorchis'' feed on human [[bile]] created by the [[liver]]. In the human liver, the mature ''Clonorchis'' reaches its stage of [[asexual reproduction]] which they produce eggs every 1â€“30 seconds.

== Effects on human health ==
{{Main|Clonorchiasis}}

Dwelling in the bile ducts, ''Clonorchis'' induces an inflammatory reaction, epithelial [[hyperplasia]] and sometimes even [[cholangiocarcinoma]], the incidence of which is raised in fluke-infested areas.<ref>Kumar et al.: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease 7E</ref>

One adverse effect of ''Clonorchis'' is the possibility for the adult metacercaria to consume all bile created in the liver, which would inhibit the host human from digesting, especially fats. Another possibility is obstruction of the [[bile duct]] by the parasite or its eggs, leading to biliary obstruction and [[cholangitis]] (specifically oriental cholangitis).

''Central Serous Retinopathy'' (CSR) a report of 80 cases by Dr. John Chiao-nan Chang, M.D. and Dr. Yin-Ping Wang, M.D. Hong Kong on page 125 of their report observed that 19% of the cases of CSR in their sample tested positive for ''Clonorchis sinensis''.<ref>[http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/20/2000061.pdf Report Text]</ref>

=== Symptoms ===
While normally asymptomatic most pathological manifestations result from inflammation and intermittent obstruction of the biliary ducts.  The acute phase consists of abdominal pain with associated nausea and diarrhea.  Long standing infections consist of fatigue, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and jaundice.  The pathology of long standing infections consist of bile stasis, obstruction, bacterial infections, inflammation, periductal fibrosis, and hyperplasia.  Development of [[cholangiocarcinoma]] is progressive.<ref>Dr. Kuo, O. Sinensis Lecture, ATSU School of Osteopathic Medicine Arizona, June 2012</ref>

=== Diagnosis and treatment ===
Infection is detected mainly on identification of eggs by [[microscopy|microscopic demonstration]] in [[faeces]] or in [[duodenum|duodenal]] aspirate. But other sophisticated methods have been developed such as [[ELISA]] which has become the most important clinical technique. Diagnosis by detecting DNAs from eggs in faeces are also developed using [[PCR]], real-time PCR, and [[Loop-mediated isothermal amplification|LAMP]], which are highly sensitive and specific. Imaging diagnosis has been studied in depth and is now widely used.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Huang SY, Zhao GH, Fu BQ, Xu MJ, Wang CR, Wu SM, Zou FC, Zhu XQ|year=2012|title=Genomics and molecular genetics of ''Clonorchis sinensis'': current status and perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383576911000778 | journal= Parasitology International|volume=61|issue=1|pages=71-76|pmid=21741496|doi=10.1016/j.parint.2011.06.008}}</ref><ref name=hong>{{cite journal |author= Hong ST, Fang Y|year=2012|title=''Clonorchis sinensis'' and clonorchiasis, an update|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383576911000766 | journal= Parasitology International|volume=61|issue=1|pages=17-24|pmid= 21704726|doi=10.1016/j.parint.2011.06.007}}</ref> Drugs used to treat infestation include [[triclabendazole]], [[praziquantel]], [[bithionol]], [[albendazole]], [[levamisole]] and [[mebendazole]].However, [[benzimidazoles]] are very weak as [[vermicide]].
