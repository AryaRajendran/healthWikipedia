'''Korsakoff's syndrome''' (also called '''Korsakoff's dementia''', '''Korsakoff's psychosis''', or '''amnesic-confabulatory syndrome''') is a neurological disorder caused by a lack of [[thiamine|thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>)]] in the [[brain]]. Its onset is linked to chronic alcohol abuse and/or severe malnutrition. The [[syndrome]] is named after [[Sergei Korsakoff]], a Russian [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrist]] who described it during the late 19th century.

==Signs and symptoms==
There are six major symptoms of Korsakoff's syndrome:
# [[anterograde amnesia]]
# [[retrograde amnesia]], severe memory loss
# [[confabulation]], that is, invented memories which are then taken as true due to gaps in memory sometimes associated with [[Blackout (Alcohol Related Amnesia)|blackouts]]
# meager content in [[conversation]]
# lack of [[insight]]
# [[apathy]] - the patients lose interest in things quickly and generally appear indifferent to change.

These symptoms are caused by a deficiency of [[thiamine|thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>)]], which is thought to cause damage to the [[medial]] [[thalamus]] and [[mammillary bodies]] of the hypothalamus as well as generalized [[cerebral atrophy]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kolb, Bryan; Whishaw, Ian Q. |title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2003 |page=473 |isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1 |oclc=55617319}}</ref> These brain regions are all parts of the limbic system, which is heavily in involved in emotion and memory.

When [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]] accompanies Korsakoff's syndrome, the combination is called the [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]]. Korsakoff's is a continuum of Wernicke's encephalopathy, though a recognised episode of Wernicke's is not always obvious.

Korsakoff's involves [[neuronal loss]], that is, damage to [[neurons]]; [[gliosis]] which is a result of damage to supporting cells of the [[central nervous system]]; and [[hemorrhage]] or bleeding in [[mammillary body|mammillary bodies]]. Damage to the [[dorsomedial nucleus]] or [[anterior group]] of the [[thalamus]] (limbic-specific nuclei) is also associated with this disorder. Cortical dysfunction may have arisen from thiamine deficiency, alcohol neurotoxicity, and/ or structural damage in the diencephalon.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Paller |first=K. A. |last2=Acharya |first2=A. |year=1997 |title=Functional neuroimaging of cortical dysfunction in alcoholic Korsakoff’s syndrome |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=277–293 |pmid= |doi=10.1162/jocn.1997.9.2.277 }}</ref>

Originally it was thought that a lack of initiative and a flat affect were important characteristics of emotion. Studies have questioned this, proposing that it is not necessarily a symptom of Korsakoff’s. Research suggesting that Korsakoff patients are emotionally unimpaired has made this a controversial topic. It can be argued that apathy, which usually characterizes Korsakoff patients, reflects a deficit of emotional expressions, without affecting the experience or perception of emotion.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Doulas |first=J. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=D. A. |year=1993 |title=Evidence of normal emotional responsiveness in alcoholic Korsakoff’s syndrome in the presence of profound memory impairment |journal=Addiction |volume=88 |issue=12 |pages=1637–1645 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb02038.x |pmid=8130702 }}</ref>

Research has also suggested that Korsakoff patients have impaired executive functions, which can lead to behavioral problems and interfere with daily activities. It is unclear however, which executive functions are affected most.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kessels |first=R. P. C. |last2=Van Oort |first2=R. |year=2009 |title=Executive dysfunction in Korsakoff’s syndrome: time to revise the DSM criteria for alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder? |journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=78–81 |doi=10.1080/13651500802308290 }}</ref>

At first it was thought that Korsakoff patients used confabulation to fill in memory gaps. However, it has been found that confabulation and amnesia do not necessarily co-occur. Studies have shown that there is dissociation between provoked confabulation, spontaneous confabulation (which is unprovoked) and false memories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kessels |first=R. P. C. |last2=Kortrijk |first2=H. E. |last3=Wester |first3=A. J. |last4=Nys |first4=G. M. S. |year=2008 |title=Confabulation behavior and false memories in Korsakoff’s syndrome: Role of source memory and executive functioning |journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=62 |issue= |pages=220–225 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2008.01758.x }}</ref> That is, patients could be led to believe certain things that haven’t happened, just like people without Korsakoff’s syndrome.

Signs include:
* [[Apathy]]
* [[Ataxia]]
* [[Coma]]
* [[Confabulation]]
* [[Paralysis]] of muscles controlling the eye
* [[Retrograde amnesia|Retrograde]] and [[anterograde amnesia]]
* [[Tremor]]
* [[Anosognosia]] - Lack of insight to or awareness of the condition

==Causes==
Conditions resulting in the vitamin deficiency and its effects include chronic [[alcoholism]] and severe [[malnutrition]]. Alcoholism may be an indicator of poor nutrition, which in addition to [[inflammation]] of the stomach lining, causes thiamine deficiency.<ref>{{cite web

PET scans show that there is a decrease of glucose metabolism in the frontal, parietal and cingulated regions of the brain in Korsakoff patients. This may contribute to memory loss / amnesia. Structural neuroimaging has also shown the presence of midline diencephalic lesions and cortical atrophy.<ref>Paller, K. A. & Acharya, A. (1997).

===Risk factors===
A number of factors may increase a person's risk to develop Korsakoff's syndrome. These factors are often related to patients' general health and their food intake habits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://psych.med.nyu.edu/conditions-we-treat/conditions/korsakoffs-syndrome | title=Korsakoff's Syndrome | publisher=NYU Langone Medical Center | date=Last reviewed March 2011 | accessdate=February 12, 2012 | author=Rosenblum, Laurie B.}}</ref>

*Chemotherapy
*Dialysis
*Extreme dieting
*Age
*Genetic factors

The prevalence varies from country to country, but is estimated to be between 0-3% of the population.<ref>Harper, C., Gold, J., Rodriguez, M., Perides, M. (1989). The prevalence of the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in Sydney, Australia: a prospective necropsy study. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 52 (2), 282-285.</ref>

==Treatment==
It was once assumed that anyone suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome would eventually need full time care. This is still often the case, but rehabilitation can help regain some, often limited, level of independence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kopelman MD, Thomson AD, Guerrini I, Marshall EJ |title=The Korsakoff syndrome: clinical aspects, psychology and treatment |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=148–54 |year=2009 |pmid=19151162 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn118}}</ref> Treatment involves the replacement or supplementation of [[thiamine]] by [[intravenous]] (IV) or [[intramuscular]] (IM) injection, together with proper [[nutrition]] and [[Rehydration|hydration]]. However, the amnesia and brain damage caused by the disease does not always respond to [[thiamine]] replacement therapy. In some cases, [[drug therapy]] is recommended. Treatment of the patient requires taking thiamine orally for 3 to 12 months, though only about 20 percent of the cases are reversible. If treatment is successful, improvement will become apparent within two years although recovery is slow and often incomplete.

Treatment for the memory aspect of Korsakoff’s syndrome can also include [[domain-specific learning]], which when used for rehabilitation is called the [[method of vanishing cues]]. Such treatments aim to use patients’ intact memory processes as the basis for rehabilitation. Patients who used the method of vanishing cues in therapy were found to learn and retain information more easily.<ref>Komatsu, S., Mimura, M., Kato, M., Wakamatsu, N. & Kashima, H. “Errorless and effortful processes involved in the learning of face-name associations by patients with alcoholic Korsakoff’s Syndrome.” (2000). Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 10(2), 113-132. doi: 10.1080/096020100389200</ref>

==Prevention==
The most effective method of preventing Korsakoff's syndrome is to avoid B vitamin/thiamine deficiency. In Western nations, the most common causes of such a deficiency are alcoholism and weight disorders.  Thus, requiring companies that sell alcoholic beverages to supplement them with B vitamin/thiamine would avert many cases of Korsakoff's.

==Case studies==
A famous case study is recounted by [[Oliver Sacks]] in "The Lost Mariner" and "A Matter of Identity", which can be found in ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]''. Other cases include German entertainer [[Harald Juhnke]], artist [[Charles Blackman]],<ref>{{cite news
