'''Delayed Auditory Feedback''' (DAF), is a device that enables a user of the device to speak into a [[microphone]] and then hear his or her voice in [[headphones]] a fraction of a second later. Some DAF devices are hardware; DAF [[computer software]] is also available.

DAF usage (with a 175 millisecond delay) has been shown to induce [[mental stress]].<ref name="number-11">

[[Electronic fluency devices]] use delayed auditory feedback and have been used as a technique to aid with [[stuttering]].

Delayed auditory feedback devices are used for example in [[speech perception]] experiments, in order to demonstrate the importance of [[auditory feedback]] in [[speech perception]] as well as in [[speech production]] (see e.g. Perkell et al. 1997<ref name="number-15">
