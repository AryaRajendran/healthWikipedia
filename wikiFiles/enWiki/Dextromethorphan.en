'''Dextromethorphan''' ('''DXM''' or '''DM''') is an [[antitussive]] (cough suppressant) [[drug]]. It is one of the active ingredients in many [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[common cold|cold]] and [[cough]] medicines, including [[generic drug|generic]] labels and [[store brand]]s, or Mucinex DM, [[Robitussin]], [[NyQuil]], [[Dimetapp]], [[Vicks]], [[Coricidin]], [[Delsym]], [[TheraFlu]], and others. Dextromethorphan has also found other uses in medicine, ranging from [[pain relief]] to [[psychological]] applications. It is sold in syrup, tablet, spray, and [[throat lozenge|lozenge]] forms. In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder.<ref name="urlReference Tables: Description and Solubility - D">{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmacopeia.cn/v29240/usp29nf24s0_alpha-2-13.html | title = Reference Tables: Description and Solubility - D | author = | coauthors = | date = | work = | publisher = | pages = | accessdate = 2011-05-06}}</ref>

DXM is also used recreationally. When exceeding label-specified maximum dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a [[dissociative]] [[hallucinogen]].

== Medical use ==
The primary use of dextromethorphan is as a [[cough suppressant]], for the temporary relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (such as commonly accompanies the [[influenza|flu]] and [[common cold]]), as well as those resulting from inhaled particle irritants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== Recreational use==
[[Image:DXM Doses.jpg|thumb|Dextromethorphan gel capsules]]
{{Main|Recreational use of dextromethorphan}}

Since their introduction, [[Over-the-counter substance|over-the-counter]] preparations containing dextromethorphan have been used in manners inconsistent with their labeling, often as a recreational drug.<ref name="cesar" /> At doses much higher than medically recommended, dextromethorphan is classified as a [[dissociative drug|dissociative]] [[hallucinogenic drug|hallucinogen]], possessing certain effects that are somewhat similar to the dissociative agents [[ketamine]] and [[phencyclidine]]. It may produce distortions of the visual field - feelings of [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], distorted bodily perception, and excitement, as well as a loss of sense of time. Some users report stimulant-like [[euphoria]], particularly in response to music. Dextromethorphan usually provides its recreational effects in a non-linear fashion, so that they are experienced in significantly varied stages. These 5 stages are commonly referred to as "plateaus". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml |title=The DXM Experience |first=William |last=White |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>AJ Giannini.

== Adverse effects ==
Side-effects of dextromethorphan use can include:<ref name="nhtsa">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/PEOPLE/injury/research/job185drugs/dextromethorphan.htm|title=Dextromethorphan|work=NHTSA}}</ref>

At normal doses:
* body [[rash]]/[[itching]] (see below)
* [[nausea]]
* [[drowsiness]]
* [[dizziness]]
* [[Closed-eye hallucination]]
* [[Difficulty breathing]]

At dosages 12.5 to 75 times the recommended therapeutic dose:
* [[hallucinations]]
* [[dissociation]]
* [[vomiting]]
* blurred vision and/or [[Diplopia|double vision]]
* bloodshot eyes
* [[dilated pupils]]
* [[sweating]]
* [[fever]]
* [[bruxia]]
* [[hypotension]]
* shallow [[Respiratory system|respiration]]
* [[diarrhea]]
* [[urinary retention]]
* [[muscle spasms]]
* [[Sedation]]

Dextromethorphan can also cause other gastrointestinal disturbances. Dextromethorphan had been thought to cause [[Olney's Lesions]] when administered [[intravenously]]; however, this was later proven inconclusive, due to lack of research on humans. Tests were performed on rats, giving them 50&nbsp;mg and up every day up to a month. Neurotoxic changes, including vacuolation, have been observed in posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices of rats administered other NMDA antagonists such as PCP, but not with dextromethorphan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olney |first1=J. |last2=Labruyere |first2=J |last3=Price |first3=M. |title=Pathological changes induced in cerebrocortical neurons by phencyclidine and related drugs |journal=Science |volume=244 |issue=4910 |pages=1360–2 |year=1989 |pmid=2660263|doi=10.1126/science.2660263}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carliss |first1=R |last2=Radovsky |first2=A |last3=Chengelis |first3=C|last4=Oneill |first4=T |last5=Shuey |first5=D |title=Oral administration of dextromethorphan does not produce neuronal vacuolation in the rat brain |journal=NeuroToxicology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=813–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17573115 |doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2007.03.009}}</ref> In many documented cases, dextromethorphan has produced [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]] in people who used it recreationally. However, it does not produce [[Substance dependence|physical addiction]], according to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Committee on Drug Dependence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence | title = Seventeenth Report | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 1970 | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_437.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate = 2008-12-29}}</ref>

=== Contraindications ===
Because dextromethorphan can trigger a [[histamine]] release ([[allergic reaction]]), [[atopic]] children, who are especially susceptible to allergic reactions, should be administered dextromethorphan only if absolutely necessary, and only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.<ref name="nhtsa" />

=== Drug interactions ===
Dextromethorphan should not be taken with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs)<ref name="nhtsa" /> due to the potential for [[serotonin syndrome]], which is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur rapidly, due to a buildup of an excessive amount of serotonin in the body.  Dextromethorphan can also cause serotonin syndrome when used with [[SSRI]] medicines, but research has suggested this interaction only occurs when dextromethorphan is taken at [[recreational drug use|recreational doses]], and not at normal therapeutic doses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz|first1=AR|last2=Pizon|first2= AF|year=2008 |title=Dextromethorphan-induced serotonin syndrome |journal=Clinical Toxicology (Philadelphia) |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=771–773 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>

=== Food interactions ===
Caution should be exercised when taking dextromethorphan when drinking [[grapefruit]] juice or eating grapefruits, as [[Grapefruit drug interactions|compounds in grapefruit affect a number of drugs]], including dextromethorphan, through the inhibition of the cytochrome p450 system in the liver and can lead to excessive accumulation and prolonged effects. It is generally recommended that grapefruits and grapefruit juices (namely white grapefruit juice) be avoided while using dextromethorphan and certain other medications.

=== Lab testing ===
Testing for this drug is done either by blood or by urine. Blood can be either serum or plasma, serum in a plain red top 2mL preferred. Urine requires only 2mL minimum.

== Chemistry ==
Dextromethorphan is the [[Dextrorotation|dextrorotatory]] [[enantiomer]] of [[levomethorphan]], which is the methyl [[ether]] of [[levorphanol]], both [[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s. It is named according to [[IUPAC]] rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-[[morphinan]]. As the pure free base, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, white to slightly yellow crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in [[chloroform]] and insoluble in [[water]]. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion exchange resin based on [[Sodium polystyrene sulfonate|polystyrene sulfonic acid]]. Dextromethorphan's [[specific rotation]] in water is +27.6° (20&nbsp;°C, Sodium D-line).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Following oral administration, dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]], where it enters the [[bloodstream]] and crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

At therapeutic doses, dextromethorphan acts [[central nervous system|centrally]] (meaning that it acts on the [[brain]]) as opposed to locally (on the [[respiratory tract]]). It elevates the threshold for coughing, without inhibiting [[cilia]]ry activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and converted into the active metabolite [[dextrorphan]] in the liver by the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. The average dosage necessary for effective antitussive therapy is between 10&nbsp;mg and 45&nbsp;mg, depending on the individual. The International Society for the Study of Cough recommend "an adequate first dose of medication is 60 mg in the adult and repeat dosing should be infrequent rather than the [[List of medical abbreviations: Q|qds]] recommended."<ref>Professor Alyn H Morice paper titled 'Cough' par. 'Dextromethorphan' http://www.issc.info/cough.html</ref>

The duration of action after oral administration is approximately three to eight hours for dextromethorphan-hydrobromide, and ten to twelve hours for dextromethorphan-polistirex. Approximately 1 in 10 of the caucasian population has little or no [[CYP2D6]] enzyme activity leading to long lived high drug levels.<ref>Professor Alyn H Morice paper titled 'Cough' http://www.issc.info/cough.html</ref>

Because administration of dextromethorphan can trigger a [[histamine]] release (an [[allergic]] reaction), its use in [[atopic]] children is very limited.<ref name="nhtsa" />

The first-pass through the [[hepatic portal vein]] results in some of the drug's being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active [[metabolite]] of dextromethorphan called [[dextrorphan]] (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM),<ref name="DXMdualprobe">{{cite journal |last1=Yu |first1=A |last2=Haining |first2=RL |title=Comparative contribution to dextromethorphan metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoforms in vitro: can dextromethorphan be used as a dual probe for both CTP2D6 and CYP3A activities? |journal=Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1514–20 |year=2001 |pmid=11602530}}</ref> and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the [[urine]].<ref name="nhtsa" />

A major metabolic catalyst involved is the [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]] known as 2D6, or [[CYP2D6]]. A significant portion of the population has a functional deficiency in this enzyme and are known as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. O-demethylation of DXM to DXO contributes to 100% of the DXO formed during DXM metabolism.<ref name="DXMdualprobe"/> As CYP2D6 is a major [[metabolic pathway]] in the inactivation of dextromethorphan, the duration of action and effects of dextromethorphan can be increased by as much as three times in such poor metabolizers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capon |first1=Deborah A. |last2=Bochner |first2=Felix |last3=Kerry |first3=Nicole |last4=Mikus |first4=Gerd |last5=Danz |first5=Catherine |last6=Somogyi |first6=Andrew A. |title=The influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism and quinidine on the disposition and antitussive effect of dextromethorphan in humans* |journal=Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics |volume=60 |pages=295–307 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/S0009-9236(96)90056-9}}</ref> In one study on 252 Americans, 84.3% were found to be "fast" (extensive) metabolizers, 6.8% to be "intermediate" metabolizers, and 8.8% were "slow" metabolizers of DXM.<ref name="DXMpolymorphicmetabolism">{{cite journal |last1=Woodworth |first1=JR |last2=Dennis |first2=SR |last3=Moore |first3=L |last4=Rotenberg |first4=KS |title=The polymorphic metabolism of dextromethorphan |journal=Journal of clinical pharmacology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=139–43 |year=1987 |pmid=3680565}}</ref> There are a number of known [[allele]]s for CYP2D6, including several completely inactive variants. The distribution of alleles is uneven amongst ethnic groups; see also [[CYP2D6#Ethnic factors in variability|CYP2D6 - Ethnic factors in variability]].

A large number of medications are potent inhibitors of [[CYP2D6]]. Some types of medications known to inhibit CYP2D6 include certain [[SSRI]] and [[tricyclic]] [[antidepressant]]s, some [[antipsychotics]], and the commonly-available [[antihistamine]] [[diphenhydramine]]. There exists, therefore, the potential of interactions between dextromethorphan and medications that inhibit this enzyme, particularly in slow metabolizers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} See also [[CYP2D6 inhibitors|CYP2D6 - Ligands]].

DXM is also metabolized by [[CYP3A4]]. N-demethylation is primarily accomplished by CYP3A4, contributing to at least 90% of the MEM formed as a primary metabolite of DXM.<ref name="DXMdualprobe" />

A number of other CYP enzymes are implicated as minor pathways of DXM metabolism. [[CYP2B6]] is actually more effective than CYP3A4 at N-demethylation of DXM, but, since the average individual has a much lower CYP2B6 content in his/her liver relative to CYP3A4, most N-demethylation of DXM is catalyzed by CYP3A4.<ref name="DXMdualprobe" />

== History ==
Dextromethorphan was identified as one of three compounds tested as part of [[US Navy]] and [[CIA]]-funded research that sought a "nonaddictive substitute for [[codeine]]"; it is implied that the compound was first found to have clinical potential in this study.<ref>[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/NuclearChemicalBiologicalMatters/02-A-0846RELEASE.pdf ''Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense"'']</ref> It was first patented in 1954.<ref name="DXM patent">[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&NR=684367A&KC=A&FT=D&ND=6&date=19521217&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_gb "The resolution of 3-hydroxy-and 3-methoxy-n-methyl-morphinanes and process for the manufacture of the latter" Patent No- GB684367A and http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT2676177&id=y_1WAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q&f=false "Process for the preparation of optically active 3-methoxy-n-methylmorphinans and salts thereof"] Schnider O and Grüssner A (inventors). US Patent 2 676 177. 20 April 1954. Retrieved 08 February 2011</ref> The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved dextromethorphan as a prescription antitussive drug on September 24, 1954, and subsequently as an [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] cough suppressant in 1958. This filled the need for a cough suppressant lacking the sedative side-effects, stronger potential for misuse, and physically addictive properties of [[codeine]] phosphate, the most widely used cough medication at the time.<ref name="cesar">[http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/dxm.asp Dextromethorphan (DXM) | CESAR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During the 1960s and 1970s, dextromethorphan became available in an over-the-counter tablet form by the brand name Romilar. In 1973, Romilar was taken off the shelves after a burst in sales because of frequent misuse, and was replaced by [[cough syrup]] in an attempt to cut down on abuse<ref name="cesar"/> but the cough syup has increased abuse.  As of January 1, 2012, dextromethorphan is prohibited for sale to minors in the state of California, except with a doctor's prescription.<ref>http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0501-0550/sb_514_bill_20110831_chaptered.pdf</ref>
