A '''boil''', also called a '''furuncle''', is a deep [[folliculitis]], [[infection]] of the [[hair follicle]]. It is most commonly caused by infection by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', resulting in a painful swollen area on the [[human skin|skin]] caused by an accumulation of [[pus]] and dead tissue.<ref name=medline>{{MedlinePlus|001474|Furuncle}}</ref> Individual boils clustered together are called [[carbuncle]]s.<ref name=medline2>{{MedlinePlus|000825|Carbuncle}}</ref>
Most human infections are caused by coagulase-positive ''S. aureus'' [[Strain (biology)|strains]], notable for the bacteria's ability to produce [[coagulase]], an [[enzyme]] that can clot blood. Almost any [[organ system]] can be infected by ''S. aureus''.

==Signs and issues==
Boils are bumpy, red, [[pus]]-filled lumps around a hair follicle that are [[Tenderness (medicine)|tender]], warm, and very painful.  They range from pea-sized to golf ball-sized. A yellow or white point at the center of the lump can be seen when the boil is ready to drain or discharge pus. In a severe infection, an individual may experience [[fever]], swollen [[lymph node]]s, and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. A recurring boil is called chronic furunculosis.<ref name=medline/><ref name=Bolognia>{{cite book |author=Blume JE, Levine EG, Heymann WR |chapter=Bacterial diseases |editor=Bolognia JL, Jorizzo JL, Rapini RP |title=Dermatology |publisher=Mosby |year=2003 |isbn=0-323-02409-2 |page=1126 }}</ref><ref name=habif>{{cite book |author=Habif, TP |chapter=Furuncles and carbuncles |title=Clinical Dermatology: A Color Guide to Diagnosis and Therapy |publisher=Mosby |location=Philadelphia PA |year=2004 |edition=4th }}</ref><ref name=wolf>{{cite book |author=Wolf K, ''et al.'' |chapter=Section 22.

Systemic factors that lower resistance commonly are detectable, including: [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[hematologic disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steele RW, Laner SA, Graves MH |title=Recurrent staphylococcal infection in families |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=189–90 |date=February 1980 |pmid=7356349 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7356349 |doi=10.1001/archderm.116.2.189}}</ref>

==Causes==
Usually, the cause is bacteria such as [[staphylococci]] that are present on the skin. Bacterial colonization begins in the [[hair follicle]]s and can cause local [[cellulitis]] and inflammation.<ref name=medline/><ref name=habif/><ref name=wolf/> Additionally, [[myiasis]] caused by the [[Cordylobia anthropophaga|Tumbu fly]] in Africa usually presents with cutaneous furuncles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tamir J, Haik J, Schwartz E |title=Myiasis with Lund's fly (''Cordylobia rodhaini'') in travelers |journal=J Travel Med |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=293–5 |year=2003 |pmid=14531984}}</ref> [[Risk factor]]s for furunculosis include [[bacteria]]l carriage in the nostrils, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[obesity]], [[Lymphoproliferative disorders|lymphoproliferative]] [[neoplasm]]s, [[malnutrition]], and use of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scheinfeld NS |title=Furunculosis |journal=Consultant |volume=47 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/display/article/10162/36304}}</ref> Patients with recurrent boils are as well more likely to have a positive family history, take antibiotics, and to have been hospitalized, anemic, or diabetic; they are also more likely to have associated skin diseases and multiple lesions.<ref name=ElGilany09>{{cite journal |author=El-Gilany AH, Fathy H |title=Risk factors of recurrent furunculosis |journal=Dermatol Online J |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=16 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19281721 |url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/1501/letters/furunculosis/elgilany.html}}</ref>

==Complications==
The most common [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s of boils are [[scarring]] and [[infection]] or [[abscess]] of the [[skin]], [[spinal cord]], [[brain]], [[kidney]]s, or other organs. Infections may also spread to the bloodstream ([[bacteremia]]) and become life-threatening.<ref name=habif/><ref name=wolf/>  ''S. aureus'' strains first infect the skin and its structures (for example, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[hair follicle]]s) or invade damaged skin (cuts, abrasions). Sometimes the infections are relatively limited (such as a [[stye]], boil, furuncle, or carbuncle), but other times they may spread to other skin areas (causing [[cellulitis]], [[folliculitis]], or [[impetigo]]). Unfortunately, these bacteria can reach the bloodstream ([[bacteremia]]) and end up in many different body sites, causing infections (wound infections, abscesses, [[osteomyelitis]], [[endocarditis]], [[pneumonia]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lina G, Piémont Y, Godail-Gamot F, Bes M, Peter MO, Gauduchon V, Vandenesch F, Etienne J |title=Involvement of Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in primary skin infections and pneumonia |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1128–32 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10524952 |url=http://www.cid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10524952 |doi=10.1086/313461}}</ref> that may severely harm or kill the infected person. ''S. aureus'' strains also produce enzymes and exotoxins that likely cause or increase the severity of certain diseases. Such diseases include [[food poisoning]], [[septic shock]], [[toxic shock syndrome]], and [[scalded skin syndrome]].<ref>http://www.emedicinehealth.com/staphylococcus/page4_em.htm</ref> Almost any organ system can be infected by ''S. aureus''.

==Treatment==
A small boil may burst and drain on its own without any assistance. <ref>Mayo Clinic [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/boils-and-carbuncles/DS00466/DSECTION=symptoms]</ref> In some instances, however, draining can be encouraged by application of a cloth soaked in warm salt water. Washing and covering the furuncle with antibiotic cream or antiseptic [[tea tree oil]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Tree tea oil |work=Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database |url=http://www.naturaldatabase.com/(S(iyok1uyiw1fl112ek3ax2lu2))/nd/Search.aspx?cs=MAYO&s=ND&pt=100&id=113&fs=ND&searchid=11129198}}</ref> and a bandage also promotes healing.

Furuncles at risk of leading to serious complications should be incised and drained by a medical practitioner. These include furuncles that are unusually large, last longer than two weeks, or are located in the middle of the face or near the spine.<ref name=medline/><ref name=wolf/> Fever and chills are signs of sepsis that require immediate treatment.

[[Antibiotic]] therapy is advisable for large or recurrent boils or those that occur in sensitive areas (such as around or in the nostrils or in the ear).<ref name=medline/><ref name=Bolognia/><ref name=habif/><ref name=wolf/>
Staphylococcus aureus has the ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance easily, making treatment difficult. Knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance of ''S. aureus'' is important in the selection of antimicrobials for treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nagaraju U, Bhat G, Kuruvila M, Pai GS, Babu RP |title=Methicillin-resistant ''staphylococcus aureus'' in community-acquired pyoderma |journal=Int J Dermatol |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=412–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15186220 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.02138.x }}</ref> Poor personal hygiene being common, the role of nasal ''S. aureus'' carrier may differ from communities with good hygienic practices. ''Staphylococcus aureus''  re-infection may result from contact with infected family members, contaminated [[fomite]]s, or from other extra-nasal sites. This raises a suggestion to treat household contacts and close contacts if recurrence persists, because it is likely that one or more contacts are asymptomatic carriers of ''S. aureus''. In addition to the increase in the cost of treatment in poor countries, the possibility of developing drug resistance must be considered. The most important independent predictor of recurrence is a positive family history. Boils are spread among individuals by touching or bursting a boil. Furunculosis is a common disease, particularly with deficient hygiene. A large number of ''S. aureus'' organisms are frequently present on the sheets and underclothing of patients with furunculosis and may cause re-infection of patients and infection of other members of the family.<ref name=ElGilany09/>
The role of iron deficiency anemia in recurrent furunculosis was demonstrated, all patients were free from recurrence during the six months follow-up period after iron supplementation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Demircay Z, Eksioglu-Demiralp E, Ergun T, ''et al.'' |title=Phagocytosis and oxidative burst by neutrophils in patients with recurrent furunculosis |journal=Br J Dermatol |volume=138 |issue=6 |pages=1036–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9747369 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.1998.02274.x }}</ref>
A variety of host factors, such as abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis, deficient intra-cellular killing, and immuno-deficient states are of importance in a minority of patients with recurrent furunculosis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fitzpatrick JE |chapter=Bacterial infection |editor=Fitzpatrick JE, Aeling JL |title=Dermatology secrets |publisher=Hanley and Belfus |year=1996 |page=174 }}</ref> Health education about sound personal hygiene and correction of anemia should be mandatory in management of furunculosis.<ref name=ElGilany09/>
It was found that recurrence was significantly associated with poor personal hygiene.<ref>{{cite book |author=Shah KS, Hansotia MF |chapter=Personal hygiene |editor=Iliyas M |title=Community medicine and public health |year=2005 |page=557 }}</ref> A previous study reported that [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] infection was significantly associated with poor personal hygiene.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} It was reported that frequent hand and body washing with water and antimicrobial soap solution {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} decreases staphylococcus skin colonization. Previous use of antibiotics is associated with a high risk of recurrence. This may be due to the development of resistance to the antibiotics used.<ref name=Laube02>{{cite journal |author=Laube S, Farrell M |title=Bacterial skin infection in the elderly: diagnosis and treatment |journal=Drugs and Aging |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=331–42 |year=2002 |pmid=12093320 |doi=10.2165/00002512-200219050-00002 }}</ref> An associated skin disease favors recurrence. This may be attributed to the persistent colonization of abnormal skin with ''S. aureus'' strains, such as is the case in patients with [[atopic dermatitis]].<ref name=Laube02/>
