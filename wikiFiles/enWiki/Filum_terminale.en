The '''filum terminale''' ("terminal thread"), is a delicate strand of fibrous tissue, about 20&nbsp;cm. in length, proceeding downward from the apex of the [[conus medullaris]]. It gives longitudinal support to the [[spinal cord]] and consists of two parts:

* The upper part, or ''filum terminale internum'', is about 15&nbsp;cm. long and reaches as far as the lower border of the second [[sacral vertebra]]. It is continuous above with the [[pia mater]] and contained within a tubular sheath of the [[dura mater]]. In addition, it is surrounded by the nerves forming the [[cauda equina]], from which it can be easily recognized by its bluish-white color.

* The lower part, or ''filum terminale externum'', closely adheres to the dura mater. It extends downward from the apex of the tubular sheath and is attached to the back of the first segment of the [[coccyx]] in a structure sometimes referred to as the ''coccygeal ligament''.

The most [[Anatomical terms of location#inferior|inferior]] of the spinal nerves, the [[coccygeal nerve]] leaves the spinal cord at the level of the conus medullaris, [[Anatomical terms of location#superior|superior]] to the filum terminale. However, adhering to the outer surface of the filum terminale are a few strands of nerve fibers which probably represent rudimentary second and third coccygeal nerves{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. Furthermore, the [[central canal]] of the spinal cord extends 5 to 6&nbsp;cm beyond the conus medullaris, downward into the filum terminale.
