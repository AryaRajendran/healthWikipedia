'''High-output heart failure''' is a term in human and veterinary medicine to describe a condition that occurs when there is a high-output state (a condition where the [[cardiac output]] is higher than normal). There is a circulatory overload which may develop pulmonary edema secondary to an elevated diastolic pressure in left ventricle. These patients have usually a normal systolic function but symptoms are those of a heart failure. With time, this overload causes systolic failure. Ultimately cardiac output can be reduced to very low levels.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hurst's The Heart|edition=10 (International edition)|year=2001|first=Fuster, V.|last=O'Rouke, R.A.|ISBN=0-07-116296-8|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pp.=661|}}</ref>

It may occur in situations with an increased blood volume, from excess of water and salt (renal pathology, excess of fluid or blood administration, treatment with retaining water steroids), chronic and severe [[anemia]], large [[arteriovenous fistula]] or multiple small arteriovenous shunts as in [[Paget's disease of bone]], some forms of severe hepatic or renal disorders, [[hyperthyroidism]], [[beriberi]].<ref>Susan Wolfsthal (ed).
