'''Squamous-cell carcinoma''' (SCC or SqCC) is a [[cancer]] of a kind of [[epithelium|epithelial]] cell, the [[squamous cell]].  These cells are the main part of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of the skin, and this cancer is one of the major forms of [[skin cancer]].  However, squamous cells also occur in the lining of the [[Digestive system|digestive tract]], lungs, and other areas of the body, and SCC occurs as a form of cancer in diverse tissues, including the lips, mouth, esophagus, urinary bladder, prostate, lung, vagina, and cervix, among others.  Despite sharing the name ''squamous cell carcinoma'', the SCCs of different body sites can show tremendous differences in their presenting [[symptom]]s, natural history, [[prognosis]], and response to [[cancer treatment|treatment]].

SCC is a [[histology|histologically]] distinct form of cancer. It arises from the uncontrolled multiplication of cells of epithelium, or cells showing particular cytological or tissue architectural characteristics of squamous cell differentiation, such as the presence of [[keratin]], [[tonofilament]] bundles, or [[desmosome]]s, structures involved in cell-to-cell adhesion.

SCC is still sometimes referred to as "epidermoid carcinoma" and "squamous cell epithelioma", though the use of these terms has decreased.

Cancer can be considered a very large and exceptionally heterogeneous family of malignant diseases, with squamous cell carcinomas comprising one of the largest subsets.<ref name='BermanTaxonomy'>{{cite journal |author=Berman JJ |title=Tumor taxonomy for the developmental lineage classification of neoplasms |journal=BMC Cancer |volume=4 |issue= |pages=88 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15571625 |pmc=535937 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-4-88 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/4/88}}</ref><ref name='BermanAristotle'>{{cite journal |author=Berman JJ |title=Tumor classification: molecular analysis meets Aristotle |journal=BMC Cancer |volume=4 |issue= |page=10 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15113444 |pmc=415552 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-4-10 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/4/10}}</ref><ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O) system lists a number of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] subtypes and variants of [[malignant]] squamous cell [[neoplasm]]s, including:<ref name='ICD-O-2'>World Health Organization. ''International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition''. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 1990.</ref>
*[[Papillary carcinoma]] (Code 8050/3)
*[[Verrucous squamous cell carcinoma]] (Code 8051/3)
*[[Papillary squamous cell carcinoma]] (Code 8052/3)
*Squamous cell carcinoma (Code 8270/3)
*[[Large cell keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma]] (Code 8071/3)
*[[Large cell nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma]] (Code 8072/3)

*[[Intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma]] (Code 8081/3)
*[[Lymphoepithelial carcinoma]] (Code 8082/3)

Other variants of squamous cell carcinoma are recognized under other systems, such as:

* [[Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma]]<ref name="who2004"/>
* [[Clear-cell squamous-cell carcinoma]]<ref name="who2004"/>
* [[Keratoacanthoma]]
* [[Signet-ring-cell squamous-cell carcinoma]]

===Terminology===
All squamous cell carcinoma lesions are thought to begin via the repeated, uncontrolled division of cancer [[stem cells]] of epithelial lineage or characteristics. Accumulation of these cancer cells causes a microscopic focus of abnormal cells that are, at least initially, locally confined within the specific tissue in which the progenitor cell resided. This condition is called squamous cell [[carcinoma in situ|carcinoma ''in situ'']], and it is diagnosed when the tumor has not yet penetrated the [[basement membrane]] or other delimiting structure to invade adjacent tissues. Once the lesion has grown and progressed to the point where it has breached, penetrated, and infiltrated adjacent structures, it is referred to as "[[Invasive (medical)|invasive]]" squamous cell carcinoma. Once a carcinoma becomes invasive, it is able to spread to other organs and cause a [[metastasis]], or "secondary tumor", to form.

===Related conditions===
* [[Basal cell carcinoma]]
* [[Bowen's disease]] is a sunlight-induced skin disease, and is considered to be an early form of squamous cell carcinoma.
* [[Erythroplasia of Queyrat]]
* [[Keratoacanthoma]] is a low-grade malignancy of the skin.  It originates in the [[sebaceous gland|pilo-sebaceous glands]], and is similar in clinical presentation and microscopic analysis to squamous cell carcinoma, except that it contains a central [[keratin]] plug.  Statistically, it is less likely to become invasive than squamous cell carcinoma.
* [[Marjolin's ulcer]] is a type of squamous cell carcinoma that arises from a non-healing [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]] or burn wound.
* [[Melanoma]]

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms are highly variable depending on the involved organs.

SCC of the skin begins as a small nodule and as it enlarges the center becomes necrotic and sloughs and the nodule turns into an ulcer.
*The lesion caused by SCC is often [[symptom#Types|asymptomatic]]
*Ulcer or reddish skin plaque that is slow growing
*Intermittent bleeding from the tumor, especially on the lip
*The clinical appearance is highly variable
*Usually the tumor presents as an ulcerated lesion with hard, raised edges
*The tumor may be in the form of a hard plaque or a [[papule]], often with an opalescent quality, with [[telangiectasia|tiny blood vessels]]
*The tumor can lie below the level of the surrounding skin, and eventually ulcerates and invades the underlying tissue
*The tumor commonly presents on sun-exposed areas (e.g. back of the hand, scalp, lip, and superior surface of [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]])
*On the lip, the tumor forms a small ulcer, which fails to heal and bleeds intermittently
*Evidence of chronic skin photodamage, such as multiple [[actinic keratoses]] (solar keratoses)
*The tumor grows relatively slowly
*Unlike basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has a substantial risk of [[metastasis]]
*Risk of metastasis is higher in SCC arising in scars, on the lower lips or mucosa, and occurring in immunosuppressed patients.

About one-third of lingual and mucosal tumors metastasize before diagnosis (these are often related to tobacco and alcohol use)

==Causes==

=== Human papilloma virus===
[[Human papilloma virus]] (HPV) has been associated with SCC of the [[HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer|oropharynx]], lung,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yu Y, Yang A, Hu S, Yan H |title=Correlation of HPV-16/18 infection of human papillomavirus with lung squamous cell carcinomas in Western China |journal=Oncol.

===By region===

====Skin====
Squamous cell carcinoma is the second-most common [[skin cancer|cancer of the skin]] (after [[basal cell carcinoma]] but more common than [[melanoma]]). It usually occurs in areas exposed to the sun. Sunlight exposure and [[immunosuppression]] are [[risk factors]] for SCC of the skin, with chronic sun exposure being the strongest environmental risk factor.<ref name="mdconsult"/> There is a risk of [[metastasis]] starting more than 10 years{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} after diagnosable appearance of squamous cell carcinoma, but the risk is low{{specify|date=July 2012}}, though much{{specify|date=July 2012}} higher than with basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell cancers of the lip and ears have high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis (20–50%).<ref>http://www.aad.org/public/publications/pamphlets/sun_squamous.html</ref> Squamous cell cancers of the skin in individuals on immunotherapy or suffering from lymphoproliferative disorders (i.e. [[leukemia]]) tend to be much more aggressive, regardless of their location.<ref>http://www.skincarephysicians.com/skincancernet/squamous_cell_carcinoma.html</ref>

SCCs represent about 20% of the non-melanoma skin cancers, but due to their more obvious nature and growth rates, they represent 90% of all head and neck cancers that are initially presented.<ref name=epi>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1965430-overview#a0156 "Head and Neck Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Epidemiology"], Medscape</ref>
The vast majority of SCCs are those of the skin, and like all skin cancers, are the result of [[ultraviolet]] exposure. SCCs usually occur on portions of the body commonly exposed to the [[Sun]]; the [[face]], [[ears]], [[neck]], [[hand]]s, or [[arm]]. The main symptom is a growing bump that may have a rough, scaly surface and flat reddish patches. 
Unlike [[basal cell carcinoma]]s, SCCs carry a significant risk of [[metastasis]], often spreading to the [[lymph node]]s,<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1965430-overview "Head and Neck Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma:Background"], Medscape</ref> and are thus more dangerous.
During its earliest stages, it is sometimes known as [[Bowen's disease]].

[[Saree cancer]] may occur along the [[waist]] in females wearing [[saree]], and caused by constant irritation which can result in scaling or pigmentation. It is a rare type of cancer and generally found in the [[Indian subcontinent]] where saree is a lifetime costume worn by the female.<ref name="TOI sari cancer">{{cite news|last=Mathai|first=Kamini|title=Sari cancer poses threat to women: Doctors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Sari-cancer-poses-threat-to-women-Doctors/articleshow/11678915.cms|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=30 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="JCDR article">{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=S|title=Saree Cancer: The Malignant  Changes in Chronic Irritation|journal=Journal of clinical and diagonostic research|url=http://www.jcdr.org.in/Upload/4333/4333_030612_4333_Rev2.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>

Squamous cell carcinoma are generally treated by surgical [[:wikt:excision|excision]] or [[Mohs surgery]]. Non-surgical options for the treatment of [[cutaneous]] SCC include topical [[chemotherapy]], topical [[immune response]] modifiers, [[photodynamic therapy]] (PDT), [[radiotherapy]], and systemic chemotherapy. The use of topical therapy, such as Imiquimod cream and PDT is generally limited to premalignant (i.e., AKs) and ''in situ'' lesions. Radiation therapy is a primary treatment option for patients in whom surgery is not feasible and is an [[adjuvant]] therapy for those with metastatic or high-risk cutaneous SCC. At this time, systemic chemotherapy is used exclusively for patients with metastatic disease.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

====Head and neck cancer====
[[Image:Oral cancer (1) squamous cell carcinoma histopathology.jpg|thumb|right|[[Biopsy]] of a highly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth. [[H&E stain|Haematoxylin & eosin stain]].]]
Ninety percent <ref>http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Headneck/Aboutheadneckcancers/Typesofheadneckcancer.aspx</ref> of cases of [[head and neck cancer]] (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to squamous cell carcinoma. Symptoms may include a poorly healing [[mouth ulcer]], a hoarse voice or other persistent problems in the area. Treatment is usually with [[surgery]] (which may be extensive) and [[radiotherapy]]. Risk factors include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol consumption]] and [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].<ref name="HSCT">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Zeevi I, ''et al.'' |title=Oral cancer in patients after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: long-term follow-up suggests an increased risk for recurrence |journal=Transplantation |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1243–4 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21119507 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f9caaa}}</ref> In addition, recent studies show that about 25% of mouth and 35% of throat cancers are associated with HPV. The 5 year disease free survival rate for HPV positive cancer is significantly higher when appropriately treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy as compared to non-HPV positive cancer, substantiated by multiple studies including research conducted by Dr. Maureen Gillison, ''et al.'' of Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center.

====Thyroid====

====Oesophagus====
[[Oesophageal cancer]] may be due to either squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or [[adenocarcinoma]] (EAC). SCCs tend to occur closer to the mouth, while adenocarcinomas occur closer to the stomach. [[Dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing, solids worse than liquids) and [[odynophagia]] are common initial symptoms. If the disease is localized, [[esophagectomy]] may offer the possibility of a cure. If the disease has spread, [[chemotherapy]] and radiotherapy are commonly used. [[Zinc deficiency]] is also implicated in the pathogenesis of ESCC in many populations,<ref name=pmid15082451>{{cite journal|author=Kmet J, Mahboubi E.|title= Oesophageal cancer in the Caspian littoral of Iran: initial studies|journal= Science|year= 1972|volume= 175|pages= 846–853|pmid=5008604}}</ref> including persons with chronic alcohol consumption.<ref name=pmid5008604>{{cite journal|author=Poschl G, Seitz HK|title= Alcohol and cancer|journal= Alcohol and alcoholism : international journal of the Medical Council on Alcoholism |year=2004|volume= 39|pages= 155–165|pmid=15082451}}</ref> Abnet et al.<ref name=pmid5008604>{{cite journal|author=Kmet J, Mahboubi E.|title= Esophageal cancer in the Caspian littoral of Iran: initial studies.|journal= Science|year= 1972|volume= 175| pages=846–853|pmid=5008604}}</ref> provided the strongest evidence of an association between dietary zinc deficiency and ESCC in a high-incidence area by establishing an inverse relationship between [[zinc]] concentration in biopsy samples and the subsequent risk of developing ESCC.

====Lung====
{{Main|Squamous cell lung carcinoma}}
[[Image:Ca bronchus.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of a squamous cell carcinoma. Tumour is on the left, obstructing the bronchus (lung). Beyond the tumour, the bronchus is inflamed and contains mucus.]]

When associated with the lung, it is typically a centrally located large cell cancer (non-small cell lung cancer or NSCLC) that often has a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]] causing ectopic production of [[parathyroid hormone-related protein]] (PTHrP), resulting in [[hypercalcemia]]. It is primarily due to smoking.<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=[edited by] Ruth A. Hannon ... [et|title=Porth pathophysiology : concepts of altered health states|year=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-60547-781-7|pages=660|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=2-MFXOEG0lcC&pg=PA660|edition=1st Canadian ed.}}</ref>

====Penis====
When squamous cell carcinoma in situ ([[Bowen's disease]]) is found on the penis, it is called [[erythroplasia of Queyrat]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1100317|Erythroplasia of rat (Bowen Disease of the Glans Penis)}}</ref>  This type of cancer responds very well to [[imiquimod]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

====Prostate====
When associated with the [[prostate]], squamous cell carcinoma is very aggressive in nature. It is difficult to detect as there is no increase in [[prostate specific antigen]] levels seen; meaning that the cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage.

====Vagina and cervix====
Vaginal squamous cell carcinoma spreads slowly and usually stays near the vagina, but may spread to the lungs and liver. This is the most common type of [[vaginal cancer]].

====Bladder====
Most bladder cancer is transitional cell, but bladder cancer associated with [[Schistosomiasis]] is often squamous cell carcinoma.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is via a [[biopsy]].  For the skin, look under [[skin biopsy]].

The pathological appearance of a squamous cell cancer varies with the depth of the biopsy.  For that reason, a biopsy including the subcutaneous tissue and basalar epithelium, to the surface is necessary for correct diagnosis.  The performance of a shave biopsy (see [[skin biopsy]]) might not acquire enough information for a diagnosis.  An inadequate biopsy might be read as [[actinic keratosis]] with follicular involvement.  A deeper biopsy down to the dermis or subcutaneous tissue might reveal the true cancer.  An excision biopsy is ideal, but not practical in most cases.  An incisional or punch biopsy is preferred.  A shave biopsy is least ideal, especially if only the superficial portion is acquired.

==Prevention==
Appropriate clothing, [[sunscreen]] with at least SPF 30, and avoidance of intense sun exposure may prevent [[skin cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=RP|coauthors=Lee, TK, Bajdik, CD, Borugian, M|title=Ultraviolet radiation.|journal=Chronic diseases in Canada|year=2010|volume=29 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=51–68|pmid=21199599}}</ref>

==Management==
Most squamous cell carcinomas are removed with surgery.  A few selected cases are treated with [[topical]] medication.  Surgical excision with a [[free margin]] of healthy tissue is a frequent treatment modality. Radiotherapy, given as [[external beam radiotherapy]] or as [[brachytherapy]] (internal radiotherapy), can also be used to treat squamous cell carcinomas.

[[Mohs surgery]] is frequently utilized; considered the treatment of choice for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, physicians have also utilized the method for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth, throat, and neck.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gross, K.G., ''et al.'' |title=Mohs Surgery, Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |year=1999 }}</ref>  An equivalent method of the [[CCPDMA]] standards can be utilized by a pathologist in the absence of a Mohs-trained physician.  [[Radiation]] therapy often used afterward in high risk cancer or patient types.

[[Electrodesiccation and curettage]] or EDC can be done on selected squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  In areas where SCC's are known to be non-aggressive, and where the patient is not immunosuppressed, EDC can be performed with good to adequate cure rate.

Nodal spread:

1) Surgical block dissection- if palpable nodes or in cases of Marjolin's ulcers but the benefit of prophylactic block lymph node dissection with Marjolin's ulcers is not proven. 

2) Radiotherapy.

(Manoj Ramachandran, Marc A Gladman; Clinical cases and OSCES in Surgery- 2nd ed; churchil livingstone)

[[Imiquimod]] (Aldara) has been used with success for squamous cell carcinoma ''in situ'' of the skin and the penis, but the morbidity and discomfort of the treatment is severe.  An advantage is the cosmetic result: after treatment, the skin resembles normal skin without the usual scarring and morbidity associated with standard excision.  Imiquimod is not FDA-approved for any squamous cell carcinoma.

In 2007, Australian biopharmaceutical company Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals Limited began [[clinical trials]] with an experimental treatment, a [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] called [[afamelanotide]]  (formerly CUV1647)<ref name="Clinuvel-INN">{{Cite web|url=http://www.clinuvel.com/resources/pdf/asx_announcements/2008/20080617WHOGenericName.pdf|title=World Health Organisation assigns CUV1647 generic name|accessdate=2008-06-17|publisher=Clinuvel|year=2008|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref> to provide [[photoprotection]] for organ transplant patients against squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and [[actinic keratosis]].<ref name="Clinuvel">[http://www.clinuvel.com/en/faqs/ Clinuvel » Investors » FAQs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="PharmaAsia">[http://www.pharmaasia.com/article-6618-clinuvelsdrugbeginsglobalphaseiiskincancertrials-Asia.html PharmaAsia - Clinuvel’s Drug Begins Global Phase II Skin Cancer Trials]</ref>

The [[Nigro protocol]] has been recommended as one approach to treatment of lesions less than 5&nbsp;cm.

==Prognosis==
The long-term outcome of Squamous-cell carcinomas is dependent primarily upon several factors: the sub-type of the carcinoma, available treatments, location(s) and severity, and various patient health related variables (accompanying diseases, age, etc.). Generally, the long-term outcome is positive, as less than 4% of Squamous-cell carcinoma cases are at risk of metastasis (and hence life-threatening).<ref>Chollet A, Hohl D, Perrier P. (2012) ''Risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas: the role of clinical and pathological reports'', PMID 22545495</ref><ref>Kay D Brantsch, MD, Christoph Meisner, PhD, Birgitt Schönfisch, PhD, Birgit Trilling, Dipl Inform Med, Jörg Wehner-Caroli, MD, Prof Martin Röcken, MD, Helmut Breuninger, MD.

One study found squamous-cell carcinoma of the penis had a much greater rate of morbidity than some other forms of squamous-cell carcinoma, at a rate of 23%,<ref>Bethune G, Campbell J, Rocker A, Bell D, Rendon R, Merrimen J. (2012) ''Clinical and pathologic factors of prognostic significance in penile squamous cell carcinoma in a North American population.'', PMID 22386252</ref> though relatively high morbidity rate may be associated with possibly latent diagnosis of the disease due to patients avoiding genital exams until the symptoms are debilitating, or a refusal on the part of the patient to submit to a possibly scarring operation upon their genitalia.

Squamous-cell carcinomas of the head and neck have been found to have a greater risk of metastatis to the lymphatic system, and hence possibly reducing treatment efficacy.<ref>Maula, Sanna-Mari. Luukkaa, Marjaana. Grénman, Reidar. Jackson, David. Jalkanen, Sirpa. Ristamäki, Raija. (2003), [http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/63/8/1920.short] ''Intratumoral Lymphatics Are Essential for the Metastatic Spread and Prognosis in Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck Region'',</ref>

Carcinomas of the esophagus was found in one study to have a mean 58% rate of metastasis to local lymph nodes, with the number of lymph nodes compromised decreasing the survival rate.<ref>Hiroko Ide, Tsutomu Nakamura, Kazuhiko Hayashi, Takeshi Endo, Ataru Kobayashi, Reiki Eguchi, Fujio Hanyu. (1994), [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7831x4858452002/abstract/], ''Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: Pathology and prognosis'', DOI 10.1007/BF00316810</ref> On average, the study found that in cases of lymphatic metastatis, the mean 5-year survival rate was 49.5%, with a negative decrease for every lymph node compromised.

Incidence of squamous cell carcinoma varies with age, gender, race, geography, and genetics. The incidence of SCC increases with age and the peak incidence is usually around 66 years old. Males are affected with SCC at a ratio of 2:1 in comparison to females.  Caucasians are more likely to be affected, especially those with fair Celtic skin, if chronically exposed to UV radiation. There are also a few rare congenital diseases predisposed to cutaneous malignancy. In certain geographic locations, exposure to arsenic in well water or from industrial sources may significantly increase the risk of SCC.<ref name="mdconsult">[http://www.mdconsult.com/das/pdxmd/body/107722350-3/761088681?type=med&eid=9-u1.0-_1_mt_1014682 Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma]</ref>
