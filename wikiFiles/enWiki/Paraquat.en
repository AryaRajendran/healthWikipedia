'''Paraquat''' is the trade name for '''''N'',''N''′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride''', one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. Paraquat, a [[viologen]], is quick-acting and non-selective, killing green plant tissue on contact. It is also toxic to human beings and animals. Research has shown that it is linked to development of [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name="park">{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110214115442.htm |title=Two pesticides -- rotenone and paraquat -- linked to Parkinson's disease, study suggests |first= |last= |work=sciencedaily.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref>

==Production==
[[Pyridine]] is coupled with sodium in anhydrous ammonia to give [[4,4'-bipyridine]], which is then [[methylated]] with [[chloromethane]] to give the desired compound:<ref>{{cite web | title = Paraquat and Diquat | publisher = [[IPCS INCHEM]] | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc39.htm}}</ref>

:[[File:Synthesis of paraquat.png|500px]]

==History==
Although first synthesized in 1882, paraquat's herbicidal properties were not recognized until 1955.<ref name="PesticideOnline1">{{cite journal|journal=Pesticides News|title=Paraquat|volume=32|year=1996|pages=20–21|accessdate=13 October 2006}}</ref> Paraquat was first manufactured and sold by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in early 1962, and is today among the most commonly used herbicides.

The [[European Union]] approved the use of paraquat in 2004. Subsequently Sweden, supported by Denmark, Austria, and Finland, brought the European Union commission to court. In 2007, the court annulled the directive authorizing paraquat as an active plant protection substance.<ref name="press release">COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, [http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp07/aff/cp070045en.pdf PRESS RELEASE No° 45/07]</ref>

==Herbicide use==
Paraquat is used as a quaternary ammonium herbicide, one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. It is quick-acting, non-selective, and kills green plant tissue on contact. It is redistributed within the plant, but does not harm mature bark. Herbicides are used to protect crops by controlling a wide range of annual and certain perennial [[weed]]s that would otherwise compete with the crop for water, nutrients, and light.

The key characteristics that distinguish the non-selective contact herbicide paraquat from other active ingredients used in plant protection products are:

*It is non-selective, which means it kills a wide range of annual [[grass]]es and broad-leaved weeds and the tops of established perennial weeds.
*It is very fast-acting.
*It is rain-fast within minutes of application.
*It becomes biologically inactive upon contact with soil.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Revkin, A. C. | year = 1983 | title = Paraquat: A potent weed killer is killing people | journal = Science Digest | volume = 91 | issue = 6 | pages = 36–38}}</ref>
 
These properties, especially broad-spectrum weed control and inactivation upon contact with soil, made paraquat an essential tool in the development of [[no-till farming]].<ref>Hood A. E. M., Jameson H. R. and Cotterell R. (1963).  Destruction of pastures by paraquat as a substitute for ploughing.  Nature, 197, 4869, 381</ref><ref>Hood A. E. M. (1965).  Ploughless farming using "Gramoxone".  Outlook on Agriculture IV, 6, 286–294</ref><ref>Huggins D R & Reganold J. P.  (2008). No-Till:  the Quiet Revolution.  Scientific American, July 2008, pp 70–77</ref>

In the [[United States]], paraquat is available primarily as a solution in various strengths. It is classified as "restricted use," which means that it can be used by licensed applicators only. In the [[European Union]], paraquat has been forbidden since 2007.<ref name="press release"/>

== Reactivity and mode of action ==

Paraquat reacts as an electron acceptor in [[redox]] and [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] reactions.

As an herbicide, paraquat acts by inhibiting photosynthesis. In light-exposed plants, it accepts electrons from [[photosystem I]] (more specifically Fd, which is presented with electrons from PS I) and transfers them to molecular oxygen. In this manner, destructive [[reactive oxygen species]] are produced. In forming these reactive oxygen species, the oxidized form of paraquat is regenerated, and is again available to shunt electrons from photosystem I to start the cycle again.<ref>Summers L.A. (1980) ''The Bipyridinium Herbicides''. Academic Press, New York, NY.</ref>

Paraquat is often used in science to catalyze the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), more specifically, the [[superoxide]] free radical. Paraquat will undergo redox cycling ''in vivo'', being reduced by an electron donor such as  [[NADPH]], before being oxidized by an electron receptor such as [[dioxygen]] to produce [[superoxide]], a major ROS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bus et al. | title = Paraquat: model for oxidant-initiated toxicity | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | year = 1984 | volume = 55 | pages = 37–46}}</ref>

==Weed resistance management==
Problems with herbicide resistant weeds may be addressed by applying herbicides with different modes of action, along with cultural methods such as crop rotation, in integrated weed management (IWM) systems.  Paraquat, with its distinctive mode of action, is one of few chemical options that can be used to prevent and mitigate problems with weeds that have become resistant to the very widely used non-selective herbicide glyphosate.<ref>Beckie H. J. (2011).  Herbicide-resistant weed-management:  focus on glyphosate.  Pest Management Science, 67, 1037–1048</ref><ref>Eubank T. W. et al. (2008).  Glyphosate-resistant horseweed (Conyza canadensis) control using glyphosate-, paraquat-, and glufosinate-based herbicide programs.  Weed Technology, 22, (1), 16–21</ref> 

One example is the "Double Knock" system used in Australia.<ref>Borger C.P. & Hashem A. (2007).  Evaluating the double knockdown technique: sequence, application interval, and annual ryegrass growth stage. Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 58, 265–271</ref> Before planting a crop, weeds are sprayed with glyphosate first, then followed seven to ten days later by a paraquat herbicide.  Although twice as expensive as using a single glyphosate spray, the "Double Knock" system is an important resistance management strategy widely relied upon by farmers.<ref>Walsh M.J. & Powles S.B. (2007).  Management strategies for herbicide resistant weed populations in Australian dryland crop production systems. Weed Technology, 12, 332–338</ref>

A computer simulation conducted by researchers at the Western Australian Herbicide Research Initiative (WAHRI) calculated that if the herbicide used in land preparation was alternated annually between glyphosate and paraquat, only one field in five would be expected to have glyphosate resistant annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) after 30 years, compared to nearly 90% of fields sprayed only with glyphosate.<ref>Neve, P et al. (2003). Simulating evolution of glyphosate resistance. II. Past, present and future use glyphosate use in Australian cropping.  Weed Research, 43, 418-427</ref>  A "Double Knock" regime with paraquat cleaning-up after glyphosate was predicted to keep all fields free of glyphosate resistant ryegrass for at least 30 years.

=="Paraquat pot"==
During the late 1970s, a controversial program sponsored by the US government sprayed paraquat on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] fields in Mexico.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919548-1,00.html Panic over Paraquat], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', May 1, 1978</ref>  Since much of this cannabis was subsequently smoked by Americans, the US government's "Paraquat Pot" program stirred much debate. Perhaps in an attempt to deter people from using cannabis, representatives of the program warned that spraying rendered the crop unsafe to smoke.

However, independent bodies have studied paraquat in this use. A 1995 study found that "no lung or other injury in cannabis users has ever been attributed to paraquat contamination".<ref>Pronczuk de Garbino J, ''Epidemiology of paraquat poisoning'', in: Bismuth C, and Hall AH (eds), <u>Paraquat Poisoning: Mechanisms, Prevention, Treatment</u>, pp. 37-51, New York: Marcel Dekker, 1995.</ref> Also a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] manual states: "... toxic effects caused by this mechanism have been either very rare or nonexistent. Most paraquat that contaminates cannabis is pyrolyzed during smoking to [[dipyridyl]], which is a product of combustion of the leaf material itself (including cannabis) and presents little toxic hazard."<ref>Reigart, J. Routt and Roberts, James R. <u>Recognition and Management of Pesticide Poisonings</u>, 5th edition.  Washington, DC: [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], 1999. [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/safety/healthcare/handbook/handbook.pdf Book available online]</ref>

==Use in suicide and murder ==
A large majority (93%) of fatalities from paraquat poisoning are cases of intentional self-administration, i.e., [[suicide]]s.  In [[third world countries]], paraquat is a major [[suicide agent]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dinham, B.|year=1996|title=Active Ingredient fact sheet, Paraquat|journal=Pesticide News|volume=32|pages=20–21}}</ref> For instance, in [[Samoa]] from 1979–2001, 70% of suicides were by paraquat poisoning. Trinidad and Tobago is particularly well known for its incidence of suicides involving the use of gramoxone. In southern [[Trinidad]], particularly in Penal, Debe from 1996–1997, 76% of suicides were by paraquat, 96% of which involve the over-consumption of alcohol such as rum.<ref>[http://www.pan-germany.org/download/fact_paraquat2.pdf Paraquat and Suicide], Pestizid Aktions-Netzwerk e.V. (PAN Germany).</ref>  Fashion celebrity [[Isabella Blow]] committed suicide using paraquat in 2007.

The reason paraquat is such a widely used suicide agent in third-world countries is due to its widespread availability, low toxic dose (10&nbsp;mL or 2&nbsp;teaspoons is enough to kill) and relative low cost.  There are campaigns to control or even ban paraquat outright, and there are moves to restrict its availability by requiring user education and the locking up of paraquat stores.

The indiscriminate [[paraquat murders]], which occurred in Japan in 1985, were carried out using paraquat as a poison.

Paraquat, as the weedkiller Gramoxone, was used by in the UK in 1981 by Susan Barber to poison the gravy of her husband's Michael's pie. She was convicted of murder in November 1982, maintaining throughout that she had not intended to kill him. <ref>Emsley, John. ''Molecules of Murder: Criminal Molecules and Classic Cases.'' Royal Society of Chemistry Publishing, 2008, p.195</ref>

==Toxicity==
Pure paraquat, when ingested, is highly toxic to mammals, including humans; potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ([[ARDS]]), and there are no specific antidotes. However, [[fuller's earth]] or [[activated charcoal]] is an effective treatment, if taken in time. Death may occur up to 30 days after ingestion. Diluted paraquat used for spraying is less toxic; thus, the greatest risk of accidental poisoning is during mixing and loading paraquat for use.<ref name="PesticideOnline1"/>

<blockquote>
''In acute toxicity studies using laboratory animals, paraquat has been shown to be highly toxic by the inhalation route and has been placed in Toxicity Category I (the highest of four levels) for acute inhalation effects. However, the EPA has determined that particles used in agricultural practices (400 to 800 μm) are well beyond the respirable range and therefore inhalation toxicity is not a toxicological endpoint of concern. Paraquat is toxic (Category II) by the oral route and moderately toxic (Category III) by the dermal route. Paraquat will cause moderate to severe eye irritation and minimal dermal irritation, and has been placed in Toxicity Categories II and IV (slightly toxic) respectively for these effects.''<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0262fact.pdf Paraquat Dichloride], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], accessed 16 August 2007.</ref> 
</blockquote>

Even a single swig, immediately spat out, can cause death from fibrous tissue developing in the lungs, leading to asphyxiation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Buzik, Shirley C.; Schiefer, H. Bruno; Irvine, Donald G. |title=Understanding Toxicology: Chemicals, Their Benefits and Risks |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=1997 |isbn=0-8493-2686-9 |oclc= |doi= |page=31}}</ref>

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control]], ingesting paraquat causes [[symptom]]s such as [[liver]], [[lung]], [[heart]], and [[kidney]] failure within several days to several weeks that can lead to death up to 30 days after ingestion. Those who suffer large exposures are unlikely to survive. Chronic exposure can lead to lung damage, kidney failure, heart failure, and [[oesophageal]] strictures.<ref>[[Centers for Disease Control]], [http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/paraquat/basics/facts.asp Facts about Paraquat], accessed 13 October 2006.</ref> Accidental deaths and suicides from paraquat ingestion are relatively common. For example, there have been 18 deaths in Australia from paraquat poisoning since 2000.<ref>"Poisoned Latrobe," Gary Stevens, ''Valley Express'' Feb. 8, 2008.</ref> Long term exposures to paraquat would most likely cause lung and eye damage, but reproductive/fertility damage was not found by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in their review.
