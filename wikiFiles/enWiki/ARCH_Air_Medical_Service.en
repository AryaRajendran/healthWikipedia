'''ARCH Air Medical Service''' (ARCH was an [[initialism]] for Area Rescue Consortium of Hospitals)is an [[emergency medical service]] (EMS) that provides critical care [[air ambulance]] service in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and the surrounding regions. Air ambulance programs (also known as [[Medevac]]) offer transport by [[helicopter]] (rotor-wing) or [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. ARCH Air was the twelfth program in the U.S. to offer such services when it began operating in March 1979. Transporting approximately 4,200 patients per year by rotorwing, ARCH aircraft are staffed by a [[aviator|pilot]], [[nurse]] and [[paramedic]]. Flights are 80% inter-facility (hospital to hospital) and 20% scene.

Transport is also provided for specialty teams from [[St Marys Health Center]] [[obstetrics]], [[Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital]], [[St. John's Regional Medical Center (Missouri)|St. John's Mercy Medical Center]], [[Creve Coeur]] [[neonatal]], [[St Francis Medical Center]], [[Cape Girardeau]] [[neonatal]], [[Southeast Missouri Hospital]] [[Cape Girardeau]] [[neonatal]], and [[St Johns Hospital]], [[Springfield, IL]] [[neonatal]], University of Missouri Children's Transport Service Peds and Neonate.

==History==
*'''March 1979''': The program began operations as "MARC" (Medical Air Rescue Corps) and was based at [[Saint Louis University Hospital]] flying the [[Sikorsky S-55]].
*'''1980''': MARC replaced the Sikorsky S-55 with the [[Bell JetRanger]] [[Helicopter]].
*'''August 1987''': MARC became a [[not-for-profit]] consortium sponsored by St. Louis' three adult trauma centers (Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. John's Mercy Medical Center and [[Saint Louis University Hospital]]).  The name "ARCH" (Area Rescue Consortium of Hospitals) was selected to identify the cooperative effort. Officially named, "ARCH Air Medical Services".
*'''1989''': Paramedic added to the crew mix of pilot/registered nurse.
*'''1990''': ARCH replaced the Bell JetRanger with the [[MBB/Kawasaki BK 117]] aircraft, offering cabin class, twin-engine, space, speed and safety.<br>1990 also saw the addition of 'fixed-wing' services when it added a [[Beechcraft King Air]] for longer distance transports (100â€“500 miles from base), flights in inclement weather which prohibit rotor wing flights and specialty teams.
*'''1993''': ARCH opens their own Communications Center after having this service done by a sister Ambulance Company owned by the Consortium to meet its own special needs.
*'''1997-2000''': ARCH and Mid-America Transplant, both nonprofits, buy services from for-profit SkyLife. But they get services at a 10 percent to 15 percent discount to the cost they were previously paying to charter air services. Skylife therefore expands their 'fixed-wing service' starting with ARCH's two [[Beechcraft King Air]] and adding two [[Diamond 1A jets]] and one [[Baron 58]]. Based at Spirit of St Louis Airport this service would be available for Organ Procurement Teams and Corporate Charters. SkyLife had contracts to provide critical care transport services with the Regional Organ Bank of Illinois in Chicago, the Iowa Statewide Organ Procurement Organization in Iowa City and Barnes-Jewish Physician Services. As well as previous commitments with Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, St Johns Mercy Medical Center and St Louis Children's Hospital Specialty transport teams.
*'''1999''': ARCH gained national recognition for its accomplishments in quality of service when it received accreditation from the [[Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems]] (CAMTS). Of eight air ambulance programs in Missouri, five have CAMTS accreditation and two are operated by ARCH Air Medical Services, Inc.
*'''2000''': ARCH Air Medical Services, Inc. was acquired by [[Air Methods]] Corporation, which operates air ambulance programs across America. 2000 also saw the acquisition of [[LifeBeat Air Medical]], from [[Southeast Missouri Hospital]]. ARCH is now known as Arch Air Medical Service. Air Methods was not interested in SkyLife Aviation and did not purchase that part of ARCH and therefore Skylife closed their doors December 31, 1999.
*'''2009''': Arch now utilizes [[Eurocopter AS350]]s for many outline bases as well as the BK-117s.

*'''For over 30 years''': Arch Air Medical Service has operated an accident free safety record.

==Current Arch Air Medical Service bases==
The Helicopter Service area is around 150 miles around each base.
*Arch 8 - [[Granite City, Illinois]] N880SL BK 117
*Arch 11 - KidCopter - [[Granite City, Illinois]] N911KD BK 117
*Arch 7 - [[Farmington, Missouri]] N127LN A-Star
*Arch 15 - [[Warrenton, Missouri]] N115LN A-Star
*Arch 12 - [[Sullivan, Missouri]] N217LN BK 117
*Arch 3 - [[Sparta, Illinois]] N330SL BK 117
*Arch 9 - [[Litchfield, Illinois]] N990SL BK 117

*Arch 2 - Spare Aircraft - [[St Louis, Missouri]] N122SL BK 117
*Arch 4 - Spare Aircraft - [[St Louis, Missouri]] N440SL BK 117

Unlike what most programs in the industry practices, Arch's call signs and tailnumbers stay together no matter which base the aircraft responds from. Most Air Medical Programs will keep the call sign to identify which base the given aircraft responded from.
