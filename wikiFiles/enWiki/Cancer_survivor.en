A '''cancer survivor''' is a person with [[cancer]] of any type, current or past, who is still living.  Whether a person becomes a survivor at the time of diagnosis or after completing treatment, whether people who are actively dying are considered survivors, and whether healthy friends and family members of the cancer patient are also considered survivors, varies from group to group.  Some people who have been diagnosed with cancer reject the term ''survivor'' or disagree with some definitions of it.

How many people are cancer survivors depends on the definition used.  About 11 million Americans alive today—one in 30 people–are either currently undergoing treatment for cancer or have done so in the past.<ref name=Sun /> Currently nearly 65% of adults diagnosed with cancer in the developed world are expected to live at least five years after the cancer is discovered.<ref name=Hart />

Many cancer survivors describe the process of living with and beating cancer as a life-changing experience.<ref name=Sulik /><!-- The book generally, but also specifically pages 4, 14, 39, 97, etc. --> It is not uncommon for survivors to use the experience as opportunities for creative self-transformation into a "better person" or as motivation to meet goals of great personal importance, such as climbing a mountain or reconciling with an estranged family member.  Cancer survivors often have specific medical and non-medical needs related to their cancer experience.

==Definitions and alternatives==
[[Macmillan Cancer Support]] in the UK defines a cancer survivor as someone who is "living with or beyond cancer", namely someone who:
* has completed initial cancer management and has no apparent evidence of active disease;
* is living with progressive disease and may be receiving cancer treatment, but is not in the terminal phases of illness; or
* has had cancer in the past.<ref name=Macmillan1 />

The [[National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship]] (NCCS) pioneered the definition of survivor as being any person diagnosed with cancer, from the time of initial diagnosis until his or her death. This expansive definition of "survivor" includes people who are dying from untreatable cancer. NCCS later expanded the definition of survivor even further to include family, friends and [[voluntary caregiver]]s who are affected by the diagnosis in any way.<ref name=DCCPS />  The US [[National Cancer Institute]]'s Office of Cancer Survivorship uses a variant of this expanded definition.<ref name=DCCPS /> 

The word ''survivor'' is a [[Loaded language|loaded term]].<ref name=Sulik /><!-- Pages 318 to 321 -->  Within the [[breast cancer culture]], survivorship is conferred upon women who are perceived as having suffered emotional or physical trauma, even if their [[breast cancer]] was a non-life-threatening pre-cancerous condition like [[LCIS]] or [[Ductal carcinoma in situ|DCIS]].  The term tends to erase and degrade people who are dying of incurable cancer.  This idea of survivorship emphasizes and values longevity of life after diagnosis, while overlooking issues of [[quality of life]].<ref name=Sulik />

Some people reject the term ''survivor'' as being a narrow conceptualization of highly variable human experiences.  Alternatives include '''alivers''' and '''thrivers''', which put emphasis on living as well as possible, despite limitations and disability.<ref name=Sulik /><!-- Page 321 -->  A third term, the '''diers''', is used by some terminally ill patients who reject the claim that dying is part of survivorship or should be covered up with inappropriately optimistic language.<ref name=Sulik /><!-- Page 346 -->

The term '''previvor''' has been used to describe [[Genetic carrier|unaffected carriers]], those who have not diagnosed with [[cancer]], but have a sur'''vived''' the '''pre'''disposition, or higher risk, of cancer due to certain [[genetic mutation]]s.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news |author=Amy Harmon |title=The DNA Age, Cancer Free at Age 33, but Weighing a Mastectomy |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/health/16gene.html |work=The New York Times |date=16 September 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref><ref>http://facingourrisk.org/pre-vivors_and_survivors/cancer_pre-vivors.html </ref> As such, this is the first generation in human history who, armed with information about a predisposition to a cancer after opting in to [[DNA]] testing, can make informed choices prior to cancer diagnosis.  The typical previvor has tested positive for a [[BRCA mutation]] and learned that she is at high risk for developing [[breast cancer]] and [[ovarian cancer]], and is attempting to manage that risk through a combination of increased surveillance through mammograms, breast MRIs, [[pelvic ultrasound]]s, [[oophorectomy]], [[bilateral mastectomy]], and other medical procedures. There has been much controversy over the term ''previvor'', due to the fact that the name compares these healthy women to people have actually been diagnosed with invasive cancer.

==Needs of cancer survivors==
People who have finished cancer treatment often have psychological and physical medical challenges.<ref name=Macmillan2 />  These effects can vary from person to person, change over time, and range in intensity from mild and intermittent to fully [[disabling]].

===Psychosocial===
If the treatment is lengthy and disruptive, many patients experience some difficulty in returning to normal daily life.<ref name=Jennings />  The energy needed to cope with a rigorous treatment program may have caused them to disconnect from previous daily patterns, such as working, normal self-care, and housekeeping.  A small number of patients become dependent on the attention and sympathy that they received during their treatment and feel neglected when life returns to normal.

Some survivors, even if the cancer has been permanently cured, struggle emotionally from the trauma of having experienced a life-threatening disease.<ref name=depression /> Cancer survivors suffer from more psychological distress than those who have never experienced cancer (5.6% compared to 3.0%)<ref name="pmid19636028" />  Serious psychosocial distress was seen 40% more among cancer survivors of 5 years or more than in those who have never had cancer.<ref name="pmid19636028" /> About 10% develop [[major depressive disorder]]; others experience an [[adjustment disorder]].<ref name=depression />  In young adult cancer survivors, one small study found that 20% of participants met the full clinical diagnosis of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and 45% to 95% displayed at least one symptom of PTSD.<ref name="pmid11181770" />  Survivors of adult cancer are at an increased risk of [[suicidal ideology]] (having thoughts about suicide),<ref name="pmid19841325" /> while as many as 13% of childhood cancer survivors experience suicidal ideology.<ref name="pmid16921037" /> Issues of pain and physical ailments have been hypothesized as major contributing factors in cancer survivors experiencing this suicidal ideology.

Other patients have to adjust to the idea that they will never be cured, or that the cancer could return without warning.  Many patients are anxious that any minor [[symptom]] indicates that the cancer has returned, with as many as 9 in 10 patients fearful that their cancer will recur.<ref name=Sun />  In addition to the appearance of any new aches and pains, common triggers for fear include hearing that someone else has been diagnosed with cancer, annual medical exams to determine whether the cancer recurred and news stories about cancer.<ref>{{cite journal

The cultural ideal of a survivor may add to individual patients' distress if the patient is unable or unwilling to live up to the ideal.<ref name=Sulik /><!-- The book generally, but see page 158, 230, 234, 290-291 -->  The ideal survivor is bravely committed to mainstream medicine and optimistic or even certain of a physical cure.  He or she is open about diagnosis and treatment and becomes an educated, empowered [[medical consumerism|medical consumer]].  The ideal survivor, like a [[Superwoman (sociology)|superwoman]] who simultaneously manages her home, family, and career, struggles valiantly to prevent cancer from affecting loved ones by appearing, behaving, and working as much as possible.  Once the immediate crisis is past, the person may feel strongly pressured to donate time, money, and energy to cancer-related organizations.  Above all, the ideal survivor does not die of cancer.  People who publicly conform to this ideal are given social status and respect.<ref name=Sulik />

===Physical===
In terms of medical challenges, some survivors experience [[cancer-related fatigue]], may have long-term side effects from cancer and its treatment, and may need extensive rehabilitation for mobility and function if aggressive surgery was required to remove the cancer.  They may experience temporary or persistent [[chemo brain]].  Some young survivors lose their [[fertility|ability to have children]].

Cancer survivors frequently need medical monitoring, and some treatments for unrelated diseases in the future may be contraindicated.  For example, a patient who has had a significant amount of [[radiation therapy]] may not be a good candidate for more radiation treatments in the future.  To assist with these needs, "survivor care plans" have been promoted.  These are personalized documents that describe the person's diagnosis and treatment in detail, list common known side effects, and specifically outline the steps that the survivor should take in the future, ranging from maintaining a healthy weight to receiving specific medical tests on a stated schedule.<ref name = Plans />

Survivors of childhood cancer have a [[life expectancy]] up to 28% shorter than people in the general population.<ref name="pmid20368646" /> Therefore, there is a need to closely monitor these patients for much longer than usual. The [[Children's Oncology Group]] recommends that monitoring should include periodic follow up and screening by a clinician familiar with these patients' risks. Improving these patients' [[longevity]] requires recognition and treatment of illnesses associated with late effects in the decades after therapy for childhood cancer. For example, survivors of childhood cancer may have more difficulty than typical with [[breastfeeding]] and require more support to undertake this health-promoting activity.<ref>{{cite journal

One challenge to achieving this goal is that childhood cancer survivors are both very adaptable and accustomed to denying difficulties; as a result, they tend to minimize their [[symptoms]]. Therefore, [[internists]] may not give them all the attention they need and thus the actual help they may need.  Symptom management, health promotion, specific attention to psychosocial needs, and surveillance for recurrence and specific late effects of treatment are helpful.<ref name="pmid20368646" />

==Adolescent and young adult survivors==
Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors, often defined as being between the ages of 15-39, have seen advancements in technology and modern medicine causing a dramatic increase in the number of AYA survivors.  Prior to 1970, being diagnosed with cancer during childhood was considered a universally fatal disease.  From 1995 to 2000, however, the 5-year survival rate for children diagnosed with cancer was 80%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ries|first=LA|coauthors=Eisener, MP; Kosary, CL|title=SEER cancer statistics review, 1975-2001|journal=National Cancer Institute|year=2004}}</ref> Significant progress has been built in the last 25 years as there are now approximately 270,000 survivors of pediatric cancer in the U.S., which translates to approximately 1 in every 640 young young adults being a survivor of childhood cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aziz|first=NM|coauthors=Oeffinger, KC; Brooks, S & Turoff, AJ.|title=Comprehensive long-term follow-up programs for pediatric cancer survivors|journal=Wiley InterScience|year=2009|pages=841–848}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=M|title=Childhood cancer survivorship: Improving care and quality of life|year=2003|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|coauthors=Weisner, SL; Simone, JV}}</ref> However, as studies have shown, as patient needs increase, the likelihood of having an unmet need also increases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=RL|coauthors=Schag, CC; Ganz, PA|title=Living with cancer. The cancer inventory of problem situations.|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|year=1984|volume=40|pages=972–980}}</ref> For the AYA population, 2 out of 3 childhood cancer survivors will develop 1 complication due to the therapy they received and 1 out of 3 will develop serious or life-threatening complications, meaning they will most likely need treatment and follow-up care.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Oeffinger|first=KC|coauthors=Hudson|title=MM|journal=CA Cancer Journal for Clinicians|year=2004|volume=54|pages=208–236}}</ref>

An AYA survivor, faces a variety of issues that are unique to their particular age group which differentiate their survivor population from the adult survivor population.  Factors that impact educational attainment, employment, marriage and intimacy, fertility, and other life values differ in the emerging young adult compared with the older adult.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zebrack|first=BJ|coauthors=Zeitzer, LK|title=Quality of life issues and cancer survivorship|journal=Current Problems in Cancer|year=2003|volume=27|pages=198–211}}</ref> Data show that AYA survivors have a much greater risk of getting a second primary malignancy as a side effect of the treatment for their original diagnosis.  It is believed that AYAs have a much higher relative risk of developing a second primary cancer because the intensity of the treatment for their original diagnosis, typically including any combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, is much higher than the level of intensity given to patients over 40.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Soliman|first=H|coauthors=Agresta, SV|title=Current Issues in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship|journal=Cancer Control|year=2008|month=January|volume=15|issue=1|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> Furthermore, since AYA survivors are diagnosed and treated at such a young age, their length of time being a survivor is much longer than their adult counterparts, making it more likely they will face a second primary cancer in their lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Soliman|first=H|coauthors=Agresta, SV|title=Current Issues in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship|journal=Cancer Control|year=2008|month=January|volume=15|issue=1|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>

===Barriers to quality long-term follow-up care===
Childhood cancer survivors, in particular, need comprehensive long-term follow-up care to thrive.  One way this can be accomplished is through continuous follow-up care with a primary care physician that is trained to identify possible late effects from previous treatments and therapies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bhatia|first=S|coauthors=Casillas, J; Hudson, MM; Landier, W|title=Long-term Follow-up Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors|journal=American Academy of Pediatrics|year=2009|month=March|volume=123|issue=3|pages=906–915}}</ref>

The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) has designed a set of survivorship guidelines that hope to aid both health care professionals and survivors themselves, in both the intricacies and basics of long-term follow-up care.  The COG has guidelines for how a patient should put together their own “treatment summary”, so they can have their treatment history with them when they visit any health care provider.  The COG suggests that a survivor include the following in his/her treatment summary:
*Name of disease, date of diagnosis, stage of disease, contact information of the clinics/hospitals where you received your care
*Names and doses of the chemotherapy and radiation you have received and the area of the body that was radiated
*Names and dates of any surgeries you have had
*If you have received a transplant, the type of transplant and where it was received and whether you developed any chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease
*Names and dates of any significant complications and treatment received for those complications<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to Long-term Follow-Up after Treatment for Childhood, Adolescent, or Young Adult Cancer|url=http://www.survivorshipguidelines.org//pdf/introductiontoLong-TermFollow-Up.pdf|publisher=Children's Oncology Group|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=2008}}</ref>

With the treatment summary, experts hope that survivors will be better equipped to face the significant burden of maintaining quality follow-up care long after their original treatment.  This is especially important for the AYA population, in particular, because they are typically facing major social changes regarding their relationship status, employment or education status, their insurance coverage, and even their place of residence, etc.  Typically, most of these factors are pretty constant for the adult population and if they experience any changes, it would occur in one or two aspects of their life.  However, with the AYA population, the period of time until they are 40 is when they are going to, for the majority of the population, undergo the most change.  This reality underscores the importance of a smooth transition from child-centered to adult-focused health care services through which they are consistently managed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Freyer|first=DR|title=Transition of Care for Young Adult Survivors of Childhood and Adolescent Cancer: Rationale and Approaches|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|year=2010|month=November|volume=28|issue=32|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>

===Impact of Affordable Care Act on the AYA survivor population===
The US [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) in 2010 makes it illegal for health insurance providers to deny coverage for a [[pre-existing condition]], such as previously having survived cancer.<ref name=Kaiser>{{cite web|title=Summary of New Health Reform Law|url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf|publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> Young adults will now be required to have insurance coverage and, with a few exceptions, will be able to be covered under their parent's coverage until the age of 26 as a dependent in their parent's plan.<ref name=Kaiser/>
