'''First-degree AV block''', or '''PR prolongation''', is a disease of the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system]] of the [[heart]] in which the [[PR interval]] is lengthened beyond 0.20 seconds.<ref name="urlLesson VI - ECG Conduction Abnormalities">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/kw/ecg/ecg_outline/Lesson6/index.html#First |title=Lesson VI - ECG Conduction Abnormalities |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>

In first-degree AV block, the impulse conducting from atria to ventricles through the AV node is delayed and travels slower than normal. It has a [[prevalence]] in the normal (young adult) population of 0.65-1.1% and the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is 0.13 per 1000 persons.

== Causes ==

The most common causes of first-degree heart block are an AV nodal disease, enhanced vagal tone (for example in athletes), [[myocarditis]], acute [[myocardial infarction]] (especially acute inferior MI), electrolyte disturbances and medication.  The drugs that most commonly cause first-degree heart block are those that increase the refractory time of the [[AV node]], thereby slowing AV conduction. These include [[calcium channel blockers]], [[beta-blockers]], [[cardiac glycosides]], and anything that increases cholinergic activity such as [[cholinesterase inhibitor]]s.  Digitalis is a sodium/potassium ATPase inhibitor and also prolongs AV conduction.

== Diagnosis ==

In normal individuals, the [[AV node]] slows the conduction of electrical impulse through the heart.  This is manifest on a surface [[ECG]] as the PR interval.  The normal PR interval is from 120 [[milliseconds|ms]] to 200 [[milliseconds|ms]] in length.  This is measured from the initial deflection of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex.

In first-degree heart block, the diseased AV node conducts the electrical activity more slowly.  This is seen as a PR interval greater than 200 [[milliseconds|ms]] in length on the surface [[ECG]].  It is usually an incidental finding on a routine [[ECG]].

First-degree heart block does not require any particular investigations except for electrolyte and drug screens, especially if an overdose is suspected.

== Treatment ==

The management includes identifying and correcting electrolyte imbalances and withholding any offending medications.  This condition does not require admission unless there is an associated [[myocardial infarction]].  Even though it usually does not progress to higher forms of heart block, it may require outpatient follow-up and monitoring of the [[ECG]], especially if there is a comorbid [[bundle branch block]].  If there is a need for treatment of an unrelated condition, care should be taken not to introduce any medication that may slow AV conduction.  If this is not feasible, clinicians should be very cautious when introducing any drug that may slow conduction; and regular monitoring of the [[ECG]] is indicated.

== Prognosis ==

Isolated first-degree heart block has no direct clinical consequences. There are no symptoms or signs associated with it. It was originally thought of as having a benign prognosis. In the [[Framingham Heart Study]], however, the presence of a prolonged PR interval or first degree AV block doubled the risk of developing [[atrial fibrillation]] (irregular heart beat), tripled the risk of requiring an [[artificial pacemaker]], and was associated with a small increase in mortality. This risk was proportional to the degree of PR prolongation.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cheng S, Keyes MJ, Larson MG, McCabe EL, Newton-Cheh C, Levy D, Benjamin EJ, Vasan RS, Wang TJ | title=Long-term outcomes in individuals with prolonged PR interval or first-degree atrioventricular block | journal=JAMA | year=2009 | volume=301 | issue=24 | pages=25712577 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.888}}</ref>

A subset of individuals with the triad of first-degree heart block, [[right bundle branch block]], and either [[left anterior fascicular block]] or [[left posterior fascicular block]] (known as [[trifascicular block]]) may be at an increased risk of progression to [[complete heart block]].
