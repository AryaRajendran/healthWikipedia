'''Never events''' are inexcusable actions in a health care setting, the "kind of mistake that should never happen".<ref name=landro2012>{{Citation

Several states have enacted laws requiring the disclosure of never events at hospitals and various remunerative or punitive measures for such events. A recent Leapfrog Group Study<ref>{{cite web

According to a 2012 study published in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', there are as many as 1,500 instances of 'surgical souvenirs'&mdash;instances in which a surgical tool or other foreign object is left inside of a patient's body after surgery&mdash;every year in the United States. The same study suggests an estimated total number of surgical mistakes at just over 4,000 per year in the United States; however, these statistics are extrapolations from incomplete data rather than actual event counts.<ref name=landro2012/>
