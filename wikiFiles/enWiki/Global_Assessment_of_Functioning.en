The '''Global Assessment of Functioning''' ('''GAF''')  is a numeric scale (0 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living.  The scale is presented and described in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] on page 34.  The score is often given as a range.

==Scale==

: '''91 - 100''' No symptoms. Superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities.

: '''81 - 90''' Absent or minimal symptoms (e.g., mild anxiety before an exam), good functioning in all areas, interested and involved in a wide range of activities, socially effective, generally satisfied with life, no more than everyday problems or concerns (e.g., an occasional argument with family members).

: '''71 - 80''' If symptoms are present, they are transient and expectable reactions to psychosocial stressors (e.g., difficulty concentrating after family argument); no more than slight impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., temporarily falling behind in schoolwork).
  
: '''61 - 70''' Some mild symptoms (e.g., depressed mood and mild insomnia) ''or'' some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., occasional truancy, or theft within the household), but generally functioning pretty well, has some meaningful interpersonal relationships.
 
: '''51 - 60''' Moderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) ''or'' moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., few friends, conflicts with peers or co-workers).

: '''41 - 50''' Serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) ''or'' any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).
  
: '''31 - 40''' Some impairment in reality testing or communication (e.g., speech is at times illogical, obscure, or irrelevant) ''or'' major impairment in several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood (e.g., depressed adult avoids friends, neglects family, and is unable to work; child frequently beats up younger children, is defiant at home, and is failing at school).

: '''21 - 30''' Behavior is considerably influenced by delusions or hallucinations ''or'' serious impairment, in communication or judgment (e.g., sometimes incoherent, acts grossly inappropriately, suicidal preoccupation) ''or'' inability to function in almost all areas (e.g., stays in bed all day, no job, home, or friends)
 
: '''11 - 20''' Some danger of hurting self or others (e.g., suicide attempts without clear expectation of death; frequently violent; manic excitement) ''or'' occasionally fails to maintain minimal personal hygiene (e.g., smears feces) ''or'' gross impairment in communication (e.g., largely incoherent or mute).

: '''1 - 10''' Persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) ''or'' persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene ''or'' serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death.

: '''0''' Inadequate information

==Use in litigation==
''Montalvo v. Barnhart'', 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44133 (W.D.N.Y. 2005).(RAMS 2011)

''Montalvo'' attempts to substitute “overall level of functioning and carrying out activities of daily living” with “social, occupational, or school functioning." It is possible to see the possibility of some degree of overlap because "Social functioning" is arguably a subset of overall functioning and [[Activities of daily living]]. However, some have argued that equivalence is not clearly stated in DSM-IV-TR.

GAF levels are commonly used by the [[Veterans Benefits Administration]] of the [[Department of veterans affairs|United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] in determining the appropriate level of disability compensation to be paid to veterans who suffer from service connected psychiatric disorders. The emphasis by the Veterans Administration on using the GAF score has, however, decreased in recent years.<ref>[http://ptsdhelp2000.com/ptsd1.html ptsd1.html<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In disability cases before the Social Security Administration, the agency determines if the GAF is consistent with the narrative report and it is addressed as one technique for capturing the “complexity of clinical situations.”  American Psychiatric Association:  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Washington, DC 1994 (pp.25-35). The agency noted the GAF is just one tool used by clinicians to develop the clinical picture.  It cannot be used in isolation from the rest of the evidence to make a disability decision.  Unlike the Veteran's Administration, the Commissioner of Social Security has specifically declined to endorse the GAF scale for use in the disability programs, and has stated that the GAF scale "does not have a direct correlation to the severity requirements in our mental disorders listings."  Revised Medical Criterial for Evaluating Mental Disorders and Traumatic Brain Injury, 65 Fed. Reg. 50, 746-50, 764-65 (August 21, 2000)
