'''Lycoperdonosis''' is a [[respiratory disease]] caused by the inhalation of large quantities of [[spore]]s from mature [[puffball]]s. It is classified as a [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] (also called extrinsic allergic alveolitis)—an inflammation of the [[alveoli]] within the lung caused by [[hypersensitivity]] to inhaled organic dusts.<ref name=Barrios2008/> It is one of several types of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by different agents that have similar clinical features.<ref name=PerosGolubicic2006/> Typical progression of the disease includes symptoms of a [[common cold|cold]] hours after spore inhalation, followed by [[nausea]], rapid pulse, crepitant [[rales]] (a sound like that made by rubbing hairs between the fingers, heard at the end of inhalation), and [[dyspnea]]. Chest [[radiograph]]s reveal the presence of [[nodule (medicine)|nodules]] in the lungs.<ref name=Alenghat2010/> The early symptoms presented in combination with pulmonary abnormalities apparent on chest radiographs may lead to misdiagnosis of the disease as [[tuberculosis]], [[histiocytosis]], or [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|pneumonia]] caused by ''[[Pneumocystis carinii]]''. Lycoperdonosis is generally treated with [[corticosteroid]]s, which decrease the [[inflammatory response]]; these are sometimes given in conjunction with [[antimicrobial]]s.<ref name=Munson1997/><ref name=MMWR1994/>

The disease was first described in the medical literature in 1967 by R.D.&nbsp;Strand and colleagues in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.<ref name=Strand1967/> In 1976, a 4-year-old was reported developing the disease in Norway after purposely inhaling a large quantity of ''[[Lycoperdon]]'' spores to stop a nosebleed. ''Lycoperdon'' species are sometimes used in [[folk medicine]] in the belief that their spores have [[haemostatic]] properties.<ref name=Henriksen1976/> A 1997 case report discussed several instances of teenagers inhaling the spores. In one severe case, the individual inhaled enough spores so as to be able to blow them out of his mouth. He underwent [[bronchoscopy]] and then had to be on [[life support]] before recovering in about four weeks. In another instance, a teenager spent 18 days in a coma, had portions of his lung removed, and suffered severe [[liver damage]].<ref name=Munson1997/> In [[Wisconsin]], eight teenagers who inhaled spores at a party presented clinical symptoms such as cough, [[fever]], [[shortness of breath]], [[myalgia]], and fatigue within a week. Five of the eight required hospitalization; of these, two required [[intubation]] to assist in breathing.<ref name=MMWR1994/> The disease is rare, possibly because of the large quantity of spores that need to be inhaled for clinical effects to occur.<ref name=Munson1997/> Lycoperdonosis also occurs in dogs; in the few reported cases, the animals had been playing or digging in areas known to contain puffballs.<ref name=Alenghat2010/><ref name=Rubensohn2009/><ref name=Buckeridge2011/> Known species of puffballs implicated in the [[etiology]] of the published cases include the widespread ''[[Lycoperdon perlatum]]'' (the "devil's snuff-box", ''L.&nbsp;gemmatum'') and ''[[Calvatia gigantea]]'', both of the [[Lycoperdaceae]] family.<ref name=Strand1967/><ref name=Rubensohn2009/>
