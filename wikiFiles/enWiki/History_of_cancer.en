'''The History of [[cancer]]''' describes the development of the field of [[oncology]] and its role in the [[history of medicine]].

==Early diagnoses==
[[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''carcinos'' ([[crab]] or [[crayfish]]), among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bordet.be/en/presentation/history/cancer_e/cancer1.htm |title=The History of Cancer.

</ref> Since it was against Greek tradition to open the body, Hippocrates only described and made drawings of outwardly visible tumors on the skin, nose, and breasts. Treatment was based on the [[humorism|humor theory]] of four bodily fluids (black and yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). According to the patient's humor, treatment consisted of diet, blood-letting, and/or laxatives. Through the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body, but humor-theory based treatment remained popular until the 19th century with the discovery of [[cell (biology)|cells]].

[[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca. 25 BC - 50 AD) translated ''carcinos'' into the [[Latin]] ''cancer'', also meaning crab.
<!-- THIS CONTRADICTS THE REFERENCE TO MOSS [[Galen]] (2nd century AD) used "''oncos''" ('swelling') to describe ''all'' tumours, the root for the modern word [[oncology]].<ref name="Galen">{{cite journal |author=Karpozilos A, Pavlidis N |title=The treatment of cancer in Greek antiquity |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=40 |issue=14 |pages=2033–40 |year=2004 |pmid=15341975 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2004.04.036}}</ref> -->
[[Galen]] (2nd century AD) called benign tumours ''oncos'', Greek for swelling, reserving Hippocrates' ''carcinos'' for malignant tumours. He later added the suffix ''-oma'', Greek for swelling, giving the name ''carcinoma''.

The oldest known description and [[surgery|surgical]] treatment of cancer was discovered in [[Egypt]] and dates back to approximately 1600 BC. The [[Papyrus]] describes 8 cases of ulcers of the breast that were treated by cauterization, with a tool called "the fire drill." The writing says about the disease, "There is no treatment."<ref name=CancerOrgHistory>{{cite web

==Modern era==
In the 16th and 17th centuries, it became more acceptable for doctors to [[autopsy|dissect bodies]] to discover the cause of death. The German professor [[Wilhelm Fabry]] believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor [[Francois de la Boe Sylvius]], a follower of [[Descartes]], believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic [[lymph]] fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary [[Nicolaes Tulp]] believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was [[infectious disease|contagious]].<ref name="Marilyn Yalom">

The first cause of cancer was identified by British surgeon [[Percivall Pott]], who discovered in 1775 that cancer of the [[scrotum]] was a common disease among [[chimney sweep]]s. The work of other individual physicians led to various insights, but when physicians started working together they could draw firmer conclusions.

With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' eventually spreads from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites ("[[metastasis]]"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon [[Campbell De Morgan]] between 1871 and 1874.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grange JM, Stanford JL, Stanford CA |title=Campbell De Morgan's 'Observations on cancer', and their relevance today |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=296–9 |year=2002 |url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/95/6/296.pdf|pmid=12042378|doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.296 |pmc=1279913}}</ref> The use of [[surgery]] to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene. The renowned Scottish surgeon [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years. In the 19th century, [[asepsis]] improved surgical hygiene and as the [[cancer survivor|survival]] statistics went up, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer. With the exception of [[William Coley]] who in the late 19th century felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher ''before'' asepsis (and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results), cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor. During the same period, the idea that the body was made up of various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], that in turn were made up of millions of cells, laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body. The age of [[cellular pathology]] was born!

The genetic basis of cancer was recognised in 1902 by the German zoologist [[Theodor Boveri]], professor of [[zoology]] at [[Munich]] and later in [[Würzburg]].<ref>

</ref> He discovered a method to generate cells with multiple copies of the [[centrosome]], a structure he discovered and named. He postulated that [[chromosome]]s were distinct and transmitted different inheritance factors. He suggested that mutations of the chromosomes could generate a cell with unlimited growth potential which could be passed onto its descendants. He proposed the existence of cell cycle check points, [[tumour suppressor gene]]s and [[oncogene]]s. He speculated that cancers might be caused or promoted by radiation, physical or chemical insults or by pathogenic microorganisms.

==Therapies==
When [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] discovered [[radiation]] at the end of the 19th century, they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment. With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment. The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation, but worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients. The complications in communication this brought, along with the necessity of the patient's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home, also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files, which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies.

The [[American Cancer Society]] was originally founded in 1913 by 15 physicians and businessmen in [[New York City]] under the name ''American Society for the Control of Cancer'' (''ASCC''). The current name was adopted in 1945.<ref> name="charitynavigator.org"</ref>

A founding paper of cancer epidemiology was the work of [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health. Her ground-breaking work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill]], who published "[[Lung Cancer]] and Other Causes of Death In Relation to [[Smoking]]. A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors" followed in 1956 (otherwise known as the [[British doctors study]]). Richard Doll left the [[London]] Medical Research Center (MRC), to start the [[Oxford]] unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968. With the use of [[computer]]s, the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data. Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current{{When|date=April 2011}} concepts of disease and [[public health]] policy. Over the past 50&nbsp;years, great efforts have been spent on gathering data across medical practice, hospital, provincial, state, and even country boundaries to study the interdependence of environmental and cultural factors on cancer incidence.

Cancer patient treatment and studies were restricted to individual physicians' practices until [[World War II]], when medical research centers discovered that there were large international differences in disease incidence. This insight drove national public health bodies to enable the compilation of health data across practices and hospitals, a process found in many countries today. The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] was completely destroyed. They concluded that diseased [[bone marrow]] could also be destroyed with radiation, and this led to the development of bone marrow transplants for [[leukemia]]. Since World War II, trends in cancer treatment are to improve on a micro-level the existing treatment methods, standardize them, and globalize them to find cures through [[epidemiology]] and international partnerships.

In 1968 [[Anthony Epstein]], [[Bert Achong]] and Yvonne Barr identified the first [[human cancer virus]], called the [[Epstein-Barr Virus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Epstein MA, Achong BG, Barr YM |title=Virus Particles in Cultured Lymphoblasts from Burkitt's Lymphoma |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7335 |pages=702–3 |year=1964 |month=March |pmid=14107961 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(64)91524-7}}</ref>

==War on Cancer==
{{main|War on Cancer}}
The political 'war' on cancer began with the [[National Cancer Act of 1971]], a [[United States federal law]].<ref>{{cite web

The act was intended "to amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] so as to strengthen the [[National Cancer Institute]] in order to more effectively carry out the national effort against [[cancer]]".
It was signed into law by then [[Richard Nixon|U.S. President Richard Nixon]] on December 23, 1971.<ref>{{cite web

In 1973, cancer research led to a [[cold war]] incident,<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.sunypress.edu/p-133-a-conspiracy-of-cells.aspx | title = A Conspiracy of Cells: One Woman's Immortal Legacy and the Medical Scandal It Caused | last = Gold | first = Michael | isbn = 978-0-88706-099-1}}</ref> where co-operative samples of reported [[oncovirus]]es were discovered to be contaminated by [[HeLa]].

In 1984, [[Harald zur Hausen]] discovered first HPV16 and then HPV18 responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers.  For discovery that human papillomaviruses ([[HPV]]) cause human cancer, zur Hausen won a 2008 Nobel Prize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/hausen-autobio.html |title=Harald zur Hausen - Autobiography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>

Since 1971 the [[United States]] has invested over $200 billion on cancer research; that total includes money invested by public and private sectors and foundations.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sharon Begley | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/157548/page/2 |title=Rethinking the War on Cancer |date=2008-09-16 | work=Newsweek |accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

Despite this substantial investment, the country has seen a five percent decrease in the cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) between 1950 and 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/health/policy/24cancer.html |title=Advances Elusive in the Drive to Cure Cancer |last=Kolata|first=Gina|authorlink=Gina Kolata|date=April 23, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> Longer life expectancy may be a contributing factor to this, as cancer rates and mortality rates increases significantly with age, more than three out of five cancers are diagnosed in people aged 65 and over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/incidence/age/ |title=Cancer incidence by age |publisher=Cancer Research UK |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>
