'''Cancer stem cells''' (CSCs) are [[cancer]] cells (found within [[tumor]]s or [[hematological cancer]]s) that possess characteristics associated with normal [[stem cell]]s, specifically the ability to give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample. CSCs are therefore [[tumorigenic]] (tumor-forming), perhaps in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells. CSCs may generate tumors through the stem cell processes of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Such cells are proposed to persist in tumors as a distinct population and cause [[relapse]] and [[metastasis]] by giving rise to new tumors. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival and quality of life of cancer patients, especially for sufferers of [[metastasis|metastatic disease]].

Existing cancer treatments have mostly been developed based on [[animal model]]s, where therapies able to promote tumor shrinkage were deemed effective. However, animals could not provide a complete model of human disease. In particular, in mice, whose life spans do not exceed two years, tumor relapse is exceptionally difficult to study.

The efficacy of cancer treatments is, in the initial stages of testing, often measured by the ablation fraction of tumor mass ([[fractional kill]]). As CSCs would form a very small proportion of the tumor, this may not necessarily select for drugs that act specifically on the stem cells. The theory suggests that conventional [[chemotherapy|chemotherapies]] kill differentiated or differentiating cells, which form the bulk of the tumor but are unable to generate new cells. A population of CSCs, which gave rise to it, could remain untouched and cause a relapse of the disease.

In different [[tumor]] subtype, cells within the tumor population exhibit functional [[heterogeneity]], [[cell (biology)|cells]] with various proliferative and differentiative capacities.<ref name=2/1>{{cite journal|last=Heppner|first=GH|coauthors=Miller, BE|title=Tumor heterogeneity: biological implications and therapeutic consequences.|journal=Cancer metastasis reviews|year=1983|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5–23|pmid=6616442}}</ref> This functional heterogeneity among [[cancer cells]] lead to create at least two models, which have put forward to account for heterogeneity and differences in [[tumor-regenerative capacity]], the cancer stem cells (CSC) and [[clonal evolution model]]s<ref name=2/7>{{cite journal|last=Reya|first=T|coauthors=Morrison, SJ; Clarke, MF; Weissman, IL|title=Stem cells, cancer, and cancer stem cells.|journal=Nature|date=2001 Nov 1|volume=414|issue=6859|pages=105–11|pmid=11689955}}</ref>

The cancer stem cells model refer to a subset of tumor cells that has the ability to [[self-renew]] and their capable generate the diverse [[tumor cells]].<ref name="2/7" /> These cells have been termed cancer stem cells to reflect their stem-like properties. One implication of the CSC model and existence of CSCs is that the cancer is hierarchically arranged with CSCs lying at the apex of the hierarchy<ref name=2/6>{{cite journal|last=Bonnet|first=D|coauthors=Dick, JE|title=Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell.|journal=Nature medicine|date=1997 Jul|volume=3|issue=7|pages=730–7|pmid=9212098}}</ref> (Fig. 2).[[File:Normal stem cells.png|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' A normal cellular hierarchy comprising stem cells at the apex, which generate common and more restricted progenitor cells and ultimately the mature cell types that constitute particular tissues.]] [[File:Cancer stem cells model.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''.

On the other, the clonal evolution model postulates that mutant tumor cells with a growth advantage are selected and expanded. Cells in the dominant population have a similar potential for initiating or regenerative tumor growth<ref name=2/11>{{cite journal|last=Barabé|first=F|coauthors=Kennedy, JA; Hope, KJ; Dick, JE|title=Modeling the initiation and progression of human acute leukemia in mice.|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|date=2007 Apr 27|volume=316|issue=5824|pages=600–4|pmid=17463288}}</ref> (Fig. 3).[[File:Klonální evoluce.png|thumb|'''Figure 3:''' In the clonal evolution model all undifferentiated cells have similar tumorigenic capacity.]] <ref name=2/8>{{cite journal|last=Nowell|first=PC|title=The clonal evolution of tumor cell populations.|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|date=1976 Oct 1|volume=194|issue=4260|pages=23–8|pmid=959840}}</ref> These two models are not mutually exclusive, as CSCs themselves undergo clonal evolution.

==Evidence==
<br />
The existence of CSCs is a subject of debate within medical research, because many studies have not been successful in discovering the similarities and differences between normal tissue stem cells and cancer stem cells.<ref name="pmid19734877">{{cite journal| author=Gupta PB, Chaffer CL, Weinberg RA| title=Cancer stem cells: mirage or reality? | journal=Nat Med | year= 2009 | volume= 15 | issue= 9 | pages= 1010–2 | pmid=19734877 | doi=10.1038/nm0909-1010 }} <!--Formatted by http://sumsearch.uthscsa.edu/cite/--></ref> Cancer cells must be capable of continuous proliferation and self-renewal in order to retain the many mutations required for [[carcinogenesis]], and to sustain the growth of a tumor since differentiated cells (constrained by the [[Hayflick Limit]]<ref name="pmid14315085">Hayflick, L. The Limited in Vitro Lifetime of Human Diploid Cell Strains. Exp Cell Res 37, 614-636 (1965) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14315085.</ref>) cannot divide indefinitely. However, it is debated whether such cells represent a minority. If most cells of the tumor are endowed with stem cell properties, there is no incentive to focus on a specific sub population. There is also debate on the cell of origin of CSCs - whether they originate from stem cells that have lost the ability to regulate proliferation, or from more differentiated population of progenitor cells that have acquired abilities to self-renew (which is related to the issue of stem cell [[Adult stem cell#Plasticity|plasticity]]).

The first conclusive evidence for CSCs was published in 1997 in Nature Medicine. Bonnet and Dick<ref name="pmid9212098">{{cite journal | author = Bonnet D, [[John Dick (scientist)|Dick JE]] | title = Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 730–7 | year = 1997 | month = July | pmid = 9212098 | doi = 10.1038/nm0797-730| url = | issn = }}</ref> isolated a subpopulation of leukaemic cells that express a specific surface marker [[CD34]], but lacks the [[CD38]] marker. The authors established that the CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>-</sup> subpopulation is capable of initiating tumors in NOD/[[Severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]] mice that is histologically similar to the donor.

In [[cancer research]] experiments, tumor cells are sometimes injected into an [[Animal testing|experimental animal]] to establish a tumor. Disease progression is then followed in time and novel drugs can be tested for their ability to inhibit it. However, efficient tumor formation requires thousands or tens of thousands of cells to be introduced. Classically, this has been explained by poor methodology (i.e. the tumor cells lose their [[:wikt:viable|viability]] during transfer) or the critical importance of the microenvironment, the particular biochemical surroundings of the injected cells. Supporters of the cancer stem cell paradigm argue that only a small fraction of the injected cells, the CSCs, have the potential to generate a tumor. In human [[acute myeloid leukemia]] the frequency of these cells is less than 1 in 10,000.<ref name="pmid9212098"/>

Further evidence comes from [[histology]], the study of the tissue structure of tumors. Many tumors are very [[heterogeneous]] and contain multiple [[cell type]]s native to the host organ. Heterogeneity is commonly retained by tumor metastases. This implies that the cell that produced them had the capacity to generate multiple cell types. In other words, it possessed multidifferentiative potential, a classical hallmark of [[stem cells]].<ref name="pmid9212098"/>

==Origins==
<br />
[[Image:Hierarchical organisation of a tumour according to the CSC model.svg|right|thumb|Hierarchical organisation of a tumour according to the CSC model]]
The origin of cancer stem cells is still an area of ongoing research. Several camps have formed within the scientific community regarding the issue, and it is possible that several answers are correct, depending on the tumor type and the [[phenotype]] the tumor presents. One important distinction that will often be raised is that the [[cell of origin]] for a tumor can not be demonstrated using the cancer stem cell as a model. This is because cancer stem cells are isolated from [[end-stage tumors]]. Therefore, describing a cancer stem cell as a cell of origin is often an inaccurate claim, even though a cancer stem cell is capable of initiating new tumor formation.

With that caveat mentioned, various theories define the origin of cancer stem cells. In brief, they may be: mutants in developing stem or progenitor cells, mutants in [[adult stem cells]] or [[adult progenitor cells]], or mutant cells that acquire stem like attributes. These theories often do focus on a tumor's cell of origin and as such must be approached with skepticism.

Some researchers favor the theory that the cancer stem cell is caused by a mutation in [[stem cell niche]] populations during development. The logical progression claims that these developing stem populations are mutated and then expand such that the mutation is shared by many of the descendants of the mutated stem cell. These daughter stem cells are then much closer to becoming tumors, and since there are many of them there is more chance of a mutation that can cause cancer.<ref name=pmid19477430>{{cite journal | author = Wang Y, Yang J, Zheng H, Tomasek GJ, Zhang P, McKeever PE, Lee EY, Zhu Y| title = Expression of mutant p53 proteins implicates a lineage relationship between neural stem cells and malignant astrocytic glioma in a murine model | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 15 | issue = 6 |  pages = 514–26 | year = 2009 | month = June | pmid = 19477430 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2009.04.001| url = | issn = | pmc = 2721466 }}</ref>

Another theory associates adult stem cells with the formation of tumors. This is most often associated with tissues with a high rate of cell turnover (such as the [[skin]] or [[Gut (zoology)|gut]]). In these tissues, it has long been expected that stem cells are responsible for tumor formation. This is a consequence of the frequent [[cell divisions]] of these stem cells (compared to most adult stem cells) in conjunction with the extremely long lifespan of adult stem cells. This combination creates the ideal set of circumstances for mutations to accumulate; accumulation of mutations is the primary factor that drives [[cancer initiation]]. In spite of the logical backing of the theory, only recently has evidence appeared that this association represents an actual phenomenon. It is important to bear in mind that, due to the heterogeneous nature of evidence it is possible that any individual cancer could come from an alternative origin.

A third possibility often raised is the potential de-differentiation of mutated cells such that these cells acquire stem cell like characteristics. This is often used as a potential alternative to any specific cell of origin, as it suggests that any cell might become a cancer stem cell.

Another related concept is the concept of [[tumor hierarchy]]. This concept claims that a tumor is a heterogeneous population of mutant cells, all of which share some mutations but will vary in specific phenotype. In this model, the tumor is made up of several types of stem cells, one optimal to the specific environment and several less successful lines. These secondary lines can become more successful in some environments, allowing the tumor to adapt to its environment, including the methods by which tumors can be treated. If this situation is accurate, it has severe repercussions on the realism of a cancer stem cell specific treatment regime.<ref name="pmid16990346">{{cite journal | author = Clarke MF, Dick JE, Dirks PB, Eaves CJ, Jamieson CH, Jones DL, Visvader J, Weissman IL, Wahl GM | title = Cancer stem cells--perspectives on current status and future directions: AACR Workshop on cancer stem cells | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 66 | issue = 19 | pages = 9339–44 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16990346 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3126 | url = | issn = }}</ref> Within a tumor hierarchy model, it would be extremely difficult to pinpoint the cancer stem cell's origin.

CSC, now reported in most human tumors, are commonly identified and enriched using for strategies for identifying normal stem cells and are similar across the studies.<ref name=1/7>{{cite journal|last=Golebiewska|first=A|coauthors=Brons, NH; Bjerkvig, R; Niclou, SP|title=Critical appraisal of the side population assay in stem cell and cancer stem cell research.|journal=Cell stem cell|date=2011 Feb 4|volume=8|issue=2|pages=136–47|pmid=21295271}}</ref> The procedures include [[fluorescence-activated cell sorting]] (FACS) with antibodies directed at cell-surface markers and functional approaches including [[SP analysis]] or [[Aldefluor assay]].<ref name=3/9>{{cite journal|last=Scharenberg|first=CW|coauthors=Harkey, MA; Torok-Storb, B|title=The ABCG2 transporter is an efficient Hoechst 33342 efflux pump and is preferentially expressed by immature human hematopoietic progenitors.|journal=Blood|date=2002 Jan 15|volume=99|issue=2|pages=507–12|pmid=11781231}}</ref> The CSC-enriched population purified by these approaches is then implanted, at various cell doses, in [[immune-deficient mice]] to assess their tumor development capacity.

Another approach which also been used for identification of cell subset enrich in CSC in vitro is [[sphere-forming assays]]. Many normal [[stem cells]] such as hematopoietic or stem cells from [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] are capable, under special culture conditioned, form three-dimensional spheres, which can differentiated into multiple cell types.

== Heterogeneity (CSC markers) ==
<br />
Data over recent years have indicated the existence of CSC in various [[solid tumors]]. For isolating CSC from solid and hematological tumors are commonly use markers specific for normal stem cells of the same organ. Nevertheless, a number of cell surface markers have proved useful for isolating of subsets enriched for CSC including [[CD133]] (also now as [[PROM1]]), [[CD44]], [[CD24]], [[EpCAM]] ([[epithelial cell adhesion molecule]], also now as [[epithelial specific antigen]], [[ESA]]), [[THY1]], [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ATP-binding cassette B5]] ([[ABCB5]]) and [[Hoechst 33342|Hoechst<sub>33342]]</sub>.<ref name=2/19>{{cite journal|last=Al-Hajj|first=M|coauthors=Wicha, MS; Benito-Hernandez, A; Morrison, SJ; Clarke, MF|title=Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2003 Apr 1|volume=100|issue=7|pages=3983–8|pmid=12629218}}</ref> 

'''CD133 (prominin 1)''' is a five-[[transmembrane domain]] [[glycoprotein]], expressed on [[CD34]]<sup>+</sup> stem and [[progenitor cells]] in endothelial precursors and [[Neural stem cells|fetal neural stem cells]]. It has been detected by its glycosylated [[epitope]] know as AC133.

'''Hoechst SP''' is site population (SP) phenotype due to the Hoechst<sub>33342</sub> efflux pump on the [[plasma membrane]]. 

'''CD90 (THY1)''' is a [[glycosylphosphatidylinositol]] [[glycoprotein]] anchored in the plasma membrane and involved in [[signal transduction]]. It may also mediate adhesion between [[thymocytes]] and [[thymic stroma]].

== Metastatic cancer stem cells ==
<br />

This potential depends on factors that determine [[Cell growth|growth]], [[angiogenesis]], invasion and other basic processes of tumor cells. In the many epithelial tumors, the [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] (EMT) is considered as a crucial events in the metastatic process.<ref name=2/50>{{cite journal|last=Thiery|first=JP|title=Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in tumour progression.|journal=Nature reviews.

==Implications for cancer treatment==
<br />
The existence of CSCs has several implications in terms of future cancer treatment and therapies. These include disease identification, selective drug targets, prevention of metastasis, and development of new intervention strategies.

Normal somatic stem cells are naturally resistant to chemotherapeutic agents- they have various pumps (such as MDR{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}) that pump out drugs, DNA repair proteins and they also have a slow rate of cell turnover (chemotherapeutic agents naturally target rapidly replicating cells){{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. CSCs that have mutated from normal stem cells may also express proteins that would increase their resistance towards chemotherapeutic agents. These surviving CSCs then repopulate the tumor, causing relapse. By selectively targeting CSCs, it would be possible to treat patients with aggressive, non-resectable tumors, as well as preventing the tumor from metastasizing. The hypothesis suggests that upon CSC elimination, cancer would regress due to differentiation and/or cell death{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. What fraction of tumor cells are CSCs and therefore need to be eliminated is not clear yet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dirks|first=P|title=Cancer stem cells: Invitation to a second round.|journal=Nature|date=2010 Jul 1|volume=466|issue=7302|pages=40-1|doi=10.1038/466040a|pmid=20596007}}</ref> 

A number of studies have investigated the possibility of identifying specific markers that may distinguish CSCs from the bulk of the tumor (as well as from normal stem cells).<ref name="pmid12629218"/> Proteomic and genomic signatures of tumors are also being investigated.<ref name="Insights on neoplastic stem cells from gel-based proteomics of childhood germ cell tumors">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21793190|title=Insights on neoplastic stem cells from gel-based proteomics of childhood germ cell tumors|format=|work=|accessdate=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.  In 2009, scientists identified one compound, [[Salinomycin]], that selectively reduces the proportion of breast CSCs in mice by more than 100-fold relative to [[Paclitaxel]], a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=PB|coauthors=Onder, TT; Jiang, G; Tao, K; Kuperwasser, C; Weinberg, RA; Lander, ES|title=Identification of selective inhibitors of cancer stem cells by high-throughput screening.|journal=Cell|date=2009 Aug 21|volume=138|issue=4|pages=645-59|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.06.034|pmid=19682730}}</ref>

The cell surface receptor interleukin-3 receptor-alpha (CD123) was shown to be overexpressed on CD34+CD38- leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) but not on normal CD34+CD38- bone marrow cells.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11021753</ref> Jin et al., then demonstrated that treating AML-engrafted NOD/SCID mice with a CD123-specific monoclonal antibody impaired LSCs homing to the bone marrow and reduced overal AML cell repopulation including the proportion of LSCs in secondary mouse recipients.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19570512</ref>

==Pathways==
<br />
[[drug design|The design of new drugs]] for the treatment of CSCs will likely require an understanding of the cellular mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation. The first advances in this area were made with [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs) and their transformed counterparts in [[leukemia]], the disease for which the origin of CSCs is best understood. It is now becoming increasingly clear that stem cells of many organs share the same cellular pathways as leukemia-derived HSCs.

Additionally, a normal [[adult stem cell|stem cell]] may be transformed into a cancer stem cell through disregulation of the proliferation and differentiation [[cell signaling|pathways]] controlling it or by inducing [[oncoprotein]] activity.

The [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb group]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] [[repressor]] [[Bmi-1]] was discovered as a common [[oncogene]] activated in [[lymphomas|lymphoma]]<ref name="pmid8414519">{{cite journal | author = Haupt Y, Bath ML, Harris AW, Adams JM | title = bmi-1 transgene induces lymphomas and collaborates with myc in tumorigenesis | journal = Oncogene | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 3161–4 | year = 1993 | month = November | pmid = 8414519 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref> and later shown to specifically regulate HSCs.<ref name="pmid12714971">{{cite journal | author = Park IK, Qian D, Kiel M, Becker MW, Pihalja M, Weissman IL, Morrison SJ, Clarke MF| title = Bmi-1 is required for maintenance of adult self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6937 | pages = 302–5 | year = 2003 | month = May | pmid = 12714971 | doi = 10.1038/nature01587 | url = | issn = }}</ref> The role of Bmi-1 has also been illustrated in neural stem cells.<ref name="pmid14574365">{{cite journal | author = Molofsky AV, Pardal R, Iwashita T, Park IK, Clarke MF, Morrison SJ | title = Bmi-1 dependence distinguishes neural stem cell self-renewal from progenitor proliferation | journal = Nature | volume = 425 | issue = 6961 | pages = 962–7 | year = 2003 | month = October | pmid = 14574365 | doi = 10.1038/nature02060 | url = | issn = | pmc = 2614897 }}</ref> The pathway appears to be active in CSCs of [[pediatric]] [[brain tumor]]s.<ref name="pmid14645703">{{cite journal | author = Hemmati HD, Nakano I, Lazareff JA, Masterman-Smith M, Geschwind DH, Bronner-Fraser M, Kornblum HI | title = Cancerous stem cells can arise from pediatric brain tumors | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 25 | pages = 15178–83 | year = 2003 | month = December | pmid = 14645703 | pmc = 299944 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2036535100 | url = | issn = }}</ref>

===Notch===
The [[Notch pathway]] has been known to developmental biologists for decades. Its role in control of stem cell proliferation has now been demonstrated for several cell types including hematopoietic, neural and mammary<ref name="pmid15535842">{{cite journal | author = Dontu G, Jackson KW, McNicholas E, Kawamura MJ, Abdallah WM, Wicha MS | title = Role of Notch signaling in cell-fate determination of human mammary stem/progenitor cells | journal = Breast cancer research : BCR | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = R605–15 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15535842 | pmc = 1064073 | doi = 10.1186/bcr920 | url = | issn = }}</ref> stem cells. Components of the Notch pathway have been proposed to act as oncogenes in mammary<ref name="pmid10557086">{{cite journal | author = Diévart A, Beaulieu N, Jolicoeur P | title = Involvement of Notch1 in the development of mouse mammary tumors | journal = Oncogene | volume = 18 | issue = 44 | pages = 5973–81 | year = 1999 | month = October | pmid = 10557086 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1202991 | url = | issn = }}</ref> and other tumors.

A particular branch of the Notch signaling pathway that involves the transcription factor [[Hes3 signaling axis|Hes3]] has been shown to regulate the number of cultured cells with cancer stem cell characteristics obtained from glioblastoma patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Park DM, Jung J, Masjkur J, ''et al.'' |title=Hes3 regulates cell number in cultures from glioblastoma multiforme with stem cell characteristics |journal=Sci Rep |volume=3 |issue= |pages=1095 |year=2013 |pmid=23393614 |doi=10.1038/srep01095 |url=}}</ref>

===Sonic hedgehog and Wnt===
These developmental pathways are also strongly implicated as stem cell regulators.<ref name="pmid15549094">{{cite journal | author = Beachy PA, Karhadkar SS, Berman DM | title = Tissue repair and stem cell renewal in carcinogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = 7015 | pages = 324–31 | year = 2004 | month = November | pmid = 15549094 | doi = 10.1038/nature03100 | url = | issn = }}</ref> Both [[Sonic hedgehog]] (SHH) and [[Wnt signalling pathway|Wnt]] pathways are commonly hyperactivated in tumors and are required to sustain tumor growth. However, the Gli transcription factors that are regulated by SHH take their name from [[glioma]]s, where they are commonly expressed at high levels. A degree of [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] exists between the two pathways and their activation commonly goes hand-in-hand.<ref name="pmid15917668">{{cite journal | author = Zhou BP, Hung MC | title = Wnt, hedgehog and snail: sister pathways that control by GSK-3beta and beta-Trcp in the regulation of metastasis | journal = Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.) | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 772–6 | year = 2005 | month = June | pmid = 15917668 | doi = 10.4161/cc.4.6.1744| url = http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cc/abstract.php?id=1744 | issn = }}</ref> This is a trend rather than a rule. For instance, in colon cancer hedgehog signalling appears to antagonise Wnt.<ref name="pmid16299030">{{cite journal | author = Akiyoshi T, Nakamura M, Koga K, Nakashima H, Yao T, Tsuneyoshi M, Tanaka M, Katano M | title = Gli1, downregulated in colorectal cancers, inhibits proliferation of colon cancer cells involving Wnt signalling activation | journal = Gut | volume = 55 | issue = 7 | pages = 991–9 | year = 2006 | month = July | pmid = 16299030 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2005.080333 | url = | issn = | pmc = 1856354 }}</ref>

Sonic hedgehog blockers are available, such as [[cyclopamine]]. There is also a new water soluble cyclopamine that may be more effective in cancer treatment. There is also DMAPT, a water soluble derivative of [[parthenolide]] (induces oxidative stress, inhibits [[NF-κB]] signaling<ref>{{cite journal |title=Targeting signal pathways active in cancer stem cells to overcome drug resistance |journal=Chin J Lung Cancer |author=She M, Chen X |year=2009 |url=http://www.lungca.org/index.php?journal=01&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=10.3779%2Fj.issn.1009-3419.2009.01.001 |pmid=20712949 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=3–7 |doi=10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2009.01.001}}</ref>) for AML (leukemia), and possibly myeloma and prostate cancer. A clinical trial of DMAPT is to start in England in late 2007 or 2008. Finally, the enzyme [[telomerase]] may qualify as a study subject in CSC physiology.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18623070 | doi=10.1002/bies.20793 | volume=30 | issue=8 | title=The many faces of telomerase: emerging extratelomeric effects | year=2008 | month=August | author=Bollmann FM | pages=728–32 | journal = BioEssays}}</ref> GRN163L (Imetelstat) was recently started in trials to target myeloma stem cells. If it is possible to eliminate the cancer stem cell, then a potential cure may be achieved if there are no more CSCs to repopulate a cancer.
