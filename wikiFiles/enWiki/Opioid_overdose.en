An '''opioid overdose''' is an [[acute]] condition due to excessive use of [[narcotics]]. It should not be confused with [[opioid dependency]].

==Symptoms==
[[Toxidromes#Opiate_toxidrome|Opiate overdose symptoms and signs]] include: decreased level of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=Stephanie|title=Symptoms of an opiate overdose|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/68582-symptoms-opiate-overdose/|publisher=Live Strong|accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref>  Heart rate and breathing slow down, sometimes to a stop. Blue lips and nails are caused by insufficient oxygen in the blood. Other symptoms include seizures and muscle spasms. A person experiencing an opiate overdose usually will not wake up even if their name is called or if they are shaken vigorously. Agitation , argumentative, defensive, and some hostial abusive language.<ref>Direct personal experience with percocet abuser.</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Naloxone]] is very effective reversing the cause, rather than just the symptoms, of an opioid overdose.<ref name="pmid17621393">{{cite journal |pmid=17621393 |url=http://www.cjem-online.ca/v2/n3/p156 |year=2000 |last1=Etherington |first1=J |last2=Christenson |first2=J |last3=Innes |first3=G |last4=Grafstein |first4=E |last5=Pennington |first5=S |last6=Spinelli |first6=JJ |last7=Gao |first7=M |last8=Lahiffe |first8=B |last9=Wanger |first9=K |title=Is early discharge safe after naloxone reversal of presumed opioid overdose? |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=156–62 |journal=CJEM}}</ref> A longer-acting variant is [[naltrexone]]. Naltrexone is primarily meant to treat opioid and alcohol dependence. [[Diprenorphine]] (Revivon) is similar in action to naloxone, only it is significantly stronger and is reserved for acting as an antagonist to the strongest, non-human opioids, such as [[carfentanyl]] (in fact, carfentanyl, and other opioids for usage on large animals such as elephants, often come packaged with Revivon to be used after carfentanyl is no longer needed in the animal).

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) estimates that US programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of [[naloxone]] and training on its utilization are estimated to have reversed 10,000 opioid overdose deaths.<ref>{{cite web|title=OD Prevention Program Locator.|url=http://www.overdosepreventionalliance.org/p/od-prevention-program-locator.html|publisher=Overdose Prevention Alliance|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=22337174 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6106a1.htm |year=2012 |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Community-Based Opioid Overdose Prevention Programs Providing Naloxone — United States, 2010 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=101–5 |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report}}</ref> Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the US state of North Carolina, and have been replicated in the US military.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2011.01128.x |title=Project Lazarus: Community-Based Overdose Prevention in Rural North Carolina |year=2011 |last1=Albert |first1=Su |last2=Brason Ii |first2=Fred W. |last3=Sanford |first3=Catherine K. |last4=Dasgupta |first4=Nabarun |last5=Graham |first5=Jim |last6=Lovette |first6=Beth |journal=Pain Medicine |volume=12 |pages=S77–85 |pmid=21668761}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beletsky |first1=Leo |last2=Burris |first2=Scott C. |last3=Kral |first3=Alex H. |title=Closing Death's Door: Action Steps to Facilitate Emergency Opioid Drug Overdose Reversal in the United States |date=July 21, 2009 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1437163 |ssrn=1437163 |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}</ref> Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers’ insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home naloxone to prevent opioid overdose.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11524-006-9120-z |title=Physicians' Knowledge of and Willingness to Prescribe Naloxone to Reverse Accidental Opiate Overdose: Challenges and Opportunities |year=2006 |last1=Beletsky |first1=Leo |last2=Ruthazer |first2=Robin |last3=MacAlino |first3=Grace E. |last4=Rich |first4=Josiah D. |last5=Tan |first5=Litjen |last6=Burris |first6=Scott |journal=Journal of Urban Health |volume=84 |pages=126–36 |pmid=17146712 |issue=1 |pmc=2078257}}</ref> Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the US.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beletsky L, Moroz E.|title=The Quincy Police Department: Pioneering Naloxone Among First Responders |url=http://www.overdosepreventionalliance.org/2012/05/quincy-police-department-pioneering.html|publisher=Overdose Prevention Alliance|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Lavoie D.|title=Naloxone: Drug-Overdose Antidote Is Put In Addicts' Hands|journal=Huffington Post|date=2012 April|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/26/naloxone-drug-overdose-antidote_n_1456531.html}}</ref>

==Co-ingestion==
Opioid overdoses associated with a conjunction of [[benzodiazepines]] or [[alcohol]] use leads to a contraindicated condition wherein higher instances of general negative overdose traits native to the overdose profile of opioid use alone but to a much greater extent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1007 |title=BestBets: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines in opiate overdose and the association with a poorer outcome. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1006 |title=BestBets: Concomitant use of alcohol in opiate overdose and the association with a poorer outcome. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Other CNS depressants, or "downers", muscle relaxers, pain relievers, anti-convulsants, [[anxiolytics]] (anti-anxiety drugs), treatment drugs of a psychoactive or epileptic variety or any other such drug with its active function meant to calm or mitigate neuronal signaling ([[barbiturate]]s, etc.) can additionally cause a worsened condition with less likelihood of recovery cumulative to each added drug of a diverse or disparate hampering effect to the central or peripheral nervous system of the user. This includes drugs less immediately classed to a slowing of the metabolism such as with GABAergics like [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] or glutamatergic antagonists like [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[Ketamine]].
