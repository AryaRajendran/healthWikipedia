'''Neuropathology''' is the study of [[disease]] of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either small surgical biopsies or whole autopsy brains. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of [[anatomic pathology]], [[neurology]], and [[neurosurgery]]. It should not be confused with [[neuropathy|neuro''pathy'']], which refers to disorders of the nerves (usually in the [[peripheral nervous system]]).

== Methodology ==
The work of the neuropathologist consists largely of examining [[biopsy]] tissue from the [[brain]] and spinal cord to aid in [[diagnosis]] of disease. The biopsy is usually requested after a mass is detected by radiologic imaging. As for autopsies, the principal work of the neuropathologist is to help in the post-mortem diagnosis of various forms of dementia and other conditions that affect the central nervous system. 

Biopsies can also consist of the skin. [[Epidermis (skin)|Epidermal]] [[nerve fiber]] density testing (ENFD) is a more recently developed neuropathology test in which a punch skin biopsy is taken to identify small fiber neuropathies by analyzing the nerve fibers of the skin. This pathology test is becoming available in select labs as well as many universities; it replaces the traditional sural nerve biopsy test as less invasive. It is used to identify painful small fiber neuropathies.

== Focus of specialization ==
In many English speaking countries neuropathology is considered a subfield of [[anatomical pathology]]. In contrast, there are a number of independent university chairs in neuropathology and even institutes of neuropathology in German speaking countries due to a different historical background.  A physician who specializes in neuropathology, usually by completing a fellowship after a residency in anatomical or general pathology, is called a neuropathologist. In day-to-day clinical practice, a neuropathologist is a consultant for other physicians.  If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a [[biopsy]] of [[nervous tissue]] is taken and sent to the neuropathologist, who examines it using a microscope or certain molecular methods to make a definitive diagnosis. 

Many neuropathologists in Europe have a background in the clinical neurosciences (neurology, psychiatry) as well as pathology.

'''Neuropathology in the US System'''

Neuropathologists are physicians with either [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] medical school degrees. They must finish either 2 or 3 years of an anatomical pathology residency followed by 2 years of a neuropathology fellowship and be certified by the American Board of Pathology<ref>http://www.abpath.org/</ref> in both anatomical and neuropathology.  It is also quite common for neuropathologists to have a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in a related field.

'''Neuropathology in the UK System'''

Neuropathologists are medically qualified practitioners who are registered with the [[General Medical Council]] in the UK.  A postgraduate qualification in neuropathology is obtained through training and an examination overseen by the [[Royal College of Pathologists]] UK. A neuropathologist has training in anatomic pathology followed by training in relation to diagnosis of diseases of the nervous system and muscle. A specialist examination (called Part2) in neuropathology is run by the [[Royal College of Pathologists]] UK.It is also quite common for neuropathologists to have PhDs in a related field.

In addition to examining central nervous system tissue, the neuropathologist usually is assigned the task of examining muscle and peripheral nerve biopsies. Muscle biopsies are taken to aid in the diagnosis of muscle diseases (such as [[polymyositis]], mitochondrial myopathy, etc.). Peripheral nerve is assessed to help work up patients with suspected peripheral neuropathies secondary to such conditions as [[vasculitis]] and [[amyloidosis]].

Neuropathology is a heavily research oriented field.

== Prominent historical and current figures in neuropathology ==
[[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]] is considered one of the founders of modern neuroanatomy. [[Alois Alzheimer]], the person after whom [[Alzheimer's disease]] is named, is considered an important early contributor to the field.

There are many neuropathologists around the world who have made important clinical and research contributions toward our understanding of diseases that specifically affect the brain (degenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain tumors, trauma and neuromuscular diseases). The majority are members of the International Society of Neuropathology (ISN). For neuropathologists practicing within the United States of America please refer to the Membership Directory available through the American Association of Neuropathologists (AANP) website. There are also Membership Directories available for many of the neuropathology societies that exist in other specific countries and/or regions of the world (British, European, Canadian... etc.).

== Progress ==
A European Board Examination in Neuropathology which emphasizes the importance of proper training in the neurosciences is currently being established (www.euro-cns.org). The most recent international meeting of neuropathologists occurred in September 2006 in San Francisco, California, USA.

== Neuropathology journals ==
Academic neuropathology is served by several specialist neuropathology journals. [[Acta Neuropathologica]] is the neuropathology journal with the highest impact factor.<ref>[http://www.springer.com/medicine/pathology/journal/401 Springer Publishing, accessed December 6th, 2010]</ref> Some journals are sponsored by national or international neuropathology associations: [[Brain Pathology]] is the official journal of the International Society of Neuropathology, [[Neuropathology & Applied Neurobiology]] is sponsored by the [[British Neuropathological Society]], the [[Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology]] is the official journal of the [[American Association of Neuropathologists]] (AANP) and "Neuropathology" is the official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology.
