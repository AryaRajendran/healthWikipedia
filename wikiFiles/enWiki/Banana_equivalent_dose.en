A '''banana equivalent dose''' (abbreviated '''BED''') is a nonstandard unit of [[radiation]] exposure, defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one [[banana]].

The concept is based on the fact that bananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of [[radioactive isotope]]s—even in the absence of any contamination due to human nuclear endeavors.  The banana equivalent dose was meant to express the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapon]]s or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people.

==History==
The concept probably originated on the [http://health.phys.iit.edu/mailman/listinfo/radsafe/ RadSafe] nuclear safety mailing list in 1995, where a value of 9.82×10<sup>−8</sup> sieverts or about 0.1 [[microsievert|μSv]] was suggested.<ref name="radsafelist"/>

==Relationship with standard units==
The BED is supposed to be a [[equivalent dose|radiation dose equivalent]] unit; that is, a unit for measuring potentially damaging radiation absorbed by body tissue, rather than the total radiation (of any kind) emitted by a source or absorbed by matter.  The corresponding [[SI unit]] is the [[sievert]] (Sv), defined as a radiation dose biologically equivalent to one [[joule]] of absorbed gamma-ray energy per [[kilogram]] of tissue. In the U.S, an older unit, the [[roentgen equivalent man]] (rem), equal to 0.01 sieverts, is sometimes used.

The major natural source of radioactivity in plant tissue is [[potassium]], which in nature contains 0.0117% of the unstable [[isotope]] [[potassium-40]] (<sup>40</sup>K). This isotope decays with a [[half-life]] of about 1.25 billion years (4×10<sup>16</sup> seconds), and therefore the [[Radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates|activity]] of natural potassium is about 31 [[becquerel|Bq]]/[[gram|g]] – meaning that, in one gram of the element, about 31 [[atom]]s will decay per [[second]].<ref>The activity of one gram of natural potassium is the number of atoms of <sup>40</sup>K in it, divided by the average lifetime of a <sup>40</sup>K atom in seconds. The number of atoms of <sup>40</sup>K in one gram of natural potasium is 0.000117 times [[Avogadro's number]] 6.022{{e|23}} (the number of atoms per [[mole (unit)|mole]]) divided by the [[atomic weight]] of potassium-40 (39.96 grams per mole), namely about 1.76{{e|18}} per gram.  As in any [[exponential decay]], the average lifetime is the half-life divided by the [[natural logarithm]] of 2, or about 56.82{{e|15}} seconds.</ref><ref name=Samat>Supian Bin Samat et al (1997), [http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/42/2/012/pdf/0031-9155_42_2_012.pdf activity of one gram of potassium],  Phys. Med. Biol. volume 42 page 407, {{doi|10.1088/0031-9155/42/2/012}}</ref> Plants naturally contain other radioactive isotopes, such as [[carbon-14]] (<sup>14</sup>C), but their contribution to the total activity is much smaller.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Since a typical banana contains about half a gram of potassium,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chiquitabananas.com/Worlds-Favorite-Fruit/bananas-and-potassium.aspx |title=Bananas & Potassium |quote=...the average banana contains about 422 [[miligram|mg]] of potassium... |accessdate=2011-07-28}}</ref> it will have an activity of roughly 15 Bq.<ref name="apcal" /> Although the amount in a single banana is small in environmental and medical terms, the radioactivity from a truckload of bananas is capable of causing a [[false alarm]] when passed through a [[Radiation Portal Monitor]] used to detect possible [[smuggling]] of [[nuclear material]] at U.S. ports.<ref>[http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_88.html Issue Brief: Radiological and Nuclear Detection Devices]. Nti.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-19.</ref>

The absorbed radiation dose depends on the type and [[energy]] of the emitted [[subatomic particle|particle]]s, as well as on the location of the source in the body (external, inhaled, ingested, etc.).  According to the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the conversion factor ([[committed effective dose equivalent|CEDE]]) is 5.02 [[nanosievert]]s over 50 years for each becquerel of isotopically pure potassium-40 ingested by an average adult.<ref name="fgr11" /> Using this factor, one banana equivalent dose comes out as about 5.02 nSv/Bq × 31 Bq/g × 0.5 g ≈ 78 nanosieverts = 0.078 μSv.  In informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 μSv.<ref name= "xkcd"/>

==Criticism==
The validity of the banana equivalent dose concept has been challenged.  Critics, including the EPA,<ref name="fgr13">U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (1999), [http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/federal/402-r-99-001.pdf Federal Guidance Report 13], page 16: "For example, the ingestion coefficient risk for 40K would not be appropriate for an application to ingestion  of <sup>40</sup>K in conjunction with an elevated intake of natural potassiumm. This is because the biokinetic model for potassium used in this document represents the relatively slow removal of potassium (biological half-time 30 days) that is estimated to occur for typical intakes of potassium, whereas an elevated intake of potassium would result in excretion of a nearly equal mass of natural potassium, and hence of <sup>40</sup>K, over a short period."</ref> pointed out that the amount of potassium (and therefore of <sup>40</sup>K) in the human body is fairly constant because of [[homeostasis]],<ref name=homeostasis/> so that any excess absorbed from food is quickly compensated by the elimination of an equal amount.<ref name="radsafelist"/><ref name= "meggitt"/>

It follows that the additional radiation exposure due to eating a banana lasts only for a few hours after ingestion, namely the time it takes for the normal potassium contents of the body to be restored by the kidneys.  The EPA conversion factor, on the other hand, is based on the mean time needed for the isotopic mix of potassium isotopes in the body to return to the natural ratio, after being disturbed by the ingestion of pure <sup>40</sup>K; which was assumed by EPA to be 30 days.<ref name="fgr13" />  If the assumed time of residence in the body is reduced by a factor of ten, for example, the estimated equivalent absorbed dose due to the banana will be reduced in the same proportion.

These amounts may be compared to the exposure due to the normal [[composition of the human body|potassium content of the human body]], 2.5 g per [[kilogram|kg]],<ref>Thomas J. Glover, comp., ''Pocket Ref'', 3rd ed. (Littleton: Sequoia, 2003), p. 324 ({{LCCN|2002091021||}}), which in turn cites Geigy Scientific Tables, Ciba-Geigy Limited, Basel, Switzerland, 1984.</ref>  or 175 grams in a 70&nbsp;kg adult.  This potassium will naturally generate 175 g × 31 Bq/g ≈ 5400 Bq of radioactive decays, constantly through the person's adult lifetime.

==Radiation from other foods==
Besides bananas, other foods that are rich in potassium (and therefore in <sup>40</sup>K) are [[potato]]es, [[kidney beans]], [[sunflower seed]]s, and [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s.<ref name="hps.org2" /><ref>[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20100527112912/http://ocrwm.doe.gov/curriculum/unit2/pdf/lesson3activity3.pdf Internal Exposure from Radioactivity in Food and Beverages], U.S. Department of Energy (archived from [http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/curriculum/unit2/pdf/lesson3activity3.pdf the original] on 2007-05-27).</ref> [[Brazil nut]]s, rich in <sup>40</sup>K but also [[radium]] may have up to 444 Bq/kg (12&nbsp;[[nanocurie|nCi]]/kg) – five times the radioactivity of bananas.<ref>[http://www.orau.org/PTP/collection/consumer%20products/brazilnuts.htm Brazil Nuts]. Orau.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-19.</ref><ref>[http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm Natural Radioactivity]. Physics.isu.edu. Retrieved on 2010-10-19.</ref>

By the same reasoning originally used to arrive at the banana equivalent dose, one may conclude that all the food consumed in one year results in a total exposure of about 0.4 mSv (40 mrem),{{or|date=February 2013}} which is more than 10% of the total dose absorbed from all natural and man-made sources in that same period.<ref name=402k>[http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/docs/402-k-07-006.pdf Radiation. Risks and Realities],{{deadlink|date=February 2013}} US Environmental Protection Agency</ref>  However, the same criticisms raised against the BED may apply to this estimate as well.
