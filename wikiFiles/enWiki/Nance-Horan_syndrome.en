Nance-Horan syndrome is a rare X linked syndrome characterized by congenital cataract leading to profound vision loss, characteristic dysmorphic features and dental anomalies.<ref name=Walpole1990>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jmg.27.10.632 |title=The Nance-Horan syndrome |year=1990 |last1=Walpole |first1=I R |last2=Hockey |first2=A |last3=Nicoll |first3=A |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=632–4 |pmid=2246772 |pmc=1017242}}</ref><ref name=Bixler1984>{{cite journal |pmid=6467651 |year=1984 |last1=Bixler |first1=D |last2=Higgins |first2=M |last3=Hartsfield Jr |first3=J |title=The Nance-Horan syndrome: A rare X-linked ocular-dental trait with expression in heterozygous females |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=30–5 |journal=Clinical genetics}}</ref> Microcornea, microphthalmia and mild or moderate mental retardation may accompany these features. Heterozygous females often manifest similarly but with less severe features than affected males.

==Genetics==

This syndrome is due to [[mutation]]s in the Nance Horan gene ([[NHS (gene)|NHS]]) which is located on the short arm of the [[X chromosome]] (Xp22.13).<ref name=Tug2013>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2013.03.094 |title=A Turkish family with Nance-Horan syndrome due to a novel mutation |year=2013 |last1=Tug |first1=Esra |last2=Dilek |first2=Nihal F. |last3=Javadiyan |first3=Shahrbanou |last4=Burdon |first4=Kathryn P. |last5=Percin |first5=Ferda E. |journal=Gene}}</ref>

==Clinical features==

Dental features:
*small teeth in males
*pointed (screwdriver shaped or conical) incisors (sometimes called Hutchinson teeth)
*[[incisor]]s with an irregulal incisal edge
*[[canine tooth|canines]]: enlarged and globular; may be dome or bud shaped with trilobed edge
*[[premolar]]s and [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s: small, round and globular; may have supernumary lobes (mulberry or lotus flower shape)
*widely separated teeth ([[diastemma]])
*hypoplastic [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] 
*dental agenesis
*presence of [[mesiodent]]s (median incisor behind normal upper incisors)
*pulp chamber anomalies


Facial features: 
*anteverted [[pinna]]e
*long face
*prominent nasal bridge and nose
*[[prognathism]] occasionally


Ophthalmic features:
*bilateral congenital nuclear opacities (100%)
*severe [[amblyopia]]
*[[nystagmus]] (93%)
*[[strabismus]] (43%)
*[[microcornea]] (96%)
*congenital [[glaucoma]]
*scleral [[staphyloma]]s
*retinal cystoid degeneration  
*[[microphthalmia]] 
 
These lead to severe visual impairment in affected males.

Other:
*The fourth [[metacarpal]] may be shortened

30% of patients also have some degree of intellectual impairment: of these 80% are mildly to moderately affected: the other 20% may have developmental delays and behavior problems. 

Carrier females display milder variable symptoms of disease. Ocular signs are present in 90% of heterozygous females. These are typically lens opacities often involving the posterior Y sutures. More rarely dental anomalies and the characteristic facial features may also occur.

==Management==

There is no known cure for this syndrome. Patients usually need opthalmic surgery and may also need dental surgery

Genetic counciling and screening of the mother's relatives is recommended.

==History==

This syndrome was first described by Margaret B. Horan and Walter Elmore Nance in 1974.<ref name=Hor1974>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1754.1974.tb01098.x |title=X-Linked Cataract and Hutchinsonian Teeth |year=1974 |last1=Horan |first1=Margaret B. |last2=Billson |first2=F.
