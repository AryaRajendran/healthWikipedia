In [[immunology]], the '''Arthus reaction''' is a type of local [[type III hypersensitivity reaction]].  Type III [[hypersensitivity]] reactions are [[immune complex]]-mediated, and involve the deposition of [[antigen]]/[[antibody]] complexes mainly in the [[blood vessel|vascular]] walls, [[serosa]] ([[pleura]], [[pericardium]], [[synovium]]), and [[glomeruli]].

==History==
The Arthus reaction was discovered by [[Nicolas Maurice Arthus]] in 1903.<ref>Injections répétées de serum du cheval chez le lapin,  ''Comptes rendus des séances de la Société de biologie et de ses filiales'', Paris, '''55''' (1903),  817&ndash;820.</ref>
Arthus repeatedly injected [[horse]]
[[blood plasma|serum]] subcutaneously into [[rabbit]]s.  After four injections,
he found that there was [[edema]] and that the serum was absorbed slowly.  Further injections eventually led to [[gangrene]].

==Process==
The Arthus reaction involves the in situ formation of antigen/antibody complexes after the intradermal injection of an antigen (as seen in passive immunity).  If the animal/patient was previously sensitized (has circulating antibody), an Arthus reaction occurs. Typical of most mechanisms of the [[type III hypersensitivity]], Arthus manifests as local [[vasculitis]] due to deposition of IgG-based immune complexes in dermal blood vessels.  Activation of complement primarily results in cleavage of soluble complement proteins forming C5a and C3a, which activate recruitment of [[Granulocyte|PMNs]] and local mast cell degranulation (requiring the binding of the immune complex onto FcγRIII<ref>{{cite book|last=Parham|first=Peter|title=The Immune System|year=2009|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd|page=390|chapter=12}}</ref>), resulting in an inflammatory response. Further aggregation of immune complex-related processes induce a local [[fibrinoid necrosis]] with ischemia-aggravating thrombosis in the tissue vessel walls.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philidelphia, PA|edition=8th|coauthors=Abbas, A.K., Fausto, N, & Aster, J.C.|editor=William Schmitt|page=205|chapter=6}}</ref> The end result is a localized area of redness and induration that typically lasts a day or so.

Arthus reactions have been infrequently reported after [[vaccination]] against
[[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus]].

<blockquote>
"Arthus reactions (type III hypersensitivity reactions) are
rarely reported after vaccination and can occur after tetanus
toxoid–containing or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines.  An Arthus
reaction is a local vasculitis associated with deposition of
immune complexes and activation of complement. Immune
complexes form in the setting of high local concentration of
vaccine antigens and high circulating antibody concentration.  Arthus reactions are characterized by
severe pain, swelling, induration, edema, hemorrhage, and
occasionally by necrosis. These symptoms and signs usually
occur 4–12 hours after vaccination. ACIP has recommended that
persons who experienced an Arthus reaction after a dose of
tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive Td more
frequently than every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as
part of wound management."
