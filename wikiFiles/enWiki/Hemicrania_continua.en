'''Hemicrania continua''' (HC) is a persistent [[unilateral]] [[headache]] that responds to '''[[indomethacin]]'''. It is usually unremitting, but rare cases of remission have been documented.<ref>Mark Thompson, [http://www.hemicraniacontinua.com/ "Hemicrania Continua"]</ref> Hemicrania continua is considered a primary headache disorder, meaning that it is not caused by another condition.

==Classification==
The [[International Headache Society]]'s International Classification of Headache Disorders classifies hemicrania continua as a primary headache disorder.<ref name=ICHD2>{{cite web |url= http://www.ihs-headache.org/upload/ct_clas/ihc_II_main_no_print.pdf |title=The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2nd Edition (ICHD-2) |format=PDF |work=the Headache Classification Subcommittee of the International Headache Society |accessdate=9/22/2012}}</ref>

== Diagnostic criteria ==
The following diagnostic criteria are given for hemicrania continua<ref name=ICHD2/>:

# Headache for more than 3 months fulfilling other 3 criteria:
# All of the following characteristics:
#* Unilateral pain without side-shift
#* Daily and continuous, without pain-free periods
#* Moderate intensity, but with exacerbations of severe pain
# At least one of the following autonomic features occurs during exacerbations and ipsilateral to the side of pain:
#* [[Conjunctival injection]] and/or [[lacrimation]]
#* Nasal congestion and/or [[rhinorrhea]]
#* [[Ptosis (eyelid)|Ptosis]] and/or [[miosis]]
# Complete response to therapeutic doses of indomethacin

A variant on hemicrania continua has also been described, in which the attacks may shift sides, although meeting the above criteria in all other respects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Newman LC, Lipton RB, Russell M, Solomon S |title=Hemicrania continua: attacks may alternate sides |journal=Headache |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=237–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1628961 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.1992.hed3205237.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Marano E, Giampiero V, Gennaro DR, di Stasio E, Bonusa S, Sorge F |title="Hemicrania continua": a possible case with alternating sides |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=307–8 |year=1994 |pmid=7954766 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-2982.1994.1404305-4.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Newman LC, Spears RC, Lay CL |title=Hemicrania continua: a third case in which attacks alternate sides |journal=Headache |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=821–3 |year=2004 |pmid=15330832 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2004.04153.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid16472344">{{cite journal |author=Matharu MS, Bradbury P, Swash M |title=Hemicrania continua: side alternation and response to topiramate |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=341–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16472344 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2005.01034.x}}</ref>

Main features differentiating CPH from cluster headaches (migrainous neuralgia, above) are the higher frequency and shorter duration of attacks, higher incidence in women, and the response to treatment with indomethacin. CPH is not associated with cranial nerve palsies.

== Epidemiology ==
Hemicrania continua was first described in 1981;<ref name="pmid7305699">{{cite journal |author=Medina JL, Diamond S |title=Cluster headache variant. Spectrum of a new headache syndrome |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=705–9 |year=1981 |pmid=7305699 |doi=}}</ref> at that time around 130 cases were described in the literature.<ref name="pmid7305699"/>  However, rising awareness of the condition has led to increasingly frequent diagnosis in headache clinics, and it seems that it is not as rare as these figures would imply. The condition occurs more often in women than men and tends to present first in adulthood, although it has also been reported in children as young as 5 years old.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peres MF, Silberstein SD, Nahmias S, ''et al.'' |title=Hemicrania continua is not that rare |journal=Neurology |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=948–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11577748 |doi=}}</ref>

== Cause and diagnosis ==
The cause of hemicrania continua is unknown. There is no definitive diagnostic test for hemicrania continua. Diagnostic tests such as imaging studies may be ordered to rule out other causes for the headache. When the symptoms of hemicrania continua are present, it's considered "diagnostic" if they respond completely to [[indomethacin]]. 

The factor that allows hemicrania continua and its exacerbations to be differentiated from [[migraine]] and [[cluster headache]] is that hemicrania continua is completely responsive to indomethacin. [[Triptans]] and other abortive medications do not affect hemicrania continua.

== Symptoms ==
In addition to persistent daily headache of HC, which is usually mild to moderate, HC can present other symptoms.<ref name="isbn1-55009-265-0">{{cite book |author=Goadsby P, Silberstein S, Dodick D |title=Chronic Daily Headache for clinicians |publisher=B C Decker Inc |location= |year=205 |isbn=1-55009-265-0 |oclc= |doi= |page=220}}</ref> These additional symptoms of HC can be divided into three main categories: 

# Autonomic symptoms:
#* conjunctival injection
#* tearing
#* rhinorrhea
#* nasal stuffiness
#* eyelid edema
#* forehead sweating
# Stabbing headaches:
#* Short, "jabbing" headaches superimposed over the persistent daily headache.
#* Usually lasting less than one minute.
# Migrainous features:
#* throbbing pain
#* nausea and/or vomiting
#* [[phonophobia]]
#* [[photophobia]]

== Treatment ==
Hemicrania continua generally responds only to [[indomethacin]] 25–300&nbsp;mg daily, which must be continued long term. Unfortunately, gastrointestinal side effects are a common problem with indomethacin, which may require additional acid-suppression therapy to control.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pareja JA, Caminero AB, Franco E, Casado JL, Pascual J, Sánchez del Río M |title=Dose, efficacy and tolerability of long-term indomethacin treatment of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua |journal=Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=906–10 |year=2001 |pmid=11903285 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-2982.2001.00287.x}}</ref>

In patients who are unable to tolerate indomethacin, the use of [[celecoxib]] 400-800&nbsp;mg per day (Celebrex) and [[rofecoxib]] 50&nbsp;mg per day (Vioxx - no longer available) have both been shown to be effective and are likely to be associated with fewer GI side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peres MF, Silberstein SD |title=Hemicrania continua responds to cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors |journal=Headache |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=530–1 |year=2002 |pmid=12167145 |doi=10.1046/j.1526-4610.2002.02131.x}}</ref> There have also been reports of two patients who were successfully managed with [[topiramate]] 100-200&nbsp;mg per day (Topamax) although side effects with this treatment can also prove problematic.<ref name="pmid16472344"/><ref name="pmid17371364">{{cite journal |author=Brighina F, Palermo A, Cosentino G, Fierro B |title=Prophylaxis of hemicrania continua: two new cases effectively treated with topiramate |journal=Headache |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=441–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17371364 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2007.00733.x}}</ref>
