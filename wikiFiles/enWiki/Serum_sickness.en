'''Serum sickness''' in humans is a [[adverse drug reaction|reaction]] to proteins in [[antiserum]] derived from a non-human [[animal]] source, occurring 4–10 days after exposure.  It is a type of [[hypersensitivity]], specifically [[immune complex hypersensitivity]] (type III). The term '''serum sickness–like reaction (SSLR)''' is occasionally used to refer to similar illnesses that arise from the introduction of certain non-protein substances.<ref name="pmid16504095">{{cite journal |author=Brucculeri M, Charlton M, Serur D |title=Serum sickness-like reaction associated with cefazolin |journal=BMC Clin Pharmacol |volume=6|pages=3 |year=2006 |pmid=16504095 |pmc=1397863 |doi=10.1186/1472-6904-6-3 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6904/6/3}}</ref> It was first characterized by [[Clemens von Pirquet]] and [[Béla Schick]] in 1906.<ref name="pmid11231202">{{cite journal |author=Jackson R |title=Serum sickness |journal=J Cutan Med Surg |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=223–5 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11231202 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Causes==
When an [[antiserum]] is given, the human [[immune system]] can mistake the [[protein]]s present for harmful [[antigen]]s. The body produces antibodies, which combine with these proteins to form [[immune complex]]es. These complexes enter walls of blood vessels and initiate an inflammatory response. They can also cause more reactions resulting in typical symptoms of serum sickness. This results in [[hypocomplementemia]], a low C3 level in serum.

===Antitoxins and Antisera===
Serum sickness can be developed as a result of exposure to [[antibody|antibodies]] derived from animals. These sera or [[antitoxin]]s are generally administered to prevent or treat an infection or [[envenomation]].

===Drugs===
Some of the drugs associated with serum sickness are:
* [[allopurinol]]
* [[barbiturates]]
* [[captopril]]
* [[cephalosporins]]
* [[griseofulvin]]
* [[penicillins]]
* [[phenytoin]]
* [[procainamide]]
* [[quinidine]]
* [[streptokinase]]
* [[sulfonamides]]

===Others===
Allergenic extracts, [[hormones]] and [[vaccines]] can also cause serum sickness.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms can take as long as 14 days after exposure to appear, and may include signs and symptoms commonly associated with [[allergic reaction]]s or infections.
* [[rash]]es
* itching
* joint pain ([[arthralgia]]), especially finger and toe joints
* [[fever]], as high as 104°F and usually appears before rash
* [[lymphadenopathy]] (swelling of lymph nodes), particularly near the site of injection, head and neck
* [[malaise]]
* [[hypotension]] (decreased blood pressure)
* [[splenomegaly]] (enlarged spleen)
* [[glomerulonephritis]]
* [[proteinuria]]
* [[hematuria]]
* [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on history given by patient, including recent medications.

==Treatment==
With discontinuation of offending agent, symptoms usually disappear within 4–5 days.

[[Corticosteroids]], [[Antihistamines]], and [[analgesics]] are main line of treatment. The choice depends of severity of reaction.

Use of [[plasmapheresis]] has also been described.<ref name="pmid17377915">{{cite journal |author=Lundquist AL, Chari RS, Wood JH, ''et al.'' |title=Serum sickness following rabbit antithymocyte-globulin induction in a liver transplant recipient: case report and literature review |journal=Liver Transpl. |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=647–50 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17377915 |doi=10.1002/lt.21098}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Avoidance of antitoxins that may cause serum sickness is best way to prevent seum sickness. Physicians should make their patients aware of the drugs that they are allergic to. [[Skin allergy test|Skin testing]] is done for identifying individuals who may be at risk of reaction.
