He has authored many books and articles about various aspects of wholistic self-healing.

==Personal life==
Benor was born in New York City on July 13, 1941. He developed his interest in [[psychotherapy]] as a teenager. His mother, Ethel Benor, trained as an [[Occupational Therapist]] and established the School for Occupational Therapy and Rehabilitation at [[Hadassah Medical Center]] in Israel. His father, Judah Leon Benor, was Assistant Director of Arab Education in Israel, and consultant to the [[World Bank]] of the [[United Nations]] after his retirement. Benor's younger brother, David Benor, is Associate General Counsel, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].

==Education==
Benor completed a BA in [[Psychology]] at the [[University of California]], Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1961. He trained at the [[David Geffen School of Medicine]] at UCLA, including an extra year of psychiatric research at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. Benor trained in psychiatry at the [[University of Cincinnati]], serving in the US Air Force Medical Service during the Viet Nam War after his first year in psychiatric residency. He later trained for a year each at Colorado Psychiatric Hospital, Denver, Colorado; and [[Denver General Hospital]], followed by a Community Psychiatry Fellowship, also at Denver General Hospital.
Benor has been trained in a many aspects of wholistic healing approaches, including intuition and spiritual awareness, spiritual healing ([[Therapeutic Touch]], [[Reiki]]), [[Eye Movement Desensitization]] and Reprocessing (EMDR), [[Emotional Freedom Techniques]] (EFT) and a family systems therapy  externship at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic, a part of the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] (CHOP). Benor is a founding diplomat of the [[American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine]]<ref>http://www.abihm.org/</ref> ([[ABIHM]])

==Career==

Benor has worked as a psychiatric [[psychotherapist]] in a school psychology service and in a Kibbutz Child and Family Clinic in Israel, and in various mental health centers in the US. He chose to offer wholistic psychiatric psychotherapy rather than respond to the pressure of insurance company compensation-driven processes that led many US psychiatrists to abandon psychotherapy in preference for the prescription of [[psychoactive medication]]s.<ref>Mojtabai, Ramin & Olfson, Mark. National Trends in Psychotherapy by Office-Based Psychiatrists. Archives of General Psychiatry. 2008; 65(8):962-970.</ref>
Benor worked in England from 1988 to 1996, where he had a private wholistic psychotherapy practice. He founded the Doctor-Healer Network-UK<ref>http://www.doctorhealer.org</ref> and began writing a series of books on Healing Research, which are considered classics in this field.<ref>Benor, Daniel J, Healing Research: Volume I, (Popular edition) Spiritual Healing: Scientific Validation of a Healing Revolution, Bellmawr, NJ: Wholistic Healing Publications 2007  (Orig. 2001) ISBN 978-0-9754248-5-8</ref>

<ref>Benor, Daniel J. Healing Research, Volume II: (Professional edition) Consciousness, Bioenergy and Healing. Bellmawr, NJ: Wholistic Healing Publications 2004. ISBN 0-9754248-0-7</ref> 
Benor returned to the US in 1997, and frustrated by US managed care and insurance companies limiting time for psychiatric sessions; he learned two new recognized methods of therapy: [[Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing]] (EMDR) and [[Emotional Freedom Techniques]] (EFT). Each had its merits but did not completely resolve the problem of providing a successful therapy method within these time constraints.
Benor developed a unique method referred to as “[http://wholistichealingresearch.com/wheearticles.html WHEE]” a Wholistic Hybrid derived from EMDR and EFT. A pilot research study <ref>Benor, Daniel J. Ledger, Karen. Toussaint, Loren. Hett, Geoffrey. Zaccaro, Daniel . Pilot Study of Emotional Freedom Techniques, Wholistic Hybrid Derived from Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing and Emotional Freedom Technique, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Treatment of Test Anxiety in University Students, Explore, Nov-Dec 2009, 5(6), 338-340.</ref> confirms that this method is as helpful for exam anxiety as [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], and further research is in progress by Benor, in collaboration with John Thornton, MD,<ref>http://www.spiritualityinhealthcare.net/about.html</ref> on effects of WHEE in treatment of people with chronic pain, depression and anxiety, to include [[SPECT]] brain scans before and after using this method. The concept of WHEE is aimed at enabling people in physical and/or emotional pain to identify how their pain developed; how it is maintained and perpetuated by the unconscious mind and higher self; and how it can be released through wholistic self-healing. 
In 2001 Benor founded, the Council for Healing,<ref>http://councilforhealing.org/WholisticHealing.html</ref> a group of doctors, nurses and other caregivers and teachers involved with healing; their primary mission is to promote understanding of healing and advance access to healing. For 7 years he was the Coordinator for the council. He continues to be an active member in a non-administrative capacity. Benor is Editor-in-Chief of the open access, peer-reviewed International Journal of Healing and Caring,<ref>http://www.wholistichealingresearch.com/ijhchome</ref> which publishes clinical, theoretical and research papers related to wholistic healing submitted by his professional peers.
Benor is a Professor at Energy Medicine University in California,<ref>http://energymedicineuniversity.org/faculty/benor.html</ref> where he teaches distant learning Phenomenology Research in Wholisitic [[Spiritual Healing]] courses and WHEE. He also teaches a course on Transformative Wholistic Reintegration in conjunction with the Integrative Energy Healing department at [[Langara College]] in Vancouver, BC. In 2006 Benor moved to [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada (near Toronto), where he teaches wholistic healing. He is also active in the Transition Guelph group,<ref>http://transitionguelph.org/</ref> one of many Transition Town groups around the world, working to develop planetary healing awareness through local initiatives.

==Guiding philosophy==

Benor believes that each conscious being in the universe is part of a [[cosmic consciousness]]. He teaches that by understanding and integrating body, emotions, mind, our relationships with the environment and others and lastly, our spirit, we can achieve optimal health through harmonization of our being. Benor believes that the best healthcare is wholistic [[integrative medicine]], which involves assessments and treatments through complementary/[[alternative therapies]] combined with assessments and treatments with conventional medical care.
