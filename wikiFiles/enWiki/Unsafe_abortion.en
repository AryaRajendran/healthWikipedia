==Overview==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that each year nearly 42 million women faced with [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]] have abortions, of which 20 million are unsafe, mostly in countries where abortion is illegal.<ref name="Rosenthal2007" /><ref name="Httpwwwwhointreproductivehealthtopicsunsafe_abortionenindexhtml">"[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/en/index.html Preventing unsafe abortion]" (World Health Organization 2011): "Each year nearly 42 million women faced with an unplanned pregnancy have an abortion, and about 20 million of them resort to unsafe abortion - often self-induced or obtained clandestinely."</ref> According to WHO and Guttmacher, approximately 68,000 women die annually as a result of complications of unsafe abortion; and between two million and seven million women each year survive unsafe abortion but sustain long-term damage or disease (incomplete abortion, infection (sepsis), haemorrhage, and injury to the internal organs, such as puncturing or tearing of the uterus). They also concluded abortion is safe in countries where it's legal, but dangerous in countries where it's outlawed and performed clandestinely. The WHO reports that in developed regions, nearly all abortions (92%) are safe, whereas in developing countries, more than half (55%) are unsafe.<ref name="Httpwwwwhointreproductivehealthtopicsunsafe_abortionenindexhtml" />  According to WHO statistics, the risk rate for unsafe abortion is 1/270; according to other sources, unsafe abortion is responsible for one in eight maternal deaths.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nour NM |title=An Introduction to Maternal Mortality |journal=Reviews in Ob Gyn |year=2008 |volume=1 |pages=77–81}}</ref> Worldwide, 48% of all induced abortions are unsafe.

The British Medical Journal reported in 2003 that 70,000 women a year die from unsafe abortion, equivalent to an airplane crash killing 400 women of reproductive age every few days and noting that such a crash would be reported as a tragic event with wide news coverage. The paper pointed out that deaths of women from unsafe abortion equal 168 such plane crashes every year and deserve our attention.<ref name="grimes2>

An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and unsafe abortion a "silent [[pandemic]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets."<ref name="who2">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html</ref> The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,<ref>http://www.who.int/hrp/en/</ref> has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four interrelated activities:<ref name="who2" />
*to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
*to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
*to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;
*and to assist in the development of programmes and policies that reduce unsafe abortion and improve access to safe abortion and highquality postabortion care

A 2007 study published in the ''[[The Lancet]]'' found that, although the global rate of abortion declined from 45.6 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003, unsafe procedures still accounted for 48% of all abortions performed in 2003. It also concluded that, while the overall incidence of abortion in both developed and developing countries is approximately equal, unsafe abortion occurs more often in less-developed nations.<ref>{{cite journal

==Conflating illegal and unsafe abortion==
Unsafe abortions often occur [[abortion law|where abortion is illegal]].<ref name="Rosenthal2007"/> However, the prevalence of unsafe abortion may also be determined by other factors, such as whether it occurs in a [[developing country]] that has a low level of competent medical care,<ref>Chaudhuri, S.K.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=pzanxKlcU74C&pg=PA259&dq=%22unsafe+abortion%22+and+%22developing+countries%22+and+95%25&hl=en&ei=1it8TeG-HYa8lQfT-um6BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22unsafe%20abortion%22%20and%20%22developing%20countries%22%20and%2095%25&f=false Practice Of Fertility Control: A Comprehensive Manual]'', 7th Edition, page 259 (Elsevier India, 2007).</ref> and whether modern [[contraceptives]] are available.<ref name="Singh"/><ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=1yMIYcjB3IIC&pg=PA50&dq=%22Unsafe+abortion%22+illegal+contraceptives&hl=en&ei=Tgl8Tf-lA8bh0gGK0qTXAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=major%20contribution&f=false The World Health Report 2005: Make Every Mother and Child Count]'', page 50 (World Health Organization 2005): "A major contribution of contraception to reducing maternal death and disability is through its potential to decrease unsafe abortions."</ref>

Unsafe abortions sometimes occur where abortion is legal, and safe abortions sometimes occur where abortion is illegal.<ref>Faúndes, Aníbal and Barzelatto, José.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=U89BF625xcwC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=%22abortion+are+common+terms+that+are+used+frequently+in+international+documents%22&source=bl&ots=FA-Ke1KTkZ&sig=cXyuHK0xV7yk4vPDPv09RK_JyII&hl=en&ei=iCl8Tbm9LIX7lwfH1NHlBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22abortion%20are%20common%20terms%20that%20are%20used%20frequently%20in%20international%20documents%22&f=false The Human Drama of Abortion: a Global Search for Consensus]'', page 21 (Vanderbilt University Press 2006).</ref>  Legalization is not always followed by elimination of unsafe abortion.<ref name="WHO-unsafe-2007">{{cite web | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | year = 2007 | accessdate = March 7, 2011 | format = PDF | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596121_eng.pdf |quote= In several countries, the legalization of abortion has not been followed by elimination of unsafe abortion.|title = Unsafe abortion: Global and regional estimates of the incidence of unsafe abortion and associated mortality in 2003}}</ref><ref name=Blas>Blas, Erik et al.

When abortion is illegal, that generally contributes to the prevalence of unsafe abortion, but it is not the only contributor.  In addition, a lack of access to safe and effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion. It has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by as much as 73% without any change in abortion laws if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally.<ref name=Singh />

Illegality of abortion contributes to [[maternal mortality]], but that contribution is not as great as it once was, due to medical advances including [[penicillin]] and the [[birth control pill]].<ref>[http://factcheck.org/article336.html “Abortion Distortions: Senators from both sides make false claims about Roe v. Wade”], FactCheck.org (2005-08-22): "Sen. Boxer claimed that overturning Roe v. Wade would cost the lives of more than 5,000 pregnant women a year. That might have been true before the invention of penicillin and the birth control pill, but it's not true now. The best evidence indicates that the annual deaths from illegal abortions would number in the hundreds, not thousands."</ref>

In 2011, [[Kermit Gosnell]], a licensed doctor who provided abortion services in the American state of [[Pennsylvania]], was indicted by a grand jury on murder charges after a woman died in his clinic.

==Methods==

Methods of unsafe abortion include:
*Trying to break the [[amniotic sac]] inside the [[womb]] with a sharp object or wire (for example an unbent wire [[clothes hanger]] or [[knitting needle]]). This method can result in infection or injury to internal organs (for example perforating the [[uterus]] or [[intestines]]), resulting in death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soubiran|first=Andre|title=Diary of a Woman in White|publisher=Avon Books|year=1969|edition=English|pages=98–99}} citing {{Cite book|title=Fatal Abortions|author=Henri Modnor|authorlink=Henri Mondor|year=1935}}</ref> The uterus softens during pregnancy and is very easy to pierce, so one traditional method was to use a large feather.<ref name=avery-family>{{cite book

*Inducing an abortion without medical supervision by self-administering [[abortifacient]] over-the-counter drugs or drugs obtained illegally or by using drugs not indicated for abortion but known to result in miscarriage or uterine contraction. Drugs that cause [[uterine contraction]]s include [[oxytocin]] (synthetic forms are [[Pitocin]] and [[Syntocinon]]), [[prostaglandin]]s, and [[ergot alkaloid]]s. Risks include [[uterine rupture]], [[irregular heartbeat]], a rise in blood pressure [[hypertension]], a drop in blood pressure ([[hypotension]], [[anemia]] requiring [[blood transfusion|transfusion]], cardiovascular problems, [[pulmonary edema]], and death, as well as intense [[bronchospasm]]s in women with [[asthma]]. <ref name=uterine>Rastegari E.C., Uretsky S.

==Illegal abortion==
An illegal abortion may be called a "back-alley", "backstreet", or "back-yard" abortion.

The wire [[Clothes hanger|coat hanger]] method was a popularly known illegal abortion procedure, although they were not the norm.  In fact, Mary Calderone, former medical director of [[Planned Parenthood]], said, in a 1970 printing of the ''American Journal of Public Health'':

"Abortion is no longer a dangerous procedure. This applies not just to therapeutic abortions as performed in hospitals but also to so-called illegal abortions as done by physician. In 1957 there were only 260 deaths in the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind, second, and even more important, the conference [on abortion sponsored by Planned Parenthood] estimated that 90 percent of all illegal abortions are presently being done by physicians. Whatever trouble arises usually arises from self-induced abortions, which comprise approximately 8 percent, or with the very small percentage that go to some kind of non-medical abortionist. Abortion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous, because it is being done well by physicians." 

[[Herbalism|Herbal]] abortions (when done illegally) can also be described as an unsafe abortions because they are not induced in a medical facility.

==Controversy==

The matter of unsafe abortions in America received public attention leading up to the legal proceedings of [[Roe v. Wade]], the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion in America.  Since then, it has become a central argument on the part of some prominent legal abortion advocates.  The publication in ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine of a photo of [[Gerri Santoro]], who died of blood loss following an unsafe abortion, was used extensively to illustrate the dangers of illegal abortions.
