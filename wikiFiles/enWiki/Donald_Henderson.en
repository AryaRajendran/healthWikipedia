'''Donald Ainslie Henderson''', known as '''D.A. Henderson''', (born September 7, 1928) is an American [[physician]] and [[epidemiologist]], who headed the international effort during the 1960s to eradicate [[smallpox]]. {{As of|2010}}, he is a Distinguished Scholar at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's]] [[Center for Biosecurity of UPMC|Center for Biosecurity]] and a professor of public health and medicine at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He is also a Johns Hopkins University Distinguished Service Professor and Dean Emeritus of the School of Public Health, with a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Henderson was born in [[Lakewood, Ohio]] in the United States. He graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1950 and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[University of Rochester|University of Rochester School of Medicine]] in 1954. He served both an internship (1954–1955) and a residency (1957–1959) in medicine at the [[Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital]] in [[Cooperstown]], [[New York]]. He earned an M.P.H. degree in 1960 from the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] (now the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]).

Between his internship and residency (1955–1957) and again from 1960–1966, he worked in the [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Communicable Disease Center]] (CDC; now the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), where he created a Smallpox Surveillance Unit to deal with imports of the disease into the USA.

===Eradication of smallpox===

In 1966 Henderson moved to [[Geneva]] to head the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Campaign]]. Smallpox was at the time [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in Brazil, Africa and South Asia. 

In 1972 Henderson helped suppress an [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia]], the last epidemic of smallpox in Europe. In 1974 he was stationed in [[India]] during one of the [[1974 smallpox epidemic of India|largest epidemics in the 20th century]] and was instrumental in initiating the global program of [[immunization]]. This program has vaccinated 80 percent of the world's children against six major diseases and is striving to eradicate [[poliomyelitis]]. 

The smallpox eradication campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1977 when the last case was reported in [[Somalia]]. It thus became the first infectious disease to be wiped out.

===Later work===
From 1977 through August 1990, Henderson was [[dean (education)|dean]] of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. His government service was first as associate director, [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]], [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]] (1991–1993), and later as deputy assistant secretary and senior science advisor in the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HSS). He is also currently a senior advisor to the federal government and the HHS on civilian [[biodefense]] issues. He rejoined the faculty of Johns Hopkins in June 1995 after five years of federal government service.

In October 2001, [[Tommy Thompson|Tommy G. Thompson]], Secretary of Health and Human Services, named Henderson [[Chair (official)|chair]] of a new national advisory council on public health preparedness which is charged with improving the national public health infrastructure to better counter [[bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] attacks. As the principal science advisor for public health preparedness in HHS and chair of the Secretary's Council on Public Health Preparedness, Henderson is in charge of coordinating department-wide response to public health emergencies. He was also the founding director in 1998 of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, which he has directed for the past four years, and has numerous publications to his credit.[http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/faculty/detail.cfm?id=122&Lastname=Henderson&Firstname=Donald]

Henderson Collection at Johns Hopkins spans his entire career there, including newspaper articles, honors, biographical material, lecture notes, speeches, and correspondence as well as awards such as the Japan Prize and the Public Welfare Medal. Presently, he is a Professor and Resident Scholar at the Center for Biosecurity of the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]], which has created a professorship honoring him as of September 26, 2004.
