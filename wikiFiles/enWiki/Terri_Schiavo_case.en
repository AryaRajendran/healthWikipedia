The '''Terri Schiavo case''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ʃ|aɪ|v|oʊ}}) was a legal struggle involving prolonged life support in the [[United States]] that lasted from 1998 to 2005. The issue was whether to carry out the decision of the husband of Teresa Marie "Terri" Schiavo to terminate life support for her. Terri was diagnosed by doctors as being in a [[persistent vegetative state]]. The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents and by state and federal legislative intervention effected a seven-year delay before life support finally was terminated.

Terri Schiavo collapsed in her [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], home in full [[cardiac arrest]] on February 25, 1990. She suffered massive [[brain damage]] due to [[hypoxia (medical)|lack of oxygen]] and, after two and a half months in a [[coma]], her diagnosis was changed to [[persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]]. For the next few years doctors attempted speech and physical therapy and other experimental therapy, hoping to return her to a state of awareness. In 1998 Schiavo's husband, Michael, petitioned the [[Florida Circuit Courts|Sixth Circuit Court of Florida]] ([[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]]), to remove her feeding tube pursuant to [[Florida Statutes]] Section 765.401(3).<ref>{{cite web

On February 25, 2005, a Pinellas County judge ordered the removal of Terri Schiavo's feeding tube. Several appeals and federal government intervention followed, which included [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] returning to Washington D.C. to sign legislation designed to keep her alive. After all attempts at appeals through the federal court system upheld the original decision to remove the feeding tube, staff at the [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]] hospice facility where Terri was being cared for disconnected the feeding tube on March 18, 2005, and she died on March 31, 2005.
In all, the Schiavo case involved 14 appeals and numerous [[motion (legal)|motions]], petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in [[United States district court|federal district court]]; Florida legislation struck down by the [[Supreme Court of Florida]]; federal legislation (the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]]); and four denials of ''[[certiorari]]'' from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web

==Background==
{{Terri Schiavo}}

===Early life===
Terri Schiavo was born Teresa Marie Schindler on December 3, 1963, in [[Lower Moreland Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]]. Overweight throughout her childhood, as a teenager Terri stood 5' 3" (160&nbsp;cm) tall and weighed {{convert|200|lb|kg}}. Through dieting she had lost {{convert|65|lb|kg}} by the time she attended college.<ref name="UStoday">{{cite news|title=Schiavo case highlights eating disorders|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-02-25-schiavo-eating-disorder_x.htm|accessdate=28 November 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=February 26, 2005}}</ref>   She attended [[Bucks County Community College]], where she met Michael Schiavo in 1982. The two began dating and were married on November 10, 1984. They moved to [[Florida]] in 1986, following Terri's parents. Michael worked as a restaurant manager, while Terri took up a job with an insurance company.<ref name="WashPostFrey">{{cite news|last=Frey|first=Jennifer|title=Terri Schiavo's Unstudied Life|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64459-2005Mar24.html|accessdate=30 July 2010|newspaper=Washington Post|date=25 March 2005}}</ref>

===Initial medical crisis{{spaced ndash}}1990===
In the early morning of February 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo collapsed in a hallway of her [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], apartment. Firefighters and [[paramedics]] arriving in response to her husband Michael's [[9-1-1]] call found her face-down and unconscious. She was not breathing and had no [[pulse]]. They attempted to resuscitate her and she was transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. There, she was [[intubation|intubated]] and [[Mechanical ventilation|ventilated]].<ref name="wolfson" />

====Initial medical assessments====
Her medical chart contained a note that "she apparently has been trying to keep her weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of [[iced tea]]."<ref name="UStoday" /> Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from [[hypokalemia]] (low potassium levels): her serum [[potassium]] level was an abnormally low 2.0&nbsp;[[Equivalent (chemistry)|mEq]]/[[litre|L]] (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0&nbsp;mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal.<ref name="SilentWitness">{{cite book | title = Silent Witness | author = Mark Fuhrman | publisher = William Morrow | date=2005-06-28 | isbn = 0-06-085337-9}}  p67</ref> [[Electrolyte disturbance|Electrolyte imbalance]] is often caused by [[water intoxication|drinking excessive fluids]]. A serious consequence of hypokalemia can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including [[sudden arrhythmia death syndrome]].<ref name="quote">Meyer  J, et al.

Terri was eventually switched from being fed by a [[nasogastric intubation|nasogastric feeding tube]] to a [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]] (PEG) feeding tube.<ref>{{cite news

Dr. Garcia J. DeSousa, a [[American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry|board-certified]] [[neurologist]] in St. Petersburg, Florida, who previously treated Terri Schiavo, cared for her during her initial admission to Humana Northside; both he and Dr. Victor Gambone, an internist and Schiavo family physician, independently made the diagnosis of [[persistent vegetative state]] (PVS) within approximately one year after her sudden [[cardiac arrest]].<ref>{{cite journal| last = Cranford | first = Ronald | title = Facts, Lies, and Videotapes: The Permanent Vegetative State and The Sad Case of Terri Schiavo | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics | pages = 363–371 | date = Summer 2005 | accessdate = Nov 22, 2012 }}</ref>

===Relationship between Terri's husband and parents===
From 1990 to 1993, Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers (Terri Schiavo's parents) enjoyed an amicable relationship,<ref>[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/justices/pariente.shtml Pariente, Barbara, Chief Justice] (for The Court).

===Rehabilitation efforts{{spaced ndash}}1990-1993===
In November 1990, Michael Schiavo took Terri to the [[University of California, San Francisco]] for experimental nerve stimulation{{spaced ndash}}the [[Thalamic stimulator]]. The treatment took several months but was unsuccessful. He returned to Florida with her in January 1991 and admitted her as an inpatient to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center in [[Bradenton, Florida]]. On July 19, 1991, Terri Schiavo was transferred to the Sabal Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular [[speech therapy|speech]] and [[occupational therapy]] until 1994.<ref name=abstract>[http://www.miami.edu/index.php/ethics/projects/schiavo/schiavo_timeline/ Schiavo Timeline, Part 1  1963 to 2003] [[University of Miami School of Law]]</ref> In mid 1993, Michael Schiavo requested a [[do not resuscitate]] order for her after she contracted a urinary tract infection.  The court-appointed [[guardian ad litem]], Jay Wolfson, later wrote a report stating that Michael Schiavo's decision was "predicated on his reasoned belief that there was no longer any hope for Terri's recovery."<ref name="wolfson">{{cite web

==Legal cases 1992-2002==

===Malpractice===
In 1992 Michael filed a [[malpractice]] suit against Terri's [[obstetrician]] on the basis that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility.<ref>Greer, George W., Circuit Judge. [http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder02-00.pdf "IN RE: THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THERESA MARIE SCHIAVO, Incapacitated,"] File No. 90-2908GD-003, ''[http://jud6.org/ Fla. 6th Judicial Circuit],'' February 11, 2000</ref> Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped [[Menstruation|menstruating]] but the doctor had failed to take her medical history which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, reduced to $2 million because Terri was partly at fault for her condition.<ref name="UStoday"/> After attorneys’ fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri’s medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003, the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.<ref name=abstract />

===Petition to remove feeding tube===
On June 18, 1990, the court appointed Michael Schiavo as Terri Schiavo's legal guardian; this appointment was not disputed by the Schindlers at the time.<ref name="wolfson" /> In May 1998, Michael Schiavo filed a petition to remove Terri Schiavo's feeding tube, which her parents opposed. Richard Pearse was appointed by the court as a second [[guardian ad litem|guardian ad litem (GAL)]], and on December 29, 1998, reported "Dr. Jeffrey Karp's opinion of the [[Ward (law)|ward's]] condition and prognosis is substantially shared among those physicians who have recently been involved in her treatment." Pearse concluded from Karp's and Dr. Vincent Gambone's diagnosis of PVS that Schiavo was legally in a persistent vegetative state as defined by Florida Statutes, Title XLIV, Chapter 765, [[§]]101(12). This includes the "absence of voluntary action" and an "inability to communicate or interact purposefully."<ref name="pearse">{{cite web

Pearse found that there was no possibility of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a [[living will]] and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.<ref name="pearse" />

===''Schiavo I'': end-of-life wishes===
Given the lack of a [[living will]], a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge [[George Greer]] during the week of January 24, 2000, to determine what Terri Schiavo's wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures.<ref name="greer-02-00"/> Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney [[George Felos]], who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in 1990.<ref name="Browning AP">{{cite web|title=Florida Woman Dies Attached to a Tube; Legal Fight Goes On|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/us/florida-woman-dies-attached-to-a-tube-legal-fight-goes-on.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 19, 1989}}</ref><ref name="Browning Schiavo">{{cite web|last=Levesque|first=William R.|title=Right-to-die law defined by local case|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/13/Tampabay/Right_to_die_law_defi.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=October 13, 2003}}</ref> 

The trial included testimony from eighteen witnesses regarding her medical condition and her end-of-life wishes. Michael Schiavo claimed that his wife would not want to be kept on a machine where her chance for recovery was minuscule. According to Abstract Appeal Trial Order, her parents "claimed that Terri was a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] who would not wish to violate the Church's teachings on [[euthanasia]] by [[Patient refusal of nutrition and hydration|refusing nutrition and hydration]]." Judge Greer issued his order granting the petition for authorization to discontinue artificial life support for Terri Schiavo in February 2000. In this decision, the court found that Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state and that she had made reliable oral declarations that she would have wanted the feeding tube removed.<ref name="greer-02-00">{{cite web

===Oral feeding and the Second Guardianship Challenge===
In March 2000, the Schindlers filed a motion to permit oral feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to [[swallowing|swallowing tests]] and required a feeding tube,<ref name="wolfson" /> Judge Greer ruled that she was not capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request.<ref>{{cite web

In 2000, the Schindlers again challenged Michael Schiavo's guardianship. The Schindlers suggested that he was wasting the assets within the guardianship account by transferring Terri Schiavo to a [[Pinellas Park, Florida]] [[hospice care|hospice]] "after it was clear that she was not 'terminal' within Medicare guidelines" for hospices. By this time, while still legally married to Terri Schiavo, Michael Schiavo was in a relationship with Jodi Centonze, and had fathered their first child. He said he chose not to divorce his wife and relinquish guardianship because he wanted to ensure her final wishes (not to be kept alive in a PVS) were carried out. The court denied the motion to remove the guardian, allowing that the evidence was not sufficient and in some instances, not relevant. It set April 24, 2001 as the date on which the tube was to be removed.<ref>{{cite web

===''Schiavo II''===
In April 2001, the Schindlers filed a motion for relief from judgment citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.<ref>{{cite web

On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging [[perjury]], which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo filed a motion to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion.

On August 10, 2001, on remand from the [[Florida Second District Court of Appeal]], Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers claiming that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself would be able to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to [[recuse]] himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition.

In October 2002, on [[remand (court procedure)|remand]] by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function.  In preparation for the trial, a new [[computed axial tomography]] scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe [[cerebral atrophy]]. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a [[radiology|radiologist]], and four [[neurology|neurologist]]s: Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]], Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.<ref>{{cite news

The five doctors examined Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Drs. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis testified that Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state. Drs. Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified that she was in a [[minimally conscious state]]. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri "clearly does not consistently respond to her mother". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips showing reactions and emotions, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to public websites.<ref>{{cite news

Around the start of 2003, the Schindlers began to create more publicity by lobbying for their case to keep their daughter alive. They selected pro-life activist [[Randall Terry]] as their spokesman and continued to pursue their available legal options. On September 11, 2003, the Schindlers petitioned the court to forestall removal of the feeding tube to provide for "eight weeks' therapy". Accompanying the petition were four affidavits from members of the Schindler family and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon. At the hearing, the Schindlers' counsel read into the record additional affidavits from three speech professionals and two nurses. Nurse Carla Sauer Iyer asserted that she was able to feed Terri Schiavo orally but that Michael Schiavo characterized any such interaction as "therapy" and ordered her not to do so. Iyer claimed in her affidavit that her initial training in 1996 consisted solely of the instruction, "Do what Michael Schiavo tells you or you're terminated," and that standing orders were not to contact the Schindler family, but that she "would call them anyway". She also claimed that Michael said, "When is that bitch gonna die?" According to Iyer, on five different occasions she tested Terri Schiavo's [[blood sugar]] levels after Michael visited and found that Terri's blood sugar levels were so low they wouldn't even register. She claims that she eventually called the police and was fired the next day.<ref name=Iyer /> Despite her claims that she called the Schindlers multiple times in 1996, there is no evidence the Schindlers did anything at the time to demand that the nursing home or police investigate the supposed incidents. Nor did they [[subpoena]] Iyer during their 2000 court battle with Michael.

On September 17, 2003 Judge [[George Greer]] denied the petition, and wrote that "the Petition is an attempt by Mr. and Mrs. Schindler to re-litigate the entire case. It is not even a veiled or disguised attempt. The exhibits relied upon by them clearly demonstrate this to be true." Regarding (Nurse) Iyer's<ref name=Iyer>{{cite web

==Terri's Law and other government delays==
{{Main|Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case}}

On October 15, 2003, Schiavo's feeding tube was removed. Within a week, when the Schindlers' final appeal was exhausted, State Rep. [[Frank Attkisson]] and the [[Florida Legislature]] hastily passed "Terri's Law," giving Governor [[Jeb Bush]] the authority to intervene in the case. Governor Bush immediately ordered the feeding tube reinserted. Governor Bush sent the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] (FDLE) to remove Schiavo from the hospice. She was taken to Morton Plant Rehabilitation Hospital in Clearwater, where her feeding tube was surgically reinserted.<ref>{{cite web

 | author = Bury, Chris | publisher = [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC News]] | date = 2005-03-15 | accessdate = 2006-02-21}}</ref> She was then returned to the hospice. Part of the legislation required the appointment of a [[guardian ad litem|guardian ad litem (GAL)]], Dr. Jay Wolfson, to "deduce and represent the best wishes and best interests" of Schiavo, and report them to Governor Bush. Wolfson's report did not change Michael's role as her legal guardian and did not otherwise obstruct him legally.<ref name="wolfson" />

Michael Schiavo opposed the Governor's intervention in Schiavo's case, and was represented, in part, by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU). At the same time, Robert and Mary Schindler, her parents, attempted to intervene and participate in the "Terri's Law" case but were denied by Judge W. Douglas Baird, a Circuit Judge in the Florida Sixth Circuit, the same circuit as for Judge George W. Greer. They appealed, and, on February 13, the [[Florida District Courts of Appeal|Florida Second District Court of Appeal]] (Second District Court of Appeals) reversed Baird's ruling, allowing them to participate. On March 17, Baird denied the Schindlers the right to intervene a second time,<ref>{{cite web

On February 28, 2005 the Schindlers filed a motion, asking for permission to attempt to provide Schiavo with "Food and Water by Natural Means." This second motion asked for permission to "attempt to feed" Schiavo by mouth.<ref>{{cite web

Greer noted that "most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo's condition from news reports or video clips they have seen. Many are obviously not aware of the medical exams undertaken for the 2002 trial..."<ref name = "Greer-PDF6th"/>

Following Greer's order on March 18, 2005 to remove the feeding tube, Republicans in the [[United States Congress]] [[subpoena]]ed both Michael and Terri Schiavo to testify at a congressional hearing.<ref>{{cite web

===Palm Sunday Compromise===
{{Main|Palm Sunday Compromise}}
[[George W Bush|President Bush]] and Congressional Republicans anticipated Greer's adverse ruling well before it was delivered and worked on a daily basis to find an alternative means of overturning the legal process by utilizing the authority of the [[United States Congress]]. On March 20, 2005, the Senate, by [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate|unanimous consent]], passed their version of a relief bill; since the vote was taken by voice vote, there was no official tally of those voting in favor and those opposed. Soon after Senate approval, the House of Representatives passed an identical version of the bill S.686, which came to be called the "[[Palm Sunday Compromise]]" and transferred jurisdiction of the Schiavo case to the federal courts. The bill passed the House on March 21, 2005 at 12:41 a.m. ([[UTC-5]]). [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] flew to [[Washington, D.C.]] from his vacation in [[Texas]] in order to sign the bill into law at 1:11 a.m. 

While the bill had been proposed by Republican Senators [[Rick Santorum]] and [[Mel Martinez]], it also had the support of Democratic Senator [[Tom Harkin]] due to [[disability rights]] concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].<ref name="disability rights"/> American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left,<ref name="disability rights"/> however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise.<ref name="Congress Debate"/> According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.<ref name="disability rights"/>

As in the state courts, all of the Schindlers' federal petitions and appeals were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant [[certiorari]], effectively ending the Schindlers' judicial options. At the same time, the so-called [[Schiavo memo]] surfaced, causing a political firestorm. The memo was written by [[Brian Darling]], the legal counsel to Florida Republican senator [[Mel Martinez]]. It suggested the Schiavo case offered "a great political issue" that would appeal to the party's [[base (politics)|base]] (core supporters) and could be used against Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Florida]], because he had refused to co-sponsor the bill.<ref>{{cite news

==Final local motions, death and autopsy==
On March 24, 2005, Judge Greer denied a petition for intervention by the Department of Children & Families (DCF) and signed an order forbidding the department from "taking possession of Theresa Marie Schiavo or removing her" from the hospice and directed "each and every and singular sheriff of the state of Florida" to enforce his order. The order was appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law. While the stay was in effect, Florida Department of Law Enforcement personnel prepared to take custody of Terri and transfer her to a local hospital for reinsertion of the feeding tube. Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. Governor Bush decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right. If Bush (or the Florida Legislature) had ignored Greer's order by attempting to remove her from the hospice, a confrontation between the Pinellas Park Police Department and the FDLE agents could have ensued. In jest, one official said local police discussed "... whether we had enough officers to hold off the National Guard."<ref>{{cite news

Terri Schiavo died at a [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]] [[Palliative care|hospice]] on March 31, 2005. Although there was concern that Schiavo would experience significant symptoms from [[dehydration]] with the removal of the feeding tube, studies have shown that patients who have their feeding tubes removed, such as the case of Schiavo, usually have a peaceful death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lallanilla|first=Marc|title=Death from Dehydration Is Usually Serene|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Schiavo/story?id=531907&page=1|accessdate=16 July 2011|newspaper=ABC News|date=March 18, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hook CC, Mueller PS |title=The Terri Schiavo saga: the making of a tragedy and lessons learned |journal=Mayo Clin.

After her death, Schiavo's body was taken to the Office of the District 6 Medical Examiner for Pinellas and Pasco counties, based in Largo, Fla. The [[autopsy]] occurred on April 1, 2005. It revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as "undetermined". The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin, M.D. In addition to consultation with a neuropathologist (Stephen J. Nelson, M.D.), Dr. Thogmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report<ref name="thogmartin" /> was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo’s nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, M.D., revealed extensive injury. The [[human brain|brain]] itself weighed only {{convert|615|g|abbr=on}}, only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all [[List of regions in the human brain|brain regions]], including the [[cerebral cortex]], the [[thalamus|thalami]], the [[basal ganglia]], the [[hippocampus]], the [[cerebellum]], and the [[midbrain]]. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal [[Betz cell|neuron]]s that comprise some 70% of cortical cells – critical to the functioning of the cortex – were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen from the front of the cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalami) – another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, "irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons."<ref>{{cite news

The cardiac pathologist who studied Schiavo's heart found it and the [[coronary circulation|coronary vessels]] to be healthy, which excludes the possibility that her initial collapse was the result of [[myocardial infarction]], although there was a localized area of healed inflammation (opening the possibility of [[myocarditis]]). Thogmartin found that "there was no proof that Terri Schiavo ever had an eating disorder such as bulimia." Regarding the possibility of strangulation or domestic violence as a cause of Schiavo's initial collapse, the report states: "No trauma was noted on any of the numerous physical exams or radiographs performed on Mrs. Schiavo on the day of, in the days after, or in the months after her initial collapse. Indeed, within an hour of her initial hospital admission, radiographic examination of her cervical spine was negative. Specifically, external signs of strangulation including cutaneous or deep neck injury, facial/conjunctival petechiae, and other blunt trauma were not observed or recorded during her initial hospital admission. Autopsy examination of her neck structures 15 years after her initial collapse did not detect any signs of remote trauma, but, with such a delay, the exam was unlikely to show any residual neck findings."

Regarding the cause and manner of Schiavo’s death, Thogmartin wrote, "Mrs. Schiavo suffered severe anoxic brain injury. The cause of which cannot be determined with reasonable medical certainty. The manner of death will therefore be certified as undetermined."<ref name="thogmartin" />

"We were not surprised the medical examiner said Terri's brain was damaged," said Bobby Schindler, Jr., her brother, in an interview hours after the autopsy report was released. "The fact that the medical examiner ruled out bulimia and ruled out a heart attack, without a doubt, adds more questions."<ref>{{cite web

The Schiavo case differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. The case instead involved a dispute between family members over what Schiavo's wishes would have been for such a situation. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, "The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over the last quarter of the 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan."<ref name="M Stonecipher"/>

The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, ''Guardianship of Estelle Browning''.<ref name="Browning Schiavo"/><ref name="Browning TBO">{{cite news|last=Sommer|first=David|title=Schiavo Case Could Cause Change In Law|url=http://news.tbo.com/news/MGA1IEYHYLD.html|accessdate=November 30, 2012|newspaper=Tampa Bay Online|date=October 19, 2003}}</ref> In that case, George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo in the Schiavo case, represented a Browning relative. Felos successfully argued before the [[Florida Supreme Court]] that Browning's feeding tube should be removed. The elderly Browning had expressed in a living will her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water "by a gastric tube or intravenously." At that time it was common to remove people from respirators, but the law in Florida wasn't clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a landmark ruling, the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had "the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one's health."<ref name="Browning Schiavo"/>

===Disability rights===
During the years of legal proceedings, [[disability rights]] groups and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability rights groups, led by [[Not Dead Yet]], along with four other amici, filed an [[amicus curaie]] brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube.<ref name="amicus brief">{{cite web|last=Townsend|first=Liz|title=Disability Rights Groups File Amicus Brief in Terri Schiavo Case'' {{Subscription required{{!}}via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98775346.html|publisher=National Right to Life News|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}</ref> They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.<ref name="disability rights"/><ref name="Congress Debate">{{cite news|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|title=Congress Ready to Again Debate End-of-Life Issues|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/politics/28cong.html?pagewanted=print&position=&_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2005}}</ref>  
They argued that [[persistent vegetative state]] is frequently misdiagnosed, and that the reasons for withdrawal of life support from a patient should be scrutinized since even family member surrogates can have conflicts of interest. The [[Palm Sunday Compromise]] granted the federal review they sought, but it was limited to only the Schiavo case.<ref name="disability rights"/>

Two [[opinion poll|polls]] conducted shortly after Schiavo's feeding tube was removed for the final time in 2005 showed that a large majority of [[United States|Americans]] believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the [[United States Congress]] overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/25/opinion/lynch/main683233.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Schiavo Politics, Up Close | date=March 25, 2005}}</ref> However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2005/03/schaivo_push_po.html | title=SCHIAVO "PUSH POLL?" | author=Mark Blumenthal | publisher=Mystery Pollster | date=2005-03-23 | accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zogby.com/news/2005/04/06/80-non-terminal-patients-should-not-be-denied-food-water-three-to-one-feeding-tube-should-stay-in-pl/|title=80%: Non-Terminal Patients Should Not be Denied Food, Water; Three-to-One: Feeding Tube Should Stay in Place When Wishes Unknown; Americans Divided on Intervention by Elected Officials|author=unsigned|publisher=Zogby International|date=2005-04-06|accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref>

==Developments since Schiavo's death==
Since Terri Schiavo's death in March 2005, Michael Schiavo and her family have clashed a number of times. Each side has also worked to promote their own causes related to the case. In April 2005, the families disagreed over Schiavo's burial. The Schindlers had wanted her body to be buried in Florida, while Michael Schiavo said at the time that he would cremate her body and then have her ashes buried in her home state of [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Parents Hold Funeral Mass for Terri Schiavo|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,152578,00.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=April 6, 2005}}</ref> In June 2005, however, Schiavo's ashes were buried in Florida instead. The words "I kept my promise" were included on the marker, referring to his promise to follow what he said was her wish not to be kept alive artificially. The statement angered the Schindlers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Even in Death, Acrimony over Schiavo|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8299372/ns/us_news/t/even-death-acrimony-over-schiavo/|publisher=Associated Press|date=June 21, 2005}}</ref> 

In December 2005, Michael Schiavo created a [[political action committee]], TerriPAC. It was formed to raise money to support right-to-die candidates and oppose candidates who had voted for government involvement in the Schiavo case.<ref name="TerriPAC OS">{{cite web|last=Lytle|first=Tamara|title=Schiavo turns rage into TerriPAC|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-12-08/news/SCHIAVO08_1_weldon-feeding-tube-congressional-action|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=December 8, 2005}}</ref> In 2007, TerriPAC paid a $1350 fine to [[Federal Election Commission]] for failing to file complete and timely records.<ref name="Timeline 2">[http://www.miami.edu/index.php/ethics/projects/schiavo/schiavo_timline2/ Schiavo Timeline, Part 2  2004 to present], [[University of Miami School of Law]].</ref> Schiavo shut down the PAC later that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=TerriPAC, from the Internet Archive|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071010233255/http://www.terripac.com/|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>

The Schindlers continued operation of the Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation, with a new goal of helping individuals in situations similar to Terri's. In April 2010, Michael Schiavo charged that the Schindlers were improperly using Terri's name, as he held the rights to it, and that the family was using the foundation in order to make money. A Florida television station looked at the foundation's tax records and found that for 2008, it paid 64% of the $91,568 it raised in salaries to Terri's father, Robert Schindler, Sr., her sister, Suzanne Vitadamo, and her brother, Robert Schindler, Jr. Their attorney said the foundation does its work effectively and that the high percentage for salaries was due to the small amount of money the foundation raises. He also said that the Schindlers had the right to use Terri's name as she is a public figure.<ref name="TSSF dispute">{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Jake|title=Terri Schiavo's Family Profiting From Foundation

In 2006, both Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers released books telling their sides of the story. Schiavo's was called ''Terri: The Truth'', while the Schindlers' was titled ''A Life that Matters: The Legacy of Terri Schiavo - A Lesson for Us All''.<ref name="Schiavo books">{{cite web|last=Neuman|first=Clayton|title=Another Schiavo Skirmish|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1177007,00.html|publisher=Time.com|date=March 27, 2006}}</ref>
