'''Max Joseph Oertel''' (March 20, 1835 - July 17, 1897) was a [[Germany|German]] physician. He developed a system for the correction of [[respiratory failure|respiratory troubles]], and invented the [[larynx|laryngeal]] [[stroboscope]].

==Biography==
Oertel was a native of [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]]. In 1863 he obtained his medical doctorate from the [[University of Munich]], where he spent the following four years as assistant to [[Karl von Pfeufer]] (1806-1869). In 1867 he received his habilitation, attaining a professorship at [[Munich]] in 1876.<ref>[http://www.zeno.org/Pagel-1901/A/Oertel,+Max+Joseph Pagel Biographical Dictionary] (biography)</ref>

He is credited with being the first physician to use a laryngeal [[stroboscope]] for examination of the [[larynx]]. He combined a stroboscopic lamp with a laryngeal [[mirror]] in order to study "vocal movements" in different registers. Application of the [[strobe light]] allowed him to view the vibrating [[vocal cord]]s in slow motion, thus enabling detailed views of the larynx in an open or closed position. 

Oertel was the author of a number of written works on [[cardiac disease|cardiac]], [[circulatory disease|circulatory]] and [[obesity]] disorders, and was an early advocate of the "terrain cure", a set of [[therapeutic]] exercises that involved graduated hiking and climbing.

Oertel made contributions to the study of [[diphtheria]] by reproducing the disease in laboratory rabbits.
