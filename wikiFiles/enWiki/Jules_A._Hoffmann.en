'''Jules A. Hoffmann''' (born 2 August 1941) is a Luxembourgish-born French<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1912.htm |title=CNRS senior researcher Jules Hoffmann awarded 2011 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine |publisher=[[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref> biologist. He is a research director and member of the board of administrators of the National Center of Scientific Research ([[CNRS]]) in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. In 2007, he became President of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. Together with [[Bruce Beutler]], Hoffmann received one-quarter of the 2011 [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] for "their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity."<ref name="Nobel">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2011|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|date=3 October 2011}}</ref>

Hoffmann and Bruno Lemaitre discovered the function of the fruit fly ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' gene in [[innate immunity]]. Its mammalian homologs, the [[Toll-like receptor]]s, were discovered by Beutler. Toll-like receptors identify constituents of other organisms like fungi and bacteria, and trigger an immune response, explaining e.g. how [[septic shock]] can be triggered by bacterial remains.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111003/full/478013a.html |title=Nobel announcement marred by winner's death |doi=10.1038/478013a |author=Callaway E |journal=Nature |date=3 October 2011}}</ref> The plant homologs were discovered by [[Pamela Ronald]] in 1995 (rice XA21)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Song, W.Y. et al.| title = A receptor kinase-like protein encoded by the rice disease resistance gene, XA21 |journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5243 | pages = 1804–1806| year = 1995 | pmid = 8525370| doi = 10.1126/science.270.5243.1804}}</ref> and Thomas Boller in 2000 (Arabidopsis FLS2).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gomez-Gomez, L. et al.| title = FLS2: an LRR receptor-like kinase involved in the perception of the bacterial elicitor flagellin in Arabidopsis |journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1003–1011| year = 2000 | pmid = 10911994| doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80265-8}}</ref>

==Education==
Hoffmann received undergraduate degrees in biology and chemistry at the [[University of Strasbourg]], France. In 1969, he completed his Ph.D. in biology also at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. His post-doctoral training was at the Institut für Physiologische Chemie at [[Philipps-Universität Marburg|Philipps-Universität]] in [[Marburg an der Lahn]], [[Germany]] in 1973–1974.

==Research==
Hoffmann was a research assistant at CNRS from 1964 to 1968, and became a research associate in 1969. Since 1974 he has been a Research Director of CNRS. Between 1978 and 2005 he was Director of the CNRS research unit "Immune Response and Development in Insects", and from 1994 to 2005 he was director of the [[Institut de biologie moléculaire et cellulaire|Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology]] of CNRS in Strasbourg.

Hoffmann is a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]], the [[French Academy of Sciences]], the [[Academia Europaea]], the [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO), the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].
