The '''lumbricals''' are intrinsic [[muscle]]s of the [[hand]] that [[flexion|flex]] the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s and [[extension (kinesiology)|extend]] the [[Interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joints]].<ref name = Gosling97>[[#Gosling|Gosling ''et al.'' 2008, p. 97]]</ref>

==Structure==
There are four of these small, worm-like muscles on each hand. These muscles are unusual in that they do not attach to bone. Instead they attach proximally to the tendons of [[flexor digitorum profundus]] and distally to the [[extensor expansion]]s.<ref name = Gosling97/>

{| class="wikitable"
| '''#''' || '''Form''' || '''Origin''' || '''Insertion'''
 |- 
 | first || [[unipennate]] || It originates from the radial side of the most radial tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus (corresponding to the index finger).  || It passes posteriorly along the radial side of the index finger to insert on the [[extensor expansion]] near the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]].
 |- 
 | second  || unipennate || It originates from the radial side of the second most radial tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus (which corresponds to the middle finger).   || It passes posteriorly along the radial side of the middle finger and inserts on the extensor expansion near the metacarpophalangeal joint.
 |- 
 | third || [[bipennate]] || One head originates on the radial side of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon corresponding to the ring finger, while the other originates on the ulnar side of the tendon for the middle finger.   || The muscle passes posteriorly along the radial side of the ring finger to insert on its extensor expansion.
 |- 
 | fourth || bipennate || One head originates on the radial side of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon corresponding to the little finger, while the other originates on the ulnar side of the tendon for the ring finger.   || The muscle passes posteriorly along the radial side of the little finger to insert on its extensor expansion.

==Innervation==
The first and second lumbricals (the most radial two) are innervated by the [[median nerve]].
The third and fourth lumbricals (most ulnar two) are innervated by the [[deep branch of the ulnar nerve]].

This is the usual innervation of the lumbricals (occurring in 60% of individuals).  However 1:3 (median:ulnar - 20% of individuals) and 3:1 (median:ulnar - 20% of individuals) also exist.  The lumbrical innervation always follows the innervation pattern of the associated muscle unit of flexor digitorum profundus (i.e. if the muscle units supplying the tendon to the middle finger are innervated by the median nerve, the second lumbrical will also be innervated by the median nerve).<ref>Last's Anatomy - Regional and Applied, 10th ed.  Chummy S. Sinnatamby, pg. 64 and pg. 82.</ref>

==Blood supply==
There are four separate sources of blood supply for these muscles: the [[superficial palmar arch]], the [[common palmar digital artery]], the [[deep palmar arch]], and the [[dorsal digital artery]].

==Actions==
The lumbrical muscles, with the help of the interosseous muscles, simultaneously flex the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s while extending both [[Interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joint]]s of the digit on which it inserts. The lumbricals are used during an upstroke in writing.

==Other lumbricals==
There are also [[lumbrical muscle of the foot|lumbrical muscles of the foot]] that have a similar action, though these are of less clinical concern.
