==Management techniques==
CFS management techniques include behavioral interventions such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT, a form of psychological therapy), and [[graded exercise therapy]] (GET). Based on evidence from multiple randomized clinical trials (RCTs), a systematic review published in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' (October 2006) stated that CBT and GET interventions showed promising results, appearing to reduce symptoms and improve function. The review stated that the evidence of effectiveness was inconclusive for most other interventions, with some reporting significant adverse effects. The wide variety of outcome measures used in CFS research was found to be a "fundamental problem" for assessing the effectiveness of interventions in general, and no intervention has proven to be effective in restoring the ability to work.<ref name=cbt_systematic_review>{{cite journal |author=Chambers D, Bagnall AM, Hempel S, Forbes C |title=Interventions for the treatment, management and rehabilitation of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: an updated systematic review |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=99 |issue=10 |pages=506–20 |year=2006 |pmid=17021301 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.10.506 |pmc=1592057}}</ref>

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
According to the cognitive-behavioural model of illness, the patient's interpretation of symptoms plays an important role in shaping their behaviour and perpetuating the illness. There are two main cognitive-behavioural hypotheses for CFS. The weak hypothesis assumes that CFS is irreversible and that CBT can help the patient cope with the illness better. The strong hypothesis says that CFS is entirely reversible and that the illness is perpetuated only by the patient's cognitions, behaviour and emotions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mark A. Demitrack, Susan E. Abbey |title=Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: An Integrative Approach to Evaluation and Treatment |publisher=Guilford Press|year=1999 |pages=248 |isbn=1-57230-499-5, 9781572304994 |doi=}}</ref>

The first trial finding the efficacy of CBT for CFS was published in 1996 by Sharpe and colleagues in Oxford.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8555852</ref> More recently a systematic review of RCTs found that there is moderate evidence of benefit for CBT in CFS, but that the effectiveness of CBT for CFS outside of specialist settings has been questioned and the quality of the evidence is low.<ref name=cbt_bmj_clinical_evidence>[http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com/ceweb/conditions/msd/1101/1101_I1.jsp Chronic fatigue syndrome - Musculoskeletal disorders - BMJ Clinical Evidence]</ref> A 2008 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review of CBT concluded, "''CBT is more effective than usual care for reducing fatigue symptoms in adults with CFS, with 40% of participants assigned to CBT showing clinical response at post-treatment, in comparison with 26% assigned to usual care control.''", however, it also stated that the benefits of CBT in sustaining clinical response at follow up are inconclusive, and there were no conclusive improvements to physical functioning, depression, anxiety or psychological distress at either post treatment or later follow-up. Data on adverse effects were not systematically presented by any included study. The review also concluded that while the quantity and quality of the evidence has grown in recent years "there is a surprising lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments to inform the development of clinical management programmes for people with CFS".<ref name="CochraneCBT">{{cite journal |author=Price JR, Mitchell E, Tidy E, Hunot V |title=Cognitive behaviour therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome in adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD001027 |year=2008 |pmid=18646067 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Price |editor1-first=Jonathan R}}</ref> One uncontrolled study with no follow-up found that CBT could facilitate full recovery in some patients, with 69% of the patient cohort no longer meeting the CDC criteria for CFS and "full recovery" occurring in 23% of CFS patients after CBT using the most comprehensive definition of recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Knoop H, Bleijenberg G, Gielissen MF, van der Meer JW, White PD |title=Is a full recovery possible after cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome? |journal=Psychother Psychosom |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=171–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17426416 |doi=10.1159/000099844 |url=}}</ref>

Another systematic review on CBT<ref name="cbt_systematic_review"/> finds that "CBT was associated with a significant positive effect on fatigue, symptoms, physical functioning and school attendance.", but had not proved to be effective in restoring the ability to work. The reviewers state that the quality of many recent trials on CBT are lower quality [[randomized controlled trial]]s or trials that did not involve random allocation. The reviewers also state that one recent, good quality trial of CBT in children and adolescence supports the effectiveness of CBT. The reviewers state that reasons for withdrawals typically remain unreported, and that a degree of publication bias seems to be present in CFS/ME literature as a whole. In one study, the effect of CBT has been demonstrated up to five years after therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deale A, Husain K, Chalder T, Wessely S |title=Long-term outcome of cognitive behavior therapy versus relaxation therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=12 |pages=2038–42 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11729022 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2038|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11729022}}</ref>

A 2007 meta-analysis found that the effectiveness of CBT depends on the diagnostic criteria used, with studies using the Oxford criteria having a trend towards significantly higher effect sizes that those using the CDC criteria. The review also notes that CBT for chronic fatigue disorders has about the same efficacy as diverse psychological treatments for a variety of psychological disorders.<ref name=Malouffsystematic/>

A 2010 meta-analysis of trials that measured physical activity before and after CBT showed that although CBT effectively reduced fatigue, activity levels were not improved by CBT and changes in physical activity were not related to changes in fatigue. They conclude that the effect of CBT on fatigue is not mediated by a change in physical activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wiborg JF, Knoop H, Stulemeijer M, Prins JB, Bleijenberg G |title=How does cognitive behaviour therapy reduce fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome?

According to a 2006 systematic review, "very few studies have assessed the effectiveness of interventions for children and young people and for severely affected patients. The effectiveness of CBT for adolescents is supported by a recent high-quality RCT, although this had only 69 participants." Currently there is no research into the effectiveness of CBT for the severely affected, and these patients may be effectively excluded from trials due to the need to attend a clinic.<ref name="cbt_systematic_review"/> Some CBT trials suffer from large dropout rates, up to 42% in one study, with a mean dropout rate of 16%. This compares to a 17% dropout rate in a trial of 432 patients receiving CBT for anxiety, "so is not unusually high" according to a 2007 meta-analysis.<ref name=Malouffsystematic>{{cite journal |author=Malouff JM |title=Efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome: a meta-analysis |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=736–45 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18060672 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.10.004 |url= |author-separator=, |display-authors=1 |last2=Thorsteinsson |first2=Einar B. |last3=Rooke |first3=Sally E. |last4=Bhullar |first4=Navjot |last5=Schutte |first5=Nicola S.}}</ref>

A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that both CBT and GET are both equally efficacious treatments for CFS, but that CBT may be a more effective treatment when patients have comorbid anxiety or depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Castell|first=Bronwyn D.|coauthors=Kazantzis, Nikolaos; Moss-Morris, Rona E.|title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Graded Exercise for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|date=1 December 2011|volume=18|issue=4|pages=311–324|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2011.01262.x}}</ref>

====Group CBT====

A systematic study conducted at the behest of the Belgian government of over 800 CFS patients treated in four reference centers which tested CBT and GET in a clinical setting concluded that although patient motivation for treatment seemed to be high and that in 71% the supervising team considered the patient to have reached their maximal capacity, "No patient had been cured. Therapy provided systematically included CBT and GET. After treatment duration of 41 to 62 hours of rehabilitation per patient of which 83% group based, spread over 6 to 12 months, patients’ subjective feelings of fatigue were improved, but results concerning quality of life were equivocal. Psychological problems or psychiatric co-morbidities improved, but still fell outside the range of healthy adults. Physical capacity did not change; employment status decreased at the end of the therapy." The report noted that "It is difficult however, to judge these results, since no control group had been included."<ref>https://kce.fgov.be/sites/default/files/page_documents/d20081027358.pdf</ref> 

A 2008 Cochrane systematic review included 4 studies which used group CBT and concluded that it was less effective than individual CBT at reducing fatigue at post-treatment.<ref name="CochraneCBT"/> A 2007 meta-analysis stated that the one included study which tested group CBT had produced a similar effect to the other studies using individual CBT.<ref name=Malouffsystematic/> In a more recent study of a multidisciplinary intervention which combined group CBT and GET with pharmacological treatment, at 12 months after completion this intervention was "slightly inferior" to usual care alone, resulting in no improvements to fatigue or health related quality of life, and worse physical function and bodily pain scores.<ref name="PMID 21234629">{{cite journal | author = Núñez M, Fernández-Solà J, Nuñez E, Fernández-Huerta JM, Godás-Sieso T, Gomez-Gil E | title = Health-related quality of life in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: group cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise versus usual treatment.

==== Alternatives to CBT ====

A study which included 45 CFS patients found that [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic counselling]] has comparable effectiveness to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of chronic fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ridsdale L |title=Chronic fatigue in general practice: is counselling as good as cognitive behaviour therapy?

===Graded exercise therapy===

Two systematic reviews cautiously conclude that some patients may benefit from graded exercise therapy (GET), although there are some limitations with the evidence and the generalizability of the findings.<ref name="cbt_systematic_review"/><ref name="PMID 15266475">{{cite journal | author = Edmonds M, McGuire H, Price J | title = Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume= | issue = 3 | pages = CD003200 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15266475 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003200.pub2 | url = http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD003200/frame.html | editor1-last = Price | editor1-first = Jonathan R}}</ref>

A 2004 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] systematic review included 5 eligible studies on GET and found statistically significant improvements to self-reported fatigue severity and physical functioning. This benefit was sustained after 6 months but became non-significant compared to the control group who did not receive GET. Functional work capacity was not significantly improved. GET had a tendency towards higher dropout rates, and although there was no evidence that exercise therapy worsened outcomes on average, no data was reported for adverse effects. The authors state that the evidence base and the precision of the results are limited, and encourage higher quality studies "that involve different patient groups and settings, and that measure additional outcomes such as adverse effects, quality of life and cost effectiveness over longer periods of time".<ref name="PMID 15266475"/>

A 2006 systematic review published in the [[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]] included 5 eligible studies on GET and found an overall effect in the reduction of symptoms and improvement to physical functioning. GET had not been proven to restore the ability to work. Withdrawals were noted in some GET studies but difficult to interpret due to the poor reporting of adverse effects. The protocols for many clinical studies may have biased the sample towards those with less severe symptoms, and severely affected patients were not included in the studies of GET. The authors state the need for research to "define the characteristics of patients who would benefit from specific interventions and to develop clinically relevant objective outcome measures."<ref name="cbt_systematic_review"/>

A [[New Zealand]] study suggests that GET may result in self-reported improvement in part by "reducing the degree to which patients focus on their symptoms."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moss-Morris R, Sharon C, Tobin R, Baldi JC |title=A randomized controlled graded exercise trial for chronic fatigue syndrome: outcomes and mechanisms of change |journal=J Health Psychol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=245–59 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15723894 |doi=10.1177/1359105305049774 |url=}}</ref> To avoid detrimental effects from GET, care must be taken to avoid the exacerbation of symptoms while catering the program to individual capabilities and the fluctuating nature of symptoms.<ref name="PMID 18382818">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2340/16501977-0185 | author = Nijs J, Paul L, Wallman K | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome: an approach combining self-management with graded exercise to avoid exacerbations | journal = J Rehabil Med | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–7 | year = 2008 | month = April | pmid = 18382818 | url = }}</ref>

====Pragmatic rehabilitation====

Pragmatic rehabilitation is "a programme of gradually increasing activity designed collaboratively by the patient and the therapist". In response to an earlier successful trial, a larger trial was conducted, known as [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/4/9 Fatigue Intervention by Nurses Evaluation]. In the FINE trial, patients fulfilling [[Clinical_descriptions_of_chronic_fatigue_syndrome#Oxford_1991_criteria|Oxford 1991 CFS criteria]] who were allocated to pragmatic rehabilitation reported a statistically significant but "clinically modest" improvement in fatigue when compared to patients allocated to either "supportive listening" or "treatment as usual", but after 12 months follow-up there were no statistically significant differences. There was no significant improvement to physical functioning at any time. About 10% of the trial participants were non-ambulatory and about 30% met [[Clinical descriptions of chronic fatigue syndrome#London criteria|London ME criteria]], but separate results for these groups were not published.<ref name="PMID 20418251">{{cite journal | author = Wearden AJ, Dowrick C, Chew-Graham C, Bentall RP, Morriss RK, Peters S, Riste L, Richardson G, Lovell K, Dunn G; Fatigue Intervention by Nurses Evaluation (FINE) trial writing group and the FINE trial group.

Pacing techniques encourage behavioral change, but unlike cognitive behavioural therapy, acknowledges the typical patient fluctuations in symptom severity and delayed exercise recovery.<ref name="PMID_16781183">{{cite journal |author=Nijs J, Meeus M, De Meirleir K |title=Chronic musculoskeletal pain in chronic fatigue syndrome: recent developments and therapeutic implications |journal=Man Ther |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=187–91 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16781183 |doi=10.1016/j.math.2006.03.008 |url=}}</ref> Patients are advised to set manageable daily activity/exercise goals and balance their activity and rest to avoid possible over-doing which may worsen their symptoms.

===PACE trial===

The PACE trial was a large-scale five-year trial funded by the UK government which compared the efficacy and safety of four treatments: specialist medical care (SMC), SMC with CBT, SMC with GET, and SMC with adaptive pacing therapy (APT). The results were published in February 2011 and showed that CBT and GET were, when combined with SMC, each "moderately" effective compared to SMC alone. APT was not found to be effective when added to SMC.<ref>http://www.pacetrial.org/faq.html</ref><ref name="pmid21334061">{{cite pmid|21334061}}</ref>

Out of 3158 potential participants screened for eligibility, about 80% of candidates were excluded and 641 patients meeting the Oxford criteria for CFS were recruited. 160 were assigned to the APT group, 161 to the CBT group, 160 to the GET group and 160 to the SMC group. SMC alone reduced mean fatigue scores by 4.5, SMC with CBT reduced scores by 7.4 and SMC with GET reduced scores by 7.6.  The addition of APT made no statistical difference. Physical functioning scores were also improved by CBT and GET compared to APT or SMC alone.

All patients met Oxford criteria, and when further stratified into groups of patients that also met the international CDC criteria and/or the [[Clinical descriptions of chronic fatigue syndrome#London criteria|London criteria]] for ME, a subgroup analysis found no significant differences in outcomes between the groups - in all cases CBT and GET resulted in statistically significant moderate improvements compared to SMC alone or APT.

Average 6 minute walking distance scores improved in the SMC alone group from 314 to 334 meters. The SMC plus CBT group showed no additional improvement over SMC alone. The SMC plus GET group walked an additional 35 meters. This increase was small compared to the distance walked by healthy elderly people, which was shown in one study to be 631 meters.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kewley AJ | title = The PACE trial in chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1832; author reply 1834–5 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 21592552 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60681-8/fulltext | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60681-8}}</ref> 

CBT was done on the basis of the fear avoidance theory of chronic fatigue syndrome. This theory regards CFS as being reversible and that cognitive responses (fear of engaging in activity) and behavioural responses (avoidance of activity) are linked and interact with physiological processes to perpetuate fatigue. The aim of treatment was to change the behavioural and cognitive factors assumed to be responsible for perpetuation of the participant’s symptoms and disability.<ref name="pmid21334061"/>

Graded exercise therapy (GET) was done on the basis of deconditioning and exercise intolerance theories of chronic fatigue syndrome. These theories assume that CFS is perpetuated by reversible physiological changes of deconditioning and avoidance of activity; these changes result in the deconditioning being maintained and an increased perception of effort during exertion and increased symptoms after unaccustomed activity, leading to further inactivity. The aim of treatment was to help the participant gradually return to appropriate physical activities, reverse the deconditioning, and thereby reduce fatigue and disability.<ref name="pmid21334061"/>

The trial reported that CBT and GET were "safe". A serious adverse event was defined as either: death, life-threatening, hospitalisation, increased severe disability for at least 4 weeks duration, any episode of deliberate self-harm. Serious adverse reactions to the therapies were recorded in two (1%) of the 159 patients in the APT group, three (2%) of the 161 patients in the CBT group, 2 (1%) of the 160 patients in the GET group and two (1%) of the 160 patients in the SMC group.

Limitations of the trial included: patients younger than 18 years of age and those not able to attend hospital were excluded; and as with any therapy trial, participants, therapists, doctors, and research assessors were not masked to treatment allocation, resulting in an [[Blind experiment|unblinded trial]]. The authors note that the primary outcomes were subjective and rated by participants, which could be subject to biases.

[[Controversies related to chronic fatigue syndrome#PACE trial|The trial generated a furious response]] from patient groups and campaigners. [[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]] critiqued the definitions of secondary outcomes, questioned protocol changes, and expressed concern over generalisability of the results. Professor Malcolm Hooper branded the results "unethical and unscientific" and submitted a 442 page response to the Medical Research Council and a shorter 43-page complaint to the Lancet. The MRC and the Lancet have considered the submissions and rejected them. A Lancet editorial conjectured that the strong negative response might be due to the dismay over the debilitating illness, "but also from an active campaign to discredit the research."<ref name="PMID 21592553">{{cite journal | author = [No authors listed] (Editorial) | title = Patients' power and PACE | journal = Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1808 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 21592553 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60696-X | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960696-X/fulltext}}</ref><ref name="PMID 21697226">{{cite journal | author = Hawkes N | title = (Editorial) Dangers of research into chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | issue = | pages = d3780 | year = 2011 | month = June | pmid = 21697226 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3780 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3780.extract}}</ref>

An analysis was done to determine the proportion of patients who recovered after each type of treatment during the PACE trial. Two measures of "recovery" were used: "trial recovery", meaning that the patient was in the normal range for fatigue and physical function, didn't meet the Oxford definition for CFS, and had a self-rated overall health score of "much better" or "very much better". The second measure of recovery, "clinical recovery", required that the patient not meet the CDC criteria for CFS or the London criteria for ME (in addition to the criteria for "trial recovery"). The figures for meeting "trial recovery" were: 22% after CBT, 22% after GET, 8% after APT and 7% after SMC. For "clinical recovery" the figures were very similar. The study only looked at recovery from the "current episode of the illness", and the CDC criteria were modified to only look at symptoms in the past week rather than the previous six months. According to the authors, "Our finding that 22–56% of participants met various composite or single criteria for recovery or improvement a year after starting either CBT or GET is therefore consistent with previously published studies. The NNT of 7 for recovery after both CBT and GET is within the range of the effects found for drug treatments in both general medical and psychiatric conditions"<ref>{{cite journal|last=White|first=P.

Another paper examined cost-effectiveness and changes in service usage. Both CBT and GET passed common criteria for [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]], and also had a higher probability of being the most cost-effective when compared to the APT and SMC groups. APT was not found to be cost-effective. However, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in measures for employment/production losses and total service/societal usage or costs. Moreover, welfare benefits or other financial payments increased for all groups during the trial, with no significant differences between groups. These latter costs were excluded from the cost-analyses, but the authors still reported them "given that they are important financial outlays".<ref name="PMID 22870204">{{cite journal |author= McCrone P, Sharpe M, Chalder T, Knapp M, Johnson AL, Goldsmith KA, White PD |title= Adaptive pacing, cognitive behaviour therapy, graded exercise, and specialist medical care for chronic fatigue syndrome: a cost-effectiveness analysis |journal= PLoS ONE |volume= 7 |issue=8 |pages= e40808 |year= 2012 |month= August |pmid= 22870204 |url= http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0040808 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0040808 |editor1-last= Van Baal |editor1-first= Pieter H.

===Hormones===
Treatment with [[steroids]] such as [[cortisol]] and [[thyroid]] hormones{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} has been studied. 

There have been 7  RCT’s, four trialling [[hydrocortisone]], 2 with [[fludrocortisone]] and one with hydrocortisone  plus fludrocortisone .  Two RCT’s have found overall benefit for hydrocortisone, but it has not been recommended for clinical use.

A 2006 systematic review found one low-quality RCT of hydrocortisone which found a significant difference between groups for fatigue, but two other RCTs found no benefit for steroid treatment.<ref name="pmid17021301">{{cite journal |author=Chambers D, Bagnall AM, Hempel S, Forbes C |title=Interventions for the treatment, management and rehabilitation of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: an updated systematic review |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=99 |issue=10 |pages=506–20 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17021301 |pmc=1592057 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.10.506 |url=}}</ref>

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind therapeutic trial, conducted between 1992 and 1996 in a tertiary care research institution. 70 patients  met the CDC criteria many comorbid with psychiatric diagnosis but who withheld concomitant treatment with other medications.

====Carnitine====
L-[[Carnitine]] is an [[amino acid]] which includes ALC, a group of natural compounds that have an important role in cellular function.

====Essential fatty acids====
A randomized controlled trial on patients diagnosed with post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) and deficient RBC levels, using [[essential fatty acids]] consisting of [[evening primrose oil]] containing n-6 GLA together with fishoil concentrate containing  n-3 EPA and DHA showed significant overall improvement in symptoms and RBC essential fatty acid levels.<ref name="pmid2270749">{{cite journal |author=Behan PO, Behan WM, Horrobin D |title=Effect of  high doses of essential fatty acids on the postviral fatigue syndrome |journal=Acta Neurol.

====Vitamin B12====
Both oral and injected [[Vitamin B12]] have been suggested as treatments for generalized fatigue since the 1950s, however recent studies do not suggest any benefit from it, either for generalized fatigue or CFS specifically. Further research is needed, however, as studies to date have been small and used inconsistent dosing regimens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/585589|title=Does Vitamin B12 Help Relieve Fatigue?|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref>

==Placebo response==

It was previously assumed that placebo response rates in patients with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] (CFS) are unusually high, "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. However, a meta-analysis found that the pooled response rate in the placebo group was 19.6%, lower than the usually reported one third response in other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood to be difficult to treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates in the placebo group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response, low patient and provider expectations regarding psychological treatment may explain particularly low placebo responses to psychiatric treatments.<ref name=Cho2005>{{cite journal | author = Cho HJ, Hotopf M, Wessely S | title = The placebo response in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis| journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 301–13| publisher = | year = 2005 | pmid =15784798| url = http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/67/2/301 | accessdate = 2008-12-12 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000156969.76986.e0}}</ref>
