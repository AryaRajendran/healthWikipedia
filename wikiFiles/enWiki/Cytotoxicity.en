'''Cytotoxicity''' is the quality of being [[toxicity|toxic]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Examples of toxic agents are a [[chemical substance]], an [[immune cell]] or some types of [[venom]] (e.g. from the [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]] or [[brown recluse spider]]).

==Cell physiology==
Treating cells with the cytotoxic compound can result in a variety of cell fates. The cells may undergo [[necrosis]], in which they lose membrane integrity and die rapidly as a result of [[cell lysis]]. The cells can stop actively growing and dividing (a decrease in cell viability), or the cells can activate a genetic program of controlled cell death ([[apoptosis]]).

Cells undergoing necrosis typically exhibit rapid swelling, lose membrane integrity, shut down metabolism and release their contents into the environment. Cells that undergo rapid necrosis in vitro do not have sufficient time or energy to activate apoptotic machinery and will not express apoptotic markers.<ref name=viability> Promega Corporation (2006) [http://www.promega.com/paguide/chap4.htm Protocols and Applications Guide.

==Measuring cytotoxicity==

Cytotoxicity assays are widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for cytotoxicity in compound libraries. Researchers can either look for cytotoxic compounds, if they are interested in developing a therapeutic that targets rapidly dividing cancer cells, for instance; or they can screen "hits" from initial high-throughput drug screens for unwanted cytotoxic effects before investing in their development as a pharmaceutical.

Assessing cell membrane integrity is one of the most common ways to measure cell viability and cytotoxic effects. Compounds that have cytotoxic effects often compromise cell membrane integrity. Vital dyes, such as [[trypan blue]] or propidium iodide are normally excluded from the inside of healthy cells; however, if the cell membrane has been compromised, they freely cross the membrane and stain intracellular components.<ref name="riss1"/> Alternatively, membrane integrity can be assessed by monitoring the passage of substances that are normally sequestered inside cells to the outside. One molecule, [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), is commonly measured using [[LDH assay]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Decker T, Lohmann-Matthes ML |title=A quick and simple method for the quantitation of lactate dehydrogenase release in measurements of cellular cytotoxicity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity |journal=J. Immunol. Methods |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=61–9 |year=1988 |month=November |pmid=3192948 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1759(88)90310-9|url=}}</ref> Protease biomarkers have been identified that allow researchers to measure relative numbers of live and dead cells within the same cell population. The live-cell protease is only active in cells that have a healthy cell membrane, and loses activity once the cell is compromised and the protease is exposed to the external environment. The dead-cell protease cannot cross the cell membrane, and can only be measured in culture media after cells have lost their membrane integrity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Niles AL, Moravec RA, Eric Hesselberth P, Scurria MA, Daily WJ, Riss TL |title=A homogeneous assay to measure live and dead cells in the same sample by detecting different protease markers |journal=Anal. Biochem. |volume=366 |issue=2 |pages=197–206 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17512890 |doi=10.1016/j.ab.2007.04.007 |url=}}</ref>

Cytotoxicity can also be monitored using the 3-(4, 5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide ([[MTT assay|MTT]]) or MTS assay. This assay measures the reducing potential of the cell using a colorimetric reaction. Viable cells will reduce the MTS reagent to a colored [[formazan]] product. A similar redox-based assay has also been developed using the fluorescent dye, resazurin. In addition to using dyes to indicate the redox potential of cells in order to monitor their viability, researchers have developed assays that use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] content as a marker of viability.<ref name=riss1/> Such ATP-based assays include bioluminescent assays in which ATP is the limiting reagent for the [[luciferase]] reaction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fan F, Wood KV |title=Bioluminescent assays for high-throughput screening |journal=Assay Drug Dev Technol |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=127–36 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17355205 |doi=10.1089/adt.2006.053 |url=}}</ref> 

Cytotoxicity can also be measured by the [[sulforhodamine B]] (SRB) assay, WST assay and [[clonogenic assay]].

A label-free approach to follow the cytotoxic response of adherent animal cells in real-time is based on electric impedance measurements when the cells are grown on gold-film electrodes. This technology is referred to as [[electric cell-substrate impedance sensing]] (ECIS). Label-free real-time techniques provide the kinetics of the cytotoxic response rather than just a snapshot like many colorimetric endpoint assays.

==Immune system cytotoxicity==

''[[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]'' (''ADCC'') describes the cell-killing ability of certain [[lymphocyte]]s, which requires the target cell being marked by an [[antibody]]. ''Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity'', on the other hand, does not have to be mediated by antibodies; nor does ''complement-dependent cytotoxicity'' (''CDC''), which is mediated by the [[complement system]].

Three groups of cytotoxic [[lymphocyte]]s are distinguished:
* [[Cytotoxic T cell]]s
* [[Natural killer cell]]s
* [[Natural killer T cell]]s
