The '''Dietary Reference Intake''' ('''DRI''') is a system of [[nutrition]] recommendations from the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. The DRI system is used by both the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and is intended for the general public and health professionals.  Applications include:

* Composition of diets for schools, prisons, hospitals or nursing homes
* Industries developing new food stuffs
* Healthcare policy makers and public health officials

The DRI was introduced in 1997 in order to broaden the existing guidelines known as Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). The DRI values are not currently used in [[nutrition labeling]], where the older [[Reference Daily Intake]]s are still used.

==History==

The '''Recommended Dietary Allowance''' ('''RDA''') was developed during [[World War II]] by Lydia J. Roberts, [[Hazel Stiebeling]], and Helen S. Mitchell, all part of a committee established by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in order to investigate issues of nutrition that might "affect national defense" (Nestle, 35).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harper AE |title=Contributions of women scientists in the U.S. to the development of Recommended Dietary Allowances |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=133 |issue=11 |pages=3698–702 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14608098 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/133/11/3698}}</ref> The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, for civilians, and for overseas population who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for "energy and eight nutrients", and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, 35). The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, were accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a "margin of safety." Because of food [[rationing]] during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens' nutritional intake also took food availability into account.

The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In the early 1950s, [[United States Department of Agriculture]] nutritionists made a new set of guidelines that also included the number of servings of each food group in order to make it easier for people to receive their RDAs of each nutrient.

==Current recommendations==

The current Dietary Reference Intake recommendation is composed of:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/reference/cons_info-guide_cons-eng.php  |title=A Consumer's Guide to the DRIs (Dietary Reference Intakes)  |publisher=Health Canada  |date=2010-11-29  |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

* '''Estimated Average Requirements''' (EAR), expected to satisfy the needs of 50% of the people in that age group based on a review of the scientific literature.
* '''Recommended Dietary Allowances''' (RDA), the daily dietary intake level of a nutrient considered sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board to meet the requirements of 97.5% of healthy individuals in each life-stage and gender group.  It is calculated based on the EAR and is usually approximately 20% higher than the EAR (See "Calculating the RDA", below).
* '''Adequate Intake''' (AI), where no RDA has been established, but the amount established is somewhat less firmly believed to be adequate for everyone in the demographic group.
* '''Tolerable upper intake levels''' (UL), to caution against excessive intake of nutrients (like [[vitamin A]]) that can be harmful in large amounts. This is the highest level of daily consumption that current data have shown to cause no side effects in  humans when used indefinitely without medical supervision.

The RDA is used to determine the Recommended Daily Value (RDV) which is printed on food labels in the U.S. and Canada.

EARs, RDA/AIs and ULs for an average healthy 25-year old male are shown below.  EARs shown as "NE" have not yet been established or not yet evaluated.  ULs shown as "ND" could not be determined, and it is recommended that intake from these nutrients be from food only, to prevent adverse effects.  Amounts and "ND" status for other age and gender groups, pregnant women, lactating women, and breastfeeding infants may be much different.<ref name=IOM>{{citation

==Calculating the RDA==

The equations used to calculate the RDA are as follows:

"If the [[standard deviation]] (SD) of the EAR is available and the requirement for the nutrient is [[normal distribution|symmetrically distributed]], the RDA is set at two SDs above the EAR:

RDA = EAR + 2 SD(EAR).

If data about [[variability]] in requirements are insufficient to calculate an SD, a [[coefficient of variation]] (CV) for the EAR of 10 percent is assumed, unless available data indicate a greater variation in requirements. If 10 percent is assumed to be the CV, then twice that amount when added to the EAR is defined as equal to the RDA. The resulting equation for the RDA is then

RDA = 1.2 × EAR.

This level of intake statistically represents 97.5 percent of the requirements
of the population."<ref>{{harvnb|Panel on Micronutrients|2001}}</ref>

==Recent developments==
In September 2007, the Institute of Medicine held a workshop entitled “The Development of DRIs 1994–2004: Lessons Learned and New Challenges.”<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12086 ''The Development of DRIs 1994–2004: Lessons Learned and New Challenges. Workshop Summary'', November 30, 2007]</ref>  At that meeting, several speakers stated that the current Dietary Recommended Intakes (DRI’s) were largely based upon the very '''lowest''' rank in the [[Evidence strength|quality of evidence pyramid]], that is, opinion, rather than the highest level – randomized controlled clinical trials.  Speakers called for a higher standard of evidence to be utilized when making dietary recommendations.
