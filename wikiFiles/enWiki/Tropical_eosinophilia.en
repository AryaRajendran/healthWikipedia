'''Tropical (pulmonary) eosinophilia''', or TPE, is characterized by [[cough]]ing, [[asthma]]tic attacks, and an enlarged [[spleen]], and is caused by  ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'', a [[filaria]]l infection.  It occurs most frequently in [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Tropical eosinophilia is considered a manifestation of a species of [[microfilaria]]. This disease can be confused with [[tuberculosis]],<ref name="urlPulmonary Eosinophilia">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301070-overview |title=Pulmonary Eosinophilia |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref> asthma, or coughs related to [[roundworm]]s.<ref name="urlICD-10:">{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gj80.htm+j82 |title=ICD-10 Classification |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref>

Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is a rare, but well recognised, syndrome characterised by pulmonary interstitial infiltrates and marked peripheral eosinophilia.<ref name="Yong">{{cite pmid|17908009}}</ref> This condition is more widely recognised and promptly diagnosed in filariasis-endemic regions, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Asia and South America. In nonendemic countries, patients are commonly thought to have bronchial asthma.<ref name="Boggild">{{cite pmid|15486834}}</ref><ref name="Jiva">{{cite pmid|8833995}}</ref> Chronic symptoms may delay the diagnosis by up to five years.<ref name="Boggild"/>  Early recognition and treatment with the antifilarial drug, diethylcarbamazine, is important, as delay before treatment may lead to progressive interstitial fibrosis and irreversible impairment.<ref name="Ong">{{Cite pmid|9631810}}</ref>

The condition of marked eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement was first termed tropical pulmonary eosinophilia in 1950.<ref name="Ball">{{cite pmid|14809749}}</ref>   The syndrome is caused by a distinct hypersensitive immunological reaction to microfilariae of'' W. bancrofti'' and ''[[Brugia malayi]]''.<ref name="Ong"/><ref name="Udwaida">{{cite book|author=Udwaida F.|chapter=Tropical eosinophilia|editor=Herzog H|title=Pulmonary eosinophilia: progress in respiration research|location=Basel, Switzerland|publisher=Karger|year=1975|pages=35–155}}</ref>  However, only a small percentage (< 0.5%)<ref name="WHO">{{cite pmid|1441569}}</ref> of the 130 million people globally who are infected with [[filariasis]] apparently develop this reaction. The clearance of rapidly opsonised microfilariae from the bloodstream results in a hypersensitive immunological process and abnormal recruitment of eosinophils, as reflected by extremely high IgE levels of over 1000 kU/L.<ref name="Ong"/><ref name="Ottensen">{{cite pmid|1580599}}</ref>  The typical patient is a young adult man from the Indian subcontinent.<ref name="Udwaida"/>

==Symptoms==
A persistent or recurrent cough that gets aggravated at night, weakness, [[weight loss]] and a low [[fever]] raises the possible diagnosis of this disease. Some children with this disease may also have enlarged [[lymph node]]s in the neck and elsewhere. Others may [[hemoptysis|cough up a little blood]] and may also have a wheeze.<ref name="urlPulmonary Eosinophilia"/>

==Diagnosis==
The [[diagnostic criteria]] for tropical pulmonary eosinophilia <ref name="Ottensen"/>  include:
*a history supportive of exposure to [[lymphatic]] [[filariasis]];
*a peripheral [[eosinophilia]] count greater than 3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L);
*an elevated serum [[IgE]] levels (> 1000 kU/L);
*increased titers  of [[filariasis|antifilarial]] [[antibodies]];
*peripheral blood negative for [[microfilariae]]; and
*a clinical response to [[diethylcarbamazine]].

High antifilarial IgG titers to microfilariae often result in cross reactivity with other nonfilarial [[helminth]] [[antigens]],<ref name="Muck">{{cite pmid|12886811}}</ref> <ref name="Magnaval">{{cite pmid|15712096}}</ref> such as strongyloides and schistosoma antigens, as demonstrated in reported cases. It is important to exclude other parasitic infections before tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is diagnosed, by serological tests, examination of stool specimens in a laboratory experienced in parasitic infections, or a trial of anthelminthic medication. Other parasitic infections, such as the [[zoonotic]] filariae, [[dirofilariasis]], [[ascariasis]], [[strongyloides]], visceral larva [[migrans]] and [[hookworm]] disease, may also be confused with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia because of overlapping clinical features, serological profile and response to diethylcarbamazine.<ref name="Ong"/><ref name="Ottensen"/><ref name="Magnaval"/><ref name="Kuzucu">{{cite pmid|16582677}}</ref> Radiological findings are nonspecific, with normal appearance on chest X-ray in up to 20% of patients.<ref name="Udwaida"/>  Lung biopsy is not part of the routine diagnostic workup of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.<ref name="Yong">{{cite pmid|17908009}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The dramatic response to a commonly used drug for filaria ([[diethylcarbamazine]]) almost confirms the diagnosis. No universal treatment guidelines have been established for tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. <ref name="Boggild"/> The antifilarial diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg/day in three divided doses<ref name="Yong"/> for 21 days<ref name="WHO"/> remains the main therapeutic agent, and is generally well tolerated. Reported side effects include headache, fever, pruritus and gastrointestinal upset.<ref name="McLaugh">{{cite pmid|12812348}}</ref>  The eosinophil count often falls dramatically within 7–10 days of starting treatment.<ref name="Yong"/><ref name="Ong"/>
