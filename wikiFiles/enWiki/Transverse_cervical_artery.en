The '''transverse cervical artery''' ('''transverse artery of neck''' or '''transversa colli artery''') is an artery in the neck and a branch of the [[thyrocervical trunk]], running at a higher level than the [[suprascapular artery]].

==Path==
It passes transversely above the inferior belly of the [[omohyoid muscle]] to the anterior margin of the [[trapezius]], beneath which it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. 

It crosses in front of the phrenic nerve and the [[scalene muscles]], and in front of or between the divisions of the [[brachial plexus]], and is covered by the [[platysma]] and [[sternocleidomastoid]] muscles, and crossed by the [[omohyoid]] and [[trapezius]].

==Branches==
The transverse cervical artery splits into two branches, a superficial one and a deep one:
* [[Superficial branch of transverse cervical artery|Superficial branch]] (also known as the ''superficial cervical artery'')
* Deep branch (also called the [[dorsal scapular artery]]). ''Descending branch'' in older literature. Most often, however, this artery branches directly from the [[subclavian artery]].
