The '''medial circumflex femoral artery''' ('''internal circumflex artery''', '''medial femoral circumflex artery''') is an [[artery]] in the upper thigh that helps supply blood to the [[neck of the femur]]. Damage to the artery following a femoral neck fracture may lead to avascular (ischemic) necrosis of the femoral neck/head.<ref>{{cite pmid|3715086}}</ref>

==Structure==
The medial femoral circumflex artery arises from the medial and posterior aspect of the [[profunda femoris]] artery, and winds around the medial side of the [[femur]], passing first between the [[pectineus]] and [[iliopsoas]] muscles, and then between the [[obturator externus]] and the [[adductor brevis]] muscles. 

The medial femoral circumflex artery may occasionally arise directly from the [[femoral artery]].

===Branches===

At the upper border of the [[adductor brevis]] it gives off two branches: 

* The ''[[Ascending branch of medial circumflex femoral artery|ascending branch]]'' 

* The ''descending branch'' descends beneath the [[adductor brevis]], to supply it and the [[adductor magnus]]; the continuation of the vessel passes backward and divides into superficial, deep, and acetabular branches. 
** The ''[[Superficial branch of medial circumflex femoral artery|superficial branch]]'' 
** The ''[[Deep branch of medial circumflex femoral artery|deep branch]]'' 
** The ''[[Acetabular branch of medial circumflex femoral artery|acetabular branch]]''
