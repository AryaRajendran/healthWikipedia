Dr '''François Carlo Antommarchi''' (born 5 July 1780 in [[Morsiglia]], Corsica&nbsp;– d. 1838 in [[Santiago de Cuba]], Cuba) was [[Napoleon]]'s physician from 1818 to his death in 1821.

He began his studies in [[Livorno]], Italy, and later earned the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine at the [[University of Pisa]] in March 1808. Antommarchi then went to [[Florence]], Italy, and was attached to the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]].<ref group="nb">[[Leonardo da Vinci]] studied anatomy at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/itinerary/MedicineTuscany.html]</ref> Antommarchi earned the diploma of [[Surgeon]] in 1812 from the [[University of Florence]] (i.e. Imperial University) and was appointed by its president as [[Prosector]]. While in this capacity, Antommarchi worked under [[Paolo Mascagni]] (1752–1815)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/hardin/rbr/imaging/mascagni/about.htm |title="Paolo Mascagni", The University of Iowa, 12&nbsp;June 2006 |publisher=Lib.uiowa.edu |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> starting on 7 July 1813.

Antommarchi left [[Florence]] for [[Saint Helena]] to become [[Napoleon I]]'s physician until his death. Antommarchi took up this position at the behest of Napoleon's mother Maria [[Letizia Ramolino]] and his uncle Cardinal [[Joseph Fesch]].<ref name="sdc">Thomason, Henry D., "Napoleon, the First Emperor of France: From St. Helena to Santiago de Cuba. Being a Summary of Facts Concerning the Latter Days of Dr. François Antomarchi, the Last Physician to His Imperial Majesty", 1910 [http://books.google.com/books?id=vPflpJRs08kC&printsec=titlepage]</ref> Antommarchi received a letter of employment on 19 December 1818. Antommarchi was sent to St. Helena in replacement of Dr [[Barry Edward O'Meara]] as Napoleon's personal physician, because the illustrious captive would not agree to accept medical officers such as Dr Alexander Baxter or Dr James Roch Verling, who were proposed to him by his custodian, or "gaoler", sir [[Hudson Lowe]].
However, Napoleon was not so impressed by Antommarchi's medical skills and even dismissed him from his service a couple of times, only to let him resume his duty soonafter. In the last moments of illness, Antommarchi was assisted by Dr Archibald Arnott, who was accepted by Napoleon at the pressing demands from his two officers, Count Montholon and Grand-Marshal Bertrand.<ref>see [http://www.inside-longwood.com/inside-longwood-chronology-1821.html Chronology of Napoleon's last months of illness]</ref>
After Napoleon's death, Antommarchi wrote [[The Last Moments of Napoleon]] where he concluded that Napoleon died of [[stomach cancer]].

In 1831 Antommarchi went to Poland and became the general inspector of Polish hospitals during [[November Uprising]]<ref>Sven Jonas Stille, Podróż do Polski, Warszawa 1985, p. 137.</ref> where he assisted the Polish people in an uprising against the Russians. He fled to Paris to escape the czar's forces.

Antommarchi then immigrated to [[Louisiana]] where he donated the bronze death mask of Napoleon to the people of [[New Orleans]] in 1834. Antommarchi lived in [[Veracruz]], Mexico, for a brief period, and was employed there as an [[itinerant]] physician. He moved from [[Mexico]] and settled in [[Santiago de Cuba]], Cuba, where he again worked as a physician. The move to Cuba was prompted by Antommarchi seeking his cousin Antonio Juan Benjamin Antommarchi,<ref>Saby, Claude-Alain, "1815 Les naufragés de l'Empire aux Amériques", 2007 [http://books.google.com/books?id=NCzim531ddcC&printsec=frontcover]</ref> who made his fortune in coffee plantations. Antommarchi became adept at performing surgery for the removal of [[cataracts]]. He died in Cuba, of [[yellow fever]], on 3 April 1838, at the age of 57.<ref name="hub">{{cite web|url=http://www.acquirecontent.com/titles/medicinehealthand-bioethicsessential-primary-sources |title=Reynolds, James, "Head and Upper Body", 2006 |publisher=Acquirecontent.com |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref>

===Diary of Napoleon's Medical Care===
Antommarchi's diary contained detail records of his medical care for Napoleon. This diary is a source for numerous books published between 1823 and 1826.

===Anatomical Prints of the Human Body with Natural Dimensions, Paris, 1823===
[[Paolo Mascagni]] (1752–1815) was the most celebrated anatomist of his day. Antommarchi became [[Prosector]] to Mascagni who left manuscripts and drawings for an intended publication of a comprehensive complete anatomy with life-size figures. Antommarchi prepared the publication but was meanwhile called to Saint Helena. Antommarchi left, taking with him three copies of Mascagni's plates. When Antommarchi returned, he published these plates, printed from lithographs, under his own name in a monumental work which appeared from 1823 to 1826 under the title of: "Planches anatomiques du corps humain exécutées d'après les dimensions naturelles accompagnées d'un texte explicatif".<ref>Antommarchi, Francesco C., "Anatomical Prints of the Human Body with Natural Dimensions", 1826 [http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=01898x02&do=chapitre]</ref><ref>Antommarchi, Francisco, "Prodromo della grande anatomia seconda opera pstuma di Paolo Mascagni, posta in ordine, e poblicata a spese di una Societa innominata da Francisco Antommarchi", 1819</ref><ref>Antommarchi, Francisco, "Tavole figurate di aalcume porti organiche del corpo umano degli animali e dei vegetablii, esposte nel prodromo della grande anatomia di Paolo Mascagni", 1819</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cLcRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=Mascagni+Florence+anatomy+1815&source=bl&ots=guv1zAWFHJ&sig=KwdJ096E2598jHeXXrMEinYMMCc&hl=en&ei=OqEQSrv9O9eLtgfckdibCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA175,M1 |title=Moodie, Roy L., "Anatomical Names with Biographical Sketches", 1917 |publisher=Google Books |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> The plates for the publication were drawn and possibly engraved by [[Antoine Seratoni]].

==Name variants==
François Carlo Antommarchi's original name has many variants in the literature due to translations and misspellings:

*François Carlo Antommarchi (original name)
*François Charles Antommarchi (French translation)
*Francesco Carlo Antonmarchi (Italian translation)
*Francisco Carlos Antommarchi (Spanish translation)
*Francis Charles Antommarchi (English translation)
*Francesco Carlo Antomarchi (misspelling)

The phonetic pronunciation of "François" is "frahn-swah".<ref>"English Pronunciation Guide to the Names of People, Places, and Stuff", inogolo [http://inogolo.com/audio/Francois_4311.mp3]</ref>

==Controversy==

===Birth===
The literature cites both 1780<ref name="sdc"/> and 1789<ref>Gourdol, Jean-Yves, "Francesco Antommarchi 1789 – 1838. Physician Napoleon in Saint Helena", [http://www.medarus.org/Medecins/MedecinsTextes/antommarchi.html]</ref> as the birth date of Antommarchi.

===Napoleon's Death Mask===
It is unclear if the original cast for the Death Mask of Napoleon made by Antommarchi survived. It is said that Antommarchi's cast failed but Dr Francis Burton apparently took another cast which survived. To complicate matters, Madame Bertrand, apparently related to [[Henri Gatien Bertrand]] and Napoleon's attendant, is said to have stolen a large part of the cast taken by Burton and given it to Antommarchi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/top/deathmask.html |title="Napolean's death mask", National Museums Liverpool |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |accessdate=10 October 2010}} and {{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9404E5DD133FE233A25756C1A96E9C946496D6CF |title="Mystery of Napoleons Death Mask", The New York Times, 15&nbsp;April 1915 |work=New York Times |date=15 August 1915 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref>

No unequivocal and decisive proof has ever been presented to settle this controversy and it may never be resolved. Possible motivations for this controversy, for both parties, can include but are not limited to:
* Fierce rivalry between the conquerors, i.e. the British, and the conquered, i.e. the French
* Profiteering
* Fameseeking

===Right Hand Cast of Napoleon===
Despite a post-mortem cast of Bonaparte's right hand, allegedly by Antommarchi, sold<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designtoscano.com/product/code/NG32863.do |title="Historical: Hand of Napoleon Bonaparte", Designs Toscano |publisher=Designtoscano.com |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> and exhibited in museums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleonprisonnier.com/postmortem/reliquaires.html#inv |title="Napoleon, Prisoner&nbsp;— Post-mortem: The reliquaries", 2006 |publisher=Napoleonprisonnier.com |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref><ref>"The [[Arcole]] Napoleonic Museum", [http://www.histoire-empire.org/articles/musees/arcole/le_musee_napoleon_d_arcole_2.htm]</ref> none of the persons that were present in Saint Helena when Napoleon died ever reported that such a cast occurred. On the contrary, his servant Louis-Étienne Saint-Denis (a.k.a. "le mameluck Ali") regrets in his memoirs that nobody had the idea to cast Napoleon's hands.<ref>
