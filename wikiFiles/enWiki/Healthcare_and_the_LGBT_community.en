'''LGBT topics in medicine''' are those that relate to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people's health issues and access to health services.  According to the [[United States|US]] [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] (GLMA), besides [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], issues related to LGBT health include [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[cervical cancer]], [[hepatitis]], [[mental health]], [[substance abuse]], [[smoking|tobacco use]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], access to care for transgender persons, issues surrounding [[Same-sex marriage|marriage]] and family recognition, [[conversion therapy]], and refusal clause legislation, and laws that are intended to "immunize health care professionals from liability for discriminating against persons of whom they disapprove."<ref name="About GLMA">{{cite web |title=About GLMA|url=http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageId=532|publisher=Gay and Lesbian Medical Association|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>

Studies show that LGBT people experience health issues and barriers related to their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] or expression. Many avoid or delay care or receive inappropriate or inferior care because of perceived or real homophobia or transphobia, and discrimination by health care providers and institutions.,<ref name="Guidelines">{{cite web |title=GUIDELINES FOR CARE OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER PATIENTS|url=http://ce54.citysoft.com/_data/n_0001/resources/live/GLMA%20guidelines%202006%20FINAL.pdf|publisher=Gay and Lesbian Medical Association|accessdate=2008-12-28}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> in other words reason is negative personal experience, the assumption or expectation of negative experience based on knowing of history of such experience in other LGBT people, or both.<ref name="books.google.com">[http://books.google.com/books?id=VA2roY9wVq0C&pg=PA145&dq=Heterosexism+in+Health+and+Social+Care&ei=SF1fSq6DDJbyzQSX4JnBBQ&hl=bg Handbook of health behavior research, David S. Gochman, p.145]</ref>

It is often pointed that the reason of this is [[heterosexism]] in medical care and research:<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VA2roY9wVq0C&pg=PA145&dq=Heterosexism+in+Health+and+Social+Care&ei=SF1fSq6DDJbyzQSX4JnBBQ&hl=bg  Handbook of health behavior research, David S. Gochman, chapter 7, Health behaviour in lesbians, (Homophobia and heterosexism in healthcare system), pp. 145-147]</ref><ref>[Heterosexism in Health and Social Care, Julie Fish, 2006]</ref>

<blockquote>"Heterosexism can be purposeful (decreased funding or support of research projects that focus on sexual orientation) or unconscious (demographic questions on intake forms that ask the respondent to rate herself or himself as married, divorced, or single). These forms of discrimination limit medical research and negatively impact the health care of LGB individuals. This disparity is particularly extreme for lesbian women (compared to homosexual men) because they have a double minority status, and experience oppression for being both female and homosexual."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lesbian perinatal depression and the heterosexism that affects knowledge about this minority population|authors=S. Trettin, E. L. Moses-Kolko, and K. L. Wisner|url=http://www.paperinatal.org/app/webroot/files/Document52.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>

Especially with lesbian patients they may be discriminated in three ways:

# ''[[homophobia|homophobic]]'' attitudes
# ''[[heterosexism|heterosexist]]'' judgements and behaviour
# ''general [[sexism]]'' - with focusing primarily male health concerns and services; assigning subordinate to that of men health roles for women, as for service providers and service recipients <ref name="books.google.com"/>

==Issues affecting LGBT people generally==
Research from the UK indicates that there appears to be limited evidence available from which to draw general conclusions about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender health because epidemiological studies have not incorporated sexuality as a factor in data collection.<ref name = WMID/>  Review of research that has been undertaken suggests that there are no differences in terms of major health problems between LGBT people and the general population, although LGBT people generally appear to enjoy poorer health, with no information on common and major diseases, cancers or long-term health.<ref name = WMID/> mental health appears worse amongst LGBT people than the general population, with depression, anxiety and suicide ideation being 2-3 times higher than the general population.<ref name = WMID/><ref name = UCL>{{Cite journal | last1= King | first1= M

==Issues affecting bisexual people==
Typically, bisexual individuals and their health and well-being are not studied independently of lesbian and gay individuals. Thus, there is limited research on the health issues that affect bisexual individuals. However, the research that has been done has found striking disparities between bisexuals and heterosexuals, and even between bisexuals and homosexuals.

It is important to consider that the majority of bisexual individuals are well-adjusted and healthy, despite having higher instances of health issues than the heterosexual population.<ref>Russell, S. T., and Joyner, K. (2001). Adolescent sexual orientation and suicide risk: Evidence from a national study. American Journal of Public Health, 91, 1276-1281.</ref>

===Body Image/Eating Disorders===
Youth who reported having sex with both males and females are at the greatest risk for disordered eating, unhealthy weight control practices compared to youth who only have same- or other-gender sex.<ref>Robin, L., Brener, N. D., Donahue, S.F., Hack, T., Hale, K., and Goodenow, C. (2002).

S. 2006">Koh, A. S., and Ross, L. K. (2006). Mental health issues: A comparison of lesbian, bisexual and heterosexual women. Journal of Homosexuality, 51, 33-57.</ref>

===Mental Health and Suicide===
Bisexual females are higher on suicidal intent, mental health difficulties and mental health treatment than bisexual males.<ref>Mathy, R., Lehmann, B., & Kerr, D. (2003). Bisexual and Transgender Identities in a Nonclinical Sample of North americans: Suicidal Intent, Behavioral Diffulties, and Mental Health Treatment. Journal of Bisexuality, 3, 93-110.</ref> Bisexual women are twice as likely as heterosexual women to report suicidal ideation if they have disclosed their sexual orientation to a majority of individuals in their lives; those who are not disclosed are three times more likely.<ref name="Koh, A. S. 2006"/> Bisexual individuals have a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts than heterosexual individuals, and more self-injurious behavior than gay men and lesbians.<ref>Balsam, K.

Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 114, 471-476.</ref>

===Substance abuse===
Female adolescents who report relationships with same- and other-sex partners have higher rates of alcohol abuse, substance abuse.<ref>Udry, J. R., & Chantala K. (2002).Risk assessment of adolescents with same-sex relationships. Journal of Adolescent Health, 31, 84-92.</ref> This includes higher rates of marijuana and other illicit drug use.<ref>Eisenberg, M.

===Cancer===
Bisexual women are more likely to be [[nulliparous]], overweight and obese, have higher smoking rates and alcohol drinking than heterosexual women, all risk factors for breast cancer.<ref>Case, P., Bryn, A. S., Hunter, D. J., Manson, J. E., Malspeis, S., Willett, W. C., & Spiegelman, D. (2004). Sexual Orientation, Health Risk Factors, and Physical Functioning in the Nurses' Health Study II.

Human papillomavirus, smoking, and sexual practices in the etiology of anal cancer. Cancer, 101, 270-80</ref>

===HIV/AIDS and Sexual Health===
Most research on HIV/AIDS focuses on gay and bisexual men than lesbian and bisexual women. Evidence for risky sexual behavior in bisexually behaving men has been conflicted. Bisexually active men have been shown to be just as likely as gay or heterosexual men to use condoms.<ref>Jeffries, W. L. and Dodge, B. (2007). Male bisexuality and condom use at last sexual encounter: Results from a national Survey. Journal of Sex Research, 44, 78-289.</ref> Men who have sex with men and women are less likely than homosexually behaving men to be HIV-positive or engage in unprotected receptive anal sex, but more likely than heterosexually behaving men to be HIV-positive.<ref>Zule, W.

In a 2011 nationwide study in the United States, 46.1% of bisexual women reported having experienced rape, compred to 13.1% of lesbian women and 17.4% of heterosexual women<ref>{{cite web|url=<ref>{{cite web{{!}}url=http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_SOfindings.pdf}}</ref>}}</ref> , a risk factor for HIV.

==Issues affecting transgender people==

===Access to health care===

Transgender individuals are often reluctant to seek medical care or are denied access by providers due to [[transphobia]]/[[homophobia]] or a lack of knowledge or experience with transgender health.  Additionally, in some jurisdictions health care related to transgender issues especially [[sex reassignment therapy]] is not covered by medical insurance.<ref name="10 trans">{{cite web |title=TEN THINGS Transgender persons SHOULD DISCUSS WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS|url=http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageID=692|publisher=Gay and Lesbian Medical Association|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> However the Principle 17 of [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] affirm that "States shall (g) facilitate access by those seeking body modifications related to gender reassignment to competent, non-discriminatory treatment, care and support.<ref>The Yogyakarta Principles, Principle 17. The Rights to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health</ref>

Forty states do not fund sex reassignment surgery through Medicaid.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Liza|title=Transgender Health at the Crossroads: Legal Norms, Insurance Markets, and the Threat of Healthcare Reform|journal=Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law, and Ethics|year=2013|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=yjhple&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fas_ylo%3D2013%26q%3Dtransgender%2Bhealth%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5#search=%22transgender%20health%22}}</ref> 

In the National Transgender Discrimination Survey 19% said they had been refused healthcare by a doctor or other provider for being transgender. Trans people of color were more likely to have been refused healthcare. 36% of American Indian and 27% of multi-racial respondents had been refused healthcare compared to 17% of white respondents.

19% of respondents had no health insurance compared to 15% of the general population. They were also less likely to be insured by an employer. Undocumented non-citizens had particularly high rates of non-coverage (36%) as well as African-Americans (31%), compared to white respondents (17%).

28% said they had been verbally harassed in a healthcare setting. 2% of respondents reported being physically attacked in a doctor's office. Transgender people particularly vulnerable to being assaulted in a doctor's office were African-Americans (6%), those who engaged in sex work, drug sales or other underground work (6%), those who transitioned before they were 18 (5%), and those who were undocumented non-citizens (4%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2fwww.thetaskforce.org/downloads/resources_and_tools/ntds_report_on_health.pdf}}</ref>

===Cancer===
Cancers related to hormone use include breast cancer and liver cancer.  In addition, [[transman|transmen]] who have not had removal of the uterus, ovaries, or breasts remain at risk to develop cancer of these organs, while trans women remain at risk for [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="10 trans"/>

===Mental health===
According to Rebecca A. Allison, trans people are "particularly prone" to depression and anxiety: "In addition to loss of family and friends, they face job stress and the risk of unemployment.  Trans people who have not transitioned and remain in their birth gender are very prone to depression and anxiety.  Suicide is a risk, both prior to transition and afterward.  One of the most important aspects of the transgender therapy relationship is management of depression and/or anxiety."<ref name="10 trans"/>
Depression is significantly correlated with experienced discrimination.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Perceived discrimination and depression among low-income Latina male-to-female transgender women|year=2012|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/663}}</ref> In a study of San Francisco trans women, 62% reported depression.<ref>{{cite book|title=Women and HIV Prevention in Canada: Implications For Research, Policy and Practise|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Xj3wMM55Pb8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA157&dq=trans+women&ots=0q_giJN0VO&sig=jl-tEGx_BUjALZwpZ4HozMwxbYw#v=onepage&q=trans%20women&f=false}}</ref>

41% of the respondents of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey reported having attempted suicide. This statistic was even higher for certain demographics - for example, 56% of American Indian transgender respondents had attempted suicide. In contrast, 1.6% of the American population has attempted suicide.<ref name="thetaskforce.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf}}</ref> In the sample all minority ethnic groups (Asian, Latin@, black, American Indian and mixed race) had higher prevalence of suicide attempts than white people. Number of suicide attempts was correlated with life challenges - 64% of those surveyed who had been sexually assaulted had attempted suicide. For example, 76% who had been assaulted by teachers or other school staff had made an attempt.

In 2012 the Scottish Transgender Alliance conducted the Trans Mental Health Study, 74% of the respondents who had transitioned reported improved mental health after transitioning. 53% had self-harmed at some point, and 11% currently self-harmed. 84% of the sample had experienced [[suicide ideation]] and 48% had made a suicide attempt. 3% had attempted suicide more than 10 times. 63% of respondents who transitioned thought about and attempted suicide less after transitioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf}}</ref>

===Hormones===
Transgender individuals frequently take [[hormone]]s to achieve feminizing or masculinizing effects.  Side effects of hormone use include increased risk of [[blood clot]]ting, [[high blood pressure|high]] or [[low blood pressure]], elevated [[blood sugar]], water retention, [[dehydration]], electrolyte disturbances, liver damage, increased risk for [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].<ref name="10 trans"/>

===Injectable silicone===
Some trans people use injectable [[silicone]], sometimes administered by lay persons, to achieve their desired physique.  Such silicone may migrate, causing disfigurement years later.  Non-medical grade silicone may contain contaminants, and may be injected using a shared needle.<ref name="10 trans"/>

===Sexually transmitted infections===
Trans people (especially trans women - trans men have actually been found to have a lower rate of HIV than the general US population<ref name="endtransdiscrimination.org">{{cite web|url=http://endtransdiscrimination.org/PDFs/NTDS_Report.pdf}}</ref> ) are frequently forced into [[sex work]] to make a living, and are subsequently at increased risk for STIs including HIV. According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 2.64% of American transgender people are HIV positive, and transgender sex workers are over 37 times more likely than members of the general American population to be HIV positive. HIV is also more common in trans people of color, which is likely to be because trans people of color are more likely to be sex workers.<ref name="thetaskforce.org"/> For example, in a study by the National Institute of Health more than 56% of African-American trans women were HIV-positive compared to 27% of trans women in general.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/571708}}</ref> 

A 2012 meta analysis of studies assessing rates of HIV infection among transgender women in 15 countries found that trans women are 49 times more likely to have HIV than the general population.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2812%2970326-2/fulltext?_eventId=login}}</ref> HIV positive trans persons are likely to be unaware of their status. In one study, 73% of HIV-positive trans women were unaware of their status.<ref>{{cite journal|title=HIV Prevalence and Associated Risk Behaviors in New York City’s House Ball Community|year=2008|month=June|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2377289/}}</ref>

Latin American trans women have a HIV prevalence of 35%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsalliance.org/publicationsdetails.aspx?id=90623&dm_t=0,0,0,0,0}}</ref> but most Latin American countries don't recognize transgender people as a population. Therefore there are no laws catering to their health needs.

Transgender people have higher levels of interaction with the police that the general population. 7% of transgender Americans have been held in prison cell simply due to their gender identity/expression. This rate is 41% for transgender African-Americans.<ref name="endtransdiscrimination.org"/>  16% of respondents had been sexually assaulted in prison, a risk factor for HIV. 20% of trans women are sexually assaulted in prison, compared to 6% of trans men. Trans women of color are more likely to be assault whilst in prison. 38% of black trans women report having been sexually assaulted in prison compared to 12% of white trans women.

In a San Francisco study, 68% of trans women and 55% of trans men reported having been raped, a risk factor for HIV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationallgbtcancernetwork.com/media/pdf/1_in_4_trans_turned_away.pdf}}</ref>

===Substance abuse===
Like gay and bisexual men and women, trans people are more likely than the general population to use substances.  For example, studies have shown that trans men are 50% more likely, and trans women 200% more likely to smoke cigarettes than other populations.<ref name="Guidelines"/> In one study of trangender people, the majority had a history of non-injection drug use with the rates being 90% for [[marijuana]], 66% for [[cocaine]], 24% for [[heroin]], and 48% for crack.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transgender Health And HIV Prevention: Needs Assessment Studies from Transgender Communities Across the United States|page=6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7h25AjMBL0cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=health+transgender&hl=en&sa=X&ei=akZ-UeDBLPHB0gX23IC4CQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}</ref>

==Issues affecting lesbians==

===Breast cancer===

According to Katherine A. O’Hanlan, lesbians "have the richest concentration of risk factors for breast cancer [of any] subset of women in the world." Additionally, many lesbians do not get routine [[mammogram]]s, do [[breast self-exam]]s, or have clinical breast exams.<ref name=

===Depression and anxiety===
As with gay men, depression and anxiety are thought to affect lesbians at a higher rate than in the general population, for similar reasons.<ref name="10 women">{{cite web |title=TEN THINGS Lesbians SHOULD DISCUSS WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS|url=http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageID=691|publisher=Gay and Lesbian Medical Association|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>

===Domestic violence===
[[Domestic violence]] is reported to occur in about 11 percent of lesbian homes.  While this rate is about half the rate of 20 percent reported by heterosexual women, lesbians often have fewer resources available for shelter and counselling.<ref name="10 women"/>

===Physical fitness===
Research shows that on average lesbians have a higher [[body mass index]] than heterosexual women.<ref name="10 women"/>

===Substance abuse===
As with gay men, lesbians often have high rates of substance use, including recreational drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Studies have shown that lesbian and bisexual women are 200% more likely to smoke tobacco than other women.<ref name="Guidelines"/>

==Issues affecting gay men==

===Anal papilloma===

[[Human papilloma virus]], which causes anal and genital warts, plays a role in the increased rates of [[anal cancer]]s in gay men, and some health professionals now recommend routine screening with anal [[pap smear]]s to detect early cancers.<ref name="10 men">{{cite web |title=TEN THINGS GAY MEN SHOULD DISCUSS WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS|url=http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageID=690|publisher=Gay and Lesbian Medical Association|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>

===Depression and anxiety===
Studies by Cochran et al. (2003) and Mills et al. (2004), among others, suggest that depression and anxiety appear to affect gay men at a higher rate than in the general population.<ref name="10 men"/><ref name="Depression">{{cite web |title=Depression in the Gay Community|url=http://www.gay.com/news/roundups/package.html?sernum=1355&navpath=/channels/health/special/|publisher=Gay.com News|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>

According to GLMA, "the problem may be more severe for those men who remain in the closet or who do not have adequate social supports. [[Adolescent]]s and young adults may be at particularly high risk of [[suicide]] because of these concerns. Culturally sensitive mental health services targeted specifically at gay men may be more effective in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of these conditions."<ref name="10 men"/> Researchers at the [[University of California]] at San Francisco found that major risk factors for depression in gay and bisexual men included a recent experience of [[anti-gay violence]] or threats, not identifying as gay, or feeling alienated from the gay community.<ref name="Depression"/>

===Diet and fitness===
Gay men are more likely than straight men to suffer from [[eating disorder]]s such as [[bulimia]] or [[anorexia nervosa]], while [[obesity]] affects other gay men.<ref name="10 men"/>

===Hepatitis===
[[Men who have sex with men]] are at an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted infection]] with hepatitis, and immunization for [[Hepatitis A]] and [[Hepatitis B]] is recommended for all men who have sex with men. Safer sex is currently the only means of prevention for the [[Hepatitis C]].<ref name="10 men"/>

===Sexually transmitted infections===

===Substance abuse===
Studies have shown that gay men use substances, including [[recreational drug]]s such as [[poppers]] and [[marijuana]]; [[alcohol]]; and [[tobacco]] at a higher rate than the general population. Dr. [[David McDowell]] of [[Columbia University]], who has studied substance abuse in gay men, wrote that [[club drugs]] are particularly popular at [[gay bars]] and [[circuit parties]].<ref name=McD>[http://books.google.com/books?id=F7pPHTYQcyoC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=David+McDowell+MDMA&source=bl&ots=ZH20-n9Lb5&sig=sav0Rm_O3aqANcv-kLcaghc4Dnc&hl=en&ei=6ReoSYK5HYjTnQfa5-j4Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result#PPA38,M1 Addictions in the Gay and Lesbian Community], Jeffrey R.

==Issues affecting intersex people==
{{main|Intersex}}
Including [[intersex]] under LGBT can be controversial, with some intersex people identifying with LGBT and some not; some argue I{{Who|date=November 2010}} should be included as LGBTI.  Intersex people may identify as heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or no such labels, and so experience some of the issues related to these groups; however, intersex people can also have a variety of health issues from birth onwards that are unique to intersex people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  There are a range of ways people can be intersex, so between different types of intersex people there can be different health issues that relate to their situation.  For more information, see the article on intersex.

==Health of LGBT people of color==
In a review of research, Balmsam, Molina, et al, found that “LGBT issues were addressed in 3,777 articles dedicated to public health; of these, 85% omitted information on race/ethnicity of 9 participants”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/ace-women-health/3/ACEWH_rethinking_LGBTQ_health.pdf}}</ref> However, studies that have noted race have found significant health disparities between white LGBT people and LGBT people of color.
