'''Vis medicatrix naturae''' (also known as ''natura medica'') is the [[Latin]] translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]], νονσων φνσεις ιητροι, a phrase attributed to [[Hippocrates]] but which he did not actually use.<ref>Hiroshi, H. (1998) "On Vis medicatrix naturae and Hippocratic Idea of Physis"  Memoirs of School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Kanazawa University 22:45-54 http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/199907/000019990799A0162403.php</ref>  The phrase sums up one of the guiding principles of Hippocratic medicine which is that [[organism]]s contain “healing powers of nature”.

==Hippocrates==
Hippocrates believed that an organism is not passive to [[injuries]] or [[disease]], but rebalances itself to counteract them. The state of [[illness]], therefore, is not a malady but an effort of the body to overcome a disturbed equilibrium. It is this capacity of organisms to correct imbalances that distinguishes them from non-living matter.<ref>Grube, C. M. A (1954) “Greek medicine and the Greek genius” Phonix 8 123-135 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1086122 JSTOR]</ref> 

From this follows the medical approach that “nature is the best physician” or “nature is the healer of disease”. To do this Hippocrates considered a doctor’s chief aim was to help this natural tendency of the body by observing its action, removing obstacles to its action, and thus allow an organism to recover its own health.<ref name="Neuburger">Neuburger, M. (1944) "An Historical Survey of the Concept of Nature from a Medical Viewpoint" Isis 35 (1): 16–28 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/330687 JSTOR]</ref> This underlies such Hippocratic practices as [[blood letting]] in which a perceived excess of a [[humor]] is removed, and thus was taken to help the rebalancing of the body's [[Humorism|humors]].<ref>Neuberger, M. (1932) 'The doctrine of the healing power of nature throughout the course of time'. Homeopathy College New York. {{OCLC|10366814}}</ref>

==Renaissance and modern history==
After Hippocrates, the idea of vis medicatrix naturae continued to play a key role in medicine. In the [[early Renaissance]], the physician and early scientist [[Paracelsus]] had the idea of “inherent balsam”. [[Thomas Sydenham]], in the 18th century considered fever as a healing force of nature.<ref name="Neuburger"/>  
 
In the nineteenth-century, vis medicatrix naturae came to be interpreted as [[vitalism]], and in this form it came to underlie the philosophical framework of [[homeopathy]], [[chiropractic]], [[hydropathy]], [[osteopathy]] and [[naturopathy]].<ref name="Bynum"/> As Bynum notes, "Search the Internet for vis medicatrix naturae and you will find yourself in the land of what we now politely call 'alternative' or 'complementary' medicine".<ref name="Bynum">{{Cite PMID|11689921}}</ref>

==Relation to homeostasis==
[[Walter Cannon]]'s notion of [[homeostasis]] also has its origins in vis medicatrix naturae. "All that I have done thus far in reviewing the various protective and stabilizing devices of the body is to present a modern interpretation of the natural vis medicatrix.".<ref name="Cross">Cross, S. T. Albury, W. R. (1987) "Walter B. Cannon, L. J. Henderson, and the Organic Analogy"  Osiris  3:165-192 page 175 [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/368665]</ref> In this, Cannon stands in contrast to [[Claude Bernard]] (the father of modern [[physiology]]), and his earlier idea of [[milieu interieur]] that he proposed to replace vitalistic ideas about the body.<ref name="Cross"/> However, both the notions of homeostasis and milieu interieur are ones concerned with how the body's physiology regulates itself through multiple mechanical equilibrium adjustment feedbacks rather than nonmechanistic [[Vitalism|life forces]].

==Relation to Evolutionary medicine==
More recently, [[evolutionary medicine]] has identified many medical symptoms such as [[fever]], [[inflammation]], [[sickness behavior]], and [[morning sickness]] as evolved adaptations that function as ''darwinian medicatrix naturae'' due to their selection as means to protect, heal, or restore the injured, infected or physiologically disrupted body.<ref>Nesse, R. M. Williams, G. C. (1994) 'Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine' Vintage Books New York ISBN 0-679-74674-9</ref>
