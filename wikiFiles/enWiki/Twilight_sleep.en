==History==

Developed in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[Germany]], twilight sleep replaced [[chloroform]], the previous treatment for childbirth pains popular during the 1800s.<ref name=wondertime>{{cite news |first=Tina

Though introduced to the rest of the medical community in 1907, as of 1915, The Canadian Medical Association Journal reported that "the method [was] really still in a state of development", noting of many substitutions that different doctors had used in the place of morphine or scopolamine.<ref name=canadian/> 

In 1915, the [[New York Times]] published an article on twilight sleep and the work of Hanna Rion, or Mrs. [[Frank Ver Beck]], who had recently written a book entitled ''The Truth About Twilight Sleep''. In that article, Rion said that the consensus of 69 medical reports she had looked at said that "scopolamin-morphin is without danger to the child."<ref name=nyt_invest/>

This consensus would eventually change as the negative [[adverse effect|side effect]]s of twilight sleep came to light.

Initially heralded as the dawning of "a new era for woman and through her for the whole human race,"<ref name=nyt_invest/> the Freiburg method was eventually abandoned due to negative side effects.

Some of these complications were emotional, i.e. that it removed the [[mother]] from the experience of childbirth, leaving her with no memory of the [[Childbirth#First_stage:_contractions|labor]] or [[Childbirth#Second_stage:_delivery|delivery]] of the child. As one [[Nebraska]]n woman stated of the experience of twilight sleep, 
{{cquote|The next thing I knew I was awake [...] and then I thought to myself "I wonder how long before I shall begin to have the baby," and while I was still wondering a nurse came in with a pillow, and on the pillow was a baby, and they said I had had it—perhaps I had—but I certainly can never prove it in a courtroom.<ref name=nyt_invest/>}}

Moreover, the drugs had depressive effects on the [[central nervous system]] of the infant.<ref name=medterms.com/> This resulted in a drowsy newborn with poor breathing capacity.<ref name=medterms.com/><ref name=nyt_invest/>
