==Criticism==
The registry became the target of criticism when it was discovered that the UMass lab was billing the insurance of potential donors as much as $4336 per [[Bone_marrow_transplantation#Allogeneic|screening]].<ref>http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/articles/2010/12/23/marrow_donors_angry_over_charitys_high_bills/</ref><ref>http://www.telegram.com/article/20101226/NEWS/12260429/1116</ref> (Most labs charge about $100 for similar screening.<ref>http://www.aolnews.com/2010/12/17/report-marrow-registry-spent-thousands-on-sexy-recruiters</ref>) CRIR has also been criticized for spending up to $60,000 a week to hire models with blue wigs and high heels to lure donors<ref>http://www.aolnews.com/2010/12/17/report-marrow-registry-spent-thousands-on-sexy-recruiters/</ref> and for paying its top executive, Joanne Raymond, over $200,000 in annual salary and benefits.<ref>http://gamma.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Registry+executive+made+more+than+$200k&articleId=5cd5fb99-ddda-497e-998a-802f07d5c9bc</ref> The registry reported revenues of over $5 million during the same period.<ref>http://gamma.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Registry+executive+made+more+than+$200k&articleId=5cd5fb99-ddda-497e-998a-802f07d5c9bc</ref> CRIR and UMass are currently under investigation by the attorneys general of [[New Hampshire Attorney General|New Hampshire]] and [[Massachusetts Attorney General|Massachusetts]].<ref>http://gamma.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Registry+executive+made+more+than+$200k&articleId=5cd5fb99-ddda-497e-998a-802f07d5c9bc</ref>

New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have laws requiring insurers to pay for bone marrow screening.<ref>http://www.npr.org/2010/12/17/132121651/mass-n-h-take-aim-at-bone-marrow-registry</ref>
