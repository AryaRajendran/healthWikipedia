'''Elizabeth Hughes Gossett''' (August 19, 1907 - April 21, 1981) the daughter of U.S. Politician [[Charles Evans Hughes]], was one of the first patients treated with [[insulin]]. She received over 42,000 insulin shots before she died in 1981.<ref name=miracle>{{cite news |author=Abigail Zuger  |coauthors= |title=Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05insulin.html?_r=1&hp=&pagewanted=all |quote=But not Elizabeth Hughes: she ran in the other direction, far from the headlines that briefly made her the most famous diabetic child in the United States. Although she received an estimated 42,000 insulin shots before she died in 1981 at the age of 74, she systematically destroyed most of the material documenting her illness, expunged all references to diabetes from her fatherâ€™s papers, and occasionally even denied she had been ill as a child. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-06 }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Hughes was born August 19, 1907 in the [[New York State Executive Mansion]] in [[Albany, New York]], to Antoinette Carter and [[Charles Evans Hughes]], who was Governor of New York at the time of her birth.

Elizabeth developed [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|diabetes]] in 1919 at age 11. She was treated initially by Dr. [[Frederick M. Allen]] at his special clinic, the Physiatric Institute in [[Morristown, New Jersey]]. Dr. Allen put Elizabeth on a strict diet and continued to monitor her condition over the next three years while she lived at home with a private nurse. The diet was typically as low as 400 calories per day, and was restricted to a point below which sugar was detected in the urine. It caused a gradual weight loss from 75 pounds to a mere 45 pounds from 1919 to 1922 when insulin became available.

By the winter of 1921/22 her health was deteriorating seriously; she was 14 years old and weighed 52 pounds.<ref name=Davidson>[http://books.google.com/books?id=CRA5N-felmMC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=elizabeth+gossett+diabetes&source=bl&ots=Gp4cE4iscI&sig=RiKURztYPvsB-FWM2J8Eukagtj0&hl=en&ei=yAzNStTpA5TUsQPv7Oi_Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8#v=onepage&q=elizabeth%20gossett%20diabetes&f=false Clinical diabetes mellitus: a problem-oriented approach]</ref> In 1922 her mother contacted Canadian doctor [[Frederick Banting]] in Toronto. Elizabeth came to [[Toronto]] with her mother in August 1922 and began receiving [[insulin]] from Dr. Banting.<ref name=Insulin>[http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=HRE2005064S02098 Resurrections in Toronto: The Emergence of Insulin]</ref>
