}}'''Bernardino Ramazzini''' (1633 – 1714) was an [[Italy|Italian]] physician.(Italian pronunciation: ['bernardino ramat'tsini])

Ramazzini was an early proponent of the use of [[cinchona]] bark (from which [[quinine]] is derived) in the treatment of [[Malaria]].  His most important contribution to medicine was his book on occupational diseases, ''De Morbis Artificum Diatriba'' ("Diseases of Workers").

==Life==
Ramazzini was born in [[Carpi (MO)|Carpi]] on 3 November 1633. He studied medicine at the [[University of Parma]], where his interest in occupational diseases began. 

==Career==
He was appointed to the chair of theory of medicine at [[University of Modena]] in 1682 then served as professor of medicine at the [[University of Padua]] from 1700 until his death. He is often called "the father of [[occupational medicine]]" <ref name="chron" /><ref name="quotes" />

The first edition of ''De Morbis'' was published in 1700 in Modena, the second in 1713 in Padua.

===Occupational medicine===
His book on occupational diseases, ''De Morbis Artificum Diatriba'' (''Diseases of Workers'') outlined the health hazards of chemicals, dust, metals, repetitive or violent motions, odd postures, and other disease-causative agents encountered by workers in 52 occupations.<ref>{{cite book | last=Cockayne | first=Emily | title=Hubbub: Filth Noise & Stench in England | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-300-13756-9 | page=61}}</ref>  This was one of the founding and seminal works of [[occupational medicine]] and played a substantial role in its development.<ref name="chron">{{Cite journal

}} The article contains excerpts from the English translation by Wilmer Cave Wright (Chicago: University of Chicago Press; 1940) based on the Latin text of 1713, and includes a biographical note, ''Bernardino Ramazzini: The Father of Occupational Medicine'', by Giuliano Franco, MD and Francesca Franco MD, MPH</ref>

He proposed that physicians should extend the list of questions that [[Hippocrates]] recommended they ask their patients by adding, "What is your occupation?".<ref name="chron" />

===Malaria===
In regards to [[malaria]], Ramazzini was one of the first to support the use of the quinine-rich bark [[cinchona]].  Many falsely claimed that quinine was toxic and ineffective, but Ramazzini recognized its importance.  He is quoted, "It [quinine] did for medicine what gun powder did for war."<ref>{{cite book |title= An illustrated history of malaria|last= Poser|first= Charles M|authorlink= |coauthors= Bruyn, GW|year= 1999|publisher= Parthenon Publishing|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 978-1-85070-068-5|oclc= 40354694 }}</ref>

===Cancer===
In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini said that nuns developed [[breast cancer]] at a higher rate than married women because they did not engage in [[sexual intercourse]], and the "unnatural" lack of sexual activity caused instability of the breast tissues that sometimes developed into breast cancer.<ref name="isbn0-8018-6936-6">{{cite book
