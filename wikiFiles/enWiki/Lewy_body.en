'''Lewy bodies''' are abnormal aggregates of [[protein]] that develop inside [[nerve cell]]s in [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD), [[Dementia with Lewy bodies|Lewy body dementia]] and some other disorders. They are identified under the [[microscope]] when [[histology]] is performed on the [[brain]]. 

Lewy bodies appear as spherical masses that displace other cell components. The two morphological types are classical (brain stem) Lewy bodies and cortical Lewy bodies.  A classical Lewy body is an [[eosinophilic]] [[cytoplasm]]ic inclusion consisting of a dense core surrounded by a halo of 10-nm-wide radiating fibrils, the primary structural component of which is [[alpha-synuclein]].  In contrast, a cortical Lewy body is less well defined and lacks the halo.  Nonetheless, it is still made up of alpha-synuclein fibrils. Cortical Lewy bodies are a distinguishing feature of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but may occasionally be seen in ballooned neurons characteristic of [[Pick's disease]] and [[corticobasal degeneration]],<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Neural Transmission.

Lewy bodies were discovered by [[Frederic Lewy]] in 1912.

==Lewy neurites==
Similar to Lewy bodies, '''Lewy neurites''' are [[proteinaceous]] formations found in [[neurones]] of the diseased brain, comprising abnormal [[alpha-synuclein|α-synuclein]] filaments and granular material. They are a feature of α-synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA), and are found in the CA2-3 region of the [[hippocampus]] in [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|year=2004|title=Pathological entity of dementia with Lewy bodies and its differentiation from Alzheimer's disease|pmid=15235805|author=Wami Marui, Eizo Iskei, Masanori Kato, Hiroyasu Akatsu, Kenji Kosaka|volume=108|issue=2|pages=121–8|doi=10.1007/s00401-004-0869-4}}</ref>

[[Kelsey Grammer]]'s lead character, [[mayor of Chicago]] Tom Kane in the television series ''[[Boss (TV series)|Boss]]'', suffers from early-stage dementia with Lewy bodies.
