The '''BMC-series of journals''' is a collection of 65 online research journals published by [[BioMed Central]].<ref name=bmc-series>{{cite web |url= http://www.biomedcentral.com/authors/bmcseries |title=The ''BMC''-series journals |publisher=BioMed Central |accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref> Like all BioMed Central journals, they have a policy of [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] to the research articles they publish. Between them, they cover all major subject areas within biology and medicine. Two of the journals, ''[[BMC Biology]]'' and ''[[BMC Medicine]]'', have a broad scope, and aim to publish particularly significant research. A third journal, ''BMC Research Notes'', publishes research from all areas of biology and medicine without making impact or interest criteria for publication, while ''BMC Proceedings'' publishes conference proceedings.  The other 61 journals specialise on a particular subject area.

==Impact factor==
Most BMC journals have an  [[impact factor]]. For the 42 journals with official 2011 impact factors, it ranged from 1.00 (''BMC Ophthalmology'') to 6.04 (''BMC Medicine''), with a mean of 2.62.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/faq?name=impactfactor|title=BMC journals impact factors|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> Several of the subject-specific BMC journals are among the top quarter of journals in their field with regard to their impact factors, including ''BMC Genomics'', ''BMC Bioinformatics'', ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'', and ''BMC Molecular Biology''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ucsd.edu/bml/2006/08/03/bmc-molecular-biology-impact-factor-in-the-top-25/|title=BMC Molecular Biology Impact Factor in the Top 25%|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>
