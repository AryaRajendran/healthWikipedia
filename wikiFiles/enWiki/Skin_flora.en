[[File:Skin Microbiome20169-300.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the human body and bacteria that predominate]]
The '''skin flora''', more properly referred to as the '''skin microbiome''' or '''skin microbiota''', are the [[microorganism]]s which reside on the skin. Most research has been upon those that reside upon the 2 square metres of [[human skin]]. Many of them are [[bacterium|bacteria]] of which there are around 1000 species upon human skin from 19  [[Phylum|phyla]].<ref name="Grice">Grice EA, Kong HH, Conlan S. (2009). Topographical and Temporal Diversity of the Human Skin Microbiome, Science, 324: 1190 - 1192. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1171700}} PMID 19478181</ref><ref name="Pappas">Pappas S. (2009). [http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/cgi/content/full/sciencenow;2009/528/1 Your Body Is a Wonderland ... of Bacteria]. ScienceNOW Daily News</ref> The total number of bacteria on an average human has been estimated at 10<sup>12</sup> (1,000,000,000,000).<ref>Todar K. [http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/normalflora_3.html Normal Bacterial Flora of Humans] Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology.</ref> Most are found in the superficial layers of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the upper parts of [[hair follicle]]s. 

Skin flora are usually non-pathogenic, and either [[commensalism|commensal]]s (are not harmful to their host) or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient [[pathogenic]] organisms from [[Infection#Colonization|colonizing]] the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's [[immune system]].<ref name="Cogen">Cogen AL, Nizet V, Gallo RL. (2008). Skin microbiota: a source of disease or defence? Br J Dermatol. 158(3):442-55. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08437.x}} PMID 18275522</ref> However, resident microbes can cause [[skin disease]]s and enter the [[blood system]] creating life-threatening diseases particularly in [[immunosuppressed]] people.<ref name="Cogen"/> Hygiene to control such flora is important in preventing the transmission of [[antibiotic resistant]] [[hospital-acquired infection]]s. 

A major nonhuman skin flora is ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'', a [[chytrid]] and non-hyphal zoosporic fungus that causes [[chytridiomycosis]], an infectious disease thought to be responsible for the [[decline in amphibian populations]].

==Species variety==
===Bacteria===
[[image:Staphylococcus epidermidis 01.png|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' one of roughly a thousand [[bacteria]] species present on human [[skin]]. Though usually not [[pathogenic]], it can cause [[skin infection]]s and even life threatening illnesses in those that are [[immunocompromised]].]]

The estimate of the number of species present on skin bacteria has been radically changed by the use of [[16S ribosomal RNA]] to identify bacterial species present on skin samples direct from their genetic material. Previously such identification had depended upon [[microbiological culture]] upon which many varieties of bacteria did not grow and so were hidden to science.<ref name="Grice"/> 

''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' were thought from cultural based research to be dominant. However [[16S ribosomal RNA]] research finds that while common, these species make up only 5% of skin bacteria.<ref name="Grice08">Grice EA, Kong HH, Renaud G, Young AC; NISC Comparative Sequencing Program, Bouffard GG, Blakesley RW, Wolfsberg TG, Turner ML, Segre JA. (2008). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2493393&blobtype=pdf A diversity profile of the human skin microbiota]. Genome Res. 18(7):1043-50. PMID 18502944</ref> However, skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for [[bacteria]]. Most come from four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%).
[[File:Skin Microbiome20161-300.jpg|thumb|ecology of the 20 sites on the skin studied in the Human Microbiome Project]]

There are three main ecological areas: sebaceous, moist, and dry. ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' and ''[[Staphylococci]]'' species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. In moist places on the body ''[[Corynebacteria]]'' together with ''[[Staphylococci]]'' dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]] are dominant. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry one. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside the nostril), and on the back.<ref name="Grice"/>

===Fungal===
A study of the area between toes in 100 young adults found 14 different genera of fungi. These include [[yeast]]s such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula|Rhodotorula rubra]]'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', [[dermatophytes]] (skin living fungi) such as ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'',  and ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' and [[nondermatophyte]] fungi (opportunistic fungi that can live in skin) such as ''[[Rhizopus stolonifer]]'', ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Scopulariopsis brevicaulis]]'', ''[[Curvularia]]'', ''[[Alternaria alternata]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Penicillium]]'' species.<ref>Oyeka CA, Ugwu LO. (2002). Fungal flora of human toe webs. Mycoses. 45(11-12):488-91. PMID 12472726</ref>

== Relationship to host ==

Skin microflora can be [[commensalism|commensal]]s, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[pathogen]]s. Often they can be all three depending upon the strength of the person's [[immune system]].<ref name="Cogen"/> Research upon the immune system in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] and [[lungs]] has shown that microflora aids immunity development: however such research has only started upon whether this is the case with the skin.<ref name="Cogen"/> ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is an example of a mutualistic bacterium that can turn into a pathogen and cause disease: if it gains entry into the blood system it can result in infections in bone, joint, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. It can also cause [[dermatitis]]. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances such as pseudomonic acid (that are exploited commercially such as [[Mupirocin]]). This works against  [[staphylococcal]] and [[streptococcal]] infections.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa also produces substances that inhibit the growth of [[fungus]] species such as ''[[Candida krusei]]'', ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Torulopsis glabrata]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.<ref>Kerr JR. (1994). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=263067&blobtype=pdf Suppression of fungal growth exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa]. J Clin Microbiol. 32(2):525-7. PMID 8150966</ref> It can also inhibit the growth of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.<ref>Krausse R, Piening K, Ullmann U. (2005). Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori. Lett Appl Microbiol. 40(1):81-6. PMID 15613007</ref> So important is its antimicrobial actions that it has been noted that "removing ''P. aeruginosa'' from the skin, through use of oral or topical antibiotics, may inversely allow for aberrant yeast colonization and infection."<ref name="Cogen"/>

Another aspect of bacteria is the generation of [[body odor]]. [[Sweat]] is odorless however several bacteria may consume it and create byproducts which may be considered putrid by man (as in contrast to flies, for example, that may find them attractive/appealing).
Several examples are:
* ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' in  adolescent and adult sebaceous glands can turn its [[amino acid]]s into [[propionic acid]].
* ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' creates body odor by breaking sweat into [[isovaleric acid]] (3-methyl butanoic acid).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, ''et al.'' |title=Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control |journal=Can. J. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=357â€“64 |year=2006 |pmid=16699586 |doi=10.1139/w05-130 |url=}}</ref>
* ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' creates strong foot odor.<ref>Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, Koike K, Okisaka K, Hagura T, Kamiya T, Tomita F. (2006). Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control. Can J Microbiol. 52(4):357-64. PMID 16699586</ref>

==Skin defenses==
===Antimicrobial peptides===

The skin creates [[antimicrobial peptides]] such as [[cathelicidin]]s  that control the proliferation of skin microbes. Cathelicidins not only reduce microbe numbers directly but also cause the secretion of [[cytokine]] release which induces [[inflammation]], [[angiogenesis]], and [[reepithelialization]]. Conditions such as [[atopic dermatitis]] have been linked to the suppression in cathelicidin production. In [[rosacea]] abnormal processing of cathelicidin cause inflammation. [[Psoriasis]] has been linked to self-DNA created from cathelicidin peptides that causes [[Autoimmunity|autoinflammation]]. A major factor controlling cathelicidin is [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]].<ref>Schauber J, Gallo RL. (2008). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2639779&blobtype=pdf Antimicrobial peptides and the skin immune defense system]. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 122(2):261-6. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jaci.2008.03.027}} PMID 18439663</ref>

===Acidity===
The superficial layers of the skin are naturally acidic ([[pH]] 4-4.5) due to lactic acid in [[sweat]] and produced by skin bacteria.<ref name="Lambers">Lambers H, Piessens S, Bloem A, Pronk H, Finkel P. (2006). Natural skin surface pH is on average below 5, which is beneficial for its resident flora. Int J Cosmet Sci. 28(5):359-70. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x}} PMID 18489300</ref> At this pH mutualistic flora such as ''[[Staphylococci]]'', ''[[Micrococci]]'', ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' grow but not transient bacteria such as [[Gram negative bacteria]] like ''[[Escherichia]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or [[Gram positive]] ones such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' or ''[[Candida albicans]]''.<ref name="Lambers"/> Another factor affecting the growth of pathological bacteria is that the antimicrobial substances secreted by the skin are enhanced in acidic conditions.<ref name="Lambers"/> In alkaline conditions, bacteria cease to be attached to the skin and are more readily shed. It has been observed that the skin also swells  under alkaline conditions and opens up allowing move to the surface.<ref name="Lambers"/>

===Immune system===

If activated, the [[immune system]] in the skin produces [[cell-mediated immunity]] against microbes such as [[dermatophyte]]s (skin fungi).<ref name="Dahl">Dahl MV. (1993).Suppression of immunity and inflammation by products produced by dermatophytes. J Am Acad Dermatol. 28(5 Pt 1):S19-S23. PMID 8496406</ref> One reaction is to increase [[stratum corneum]] turnover and so shed the fungus from the skin surface. Skin fungi such as ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' have evolved to create substances that limit the immune response to them.<ref name="Dahl"/> The shedding of skin is a general means to control the build up flora upon the skin surface.

==Clinical==
===Skin diseases===

Microorganisms play a role in noninfectious [[Bacterial skin disease|skin disease]]s such as [[atopic dermatitis]],<ref>Baker BS. (2006). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1809642&blobtype=pdf The role of microorganisms in atopic dermatitis]. Clin Exp Immunol. 144(1):1-9.

Acne vulgaris: an investigation into the number of anaerobic diphtheroids and members of the Micrococcaceae in normal and acne skin.Br J Dermatol. 96(6):623-6.

Annu Rev Microbiol. 42:441-64. {{DOI|10.1146/annurev.mi.42.100188.002301}} PMID 3144238</ref>

===Infected devices ===
Skin microbes are source of infected medical devices such as [[catheters]].<ref>MartÃ­n-RabadÃ¡n P, GijÃ³n P, AlcalÃ¡ L, RodrÃ­guez-CrÃ©ixems M, Alvarado N, Bouza E. (2008), Propionibacterium acnes is a common colonizer of intravascular catheters. J Infect. 56(4):257-60. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jinf.2008.01.012}} PMID 18336916</ref>

==Hygiene==
===Contagion===

Skin flora do not readily pass between people: 30 seconds of  moderate friction and dry hand contact results in a transfer of only  0.07% of natural hand flora from naked with a greater percentage from gloves.<ref>Lingaas E, Fagernes M. (2009).  Development of a method to measure bacterial transfer from hands. J Hosp Infect. 72(1):43-9. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jhin.2009.01.022}} PMID 19282052</ref>

===Removal===
The most effective (60 to 80% reduction) antimicrobial washing is with [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], and [[n-propanol]]. [[Viruses]] are most affected by high (95%) concentrations of ethanol, while bacteria are more affected by  n-propanol.<ref>Kampf G, Kramer A. (2004). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=523567&blobtype=pdf Epidemiologic background of hand hygiene and evaluation of the most important agents for scrubs and rubs]. Clin Microbiol Rev. 17(4):863-93, {{DOI|10.1128/CMR.17.4.863-893.2004}} PMID 15489352</ref>

Unmedicated soaps are not very effective as illustrated by the following data. Health care workers washed their hands once in nonmedicated liquid soap for 30 seconds. The students/technicians for 20 times.<ref>de Almeida e Borges LF, Silva BL, Gontijo Filho PP. (2007). Hand washing: changes in the skin flora. Am J Infect Control. 35(6):417-20. {{DOI|10.1016/j.ajic.2006.07.012}} PMID 17660014</ref>

An important use of [[hand washing]] is to prevent the [[Nosocomial_infection#Transmission|transmission]] of [[antibiotic resistant]] skin flora that cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]. While such flora have become antibiotic resistant due to antibiotics there is no evidence that recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms when used in hand washing.<ref name="Weber">{{cite journal |author=Weber DJ, Rutala WA |title=Use of germicides in the home and the healthcare setting: is there a relationship between germicide use and antibiotic resistance? |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1107â€“19 |year=2006 |pmid=17006819 |doi=10.1086/507964}}</ref>  However, many strains of organisms are resistant to some of the substances used in antibacterial soaps such as [[Triclosan]].<ref name="Weber"/> 

One survey of [[soap|bar soaps]] in dentist clinics found they all had their own flora and on average from two to five different genera of microorganisms with those used most more likely to have more species varieties.<ref>Hegde PP, Andrade AT, Bhat K. (2006). [http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2006;volume=17;issue=2;spage=70;epage=3;aulast=Hegde Microbial contamination of "in use" bar soap in dental clinics]. Indian J Dent Res. 17(2):70-3. PMID 17051871</ref> Another survey of bar soaps in public toilets found even more flora.<ref>Kabara JJ, Brady MB. (1984).  Contamination of bar soaps under "in-use" conditions. J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 5(4-5):1-14. PMID 6394740</ref> Another study found that very dry soaps are not infected while all are that rest in pools of water.<ref>Afolabi BA, Oduyebo OO, Ogunsola FT. (2007). Bacterial flora of commonly used soaps in three hospitals in Nigeria. East Afr Med J. 84(10):489-95. PMID18232270</ref>  However, research upon soap that was specially infected found that soap flora do not transmit to the hands.<ref>Heinze JE, Yackovich F. (1988).  Washing with contaminated bar soap is unlikely to transfer bacteria. Epidemiol Infect. 101(1):135-42. PMID 3402545</ref>

===Damaged skin===
Washing skin repeatedly can damage the protective external layer and cause transepidermal loss of water. This can be seen in roughness characterized by scaling and dryness, itchiness, [[dermatitis]] provoked by microorganisms and [[allergen]]s penetrating the corneal layer and redness. Wearing gloves can cause further problems since it produces a humid environment favoring the growth of microbes and also contains irritants such as [[latex]] and [[talcum powder]].<ref name="Larson">Larson EL, Hughes CA, Pyrek JD, Sparks SM, Cagatay EU, Bartkus JM. (1998).Changes in bacterial flora associated with skin damage on hands of health care personnel. Am J Infect Control. 26(5):513-21. PMID 9795681</ref> 

Hand washing can damage skin because the [[stratum corneum]] top layer of skin consists of 15 to 20 layers of [[keratin]] disks, [[corneocyte]]s, each of which is each surrounded by a thin film of skin [[lipid]]s which can be removed by [[alcohol]]s and [[detergent]]s.<ref>Kownatzki E. (2003). Hand hygiene and skin health. J Hosp Infect. 55(4):239-45. PMID 14629966</ref> 

Damaged skin defined  by extensive cracking of skin surface, widespread reddening or occasional bleeding has also been found to be more frequently colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus hominis]]'' and these were more likely to [[methicillin]] resistant.<ref name="Larson" /> Though not related to greater antibiotic resistance, damaged skin was also more like to be colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[gram-negative bacteria]], ''[[Enterococci]]'' and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''.<ref name="Larson"/>

==Comparison with other flora==
The skin flora is different from that of the gut which is  predominantly [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]].<ref>Eckburg PB, Bik EM, Bernstein CN, Purdom E, Dethlefsen L, Sargent M, Gill SR, Nelson KE, Relman DA. (2005). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1395357&blobtype=pdf Diversity of the human intestinal microbial flora]. Science. 308(5728):1635-8. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1110591}} PMID 15831718</ref> There is also low level of variation between people that is not found in gut studies.<ref name="Grice08"/> Both gut and skin flora however lack the diversity found in [[soil flora]].<ref name="Grice"/>
