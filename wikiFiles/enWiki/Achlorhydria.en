'''Achlorhydria''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|eɪ|k|l|ɔər|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|i|ə}}) or '''hypochlorhydria''' refers to states where the production of [[gastric acid]] in the [[stomach]] is absent or low, respectively. It is associated with various other medical problems.

==Signs and symptoms==
The decreased acid level itself can cause symptoms similar to [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], and impairs protein digestion by inhibiting the activation of the enzyme [[pepsin]], whose activation is dependent upon a low gastric pH.  Furthermore, low acid levels in the stomach are linked with [[Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome|bacterial overgrowth]] (as the stomach does not kill microbes normally present in food), which can manifest as [[diarrhea]] or [[malabsorption|decreased absorption]] of nutrients or vitamins. Risk of particular infections, such as ''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]'' (commonly from seafood) is increased. Even without bacterial overgrowth, low stomach acid can lead to nutritional deficiencies through malabsorption of basic electrolytes ([[magnesium]], [[zinc]], etc.) and vitamins (including [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin K]], and the [[B complex]] of vitamins). Such deficiencies may be involved in the development of a wide range of pathologies, from fairly benign neuromuscular issues to life-threatening diseases. A person with achlorhydria can suffer from stomach pains caused by the digestion of food that is not properly broken down by gastric acid.

==Causes==
* The slowing of the body's basal metabolic rate associated with [[hypothyroidism]]
*[[Autoimmune disorder]]s where there is [[antibody]] production against [[parietal cell]]s which normally produce gastric acid.
* The use of [[antacids]] or drugs that decrease gastric acid production (such as [[H2-receptor antagonist]]s) or transport (such as [[proton pump inhibitor]]s).
* A symptom of [[rare disease]]s such as [[mucolipidosis]] (type IV).
* A symptom of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection which neutralizes and decreases secretion of [[gastric acid]] to aid its survival in the stomach.<ref name="pmid9207257">{{cite journal |author=El-Omar EM |title=Helicobacter pylori infection and chronic gastric acid hyposecretion |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=15–24 |year=1997 |pmid=9207257 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(97)70075-1 |author-separator=, |author2=Oien K |author3=El-Nujumi A |display-authors=3 |last4=Gillen |first4=D |last5=Wirz |first5=A |last6=Dahill |first6=S |last7=Williams |first7=C |last8=Ardill |first8=JE |last9=McColl |first9=KE}}</ref>
* A symptom of [[pernicious anemia]], [[atrophic gastritis]] or of [[stomach cancer]].
* [[Radiation therapy]] involving the stomach.
* [[Gastric bypass]] procedures such a [[duodenal switch]] and RNY, where the largest acid producing parts of the stomach are either removed, or blinded.
* [[VIPoma]]s (vasoactive intestinal peptides) and [[somatostatinoma]]s are both islet cell tumors of the pancreas.
* [[Pellagra]], caused by niacin deficiency.

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced|diagnosis|date=February 2013}}
90% of all patients with achlorhydria have detectable antibodies against the [[H+/K+ ATP-ase]] proton pump.  The diagnosis is made if the gastric pH remains high (>4.0) despite maximum [[pentagastrin]] stimulation. High [[gastrin]] levels are often detected.

==Treatment==
Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause of symptoms. With ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' induced achlorhydria, antibiotic treatment is usually prescribed, though it may not always reverse the condition completely.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15153171}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Little is known on the prognosis of achlorhydria, although there have been reports of an increased risk of gastric cancer.<ref name="pmid3952447">{{cite journal |author=Svendsen JH, Dahl C, Svendsen LB, Christiansen PM |title=Gastric cancer risk in achlorhydric patients.

Furthermore, experiments with achlorhydric mice have shown that non-''Helicobacter'' bacteria can induce atrophic gastritis, which, in turn, can cause gastric carcinoma.<ref name="pmid17200707">{{cite journal |author=Fox JG, Wang TC |title=Inflammation, atrophy, and gastric cancer. |journal=J Clin Invest. |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=60–69 |year=2007|pmid=17200707 |doi=10.1172/JCI30111.}}</ref>
