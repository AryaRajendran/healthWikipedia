Degeneration of one or more [[intervertebral disc]](s) of the [[vertebral column|spine]], often called "'''degenerative disc disease'''" (DDD) or "'''degenerative disc disorder,'''" is a condition that can be painful and can greatly affect the quality of one's life. While disc degeneration is a normal part of aging and for most people is not a problem, for certain individuals a degenerated disc can cause severe chronic pain if left untreated.

==Symptoms==

With symptomatic degenerative disc disease, chronic low [[back pain]] sometimes radiates to the [[hip]]s, or there is [[pain]] in the [[buttocks]] or [[thigh]]s while walking; sporadic [[Paresthesia|tingling]] or [[Weakness (medical)|weakness]] through the knees may also be evident. Similar pain may be felt or may increase while sitting, bending, lifting, and twisting. Chronic neck pain can also come from the cervical spine, with pain radiating to the head, shoulders, arms and hands. [[Cervical Arterial Disease]] or CAD may cause interrupted blood supply to the brain resulting in headaches, vertigo, and the diminution of cognitive abilities and memory.

==Understanding disc pain==
After an injury, some discs become painful because of inflammation. Some people have nerve endings that penetrate more deeply into the [[annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|annulus fibrosus]] (outer layer of the disc) than others, making discs more susceptible to becoming a source of pain. The scientific community{{Who|date=March 2009}} has the opinion that the healing process involved in the repair of trauma to the outer annulus results in the [[innervation]] of the resultant scar tissue, and subsequent pain in the disc, as these nerves become inflamed by [[nucleus pulposus]] material.   Degenerative disc disease can lead to a chronic debilitating condition and can have a serious negative impact on a person's quality of life. When pain from degenerative disc disease is severe, traditional nonoperative treatment may be ineffective.

==Pathologic changes==
[[Image:Degenerative disc disease - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a fragment of a resected degenerative vertebral disc, showing degenerative [[fibrocartilage]] and clusters of chondrocytes. [[HPS stain]].]]
Degenerative discs typically show degenerative [[fibrocartilage]] and clusters of chondrocytes, suggestive of repair.  Inflammation may or may not be present. [[Histologic]] examination of disc fragments resected for presumed DDD is routine to exclude [[malignancy]].

Fibrocartilage replaces the gelatinous mucoid material of the nucleus pulposus as the disc changes with age. There may be splits in the annulus fibrosis, permitting herniation of elements of nucleus pulposus. There may also be shrinkage of the nucleus pulposus that produces prolapse or folding of the annulus with secondary osteophyte formation at the margins of the adjacent vertebral body. The pathologic findings in DDD include protrusion, [[spondylolysis]], and/or subluxation of vertebrae (sponylolisthesis) and [[spinal stenosis]].

==Treatment options==

Often, degenerative disc disease can be successfully treated without [[surgery]]. One or a combination of treatments such as [[physical therapy]], [[chiropractic manipulative therapy]] (CMT) and other [[chiropractic]] treatments, [[osteopathic manipulative medicine|osteopathic manipulation]], anti-inflammatory medications such as [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]], or [[spinal injections]] often provide adequate relief of troubling symptoms.

Surgery may be recommended if the conservative treatment options do not provide relief within two to three months. If leg or back pain limits normal activity, if there is weakness or numbness in the legs, if it is difficult to walk or stand, or if medication or physical therapy are ineffective, surgery may be necessary, most often [[spinal fusion]]. There are many surgical options for the treatment of degenerative disc disease.  The most common surgical treatments include:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spineuniverse.com/displayarticle.php/article4029.html | title = Degenerative Disc Disease - When Surgery Is Needed | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref>

* '''Anterior cervical [[discectomy]] and fusion:''' A procedure that reaches the cervical spine (neck) through a small incision in the front of the neck. The intervertebral disc is removed and replaced with a small plug of bone or other graft substitute, and in time, that will fuse the vertebrae.

* '''Cervical [[corpectomy]]:''' A procedure that removes a portion of the vertebra and adjacent intervertebral discs to allow for decompression of the cervical spinal cord and spinal nerves. A [[bone graft]], and in some cases a metal plate and screws, is used to stabilize the spine.

* '''Dynamic Stabilisation:''' Following a discectomy, a stabilisation implant is implanted with a 'dynamic' component. This can be with the use Pedicle screws (such as Dynesys or a flexible rod) or an interspinous spacer with bands (such as a Wallis ligament). These devices off load pressure from the disc by rerouting pressure through the posterior part of the spinal column. Like a fusion, these implants allow maintain mobility to the segent by allowing flexion and extension.

* '''[[Facetectomy]]:''' A procedure that removes a part of the [[zygapophysial joint|facet]] to increase the space.

* '''[[Foraminotomy]]:''' A procedure that enlarges the [[vertebral foramen]] to increase the size of the nerve pathway. This surgery can be done alone or with a laminotomy.

* '''[[Intervertebral disc annuloplasty|Intervertebral disc annuloplasty (IDET)]]:''' A procedure wherein the disc is heated to 90°C for 15 minutes in an effort to seal the disc and perhaps deaden nerves irritated by the degeneration.

* '''[[Intervertebral disc arthroplasty]]:''' also called Artificial Disc Replacement (ADR), or Total Disc Replacement (TDR), is a type of [[arthroplasty]]. It is a surgical procedure in which degenerated [[intervertebral disc]]s in the [[spinal column]] are replaced with artificial ones in the lumbar (lower) or cervical (upper) spine. 

* '''[[Laminoplasty]]:''' A procedure that reaches the cervical spine from the back of the neck. The spinal canal is then reconstructed to make more room for the spinal cord.

* '''[[Laminotomy]]:''' A procedure that removes only a small portion of the [[Lamina of the vertebral arch|lamina]] to relieve pressure on the nerve roots.

* '''Micro-discectomy:''' A procedure that removes a disc through a very small incision using a microscope.

* '''Percutaneous disc decompression:''' A procedure that reduces or eliminates a small portion of the bulging disc through a needle inserted into the disc, minimally invasive.

* '''[[Percutaneous Laser Disc-Decompression (PLDD)]]:''' Based on this small study population, it can be concluded that PLDD may be an effective treatment for disco-genic back pain with minimal natural recurrence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Black W, Fejos AS, Choy DS |title=Percutaneous laser disc decompression in the treatment of discogenic back pain |journal=Photomed Laser Surg |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=431–3 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15671718 |doi=10.1089/pho.2004.22.431 }}</ref>

* '''[[Spinal decompresson]]:''' A non-invasive procedure that enlarges the [[Intra Vertebral Foramen]] (IVF) by aiding in the rehydration of the spinal discs.

* '''Spinal [[laminectomy]]:''' A procedure for treating [[spinal stenosis]] by relieving pressure on the spinal cord. A part of the lamina is removed or trimmed to widen the spinal canal and create more space for the spinal nerves.

New treatments are emerging that are still in the beginning clinical trial phases. [[Glucosamine]] injections may offer pain relief for some without precluding the use of more aggressive treatment options. In the US artificial disc replacement is viewed cautiously as a possible alternative to fusion in carefully selected patients, yet it is widely used in a broader range of cases in Europe, where multi-level disc replacement of the cervical and lumbar spine is common. [[Adult stem cell]] therapies for disc regeneration are in their infancy.  Investigation into [[mesenchymal stem cell]] therapy knife-less fusion of vertebrae in the United States began in 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.biotechnews.com.au/index.php/id;140193681 | title = Mesoblast files spinal fusion IND | date = 2006-11-27 | accessdate = 2009-02-16 | publisher = Australian Life Scientist }}</ref>
