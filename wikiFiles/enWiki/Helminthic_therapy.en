'''Helminthic therapy''', a type of [[immunotherapy]], is the treatment of [[autoimmune disease]]s and [[immune disorder]]s by means of deliberate infestation with a [[helminth]] or with the ova of a helminth. Helminths are [[parasitic worm]]s such as [[hookworms]] and [[whipworms]].

Helminthic therapy consists of the [[inoculation]] of the patient with specific parasitic intestinal [[nematodes]] (helminths). There are currently three closely related treatments available.

Helminthic infection has emerged as one possible explanation for  the low incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies  in less developed countries, together with the significant and sustained increase in autoimmune diseases in industrialized countries.<ref name="pmid 16778161"/><ref name="pmid ">{{cite journal |author= P Zaccone, * Z Fehervari, * J M Phillips, D W Dunne, and A Cooke |title= Parasitic worms and inflammatory diseases |journal= Parasite Immunol |volume= 28 |issue= 10|pages=515–523 | year=2006|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-3024.2006.00879.x |pmid= 16965287 |pmc= 1618732}}</ref><ref name="pmid 12127652 ">{{cite journal |author= Pugliatti M, Sotgiu S and Rosati G. |title= The worldwide prevalence of multiple sclerosis |journal= Clin Neurol Neurosurg  | month= July |volume=104 |pages=182–191 |year=2002 |pmid= 12127652  |doi=10.1016/S0303-8467(02)00036-7 |url=http://whilesciencesleeps.com/references/pdf/344 | format=PDF | accessdate=4 March 2011 |issue= 3}}</ref><ref name="pmid14684567">{{cite journal |author=Weinstock JV, Summers R, Elliott DE. |title= Helminths and harmony |journal=Gut |volume=53 |issue= 1|pages=7–9 |year=2004 |pmid= 14684567 |pmc=1773927 |doi=10.1136/gut.53.1.7}}</ref>

== Incidence of autoimmune diseases and parasitic infestation ==

While it is recognized that there is probably a genetic disposition in certain individuals for the development of autoimmune diseases, the rate of increase in [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of autoimmune diseases is not a result of genetic changes in humans, the rise of autoimmune related diseases in the industrialised world occurring in too short a time to be explained in this way. There is evidence that one of the primary reasons for the increase in autoimmune diseases in the industrialized nations is the significant change in environmental factors over the last century. Environmental factors include exposure to certain artificial chemicals from industrial processes, medicines, farming and food preparation. It is posited that the absence of exposure to certain parasites, bacteria and viruses is playing a significant role in the development of autoimmune diseases in the more sanitized Western industrialized nations.<ref name="pmid15687885">{{cite journal |author= David E. Elliott; Robert W. Summers; Joel V. Weinstock. | title= Helminths and the Modulation of Mucosal Inflammation |journal= Current Opinion in Gastroenterology  |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=51–58 | year=2005 |pmid= 15687885|doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid17153852">{{cite journal |author= Mohan C. |title= Environment versus genetics in autoimmunity: a geneticist's perspective |journal= Lupus |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=791–793 |year=2006 |pmid=17153852 |doi=10.1177/0961203306070005}}</ref>

Lack of exposure to naturally occurring pathogens and parasites  may result in an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. This is consistent with the  [[hygiene hypothesis]].<ref name="pmid 16778161"/><ref name="pmid2513902">{{cite journal |author= Strachan D P. |title= Hay fever, hygiene, and household size |journal= BMJ. |volume=299 |issue=6710 |pages=1259–1260 |year=2006 |pmid=2513902 |doi=10.1136/bmj.299.6710.1259 |pmc= 1838109}}</ref>  A complete explanation of how environmental factors play a role in autoimmune diseases has still not been proposed. However epidemiological studies, such as the meta analysis by Leonardi-Bee et al.,<ref name="pmid 16778161"/> have helped to establish the link between parasitic infestation and its protective role in autoimmune disease development.

Genetic research on the [[interleukin]] genes (IL genes) shows that helminths have been a major selective force on a subset of these human genes.  In other words, helminths have shaped the evolution of at least parts of the human immune system, especially the genes responsible for [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[celiac disease]] — and provides further evidence that it is the absence of parasites, and in particular helminths, that has likely caused a substantial portion of the increase in incidence of diseases of immune dysregulation and inflammation in industrialized countries in the last century.<ref name="pmid19468064">{{cite journal |author=Fumagalli M, Pozzoli U, Cagliani R, ''et al.'' |title=Parasites represent a major selective force for interleukin genes and shape the genetic predisposition to autoimmune conditions |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=206 |issue=6 |pages=1395–408 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19468064 |doi=10.1084/jem.20082779 |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715056/|pmc=2715056}}</ref>

== Theoretical explanation ==

Although the mechanism of [[autoimmune disease]] development is not fully defined, there is broad agreement that the majority of autoimmune diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to innocuous [[antigens]], driven by a branch of the [[immune system]] known as the [[T helper cell|TH1 type immune response]]. Extra-cellular antigens primarily trigger the TH2 response, as observed with allergies, while intracellular antigens trigger a TH1 response. The relationship between these two types of immune response is a central theme of the [[hygiene hypothesis]], which suggests that there is a regulatory action between the two types of response. However, the observation that allergies and autoimmune response are increasing at a similar rate in the industrialized nations appears to undermine the hygiene hypothesis.

A refinement of the hygiene hypothesis, which overcomes this apparent contradiction, is the "old friends hypothesis."<ref name="pmid15577925">{{cite journal |author=Hadley C |title=Should auld acquaintance be forgot.. |journal=EMBO Rep. |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=1122–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15577925 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400308 |pmc=1299202}}</ref> The old friends hypothesis modifies the hygiene hypothesis by proposing that [[Regulatory T cell|T regulator cell]]s can only become fully effective if they are stimulated by exposure to microorganisms and parasites that have low levels of pathogenicity, and which have coexisted universally with human beings throughout our evolutionary history. This theory has recently been given more credibility by a study demonstrating the impact of infectious organisms, and helminths in particular, upon genes responsible for the production of various [[cytokine]]s, some involved in the regulation of inflammation, in particular those associated with the development of [[Crohn's Disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], and [[celiac disease]].<ref name="pmid19468064">{{cite journal

The hygiene hypothesis proposes that appropriate immune response is in part learned by exposure to these microorganisms and parasites, and in part regulated by their presence. In the industrialised nations, humans are exposed to somewhat lower levels of these organisms. The development of vaccines, hygienic practices, and effective medical care have diminished or eliminated the prevalence and impact of many parasitic organisms, as well as bacterial and viral infections. This has been of obvious benefit with the effective eradication of many diseases that have plagued human beings. However, while many severe diseases have been eradicated, humans' exposure to benign and apparently beneficial parasites has also been reduced commensurately. The central thrust of the theory is, therefore, that correct development of [[Regulatory T cell|T regulator cell]]s in individuals may depend on exposure to organisms such as lactobacilli, various mycobacteria, and helminths.<ref name="pmid14684567" /> Lack of exposure to sufficient benign antigens, particularly during childhood, is sometimes suggested as a cause of the increase in autoimmune diseases and diseases for which chronic inflammation is a major component in the industrialized world.
