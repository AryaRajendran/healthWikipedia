== Why physicians write ==
Physicians have a long history, dating back to [[Greece|Greek]] [[medicine]], of literary activities.  This may have its origins in [[mythology]].  [[Apollo]] was the god of both poetry and medicine.  [[Pallas Athene]] was the [[goddess]] of poetry, [[healing]] and war. [[Brigid#Divine responsibilities|Brigit]] was the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] patroness of poets, [[Smith (metalwork)|smiths]] and [[healers]].

It is thought that through their privileged and intimate contact with those moments of greatest human drama (birth, illness, injury, suffering, disease, death) physicians are in a unique position to observe, record and create the stories that make us human.  "The clinical gaze [has] much in common with the artist's eye." <ref>M. Faith McLellan, "Literature and Medicine: Physician-Writers," ''[[The Lancet]]'', volume 349, issue 9051, 22 February 1997, pp. 564-67.</ref>

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]], in his Preface to ''[[Underwoods]]'',<ref>Edinburgh edition, 1894; London, Charles Baxter & Sidney Colvin.</ref> described this unique privilege:
<blockquote>
There are men and classes of men that stand above the common herd: the soldier, the sailor, and the shepherd not infrequently; the artist rarely; rarelier still, the clergyman; the physician almost as a rule. He is the flower (such as it is) of our civilization; and when that stage of man is done with, and only to be marvelled at in history, he will be thought to have shared as little, as any in the defects of the period, and most notably exhibited the virtues of the race. Generosity he has, such as is possible to those who practise an art, never to those who drive a trade; discretion, tested by a hundred secrets; tact, tried in a thousand embarrassments; and what are more important, Heraclean cheerfulness and courage. So that he brings air and cheer into the sick room, and often enough, though not so often as he wishes, brings healing.
</blockquote>

The challenges of combining medical practice with writing are addressed by neurologist and pharmacologist [[Harold L. Klawans]] in his study, ''Chekhov's Lie''.<ref>[[Harold L. Klawans]], ''Chekhov's Lie'', 1997, ISBN 1-888799-12-9.</ref>

== Worldwide organizations ==
In 1955 a group of physician-writers created the International Federation of Societies of Physician-Writers ''(FISEM). '' One of the founders was Dr. André Soubiran, author of ''Hommes en blanc'' (The Doctors).  Other founders included Italian Professors Nasi and Lombroso,  Belgian Drs. Sévery and Thiriet, Swiss physicians Junod and René Kaech, and eminent French writers of the medical academy.  Dr. Mirko Skoficz was a key figure at the first FISEM congress in [[Sanremo|San Remo]], [[Italy]], along with his wife, [[Italy|Italian]] [[film star]] [[Gina Lollobrigida]].

In 1973 FISEM changed its name to UMEM—''Union Mondiale des Écrivains Médécins'', or ''World Union of Physician Writers''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Its current president is Dr. Carlos Vieira Reis of Portugal. UMEM is an umbrella organization that  subsumes physician-writer groups in:

== Anglophone associations ==
In the [[Anglosphere|Anglophone]] world, the lead has been taken by [[New York University]] (NYU) with their encyclopedic ''Literature, Arts & Medicine Database'' (http://litmed.med.nyu.edu) and [[blog]] (http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/blog/).  An associated resource is the ''Medical Humanities'' directory:  http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/directory.html.

These sites were established in 1994 at the [[New York University School of Medicine]] and were:

<blockquote>
“dedicated to providing a resource for scholars, educators, students, patients, and others who are interested in the work of medical humanities. We define the term ‘medical humanities’ broadly to include an interdisciplinary field of humanities (literature, philosophy, ethics, history and religion), social science (anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology), and the arts (literature, theater, film, and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice. The humanities and arts provide insight into the human condition, suffering, personhood, our responsibility to each other, and offer a historical perspective on medical practice. Attention to literature and the arts helps to develop and nurture skills of observation, analysis, empathy, and self-reflection -- skills that are essential for humane medical care. The social sciences help us to understand how bioscience and medicine take place within cultural and social contexts and how culture interacts with the individual experience of illness and the way medicine is practiced.”<ref>[http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/ Medical Humanities<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

Dr. Daniel Bryant, an American internist, has compiled an extensive list of fellow physician writers which can be assessed at http://library.med.nyu.edu/library/eresources/featuredcollections/bryant/roster.html

The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] publishes ''[[Literature and Medicine]]'',  “a journal devoted to exploring interfaces between literary and medical knowledge and understanding. Issues of illness, health, medical science, violence, and the body are examined through literary and cultural texts.” <ref>[http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/literature_and_medicine/ Johns Hopkins University Press | Journals | Literature and Medicine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The [[British Medical Association]] keeps an updated, though selective, list of Physician-Writers on its web site:  http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/LIBDoctorWriters
