[[Dark skin]] pigmentation was the original condition for the [[genus]] [[Homo]], including Homo sapiens. However, as populations migrated away from the [[tropics]] between 125,000 and 65,000 years ago<ref>Tim Appenzeller, Nature [http://www.nature.com/news/human-migrations-eastern-odyssey-1.10560 Human migrations: Eastern odyssey] 485, 24–26 doi:10.1038/485024a 02 May 2012</ref> into areas of low UV radiation, they developed light skin pigmentation as an [[evolutionary selection]] acted against [[vitamin D]] depletion.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=Relethford2000>{{cite journal |last1=Relethford |first1=JH |title=Human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations |journal=Human biology; an international record of research |issue=72 |volume=5 |pages=773–80 |year=2000 |pmid=11126724}}</ref>

Humans with light skin pigmentation have natural skin with low amounts of [[eumelanin]], and have fewer [[melanosome]]s than humans with dark skin pigmentation. Light skin provides better absorption qualities of ultraviolet radiation. This helps the body to synthesize higher amounts of [[vitamin D]] for bodily processes such as calcium development.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=pbs>{{cite web|last=Gina|first=Kirchweger|title=The Biology of Skin Color: Black and White|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/07/3/text_pop/l_073_04.html|work=Evolution Library|publisher=PBS|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

Light-skinned people who live near the equator with high sunlight are at an increased risk of [[folate]] depletion. As consequence of folate depletion, they are at a higher risk of [[DNA damage]], [[birth defect]]s, and numerous types of [[cancer]]s, especially [[skin cancer]].<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=linus>{{cite web|last=Jane|first=Higdon|title=Vitamin D|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/|work=Micronutrient Information Center|publisher=Linus Pauling Institute|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

The distribution of indigenous light-skinned populations is highly correlated with the low ultraviolet radiation levels of the regions inhabited by them. Light-skinned indigenous populations almost exclusively live far from the equator in high latitude areas with low sunlight intensity; for example, in [[Canada]], [[Mongolia]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Western Europe|Western]], and [[Eastern Europe]]. Due to mass migration and increased mobility of people between geographical regions in recent centuries, light-skinned populations today are found all over the world, even in tropical climates.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=oneil1>{{cite web|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|title=Skin Color Adaptation|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_4.htm|work=Human Biological Adaptability: Skin Color as an Adaptation|publisher=Palomar|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Modern human variation: overview|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_1.htm}}</ref>

==Evolution==

An abundance of clinical and epidemiological evidence supports that light skin pigmentation developed for the importance of maintaining [[vitamin D3]] production in the skin.<ref name=jabl04>{{cite journal|last=Nina|first=Jablonski|title=The evolution of human skin and skin color|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=33|pages=585–623}}</ref> [[Dark skin]] pigmentation was the original condition for the [[genus]] [[Homo]] and has been maintained for populations in areas of high UV radiation through [[Human evolution|human evolutionary history]]. As a consequence, there must have been a strong [[selective pressure]] for the evolution of light skin in areas of low UV radiation.<ref name="Relethford2000"/> The evidence that [[Dark skin#Evolution|dark skin evolved]] as a protection against the effect of [[UV radiation]] is overwhelming, and research shows that [[eumelanin]] protects against both [[Folate deficiency|folate depletion]] and direct [[DNA damage|damage to DNA]]. This accounts for the development of dark skin pigmentation of people living near the equator but does not account for the increasingly lighter-skinned people living outside the tropics.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=Viet>{{cite book|last=Vieth|first=R.|title=Effects of vitamin D on bone and natural selection of skin color: how much vitamin D nutrition are we talking about?|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press|location=New York|pages=135–150}}</ref><ref name=Hatc>{{cite journal|last=Hatchcock et al.|title=Risk assessment for vitamin D|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2007|volume=72|pages=451–462}}</ref><ref name=Kimb>{{cite journal|last=Kimball et al.|title=Vitamin D: a growing perspective|journal=Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences|year=2008|volume=45|pages=339–414}}</ref>

In the 1960s, biochemist W. Farnsworth Loomis suggested that skin colour is related to the body’s need for [[vitamin D]]. The overwhelming positive effect of UV radiation in land-living [[vertebrates]] is the ability to synthesize [[vitamin D3]] from it. A certain amount of vitamin D which penetrates the skin helps the body to absorb more [[calcium]] which is essential for building and maintaining bones, especially for developing [[embryo]]s. Vitamin D production depends on exposure to sunlight. People living in latitudes far from the equator developed light skin in order to help absorb more vitamin D. People with light ([[Fitzpatrick scale|type II]]) skin can produce previtamin D3 in their skin at rates 5-10 times faster than dark-skinned ([[Fitzpatrick scale|type V]]) people.<ref name=Clem87>{{cite journal|last=Clements et al.|title=Increased skin pigment reduces the capacity of skin to synthesize vitamin D|year=1987|volume=1|pages=74–76}}</ref><ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|coauthors=Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2000|volume=39|series=57-106}}</ref><ref name=webb06>{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=A.R.|title=Who, what, where, and when: influences on cutaneous vitamin D synthesis|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|volume=92|pages=17–25}}</ref><ref name=Arma>{{cite journal|last=Armas et al.|title=Ultraviolet-B radiation increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: The effect of UVB dose and skin color|journal=Journal of American Academy of Dermatology|year=2007|volume=57|pages=588–593}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=T.C.|coauthors=et al.|title=Factors that influence the cutaneous synthesis and dietary sources of vitamin D|journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics|year=2007|volume=460|pages=213–217}}</ref> People living far from the equator were under evolutionary pressure to develop light skin, which allowed more penetration of UV radiation and helped to produce more of the essential vitamin D.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

In 1978 NASA launched [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]]. In 1998 anthropologist Nina Jablonski and her husband George Chaplin collected spectrometer data to measure UV radiation levels around the world, and compared it to published information on the skin colour of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] populations of more 50 countries. The results showed a very high correlation between UV radiation and skin colour; the weaker the sunlight was in a geographic region, the lighter the indigenous people’s skin were. Jablonski went on to prove that people living above the latitudes of 50 degrees have the highest chance of developing vitamin D deficiency. "This was one of the last barriers in the history of human settlement," Jablonski states. "Only after humans learned fishing, and therefore had access to food rich in vitamin D, could they settle regions of [[high latitude]]."
People living far from the equator developed light skin to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D during winter with low levels of UV radiation. Genetic studies suggest that light-skinned humans have been selected for multiple times.<ref name=Lama>{{cite journal|last=Lamason et al.|title=SLC24A5, a putative caution exchanger, affects pigmentation in zebrafish and humans|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=310|pages=1782–1786}}</ref><ref name=Lalu>{{cite journal|last=Lalueza-Fox et al.|title=A melanocortin-1 receptor allele suggests varying pigmentation among Neanderthals|journal=Science|year=2007|volume=318|pages=1453–1455}}</ref><ref name="Norton07">{{cite journal|last=Norton et al.|title=Genetic evidence for the convergent evolution of light skin in Europeans and East Asians|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|year=2007|volume=24|issue=3|pages=710–722|pmid=17182896}}</ref>

Some populations who had diets rich in vitamin D were less affected by the evolutionary selection for light skin. Vitamin D3 is available in low quantities in fish and liver.<ref name=Bjor>{{cite journal|last=Bjorn et al|title=Vitamin D in an ecological context|journal=International Journal of Circumpolar Health|year=2000|volume=59|pages=26–32}}</ref><ref name=van_d>{{cite journal|last=Van deer Meer et al.|title=Fatty fish and supplement are the greatest modifiable contributors to the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in a multiethnic population|journal=Clinical Endocrinology|year=200/|volume=68|pages=466–472}}</ref> Populations who lived in coastal areas or areas with access to abundant sources to seafood could get their proportion of vitamin D from food. Some arctic populations, such as the [[Inuit]]s, could retain some of their skin pigmentation in areas of low UV radiation. In the summer they receive high levels of UV radiation as reflection from the snow, and their relatively darker skin protects them from the sunlight.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name="Relethford2000"/><ref name="pbs"/>

===Earlier hypotheses===

There were two other main hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the development of light skin pigmentation: resistance to cold injury, and occurrence of a mutation effect; now both of them are considered unlikely to be the main mechanism behind the evolution of light skin.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref> 

The resistance to cold injury hypothesis claimed that dark skin was selected against in cold climates far from the equator and in higher attitudes as dark skin was more affected by [[frostbite]].<ref name=Post>{{cite journal|last=Post et al.|title=Cold injury and the evolution of "white" skin|journal=Human biology|year=1975|volume=47|pages=65–80}}</ref> It has been found that reaction of the [[skin]] to extreme cold climates has actually more to do with other aspects, such as the distribution of [[connective tissue]] and distribution of [[fat]],<ref name=Stee>{{cite journal|last=Steegman|first=A.T. Jr|title=Frostbite of the human face as a selective force|journal=Human Biology|year=1967|volume=39|pages=131–144}}</ref><ref name=Kitt>{{cite journal|last=Kittles|first=R.|title=Nature, origin, and variation of human pigmentation|journal=Journal of Black Studies|year=1995|volume=26|pages=36–61}}</ref> and with the responsiveness of peripheral [[capillaries]] to differences in temperature, and not with pigmentation.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

The supposition that dark skin evolved in the absence of selective pressure was put forward by the ''probable mutation effect'' hypothesis.<ref name=Brac>{{cite journal|last=Brace|first=C.L.|title=Structural reduction in evolution|journal=American Naturalist|year=1963|volume=97|pages=39–49}}</ref> The main factor initiating the development of light skin was seen as a consequence of [[genetic mutation]] without an evolutionary [[selective pressure]]. The subsequent spread of light skin was thought to be caused by [[assortive mating]]<ref name="Kitt"/> and sexual selection contributed to an even lighter pigmentation in females.<ref name=Fros>{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=P.|title=Human skin color: a possible relationship between its sexual dimorphism and its social perception|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|year=1988|volume=32|pages=38–59}}</ref><ref name=Aoki>{{cite journal|last=Aoki|first=K.|title=Sexual selection as a cause of human skin colour variation: Darwin's hypothesis revisited|journal=Annals of Human Biology|year=2002|volume=29|pages=589–608}}</ref> Doubt has been cast on this hypothesis, as a more random patterns of skin coloration would be expected in contrast to the observed structural light skin pigmentation in areas of low UV radiation .<ref name="Norton07" /> The [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] (gradual) distribution of skin pigmentation observable in the Eastern hemisphere, and to a lesser extent in the Western hemisphere is one of the  most significant characteristic of human skin pigmentation. Increasingly lighter skinned populations are distributed across areas with incrementally lower levels of UV radiation.<ref name=Rele97>{{cite journal|last=Relethford|first=J.H.|title=Hemisphere difference in human skin color|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=1997|volume=104|pages=449–457}}</ref><ref name=Chap>{{cite journal|last=Chaplin|first=G.|coauthors=Jablonski|title=Hemisphere differences in human skin color|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=1998|volume=107|pages=221–224}}</ref>

==Biochemistry==
[[File:Lightly pigmented skin.jpg|500px|right|Darkly pigmented skin]]
[[Melanin]] is a derivative of the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]]. [[Eumelanin]] is the dominant form of melanin found in [[human skin]]. Eumelanin protects tissues and DNA from radiation damage by [[UV light]]. Melanin is produced in specialized cells called [[melanocyte]]s, which are found in the lowest level of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].<ref>Haas et al., 2005</ref> Melanin is produced inside small membrane-bound packages called [[melanosome]]s. Humans with naturally occurring light skin have varied amounts of smaller and scarcely distributed eumelanin and its lighter-coloured relative, [[pheomelanin]].<ref name="Lama"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Thong|first=H.Y.|coauthors=''et al''.|title=The patterns of melanosome distribution in keratinocytes of human skin as one determining factor of skin colour|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|year=2003|volume=149|pages=498–505}}</ref> The concentration of pheomelanin varies highly within populations from individual to individual, but it is more commonly found among East Asians, Native Americans, and Northern Europeans with red hair.<ref name="jabl04"/>

For the same body region, individuals, independently of skin colour, have the same amount of melanocytes (however variation between different body part is substantial), but organelles which contain pigments, called melanosomes, are smaller and less numerous in light-skinned humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Szabo|first=G|coauthors=''et al''.|title=Racial differences in the fate of melanosomes in human epidermis|journal=Nature|volume=222|pages=1081–1082}}</ref>

For people with very light skin, the skin gets most of its colour from the bluish-white connective tissue in the [[dermis]] and from the [[haemoglobin]] associated [[blood]] cells circulating in the [[capillaries]] of the dermis. The colour associated with the circulating haemoglobin become more obvious, especially in the face, when [[arteriole]]s dilate and become tumefied with blood as a result of prolonged [[physical exercise]] or stimulation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (usually [[embarrassment]] or [[anger]]).<ref name=Jabl06>{{cite book|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|title=Skin: a Natural History|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}</ref>

The characteristic of fair skin, [[red hair]], and [[freckling]] is associated with high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This [[phenotype]] is caused by a [[loss-of-function]] mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sturm|first=R.A.|coauthors=et al.|title=Genetic association and cellular function of MC1R variant alleles in human pigmentation|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2003|volume=994|pages=348–358}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=J.L.|title=Genetics of hair and skin color|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|year=2003|volume=37|pages=67–90}}</ref> However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where red hair and extremely fair skin is prevalent.<ref name="Norton07" /> The gene variation’s primary effect is to promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alaluf|first=S.|coauthors=et al.|title=Ethnic variation in melanin content and composition in photo exposed and photo protected human sjin|journal=Pigment Cell Research|year=2002|volume=15|pages=112–118}}</ref> Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with [[keratinocyte]]s give rise to a distribution pattern characteristic of light skin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Minwala|first=S|coauthors=''et al''.|title=Keratinocytes Play a Role in Regulating Distribution Patterns of Recipient Melanosomes In Vitro|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|year=2001|volume=117|pages=341–347}}</ref> Freckles usually only occur in people with very lightly pigmented skin.

People with moderately pigmented skin ([[Fitzpatrick scale|Types III-IV]]) are able to produce melanin in their skin in response to UVR. Normal [[tanning]] is usually delayed as it takes time for the melanins to move up in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. Heavy tanning does not approach the photoprotective effect against UVR-induced [[DNA damage]] compared to naturally occurring [[dark skin]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tadokoro|first=T|coauthors=''et al''.|title=Mechanisms of skin tanning in different racial/ethnic groups in response to ultraviolet radiation|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|year=2005|volume=124|pages=1326–1332}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=K.P.|coauthors=et al.|title=The importance of the depth distribution of melanin in skin for DNA protection and other photobiological processes|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|year=2006a|volume=82|pages=194–198}}</ref> however it offers great protection against seasonal variations in UVR. Gradually developed tan in the spring prevents sunburns in the summer. This mechanism is almost certainly the evolutionary reason behind the development of tanning behaviour.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

Variations in the ''KITL'' gene have been positively associated with about 20% of melanin concentration differences between African and non-African populations. One of the alleles of the gene has an 80% occurrence rate in Eurasian populations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Craig T. |last2=Beleza |first2=Sandra |last3=Pollen |first3=Alex A. |last4=Schluter |first4=Dolph |last5=Kittles |first5=Rick A. |last6=Shriver |first6=Mark D. |last7=Kingsley |first7=David M. |title=cis-Regulatory Changes in Kit Ligand Expression and Parallel Evolution of Pigmentation in Sticklebacks and Humans |journal=Cell |issue=131 |volume=6 |pages=1179–89 |year=2007 |pmid=18083106 |pmc=2900316 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.10.055}}</ref><ref>[http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-perl/snp_details_phase3?name=rs642742&source=hapmap3r3_B36&tmpl=snp_details_phase3 HapMap: SNP report for rs642742].

Whilst not all of these genes directly affect melanin production, most of them code for proteins that may play a significant role in melanogenesis and control melanin concentration. Some of these genes are found to be more prevalent in certain population than others.

==Health implications==

Skin pigmentation is an evolutionary adaptation to the various UV radiation levels around the world. There are health implications of light-skinned people living in environments of high UV radiation. Various cultural practices increase problems related to health conditions of light skin, for example [[sunbathing]] among the light-skinned.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref>

===Advantages of light skin pigmentation in low sunlight environments===

Humans with light skin pigmentation living in low sunlight environments experience increased [[vitamin D]] synthesis compared to humans with dark skin pigmentation due to the ability to absorb more sunlight. With the increase of vitamin D synthesis, there is a decreased incidence of conditions that are related to common vitamin D deficiency conditions of people with dark skin pigmentation living in environments of low UV radition: [[rickets]], [[osteoporosis]], numerous [[cancer]] types (including [[Colon cancer|colon]] and [[breast cancer]]), and immune system malfunctioning. Vitamin D promotes the production of [[cathelicidin]], which helps to defend humans' bodies against fungal, bacterial, and viral [[infection]]s, including [[flu]].<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=oneil1>{{cite web}}</ref>

===Disadvantages of light pigmentation in high sunlight environments===
[[File:Babygram.jpg|thumb|100px|Fatal neural tube defect]]
Light-skinned people living in high sunlight environments are more susceptible to the harmful UV rays of sunlight because of the lack of [[melanin]] produced in the skin. The most common risk that comes with high exposure to sunlight is the increased risk of [[sunburn]]s. This increased risk has come along with the cultural practice of sunbathing, which is popular among some human populations. This cultural practice to gain tanned skin if not regulated properly can lead to sunburn, especially among very lightly-skinned humans. The overexposure to sunlight also can lead to [[basal cell carcinoma]], which is a common form of [[skin cancer]].

Another health implication is the [[Folate deficiency|depletion of folate]] within the body, where the overexposure to UV light can lead to [[megaloblastic anemia]]. Folate deficiency in pregnant women can be detrimental to the health of their newborn babies in the form of [[neural tube defect]]s, [[miscarriage]]s, and [[spina bifida]], a birth defect in which the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] and [[spinal canal]] do not close before birth.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Djukic|first=A|title=Folate-resposive neurologic diseases|journal=Paediatric Neurology|year=2007|volume=37|pages=387–397}}</ref> The peak of neural tube defect occurrences is the highest in the May–June period in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book}}</ref> Folate is needed for [[DNA replication]] in dividing cells and deficiency can lead to failures of normal [[embryogenesis]] and [[spermatogenesis]].<ref name="jabl1">{{cite book}}</ref><ref name=oneil1>{{cite web}}</ref><ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|coauthors=Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2000|volume=39|pages=57–106}}</ref> 

Individuals with lightly pigmented skin who are repeatedly exposed to strong UV radiation, experience faster aging of the skin, which shows in increased wrinkling and anomalies of pigmentation. Oxidative damage causes the degradation of protective tissue in the [[dermis]], which confers the strength of the skin.<ref name="jabl04"/> It has been postulated that white [[women]] may develop [[wrinkle]]s faster after [[menopause]] than black women because they are more susceptible to the lifetime damage of the sun through life. Dr. Taylor, of Yale University School of Medicine, concluded that the study could not prove the findings but they suspect the underlying cause. Light-coloured skin has been suspected to be one of the contributing factors that promote wrinkling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Amy|first=Norton|title=White women's skin may show wrinkles sooner|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/10/us-skin-wrinkles-idUSTRE6A941S20101110|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gary|first=Cole|title=Wrinkles|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/wrinkles/article.htm|publisher=MedicineNet.com|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>

==Geographic Distribution==
[[File:Old Tatar Man - Kazan - Russia.JPG|thumb|300px|Light-skinned old man in [[Russia]]]]
[[File:Mongolian children with mother.jpg|thumb|left|Light-skinned [[Mongols|Mongolian]] children with mother]]
North or south of 46 degrees latitude - e.g. in [[Canada]], [[Mongolia]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Western Europe]] - dark-skinned people could not produce enough [[vitamin D]], and humans settlement only occurred after the development of light skin pigmentation<ref>{{cite web|title=Skin Color: Handy tool for teaching evolution|url=http://live.psu.edu/story/51438}}</ref> 

There is a correlation between the geographic distribution of UV radiation and the distribution of skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that are further away from the equator and are generally closer to the poles have lower concentration of UV radiation, thus they reflect lighter pigmentation. Although the present distribution of human skin colours does not reflect this correlation due to the [[mass migration]] and movement of peoples across continents in the past, there are still indigenous peoples living in ancestral environment. Areas like Scandinavia and Siberia have very low concentrations of UV rays, and indigenous populations are all light-skinned.<ref name="jabl1">{{cite book}}</ref><ref name="Jabl00"/>

==Culture==
{{Main|Colorism}}
The desirability of light skin has varied depending on country and time. Today, in some countries, very light skin is as seen as unattractive and unhealthy. At the same time, in some countries, very light skin is seen as more desirable among women.
