==History==
The journals were founded under the title ''Journal of Gerontology'' in 1946. In 1961, material dealing with social policy, program development, and service delivery was split into a new journal, ''[[The Gerontologist]]''. In 1988 ''Journal of Gerontology'' was renamed ''Journals of Gerontology'' to reflect the fact that it represented a composite of four journals with four separate editors, and in 1995 it was split into two separate publications: the ''Journals of Gerontology: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences'' and the ''Journals of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences''.<ref name=OUP>{{cite web| title=The Journal of Gerontology| url=http://geronj.oxfordjournals.org/| accessdate=2012-07-14| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>
