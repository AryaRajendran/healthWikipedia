'''Caplan's syndrome''' (or '''Caplan disease''' or '''Rheumatoid pneumoconiosis'''<ref name=Murray>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=John F.|title=Murray and Nadel's textbook of respiratory medicine.|year=2010|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-4710-0|page=1566|edition=5th ed.}}</ref>) is a combination of [[rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis (RA)]] and [[pneumoconiosis]] that manifests as intrapulmonary nodules, which appear homogenous and well-defined on [[chest X-ray]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ondrasík M |title=Caplan syndrome |journal=Baillieres Clin Rheumatol |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=205–10 |year=1989 |pmid=2661027 |doi=10.1016/S0950-3579(89)80045-7}}</ref> 

==Signs and symptoms==
Caplan syndrome presents with [[cough]] and [[shortness of breath]] in conjunction with features of rheumatoid arthritis such painful joints and morning stiffness.
Examination should reveal tender, swollen [[MCP joints]] and [[rheumatoid nodules]]; [[auscultation]] of the chest may reveal diffuse [[râles]] that do not disappear on coughing or taking a deep breath.

==Causes==
Caplan syndrome occurs only in patients with both RA and [[pneumoconiosis]] related to mining dust (coal, asbestos, silica).The condition occurs in miners (especially those working in [[anthracite]] coal-mines), [[asbestosis]], [[silicosis]] and other pneumoconioses. There is probably also a genetic predisposition, and [[smoking]] is thought to be an aggravating factor.

==Pathophysiology==
The presence of rheumatoid arthritis alters how a person's immune system responds to foreign materials, such as dust from a coal mine.<ref name=Murray />  When a person with rheumatoid arthritis is exposed to such offensive materials, they are at an increased risk of developing pneumoconiosis.<ref name=Murray />

==Diagnosis==
*[[Chest X-ray|Chest radiology]] shows multiple, round, well defined [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], usually 0.5-2.0&nbsp;cm in diameter, which may cavitate and resemble [[tuberculosis]].
*[[Lung function tests]] may reveal a mixed restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect with a loss of lung volume. There may also be irreversible airflow limitation and a reduced [[DLCO]].
*[[Rheumatoid factor]], [[antinuclear antibodies]], and non-organ specific antibodies may be present in the serum.
*[[Silicosis]] and [[asbestosis]] must be considered in the differential with TB.

==Management==
Once tuberculosis has been excluded, treatment is with [[steroids]]. All exposure to coal dust must be stopped, and [[smoking cessation]] should be attempted. Rheumatoid arthritis should be treated normally with early use of [[DMARDs]].

==Prognosis==
The nodules may pre-date the appearance of rheumatoid arthritis by several years. Otherwise prognosis is as for RA; lung disease may remit spontaneously, but pulmonary fibrosis may also progress.

==Epidemiology==
[[incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is currently 1 in 100,000 people but is likely to fall as the coal mining industry declines.It has also been shown to occur in case of complicated silicosis(marked by progressive massive pneumoconiosis).

==History==
The syndrome is named after Dr. Anthony Caplan, a physician on the [[Cardiff Pneumoconiosis Panel]], who identified the constellation of findings as a distinct entity in a 1953 publication.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0040-6376| volume = 8| issue = 1| pages = 29–37| last = Caplan| first = Anthony| title = Certain Unusual Radiological Appearances in the Chest of Coal-miners Suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis| journal = Thorax| year = 1953| doi = 10.1136/thx.8.1.29| pmid = 13038735| pmc = 1019224}}</ref> He followed this with further articles exploring the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0007-1447| volume = 2| issue = 4848| pages = 1231–1236| last = Miall| first = W.
