'''Hyperplasia''' (from [[ancient Greek]] ὑπέρ ''huper'', "over" + πλάσις ''plasis'', "formation") or '''hypergenesis''', means increase in number of cells/[[cell proliferation|proliferation of cells]]. It may result in the [[Gross anatomy|gross enlargement]] of an organ and the term is sometimes mixed with benign [[neoplasia]] / [[benign tumor]].

Hyperplasia is a common preneoplastic response to stimulus. Microscopically cells resemble normal cells but are increased in numbers. Sometimes cells may also be increased in size ([[hypertrophy]]).<ref name="McGavin">{{cite book |author=M. Donald McGavin, James F. Zachary |title=Pathologic Basis of Veterinary Disease, Fourth Edition |year=2007 |publisher=Mosby Elsevier}}</ref> Hyperplasia is different from [[hypertrophy]] in that the [[Cellular adaptation|adaptive cell change]] in hypertrophy is an increase in [[cell size|cell ''size'']], whereas hyperplasia involves an increase in the ''number'' of cells. [[Image:Hyperplasia vs Hypertrophy.svg|thumb|right|300px|Simple illustration to show the difference between '''hyperplasia''' and [[hypertrophy]].]]

==Difference from neoplasia==
Hyperplasia is considered to be a [[physiology|physiological]] (normal) response to a specific stimulus, and the cells of a hyperplastic growth remain subject to normal regulatory control mechanisms. This stands in contrast to [[neoplasia]] (the process underlying [[cancer]] and benign tumors), in which [[carcinogenesis|genetically abnormal cells]] [[cell proliferation|proliferate]] in a non-physiological manner which is unresponsive to normal stimuli.<ref name="robbins">{{cite book |author=Ramzi Cotran,  Sixth Edition |year=1999 |publisher=W.B. Saunders |isbn=0-7216-7335-X |oclc=222671811}}</ref>

As seen in examples below, such physiological proliferation of cells may in fact be [[comorbidity|secondarily]] due to a [[pathological]] cause. Still, the proliferation itself is a normal response to another abnormal condition, in contrast to neoplasia, where the proliferation in itself is abnormal.

==Causes==
Hyperplasia may be due to any number of causes, including increased [[demand (disambiguation)|demand]] (for example, proliferation of basal layer of epidermis to compensate skin loss), [[Chronic inflammation|chronic inflammatory response]], [[Hormone disorder|hormonal dysfunction]]s, or [[Compensatory growth (organ)|compensation]] for [[injury|damage]] or [[disease]] elsewhere. Hyperplasia may be harmless and occur on a particular tissue. An example of a normal hyperplastic response would be the growth and multiplication of milk-secreting [[gland]]ular cells in the [[breast]] as a response to [[pregnancy]], thus preparing for future [[breast feeding]].

Hyperplasia may also be induced artificially by injecting [[hormone]]s such as [[IGF-1]] and [[human growth hormone]].
Perhaps the most interesting and potent effect IGF has on the human body is its ability to cause hyperplasia, which is an actual splitting of cells.{{or|date=October 2009}} By contrast, [[hypertrophy]] is what occurs, for example, to skeletal muscle cells during [[weight training]] and [[steroid use]] and is simply an increase in the size of the cells. With IGF use, one is able to cause hyperplasia which actually increases the number of muscle cells present in the tissue. Weight training with or without [[anabolic steroid]] use enables these new cells to mature in size and strength. In addition, animal tests have shown that stretching a muscle can trigger hyperplasia, though this phenomenon has yet to be confirmed in humans. Hyperplasia may also be induced through specific power output training for athletic performance, thus increasing the number of muscle fibers instead of increasing the size of a single fiber.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Antonio J, Gonyea WJ |title=Muscle fiber splitting in stretch-enlarged avian muscle |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc. |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages= 973–977 |year=1994 |month=Aug |pmid=7968431 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Hyperplasia may also occur abnormally, and is associated with a variety of clinical diseases.

==Examples in human biology and disease==
[[File:Hemihyper.jpg|thumb|Patient with hemihyperplasia involving the upper and lower left extremities. The leg length discrepancy can be noted by the pelvic tilt.]]
Some of the more commonly known clinical forms of hyperplasia, or conditions leading to hyperplasia, are:
* '''[[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]]''', also known as prostate enlargement.
* '''[[Cushing's disease]]''' – Physiopathology of hyperplasia of adrenal cortex due to increased circulating level of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).
* '''[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]'''
* '''[[Endometrial hyperplasia]]''' – Hyperproliferation of the endometrium, usually in response to unopposed [[estrogen]] stimulation in the setting of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] or exogenous administration of hormones. Atypical endometrial hyperplasia may represent an early [[neoplasia|neoplastic process]] which can lead to [[endometrial cancer|endometrial adenocarcinoma]].
* '''Hemihyperplasia''' when only half (or one side) of the body is affected, sometimes generating limbs of different lengths.
* '''[[Hyperplasia of the breast]]''' – "Hyperplastic" lesions of the [[breast]] include ''usual ductal hyperplasia'', a focal expansion of the number of cells in a terminal breast duct, and ''atypical ductal hyperplasia'', in which a more abnormal pattern of growth is seen, and which is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The biology of these lesions is the subject of dispute, with some authorities arguing that both of these lesions are the result of [[neoplasia]], and that the application of the term "hyperplasia" in this instance is "inaccurate."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tavassoli FA |title=Breast pathology: rationale for adopting the ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN) classification |journal=Nature Clinical Practice. Oncology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages= 116–117 |year=2005 |pmid=16264885 |doi=10.1038/ncponc0109}}</ref>
* '''[[Intimal hyperplasia]]''' – The  thickening of the [[Tunica intima]] of a blood vessel as a complication of a reconstruction procedure or [[endarterectomy]]. Intimal hyperplasia is the universal response of a vessel to injury and is an important reason of late bypass graft failure, particularly in vein and synthetic vascular grafts.
* '''Focal epithelial hyperplasia''' (also known as Heck's disease) – This is a wart-like growth in the mucous tissues of the mouth or, rarely, throat that is caused by certain sub-types of the [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV). Heck's disease has not been known to cause cancer.
* '''[[Sebaceous hyperplasia]]''' – In this condition, small yellowish growths develop on the skin, usually on the face. This condition is neither contagious nor dangerous.
* '''Compensatory [[liver]] hyperplasia''' – The liver undergoes cellular division after acute injury, resulting in new cells that restore liver function back to baseline. Approximately 75% of the liver can be acutely damaged or resected with seemingly full regeneration through [[hepatocyte]] division, i.e., hyperplasia. This is what makes living-donor liver transplants possible.
