'''Pel-Ebstein fever''' is a rarely seen condition noted in patients with [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] in which the patient experiences [[fever]]s which cyclicly increase then decrease over an average period of one or two weeks.<ref name="Mauch"/> A cyclic fever may also be associated with other conditions, but it is not called "Pel-Ebstein fever" unless the fever is associated with Hodgkin's.<ref name="Hochberg">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1770.htm |title=eMedicine - Pel-Ebstein Fever : Article by Ephraim P Hochberg, MD |accessdate=2007-07-08 |work=}}</ref>

==Causes==
The cause is currently unknown although speculation centers on host immune response - particularly the cyclical release of [[cytokines]], lymph node [[necrosis]], and damaged stromal cells.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ree | first=HJ | title=Stromal macrophage-histiocytes in Hodgkin's disease.  Their relation to fever | journal=Cancer | volume=60 | issue=1479 | year=1987 | pmid=3621125 | doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19871001)60:7<1479::AID-CNCR2820600713>3.0.CO;2-G | pages=1479–84}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment with [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents]] or treatment of the underlying Hodgkin's (usually with [[chemotherapy]]) will help the symptoms.<ref name="Mauch">{{cite book | last=Mauch | first=Peter | coauthors=James Armitage, Volker Diehl, Richard Hoppe, Laurence Weiss | title=Hodgkin's Disease | publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] | year=1999 | pages=327–328 | isbn=0-7817-1502-4 }}</ref>

==Eponym==
The condition is named after [[Wilhelm Ebstein]] and [[P.K. Pel]] who both published papers in 1887 noting the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ebstein | first=Wilhelm | authorlink=Wilhelm Ebstein | title=Das chronische Ruckfallsfieber, eine neue Infectionskrankheit | journal=Berlin Klin Wochenschr | volume=24 | issue=565 
| year=1887 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Pel | first=PK | title=Pseudoleukaemie oder chronisches Ruckfallsfieber? | journal=Berlin Klin Wochenschr | volume=24 | issue=565 | year=1887 }}</ref><ref name="WhoNamedIt">{{WhoNamedIt|synd|438}}</ref>  Both doctors published in the same journal, though Pel published first by several months.  Interestingly, a long-term dispute persisted between Pel and Ebstein on the [[etiology]] of the condition.

==Controversy==
Researchers have speculated whether this condition truly exists, since some authorities anecdotally 
estimate only a 5-10% occurrence rate.<ref name="Hochberg" /> In his Lettsomian Lecture ''Making Sense'', delivered to the Medical Society of London in 1959, [[Richard Asher]] refers to Pel-Ebstein fever as an example of a condition that exists only because it has a name.  "Every student and every doctor knows that cases of Hodgkin's disease may show a fever that is high for one week and low for the next week and so on. Does this phenomenon really exist at all?..." <ref>{{Cite journal
