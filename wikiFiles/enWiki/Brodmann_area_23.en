'''Brodmann area 23''' (BA23) is a region in the [[brain]] corresponding to some portion of the [[posterior cingulate cortex]]. It lies between [[Brodmann area 30]] and [[Brodmann area 31]] and is located on the medial wall of the [[cingulate gyrus]] between the [[callosal sulcus]] and the [[cingulate sulcus]].

==Human==
This area is also known as '''ventral posterior cingulate area 23'''. It is a subdivision of the [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitecturally]] defined [[cingulate region]] of [[cerebral cortex]]. In the human it occupies most of the [[posterior cingulate gyrus]] adjacent to the [[corpus callosum]]. At the caudal extreme it is bounded approximately by the [[parieto-occipital sulcus]]. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded dorsally by the [[dorsal posterior cingulate area 31]], rostrally by the [[ventral anterior cingulate area 24]], and ventrorostrally in its caudal half by the [[retrosplenial region]] (Brodmann-1909).

==Guenon==
'''Brodmann area 23''' is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the [[guenon]] defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. Brodmann regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the combined ventral posterior cingulate area 23 and dorsal posterior cingulate [[Brodmann area 31]] of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive Features (Brodmann-1905): the cortex is relatively thin; smaller cells predominate; the cell density of the [[multiform layer]] (VI) is great, producing a distinct boundary with the subcortical [[white matter]]; the internal [[granular layer]] (IV) is rather well developed; the internal [[pyramidal layer]] (V) contains a dense population of round, medium-sized [[ganglion cell]]s concentrated at the border with layer IV; layers V and VI are narrow with a distinct mutual boundary.

== Macaque ==
In the [[macaque]] the researchers Bonin and Bailey describe an area they term LC which is in agreement with Brodmann area 23. The LC area 
: ''covers the posterior part of the cingulate gyrus and extends into the cingulate sulcus where, on the inferior wall, it is continuous with the frontal cortex FDL''.<ref>[[Gerhardt von Bonin]], [[Percival Bailey]], ''The Neocortex of Macaca Mulatta'', 1947.</ref>

==Subdivisions==
The area has been subdivided further: In the [[macaque]] ([[Macaca fascicularis]])   the following subdivisions have been suggested:<ref>Y. Kobayashi, D. G. Amaral, ''[[Journal of Comparative Neurology]]'', 426:339+</ref> 

* 23i (internal)
* 23e (external)
* 23v (ventral), the most caudalventral (inferior) portion and with most highly developed layer IV.

Another suggestion is for [[macaque]] ([[Macaca mulatta]])<ref>Brent A. Vogt, D. N. Pandya, D. L. Rosene, " Cingulate cortex of the rhesus monkey: I. Cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents", ''[[Journal of Comparative Neurology]]'', 262(2):256-270.</ref>

* 23a, adjacent to the [[callosal sulcus]] thus closest to [[Brodmann area 30]].
* 23b
* 23c

Further division of 23b is.<ref>H. Shibata, M. Yukie, "Differential thalamic connections of the posteroventral and dorsal posterior cingulate gyrus in the monkey". ''[[European Journal of Neuroscience]]''.</ref>  

* pv23b, posteroventral part for 23b, main [[thalamus|thalamic]] projections from anterior nuclei.
* d23b, dorsal part of 23b, weak connections from the anterior nuclei.
