A '''limited symptom attack''' ('''LSA'''), also referred to as a '''limited symptom panic attack''' ('''LPA'''), is a milder, less comprehensive form of [[panic attack]], with fewer than 4 [[panic]] related symptoms being experienced (APA 1994). For example, a sudden episode of intense [[dizziness]] or [[trembling]] accompanied by [[fear]] that something terrible is about to happen. Many people with [[panic disorder]] have a mixture of full blown and limited symptom attacks. LSAs often manifest in [[anxiety disorders]], [[phobias]], [[panic disorder]] and [[agoraphobia]]. However, experiencing a LSA is not necessarily indicative of [[mental illness]]. Often persons recovering from and/or being treated for [[panic attacks]] and [[panic disorder]] will experience LSAs.

== Symptoms ==

According to the [[DSM-IV]], during a LSA, '''fewer than''' 4 of the following symptoms would be experienced, in contrast to a full blown [[panic attack]], which must include 4 or more symptoms.

* [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath)
* [[heart palpitations]]
* [[trembling]]
* [[dizziness]]
* [[chest pain]]
* [[perspiration]]
* [[hot flash]]es
* [[headache]]
* [[derealization]]
* [[paresthesia]]
* [[hyperventilation]]
* [[nausea]]
* [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]
* [[lightheadedness]]
* burning sensations
* choking sensations
* fear of dying
* fear of [[insanity]]

== Duration ==

As with a [[panic attack]], a LSA typically peaks in 10 minutes. However, attacks can be as short as 1 to 5 minutes or can form a series of episodes waxing and waning for a period of hours.
