'''Receptor editing''' is a process that occurs during the maturation of [[B cells]], which are part of the adaptive immune system. This process forms part of [[central tolerance]] to attempt to change the specificity of the [[antigen]] receptor of self reactive immature B-cells, in order to rescue them from programmed cell death, called [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid8848883">{{cite journal | author = Meffre, E, Wardemann, H  | title = B-cell tolerance checkpoints in health and autoimmunity. | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 632–638 | year = 2008 | month = | pmid = 8848883 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2008.09.001 }}</ref> It is thought that 20-50% of all peripheral naive B cells have undergone receptor editing making it the most common method of removing self reactive B cells.<ref name="pmid15156139">{{cite journal | author = Halverson R, Torres RM, Pelanda R | title = Receptor editing is the main mechanism of B cell tolerance toward membrane antigens | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 645–650 | year = | month = | pmid = 15156139 | doi = 10.1038/ni1076 }}</ref>

During maturation in the bone marrow, B cells are tested for interaction with self antigens, which is called [[negative selection]]. If the maturing B cells strongly interact with these self antigens, they undergo death by apoptosis. Negative selection is important to avoid the production of B cells that could cause [[autoimmune diseases]]. They can avoid apoptosis by modifying the sequence of light chain V and J genes (components of the antigen receptor) so that it has a different specificity and may not recognize self antigens anymore. This process of changing the specificity of the immature B cell receptor is called receptor editing.
