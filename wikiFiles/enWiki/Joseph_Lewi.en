'''Joseph Lewi''' (August 17, 1820, [[Radnice|Radnitz]] ({{lang-cs|[[Radnice]]}}), [[Bohemia]] - December 19, 1897, [[Albany, New York]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] of [[History of the Jews in the Czech Republic|Czech Jewish]] extraction.

He was educated at the universities of [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]]. After graduating from the latter university ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] 1846), he was appointed assistant at the Vienna Lying-in Hospital. In 1847, he began to practise in Radnitz, but in the following year, that of the Revolution, emigrated to America, settling in Albany in 1849. There he was appointed on the staff of the Albany hospital, and became a member and later president of the [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] Medical Society, and senior censor of the State Medical Society. Lewi was one of the forty-two citizens of Albany who organized, in 1863, the [[Union League]] in that city.

Thirteen of Lewi's fourteen children survived him. The oldest son was the journalist [[Isidor Lewi]] (born May 9, 1850, [[Albany, New York|Albany]] - 1938<ref>[http://yulib.mc.yu.edu:8000/cgi-bin/gw/yulis?host=localhost%2B2222%2BDEFAULT&search=KEYWORD&function=CARDSCR&SourceScreen=INITREQ&sessionid=200701221058581933402&skin=portal&conf=.%2Fchameleon.conf&lng=en&itemu1=2008&scant1=Isaac%20(Biblical%20patriarch)%20Legends.&scanu1=21&u1=2008&t1=000405481&elementcount=3&pos=5&prevpos=1&rootsearch=1&], [http://digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=364863&local_base=GEN01]</ref>). He was educated at [[The Albany Academy]], became connected with several newspapers, and is at present (1904) an editorial writer on the ''"[[New York Tribune]]"'' and publisher of the "New Era Illustrated Magazine." Another son, Maurice J. Lewi (born Albany December 1, 1857), was a physician in New York City. He graduated from the [[Albany Medical College]] in 1877. After a postgraduate course in [[Heidelberg]] and Vienna he began to practise in his native town (1880). He became lecturer at the Albany Medical College and professor of medical jurisprudence at the [[Albany Law School]]. In 1891, he was appointed secretary of the state board of medical examiners.
