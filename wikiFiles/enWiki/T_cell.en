'''T cells''' or '''T lymphocytes''' belong to a group of [[white blood cell]]s known as [[lymphocyte]]s, and play a central role in [[cell-mediated immunity]]. They can be distinguished from other lymphocytes, such as [[B cell]]s and [[natural killer cell]]s (NK cells), by the presence of a ''[[T-cell receptor]]'' (TCR) on the cell surface. They are called ''T'' cells because they mature in the [[thymus]]. There are several subsets of T cells, each with a distinct function.

== Types ==

=== Helper ===

[[T helper cell]] (T<sub>H</sub> cells) assist other white blood cells in immunologic processes, including maturation of [[B cell]]s into [[plasma cell]]s and [[memory B cell]]s, and activation of cytotoxic T cells and [[macrophage]]s. These cells are also known as '''CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells''' because they express the [[CD4]] glycoprotein on their surface. Helper T cells become activated when they are presented with peptide [[antigen]]s by [[MHC class II]] molecules, which are expressed on the surface of [[antigen presenting cell]]s (APCs). Once activated, they divide rapidly and secrete small proteins called [[cytokine]]s that regulate or assist in the active immune response. These cells can differentiate into one of several subtypes, including [[T helper cell|T<sub>H</sub>1]], [[Th2|T<sub>H</sub>2]], [[Th3|T<sub>H</sub>3]], [[Th17|T<sub>H</sub>17]], or [[ThF|T<sub>FH</sub>]], which secrete different cytokines to facilitate a different type of immune response. Signalling from the APC directs T cells into particular subtypes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Journal of Clinical Investigation |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/31720 |title=APC-derived cytokines and T cell polarization in autoimmune inflammation |publisher=Jci.org |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref>

=== Cytotoxic ===

'''[[Cytotoxic T cell]]s''' (T<sub>C</sub> cells, or CTLs) destroy virally infected cells and tumor cells, and are also implicated in [[Organ transplant|transplant]] rejection. These cells are also known as '''CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells''' since they express the [[CD8]] glycoprotein at their surface. These cells recognize their targets by binding to antigen associated with [[MHC class I]], which is present on the surface of all nucleated cells. Through IL-10, adenosine and other molecules secreted by regulatory T cells, the CD8<sup>+</sup> cells can be inactivated to an anergic state, which prevent [[autoimmune]] diseases such as [[experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis]].<ref name="pmid15520848">{{cite journal | author = Jiang H, Chess L | title = An integrated view of suppressor T cell subsets in immunoregulation | journal = J.

=== Memory ===
'''[[Memory T cell]]s''' are a subset of [[antigen]]-specific T cells that persist long-term after an infection has resolved. They quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon re-exposure to their cognate antigen, thus providing the immune system with "memory" against past infections. Memory T cells comprise two subtypes: central memory T cells (T<sub>CM</sub> cells) and effector memory T cells (T<sub>EM</sub> cells). Memory cells may be either CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup>. Memory T cells typically express the cell surface protein CD45RO.<ref name="pmid2965180">{{cite journal | author = Akbar AN, Terry L, Timms A, Beverley PC, Janossy G | title = Loss of CD45R and gain of UCHL1 reactivity is a feature of primed T cells | journal = J.

===Regulatory===
'''[[Regulatory T cell]]s''' (T<sub>reg</sub> cells), formerly known as '''suppressor T cells''', are crucial for the maintenance of [[immunological tolerance]]. Their major role is to shut down T cell-mediated immunity toward the end of an immune reaction and to suppress auto-reactive T cells that escaped the process of negative selection in the thymus.

Two major classes of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells have been described — naturally occurring T<sub>reg</sub> cells and adaptive T<sub>reg</sub> cells.

Naturally occurring T<sub>reg</sub> cells (also known as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells) arise in the [[thymus]] and have been linked to interactions between developing T cells with both [[myeloid dendritic cells|myeloid]] (CD11c+) and [[plasmacytoid dendritic cells|plasmacytoid]] (CD123+) dendritic cells that have been activated with [[TSLP]].<ref name="pmid16121185">{{cite journal | author = Watanabe N, Wang YH, Lee HK, Ito T, Wang YH, Cao W, Liu YJ | title = Hassall's corpuscles instruct dendritic cells to induce CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in human thymus | journal = Nature | volume = 436 | issue = 7054 | pages = 1181–5 | year = 2005 | month = August | pmid = 16121185 | doi = 10.1038/nature03886 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid20173030">{{cite journal | author = Hanabuchi S, Ito T, Park WR, Watanabe N, Shaw JL, Roman E, Arima K, Wang YH, Voo KS, Cao W, Liu YJ | title = Thymic stromal lymphopoietin-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells induce the generation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in human thymus | journal = J.

Mutations of the ''FOXP3'' gene can prevent regulatory T cell development, causing the fatal [[autoimmune disease]] [[IPEX (syndrome)|IPEX]].

Adaptive T<sub>reg</sub> cells (also known as Tr1 cells or Th3 cells) may originate during a normal immune response.

=== Natural killer ===

'''[[Natural killer T cell]]s''' (NKT cells – not to be confused with [[natural killer cell]]s of the innate immune system) bridge the [[adaptive immune system]] with the [[innate immune system]]. Unlike conventional T cells that recognize peptide antigens presented by [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) molecules, NKT cells recognize glycolipid antigen presented by a molecule called [[CD1d]]. Once activated, these cells can perform functions ascribed to both T<sub>h</sub> and T<sub>c</sub> cells (i.e., cytokine production and release of cytolytic/cell killing molecules). They are also able to recognize and eliminate some tumor cells and cells infected with herpes viruses.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

=== Mucosal associated invariant  ===

'''[[Mucosal associated invariant T cell]]s''' (MAITs) are a special type of T cell.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== γδ ==

'''[[γδ T cells]]''' ([[gamma]] [[Delta (letter)|delta]] T cells) represent a small subset of T cells that possess a distinct [[T cell receptor]] (TCR) on their surface. A majority of T cells have a [[T cell receptor|TCR]] composed of two [[glycoprotein]] chains called α- and β- TCR chains. However, in γδ T cells, the TCR is made up of one γ-chain and one δ-chain. This group of T cells is much less common in humans and mice( ~2% of Total T cells); and are found in the  highest abundance in the gut [[mucosa]], within a population of lymphocytes known as [[intraepithelial lymphocyte]]s (IELs). In rabbits, sheep, and chickens the number of gamma delta T cells can be as high as 60% of total T cells. The antigenic molecules that activate γδ T cells are still widely unknown. However, γδ T cells are not MHC restricted and seem to be able to recognize whole proteins rather than requiring peptides to be presented by MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells. Some murine γδ T cells recognize MHC class IB molecules though. Human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells, which constitute the major γδ T cell population in peripheral blood, are unique in that they specifically and rapidly respond to a set of non-peptidic phosphorylated [[isoprenoid]] precursors, collectively named [[phosphoantigen]]s. Phosphoantigens are produced by virtually all living cells. The most common phosphoantigens from animal and human cells (including cancer cells) are [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) and its isomer [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP). Many microbes produce the highly active compound hydroxy-DMAPP ([[HMB-PP]]) and corresponding mononucleotide conjugates, in addition to IPP and DMAPP. Plant cells produce both types of phosphoantigens. Drugs activating human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells comprise synthetic phosphoantigens and [[bisphosphonates|aminobisphosphonates]], which up-regulate endogenous IPP/DMAPP.

== Development in the thymus ==<!-- This section is linked from [[apoptosis]] -->
{{see also|Thymocyte}}
All T cells originate from [[haematopoietic stem cell]]s in the [[bone marrow]]. Haematopoietic progenitors derived from [[haematopoietic stem cell]]s populate the [[thymus]] and expand by cell division to generate a large population of immature [[thymocytes]].<ref name="pmid16448533">{{cite journal | author = Schwarz BA, Bhandoola A | title = Trafficking from the bone marrow to the thymus: a prerequisite for thymopoiesis | journal = Immunol. Rev. | volume = 209 | issue = | pages = 47–57 | year = 2006 | month = February | pmid = 16448533 | doi = 10.1111/j.0105-2896.2006.00350.x }}</ref> The earliest [[thymocytes]] express neither CD4 nor CD8, and are therefore classed as ''double-negative'' (CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>) cells. As they progress through their development they become ''double-positive'' thymocytes (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>), and finally mature to ''single-positive'' (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> or CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) thymocytes that are then released from the [[thymus]] to peripheral tissues.

About 98% of [[thymocytes]] die during the development processes in the thymus by failing either '''positive selection''' or '''negative selection''', whereas the other 2% survive and leave the thymus to become mature immunocompetent T cells.

The thymus contributes fewer cells as a person ages. As the thymus shrinks by about 3%<ref name="pmid10837068">{{cite journal | author = Haynes BF, Markert ML, Sempowski GD, Patel DD, Hale LP | title = The role of the thymus in immune reconstitution in aging, bone marrow transplantation, and HIV-1 infection | journal = Annu.

=== Beta selection ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
Common lymphoid precursor cells that arrive at the thymus and become known as T-cell precursors. When they begin to express [[c-kit]] and [[CD44]], they become known as DN1 thymocytes. At this stage they must create a unique T-cell receptor through [[V(D)J recombination]]. As the TCRβ locus begins to be rearranged the DN1 cell begins to express CD25 and becomes a DN2 thymocyte. At this point a T-cell will either progress towards the Helper/Killer linage or the [[γδ T cell]] lineage. The DN2 cell begins to express [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] and stops expressing c-kit and CD44 becoming a DN3 thymocyte. At this stage the thymocyte must produce a TCRβ beta chain that can be translated into protein and travel to the cell surface with a Pre-T alpha chain. If this occurs, the cell has passed beta selection and will stop expressing CD25. It will also rapidly proliferate. The cell will start to express both CD4 and CD8 and becomes known as a DP thymocyte.

=== Positive selection ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
Positive selection "selects for" T cells capable of interacting with MHC. Double-positive [[thymocyte]]s (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>) move deep into the thymic [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] where they are presented with self-[[antigen]]s. These self-antigens are expressed by thymic cortical epithelial cells that express [[Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase]] on both [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] molecules on the surface of cortical epithelial cells. Only those thymocytes that interact with MHC-I or MHC-II appropriately (i.e. not too strongly or too weakly) will receive a vital "survival signal." All that can't will die by "death by neglect" (no survival signal) if they do not interact strongly enough, or apoptosis if they bind too strongly. This process ensures that the selected T-cells will have an MHC affinity that can serve useful functions in the body (i.e. the cells must be able to interact with MHC and peptide complexes in order to effect immune responses). The vast majority of all thymocytes end up dying during this process.

A thymocyte's fate is determined during positive selection. Double-positive cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>) that interact well with MHC class II molecules will eventually become CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, while thymocytes that interact well with MHC class I molecules mature into CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. A T cell becomes a CD4<sup>+</sup> cell by down-regulating expression of its CD8 cell surface receptors. If the cell does not lose its signal through the ITAM pathway, it will continue down-regulating CD8 and become a CD4<sup>+</sup>, single positive cell. But if there is a signal interruption, the cell stops downregulating CD8 and switches over to downregulating CD4 molecules instead, eventually becoming a CD8<sup>+</sup>, single positive cell.

This process does not remove thymocytes that may cause [[autoimmunity]]. The potentially autoimmune cells are removed by the process of ''negative selection'', which occurs in the thymic medulla (discussed below.

=== Negative selection ===
Negative selection removes thymocytes that are capable of strongly binding with "self" peptides presented by MHC. Thymocytes that survive positive selection migrate towards the boundary of the thymic cortex and thymic medulla. While in the medulla, they are again presented with self-antigen in complex with MHC molecules on medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs).<ref name="pmid20431619">{{cite journal | author = Hinterberger M, Aichinger M, Prazeres da Costa O, Voehringer D, Hoffmann R, Klein L | title = Autonomous role of medullary thymic epithelial cells in central CD4(+) T cell tolerance | journal = Nat. Immunol. | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 512–9 | year = 2010 | month = June | pmid = 20431619 | doi = 10.1038/ni.1874 }}</ref> mTECs must be AIRE+ to properly express self-antigens from all tissues of the body on their MHC class I peptides. Some mTECs are phagocytosed by thymic dendritic cells; this allows for presentation of self-antigens on MHC class II molecules (positively selected CD4+ cells must interact with MHC class II molecules, thus APCs, which possess MHC class II, must be present for CD4+ T-cell negative selection). Thymocytes that interact too strongly with the self-antigen receive an [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] signal that leads to cell death. However, some of these cells are selected to become [[Treg]] cells. The remaining cells exit the thymus as mature [[naive T cell]]s (also known as Recent Thymic Emigrants). This process is an important component of [[central tolerance]] and serves to prevent the formation of self-reactive T cells that are capable of inducing [[autoimmune disease]]s in the host.

In summary, β-selection is the first checkpoint, where the T cells that are able to form a functional pre-TCR with an invariant alpha chain and a functional Beta chain are allowed to continue development in the thymus. Next, positive selection checks that T cells have successfully re-arranged their TCRα locus and are capable of recognizing peptide-MHC complexes with appropriate affinity. Negative selection in the medulla then obliterates T cells that bind too strongly to self-antigens expressed on MHC molecules. These selection processes allow for tolerance of self by the immune system. Typical T-cells that leave the thymus (via the corticomedullarly junction) are self-restricted, self-tolerant, and singly positive.

== Activation ==
[[Image:T cell activation.svg|300px|thumb|T cell activation {{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}]]

Activation of CD4+ T cells occurs through the simultaneous engagement of  the [[T cell receptor]] and a costimulatory molecule like ( [[CD28]], or ICOS) on the T cell by the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHCII) [[peptide]] and costimulatory molecules  on the [[antigen-presenting cell|APC]]. Both are required for production of an effective immune response; in the absence of  [[co-stimulation]], T-cell receptor signalling alone results in [[anergy]]. The signalling pathways downstream from costimulatory molecules usually engages the PI3K pathway generating PIP3 at the plasma membrane and recruiting PH domain containing signaling molecules like, PDK1 that are essential for the activation of PKCtheta, and eventual IL-2 production.

The first signal is provided by binding of the T cell receptor its cognate peptide presented on MHCII on an antigen presenting cell. MHCII is restricted to so called professional antigen presenting cells, like dendritic cells, B cells and macophages to name a few. The peptides presented to [[CD8]]<sup>+</sup> T cells by MHC class I molecules are 8–9 amino acids in length; the peptides presented to [[CD4]]<sup>+</sup> cells by [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class II molecules are longer, usually 12–25 amino acids in length,<ref>Jennifer Rolland and Robyn O'Hehir, "Turning off the T-cells: Peptides for treatment of allergic Diseases," Today's life science publishing, 1999, Page 32</ref> as the ends of the binding cleft of the MHC class II molecule are open.

The second signal comes from co-stimulation, in which surface receptors on the APC are induced by a relatively small number of stimuli, usually products of pathogens, but sometimes breakdown products of cells, such as [[necrosis|necrotic]]-bodies or [[heat shock proteins]]. The only co-stimulatory receptor expressed constitutively by naïve T cells is CD28, so co-stimulation for these cells comes from the [[CD80]] and [[CD86]] proteins, which together constitute the [[B7 (protein)|B7]] protein, (B7.1 and B7.2 respectively) on the APC. Other receptors are expressed upon activation of the T cell, such as [[OX40]] and [[CD278|ICOS]], but these largely depend upon CD28 for their expression. The second signal licenses the T cell to respond to an antigen. Without it, the T cell becomes [[anergy|anergic]], and it becomes more difficult for it to activate in future. This mechanism prevents inappropriate responses to self, as self-peptides will not usually be presented with suitable co-stimulation.

The [[T cell receptor]] exists as a complex of several proteins. The actual T cell receptor is composed of two separate peptide chains, which are produced from the independent T cell receptor alpha and beta (TCRα and TCRβ) genes. The other proteins in the complex are the [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] proteins: CD3εγ and CD3εδ heterodimers and, most important, a CD3ζ homodimer, which has a total of six [[immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif|ITAM]] motifs. The ITAM motifs on the CD3ζ can be phosphorylated by [[Lck]] and in turn recruit [[ZAP70|ZAP-70]]. Lck and/or ZAP-70 can also phosphorylate the [[tyrosines]] on many other molecules, not least CD28, [[Linker of activated T cells|LAT]] and [[Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2|SLP-76]], which allows the aggregation of signalling complexes around these proteins.

Phosphorylated [[linker of activated T cells|LAT]] recruits SLP-76 to the membrane, where it can then bring in [[Phosphoinositide phospholipase C|PLC-γ]], [[VAV1]], [[ITK (gene)|Itk]] and potentially [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]]. Both PLC-γ and PI3K act on PI(4,5)P2 on the inner leaflet of the membrane to create the active intermediaries diacylglycerol ([[Diglyceride|DAG]]), inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate ([[inositol trisphosphate|IP3]]), and phosphatidlyinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate ([[PIP3]]). DAG binds and activates some PKCs.  Most important in T cells is [[PKCθ]], critical for activating the transcription factors [[NF-κB]] and AP-1. [[Inositol triphosphate|IP3]] is released from the membrane by PLC-γ and diffuses rapidly to activate calcium channel receptors on the [[endoplasmic reticulum|ER]], which induces the release of [[calcium in biology|calcium]] into the cytosol.  Low calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum causes STIM1 clustering on the ER membrane and leads to activation of cell membrane CRAC channels that allows additional calcium to flow into the cytosol from the extracellular space. This aggregated cytosolic calcium binds calmodulin which can then activate [[calcineurin]], calcineurin, in turn, activates [[NFAT]] which then translocates to the nucleus. NFAT is a [[transcription factor]], which activates the transcription of a pleiotropic set of genes, most notable, [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]], a cytokine that promotes long term proliferation of activated T cells.

PLCγ can also initiate the NF-κB pathway. DAG activates PKCθ, which then phosphorylates CARMA1 causing it to unfold and function as a scaffold. The cytosolic domains bind an adapter Cbl 10 via CARD (Caspase activation and recruitment domains) domains; that then binds TRAF6, which is ubiquitinated at K63.{{rp:513–523}}<ref name="isbn0-12-289632-7"/>  This form of ubiquitination does not lead to degradation of target proteins.

While in most cases activation is dependent on TCR recognition of antigen, alternative pathways for activation have been described. For example, cytotoxic T cells have been shown to become activated when targeted by other CD8 T cells leading to tolerization of the latter.<ref name="pmid21045195">{{cite journal | author = Milstein O, Hagin D, Lask A, Reich-Zeliger S, Shezen E, Ophir E, Eidelstein Y, Afik R, Antebi YE, Dustin ML, Reisner Y | title = CTLs respond with activation and granule secretion when serving as targets for T-cell recognition | journal = Blood | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 1042–52 | year = 2011 | month = January | pmid = 21045195 | pmc = 3035066 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2010-05-283770 }}</ref>
