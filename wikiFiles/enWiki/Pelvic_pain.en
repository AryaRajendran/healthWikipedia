'''Pelvic pain''' is a symptom that can affect both women and men.  The pelvic [[pain]] that persists for a period of 6 months or more to be considered chronic while less than this duration is considered acute. The pain may indicate the existence of poorly understood conditions that likely represent abnormal psychoneuromuscular function. Differentiating between acute and chronic pain is important in understanding chronic pelvic pain syndromes. Acute pain is most common, often experienced by patients after surgery or other soft tissue traumas. It tends to be immediate, severe and short lived however, pain that extends beyond a normal recovery period and lasts longer than 3–6 months constitutes '''[[chronic pain]]'''.<ref name="Jantos">{{cite journal |author=Marek Jantos  |title=Understanding Chronic Pelvic Pain |journal=Pelviperineology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=66–69 |year=2007 |url=http://www.pelviperineology.org/practical/chronic_pelvic_pain.html}}</ref>

==Female==
Most women, at some time in their lives, experience pelvic pain. As girls enter puberty, pelvic or abdominal pain becomes a frequent complaint.
 
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) accounts for 10% of all visits to gynecologists. In addition, CPP is the reason for 20—30% of all laparoscopies in adults.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Cause===
Many different conditions can cause pelvic pain including:
* exaggerated bladder, bowel, or uterine pain sensitivity (also known as visceral pain)
* [[pelvic girdle pain]] (SPD or DSP)

; Gynecologic
* [[Dysmenorrhea]]—pain during the menstrual period
* [[Endometriosis]]—pain caused by uterine tissue that is outside the uterus
* [[Müllerian abnormalities]]
* [[Pelvic inflammatory disease]]—pain caused by damage from infections
* [[Ovarian cyst]]s—the [[ovary]] produces a large, painful cyst, which may rupture
* [[Ovarian torsion]]—the ovary is twisted in a way that interferes with its blood supply
* [[Ectopic pregnancy]]—a pregnancy implanted outside the uterus

; Abdominal
* [[Loin pain hematuria syndrome]]
* [[Proctitis]]—infection or inflammation of the anus or rectum
* [[Colitis]]—infection or inflammation of the colon
* [[Appendicitis]]—infection or inflammation of the bowel

[[Internal hernia]]s are difficult to identify in women, and misdiagnosis with [[endometriosis]] or idiopathic [[chronic pelvic pain]] is very common.  One cause of misdiagnosis that when the woman lies down flat on an examination table, all of the [[medical sign]]s of the hernia disappear.  The hernia can typically only be detected when symptoms are present, so diagnosis requires positioning the woman's body in a way that provokes symptoms.<ref name=Brody>Brody, Jane E.

===Workup===
The diagnostic workup begins with a careful history and examination, followed by a [[pregnancy test]].  Some women may also need bloodwork or additional imaging studies, and a handful may also benefit from having surgical evaluation.

The absence of visible pathology in chronic pain syndromes should not form the basis for either seeking psychological explanations or questioning the reality of the patient’s pain. Instead it is essential to approach the complexity of chronic pain from a psychophysiological perspective which recognises the importance of the mind-body interaction. Some of the mechanisms by which the limbic system impacts on pain, and in particular myofascial pain, have been clarified by research findings in neurology and psychophysiology.<ref name="Jantos"/>

===Treatment===
Many women will benefit from a consultation with a physical therapist, [http://www.pelvicpaintherapy.co.uk pelvic pain therapist],  a trial of anti-inflammatory medications, hormonal therapy, or even neurological agents.

A [[hysterectomy]] is sometimes performed.<ref name="pmid20177285">{{cite journal |author=Kuppermann M, Learman LA, Schembri M, ''et al.'' |title=Predictors of hysterectomy use and satisfaction |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=543–51 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20177285 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181cf46a0 |url=}}</ref>

Chronic pelvic pain in men is referred to as Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) and is also known as ''chronic nonbacterial prostatitis''.

===Differential diagnosis===
In men, chronic pelvic pain (category IIIB) is often misdiagnosed as [[chronic bacterial prostatitis]] and needlessly treated with antibiotics exposing the patient to inappropriate antibiotic use and unnecessarily to adverse effects with little if any benefit in most cases. Within a Bulgarian study, where by definition all patients had negative microbiological results, a 65% adverse drug reaction rate was found for patients treated with ciprofloxacin in comparison to a 9% rate for the placebo patients. This was combined with a higher cure rate (69% v 53%) found within the placebo group.<ref>{{cite web |author=J. Dimitrakov |coauthors=J. Tchitalov, T. Zlatanov, D.

==Epidemiology==
Chronic pelvic pain is a common condition with rate of [[dysmenorrhoea]] between 16.8—81%, [[dyspareunia]] between 8—21.8%, and noncyclical pain between 2.1—24%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Latthe P, Latthe M, Say L, Gülmezoglu M, Khan KS |title=WHO systematic review of prevalence of chronic pelvic pain: a neglected reproductive health morbidity |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=6 |issue= |page=177 |year=2006 |pmid=16824213 |pmc=1550236 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-6-177 |url=}}</ref>
