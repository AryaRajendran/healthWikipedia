The '''Polymeal''' is a diet-based approach to combatting [[cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], proposed in December 2004 by Oscar Franco, a Colombian public health scientist at the University Medical Centre in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. Franco and his colleagues suggest the "Polymeal" as a natural alternative to the "Polypill", a multi-drug-based strategy for reducing heart disease.  The researchers used the same technique in the polypill paper: a statistical "[[meta-analysis]]" which combined the results of many previous studies. The paper, appearing in the [[BMJ]]'s traditionally light-hearted Christmas issue, may be regarded as somewhat satirical, as noted in responses in the journal.

The study claims that adherence to the polymeal diet would delay the average onset of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] by nine years among men and by eight years among women.  Because cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in [[first world|first-world]] nations, this delay of heart failure would increase the average lifespan of men by six years and women by 5.5 years.

The researchers combined several food items already known to reduce the risk of heart disease:
* [[Red wine]], which contains the [[antioxidant]] [[resveratrol]], and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], which some researchers think may help to reduce [[atherosclerosis]] by reducing [[clot]]ting.
* Dark [[chocolate]] without [[dairy products]]
* [[Almond]]s
* [[Garlic]]
* [[Fish]], particularly [[oily fish]], which are sources of the [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s [[eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]].
* [[Fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s

They suggest a person should consume, every day:
* 150 mL of red wine (about one glass)
* 100 g of dark chocolate
* 400 g of fruits and vegetables
* 2.7 g of garlic
* 68 g of almonds
as well as 118 g of fish per day four times each week.

Since the Polymeal is based on principles of combating inflammation, this diet could be extended to the following foods:{{Citation needed|reason=The article is specifically based on ingredients reported in the scientific literature as reducing cardiovascular risk, so if the list below is to be considered an "extension", the extra ingredients need similar citations.|date=February 2012}}
* fruits and vegetables (as the staple)
* potatoes
* fish (other than catfish & tilapia)
* grass-fed beef (as opposed to grain-fed)
* chicken & eggs
* herbs & spices
* olive oil
* butter (ghee)
* coconut oil
* nuts
* dark chocolate (at least 85% chocolate)
* lots of water
* green tea
* red wine (dry & aged)
