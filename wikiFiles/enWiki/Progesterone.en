'''Progesterone''' also known as '''P4''' ('''p'''regn-'''4'''-ene-3,20-dione) is a C-21 [[steroid hormone]] involved in the [[female]] [[menstrual cycle]], [[pregnancy]] (supports ''[[gestation]]'') and [[embryogenesis]] of humans and other species.  Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called [[progestogens]], and is the major naturally occurring human progestogen.

Like other [[steroid]]s, progesterone consists of four interconnected [[cyclic hydrocarbon]]s. Progesterone contains [[ketone]] and oxygenated functional groups, as well as two [[methyl]] branches. Like all steroid hormones, it is [[hydrophobic]].

== Sources ==

=== Animal ===

Progesterone is produced in the [[ovaries]] (by the [[corpus luteum]]), the [[adrenal gland]]s (near the kidney), and, during pregnancy, in the [[placenta]]. Progesterone is also stored in [[Adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]].

In humans, increasing amounts of progesterone are produced during pregnancy:

* At first, the source is the corpus luteum that has been "rescued" by the presence of human chorionic gonadotropins ([[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]]) from the conceptus.

* However, after the 8th week, production of progesterone shifts to the placenta. The placenta utilizes maternal cholesterol as the initial substrate, and most of the produced progesterone enters the maternal circulation, but some is picked up by the fetal circulation and used as substrate for fetal [[corticosteroids]]. At term the placenta produces about 250&nbsp;mg progesterone per day.

* An additional source of progesterone is milk products. After consumption of milk products the level of bioavailable progesterone goes up.<ref name="titleResult Content View">{{cite web | url =http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF6852573B1007803AD | title = Milk products are a source of dietary progesterone | accessdate = 2008-03-12 | author = Goodson III WH, Handagama P, Moore II DH, Dairkee S | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2007-12-13 | format = | work = | publisher = 30th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium | pages = abstract # 2028 | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}</ref>

=== Plants ===

In at least one plant, ''[[Juglans regia]]'', progesterone has been detected.<ref name="pmid20108949">{{cite journal | author = Pauli GF, Friesen JB, Gödecke T, Farnsworth NR, Glodny B | title = Occurrence of Progesterone and Related Animal Steroids in Two Higher Plants | journal = J Nat Prod | volume = 73| issue = 3| pages = 338–45| year = 2010 | month = January | pmid = 20108949 | doi = 10.1021/np9007415 | url =  }}</ref> In addition, progesterone-like [[steroid]]s are found in ''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]''.

Another plant that contains substances readily convertible to progesterone is ''[[Dioscorea pseudojaponica]]'' native to [[Taiwan]]. Research has shown that the Taiwanese yam contains [[saponin]]s — steroids that can be converted to diosgenin and thence to progesterone.<ref name="pmid14558759">{{cite journal | author = Yang DJ, Lu TJ, Hwang LS | title = Isolation and identification of steroidal saponins in Taiwanese yam cultivar (Dioscorea pseudojaponica Yamamoto) | journal = J.

Many other ''Dioscorea'' species of the yam family contain steroidal substances from which progesterone can be produced. Among the more notable of these are ''[[Dioscorea villosa]]'' and ''[[Dioscorea polygonoides]]''.

== Synthesis ==

=== Biosynthesis ===
[[Image:Progesterone biosynthesis.png|thumb|right|550px|'''Top''': Conversion of cholesterol ('''1''') into pregnenolone ('''3''') to progesterone ('''6''').<br />'''Bottom''': Progesterone is important for [[aldosterone]] ([[mineralocorticoid]]) synthesis, as [[17-hydroxyprogesterone]] is for [[cortisol]] ([[glucocorticoid]]), and [[androstenedione]] for [[sex steroids]].]]

In mammals, progesterone ('''<u>6</u>'''), like all other [[steroid]] [[hormone]]s, is synthesized from [[pregnenolone]] ('''<u>3</u>'''),  which in turn is derived from [[cholesterol]] ('''<u>1</u>''') (see the upper half of the figure to the right).

Cholesterol ('''<u>1</u>''') undergoes double oxidation to produce 20,22-dihydroxycholesterol ('''<u>2</u>'''). This vicinal [[diol]] is then further oxidized with loss of the side chain starting at position C-22 to produce pregnenolone ('''<u>3</u>''').  This reaction is catalyzed by [[cytochrome]] [[P450scc]].
The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone takes place in two steps. First, the 3-[[hydroxyl]] group is oxidized to a [[ketone|keto]] group ('''<u>4</u>''') and second, the [[double bond]] is moved to C-4, from C-5 through a keto/[[enol]] [[tautomer]]ization reaction.<ref name="isbn0-471-49641-3">{{cite book | author = Dewick, Paul M. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Medicinal natural products: a biosynthetic approach | edition = | language = | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2002 | origyear = | pages = 244 | quote = | isbn = 0-471-49641-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>  This reaction is catalyzed by [[3-beta-HSD|3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta(5)-delta(4)isomerase]].

Progesterone in turn (see lower half of figure to the right) is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid [[aldosterone]], and after conversion to [[17-hydroxyprogesterone]] (another natural progestogen) of [[cortisol]] and [[androstenedione]]. Androstenedione can be converted to [[testosterone]], [[estrone]] and [[estradiol]].

Pregenolone and progesterone can also be synthesized by yeast.<ref name="pmid9487528">{{cite journal | author = Duport C, Spagnoli R, Degryse E, Pompon D | title = Self-sufficient biosynthesis of pregnenolone and progesterone in engineered yeast | journal = Nat.

=== Laboratory ===
[[Image:Marker snythesis.png|thumb|right|300px|The Marker [[semisynthesis]] of progesterone from [[diosgenin]].<ref name="Marker_1940"/>]]
An economical [[semisynthesis]] of progesterone from the plant steroid [[diosgenin]] isolated from yams was developed by [[Russell Earl Marker|Russell Marker]] in 1940 for the [[Parke-Davis]] pharmaceutical company (see figure to the right).<ref name="Marker_1940"/> This synthesis is known as the [[Marker degradation]]. Additional semisyntheses of progesterone have also been reported starting from a variety of steroids.  For the example, [[cortisone]] can be simultaneously deoxygenated at the C-17 and C-21 position by treatment with iodotrimethylsilane in [[chloroform]] to produce 11-keto-progesterone (ketogestin), which in turn can be reduced at position-11 to yield progesterone.<ref name="pmid3815593">{{cite journal| author = Numazawa M, Nagaoka M, Kunitama Y | title = Regiospecific deoxygenation of the dihydroxyacetone moiety at C-17 of corticoid steroids with iodotrimethylsilane | journal = Chem.

[[Image:Progesterone Synthesis.png|thumb|right|300px|The Johnson total synthesis of progesterone.<ref name="pmid5131151"/>]]

A [[total synthesis]] of progesterone was reported in 1971 by [[William Summer Johnson|W.S. Johnson]] (see figure to the right).<ref name="pmid5131151">{{cite journal | author = Johnson WS, Gravestock MB, McCarry BE | title = Acetylenic bond participation in biogenetic-like olefinic cyclizations.

The [[ketal]] [[protecting group]]s of '''<u>9</u>''' are hydrolyzed to produce the diketone '''<u>10</u>''', which in turn is cyclized to form the cyclopentenone '''<u>11</u>'''.  The ketone of '''<u>11</u>''' is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol '''<u>12</u>''', which in turn is treated with acid to produce the tertiary cation '''<u>13</u>'''.  The key step of the synthesis is the π-cation cyclization of '''<u>13</u>''' in which the B-, C-, and D-rings of the steroid are simultaneously formed to produce '''<u>14</u>'''.  This step resembles the cationic cyclization reaction used in the biosynthesis of steroids and hence is referred to as ''biomimetic''. In the next step the [[enol]] [[orthoester]] is hydrolyzed to produce the ketone '''<u>15</u>'''.  The cyclopentene A-ring is then opened by oxidizing with ozone to produce '''<u>16</u>'''.  Finally, the diketone '''<u>17</u>''' undergoes an intramolecular [[aldol condensation]] by treating with aqueous potassium hydroxide to produce progesterone.<ref name="pmid5131151"/>

== Levels ==
In women, progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the [[menstrual cycle]], rise after [[ovulation]], and are elevated during the luteal phase, as shown in diagram below. Progesterone levels tend to be < 2&nbsp;ng/ml prior to ovulation, and > 5&nbsp;ng/ml after ovulation. If [[pregnancy]] occurs, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] is released maintaining the corpus leuteum allowing it to maintain levels of progesterone. At around 12 weeks the placenta begins to produce progesterone in place of the corpus leuteum, this process is named the luteal-placental shift. After the luteal-placental shift progesterone levels start to rise further and may reach 100-200&nbsp;ng/ml at term. Whether a decrease in progesterone levels is critical for the initiation of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]] has been argued and may be species-specific. After delivery of the placenta and during lactation, progesterone levels are very low.

Progesterone levels are relatively low in children and postmenopausal women.<ref name="titleHistorical Reference Ranges">{{cite web | url = http://cclnprod.cc.nih.gov/dlm/testguide.nsf/Index/CB26894E1EB28DEF85256BA5005B000E?OpenDocument | title = Progesterone Historical Reference Ranges | accessdate = 2008-03-12 | author = NIH Clinical Center | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2004-08-16 | format = | work = | publisher = United States National Institutes of Health | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}</ref> Adult males have levels similar to those in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

Progesterone modulates the activity of [[cation channels of sperm|CatSper]] (cation channels of sperm) [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-gated]] Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs ([[chemotaxis]]).  Hence substances that block the progesterone binding site on CatSper channels could potentially be used in [[male contraception]].<ref name="pmid21412338">{{cite journal | author = Strünker T, Goodwin N, Brenker C, Kashikar ND, Weyand I, Seifert R, Kaupp UB | title = The CatSper channel mediates progesterone-induced Ca2+ influx in human sperm | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7338 | pages = 382–6 | year = 2011 | month = March | pmid = 21412338 | doi = 10.1038/nature09769 | laysummary = http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110316/full/news.2011.163.html | laysource = Nature News }}</ref><ref name="pmid21412339">{{cite journal | author = Lishko PV, Botchkina IL, Kirichok Y | title = Progesterone activates the principal Ca2+ channel of human sperm | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7338 | pages = 387–91 | year = 2011 | month = March | pmid = 21412339 | doi = 10.1038/nature09767 }}</ref>

Progesterone is sometimes called the "hormone of pregnancy",<ref name="colostate">{{cite web | url = http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/placenta/endocrine.html | title = Placental Hormones | accessdate = 2008-03-12 | author = Bowen R | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2000-08-06 | work = | publisher = | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}</ref> and it has many roles relating to the development of the fetus:
* Progesterone converts the [[endometrium]] to its secretory stage to prepare the uterus for implantation.  At the same time progesterone affects the vaginal [[epithelium]] and [[Cervix#Cervical mucus|cervical mucus]], making it thick and impenetrable to [[sperm]]. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels will decrease, leading, in the human, to [[menstruation]]. Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding. If ovulation does not occur and the corpus luteum does not develop, levels of progesterone may be low, leading to [[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding#Anovulatory DUB|anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding.]]
* During implantation and [[gestation]], progesterone appears to decrease the maternal [[immune system|immune]] response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy.
* Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine [[smooth muscle]].<ref name="colostate"/>
* In addition progesterone inhibits [[lactation]] during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production.
* A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]].

The [[fetus]] [[metabolize]]s placental progesterone in the production of [[adrenal]] steroids.

=== Nervous system ===

Progesterone, like [[pregnenolone]] and [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], belongs to the group of [[neurosteroid]]s. It can be synthesized within the [[central nervous system]] and also serves as a precursor to another major neurosteroid, [[allopregnanolone]].

[[neuroactive steroid|Neurosteroids]] affect [[synapse|synaptic functioning]], are neuroprotective, and affect [[myelin]]ation.<ref name="pmid15135772">{{cite journal | author = Schumacher M, Guennoun R, Robert F, ''et al.'' | title = Local synthesis and dual actions of progesterone in the nervous system: neuroprotection and myelination | journal = Growth Horm.

Progesterone affects regulation of [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] genes.

Its effect as a neurosteroid works predominantly through the [[GSK-3]] beta pathway, as an inhibitor.  (Other GSK-3 beta inhibitors include [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] mood stabilizers, [[lithium]] and [[valproic acid]].)

===Other effects===

* It raises [[epidermal growth factor-1]] levels, a factor often used to induce proliferation, and used to sustain cultures, of [[stem cell]]s.
* It increases core temperature (thermogenic function) during ovulation.<ref name="GeorgiaPhysiology">{{GeorgiaPhysiology|5/5ch9/s5ch9_13}}</ref>
* It reduces [[spasm]] and relaxes [[smooth muscle]]. [[Bronchi]] are widened and [[mucus]] regulated. ([[Progesterone receptor]]s are widely present in [[Mucous membrane|submucosal tissue]].)

== Medical applications ==
[[File:000527lg Prometrium 100 MG Oral Capsule.jpg|right|thumb|Prometrium 100 mg Oral Capsule]]
The use of progesterone and its analogues have many medical applications, both to address acute situations and to address the long-term decline of natural progesterone levels.

=== Bioavailability ===
The route of administration impacts the effect of the drug. Given orally, progesterone has a wide person-to-person variability in absorption and [[bioavailability]] while synthetic progestins are rapidly absorbed with a longer [[half-life]] than progesterone and maintain stable levels in the blood.<ref>{{cite pmid | 14670641 }}</ref>

Progesterone does not dissolve in water and is poorly absorbed when taken orally unless [[Micronization|micronized]] in oil.

=== Other specific uses ===

* Progesterone is used for [[luteal support]] in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) cycles such as In-vitro Fertilization (IVF). 
* Progesterone is used to control persistent [[anovulatory bleeding]]. It is also used to prepare uterine lining in [[infertility]] therapy and to support early pregnancy. Patients with [[habitual abortion|recurrent pregnancy loss]] due to inadequate progesterone production may receive progesterone.
* Progesterone is also used in nonpregnant women with a delayed menstruation of one or more weeks, in order to allow the thickened endometrial lining to slough off.  This process is termed a progesterone withdrawal bleed.  The progesterone is taken orally for a short time (usually one week), after which the progesterone is discontinued and bleeding should occur.{{Citation needed|reason=medroxyprogesterone is normally used for this|date=March 2012}}
* Progesterone is being investigated as potentially beneficial in treating [[multiple sclerosis]], since the characteristic deterioration of nerve [[myelin]] insulation halts during pregnancy, when progesterone levels are raised; deterioration commences again when the levels drop.

== Role in aging ==

Since most progesterone in males is created during testicular production of [[testosterone]], and most in females by the [[ovaries]], the shutting down (whether by natural or chemical means), or removal, of those inevitably causes a considerable reduction in progesterone levels. Previous concentration upon the role of [[progestogen]]s (progesterone and molecules with similar effects) in female reproduction, when progesterone was simply considered a "female hormone", obscured the significance of progesterone elsewhere in both sexes.

The tendency for progesterone to have a regulatory effect, the presence of progesterone [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s in many types of body tissue, and the pattern of deterioration (or [[tumor]] formation) in many of those increasing in later years when progesterone levels have dropped, is prompting widespread research into the potential value of maintaining progesterone levels in both males and females.

== Role in brain damage ==

Studies as far back as 1987 show that female sex hormones have an effect on the recovery of traumatic brain injury.<ref name="pmid22088981">{{cite journal |author=Espinoza TR, Wright DW |title=The role of progesterone in traumatic brain injury |journal=J Head Trauma Rehabil |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=497–9 |year=2011 |pmid=22088981 |doi=10.1097/HTR.0b013e31823088fa |url=}}</ref> In these studies, it was first observed that pseudopregnant female rats had reduced edema after traumatic brain injury. Recent clinical trials have shown that among patients that have suffered moderate traumatic brain injury, those that have been treated with progesterone are more likely to have a better outcome than those who have not.<ref name="pmid21497181"/>

Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to [[traumatic brain injury]] and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of [[estrogen]] and progesterone in females.<ref name="pmid10833057">{{cite journal | author = Roof RL, Hall ED | title = Gender differences in acute CNS trauma and stroke: neuroprotective effects of estrogen and progesterone | journal = J.

=== Proposed mechanism ===

The mechanism of progesterone protective effects may be the reduction of inflammation that follows brain trauma.<ref name="pmid18188998">{{cite journal | author = Pan DS, Liu WG, Yang XF, Cao F | title = Inhibitory effect of progesterone on inflammatory factors after experimental traumatic brain injury | journal = Biomed.

Damage incurred by traumatic brain injury is believed to be caused in part by mass [[depolarization]] leading to [[excitotoxicity]]. One way in which progesterone helps to alleviate some of this excitotoxicity is by blocking the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s that trigger [[neurotransmitter]] release.<ref name="pmid22101209">{{cite journal | author = Luoma JI, Stern CM, Mermelstein PG | title = Progesterone inhibition of neuronal calcium signaling underlies aspects of progesterone-mediated neuroprotection | journal = J.

Another method for reducing the excitotoxicity is by up-regulating the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, [[GABAA]].<ref name="pmcid2699575">{{cite journal |author=Stein DG |title=Progesterone exerts neuroprotective effects after brain injury |journal=Brain Res Rev |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=386–97 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=17826842 |pmc=2699575 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.06.012 |url=}}</ref>

Progesterone has also been shown to prevent [[apoptosis]] in neurons, a common consequence of brain injury.<ref name="pmid22088981"/> It does so by inhibiting enzymes involved in the apoptosis pathway specifically concerning the mitochondria, such as activated [[caspase 3]] and [[cytochrome c]]. 

Not only does progesterone help prevent further damage, it has also been shown to aid in [[neuroregeneration]]. One of the serious effects of traumatic brain injury includes edema.

=== Combination treatments ===

[[Vitamin D]] and progesterone separately have neuroprotective effects after traumatic brain injury, but when combined their effects are [[synergistic]].<ref name="pmid19394357">{{cite journal |author=Cekic M, Sayeed I, Stein DG |title=Combination treatment with progesterone and vitamin D hormone may be more effective than monotherapy for nervous system injury and disease |journal=Front Neuroendocrinol |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=158–72 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19394357 |pmc=3025702 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2009.04.002 |url=}}</ref>  When used at their optimal respective concentrations, the two combined have been shown to reduce cell death more than when alone.

Both progesterone and estrogen are known to have antioxidant-like qualities and are shown to reduce edema without injuring the blood-brain barrier. In this study, when the two hormones are administered alone it does reduce edema, but the combination of the two increases the water content, thereby increasing edema.<ref name="pmid21186375">{{cite journal | author = Khaksari M, Soltani Z, Shahrokhi N, Moshtaghi G, Asadikaram G | title = The role of estrogen and progesterone, administered alone and in combination, in modulating cytokine concentration following traumatic brain injury | journal = Can.

===Clinical trials===
The clinical trials for progesterone as a treatment for traumatic brain injury have only recently begun. ProTECT, a phase II trial conducted in Atlanta at Grady Memorial Hospital in 2007, the first to show that progesterone reduces edema in humans. Since then, trials have moved on to phase III. The National Institute of Health began conducting a nationwide phase III trial in 2011 led by Emory University.<ref name="pmid21497181">{{cite journal|author=Stein DG|title=Progesterone in the treatment of acute traumatic brain injury: a clinical perspective and update|journal=Neuroscience|volume=191|issue=| pages=101–6|year=2011|month=September|pmid=21497181|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.04.013 }}</ref> A global phase III initiative called SyNAPSe®, initiated in June 2010, is run by a U.S.-based private pharmaceutical company, BHR Pharma, and is being conducted in the United States, Argentina, Europe, Israel and Asia.<ref name="ClinicalTrials.gov_ SyNAPSe">{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01143064?term=syNAPSe&rank=1|title=Efficacy and Safety Study of Intravenous Progesterone in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (SyNAPSe)|work=ClinicalTrials.gov|publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health| accessdate=2012-07-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SyNAPse: The Global phase 3 study of progesterone in severe traumatic brain injury|url=http://www.synapse-trial.com/|publisher=BHR Pharma, LLC }}</ref> Approximately 1,200 patients with severe (Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3-8), closed-head TBI will be enrolled in the study at nearly 150 medical centers.
