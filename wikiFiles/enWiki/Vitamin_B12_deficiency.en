'''Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency''' or '''hypocobalaminemia''' is a low blood level of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. It can cause permanent damage to [[nervous tissue]] if left untreated longer than 6 months.<ref>https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000574.htm</ref>  [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] itself was discovered through investigation of [[pernicious anemia]], which is an [[autoimmune disease]] that destroys [[parietal cell]]s in the stomach that secrete [[intrinsic factor]]. Pernicious anemia, if left untreated, is usually fatal within three years.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Once identified, however, the condition can be treated successfully and with relative ease, although it cannot be cured and ongoing treatment is required. Humans obtain almost all of their vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from dietary means. [[Pernicious anemia]] is usually the result of insufficient secretion of intrinsic factor within the stomach.<ref name="Voet, Donald ; Voet, Judith G. 2010 957">{{Cite book|author=Voet, Donald ; Voet, Judith G. |title=Biochemistry |publisher=J. Wiley & Sons |location=New York |year=2010 |page=957 |isbn=978-0470-57095-1}}</ref> Other more subtle types of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency have been elucidated, including the [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] effects, over the course of time in significant numbers.

The results of the [[Framingham Heart Study|Framingham Offspring Study]] indicate that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may be more common than was previously believed. Deficiency is most significantly linked to improper absorption rather than low consumption, as many who consume high amounts of B<sub>12</sub> may still experience deficiency.<ref>{{cite web|title=B12 Deficiency May Be More Widespread Than Thought|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2000/000802.htm|work=Agricultural Research Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 July 2012|author=Judy McBride|date=2|month=August|year=2000}}</ref>

==Storage and levels==
The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in the body is between two and five&nbsp;mg in adults. Approximately 50% is stored in the [[liver]], but approximately 0.1% is lost each day, due to secretions into the gut—not all of the vitamin in the gut is reabsorbed. While [[bile]] is the main vehicle for B<sub>12</sub> excretion, most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Due to the extreme efficiency of this mechanism, the liver can store three to five years worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> under normal conditions and functioning.<ref name="Voet, Donald ; Voet, Judith G. 2010 957"/> However, the rate at which B<sub>12</sub> levels may change when dietary intake is low depends on the balance between several variables:

== Symptoms and pathomorphology ==
Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency has the following pathomorphology, signs, and symptoms:<ref>Anatol Dowżenko ''Clinical Neurology'' ISBN 83-200-1197-3, p. 451</ref>

===Metabolic===
Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes particular changes to the metabolism of 2 clinically relevant substances in humans:
# [[Homocysteine]] (homocysteine to methionine, catalysed by methionine synthase) leading to hyperhomocysteinemia;
# [[Methylmalonic acid]] (methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, of which methylmalonyl-CoA is made from methylmalonic acid in a preceding reaction)
Methionine is activated to [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]], which aids in purine and thymidine synthesis, myelin production, protein/neurotransmitters/fatty acid/phospholipid production and DNA methylation. [[5-Methyl tetrahydrofolate]] provides a methyl group, which is released to the reaction with homocysteine, resulting in methionine. This reaction requires cobalamin as a cofactor. The creation of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate is an irreversible reaction. If B<sub>12</sub> is absent, the forward reaction of homocysteine to methionine does not occur, and the replenishment of tetrahydrofolate stops.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Vitamin B12-Folate Interrelationships | author=B, Shane | journal=Ann. Rev. Nutr | year=1985 | volume=5 | pages=115–41 | doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.05.070185.000555 | last2=Stokstad | first2=E L R}}</ref>

Because B<sub>12</sub> and folate are involved in the [[metabolism]] of homocysteine, hyperhomocysteinuria is a non-specific marker of deficiency. Methylmalonic acid is used as a more specific test of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

===Pathomorphology===
A [[spongiform state]] of neural tissue along with [[edema]] of fibers and deficiency of tissue. The [[myelin]] decays, along with axial fiber. In later phases, fibric [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] of nervous tissues occurs. Those changes apply to dorsal parts of the spinal cord and to pyramidal tracts in lateral cords. The pathophysiologic state of the spinal cord is called [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vitamin B12 / Pathophysiology Text|url=http://www.lifesave.org/VitaminB12Pathophysiology215-216.htm|publisher=LifeSave.org|page=215}}</ref>

In the brain itself, changes are less severe: They occur as small sources of nervous fibers decay and accumulation of <!-- astrocyty tuczne --> [[astrocyte]]s, usually subcortically located, and also round hemorrhages with a torus of glial cells. Pathological changes can be noticed as well in the posterior roots of the cord and, to lesser extent, in peripheral nerves.

===Clinical symptoms===
The main syndrome of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is Biermer's disease ([[pernicious anemia]]). It is characterized by a triad of symptoms:
#[[Anemia]] with bone marrow promegaloblastosis ([[megaloblastic anemia]]). This is due to the inhibition of DNA synthesis (specifically purines and thymidine)
#Gastrointestinal symptoms.{{specify|date=December 2012}} These are thought to be due to defective DNA synthesis inhibiting replication in a site with a high turnover of cells. This may also be due to the autoimmune attack on the parietal cells of the stomach in pernicious anemia. There is an association with [[Gastric antral vascular ectasia|GAVE syndrome]] (commonly called watermelon stomach) and pernicious anemia.<ref>"Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia Syndrome", DN Amarapurka MD and ND Patel MD ''Journal of The Association of Physcians of India'', Vol. 52 Sept. 2004, p.757.</ref>
#Neurological symptoms: Sensory or motor deficiencies (absent reflexes, diminished vibration or soft touch sensation), [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]], or even symptoms of dementia and or other psychiatric symptoms may be present. The presence of peripheral sensory-motor symptoms or subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord strongly suggests the presence of a B<sub>12</sub> deficiency instead of folate deficiency. Methylmalonic acid, if not properly handled by B<sub>12</sub>, remains in the myelin sheath, causing fragility. Dementia and depression have been associated with this deficiency as well, possibly from the under production of [[methionine]] because of the inability to convert homocysteine into this product. Methionine is a precursor to multiple [[neurotransmitters]].

Each of those symptoms can occur either alone or along with others. The neurological complex, defined as ''[[myelosis funicularis]]'', consists of the following symptoms:
#Impaired perception of deep touch, pressure and vibration, abolishment of sense of touch, very annoying and persistent [[paresthesia]]s
#[[Ataxia]] of dorsal cord type
#Decrease or abolishment of deep muscle-tendon reflexes <!--3)fluffy muscle tension; (wiotkie napiecie miesniowe) -->
#Pathological reflexes &mdash; [[Babinski]], [[Rossolimo's sign|Rossolimo]] and others, also severe [[paresis]]

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency can cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system. These symptoms of neuronal damage may not reverse after correction of hematological abnormalities, and the chance of complete reversal decreases with the length of time the neurological symptoms have been present.

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency symptoms also include shortness of breath and increased pallor.

== Psychological symptoms and mental disorders ==

At levels only slightly lower than normal, a range of symptoms such as [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and poor [[memory]] may be experienced.<ref name=nih>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitaminb12.asp Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin B12]</ref> However, these symptoms by themselves are too nonspecific to diagnose deficiency of the vitamin.

Vitamin '''B<sub>12</sub>''' deficiency can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis, fatigue, memory impairment, irritability, depression and personality changes.<ref name="ijnwvitaminb12">{{Cite journal|author=Sethi NK, Robilotti E, Sadan Y |title=Neurological Manifestations Of Vitamin B-12 Deficiency |journal=The Internet Journal of Nutrition and Wellness |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2005 |url=http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlPrinter=true&xmlFilePath=journals/ijnw/vol2n1/vitaminb12.xml}}</ref><ref name="imajvitaminb12">{{Cite journal|author=Masalha R, Chudakov B, Muhamad M, Rudoy I, Volkov I, Wirguin I|title=Cobalamin-responsive psychosis as the sole manifestation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency|journal=Israeli Medical Association Journal|volume=3|year=2001|pages=701–703|doi=}}</ref><ref name="ijnwvitaminb12">{{Cite journal| author=Sethi NK, Robilotti E, Sadan Y | title=Neurological Manifestations Of Vitamin B-12 Deficiency | journal=The Internet Journal of Nutrition and Wellness | volume=2 | issue=1 | year=2005 | doi=}}</ref><ref name="nlm.nih.gov">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000569.htm</ref><ref name="imajvitaminb12">{{Cite journal|author=Masalha R, Chudakov B, Muhamad M, Rudoy I, Volkov I, Wirguin I |title=Cobalamin-responsive psychosis as the sole manifestation of vitamin B12 deficiency |journal=Isr.

== Association of low B<sub>12</sub> with diseases not classically due to vitamin deficiency ==

A number of diseases not classically thought to be caused by B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are epidemiologically associated with it, raising questions of whether B<sub>12</sub> status is an independent risk-factor, or a partial causal agent in these states. None of these causal connections have been proved, and all are under active investigation.

B<sub>12</sub> status may be associated with the onset and cause of [[Alzheimer's disease]].

==Causes==
* Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> occurs in animal products (eggs, meat, milk) as well as in some algae, such as ''[[Chlorella]]''<ref name="Kittaka-Katsura H 2002">Kittaka-Katsura H, et al.

PMID 16267554</ref> Vegans and vegetarians to a lesser degree may be at risk for B<sub>12</sub> deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake of B<sub>12</sub>, since they may not be aware of the few non-animal dietary sources of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. However a 2000 Tuft study found not eating meat was not correlated with lower levels.<ref name="2000 study"/> Children are at a higher risk for B<sub>12</sub> deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake, as they have fewer vitamin stores and a relatively larger vitamin need per calorie of food intake. 

* Selective impaired absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> due to [[intrinsic factor]] deficiency. This may be caused by the loss of [[stomach|gastric]] [[parietal cells]] in chronic [[atrophic gastritis]] (in which case, the resulting [[megaloblastic anemia]] takes the name of "[[pernicious anemia]]"), or may result from wide surgical resection of stomach (for any reason), or from rare hereditary causes of impaired synthesis of intrinsic factor.

* Impaired absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in the setting of a more generalized [[malabsorption]] or maldigestion syndrome. This includes any form of structural damage or wide surgical resection of the terminal [[ileum]] (the principal site of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption).

* Forms of [[achlorhydria]] (including that artificially induced by drugs such as [[proton pump inhibitors]]) can cause B<sub>12</sub> malabsorption from foods, since acid is needed to split B<sub>12</sub> from food proteins and salivary binding proteins. This process is thought to be the most common cause of low B<sub>12</sub> in the elderly, who often have some degree of achlorhydria without being formally low in [[intrinsic factor]]. This process does not affect absorption of small amounts of B<sub>12</sub> in supplements such as multivitamins, since it is not bound to proteins, as is the B<sub>12</sub> in foods.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

* Surgical removal of the small bowel (for example in [[Crohn's disease]]) such that the patient presents with [[short bowel syndrome]] and is unable to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. This can be treated with regular injections of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.

* Long-term use of [[ranitidine]] hydrochloride may contribute to deficiency of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Yeomans ND, Hanson RG, Smallwood RA et al. | title = Effect of chronic ranitidine treatment on secretion of intrinsic factor. |journal = BMJ | year = 1982 | pages = 285-264 }}</ref>

* [[Coeliac disease]] may also cause impaired absorption of this vitamin, though this is due not to loss of intrinsic factor, but rather damage to the small bowel.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

* Some [[bariatric surgery|bariatric surgical procedures]], especially those that involve removal of part of the stomach, such as [[Roux-en-Y]] [[gastric bypass]] surgery. (Procedures such as the [[adjustable gastric band]] type do not appear to affect B<sub>12</sub> metabolism significantly).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

* [[Bacterial overgrowth]] in parts of the small bowel are thought to be able to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. An example occurs in so-called [[blind loop syndrome]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

* The [[diabetes]] medication [[metformin]] may interfere with B<sub>12</sub> dietary absorption.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Ting R, Szeto C, Chan M, Ma K, Chow K | title = Risk factors of vitamin B(12) deficiency in patients receiving metformin | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 166 | issue = 18 | pages = 1975–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17030830 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.166.18.1975}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Blood serum|Serum]] B<sub>12</sub> levels are often low in B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, but if other features of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are present with normal B<sub>12</sub> then further investigation is warranted. One possible explanation for normal B<sub>12</sub> levels in B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is antibody interference in people with high titres of [[intrinsic factor antibody]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hamilton MS, Blackmore S, Lee A |title=Possible cause of false normal B-12 assays |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7569 |pages=654–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16990334 |pmc=1570871 |doi=10.1136/bmj.333.7569.654-c |url=}}</ref>
Some researchers propose that the current standard norms of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels are too low.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Goodman M, Chen XH, Darwish D |title=Are US lower normal B 12 limits too low? [Letter] |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=44|issue=10 |pages=1274–5 |year=1996|pmid=8856015 }}</ref>
In Japan, the lowest acceptable level for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in blood has been raised from about 200 pg/mL (145 [[Molar concentration|pM]]) to 550 pg/mL (400 pM).<ref name=Mitsuyama/>

Serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> tests results are in pg/mL ([[Pico-|picograms]]/millilitre) or pmol/L (pico[[mole (unit)|mole]]s/litre). The laboratory reference ranges for these units are similar, since the molecular weight of B<sub>12</sub> is approximately 1000, the difference between mL and L. Thus: 550 pg/mL = 400 pmol/L.

Serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are considered more reliable indicators of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency than the concentration of B<sub>12</sub> in blood.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news-medical.net/?id=5908 |title=Test used to diagnose B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may be inadequate |date=October 28, 2004 |publisher=news-medical.net |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> The levels of these substances are high in B<sub>12</sub> deficiency and can be helpful if the diagnosis is unclear. Approximately 10% of patients with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels between 200–400pg/l will have a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency on the basis of elevated levels of [[homocysteine]] and [[methylmalonic acid]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Routine monitoring of [[methylmalonic acid]] levels in urine is an option for people who may not be getting enough dietary B<sub>12</sub>, as a rise in [[methylmalonic acid]] levels may be an early indication of deficiency.<ref name="donaldson">{{Cite journal|author=Donaldson MS |title=Metabolic vitamin B<sub>12</sub> status on a mostly raw vegan diet with follow-up using tablets, nutritional yeast, or probiotic supplements |journal=Ann.

[[File:Hydroxocobalamin Injection.jpg|thumb|300px|Hydroxocobalamin injection USP (1000 mcg/mL) is a clear red liquid solution of hydoxocobalamin which is available in a 30 mL brown glass multidose vial packaged in a paper box. Shown is 500 mcg B-12 (as 1/2 cc) drawn up in a 1/2 cc U-100 27 gauge x 1/2" insulin syringe, as prepared for subcutaneous injection.]]
B<sub>12</sub> can be supplemented in healthy subjects by oral pill; [[sublingual]] pill, liquid, or strip; intranasal spray; [[Transdermal patch|transdermal]] patch or by injection. B<sub>12</sub> is available singly or in combination with other supplements. B<sub>12</sub> supplements are available in forms including [[cyanocobalamin]], [[hydroxocobalamin]], [[methylcobalamin]], and [[adenosylcobalamin]] (sometimes called "cobamamide" or "dibencozide"). Oral treatments involve giving 250&nbsp;µg to 1&nbsp;mg of B<sub>12</sub> daily.<ref name="AHRF">[http://www.american-hearing.org/disorders/central/b12.html#treated American Hearing Research Foundation] Chicago, Illinois 2008</ref>

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be given as intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of [[hydroxycobalamin]], [[methylcobalamin]], or [[cyanocobalamin]]. Body stores (in the liver) are partly repleted with half a dozen injections in the first couple of weeks (full repletion of liver stores requires about 20 injections) and then maintenance with monthly injections throughout the life of the patient. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can also be easily self-administered by injection by the patient, using the same fine-gauge needles and syringes used for self-administration of [[insulin]].

B<sub>12</sub> has traditionally been given [[parenterally]] (by injection) to ensure absorption. However, oral replacement is now an accepted route, as it has become increasingly appreciated that sufficient quantities of B<sub>12</sub> are absorbed when large doses are given.

[[Hypokalemia]], an excessively low [[potassium]] level in the [[blood]], is anecdotally reported as a complication of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> repletion after deficiency. Excessive quantities of [[potassium]] are used by newly growing and dividing [[hematopoietic]] cells, depleting circulating stores of the [[mineral]].

Research has established the effectiveness of other routes of B<sub>12</sub> administration, primarily intranasal and sublingual dosing, but neither has been proven to be superior to oral dosing; recommendations are based on a consumers individual circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vitamin B12 Supplement Options What are the Options in Vitamin B12 Supplements?|url=http://b12vitamininjections.com/365/vitamin-b12-supplements-explained/|work=Vitamin B12 Resource|publisher=B 12 Vitamin Injections|accessdate=2 July 2012|author=Vitamin B12 Resource|year=2012}}</ref> The sublingual route, in which B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed under the tongue, is manufactured in a variety of forms, such as lozenges, pills, and lollipops.

Sublingual methods of replacement may be effective only because of the typically high doses (500 micrograms), which are swallowed, not because of placement of the tablet. As noted below, such very high doses of oral B<sub>12</sub> may be effective as treatments, even if [[gastro-intestinal tract]] absorption is impaired by gastric atrophy (pernicious anemia).

==Dietary sources==

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be found in large quantities in animal products, including meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, and dairy products; and the consumption of these products is the most longstanding method by which human beings have taken vitamin B<sub>12</sub> into their systems. Bioavailability of B<sub>12</sub> in eggs is low (<9%) compared to other animal food sources.<ref name="pmid17959839">{{cite journal |author=Watanabe F |title=Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability |journal=Exp.

== Fermented foods and unconventional bacterial sources ==

Since B<sub>12</sub> is produced by bacteria, it is possible that it can be obtained in some bacterially fermented foods such as traditional Korean foods. However, this has not yet be rigorously proven.<ref>Kwak C S, et al. (2010) "Dietary source of vitamin B(12) intake and vitamin B(12) status in female elderly Koreans aged 85 and older living in rural area." ''Nutr Res Pract.'' '''4''' (3): 229-34. PMID 20607069</ref><ref>Kwak C S, et al. (2010) "Discovery of Novel Sources of Vitamin B12 in Traditional Korean Foods from Nutritional Surveys of Centenarians." ''Curr Gerontol Res.'' (374897). PMID 21436999 doi:10.1155/2010/374897</ref> 

Certain makers of [[kombucha]] cultured tea, such as GT's Kombucha, list vitamin B<sub>12</sub> as naturally present in their product. One brand purports to contain 20 percent of the Daily Value of B<sub>12</sub> in a single bottle,<ref>http://www.synergydrinks.com/enlightened/kombucha_enlightened_gingerade.aspx</ref> making kombucha a potential "high" food source of B<sub>12</sub>. Because kombucha is produced by a symbiosis between yeast and bacteria, the possibility that kombucha contains B<sub>12</sub> does not contradict current knowledge. But no scientific studies have yet been published confirming the fact, nor whether the B<sub>12</sub> in kombucha is the biologically active B<sub>12</sub>.

A Japanese fermented black tea known as Batabata-cha has been found to contain biologically active B<sub>12</sub>.<ref>Kittaka-Katsura H, et al. (2004) "Characterization of corrinoid compounds from a Japanese black tea (Batabata-cha) fermented by bacteria." ''J  Agric Food Chem'' '''52''' (4): 909-11. PMID 14969549</ref> Unlike kombucha which is made by fermenting already prepared tea, Batabata-cha is fermented while still in the tea leaf state.

Unconventional natural sources of B<sub>12</sub> also exist, but their utility as food sources of B<sub>12</sub> are doubtful. For example, plants pulled from the ground and not washed scrupulously may contain remnants of B<sub>12</sub> from the bacteria present in the surrounding soil.<ref name=AJCN>{{cite web|last=Herbert|first=Victor|title=Clinical Nutrition|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/48/3/852.full.pdf+html|publisher=American Journal of clinical Nutrition|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref> B<sub>12</sub> is also found in lakes if the water has not been sanitized.<ref name=oslo>{{cite web|title=MONTHLY SURVEY OF VITAMIN B,, CONCENTRATIONS IN SOME WATERS OF THE ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT|url=http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_14/issue_2/0224.pdf|publisher=Unit for Biochemical Research Bearing on Fisheries’ Problems, National Institute for Research in Dairying, Shinfield, Reading, England|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref> Certain [[insects]] such as [[termites]] contain B<sub>12</sub> produced by their gut bacteria, in a way analogous to ruminant animals.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Wakayama EJ, Dillwith JW, Howard RW, Blomquist GJ| title= Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels in selected insects| journal= Insect Biochemistry| year= 1984| volume= 14| pages= 175–179| doi= 10.1016/0020-1790(84)90027-1|issue= 2}}</ref> The human intestinal tract itself may contain B<sub>12</sub> producing bacteria in the small intestine,<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Albert MJ, Mathan VI, Baker SJ| title= Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> synthesis by human small intestinal bacteria| journal= INature| year= 1980| volume= 283| pages= 781–782| doi= 10.1038/283781a0|issue= 5749}}</ref> but it is unclear whether sufficient amounts of the vitamin could be produced to meet nutritional needs.

== Fortified sources ==
Foods [[Food fortification|fortified]] with B<sub>12</sub> are also sources of the vitamin although they cannot be regarded as true food sources of B<sub>12</sub> since the vitamin is added in supplement form, from commercial bacterial production sources, such as cyanocobalamin.  Examples of B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods include fortified [[breakfast cereals]], fortified [[soybean|soy]] products, fortified [[energy bar]]s, and fortified [[nutritional yeast]].  The  UK [[Vegan Society]], the Vegetarian Resource Group, and the [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]], among others, deny that non-animal food sources of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are reliable and recommend that every vegan who is not supplementing consume B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vegan Society B<sub>12</sub>factsheet|url=http://www.vegansociety.com/food/nutrition/b12/|last=Walsh|first=Stephen, RD|publisher=Vegan Society|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref><ref name="vrg.org"/><ref name="B12PCRM"/> Not all of these may contain labeled amounts of vitamin activity. Supplemental B<sub>12</sub> added to beverages in one study was found to degrade to contain varying levels of pseudovitamin-B<sub>12</sub>.  One report has found B<sub>12</sub> analogues present in varying amounts in some multivitamins.<ref name="Yamada K 2008"/><ref>Herbert V, et al. (1982) "Multivitamin/mineral food supplements containing vitamin B12 may also contain analogues of vitamin B12." ''New England Journal of Medicine'' '''307''' (4): 255-6. PMID 7088084</ref>

== Pseudovitamin sources ==

So-called pseudovitamin-B<sub>12</sub> refers to B<sub>12</sub>-like analogues that are biologically inactive in humans and yet found to be present alongside B<sub>12</sub> in humans,<ref>Kanazawa S, et al.

== Controversial sources in algae with some evidence ==

The UK [[Vegan Society]], the Vegetarian Resource Group, and the [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]], among others, recommend that vegans either consistently eat B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods or take a daily or weekly B<sub>12</sub> supplement to meet the recommended intake.<ref name="vrg.org">cite web|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/b12.htm |title=Vitamin B12 in the Vegan Diet |accessdate=2008-01-17|author=[[Reed Mangels]], Ph.D., R.D. |publisher=Vegetarian Resource Group</ref><ref name="B12PCRM">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/b12.html |title=Don't Vegetarians Have Trouble Getting Enough Vitamin B12? |accessdate=2008-01-17 |publisher=[[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegansociety.com/html/food/nutrition/b12/index.php |title=What every vegan should know about vitamin B12 |accessdate=2007-12-03 |author=Stephen Walsh |publisher=Vegan Society |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070717005001/http://www.vegansociety.com/html/food/nutrition/b12/index.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-07-17}}</ref>

It is important for vegans, who possess limited food sources of B<sub>12</sub>, and anyone else wishing to obtain B<sub>12</sub> from food sources other than animals, to consume foods that contain little or no pseudovitamin-B<sub>12</sub> and are high in biologically active B<sub>12</sub>. However, there have been no significant human trials<!-- one trial reported on a *single person* normalizing MMA levels with Chlorella--> of sufficient size to demonstrate enzymatic activity of B<sub>12</sub> from nonbacterial sources, such as ''[[Chlorella]]'' and edible sea algae (seaweeds, such as lavers), although chemically some of these sources have been reported to contain B<sub>12</sub> that seems chemically identical to active vitamin.<ref name="Kittaka-Katsura H 2002">Kittaka-Katsura H, et al. (2002) "Purification and characterization of a corrinoid compound from Chlorella tablets as an algal health food." ''J Agric Food Chem.'' '''50''' (17): 4994-7. PMID 12166996</ref><ref name="Watanabe F 2002"/> However, among these sources, only fresh sea algea such as Susabi-nori (''[[Porphyra]] yezoensis'')<ref name="Watanabe F 2000">Watanabe F, et al. (2000) "Characterization of vitamin B12 compound in the edible purple laver, Porphyra yezoensis." ''Biosci Biotechnol Biochem.'' '''64''' (12): 2712/5.

'''85''' (6): 699-703. PMID 11430774</ref> have been reported to demonstrated vitamin B<sub>12</sub> activity in B<sub>12</sub> deficient rats. This has yet to be demonstrated for ''[[Chlorella]]'', and no study in rats of any algal B<sub>12</sub> source has yet to be confirmed by a second independent study. The possibility of algae-derived active forms of B<sub>12</sub> presently remains an active topic of research, with no results that have yet reached consensus in the nutritional community.

==Epidemiology==
A study in the year 2000 indicates that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is far more widespread than formerly believed. The study found that 39 percent of studied group of 3,000 had low values.<ref name="2000 study">{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2000/000802.htm |title=B12 Deficiency May Be More Widespread Than Thought / August 2, 2000 / News from the USDA Agricultural Research Service |accessdate=2007-07-01 |work=}}</ref> This study at [[Tufts University]] used the B<sub>12</sub> concentration 258 pmol/l (= 350 pg/mL) as a criterion of "low level". However, a recent research<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Donald|publisher=Xlibris|isbn=978-1-4628-8427-8|page=41}}</ref> has found that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may occur at a much higher B<sub>12</sub> concentration (500–600 pg/mL). On this basis Mitsuyama and Kogoh<ref name=Mitsuyama>{{Cite journal|author=Mitsuyama Y, Kogoh H |title=Serum and cerebrospinal fluid vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels in demented patients with CH3-B<sub>12</sub> treatment--preliminary study |journal=Jpn. J. Psychiatry Neurol. |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=65–71 |year=1988 |pmid=3398357 |doi= 10.1111/j.1440-1819.1988.tb01957.x|url=}}</ref> proposed 550 pg/mL, and Tiggelen et al.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=VanTiggelen CJM, Peperkamp JPC, TerToolen JFW. | journal=Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry | year=1983 | title=Vitamin-B12 levels of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with organic mental disorder | pages=305–11 | volume= | issue=12 }}</ref> proposed 600 pg/mL. Against this background, there are reasons to believe that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is present in a far greater proportion of the population than 39% as reported by Tufts University.

In the developing world the deficiency is very widespread, with significant levels of deficiency in Africa, India, and South and Central America. This is theorized to be due to low intakes of animal products, particularly among the poor,<ref name="Baik HW, Russell RM 1999 357–77">{{Cite journal|author=Baik HW, Russell RM |title=Vitamin B12 deficiency in the elderly |journal=Annu. Rev. Nutr. |volume=19 |issue= |pages=357–77 |year=1999 |pmid=10448529 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.357 |url=}}</ref> though data from WHO publications on world food consumption point to a large deficiency of poor populations in consuming adequate amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables, which carry B<sub>12</sub> from bacteria in the soil they are grown in, so this is likely a primary cause as well, since vitamin B<sub>12</sub> does not originate from animal sources and can be obtained without consuming animal products.<ref>{{cite web|title=Availability and consumption of fish|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/3_foodconsumption/en/index5.html|work=3. Global and regional food consumption patterns and trends|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2 July 2012|author=World Health Organization|year=2012}}</ref>

B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is more common in the elderly.<ref name="Baik HW, Russell RM 1999 357–77"/> This is because B<sub>12</sub> absorption decreases greatly in the presence of [[atrophic gastritis]], which is common in the elderly.

A 1982 American study found that among 83 volunteer subjects, 92% of the vegans, 64% of the lactovegetarians, 47% of the lacto-ovovegetarians, and 20% of the semivegetarians had serum B<sub>12</sub> levels less than 200 pg/ml. "However," the researchers said, "their complete blood count values did not deviate greatly from those found for nonvegetarians, even though  some had been vegans or lactovegetarians for over 10 years. Macrocytosis among the vegetarians was minimal; none had a mean corpuscular volume greater than 103 fl."<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Dong A, Scott SC |title=Serum vitamin B12 and blood cell values in vegetarians |journal=Ann.

The 2000 [[Tufts University]] study found no correlation between eating meat and differences in B<sub>12</sub> serum levels.<ref name="2000 study"/>

==Masking effect of folic acid==
The [[National Institutes of Health]] has found that "Large amounts of [[folic acid]] can mask the damaging effects of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency by correcting the megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency without correcting the neurological damage that also occurs", there are also indications that "high serum folate levels might not only mask vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, but could also exacerbate the anemia and worsen the cognitive symptoms associated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency".<ref name="NIH">{{cite web|title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet:Vitamin B12|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitaminb12/|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref> Due to the fact that in the United States legislation has required enriched flour to contain folic acid to reduce cases of fetal neural-tube defects, consumers may be ingesting more than they realize.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=January 18, 2011|title=Sluggish?
