In 2008, the late David Guymon (former CEO of Manatee Palms) was awarded the TRAUMA Champion Award by the [[University of South Florida|University of South Florida's]] Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute, recognizing his "commitment to trauma informed care".<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/society-social/families-children-family/11667360-1.html "Psychiatric Solutions Announces TRAUMA Champion..."]. "''AllBusiness.com''". Retrieved 2010-05-16.|{{accessdate=9 October 2012}} {{Dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>  Mr. Guymon is credited with revitalizing Manatee Palms by implementing a plan of correction which allowed the facility to resume admissions while providing improved patient care.  Following the recognition of Mr. Guymon's restorative guidance at Manatee Palms, he returned to Utah to receive care for advanced ALS-related symptoms.  "Mr. Dave," as he was affectionately referred to by clients, passed away September 29, 2008 where those that admired him are sure he received a special skybox seat to witness his beloved University of Utah Utes dismantle the Alabama Crimson Tide in the Sugar Bowl.
