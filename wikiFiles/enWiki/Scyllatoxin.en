'''Scyllatoxin ''' (also '''leiurotoxin I''') is a [[toxin]], from the [[scorpion]] ''[[Deathstalker|Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus]]'', which blocks small-conductance [[Ca2+-activated K+ channel|Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel]]s.

== Source ==
Scyllatoxin is one of the components of the [[venom]] of the Israeli [[scorpion]] ''‘Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus’''. It consists of only 0.02% of the total protein in crude venom.<ref name="Zhu">{{cite journal |author=Zhu Q, Liang S, Martin L, Gasparini S, Ménez A, Vita C |title=Role of disulfide bonds in folding and activity of leiurotoxin I: just two disulfides suffice |journal=Biochemistry |volume=41 |issue=38 |pages=11488–94 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12234192 |doi=10.1021/bi026136m}}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
Leiurotoxin I is a 31-residue peptide, with a [[helix]] and a short [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] [[β-sheet]]. This toxin is stabilized by [[disulfide bonds]]: Cys8-Cys26 and Cys12-Cys28 is bound to the β-sheet, Cys3-Cys21 is bound to an N-terminal segment preceding the helix. Leiurotoxin adopts the ά/β motif.<ref name="Zhu"/> Especially the positively charged residues (Arg6 and Arg13, which are located in the ά helix) are important for the expression of toxin biological activities<ref name="Sabatier">{{cite journal |author=Sabatier JM, Lecomte C, Mabrouk K, ''et al.'' |title=Synthesis and characterization of leiurotoxin I analogs lacking one disulfide bridge: evidence that disulfide pairing 3-21 is not required for full toxin activity |journal=Biochemistry |volume=35 |issue=33 |pages=10641–7 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8718853 |doi=10.1021/bi960533d10.1021/bi960533d}}</ref> and for its receptor affinity.<ref name="Buisine">{{cite journal |author=Buisine E, Wieruszeski JM, Lippens G, Wouters D, Tartar A, Sautiere P |title=Characterization of a new family of toxin-like peptides from the venom of the scorpion ''Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus''. 1H-NMR structure of leiuropeptide II |journal=J.

== Target ==
Scyllatoxin is a blocker of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>– activated K<sup>+</sup> channels at 10-13–10-11 M concentrations in various cell types.<ref name="Zhu"/>
This toxin shows similarity in its physiological activity and binding specificity to [[apamin]],<ref name="Zhu"/> but both toxins show no structural similarity.<ref name="Chicchi">{{cite journal |author=Chicchi GG, Gimenez-Gallego G, Ber E, Garcia ML, Winquist R, Cascieri MA |title=Purification and characterization of a unique, potent inhibitor of apamin binding from ''Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus'' venom |journal=J.

== Mode of action ==
Scyllatoxin blocks the slow after-[[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] that follows an [[action potential]] in some [[nerve cells]].<ref name="Zhu"/>

== Toxicity ==
Scyllatoxin induces spontaneous contractions in [[guinea pig]] taenia coli muscle cells that have
