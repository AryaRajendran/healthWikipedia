'''Salt''', also known as '''table salt''' or '''rock salt''' ([[halite]]), is a [[crystalline]] [[mineral]] that is composed primarily of [[sodium chloride]] ([[NaCl]]), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of [[Salt (chemistry)|ionic salts]]. It is absolutely essential for [[animal]] life, but can be harmful to animals and plants in excess. Salt is one of the oldest, most ubiquitous food seasonings and [[Salting (food)|salting]] is an important method of [[food preservation]]. The [[taste]] of salt (saltiness) is one of the [[Basic tastes|basic human taste]]s.

Salt for human consumption is produced in different forms: unrefined salt (such as [[sea salt]]), refined salt (table salt), and [[iodized salt]]. It is a crystalline solid, white, pale pink or light gray in color, normally obtained from [[sea water]] or rock deposits. Edible rock salts may be slightly grayish in color because of mineral content.

Because of its importance to survival, salt has often been considered a valuable commodity during human history. However, as salt consumption has increased during modern times, scientists have become aware of the health risks associated with high salt intake, including [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] in sensitive individuals. Therefore, some health authorities have recommended limitations of dietary sodium, although others state the risk is minimal for typical western diets.

In Africa, the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] have traditionally maintained routes across the [[Sahara]] especially for the transportation of salt by [[Azalai]] (salt caravans). In 1960, the caravans still carried some 15,000 tons of salt a year but this trade has now declined to roughly a third of that figure.<ref>Onbekende Wereld by Wim Offeciers (based on [[Douchan Gersi]]'s travels)</ref>

[[Salzburg]], [[Hallstatt]], and [[Hallein]] lie within {{convert|17|km|sp=us}} of each other on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with extensive salt deposits. [[Salzach]] literally means "salt water" and Salzburg "salt city", both taking their names from the [[German language|German]] word  {{lang|de|''Salz''}} meaning salt.

In 1930, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] led at least 100,000 people on the "Dandi March" or "[[Salt Satyagraha]]", in which protesters made their own salt from the sea, which was illegal under [[British rule]], as it avoided paying the "[[History of the British salt tax in India|salt tax]]". This [[civil disobedience]] inspired millions of common people, and elevated the [[Indian independence movement]] from an elitist struggle to a national struggle.<ref>"Mass civil disobedience throughout India followed as millions broke the salt laws", from Dalton's introduction to Gandhi's ''Civil Disobedience''.

==Forms of salt==

===Unrefined salt===
{{Main|Sea salt|Halite|Fleur de sel}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seasalt.jpg|thumb|A commercial pack of sea salt]] -->
Different natural salts have different [[Minerality#I.E2.80.93P|mineralities]] depending on their source, giving each one a unique flavor. [[Fleur de sel]], a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a unique flavor varying with the region from which it is produced. In traditional [[Korean cuisine]], so-called "[[Jukyeom|bamboo salt]]" is prepared by roasting salt<ref name="soilpollu">{{cite book |author=James V. Livingston |title=Agriculture and soil pollution: new research |publisher=Nova Publishers |year=2005 |page=45 |isbn=1-59454-310-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W6ToDne5AsMC&pg=PA45}}</ref> in a [[bamboo]] container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the [[clastogen|anticlastogenic]] and [[mutagen|antimutagenic]] properties of [[doenjang]] (a fermented  bean paste).<ref name="AsianFood">{{cite book |author=Shahidi, Fereidoon; John Shi; Ho, Chi-Tang |title=Asian functional foods |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2005 |page=575 |isbn=0-8247-5855-2}}</ref>

Unrefined sea salt contains small amounts of [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]] [[halides]] and [[sulfates]], traces of [[algae|algal products]], salt-resistant bacteria, and sediment particles.<ref name="McGee">Harold McGee. On Food and Cooking, Scribner, 2nd Edition, 2004. pg. 642.</ref> The calcium/magnesium salts make unrefined sea salt [[hygroscopic]] (it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered) and confer a faintly bitter overtone. Algal products contribute a mildly "fishy" or "sea-air" odor, the latter from [[Organobromine compound#Organobromine compounds in nature|organobromine compounds]]. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull gray appearance. Since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavor than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavors would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients.<ref name="McGee" />

The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough [[iodine]] salts to prevent [[Iodine deficiency|iodine deficiency diseases]].<ref>{{cite web|title=References on food salt & health issues|url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Articles-references/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-food-salt-health-issues|publisher=Salt Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010|year=2009}}</ref>

===Refined salt===
[[File:Piles of Salt Salar de Uyuni Bolivia Luca Galuzzi 2006 a.jpg|thumb|left|Salt mounds in [[Salar de Uyuni]], Bolivia]]
[[Refining|Refined]] salt, the most widely used form, is mainly composed of sodium chloride. Food grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] (3&nbsp;percent in Europe)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eu-salt.com/index3.htm | title=European Salt Producers' Association | publisher=Eu-salt.com | accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5&nbsp;percent of salt production.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.roskill.com/reports/salt | title=Roskill Information Services | publisher=Roskill.com | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> The main bulk is sold for industrial use where it has great commercial value as a necessary ingredient in many manufacturing processes. A few common examples include the production of [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] and paper, the use as a [[mordant]] in the dyeing of [[textile]]s and the making of [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/salt/myb1-2008-salt.pdf |title=Salt |author=Kostick, Dennis S. |year=2008 |work= Minerals Yearbook |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>

The manufacture and use of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.salt.org.il/arch.html | title=Salt made the world go round | work=Salt.org.il | date=1 September 1997 | accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> Salt can be obtained by evaporation of [[sea water]], usually in shallow basins warmed by [[sunlight]];<ref>[http://nauticus.org/currwthrless043.html Nauticus – Weather Curriculum]. Nauticus.org. Retrieved 7 July 2011.</ref> salt so obtained was formerly called bay salt, and is now often called sea salt or solar salt. Rock salt deposits are formed by the evaporation of ancient salt lakes,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090223185841/http://www.saltsense.co.uk/aboutsalt-what01.htm What is salt?] UK Salt Manufacturers' Association</ref> and may be [[mining|mined]] conventionally or through the injection of water. Injected water dissolves the salt, and the [[brine]] solution can be pumped to the surface where the salt is collected. The raw salt is then refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. Purification usually involves recrystallization. In this process, a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are [[kiln]]-dried.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090409144219/http://www.saltsense.co.uk/aboutsalt-prod02.htm About salt: Production].

===Table salt===
In many cuisines around the world, salt is used in cooking, and is often found in [[salt shaker]]s on diners' eating tables for their personal use on food. Table salt is refined salt, which contains about 97 to 99&nbsp;percent [[sodium chloride]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tesco Table Salt 750g|url=http://www.tesco.com/superstore/xpi/8/xpi50042778.htm|publisher=Tesco|accessdate=5 December 2010|quote=Nutritional analysis provided with Tesco Table Salt states 38.9&nbsp;percent sodium by weight which equals 97.3&nbsp;percent sodium chloride}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wasalt.com.au/Table.html Table Salt].

Table salt has a [[particle density]] of 2.165 g/cm{{sup|3}}, and a [[bulk density]] (dry, [[ASTM]] D 632 gradation) of about 1.154 g/cm{{sup|3}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physical properties|url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/About-salt/Physical-properties|publisher=Salt Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010|year=2010}}</ref>

====Additives in table salt====
Most table salt sold for consumption contain additives which address a variety of health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country.

=====Iodine and iodide=====
{{main|Iodized salt}}
Iodine is important to prevent the insufficient production of [[thyroid hormone]]s ([[hypothyroidism]]), which can cause goiter, [[cretinism]] in children, and [[myxedema]] in adults.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chakera |first1=A J |last2=Pearce |first2=S H |last3=Vaidya |first3=B |title=Treatment for primary hypothyroidism: current approaches and future possibilities. |journal=Drug design, development and therapy |volume=6 |pages=1–11 |year=2012 |pmid=22291465|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S12894 }}</ref> Iodine-containing compounds are added to table salt. ''Iodized salt'' is thus table salt mixed with a minute amount of [[potassium iodide]], [[sodium iodide]], or [[sodium iodate]]. A small amount of [[dextrose]] may also be added to stabilize the iodine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extension.psu.edu/food-safety/food-preservation/faq/canning-and-pickling-salt |title=Canning and Pickling salt |publisher=Penn State University}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/food-salt-faqs|publisher = Morton Salt |title=FAQs}}</ref>

Iodized salt is used to help reduce the incidence of [[iodine deficiency]] in humans. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of [[mental retardation]].<ref name="mcneil">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html |title=In Raising the World's I.Q., the Secret's in the Salt|last=McNeil|first=Donald G.

Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iodized salt|url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Uses-benefits/Salt-in-Food/Essential-nutrient/Iodized-salt|publisher=Salt Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010|year=2009}}</ref>

The amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies from country to country. In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] recommends [21 CFR 101.9 (c)(8)(iv)] 150 [[micrograms]] of iodine per day for both men and women. US iodized salt contains 46–77 ppm (parts per million), whereas in the UK the iodine content of iodized salt is recommended to be 10–22 ppm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discussion Paper on the setting of maximum and minimum amounts for vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/supplements/documents/akj_en.pdf|publisher=Directorate-General Health & Consumers |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref>

=====Fluoride=====
A lack of [[fluorine]] in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of [[dental caries]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Selwitz, R H; Ismail, A I; Pitts, N B |year=2007 |title=Dental caries |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9555 |pages=51–59 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60031-2 |pmid=17208642 }}</ref>  [[Fluoride]] salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where [[water fluoridation]] is not carried out. In France, 35&nbsp;percent of the table salt sold contains added [[sodium fluoride]].<ref name=Ullmann>Gisbert Westphal, Gerhard Kristen, Wilhelm Wegener, Peter Ambatiello, Helmut Geyer, Bernard Epron, Christian Bonal, Georg Steinhauser, Franz Götzfried "Sodium Chloride" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_317.pub4}}</ref>

=====Anti-caking agents=====
[[Sodium ferrocyanide]], also known as yellow prussiate of soda, is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption.<ref name="hansard.millbanksystems.com"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scan/out70_en.pdf | title=Ferrocyanides in salt for feed use is acceptable as regards safety for target animals and human consumer... | format=PDF | accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when [[magnesium carbonate]] was first added to salt to make it flow more freely.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morton Salt FAQ |url=http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/general-company-faqs#q3 |accessdate =12 May 2007}}</ref> The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the [[Committee on Toxicity]] in 1988.<ref name="hansard.millbanksystems.com">[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/may/05/table-salt Discussions of the safety of sodium hexaferrocyanate in table salt].

Both the European Union and the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) permitted the use of [[aluminum]] in the latter two compounds.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Wilella Daniels | last1=Burgess | first2=April C. | last2=Mason | url=http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/HE/HE-625.html | title=What Are All Those Chemicals in My Food? | publisher=School of Consumer and Family Sciences, Purdue University | accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>

=====Iron=====
In "doubly fortified salt", both iodide and iron salts are added. This additive alleviates [[iron deficiency anemia]], which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40&nbsp;percent of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is [[Iron(II) fumarate|ferrous fumarate]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

=====Other additives=====
Another additive, especially important for [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women, is [[folic acid]] (vitamin B<sub>9</sub>), which gives the table salt a yellow color. Folic acid helps prevent [[neural tube defect]]s (NTDs) and anemia, which affect young mothers, especially in developing countries.<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Salty condiments===
In many East Asian cultures, salt is not traditionally used as a condiment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2001/0729/taste.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=The Salt of Southeast Asia | accessdate=7 July 2011 | year=2001}}</ref> In its place, condiments such as [[soy sauce]], [[fish sauce]] and [[oyster sauce]] tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diet.com/g/asian-diet |title=Asian diet |publisher=Diet.com |accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref>

==Health effects==
[[File:Salt1.jpg|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a grain of table salt]]
[[Chloride]] and [[sodium]] ions, the two major components of salt, are needed by all known living creatures in small quantities. Salt is involved in regulating the [[water]] content ([[fluid balance]]) of the body. The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.090034797|title=Sodium channel Nav1.6 is localized at nodes of Ranvier, dendrites, and synapses|year=2000|last1=Caldwell|first1=J.

A 2009 [[meta-analysis]] found that the sodium consumption of 19,151 individuals from 33 countries fit into the narrow range of 2,700 to 4,900&nbsp;mg/day. The small range across many cultures, together with animal studies, suggest that sodium intake is tightly controlled by feedback loops in the body, making recommendations to reduce sodium consumption below 2,700&nbsp;mg/day potentially futile.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2215/CJN.04660709|title=Can Dietary Sodium Intake Be Modified by Public Policy?|year=2009|last1=McCarron|first1=D.

===Labeling===

UK: The [[Food Standards Agency]] defines the level of salt in foods as follows: "High is more than 1.5 g salt per 100 g (or 0.6 g sodium). Low is 0.3 g salt or less per 100 g (or 0.1 g sodium). If the amount of salt per 100 g is in between these figures, then that is a medium level of salt." In the UK, foods produced by some supermarkets and manufacturers have 'traffic light' colors on the front of the pack: red (high), amber (medium), or green (low).<ref>[http://www.salt.gov.uk/understanding_labels.html Understanding labels]. Salt.gov.uk (6 November 2009). Retrieved 7 July 2011.</ref>

USA: The FDA ''Food Labeling Guide'' stipulates whether a food can be labeled as "free" "low," or "reduced/less" in respect of sodium. When other health claims are made about a food (e.g., low in fat, calories, etc.), a disclosure statement is required if the food exceeds 480&nbsp;mg of sodium per 'serving'.<ref>Food and Drug Administration [http://web.archive.org/web/20060321031336/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/flg-6a.html A Food Labeling Guide—Appendix A]</ref>

The world's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated.<ref name=IHS/> The [[sea salt|evaporation of seawater]] is the method of choice in areas of high evaporation and low precipitation. Elsewhere salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either [[salt mine|mined]] direct, producing rock salt ([[halite]]), or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation in pans under vacuum.<ref name=Kostick>{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/salt/myb1-2010-salt.pdf |title=Salt |author=Kostick, Dennis S. |date=2011-11-01 |work=2010 Minerals Yearbook |publisher=USGS |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>
