'''Toxoplasmosis''' is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by the [[protozoan]] ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages = 723–7 |publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0838585299 }}</ref>  The parasite infects most [[genus|genera]] of [[warm-blooded]] animals, including humans, but the primary host is the [[Felidae|felid (cat) family]]. Animals are infected by eating infected meat, by [[coprophagia|ingestion of feces]] of a [[cat]] that has itself recently been infected, or by transmission from mother to fetus. Cats are the primary source of infection to human hosts, although contact with raw meat, especially pork, is a more significant source of human infections in some countries. Fecal contamination of hands is a significant risk factor.<ref name=Torda_2001>{{cite journal |author=Torda A |title=Toxoplasmosis.

Nicolle and Manceaux first described the organism in 1908, after they observed the parasites in the blood, spleen, and liver of a North African rodent, Ctenodactylus gondii. The parasite was named ''Toxoplasma ''(arclike form) ''gondii'' (after the rodent) in 1909. In 1923, Janku reported parasitic cysts in the retina of an infant who had hydrocephalus, seizures, and unilateral microphthalmia. Wolf, Cowan, and Paige (1937–1939) determined these findings represented the syndrome of severe congenital ''T. gondii'' infection.<ref name=Torda_2001>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/229969-overview ]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
<!--{{Multiple issues|

}}-->

Infection has two stages:
=== Acute toxoplasmosis ===
During [[Acute (medical)|acute]] toxoplasmosis, symptoms are often [[influenza]]-like: swollen [[lymph node]]s, or [[myalgia|muscle aches]] and pains that last for a month or more.  Rarely will a patient with a fully functioning [[immune system]] develop severe symptoms following infection. Young children and [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS, those taking certain types of [[chemotherapy]], or those who have recently received an [[organ transplant]], may develop severe toxoplasmosis. This can cause damage to the brain ([[encephalitis]]) or the eyes ([[Toxoplasmic chorioretinitis|necrotizing retinochoroiditis]]). Infants infected via placental transmission may be born with either of these problems, or with nasal malformations, although these complications are rare in newborns. The toxoplasmic trophozoites causing acute toxoplasmosis are referred to as Tachyzoites, and are typically found in bodily fluids.

Swollen lymph nodes are commonly found in the neck or under the chin, followed by the axillae (armpits) and the groin. Swelling may occur at different times after the initial infection, persist, and/or recur for various times independently of antiparasitic treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paul M |title=Immunoglobulin G Avidity in Diagnosis of Toxoplasmic Lymphadenopathy and Ocular Toxoplasmosis |journal=Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=514–8 |date=1 July 1999|pmid=10391853 |pmc=95718 |url=http://cvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10391853 }}</ref> It is usually found at single sites in adults, but in children, multiple sites may be more common. Enlarged lymph nodes will resolve within one to two months in 60% of patients. However, a quarter of patients take two to four months to return to normal, and 8% take four to six months. A substantial number of patients (6%) do not return to normal until much later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~ukneqas.parasitologyscheme/Toxoplasma_Scheme/Teaching_Information/_Lymphadenopathy/_lymphadenopathy.html |title=Lymphadenopathy |publisher=Btinternet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref>

===Latent toxoplasmosis===
It is easy for a host to become infected with ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' and develop toxoplasmosis without knowing it. In most immunocompetent patients, the infection enters a latent phase, during which only [[bradyzoite]]s are present, forming [[cyst]]s in [[nervous tissue|nervous]] and [[muscle]] tissue. Most infants who are infected while in the womb have no symptoms at birth, but may develop symptoms later in life.<ref>Randall Parker: [http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/001675.html Humans Get Personality Altering Infections From Cats]. September 30, 2003</ref>

===Cutaneous toxoplasmosis===
While rare, skin lesions may occur in the acquired form of the disease, including roseola and erythema multiforme-like eruptions, [[prurigo]]-like nodules, [[urticaria]], and maculopapular lesions. Newborns may have [[punctate macules]], [[ecchymoses]], or “blueberry muffin” lesions.
Diagnosis of cutaneous toxoplasmosis is based on the tachyzoite form of ''T. gondii'' being found in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. It is found in all levels of the epidermis, is about 6 μm by 2 μm and bow-shaped, with the nucleus being one-third of its size.  It can be identified by electron microscopy or by [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]] staining tissue where the cytoplasm shows blue, the nucleus red.<ref>{{Fitzpatrick 6|235}}</ref>

=== Psychiatric disorders ===
[[Image:Toxoplasmosis lymphadenopathy - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a lymph node showing the characteristic changes of toxoplasmosis (scattered epithelioid histiocytes (pale cells), monocytoid cells (top-center of image), large germinal centers (left of image)) [[H&E stain]]]]
Studies have shown the toxoplasmosis parasite may affect behavior and may present as or be a causative or contributory factor in various psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and [[schizophrenia]].<ref>Kar N, Misra B.Toxoplasma seropositivity and depression: a case report.

Individuals with schizophrenia are also more likely to report a clinical history of toxoplasmosis than those in the general population.<ref>redOrbit:[http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1657166/researchers_link_parasites_to_schizophrenia/ Researchers Link Parasites To Schizophrenia]. March 19, 2009</ref>  Recent work at the [[University of Leeds]] has found the parasite produces an enzyme with [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] and [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] activity.  This enzyme may contribute to the behavioral changes observed in toxoplasmosis by altering the production of [[dopamine]], a [[neurotransmitter]] involved in mood, sociability, attention, motivation, and sleep patterns.  Schizophrenia has long been linked to dopamine dysregulation.<ref>Science Daily: [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090311085151.htm Toxoplasmosis Parasite May Trigger Schizophrenia And Bipolar Disorders].

Chronic infection with ''T. gondii'' has traditionally been considered [[asymptomatic]] in [[immunocompetent]] human hosts. However, accumulating evidence suggests latent infection may subtly influence a range of human behaviors and tendencies, and infection may alter the susceptibility to or intensity of a number of [[Mood disorder|affective]], [[Mental disorder|psychiatric]], or neurological disorders.<ref name=Webster2013>{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=JP|coauthors=Kaushik, M; Bristow, GC; McConkey, GA|title=Toxoplasma gondii infection, from predation to schizophrenia: can animal behaviour help us understand human behaviour?|journal=The Journal of experimental biology|date=2013 Jan 1|volume=216|issue=Pt 1|pages=99–112|pmid=23225872}}</ref>

Latent ''T. gondii'' infection in humans has been associated with impaired [[psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] performance, enhanced risk-taking personality profiles, and higher incidence of [[automobile accidents]].<ref name=Webster2013 />   Moreover, correlations have been found between positive antibody [[titer]]s to ''T. gondii'' and [[OCD]],  [[Parkinson’s disease]], [[Alzheimer’s disease]], [[suicide]] in patients with mood disorders, and [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name=Webster2013 /> Positive antibody titers to ''T. gondii'' have been shown to be not correlative with [[major depression]] or [[dysthymia]].<ref name=Pearce2012>{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=BD|coauthors=Kruszon-Moran, D; Jones, JL|title=The relationship between Toxoplasma gondii infection and mood disorders in the third National Health and Nutrition Survey.|journal=Biological psychiatry|date=2012 Aug 15|volume=72|issue=4|pages=290–5|pmid=22325983}}</ref>  

The most substantial body of evidence linking ''T. gondii'' to a neurological disorder involves the potential association between [[schizophrenia]] and infection with the parasite.<ref name=Webster2010>{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=JP|coauthors=McConkey, GA|title=Toxoplasma ''gondii''-altered host behaviour: clues as to mechanism of action.|journal=Folia parasitologica|date=2010 Jun|volume=57|issue=2|pages=95–104|pmid=20608471}}</ref><ref name=Torrey2007>{{cite journal|last=Torrey|first=EF|coauthors=Yolken, RH|title=Schizophrenia and toxoplasmosis.|journal=Schizophrenia bulletin|date=2007 May|volume=33|issue=3|pages=727–8|pmid=17426051}}</ref>  As of 2013, at least 38 studies have found a positive correlation between ''T. gondii'' antibody titers and schizophrenia.<ref name=Webster2013 /><ref name=Torrey2012>{{cite journal|last=Torrey|first=EF|coauthors=Bartko, JJ; Yolken, RH|title=Toxoplasma gondii and other risk factors for schizophrenia: an update.|journal=Schizophrenia bulletin|date=2012 May|volume=38|issue=3|pages=642–7|pmid=22446566}}</ref>  While the vast majority of these studies tested patients already diagnosed with schizophrenia for ''T. gondii'' antibodies, significant associations between ''T. gondii'' and schizophrenia have been found prior to the onset of schizophrenia disease symptoms.<ref name=Webster2010 />

In most of the current studies where positive associations have been found between ''T. gondii'' antibody titers and certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders, ''T. gondii'' seropositivity tests are conducted after the onset of the examined disease or behavioral trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite.<ref name=Flegr2013>{{cite journal|last=Flegr|first=J|title=Influence of latent Toxoplasma infection on human personality, physiology and morphology: pros and cons of the Toxoplasma-human model in studying the manipulation hypothesis.|journal=The Journal of experimental biology|date=2013 Jan 1|volume=216|issue=Pt 1|pages=127–33|pmid=23225875}}</ref> Groups of individuals with certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders may share certain behavioral tendencies that increase the likelihood of exposure to and infection with ''T. gondii''; as a result, it is difficult to confirm causal relationships between ''T. gondii'' infections and associated neurological disorders or behavioral traits.<ref name=Flegr2013 />

== Diagnosis ==
Toxoplasmosis can be difficult to distinguish from [[primary central nervous system lymphoma]], and as a result, the diagnosis is made by a trial of therapy ([[pyrimethamine]], [[sulfadiazine]], and [[folinic acid]] ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]: leucovorin)), followed by a brain [[biopsy]] if the drugs produce no effect clinically and no improvement on repeat imaging. 

Detection of ''T. gondii'' in human blood samples may also be achieved by using the [[polymerase chain reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ho-Yen DO, Joss AW, Balfour AH, Smyth ET, Baird D, Chatterton JM |title=Use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect Toxoplasma gondii in human blood samples |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=910–3 |year=1992 |month=October |pmid=1430262 |pmc=495065 |doi=10.1136/jcp.45.10.910 |url=http://jcp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1430262}}</ref> Inactive cysts may exist in a host which would evade detection.

Toxoplasmosis cannot be detected with [[immunohistochemistry|immunostaining]].  Lymph nodes affected by ''Toxoplasma'' have characteristic changes, including poorly demarcated reactive [[germinal centers]], clusters of monocytoid B cells, and scattered epithelioid [[histiocyte]]s.

== Transmission ==
[[File:Toxoplasma gondii Life cycle PHIL 3421 lores.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Lifecycle of ''Toxoplasma gondii'']]
Transmission may occur through:
* Ingestion of raw or partly cooked meat, especially pork, lamb, or venison containing ''Toxoplasma'' cysts: Infection prevalence in countries where undercooked meat is traditionally eaten has been related to this transmission method. Tissue cysts may also be ingested during hand-to-mouth contact after handling undercooked meat, or from using knives, utensils, or cutting boards contaminated by raw meat.<ref name=CDC>{{cite web

| date=2004-11-22 }}</ref>
* Ingestion of contaminated cat [[feces]]: This can occur through hand-to-mouth contact following gardening, cleaning a cat's [[litter box]], contact with children's sandpits, or touching a leech; the parasite can survive in the environment for over a year.<ref>[http://www.ncagr.com/vet/ToxoplasmosisTxt.htm North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services]</ref>

Cats excrete the pathogen in their feces for a number of weeks after contracting the disease, generally by eating an infected rodent. Even then, cat feces are not generally contagious for the first day or two after excretion, after which the cyst 'ripens' and becomes potentially pathogenic.<ref name=CDC2>{{cite web

=== Pregnancy precautions ===
[[Congenital]] toxoplasmosis is a special form in which an unborn fetus is infected via the [[placenta]]. A positive antibody [[titer]] indicates previous exposure and immunity, and largely ensures the unborn fetus' safety. A simple blood draw at the first prenatal doctor visit can determine whether or not a woman has had previous exposure and therefore whether or not she is at risk. If a woman receives her first exposure to ''T. gondii'' while pregnant, the fetus is at particular risk.  A woman with no previous exposure should avoid handling [[raw meat]], exposure to cat feces, and gardening (cat feces are common in garden soil). Most cats are not actively shedding [[oocyst]]s, so are not a danger, but the risk may be reduced further by having the litter box emptied daily (oocysts require longer than a single day to become infective), and by having someone else empty the litter box. However, while risks can be minimized, they cannot be eliminated. For pregnant women with negative antibody titers, indicating no previous exposure to ''T. gondii'', serology testing as frequent as monthly is advisable as treatment during pregnancy for those women exposed to ''T. gondii'' for the first time decreases dramatically the risk of passing the parasite to the fetus.

Despite these risks, pregnant women are not routinely screened for toxoplasmosis in most countries ([[Portugal]],<ref name=Circular_DGS>[http://www.srsdocs.com/parcerias/normas/circulares/dgs/2006/cuidados_pre_concepcionais.pdf Circular Normativa sobre Cuidados Pré-Concepcionais – Direcção-Geral de Saúde]</ref> [[France]],<ref name=Sukthana_2006/> [[Austria]],<ref name=Sukthana_2006/> [[Uruguay]],<ref name=elpais>[http://participacion.elpais.com.uy/lasalud/2008/05/20/los-gatos-domesticos-transmiten-toxoplasmosis/ ]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> and [[Italy]]<ref name=Paschale_2008>M.

''Clinical Microbiology and Infection'' Volume 14 Issue 2 (2007), Pages 186–189.</ref> being the exceptions) for reasons of cost-effectiveness and the high number of [[false positives]] generated. As invasive [[prenatal]] testing incurs some risk to the [[fetus]] (18.5 pregnancy losses per toxoplasmosis case prevented),<ref name=Sukthana_2006/> [[postnatal]] or [[neonatal]] screening is preferred. The exceptions are cases where [[fetal]] abnormalities are noted, and thus screening can be targeted.<ref name=Sukthana_2006/>

Some regional screening programmes operate in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=Paschale_2008/>

Treatment is very important for recently infected [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women, to prevent infection of the fetus. Since a baby's immune system does not develop fully for the first year of life, and the resilient cysts that form throughout the body are very difficult to eradicate with antiprotozoans, an infection can be very serious in the young.

In 2006, a Czech research team discovered women with high levels of toxoplasmosis antibodies were significantly more likely to have baby boys than baby girls. In most populations, the birth rate is around 51% boys, but women infected with ''T. gondii'' had up to a 72% chance of a boy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Sample, science correspondent |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/oct/12/uk.health |title=Pregnant women infected by cat parasite more likely to give birth to boys, say researchers &#124; Science |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-02-14}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Treatment is often only recommended for people with serious health problems, such as HIV patients with CD4 counts under 200, because the disease is most serious when one's immune system is weak.  [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] is the drug of choice to prevent toxoplasmosis, but is not the drug to treat.

===Acute===
The medications prescribed for acute toxoplasmosis are:
* [[Pyrimethamine]] — an [[antimalarial medication]]
* [[Sulfadiazine]] — an [[antibiotic]] used in combination with pyrimethamine to treat toxoplasmosis
** Combination therapy is usually given with folic acid supplements to reduce incidence of [[thrombocytopaenia]].
** Combination therapy is most useful in the setting of HIV.
* [[Clindamycin]]
* [[Spiramycin]] — an antibiotic used most often for pregnant women to prevent the infection of their children
(other antibiotics, such as [[minocycline]], have seen some use as a [[salvage therapy]]).

===Latent===
In people with latent toxoplasmosis, the cysts are immune to these treatments, as the antibiotics do not reach the [[bradyzoite]]s in sufficient concentration.

== Epidemiology ==
''T. gondii'' infections occur throughout the world, although infection rates differ significantly by country.<ref name=Pappas2009>{{cite journal|last=Pappas|first=G|coauthors=Roussos, N; Falagas, ME|title=Toxoplasmosis snapshots: global status of Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence and implications for pregnancy and congenital toxoplasmosis.|journal=International journal for parasitology|date=2009 Oct|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1385–94|pmid=19433092}}</ref>  For women of childbearing age, a survey of 99 studies within 44 countries found the areas of highest prevalence are within [[Latin America]] (about 50–80%), parts of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]] (about 20–60%), the [[Middle East]] (about30-50%), parts of [[Southeast Asia]] (about 20–60%), and parts of [[Africa]] (about 20–55%).<ref name=Pappas2009 />   

In the [[United States]], data from the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES) from 1999 to 2004 found  9.0% of US-born persons 12–49 years of age were [[seropositive]] for [[IgG]] [[antibodies]] against ''T. gondii'', down from 14.1% as measured in the NHANES 1988–1994.<ref name=Jones2007>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=JL|coauthors=Kruszon-Moran, D; Sanders-Lewis, K; Wilson, M|title=Toxoplasma gondii infection in the United States, 1999 2004, decline from the prior decade.|journal=The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene|date=2007 Sep|volume=77|issue=3|pages=405–10|pmid=17827351}}</ref> In the 1999–2004 survey, 7.7% of US-born and 28.1% of foreign-born women 15–44 years of age were ''T. gondii'' seropositive.<ref name=Jones2007 />  A trend of decreasing [[seroprevalence]] has been observed by numerous studies in the United States and many European countries.<ref name=Pappas2009 />  

Because the parasite poses a particular threat to fetuses when it is contracted during pregnancy,<ref name=CDCPregnant>{{cite web|title=CDC: Parasites – Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection) – Pregnant Women|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref>  much of the global [[epidemiological]] data regarding ''T. gondii'' comes from seropositivity tests in women of childbearing age. Seropositivity tests look for the presence of antibodies against ''T. gondii'' in blood, so while seropositivity guarantees one has been exposed to the parasite, it does not necessarily guarantee one is chronically infected.<ref name=Dubey1998Rats>{{cite journal|last=Dubey|first=JP|coauthors=Frenkel, JK|title=Toxoplasmosis of rats: a review, with considerations of their value as an animal model and their possible role in epidemiology.|journal=Veterinary parasitology|date=1998 May|volume=77|issue=1|pages=1–32|pmid=9652380}}</ref>

==History ==
The ''T. gondii'' protozoan was first discovered by Nicolle and Manceaux, who in 1908 isolated it from the African rodent ''[[Gundi|Ctenodactylus gundi]]'', then in 1909 [[wikt:differentiate|differentiated]] the organism from ''[[Leishmania]]'' and named it ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''.<ref name=Sukthana_2006>{{cite journal |author=Sukthana Y |title=Toxoplasmosis: beyond animals to humans |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=137–42 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16446116 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2006.01.007 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471-4922(06)00023-7}}</ref> The first recorded [[congenital]] case was not until 1923, and the first adult case not until 1940.<ref name=Sukthana_2006/> In 1948, a [[serological]] dye test was created by Sabin and Feldman, which is now the standard basis for diagnostic tests.<ref>[http://www.pamf.org/serology/clinicianguide.html#toxosero Toxoplasma Serology Laboratory: Laboratory Tests For The Diagnosis Of Toxoplasmosis]</ref>

==Other animals ==
Although ''T. gondii'' has the capability of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, susceptibility and rates of infection vary widely between different [[genera]] and [[species]].<ref>J.P Dubey (2010)</ref> Rates of infection in populations of the same species can also vary widely due to differences in location, diet, and other factors.

=== Livestock ===
Among [[livestock]], pigs, sheep, and goats have the highest rates of chronic ''T. gondii'' infection.<ref name=Tenter2000>{{cite journal|last=Tenter|first=AM|coauthors=Heckeroth, AR; Weiss, LM|title=Toxoplasma gondii: from animals to humans.|journal=International journal for parasitology|date=2000 Nov|volume=30|issue=12–13|pages=1217–58|pmid=11113252}}</ref> The prevalence of ''T. gondii'' in meat-producing animals varies widely both within and between countries,<ref name=Tenter2000 />  and rates of infection have been shown to be dramatically influenced by varying farming and management practices.<ref name=Dubey2008>{{cite journal|last=Dubey|first=JP|coauthors=Jones, JL|title=Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans and animals in the United States.|journal=International journal for parasitology|date=2008 Sep|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1257–78|pmid=18508057}}</ref> For instance, animals kept outdoors or in [[Free range|free-ranging]] environments are more at risk of  infection than animals raised indoors or in commercial [[Factory farming|confinement operations]].<ref name=Dubey2008 /><ref name=Jones2012Foodborne>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=JL|coauthors=Dubey, JP|title=Foodborne toxoplasmosis.|journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=2012 Sep|volume=55|issue=6|pages=845–51|pmid=22618566}}</ref>  

In the United States, the percentage of pigs harboring viable parasites has been measured (via [[bioassay]] in mice or cats) to be as high as 92.7% and as low as 0%, depending on the farm or herd.<ref name=Jones2012Foodborne />  Surveys of seroprevalence (''T. gondii'' antibodies in blood) are more common, and such measurements are indicative of the high relative seroprevlance in pigs across the world.<ref>J.P Dubey (2010) p. 145-151</ref>  Along with pigs, sheep and goats are among the most commonly infected livestock of epidemiological significance for human infection.<ref name=Tenter2000 /> Prevalence of viable ''T. gondii'' in sheep tissue has been measured (via bioassay) to be as high as 78% in the United States,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dubey|first=JP|coauthors=Sundar, N; Hill, D; Velmurugan, GV; Bandini, LA; Kwok, OC; Majumdar, D; Su, C|title=High prevalence and abundant atypical genotypes of ''Toxoplasma gondii'' isolated from lambs destined for human consumption in the USA.|journal=International journal for parasitology|date=2008 Jul|volume=38|issue=8–9|pages=999–1006|pmid=18191859}}</ref>  and a 2011 survey of goats intended for consumption in the United States found a seroprevalence of 53.4%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dubey|first=JP|coauthors=Rajendran, C; Ferreira, LR; Martins, J; Kwok, OC; Hill, DE; Villena, I; Zhou, H; Su, C; Jones, JL|title=High prevalence and genotypes of''Toxoplasma gondii'' isolated from goats, from a retail meat store, destined for human consumption in the USA.|journal=International journal for parasitology|date=2011 Jul|volume=41|issue=8|pages=827–33|pmid=21515278}}</ref> 

Due to a lack of exposure to the outdoors, chickens raised in large-scale indoor confinement operations are not commonly infected with ''T. gondii''.<ref name=Dubey2008 /> Free-ranging or backyard-raised chickens are much more commonly infected.<ref name=Dubey2008 /> A survey of free-ranging chickens in the United States found its prevalence to be 17%–100%, depending on the farm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dubey|first=JP|title=Toxoplasma gondii infections in chickens (''Gallus domesticus''): prevalence, clinical disease, diagnosis and public health significance.|journal=Zoonoses and public health|date=2010 Feb|volume=57|issue=1|pages=60–73|pmid=19744305}}</ref>   Because chicken meat is generally cooked thoroughly before consumption, poultry is not generally considered to be a significant risk factor for human ''T. gondii''infection.<ref>Louis M Weiss, Kami Kim (2011) p. 723</ref>  

Although cattle and buffalo can be infected with ''T. gondii'', the parasite is generally eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels within a few weeks following exposure.<ref name=Dubey2008 /> Tissue cysts are rarely present in buffalo meat or beef, and meat from these animals is considered to be low-risk for harboring viable parasites.<ref name=Tenter2000 /><ref name=Jones2012Foodborne />  

Horses are considered resistant to chronic ''T. gondii'' infection.<ref name=Dubey2008 />  However, viable cells have been isolated from US horses slaughtered for export, and severe human toxoplasmosis in France has been epidemiologically linked to the consumption of [[horse meat]].<ref name=Jones2012Foodborne />

=== Domestic cats ===
The seroprevalence of ''T. gondii'' in [[domestic cat]]s, worldwide, has been estimated to be around 30–40%.<ref name=Elmore2010>{{cite journal|last=Elmore|first=SA|coauthors=Jones, JL; Conrad, PA; Patton, S; Lindsay, DS; Dubey, JP|title=Toxoplasma gondii: epidemiology, feline clinical aspects, and prevention.|journal=Trends in parasitology|date=2010 Apr|volume=26|issue=4|pages=190–6|pmid=20202907}}</ref>  In the United States, no official national estimate has been made, but local surveys have shown levels varied between 16% ando 80%.<ref name=Elmore2010 />  A 2012 survey of 445 [[purebred]] pet cats and 45 shelter cats in [[Finland]] found an overall seroprevalence of 48.4%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jokelainen|first=P|coauthors=Simola, O; Rantanen, E; Näreaho, A; Lohi, H; Sukura, A|title=Feline toxoplasmosis in Finland: cross-sectional epidemiological study and case series study.|journal=Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc|date=2012 Nov|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1115–24|pmid=23012380}}</ref>  A 2010 survey of feral cats from [[Giza, Egypt]], found an overall seroprevalence of 97.4%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al-Kappany|first=YM|coauthors=Rajendran, C; Ferreira, LR; Kwok, OC; Abu-Elwafa, SA; Hilali, M; Dubey, JP|title=High prevalence of toxoplasmosis in cats from Egypt: isolation of viable ''Toxoplasma gondii'', tissue distribution, and isolate designation.|journal=The Journal of parasitology|date=2010 Dec|volume=96|issue=6|pages=1115–8|pmid=21158619}}</ref>  

''T. gondii'' infection rates in domestic cats vary widely depending on the cats' diets and lifestyles.<ref>J.P Dubey (2010) p. 95</ref>  [[Feral cat]]s that hunt for their food are more likely to be infected than domestic cats. The prevalence of ''T. gondii'' in cat populations depends on the availability of infected birds and small [[mammals]],<ref name=JPDubey2010p46>J.P Dubey (2010) p. 46</ref>  but often this prey is abundant.

Most infected cats will shed oocysts only once in their lifetimes, for a period of about one to two weeks.<ref name=Elmore2010 /> Although this period of shedding is quite transient, millions of oocysts can be shed, with each oocyst capable of spreading and surviving for months.<ref name=Elmore2010 />  An estimated 1% of cats at any given time are actively shedding oocysts.<ref name=Dubey2008 />
