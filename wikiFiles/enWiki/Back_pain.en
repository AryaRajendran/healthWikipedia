'''Back pain''' is [[pain]] felt in the [[human back|back]] that usually originates from the [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s, [[bone]]s, [[joint]]s or other structures in the [[Vertebral column|spine]].

Back pain may have a sudden onset or can be a [[chronic pain]]; it can be constant or intermittent, stay in one place or radiate to other areas. It may be a dull ache, or a sharp or piercing or burning sensation. The pain may radiate into the [[arm]]s and [[hand]]s as well as the [[human leg|legs]] or [[human foot|feet]], and may include symptoms other than pain. These symptoms may include tingling, weakness or numbness.

Back pain is one of humanity's most frequent complaints. In the [[United States of America|U.S.]], acute [[low back pain]] (also called [[lumbago]]) is the fifth most common reason for physician visits. About nine out of ten adults experience back pain at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults have back pain every year.<ref name=AAFP>A.T. Patel, A.A. Ogle. "[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000315/1779.html Diagnosis and Management of Acute Low Back Pain]". [[American Academy of Family Physicians]]. Retrieved March 12, 2007.</ref>

The spine is a complex interconnecting network of nerves, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments, all of which are capable of producing pain. Large nerves that originate in the spine and go to the legs and arms can make pain radiate to the extremities.<ref name=Burke>Burke, G.L., "[http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com Backache from Occiput to Coccyx]" Chapter 4</ref>

==Classification==
Back pain can be divided anatomically: [[neck pain]], [[middle back pain]], [[lower back pain]] or [[tailbone pain]].

By its duration: acute (less than 4 weeks), subacute (4&nbsp;– 12 weeks), chronic (greater than 12 weeks).

By its cause: nonspecific back pain, back pain with [[radiculopathy]] or [[spinal stenosis]], and back pain associated with another specific cause (such as infection or [[cancer]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vanwye|first=WR|title=Nonspecific low back pain: evaluation and treatment tips.|journal=The Journal of family practice|date=2010 Aug|volume=59|issue=8|pages=445–8|pmid=20714454}}</ref> Non specific pain indicates that the cause is not known precisely<ref>{{cite book|last=al.|first=editors, Curtis W.

Back pain is classified according to etiology in mechanical or nonspecific back pain and secondary back pain. Approximately 98% of back pain patients are diagnosed with nonspecific acute back pain which has no serious underlying pathology. However, secondary back pain which is caused by an underlying condition accounts for nearly 2% of the cases. Underlying pathology in these cases may include [[metastatic cancer]], spinal osteomyelitis and [[epidural abscess]] which account for 1% of the patients. Also, [[herniated disc]] is the most common neurologic impairment which is associated with this condition, from which 95% of disc herniations occur at the lowest two lumbar intervertebral levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/457101_3| title=Back Pain|accessdate= June 18, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100503135333/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/457101_3| archivedate= 3 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Associated conditions==
Back pain does not usually require immediate medical intervention. The vast majority of episodes of back pain are self-limiting and non-progressive. Most back pain syndromes are due to [[inflammation]], especially in the acute phase, which typically lasts from two weeks to three months.

Back pain can be a sign of a serious medical problem, although this is not most frequently the underlying cause:
* Typical warning signs of a potentially life-threatening problem are [[Intestine|bowel]] and/or [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] or progressive weakness in the legs.
* Severe back pain (such as pain that is bad enough to interrupt [[sleep]]) that occurs with other signs of severe illness (''e.g.'' [[fever]], unexplained [[weight loss]]) may also indicate a serious underlying medical condition.
* Back pain that occurs after a trauma, such as a car accident or fall, may indicate a [[bone fracture]] or other injury.
* Back pain in individuals with medical conditions that put them at high risk for a spinal fracture, such as [[osteoporosis]] or [[multiple myeloma]], also warrants prompt medical attention.
* Back pain in individuals with a history of cancer (especially cancers known to spread to the spine like breast, lung and prostate cancer) should be evaluated to rule out metastatic disease of the spine.

A few observational studies suggest that two conditions to which back pain is often attributed, [[lumbar disc herniation]] and [[degenerative disc disease]] may not be more prevalent among those in pain than among the general population, and that the mechanisms by which these conditions might cause pain are not known.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borenstein DG, O'Mara JW, Boden SD, ''et al.'' |title=The value of magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine to predict low-back pain in asymptomatic subjects: a seven-year follow-up study |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=83-A |issue=9 |pages=1306–11 |year=2001 |pmid=11568190 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01358742 |author=Savage RA, Whitehouse GH, Roberts N |title=The relationship between the magnetic resonance imaging appearance of the lumbar spine and low back pain, age and occupation in males |journal=Eur Spine J |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=106–14 |year=1997 |pmid=9209878 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jensen MC, Brant-Zawadzki MN, Obuchowski N, Modic MT, Malkasian D, Ross JS |title=Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine in people without back pain |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=331 |issue=2 |pages=69–73 |year=1994 |pmid=8208267 |doi = 10.1056/NEJM199407143310201}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kleinstück F, Dvorak J, Mannion AF |title=Are "structural abnormalities" on magnetic resonance imaging a contraindication to the successful conservative treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain? |journal=Spine |volume=31 |issue=19 |pages=2250–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16946663 |doi=10.1097/01.brs.0000232802.95773.89}}</ref> Other studies suggest that for as many as 85% of cases, no physiological cause can be shown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White AA, Gordon SL |title=Synopsis: workshop on idiopathic low-back pain |journal=Spine |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=141–9 |year=1982 |pmid=6211779|doi=10.1097/00007632-198203000-00009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=van den Bosch MA, Hollingworth W, Kinmonth AL, Dixon AK |title=Evidence against the use of lumbar spine radiography for low back pain |journal=Clinical radiology |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=69–76 |year=2004 |pmid=14697378 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2003.08.012}}</ref>

==Causes==
There are several potential sources and causes of back pain.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |author=Bogduk N |title=Clinical anatomy of the lumbar spine and sacrum |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2005 |edition=4th|isbn=0-443-06014-2 }}</ref> However, the diagnosis of specific tissues of the spine as the cause of pain presents problems. This is because symptoms arising from different spinal tissues can feel very similar and is difficult to differentiate without the use of invasive diagnostic intervention procedures, such as local [[anesthetic]] blocks.

One potential source of back pain is [[skeletal muscle]] of the back. Potential causes of pain in muscle tissue include [[strain (injury)|muscle strains (pulled muscles)]], muscle [[spasm]], and muscle imbalances. However, imaging studies do not support the notion of muscle tissue damage in many back pain cases, and the neurophysiology of muscle spasm and muscle imbalances is not well understood.

Another potential source of lower back pain is the [[synovial joints]] of the spine (e.g. [[zygapophysial joints]]/[[Zygapophysial joints|facet joints]]. These have been identified as the primary source of the pain in approximately one third of people with chronic low back pain, and in most people with neck pain following whiplash.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> However, the cause of zygapophysial joint pain is not fully understood. Capsule tissue damage has been proposed in people with neck pain following whiplash. In people with spinal pain stemming from zygapophysial joints, one theory is that intra-articular tissue such as invaginations of their synovial membranes and fibro-adipose meniscoids (that usually act as a cushion to help the bones move over each other smoothly) may become displaced, pinched or trapped, and consequently give rise to [[nociception]] (pain).

There are several common other potential sources and causes of back pain: these include [[spinal disc herniation]] and [[degenerative disc disease]] or isthmic spondylolisthesis, [[osteoarthritis|osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease)]] and [[lumbar spinal stenosis]], trauma, cancer, infection, fractures, and inflammatory disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/backpain/backpain.htm |title=Back Pain Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |publisher=Ninds.nih.gov |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2010-06-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100606033851/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/backpain/backpain.htm| archivedate= 6 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The anterior ligaments of the intervertebral disc are extremely sensitive, and even the slightest injury can cause significant pain.<ref>Burke,G.L.,MD, (1964, 2008).

Radicular pain ([[sciatica]]) is distinguished from 'non-specific' back pain, and may be diagnosed without invasive diagnostic tests.

New attention has been focused on ''non-discogenic back pain'', where patients have normal or near-normal [[MRI]] and [[CT scan]]s. One of the newer investigations looks into the role of the [[dorsal ramus]] in patients that have no radiographic abnormalities. See [[Posterior Rami Syndrome]].

==Diagnosis==
In the most common cases of low back pain, [[professional organizations]] recommend that physicians not immediately seek a diagnosis but instead begin treatment to reduce pain.<ref name="ACPfive">{{Citation |author1 = American College of Physicians |author1-link = Consumer Reports |author2-link = American College of Physicians |others = presented by [[ABIM Foundation]] |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American College of Physicians]] |work = Choosing Wisely |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_College_Phys.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name="backimage">{{Citation |author1 = Consumer Reports |author2 = American College of Physicians |author1-link = Consumer Reports |author2-link = American College of Physicians |others = presented by ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' |date = April 2012 |title = Imaging tests for lower-back pain: Why you probably don't need them. |publisher = [[Consumer Reports]] |work = High Value Care |page = |url = http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/High-Value-Care-Back-Pain-ACP.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name="NICEback">{{Citation |author=National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care |date = May 2009 |title =Low back pain: early management of persistent non-specific low back pain |publisher = [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |publication-place = |page = |url =http://www.nice.org.uk/CG88fullguideline |accessdate =9 September 2012}}</ref> This assumes that the physician has no reason to expect that the patient has an underlying problem.<ref name="NICEback"/> In most cases, the pain goes away naturally after a few weeks.<ref name="NICEback"/> Research has shown that typical patients who do seek diagnosis through imaging are not likely to have a better outcome than patients who wait for the condition to resolve.<ref name="NICEback"/><ref name="ACRlowback">{{Citation |author=National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care |title =ACR Appropriateness Criteria low back pain |publisher = [[American College of Radiology]] |work=[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] |date=January 13, 2011 |publication-place = |page = |url =http://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=35145 |accessdate =9 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="ACPAPSlowback">{{cite PMID|17909209}}</ref>

In cases in which the back pain has a persistent underlying cause, such as a specific disease or spinal abnormality, then it is necessary for the physician to differentiate the source of the pain and advise specific courses of treatment.

==Management==
The management goals when treating back pain are to achieve maximal reduction in pain intensity as rapidly as possible; to restore the individual's ability to function in everyday activities; to help the patient cope with residual pain; to assess for side-effects of therapy; and to facilitate the patient's passage through the legal and socioeconomic impediments to recovery. For many, the goal is to keep the pain to a manageable level to progress with rehabilitation, which then can lead to long term pain relief. Also, for some people the goal is to use non-surgical therapies to manage the pain and avoid major surgery, while for others surgery may be the quickest way to feel better.

Not all treatments work for all conditions or for all individuals with the same condition, and many find that they need to try several treatment options to determine what works best for them. The present stage of the condition ([[acute (medical)|acute]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]]) is also a determining factor in the choice of treatment. Only a minority of back pain patients (most estimates are 1% - 10%) require surgery.

===Pain===
* [[Heat therapy]] is useful for back spasms or other conditions. A [[meta-analysis]] of studies by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that heat therapy can reduce symptoms of acute and sub-acute low-back pain.<ref name=pmid16641776>{{cite journal | author = French S, Cameron M, Walker B, Reggars J, Esterman A | title = A Cochrane review of superficial heat or cold for low back pain | journal = Spine | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 998–1006 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16641776 | doi = 10.1097/01.brs.0000214881.10814.64}}</ref> Some patients find that moist heat works best (e.g. a hot bath or whirlpool) or continuous low-level heat (e.g. a heat wrap that stays warm for 4 to 6 hours). [[Cold compression therapy]] (e.g. ice or cold pack application) may be effective at relieving back pain in some cases.

* Use of [[medication]]s in chronic back pain is controversial. The short term use of [[muscle relaxants]] is effective in the relief of acute back pain.<ref name=pmid12804507>{{cite journal | author = van Tulder M, Touray T, Furlan A, Solway S, Bouter L | title = Muscle relaxants for non-specific low back pain. | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 2| pages = CD004252 | year = 2003| pmid = 12804507 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004252}}</ref> [[Opioids]] have not been shown to be better than placebo for chronic back pain when the risks and benefits are considered.<ref>Deshpande A, Furlan AD, Mailis-Gagnon A, Atlas S, Turk D.

Depending on the particular cause of the condition, [[Human position|posture]] training courses and [[physical exercises]] might help with relieving the pain.

* [[Exercise]]s can be an effective approach to reducing pain, but should be done under supervision of a licensed health professional.

===Surgery===
Surgery may sometimes be appropriate for patients with:
* [[Lumbar disc herniation]] or [[degenerative disc disease]]
* [[Lumbar spinal stenosis]] from [[lumbar disc herniation]], degenerative joint disease, or [[spondylolisthesis]]
* [[Scoliosis]]
* [[Compression fracture]]

Surgery is usually the last resort in the treatment of back pain. It is usually only recommended if all other treatment options have been tried or in an emergency situation. A 2009 systematic review of back surgery studies found that, for certain diagnoses, surgery is moderately better than other common treatments, but the benefits of surgery often decline in the long term.<ref name="pmid19363455">{{cite journal |author=Chou R, Baisden J, Carragee EJ, Resnick DK, Shaffer WO, Loeser JD |title=Surgery for low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society Clinical Practice Guideline |journal=Spine |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=1094–109 |year=2009 |pmid=19363455 |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181a105fc}}</ref>

The main procedures used in back pain surgery are discetomies, spinal fusions, laminectomies, removal of [[tumors]], and vertebroplasties.

There are different types of surgical procedures that are used in treating various conditions causing back pain. Nerve decompression, fusion of body segments and deformity correction surgeries are examples. The first type of surgery is primarily performed in older patients who suffer from conditions causing nerve irritation or [[nerve damage]]. Fusion of bony segments is also referred to as a [[spinal fusion]], and it is a procedure used to fuse together two or more bony fragments with the help of metalwork. The latter type of surgery is normally performed to correct congenital deformities or those that were caused by a traumatic fracture. In some cases, correction of deformities involves removing bony fragments or providing stability provision for the spine. A time-tested procedure to repair common intervertebral disc lesions which offers rapid recovery (just a few days) involves the simple removal of the fibrous nucleus of the affected intervertebral disc.<ref name=Burke2>Burke, G.L., "[http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com/Chapter_7.html Backache from Occiput to Coccyx]" Chapter 9</ref> Various techniques, such as in the following paragraph, are described in the literature.

A discetomy is performed when the intervertebral disc have herniated or torn. It involves removing the protruding disc, either a portion of it or all of it, that is placing [[pressure]] on the [[nerve root]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ehealthmd.com/library/backpain/BAK_surgery.html| title=Surgery For Back Pain|accessdate= June 18, 2010}}</ref> The disc material which is putting pressure on the nerve is removed through a small incision that is made over that particular disc. This is one of the most popular types of back surgeries and which also has a high rate of success. The [[Healing|recovery]] period after this procedure does not last longer than 6 weeks. The type of procedure in which the bony fragments are removed through an [[endoscope]] is called percutaneous disc removal.

Microdiscetomies may be performed as a variation of standard discetomies in which a [[Magnification|magnifier]] is used to provide the advantage of a smaller incision, thus a shorter recovery process.

Spinal fusions are performed in cases in which the patient has had the entire disc removed or when another condition has caused the [[vertebrae]] to become unstable. The procedure consists in uniting two or more vertebrae by using bone grafts and metalwork to provide more strength for the healing bone. Recovery after spinal fusion may take up to one year, depending greatly on the age of the patient, the reason why surgery has been performed and how many bony segments needed to be fused.

In cases of spinal stenosis or disc herniation, laminectomies can be performed to relieve the pressure on the nerves. During such a procedure, the surgeon enlarges the spinal canal by removing or trimming away the [[Lamina of the vertebral arch|lamina]] which will provide more space for the nerves. The severity of the condition as well as the general health status of the patient are key factors in establishing the recovery time, which may be range from 8 weeks to 6 months.

Back surgery can be performed to prevent the growth of benign and malignant tumors. In the first case, surgery has the goal of relieving the pressure from the nerves which is caused by a benign growth, whereas in the latter the procedure is aimed to prevent the spread of cancer to other areas of the body. Recovery depends on the type of tumor that is being removed, the health status of the patient and the size of the tumor.

* [[Cold compression therapy]] is advocated for a strained back or chronic back pain and is postulated to reduce pain and inflammation, especially after strenuous exercise such as golf, gardening, or lifting. However, a [[meta-analysis]] of [[randomized controlled trials]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded "The evidence for the application of cold treatment to low-back pain is even more limited, with only three poor quality studies located. No conclusions can be drawn about the use of cold for low-back pain"<ref name="pmid16641776" />

* Bed rest is rarely recommended as it can exacerbate symptoms,<ref name=pmid20556780>{{cite journal | author = Dahm KT, Brurberg KG, Jamtvedt G, Hagen KB | title = Advice to rest in bed versus advice to stay active for acute low-back pain and sciatica | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 6| pages = CD007612 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20556780 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007612.pub2}}</ref><ref name=pmid15495012>{{cite journal | author = Hagen K, Hilde G, Jamtvedt G, Winnem M | title = Bed rest for acute low-back pain and sciatica | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 4| pages = CD001254 | year = 2004| pmid = 15495012 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001254.pub2}}</ref> and when necessary is usually limited to one or two days. Prolonged bed rest or inactivity is actually counterproductive, as the resulting stiffness leads to more pain.

* [[Electrotherapy]], such as a [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS) has been proposed. Two [[randomized controlled trials]] found conflicting results.<ref name="pmid10084439">{{cite journal |author=Cheing GL, Hui-Chan CW |title=Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation: nonparallel antinociceptive effects on chronic clinical pain and acute experimental pain |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=305–12 |year=1999 |pmid=10084439|doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(99)90142-9}}</ref><ref name="pmid2140432">{{cite journal |author=Deyo RA, Walsh NE, Martin DC, Schoenfeld LS, Ramamurthy S |title=A controlled trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and exercise for chronic low back pain |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=322 |issue=23 |pages=1627–34 |year=1990 |pmid=2140432 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199006073222303}}</ref> This has led the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] to conclude that there is inconsistent evidence to support use of TENS.<ref name="pmid18843638">{{cite journal |author = Khadilkar A, Odebiyi DO, Brosseau L, Wells GA |title = Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) versus placebo for chronic low-back pain |journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue = 4 |pages=CD003008 |year=2008 |pmid=18843638 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003008.pub3}}</ref> In addition, [[Spinal Cord Stimulator|spinal cord stimulation]], where an electrical device is used to interrupt the pain signals being sent to the brain, has been studied for various underlying causes of back pain.{{clarify|it is not clear, because the sentence is poorly structured, whether the studies were looking at: the electrical devices; the pain signals to the brain; underlying causes of back pain; two of these; all three of these.

* [[Inversion therapy]] is useful for temporary back relief due to the traction method or spreading of the vertebrae through (in this case) gravity. The patient hangs in an upside down position for a period of time from ankles or knees until this separation occurs. The effect can be achieved without a complete vertical hang (90 degree) and noticeable benefits can be observed at angles as low as 10 to 45 degrees.<ref>Vidus Vidius. Chirurgia. Cl vi p271. Venice. 1544 (as quoted in the November 1956 issue of the Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England Vol 19, pp269-295)</ref>

==Pregnancy==
About 50% of women experience low back pain during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00007632-199105000-00011 |author=Ostgaard HC, Andersson GB, Karlsson K |title=Prevalence of back pain in pregnancy |journal=Spine |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=549–52 |year=1991 |month=May |pmid=1828912 }}</ref>
Back pain in pregnancy may be severe enough to cause significant pain and disability and pre-dispose patients to back pain in a following pregnancy. No significant increased risk of back pain with pregnancy has been found with respect to maternal weight gain, exercise, work satisfaction, or pregnancy outcome factors such as birth weight, birth length, and Apgar scores.

Biomechanical factors of pregnancy that are shown to be associated with low back pain of pregnancy include abdominal sagittal and transverse diameter and the depth of lumbar lordosis. Typical factors aggravating the back pain of pregnancy include standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting, and walking. Back pain in pregnancy may also be characterized by pain radiating into the thigh and buttocks, night-time pain severe enough to wake the patient, pain that is increased during the night-time, or pain that is increased during the day-time.

The avoidance of high impact, weight-bearing activities and especially those that asymmetrically load the involved structures such as: extensive twisting with lifting, single-leg stance postures, stair climbing, and repetitive motions at or near the end-ranges of back or hip motion can ease the pain.
Direct bending to the ground without bending the knee causes severe impact on the lower back in pregnancy and in normal individuals, which leads to strain, especially in the lumbo-saccral region that in turn strains the multifidus.

==Economics==
Back pain is regularly cited by national governments as having a major impact on [[productivity]], through loss of workers on [[sick leave]]. Some national governments, notably [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], have launched campaigns of public health awareness to help combat the problem, for example the [[Health and Safety Executive]]'s [[Better Backs]] campaign.
In the [[United States]] lower back pain's economic impact reveals that it is the number one reason for individuals under the age of 45 to limit their activity, second highest complaint seen in physician's offices, fifth most common requirement for hospitalization, and the third leading cause for surgery.
