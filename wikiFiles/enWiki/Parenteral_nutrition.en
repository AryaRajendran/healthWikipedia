[[Image:Tpn 3bag.jpg|thumb|Home TPN formula]]
'''Parenteral nutrition''' (PN) is feeding a person [[intravenous]]ly, bypassing the usual process of [[eating]] and [[digestion]]. The person receives nutritional formulae that contain nutrients such as [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, [[lipid]]s and added [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary mineral]]s. It is called '''total parenteral nutrition''' (TPN) or '''total nutrient admixture''' (TNA) when no significant nutrition is obtained by other routes. It may be called  '''total peripheral nutrition'''  (also TPN) when administered through vein access in a limb, rather than through a central port in body.

==Mechanism==
A mechanical pump under computer control is used to dispense the TPN fluid. Pumps are available that allow TPN administration at home, usually with the preparation and attachment by a family member. These pumps operate on an external dispensing line, part of a single-use dispensing cassette. Connection of the dispensing line to the patient is via a valve on a semi-permanent attached venous port whose closure is displaced by a connection on the dispensing line. Preparation, attachment, and valve replacement require care in sanitation and sterile techniques at specific locations. The use of a rechargeable battery and a portable component pack allows a convenient household mobility for many patients during administration periods, these being typically from twelve to sixteen hours a day.

==Indications==
Total [[parenteral]] nutrition (TPN) is provided when the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] is nonfunctional because of an interruption in its continuity (it is blocked, or has a leak - a [[fistula]]) or because its absorptive capacity is impaired.<ref>Kozier, B., & Erb, G., & Berman, A.J., & Burke, K., & Bouchal, S. R., & Hirst, S. P.. (2004). Fundamentals of Nursing: The Nature of Nursing Practice in Canada. Canadian Edition. Prentice Hall Health: Toronto.</ref> It has been used for [[coma]]tose patients, although [[feeding tube|enteral feeding]] is usually preferable, and less prone to complications. Parenteral nutrition is used to prevent malnutrition in patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrients by oral or [[enteral]] routes.<ref>[http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&doc_id=3056&nbr=2282 American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement: parenteral nutrition]</ref>

===Gastrointestinal disorders===
TPN may be the only feasible option for providing nutrition to patients who do not have a functioning gastrointestinal tract or who have disorders requiring complete bowel rest, including [[bowel obstruction]], [[short bowel syndrome]], [[Gastroschisis]], prolonged [[diarrhea]] regardless of its cause, high-output [[fistula]], very severe [[Crohn's disease]] or ulcerative colitis, and certain pediatric GI disorders including congenital GI anomalies.<ref>The Merck Manual, 2008</ref>

===Use in cancer===
The benefit of TPN to [[cancer]] patients is largely debated, and studies to date have generally showed minimal long term benefit. There is no evidence to support the idea that intravenous nutrition 'feeds the cancer, not the patient', but weight loss with advanced disease is significantly more complicated than simply replacing calories as cancer produces a multitude of chemicals that also lead to weight loss, and giving extra nutrition does not prevent this.

==Duration==
Short-term PN may be used if a person's digestive system has shut down (for instance by [[peritonitis]]), and they are at a low enough weight to cause concerns about nutrition during an extended hospital stay. Long-term PN is occasionally used to treat people suffering the extended consequences of an accident, surgery, or digestive disorder. PN has extended the life of children born with nonexistent or severely deformed organs.

==Complications==
TPN is an artificial method of feeding, fully by-passing the GI tract. This unnatural way of feeding the body is far from perfect and comes with several significant complications

===Infection===
TPN requires a chronic IV access for the solution to run through, and the most common complication is infection of this catheter. Infection is a common cause of death in these patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 15% per infection, and death usually results from [[septic shock]].<ref name=Deshpande>{{cite journal|last=Deshpande|first=KS|title=Total parenteral nutrition and infections associated with use of central venous catheters.|journal=American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses|date=2003 Jul|volume=12|issue=4|pages=326–7, 380|pmid=12882062|url=http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/12/4/326.full}}</ref>  Contrary to common belief, evidence suggests that moderate amounts of intravenous lipid rich in linoleic acid are not associated with an increased incidence of bacterial or fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients receiving total parenteral nutrition.<ref name=Lenssen>{{cite journal|title=Intravenous lipid dose and incidence of bacteremia and fungemia in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation|pmid=9583851|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/67/5/927.full.pdf|year=1998|last1=Lenssen|first1=P|last2=Bruemmer|first2=BA|last3=Bowden|first3=RA|last4=Gooley|first4=T|last5=Aker|first5=SN|last6=Mattson|first6=D|volume=67|issue=5|pages=927–33|journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref>

===Blood clots===
Chronic IV access leaves a foreign body in the vascular system, and blood clots on this IV line are common.<ref name=Mollitt>{{cite journal|last=Mollitt|first=DL|coauthors=Golladay ES.|title=Complications of TPN catheter-induced vena caval thrombosis in children less than one year of age|journal=Journal of pediatric surgery|date=1983 Aug|volume=18|issue=4|page=462–7|pmid=6413671|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346883802012|doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(83)80201-2}}</ref>  Death can result from [[pulmonary embolism]] wherein a clot that starts on the IV line but breaks off and goes into the lungs.<ref name=Mailloux>{{cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=RJ|coauthors=DeLegge, MH; Kirby, DF|title=Pulmonary embolism as a complication of long-term total parenteral nutrition|journal=JPEN.

[[Image:Periportal hepatosteatosis intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of [[liver lobule|periportal]] [[fatty liver]] as may arise due to '''TPN'''. [[Trichrome stain]].]]

Patients under long-term TPN will typically receive a periodic [[heparin]] flush to dissolve such clots before they become dangerous.

===Fatty liver and liver failure===
Fatty liver is usually a more long term complication of TPN, though over a long enough course it is fairly common. The pathogenesis is due to using linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid component of soybean oil) as a major source of calories.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of OMEGAVEN 10%® (n-3 EFA Lipid Emulsion) in Home Parenteral Nutrition-associated Liver Disease (MEGANORM)|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01284049|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>

Complications are either related to catheter insertion, or metabolic, including [[refeeding syndrome]]. Catheter complications include pneumothorax, accidental arterial puncture, and catheter-related sepsis. The complication rate at the time of insertion should be less than 5%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McGee DC, Gould MK |title=Preventing complications of central venous catheterization |journal=N.

|url=}}</ref> Metabolic complications include the refeeding syndrome characterised by [[hypokalemia]], [[hypophosphatemia]] and [[hypomagnesemia]]. [[Hyperglycemia]] is common at the start of therapy, but can be treated with insulin added to the TPN solution. Hypoglycaemia is likely to occur with abrupt cessation of TPN. Liver dysfunction can be limited to a reversible cholestatic jaundice and to fatty infiltration (demonstrated by elevated transaminases). Severe hepatic dysfunction is a rare complication.<ref>G. Edward Morgan, Jr., Maged S. Mikhail, Michael J. MurrayClinical Anesthesiology, 4th Edition</ref> Overall, patients receiving TPN have a higher rate of infectious complications. This can be related to hyperglycemia.<ref name=McCowen>{{cite journal|title=Hypocaloric total parenteral nutrition: effectiveness in prevention of hyperglycemia and infectious complications--a randomized clinical trial|pmid=11098961|url=http://pdfs.journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/2000/11000/00007.pdf|year=2000|last1=McCowen|first1=KC|last2=Friel|first2=C|last3=Sternberg|first3=J|last4=Chan|first4=S|last5=Forse|first5=RA|last6=Burke|first6=PA|last7=Bistrian|first7=BR|volume=28|issue=11|pages=3606–11|journal=Critical care medicine}}</ref>
TPN was consid-ered to be a dangerous form of therapy. Critical review of the data suggests that, in humans, TPN does not cause mucosal atro-phy or increase bacterial translocation. Increased sepsis with TPN can be ascribed to overfeeding; the dangers of TPN-induced complications have been exaggerated. TPN is an equally effec-tive alternative to EN when a risk of malnutrition is present and EN is not tolerated or when gut failure is present.<ref name=Jeejeebhoy>{{cite journal|last=Jeejeebhoy|first=KN|title=Total parenteral nutrition: potion or poison?|journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition|year=2001|month=Aug|volume=74|issue=2|pages=160–3|pmid=11470715|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/74/2/160.full}}</ref>

==Solutions==
The nutrient solution consists of [[water]] and electrolytes; [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, and lipids; essential [[vitamin]]s, minerals and trace elements are added or given separately. Previously lipid emulsions were given separately but it is becoming more common for a "three-in-one" solution of glucose, proteins, and lipids to be administered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Didier ME, Fischer S, Maki DG |title=Total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=291–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9739032

==Emulsifier==
Only a limited number of emulsifiers is commonly regarded as safe to use for parenteral administration, of which the most important is [[Lecithin]]. Compared with its synthetic alternatives, [[Lecithin]] can be totally biodegraded and metabolised, since it is an integral part of biological membranes, making it virtually non-toxic. Other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys, creating a toxic load. The emulsifier of choice for most fat emulsions used for Parenteral nutrition is a highly purified Egg [[Lecithin]]<ref>[http://www2.chemie.uni-erlangen.de/services/dissonline/data/dissertation/Christoph_Wabel/html/Chapter1.html Lecithin - An Emulsifier for Parenteral Use: TORVS Research Team]</ref> such as Lipova-E120 from [[VAV Life Sciences]] due to its low toxicity and complete integration with cell membranes.<ref>[http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/17/ACF9CFB.pdf Lipid Emulsions as Drug Delivery Systems: Jack Stevens, Pam Mims  and Neil Coles]</ref>

==Total parenteral nutrition==
[[File:LipidHPN.jpg|thumb| right | Prescription lipid parenteral nutrition formulation]]
Solutions for total parenteral nutrition may be customized to individual patient requirements, or standardized solutions may be used. The use of standardized parenteral nutrition solutions is cost effective and may provide better control of serum electrolytes.<ref name=Hayes>{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=EM|coauthors=Cohen KR, Pinard BE,Lauletta J, Ruggiero R.|title=Standardized versusindividually customized parenteral nutrition solutions: a comparison ofserum electrolyte values|journal=P&T|year=2000|volume=25|issue=2|page=78–80, 83, 87|url=http://www.ptcommunity.com/ptjournal/fulltext/25/2/2502078.pdf}}</ref> 
Ideally each patient is assessed individually before commencing on parenteral nutrition, and a team consisting of specialised doctors, nurses, [[clinical pharmacist]]s and [[Registered Dietitian]]s evaluate the patient's individual data and decide what PN formula to use and at what infusion rate.

For energy only, [[intravenous sugar solution]]s with dextrose or glucose are generally used. This is not considered to be parenteral nutrition as it does not prevent malnutrition when used on its own.
Standardized solutions may also differ between developers. Following are some examples of what compositions they may have. The solution for normal patients may be given both centrally and peripherally.

==Individual components==
Individual nutrient components may be added to more precisely adjust the body contents of it. That individual nutrient may, if possible, be infused individually, or it may be injected into a bag of nutrient solution or intravenous fluids ([[volume expander]] solution) that is given to the patient.

Administration of individual components may be more hazardous than administration of pre-mixed solutions such as those used in total parenteral nutrition, because the latter are generally already balanced in regard to e.g. osmolarity and ability to infuse peripherally. For example, incorrect IV administration of concentrated potassium can be lethal, but this is not a danger if the potassium is mixed in TPN solution and diluted.<ref name=RNSH>[http://www.ciap.health.nsw.gov.au/nswtag/publications/guidelines/Postassium/RNSHRyde.pdf Intravenous Potassium Guidelines (ADULTS)] From RNSH Pharmacy Department. Authorised by: Margaret Duguid. Last Modified: June 2006.</ref>

Vitamins may be added to a bulk premixed nutrient immediately before administration, typically in two doses, one fat soluble, the other water soluble, this since the additional vitamins can promote spoilage of stored product.
