In [[anatomy]], the '''atlas''' (C1) is the most superior (first) [[cervical vertebra]] of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]]. 

It is named for the [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], because it supports the globe of the [[head (anatomy)|head]]. 

The atlas is the topmost vertebra, and &ndash; along with the [[Axis (anatomy)|Axis]] &ndash; forms the joint connecting the [[Human skull|skull]] and spine. The atlas and axis are specialized to allow a greater range of motion than normal vertebrae. They are responsible for the nodding and rotation movements of the head.

The [[atlanto-occipital joint]] allows the head to nod up and down on the vertebral column.
The dens acts as a pivot that allows the atlas and attached head to rotate on the axis, side to side.

The Atlas' chief peculiarity is that it has no body, it is ring-like, and consists of an anterior and a posterior arch and two lateral masses. 

The Atlas and Axis are important neurologically because the brain stem extends down to the Axis.

==Anterior arch==
The anterior arch forms about one-fifth of the ring: its anterior surface is convex, and presents at its center the anterior tubercle for the attachment of the ''[[Longus colli]]'' [[muscle]]s and the [[anterior longitudinal ligament]]; posteriorly it is concave, and marked by a smooth, oval or circular facet (''fovea dentis''), for articulation with the [[odontoid process]] (dens) of the axis. 

The upper and lower borders respectively give attachment to the [[anterior atlantooccipital membrane]] and the [[anterior atlantoaxial ligament]]; the former connects it with the [[occipital bone]] above, and the latter with the axis below.<ref>''Gray's Anatomy'', pp. 36–37 (10/27/11)</ref>

==Posterior arch==

The posterior arch forms about two-fifths of the circumference of the ring: it ends behind in the posterior tubercle, which is the [[rudiment (biology)|rudiment]] of a spinous process and gives origin to the ''[[Recti capitis posteriores minores]]'' and the [[ligamentum nuchae]]. The diminutive size of this process prevents any interference with the movements between the atlas and the skull. 

The posterior part of the arch presents above and behind a rounded edge for the attachment of the [[posterior atlantooccipital membrane]], while immediately behind each superior articular process is a groove (''[[sulcus arteriae vertebralis]]''), sometimes converted into a foramen by a delicate bony spiculum which arches backward from the posterior end of the superior articular process. 

This groove represents the superior vertebral notch, and serves for the transmission of the [[vertebral artery]], which, after ascending through the foramen in the transverse process, winds around the lateral mass in a direction backward and medially; it also transmits the [[suboccipital nerve]] (first spinal nerve).  In a common [[anatomic variant]] the [[vertebral artery]] passes through an [[arcuate foramen]].

On the under surface of the posterior arch, behind the articular facets, are two shallow grooves, the inferior vertebral notches. The lower border gives attachment to the [[posterior atlantoaxial ligament]], which connects it with the axis.

==Lateral masses==
The lateral masses are the most bulky and solid parts of the atlas, in order to support the weight of the head. 

Each carries two articular facets, a superior and an inferior. 

* The ''superior facets'' are of large size, oval, concave, and approach each other in front, but diverge behind: they are directed upward, medially, and a little backward, each forming a cup for the corresponding [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]] of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. Not infrequently they are partially subdivided by indentations which encroach upon their margins.

* The ''inferior articular facets'' are circular in form, flattened or slightly convex and directed downward and medially, articulating with the axis, and permitting the rotatory movements of the head.

==Vertebral foramen==
Just below the medial margin of each superior facet is a small tubercle, for the attachment of the [[transverse atlantal ligament]] which stretches across the ring of the atlas and divides the [[vertebral foramen]] into two unequal parts:
* the ''anterior'' or ''smaller'' receiving the [[odontoid process]] of the axis
* the ''posterior'' transmitting the [[spinal cord]] (''medulla spinalis'') and its membranes

This part of the vertebral canal is of considerable size, much greater than is required for the accommodation of the spinal cord.

The [[transverse processes]] are large; they project laterally and downward from the lateral masses, and serve for the attachment of [[muscle]]s which assist in rotating the head. They are long, and their anterior and posterior tubercles are fused into one mass; the foramen transversarium is directed from below, upward and backward.

==Development==
[[Image:Gray104.png|thumb|right|300px|The atlas ossifies from 3 centers.]]
The atlas is usually [[ossification|ossified]] from three centers. 

Of these, one appears in each lateral mass about the seventh week of fetal life, and extends backward; at birth, these portions of bone are separated from one another behind by a narrow interval filled with [[cartilage]]. 

Between the third and fourth years they unite either directly or through the medium of a separate center developed in the cartilage. 

At birth, the anterior arch consists of cartilage; in this a separate center appears about the end of the first year after birth, and joins the lateral masses from the sixth to the eighth year.  

The lines of union extend across the anterior portions of the superior articular facets. 

Occasionally there is no separate center, the anterior arch being formed by the forward extension and ultimate junction of the two lateral masses; sometimes this arch is ossified from two centers, one on either side of the middle line.

==Injuries==
A break in the first vertebra is referred to as a [[Jefferson fracture]].

The pharyngeal and retropharyngeal inflammations may cause decalcification of atlas vertebra. This may lead to loosening of attachments of transverse ligament which may eventually yield. This allows the [[Dens (anatomy)|dens]] of axis to move and exert pressure on spinal cord causing sudden death.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}
