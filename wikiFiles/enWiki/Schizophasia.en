In the [[mental health]] field, '''schizophasia''', commonly referred to as [[word salad]], is confused, and often repetitious, language that is symptomatic of various [[mental illness]]es.<ref>Berrios G.E. (1999) Falret, SÃ©glas, Morselli and Masselon, and the "Language of the Insane": a conceptual history. ''Brain and Language'' 69: 56-75.</ref>   

It is usually associated with a [[mania|manic]] presentation and other symptoms of serious mental illnesses, such as [[psychosis]], including [[schizophrenia]].  It is characterized by an apparently confused usage of [[word]]s with no apparent meaning or relationship attached to them. In this context, it is considered to be a symptom of a [[formal thought disorder]]. In some cases schizophasia can be a sign of asymptomatic schizophrenia; e.g. the question "Why do people believe in [[God]]?" could elicit a response consisting of a series of words commonly associated with religion or [[prayer]] but strung together with no regard to language rules.

Schizophasia should be contrasted with another symptom of cognitive disruption and [[cognitive slippage]] involving certain idiosyncratic arrangements of words. With this symptom, the language may or may not be grammatically correct depending on the severity of the disease and the particular mechanisms which have been impacted by the disease. 

The American diagnostic codes, from the [[DSM-IV]], do not specifically code for this disorder although they include it as a symptom under the diagnosis of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] |edition=4th edition |year=1994}}</ref>
