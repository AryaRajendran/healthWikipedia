'''Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome''' or Imerslund-Najman-Grasbeck syndrome or Imerslund-Grasbeck disease (IGS or INGS) is an autosomal recessive, familial form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency caused by malfunction of the receptor located in the terminal ileum. This receptor is referred to as "Cubam", and is composed of two proteins, [[amnionless]] (AMN), and [[cubilin]]. Defect in either of these protein components can cause this syndrome. This is a rare disease (prevalence about 1 in 200,000),<ref name=Grasbeck2006/> and a rare form of macrocytic, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient anemia, and is usually seen in patients of European ancestry.

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is an important vitamin needed for bone marrow functioning, the deficit of which causes decreased marrow output and anemia. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> has two forms, one of which, along with folate, is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is sensitive to acid deformation in the stomach, so a molecule called [[haptocorrin]] (R-factor), protects it in the stomach. In the small bowel, a molecule named [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), allows vitamin B<sub>12</sub> to be absorbed in the ileum. IGS is caused by a mutation in the receptors located in the terminal portion of ileum. This is a very rare, and unlikely cause of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency but is a cause nonetheless.

==Signs and symptoms==
Defined as those seen in any macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia:
*[[Anemia]]: causing fatigue, conjuctival palor, pale complexion, and in some cases, a mild icterus (yellowing of the eye).
*[[Glossitis]] ("shiny tongue"): shiny, glossy tongue.
*[[Cheilosis]] (stomatitis): Inflammation of the edges of the lips and the oral mucosa.
*[[Tabes dorsalis]] ("subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord"): This involves the posterior section of the spinal cord and therefore involves [[proprioception]] (sense of position), touch, sense of vibration and in severe cases the [[lateral corticospinal tract]], causing spastic paralysis of the limbs.
*Peripheral [[neuropathy]]: tingling sensation in the arms and legs.
*[[Pancytopenia]]: decreased number of blood cells of all lineages (RBCs,leucocytes,platelets), due to decreased bone marrow production.
*[[Methylmalonyl CoA-emia]]: defined as blood having and unusually high concentration of [[methylmalonyl CoA]].
*Peripheral findings such as [[hypersegmented neutrophils]] and large RBCs on high field view of the blood smears.
*Laboratory findings indicating increased [[MCV]] (Mean Corpuscular Volume), decreased [[Hgb]]/[[Hct]] (indicating anemia), and decreased value of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in the blood.
*Proteinuria: protein found in the urine detected by analysis or by [[dipstick]].
*Reversal of all symptoms except neurological symptoms, by IV injection of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.
*[[Schilling test]] indicating <u>no</u> radioactive vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in the urine. (This test has dropped out of favor and should not be tried in patients with any form of renal failure).

==Genetics==
The disease is autosomal recessive, and can therefore skip generations. Mutations in either amnionless (AMN) or cubilin can be the culprit. The suspected chromosome is 14.<ref name=Grasbeck2006/> Due to its autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, affected individuals (persons possessing a [[homozygous]] [[recessive]] [[genotype]]) need to undergo genetic counselling to identify risk of family members who might be [[heterozygous]] [[genetic carrier]]s.

==Pathogenesis==
Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, is an essential water soluble vitamin found in animal products (such as liver, meat, fish, and dairy products).<ref name=EssHaem>{{cite book |author=Pettit, John D.; Paul Moss |title=Essential Haematology 5e (Essential) |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Professional| year=2006 |pages=44–6 |isbn=1-4051-3649-9}}</ref> Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is not found in the greens, and therefore one of the principal sources of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is a purely vegan diet. Normal daily intake of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is 7–30&nbsp;micro gram, cooking has minimal effect on the structure of this vitamin. Minimal daily adult requirement is 1–3&nbsp;micro gram, and the human body is able to store at any one time, about 2–3&nbsp;microgram, which is sufficient for at least 2&nbsp;years of impeccable functioning before the source is depleted. In terms of absorption, no more than 2–3&nbsp;microgram of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be absorbed on a daily basis, with some 5–10&nbsp;microgram of the vitamin B<sub>12</sub> involved in [[enterohepatic circulation]].<ref name=EssHaem/> This is in general a principal characteristic of [[water-soluble vitamins]], in that no matter the oral intake, there is a certain threshold for intestinal absorption hence, low or non-existent chance of intoxication, as opposed to [[fat-soluble vitamins]].

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> has a major function in the nuclear replication of the DNA. It is therefore logical that its deficiency causes decrease bone marrow production, one of the most common manifestations of which is decreased red blood cell production or as it is referred to medically, anemia. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> however has two major forms in the human body:
*[[Cobamamide|Deoxyadenosyl B<sub>12</sub>]] or as it is sometimes referred to Ado B<sub>12</sub>: Ado B<sub>12</sub> is essential for acid-base maintenance of the blood, simply because Ado B<sub>12</sub> is the catalyst that assists the conversion of, [[Methylmalonyl CoA]], into [[Succinyl CoA]]. In absence of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, levels of Methylmalonyl CoA increase, and this is in fact a great way to distinguish [[folate]] deficiency macrocytic anemia, from vitamin B<sub>12</sub> anemia. The following is the reaction in which Ado B<sub>12</sub>, plays a pivotal role:

Propionyl CoA → Methylmalonyl CoA → Succinyl CoA <ref name=EssHaem/> 

*[[Methyl B12]]: This form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is essential for conversion of Methy-THF ([[methyl tetrahydrofolate]]) into THF, and methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>). The methyl group, is then used to add a carbon, to [[homocysteine]], converting it into [[Methionine]]. Methionine is further converted to S-adenosyl methionine, which in turn gives of the extra carbon it received from THF, now to a DNA nucleotide, becoming S-adenosyl homcysteine. S-adenosyl Homocysteine, further loses its "S-adenosyl" attachment, to become homocysteine, and the cycle repeats yet again!
                                            
                               Methyl THF → CH<sub>3</sub> + THF
                                             ↓                       
                                Homocysteine → Methionine
                        S-adenosyl ← ↑              ↓ ← S-adenosyl
                      S-adenosyl Homocysteine ← S-adenosyl Methionine
                                              ↓
                                             CH<sub>3</sub>
                                              ↓ 
                                          DNA → Methyl-DNA

It is therefore understood that vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is involved in complex DNA synthesis, along with folate, as well as in acid-base metabolism. To understand the basic pathophysiology of Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, it is imperative to understand the absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. The following lists principal events that lead to absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> along the [[GI tract]]:
*[[Oral cavity]]: vitamin B<sub>12</sub> containing food is ingested. Salivary glands produce [[haptocorrin]], which binds vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, creating a "vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-Haptocorrin complex". This complex is then ingested via esophageal peristalsis into the stomach.
*[[Stomach]]: vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-Haptocorrin, survives the low pH, highly osmotic environment of the stomach. [[Parietal cells]] produce hydrochloric acid (the effect of which Haptocorrin protects vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from), and also [[intrinsic factor]] (IF). Intrinsic factor also has a high binding affinity for vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, but because that position is already filled by Haptocorrin, free intrinsic factor, and "Haptocorrin-vitamin B<sub>12</sub>" complex, empty from the stomach into the duodenum.
*[[duodenum]]: [[Pancreatic juice]], produced by the pancreas, contains pancreatic proteases that break the haptocorrin, degrading it and freeing the vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Once free, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, binds with intrinsic factor (IF), to produce an "IF-vitamin B<sub>12</sub>" complex.
*[[Ileum]]: Located in the terminal portion of the ileum is a specialized receptor complex called the [[cubam]] (or sometimed called "CUBN"). Cubam is composed of two molecules, one of which is [[amnionless]] (AMN), and the other [[cubilin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pedersen GA, Chakraborty S, Steinhauser AL, Traub LM, Madsen M |title=AMN directs endocytosis of the intrinsic factor-vitamin B(12) receptor cubam by engaging ARH or Dab2 |journal=Traffic |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=706–20 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20088845 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01042.x |pmc=2964065}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Quadros EV |title=Advances in the understanding of cobalamin assimilation and metabolism |journal=Br.

Haematol. |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=195–204 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=19832808 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07937.x |pmc=2809139}}</ref> Cubilin specializes in recognition of the "vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-IF" complex and attaches it, while amnionless (AMN), is responsible for initiation of the endocytosis of complex, result of which is absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. It is at this point, where the IGS syndrome causes its pathology, by preventing absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> due to a defective cubam receptor, due to mutation in either the amnionless (AMN) portion, or the cubilin portion.<ref name=Grasbeck2006>{{cite journal | author=Grasbeck R | title=Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (selective vitamin B<sub>12</sub> malabsorption with proteinuria | journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-17 | year=2006 | volume=1 | page=17 | pmid=16722557 |pmc=1513194}}</ref> Mutation at either cubilin, or AMN, can cause this syndrome.

==Treatment==
Since the essential pathology is due to the inability to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from the bowels, the solution is therefore injection of IV vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Timing is essential, as some of the side effects of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are reversible (such as RBC indices, peripheral RBC smear findings such as hypersegmented neutrophils, or even high levels of methylmalonyl CoA), but some side effects are irreversible as they are of a neurological source (such as tabes dorsalis, and peripheral neuropathy). High suspicion should be exercised when a neonate, or a pediatric patient presents with anemia, proteinuria, sufficient vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary intake, and no signs of [[pernicious anemia]].

==History==
The syndrome is the result of the collective work done by a Norwegian pediatrician, [[Olga Imerslund]],<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3101.html "Who named it --Olga Imerslund"]</ref> a Finnish physician and clinical biochemist, [[Armas Ralph Gustaf Gräsbeck]],<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3103.html "Who named it --Armas Ralph Gustaf Gräsbeck"]</ref> and [[Emil Najman]], a pediatrician from Croatia.<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3102.html "Who named it --Emil Najman"]</ref>
