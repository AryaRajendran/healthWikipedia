'''Type IV [[hypersensitivity]]''' is often called '''delayed type hypersensitivity''' as the reaction takes two to three days to develop. Unlike the other types, it is not antibody mediated but rather is a type of '''cell-mediated''' response.

CD4+ [[helper T cell]]s recognize antigen in a complex with Class 2 [[major histocompatibility complex]]. The antigen-presenting cells in this case are macrophages that secrete [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]], which stimulates the proliferation of further CD4+ T<sub>h</sub>1 cells. CD4+ T cells secrete [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] and [[interferon]] gamma, further inducing the release of other T<sub>h</sub>1 cytokines, thus mediating the immune response. Activated CD8+ T cells destroy target cells on contact, whereas activated macrophages produce [[hydrolytic enzyme|hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s and, on presentation with certain intracellular pathogens, transform into multinucleated [[giant cell]]s.

The pathophysiology of the Tuberculin reaction is explained thus: ''M. tuberculosis'' are engulfed by macrophages after being identified as foreign, but due to a self- preserving mechanism peculiar to TB it is able to block the fusion of the phagosome within which it is existing with the [[lysosome]] which would destroy it. So it can continue existing and replicating within the immune cell designed to destroy it. After several weeks, the immune system somehow [mechanism as yet unexplained] ramps up and, on stimulation with [[IFN]]-gamma, the macrophages become capable of killing ''M. tuberculosis'' by forming phagolysosomes and nitric oxide radicals. However unfortunately the hyper-activated macrophages secrete [[TNF]] which recruits multiple [[monocytes]] into the battle. These cells differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes which wall off the infected cells, but at the cost of significant inflammation and local damage.
