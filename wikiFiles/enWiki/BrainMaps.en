'''BrainMaps''' is an [[NIH]]-funded interactive zoomable high-resolution digital brain atlas and [[virtual microscopy| virtual microscope]] that is based on more than 20 million megapixels (60 terabytes) of scanned images of serial sections of both primate and non-primate [[brain]]s and that is integrated with a high-speed [[database]] for querying and retrieving data about brain structure and function over the internet.     [[Image:Brainmaps4.jpg|thumb|200px|Datasets as a function of species at BrainMaps]] Currently featured are complete brain atlas datasets for [[Macaca mulatta]], [[Chlorocebus aethiops]], [[Felis silvestris catus]], [[Mus musculus]], [[Rattus norvegicus]], and [[Tyto alba]]. 

BrainMaps uses multiresolution image formats for representing massive brain images, and a dHTML/Javascript front-end user interface for image navigation, both similar to the way that [[Google Maps]] works for geospatial data.

BrainMaps is one of the most massive online neuroscience databases and image repositories and features the highest-resolution whole brain atlas ever constructed.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mikula | first = S | coauthors = Trotts I, Stone JM, Jones EG | date = 2007 | title = Internet-Enabled High-Resolution Brain Mapping and Virtual Microscopy | journal = NeuroImage | pmid = 17229579 | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.053 | pmc = 1890021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Mikula | first = S | coauthors = Stone JM, Jones EG | date = 2008 | title = BrainMaps.org - Interactive High-Resolution Digital Brain Atlases and Virtual Microscopy | journal = Brains Minds Media | pmid = 19129928 | volume = 3 | pages = bmm1426 | pmc = 2614326 }}</ref>
