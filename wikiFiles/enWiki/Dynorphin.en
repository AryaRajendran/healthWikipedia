'''Dynorphins''' are a class of [[opioid peptides]] that arise from the precursor [[protein]] [[prodynorphin]].  When prodynorphin is cleaved during processing by [[proprotein convertase 2]] (PC2), multiple active peptides are released: [[dynorphin A]], [[dynorphin B]], and [[α-neo-endorphin|α]]/[[β-neo-endorphin]].<ref name="pmid9422738">{{cite journal | author = Day R, Lazure C, Basak A, Boudreault A, Limperis P, Dong W, Lindberg I | title = Prodynorphin processing by proprotein convertase 2.

Dynorphin A, dynorphin B, and [[big dynorphin]] all contain a high proportion of basic amino acid residues, in particular lysine and arginine (29.4%, 23.1%, and 31.2% basic residues, respectively), as well as many hydrophobic residues (41.2%, 30.8%, and 34.4% hydrophobic residues, respectively).<ref name="pmid15894804">{{cite journal | author = Marinova Z, Vukojevic V, Surcheva S, Yakovleva T, Cebers G, Pasikova N, Usynin I, Hugonin L, Fang W, Hallberg M, Hirschberg D, Bergman T, Langel U, Hauser KF, Pramanik A, Aldrich JV, Gräslund A, Terenius L, Bakalkin G | title = Translocation of dynorphin neuropeptides across the plasma membrane.

The first clues to the functionality of dynorphins came from Goldstein et al.<ref name="Goldstein1">{{cite journal | author = Goldstein A, Tachibana S, Lowney LI, Hunkapiller M, Hood L | title = Dynorphin-(1-13), an extraordinarily potent opioid peptide | journal = Proc.

The group discovered an endogenous opioid peptide in the porcine pituitary that proved difficult to isolate.  By sequencing the first 13 amino acids of the peptide, they created a synthetic version of the peptide with a similar potency to the natural peptide.  Goldstein et al.<ref name="Goldstein1"/> applied the synthetic peptide to the guinea ileum longitudinal muscle and found it to be an extraordinarily potent opioid peptide.  The peptide was called dynorphin (from the Greek dynamis=power) to describe its potency.<ref name="Goldstein1"/>

Dynorphins exert their effects primarily through the [[κ-opioid receptor]] (KOR), a [[G-protein-coupled receptor]].  Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1 and K2.<ref name="Nyberg"/>  Although KOR is the primary receptor for all dynorphins, the peptides do have some affinity for the [[μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR), [[δ-opioid receptor]] (DOR), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ([[NMDA]])-type glutamate receptor <ref name="Drake"/><ref name="Lai">{{cite journal | author = Lai J, Luo MC, Chen Q, Ma S, Gardell LR, Ossipov MH, Porreca F | title = Dynorphin A activates bradykinin receptors to maintain neuropathic pain | journal = Nat.

==Production==
Dynorphin is produced in many different parts of the brain, including the [[hypothalamus]], the [[striatum]], the [[hippocampus]] and the [[spinal cord]]. Gene expression patterns from the [[Allen Brain Atlas]]es in mouse, macaque and humans can be seen [http://www.brain-map.org/search/index.html?query=pdyn here].

Dynorphin has many different physiological actions, depending upon its site of production.
* For example, dynorphin that is made in magnocellular [[vasopressin]] neurons of the [[supraoptic nucleus]] is important in the patterning of electrical activity. Dynorphin produced in magnocellular [[oxytocin]] neurons is a [[negative feedback]] inhibitor of [[oxytocin]] secretion.
* Dynorphin produced in the [[arcuate nucleus]] and in [[orexin]] neurons of the [[lateral hypothalamus]] affects the control of [[appetite]].

==Analgesia==
Dynorphin has been shown to be a modulator of pain response.  Han and Xie found that injecting dynorphin into the subarachnoid space of the rat spinal cord produced dose-dependent analgesia that was measured by tail-flick latency.<ref name="Han">{{cite journal | author = Han JS, Xie CW | title = Dynorphin: potent analgesic effect in spinal cord of the rat | journal = Sci.

Han and Xie found dynorphin to be 6-10 times more potent than [[morphine]] on a per mole basis.<ref name="Han"/> In addition, morphine tolerance did not reduce dynorphin-induced analgesia.<ref name="Han"/>  Ren et al. demonstrated some of the complexities related to dynorphin induced analgesia.<ref name="Ren">{{cite journal | author = Ren MF, Lu CH, Han JS | title = Dynorphin-A-(1-13) antagonizes morphine analgesia in the brain and potentiates morphine analgesia in the spinal cord | journal = Peptides | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 1015–20 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2871545 | doi = 10.1016/0196-9781(85)90423-1| url =  }}</ref> The authors found that combining subanalgesic levels of morphine and dynorphin A<sub>1-13</sub>, a version of dynorphin A containing only the first 13 amino acids of the peptide, in the rat spinal cord had additive effects.  However, when dynorphin A<sub>1-13</sub> was injected into the intracerebroventriulcar (ICV) region of the brain, it had an antagonist effect on morphine-induced analgesia.

A study by Lai et al. found that dynorphin might actually stimulate pain.<ref name="Lai"/> The group found that it acts on the bradykinin receptor as well as KOR. The N-terminal tyrosine of dynorphin A is necessary to activate opioid receptors such as KOR, but is unnecessary in binding to bradykinin receptors.<ref name="Lai"/> Lai et al. studied the effects of dynorphin A<sub>2-13</sub> that did not contain the N-terminal tyrosine. Based on the results of dynorphin A<sub>2-13</sub>, the authors proposed a mechanism in which dynorphin A activates bradykinin receptors and thus stimulates pain response.<ref name="Lai"/> 

According to this mechanism, dynorphin activates bradykinin receptors, which triggers the release of calcium ions into the cell through voltage-sensitive channels in the cell membrane.<ref name="Lai"/> Blocking bradykinin receptors in the lumbar region of the spinal cord reversed persistent pain.<ref name="Lai"/> A multiple pathway system might help explain the conflicting effects of dynorphin in the CNS.

Svensson et al. provided another possible mechanism by which dynorphin might cause pain in the spinal cord.<ref name="Svensson2005">{{cite journal | author = Svensson CI, Hua XY, Powell HC, Lai J, Porreca F, Yaksh TL | title = Prostaglandin E2 release evoked by intrathecal dynorphin is dependent on spinal p38 mitogen activated protein kinase | journal = Neuropeptides | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 485–94 | year = 2005 | month = October | pmid = 16176831 | doi = 10.1016/j.npep.2005.08.002 | url =  }}</ref> The authors found that administration of truncated dynorphin A<sub>2-17</sub>, which does not bind to opioid receptors, causes an increase in phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in [[microglia]] in the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] of the spinal cord. Activated p38 has been previously linked to the NMDA-evoked [[prostaglandin]] release, which causes pain.<ref name="Svensson2003">{{cite journal | author = Svensson CI, Hua XY, Protter AA, Powell HC, Yaksh TL | title = Spinal p38 MAP kinase is necessary for NMDA-induced spinal PGE(2) release and thermal hyperalgesia | journal = Neuroreport | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 1153–7 | year = 2003 | month = June | pmid = 12821799 |url=http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2003/06110/Spinal_p38_MAP_kinase_is_necessary_for.10.aspx | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200306110-00010 }}</ref> Thus, dynorphin could also induce pain in the spinal cord through a non-opioid p38 pathway.

==Addiction==
Cocaine addiction results from complex molecular changes in the brain following multiple exposures to cocaine.<ref name="Nestler">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ, Aghajanian GK | title = Molecular and cellular basis of addiction | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5335 | pages = 58–63 | year = 1997 | month = October | pmid = 9311927 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5335.58| url =  }}</ref> Dynorphins have been shown to be an important part of this process. Although a single exposure to cocaine does not affect brain dynorphin levels, repeated exposures to the drug increases dynorphin concentrations in the [[striatum]] and [[substantia nigra]] in rats.<ref name="Sivam">{{cite journal | author = Sivam SP | title = Cocaine selectively increases striatonigral dynorphin levels by a dopaminergic mechanism | journal = J.

One proposed molecular mechanism for increased dynorphin levels involves transcriptional regulation by [[CREB]] (3’, 5’-monophosphate response element binding protein). According to the model proposed by Carlezon et al., use of cocaine increases the expression of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and cAMP-dependent protein kinase ([[Protein kinase A|PKA]]).<ref name="Carlezon">{{cite journal | author = Carlezon WA, Thome J, Olson VG, Lane-Ladd SB, Brodkin ES, Hiroi N, Duman RS, Neve RL, Nestler EJ | title = Regulation of cocaine reward by CREB | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5397 | pages = 2272–5 | year = 1998 | month = December | pmid = 9856954 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5397.2272| url =  }}</ref> PKA leads to the activation of CREB, which increases the expression of dynorphin in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, brain areas important in addiction.<ref name="Carlezon"/> Dynorphin decreases [[dopamine]] release by binding to KORs on dopamine nerve terminals,<ref name="Krebs">{{cite journal | author = Krebs MO, Gauchy C, Desban M, Glowinski J, Kemel ML | title = Role of dynorphin and GABA in the inhibitory regulation of NMDA-induced dopamine release in striosome- and matrix-enriched areas of the rat striatum | journal = J.

=== Cocaine ===

Carlezon et al.<ref name="Carlezon"/> performed several experiments to validate this model. They found that, when mice were injected with cocaine, they preferred to be in the place where they were injected (showed stronger place preference) significantly more than control mice (injected with saline) did.  However, in mice overexpressing CREB under a constitutive promoter, place aversion was observed.<ref name="Carlezon"/> This indicates that increasing CREB reverses the positive effects of cocaine.  [[Northern blot]] analysis several days after CREB overexpression showed a marked increase in dynorphin mRNA in the nucleus accumbens.<ref name="Carlezon"/> 

Blocking KORs with an antagonist (norBNI) blocked the aversive effects caused by CREB overexpression.<ref name="Carlezon"/> Thus, cocaine use ultimately appears to lead to an increase in the transcription of prodynorphin mRNA. Dynorphin inhibits dopamine release,<ref name="You">{{cite journal | author = You ZB, Herrera-Marschitz M, Terenius L | title = Modulation of neurotransmitter release in the basal ganglia of the rat brain by dynorphin peptides | journal = J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. | volume = 290 | issue = 3 | pages = 1307–15 | year = 1999 | month = September | pmid = 10454508 | doi = | url =  }}</ref> that would counter the pleasurable effects of cocaine caused by the release of dopamine.<ref name="Clavin">{{cite web | url = http://dynorphin.com/ | title = Dynorphin : Nature's own antidote to cocaine ( and pleasure? ) | author = Clavin W | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2002-04-14 | work = | publisher = | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-07-10}}</ref> 

There is also evidence suggesting that increased amounts of dynorphin can protect humans from cocaine addiction. According to research at Rockefeller University, the gene for dynorphin is present in two versions: a “high output” and a “low output” functional variation.<ref name=Clavin/> The high output functional variation of the gene contains polymorphisms in the promoter regions that are speculated to cause it to produce more copies of dynorphin mRNA, which would give people carrying this variation a “built-in defense system” against drug addiction.<ref name=Clavin/>

==Stress and depression==
Land et al. first described a mechanism of dysphoria in which [[corticotropin-releasing factor]] (CRF) provokes dynorphin release.<ref name="Land">{{cite journal | author = Land BB, Bruchas MR, Lemos JC, Xu M, Melief EJ, Chavkin C | title = The Dysphoric Component of Stress Is Encoded by Activation of the Dynorphin κ-Opioid System | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–14 | year = 2008 | month = January | pmid = 18184783 | pmc = 2612708 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4458-07.2008 | url =  }}</ref> While control mice displayed aversive behaviors in response to forced swim tests and foot shocks, mice lacking dynorphin did not show any such signs of aversion. They noted that injecting CRF led to aversive behaviors in mice with functional genes for dynorphin even in the absence of stress, but not in those with dynorphin gene deletions. Place aversion was eliminated when the receptor CRF2 was blocked with an antagonist.<ref name=Land/> 

Together these results led Land et al. to conclude that dysphoric elements of stress occur when CRF2 stimulates dynorphin release and activates KOR.<ref name=Land/> The group further postulated that this pathway might be involved in drug seeking behavior. In support of this, it was shown previously that stress can reinstate cocaine-seeking behavior in mice through a CRF mechanism.<ref name="pmid15930388">{{cite journal | author = Wang B, Shaham Y, Zitzman D, Azari S, Wise RA, You ZB | title = Cocaine experience establishes control of midbrain glutamate and dopamine by corticotropin-releasing factor: a role in stress-induced relapse to drug seeking | journal = J.

Overexpression of dominant negative CREB (mCREB) in transgenic mice had an antidepressant effect (in terms of behavior), whereas overexpressing wild-type CREB caused an increase in depression-like symptoms.<ref name=Newton/> As described previously, CREB increases transcription of prodynorphin, which gives rise to different dynorphin subtypes.<ref name=Carlezon/> Newton et al.<ref name=Newton/> supported this mechanism, as the mCREB was colocalized with decreased expression of prodynorphin.  Also, direct antagonism of dynorphin caused antidepressant-like effects similar to those seen with mCREB expression.<ref name=Newton/> Thus, the CREB-dynorphin pathway regulates mood as well as cocaine rewards.

Shirayama et al.<ref name=Shirayama/> concluded that both dynorphins A and B were important in stress response. The authors proposed several mechanisms to account for the effects of the KOR antagonist norBNI on learned helplessness. First, increased dynorphin levels block the release of [[glutamate]], a neurotransmitter involved in [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] in the hippocampus, which would inhibit new learning.<ref name=Shirayama/> 

Blocking dynorphin effects would allow glutamate to be released and restore functional plasticity in the hippocampus, reversing the phenomenon of learned helplessness. In addition, blocking dynorphin would enhance dopamine signaling and thus reduce depressive symptoms associated with stress.<ref name=Shirayama/> The authors suggest that KOR antagonists might have potential in treating depression in humans.

==Appetite and circadian rhythms==
Dynorphins are important in maintaining [[homeostasis]] through appetite control and [[circadian rhythms]].

The group found that while food did not alter the expression of dynorphin B, it increases dynorphin A levels in several rat brain regions ([[hypothalamus]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis).

Recent research on dynorphin [[knockout mice]] did not find differences between knockout and control animals in food intake, but found that fat storage was reduced in male knockout mice.<ref name="Sainsbury">{{cite journal | author = Sainsbury A, Lin S, McNamara K, Slack K, Enriquez R, Lee NJ, Boey D, Smythe GA, Schwarzer C, Baldock P, Karl T, Lin EJ, Couzens M, Herzog H | title = Dynorphin knockout reduces fat mass and increases weight loss during fasting in mice | journal = Mol.

Studies have also shown that ingesting a high-fat diet increases the gene expression of dynorphin in the hypothalamus.<ref name="Leib">{{cite journal | author = Leibowitz SF | title = Overconsumption of dietary fat and alcohol: Mechanisms involving lipids and hypothalamic peptides | journal = Physiol.

In their study, mice had their tails pinched (causes stress), which induced eating. Stress-related eating was reduced by injecting naloxone, an opioid peptide antagonist.<ref name=MorleyL/> 

Mandenoff et al.<ref name=Man/> proposed that, although endogenous opioids are not necessary to maintain body weight and energy expenditure under predictable circumstances, they become activated under stressful conditions. They found that endogenous opioids, such as dynorphin, stimulate appetite and decrease energy expenditure. Taken together, the studies above suggest an important evolutionary mechanism in which more food is eaten, more nutrients are stored, and less energy is expended by an organism during times of stress.

==Temperature regulation==
In addition to their role in weight control, dynorphins have been found to regulate body temperature.  Opioid peptides were first investigated in [[hyperthermia]], where it was found that MOR agonists stimulate this response when injected into the periaqueductal gray (PAG) region of the brain.<ref name=Nyberg/> Xin et al.<ref name="Xin">{{cite journal | author = Xin L, Geller EB, Adler MW | title = Body temperature and analgesic effects of selective mu and kappa opioid receptor agonists microdialyzed into rat brain | journal = J.

The authors found that the severity of [[hypothermia]] was proportional to the dose of dynorphin A<sub>1-17</sub> administered.  Hypothermia could be prevented by administering KOR antagonist norBNI to the rat.<ref name=Xin/> Xin et al.<ref name=Xin/> hypothesized that while MOR agonists mediate hyperthermia, KOR agonists, such as dynorphin, mediate hypothermia.

Further, authors found that administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors reduced dynorphin A1-17 levels in the brain and attenuated symptoms related to heat stress.  Sharma and Alm<ref name=Sharma/> concluded that hyperthermia increases dynorphin levels, which may cause damage and promote heat stress reaction.  They further hypothesized that [[nitric oxide]] was part of this mechanism.

The authors applied a KOR agonist to K1 knockout mice, which eliminated hypothermic response.  Thus, K2 does not appear to have a role in the hypothermic mechanism

==Clinical significance==
Recent research has demonstrated that pulmonary delivery may be an effective means of distributing dynorphin derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brugos B, Arya V, Hochhaus G |title=Stabilized dynorphin derivatives for modulating antinociceptive activity in morphine tolerant rats: effect of different routes of administration |journal=AAPS J |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=e36 |year=2004 |pmid=15760101 |doi=10.1208/aapsj060436}}</ref>
