'''Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs)''' are aggregates of [[phosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]] [[tau (protein)|tau protein]] that are most commonly known as a primary marker of [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. Their presence is also found in numerous other diseases known as [[tauopathies]]. Little is known about their exact relationship to the different pathologies.

==Formation==
Neurofibrillary tangles are formed by [[phosphorylation|hyperphosphorylation]] of a [[microtubule]]-associated [[protein]] known as [[tau (protein)|tau]], causing it to aggregate, or group, in an insoluble form. (These aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are also referred to as [[Paired Helical Filaments|PHF]], or "[[paired helical filament]]s"). The precise mechanism of tangle formation is not completely understood, and it is still controversial whether tangles are a primary causative factor in disease or play a more peripheral role.

===Cytoskeletal changes===
Three different maturation states of NFT have been defined using  anti-tau and anti-[[ubiquitin]] [[immunostaining]]. At stage 0 there are morphologically normal [[pyramidal cell]]s showing diffuse or fine granular [[cytoplasmic]] staining with anti-tau. In other words cells are healthy with minimal tau presence; at stage 1 some delicate elongate [[Inclusion bodies|inclusions]] are stained by tau [[antibodies]] (these are early tangles); stage 2 is represented by the classic NFT demonstration with anti-tau staining ; stage 3 is exemplified by ghost tangles (tangles outside of cells where the host [[neuron]] has died), which are characterized by a reduced anti-tau but marked anti-ubiquitin immunostaining.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bancher C, Brunner C, Lassmann H, Budka H, Jellinger K, Wiche G, Seitelberger F, Grundke-Iqbal I, Wisniewski HM ''et al.'' | year = 1989 | title = Accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated x precedes the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Brain Res | volume = 477 | issue = 1–2| pages = 90–99 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(89)91396-6 | pmid = 2495152 }}</ref>

==Causes==
[[image:TANGLES HIGH.jpg|thumb|right|Upright|Diagram of how microtubules disintegrate with Alzheimer's disease]]

===Mutated Tau===
The traditional understanding is that tau binds to [[microtubules]] and assists with their formation and stabilization. However when tau is hyperphosphorylated, it is unable to bind and the microtubules become unstable and begin disintegrating. The unbound tau clumps together in formations called neurofibrillary tangles.<ref name="Lee"/> More explicitly, intracellular lesions known as pretangles develop when tau is phosphorylated excessively and on improper [[amino acid]] residues. These lesions, over time, develop into [[protein filament|filamentous]] neurofibrilary tangles (NFTs) which interfere with numerous intracellular functions. Seeking a reliable animal model for tau-related pathologies, researchers expressed the human mutant P301L tau [[gene]] in adult mice. This experiment resulted in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and pretangle formations. The human mutant P301 tau gene is associated with frontotemporal [[dementia]] with parkinsonism, another tauopathy associated with NFTs. It was found that the degree of tau pathology was dependent on time and the level of gene expression.<ref name="Klein"/> Groups receiving a combination of a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] in the [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] saw increased tau expression, as early as 3 weeks after vector injection, which was measured using a [[Western blot]].<ref name= "Klein"/> These groups also showed a greater pathology compared to those with less expression of the mutant tau. Additionally, NFTs were clearly detected by [[immunoelectron microscopy]] at 4 months but not at 2 months. However, at both 2 and 4 months, pretangle-like structures were observed suggesting the NFT formation is not complete by 4 months and will continue to progress with time.<ref name= "Klein"/>

===Traumatic Brain Injury ===
Preliminary research indicates that iron deposits due to [[hemorrhaging]], following [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), may increase tau [[pathology]]. While TBI does not routinely lead to accelerated NFT formation, further work may determine if other [[List of human blood components|blood components]] or factors unrelated to hemorrhages are involved in this TBI-induced augmentation of tau pathology.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yoshiyama Y., Uryu K., Higuchi M., Longhi L., Hoover R., Fujimoto S. ''et al.'' | year = 2005 | title = Enhanced neurofibrillary tangle formation, [[cerebral atrophy]], and [[cognitive deficits]] induced by repetitive mild brain injury in a [[transgenic]] tauopathy mouse model.

===Aluminum===
The idea that there is a link between [[aluminum]] exposure and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles has floated around the scientific community for sometime without having been definitively proven or disregarded. Recently a study examining the [[hippocampal]] [[Cornu Ammonis area 1|CA1]] cells from individuals with and without Alzheimer’s disease showed a small portion of the pyramidal cells contain [[cytoplasmic]] pools within their [[somas]] containing early NFTs. These cytoplasmic pools are aggregates of an aluminum/hyperphosphorylated tau complex similar to mature NFTs. (Walton) While a connection between aluminum and NFTs and AD is maintained, there is evidence that aluminum does not directly cause the formation of NFTs or AD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Edwardson JA, Candy JM, Ince PG, ''et al.'' |title=Aluminium accumulation, beta-amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary changes in the central nervous system |journal=Ciba Found. Symp. |volume=169 |issue= |pages=165–79 |year=1992 |pmid=1490421 |doi=10.1002/9780470514306.ch10 |url=}}</ref>

==Pathology==
It has been shown that the degree of cognitive impairment in diseases such as AD is significantly correlated with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Braskie M. N., Klunder A. D., Hayashi K. M., Protas H., Kepe V., Miller K. J. ''et al.'' | year = 2010 | title = Plaque and tangle imaging and cognition in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. [Article] | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 1669–1678 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2008.09.012 | pmid = 19004525 | pmc = 2891885 }}</ref>

===Harmful or Protective?===
There has been some suggestion that the formation of NFTs does not have a causal relationship with disease. Rather that NFTs may be produced in response to a variety of conditions and may in fact be a compensatory response against [[oxidative stress]] and serves a protective function. Several points are made to argue the position that NFTs are perhaps protective instead of harmful. First there appears to be a dispute as to the impact of neurofibrillary tangles on neuronal viability because some neurons containing NFTs survive for decades.<ref name="Lee"/> Furthermore, NFTs have been found in apparently healthy individuals, indicating that NFTs are not directly related to neural [[degeneration]]. It has been proposed that the formation of NFTs is part of a multifaced compensatory response where oxidative insult activates several [[kinases]], which are then capable of phosphorylating tau. This then prompts the early formation of NFTs, which reduce oxidative damage and prolong the function of the neuron.<ref name="Lee"/> While an intriguing theory, scientists have not come to a firm conclusion as to what role NFTs play in neurodegenerative diseases.

===Neuron loss===
Traditionally believed to play a major role in neuron loss, NFTs are an early event in pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease, and as more NFTs form, there is substantially more neuron loss. However, it has been shown that there is significant neuron loss before the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and that NFTs account for only a small proportion (around 8.1%) of this neuron loss.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kril J. J., Patel S., Harding A. J., Halliday G. M. | year = 2002 | title = Neuron loss from the [[hippocampus]] of Alzheimer's disease exceeds [[extracellular]] neurofibrillary tangle formation. [Article] | url = | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 103 | issue = 4| pages = 370–376 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-001-0477-5 | pmid = 11904757 }}</ref> Coupled with the longevity of neurons containing NFTs, it is likely that some other factor is primarily responsible for the bulk of neuron loss in these diseases, not the formation of neurofibrillary tangles.

===NFT-predominant dementia vs. Classical Alzheimer’s===
It is currently unclear as to whether or not Neurofibrillary tangle-predominant dementia (NFTPD) (a.k.a. tangle-only dementia) is a variant of the traditional Alzheimer’s disease, or a genetically distinct entity. Characterized by later onset and milder cognitive impairment, the distribution of NFT pathology is more closely related to that found in [[centenarians]] showing no or limited cognitive impairment. NFTs are generally limited to allo[[Cerebral cortex|cortical]]/[[limbic]] regions of the brain with limited progression to the [[neocortex]] but a greater density in the allocortical/hippocampal region. Plaques are generally absent.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00401-012-1017-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Santa-Maria|first=Ismael|coauthors=Haggiagi, Aya; Liu, Xinmin; Wasserscheid, Jessica; Nelson, Peter T.; Dewar, Ken; Clark, Lorraine N.; Crary, John F.|title=The MAPT H1 haplotype is associated with tangle-predominant dementia|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|year=2012|volume=124|issue=5|pages=693–704|doi=10.1007/s00401-012-1017-1}}</ref>

===Alzheimer disease with concomitant dementia with Lewy bodies (AD+DLB) ===
The degree of NFT involvement in AD is defined by [[Braak staging]]. Braak stages I and II are used when NFT involvent is confined mainly to the trans[[entorhinal]] region of the brain. Stages III and IV indicated involvement of limbic regions such as the hippocampus, and V and VI when there's extensive neocortical involvement. This should not be confused with the degree of [[senile plaque]] involvement, which progresses differently.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Braak |first1=H. |last2=Braak |first2=E. |title=Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=239–59 |year=1991 |pmid=1759558 |doi=10.1007/BF00308809}}</ref>

Neurofibrillary tangle and modified Braak scores were lower in AD+DLB, however, neocortical NFT scores show markedly different patterns between AD+DLB and Classical Alzheimers. In pure AD, NFT are predominately found at a high frequency: In AD+DLB, the distribution of NFT frequency was found to be bimodal: NFTs were either frequent or few to absent. Additionally, neocortical NFT frequency in the AD+DLB group tended to parallel the severity of other types of tau [[cytopathology]].<ref>{{cite journal|year=1999|month=Feb|title=Neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer disease with Lewy bodies - Two subgroups|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=56|issue=2|pages=203–208|pmid=10025425|author=Gearing, M., Lynn, M., & Mirra, S. S.|doi=10.1001/archneur.56.2.203}}</ref>

===Link to Aggression and Depression In Alzheimer's Patients===
A recent study looked for correlation between the quantitative aspects of Alzheimer's disease (neuron loss, neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle load) and aggression frequently found in Alzheimer's patients. It was found that only an increase in neurofibrillary tangle load was associated with severity of aggression and chronic aggression in Alzheimer's patients.<ref name="Lai"/> While this study does indicate a [[correlation]] between NFT load and severity of aggression, it does not provide a [[causative]] argument.

Research has also indicated that patients with AD and comorbid [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] show higher levels of neurofibrillary tangle formation than individuals with AD but no depression.<ref name="Rapp"/> Comorbid depression increased the odds for advanced neuropathologic disease stage even when controlling for age, gender, education and cognitive function.<ref name="Rapp"/>

==Treatment==
[[Image:RNAi-simplified.png|thumb|right|Upright|Overview of RNA interference.]]

===Statins===
[[Statins]] have been shown to reduce the neurofibrillary tangle burden in mouse models, likely due to their [[anti-inflammatory]] capacities.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Boimel M., Grigoriadis N., Lourbopoulos A., Touloumi O., Rosenmann D., Abramsky O. ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Statins Reduce the Neurofibrillary Tangle Burden in a Mouse Model of Tauopathy.

===Cyclin-dependent kinase 5===
[[Cyclin-dependent kinase 5]] (CDK5) is a kinase that has been previously hypothesized to contribute to tau pathologies.  [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) mediated silencing of the CDK5 gene has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy against tau pathology, such as neurofibrillary tangles. [[Gene knockdown|Knockdown]] of CDK5 has been shown to reduce the phosphorylation of tau in [[Primary culture|primary neuronal cultures]] and in mouse models. Furthermore, this silencing showed a dramatic reduction in the number of neurofibrillary tangles. However, in conditions such as [[Alzheimer's Disease]], only about 1% is hereditary, and therefore RNAi therapy may be inadequate for addressing the needs of the majority of those who suffer from this disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Piedrahita D., Hernandez I., Lopez-Tobon A., Fedorov D., Obara B., Manjunath B. S. ''et al.'' | year = 2010 | title = Silencing of CDK5 Reduces Neurofibrillary Tangles in Transgenic Alzheimer's Mice | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 42| pages = 13966–13976 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3637-10.2010 | pmid = 20962218 | pmc = 3003593 }}</ref>

===Lithium===
Lithium has been shown to decrease the phosphorylation of tau.<ref name="Leroy"/> Lithium treatment has been shown to reduce the density of neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic models in the hippocampus and [[spinal cord]]. Despite the decrease in density of NFTs, motor and memory  deficits were not seen to improve following treatment. Additionally, no preventative effects have been seen in patients undergoing lithium treatment.<ref name="Leroy"/>

===Curcumin===
Curcumin (as Longvida) has been shown to reduce memory deficit and tau monomers in animal models, however no clinical trials have shown curcumin to remove tau from the brain.<ref name="Ma"/>
