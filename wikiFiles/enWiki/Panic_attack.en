'''Panic attacks''' are periods of intense [[fear]] or [[apprehension]] that are of sudden onset<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/panic%20attack |title=Panic attack - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> and of variable duration from minutes to hours. Panic attacks usually begin abruptly, may reach a peak within 10 minutes, but may continue for much longer if the sufferer had the attack triggered by a situation from which they are not able to escape. In panic attacks that continue unabated, and are triggered by a situation from which the sufferer desires to escape, some sufferers may make frantic efforts to escape, which may be violent if others attempt to contain the sufferer. Some panic attacks can subside on their own over the next several hours. Often, those afflicted will experience significant ''anticipatory anxiety'' and [[limited symptom attack]]s in between attacks, in situations where attacks have previously occurred.
The effects of a panic attack vary. Some notably first-time sufferers, may call for emergency services. Many who experience a panic attack, mostly for the first time, fear they are having a [[heart attack]] or a [[nervous breakdown]].<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Don't Panic: Taking Control of Your Anxiety Attacks.

==Description==
Sufferers of panic attacks often report a fear or sense of dying, "going crazy," or experiencing a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or "flashing vision," feeling [[fainting|faint]] or [[vomiting|nauseated]], a numb sensation throughout the body, heavy breathing (and almost always, [[hyperventilation]]), or losing control of themselves. Some people also suffer from [[tunnel vision]], mostly due to blood flow leaving the head to more critical parts of the body in defense. These feelings may provoke a strong urge to escape or flee the place where the attack began (a consequence of the sympathetic "[[fight-or-flight response]]") in which the hormone which causes this response is released in significant amounts. This response floods the body with [[hormones]], particularly [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), that aid it in defending against harm.<ref name=Bourne2005>[[Edmund Bourne|Bourne, E.]] (2005). ''The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook'', 4th Edition: [[New Harbinger Press]].</ref>

A panic attack is a response of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS). <!-- Comment: Removed because it is covered in physiology section  During a panic attack, the body typically releases large amounts of [[adrenaline]] into the [[bloodstream]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}--> The most common symptoms may include [[trembling]], [[dyspnea]] ([[shortness of breath]]), [[heart palpitation]]s, [[chest pain]] (or chest tightness), [[hot flash]]es, cold flashes, burning sensations (particularly in the facial or neck area), [[sweating]], [[nausea]], [[dizziness]] (or slight [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]), [[light-headedness]], [[hyperventilation]], [[paresthesia]]s (tingling sensations), sensations of [[choking]] or [[smothering]], difficulty moving and [[derealization]].  These physical symptoms are interpreted with alarm in people prone to panic attacks.  This results in increased anxiety, and forms a [[positive feedback]] loop.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Panic Anxiety and Its Treatments: Report of the World Psychiatric Association Presidential Educational Program Task Force | publisher=American Psychiatric Association | first1=Gerald L. | last1=Klerman | first2=Robert M. A. | last2= Hirschfeld | first3=Myrna M. | last3=Weissman | page=44 | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-88048-684-2}}</ref><!-- Although, it must be said that the term 'positive' feedback loop is used in the sense of describing the loop itself, since multiple episodes of panic attacks are the farthest from positive many people can get.--> <!--Removed: Anxiety generated by these internal sensations activates the SNS, creating more sensations and more SNS arousal. This causes a [[positive feedback]] loop that increases their anxiety and can lead to a panic attack or worsen one that has already developed.-->

Often, the onset of [[shortness of breath]] and [[chest pain]] are the predominant symptoms; the sufferer incorrectly appraises this as a sign or [[symptom]] of a [[heart attack]]. This can result in the person experiencing a panic attack seeking treatment in an [[emergency room]]. However, since chest pain and shortness of breath are indeed hallmark symptoms of cardiovascular illnesses, including [[unstable angina]] and [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), especially in a person whose mental health status and heart health status are not known, attributing these pains to simple anxiety and not (also) a physical condition is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] (other conditions must be ruled out first) until an [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]] and a mental health assessment have been carried out. 

Panic attacks are distinguished from other forms of anxiety by their intensity and their sudden, episodic nature.<ref name=Bourne2005/> They are often experienced in conjunction with anxiety disorders and other [[psychological]] conditions, although panic attacks are not usually indicative of a [[mental disorder]]. <!-- Comment: Covered in Triggers section  Panic attacks can be caused by very common problems such as low blood sugar [[hypoglycemia]], [[hyperthyroidism]], or the overuse of [[caffeine]] or [[nicotine]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}-->

==Signs and symptoms==
===Diagnostic criteria===
[[DSM-IV]] Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Attack
A discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four (or more) of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes:
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-2}}
*Palpitations, and/or accelerated heart rate
*Sweating
*Trembling or shaking
*Sensations of shortness of breath or being smothered
*Feeling of choking
*Chest pain or discomfort
*Nausea or abdominal distress
{{Col-2}}
*Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint
*De-realization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)
*Fear of losing control or going insane
*Sense of impending death
*Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)
*Chills or hot flashes

{{Col-end}}

Note that while the DSM-IV-TR only lists the 13 specific symptoms above, it has been proposed that culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and uncontrollable screaming or crying) be added to the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for a panic attack.

Part or all of these symptoms can be found in the presence of a [[Pheochromocytoma]]

==Causes==
*Long-term, predisposing causes — [[heredity]]. Panic disorder has been found to run in families, and this may mean that inheritance plays a strong role <ref>DSM</ref> in determining who will get it. However, many people who have no family history of the disorder develop it. The onset of panic disorder usually occurs in early adulthood, although it may appear at any age. It occurs more frequently in women and often in people with above average intelligence. Various [[twin studies]] where one identical twin has an anxiety disorder have reported an incidence ranging from 31 to 88 percent of the other twin also having an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Environmental factors such as ''an overly cautious view of the world'' expressed by parents and cumulative stress over time have been found to be correlated with panic attacks.<ref name=Bourne2005/>
*Biological causes —  [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[post traumatic stress disorder]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[Wilson's disease]], [[mitral valve prolapse]], [[pheochromocytoma]], and inner ear disturbances ([[labyrinthitis]]).<ref name=Bourne2005/> Parasitic infection can cause psychiatric symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19404821 | doi=10.1080/10398560902840240 | volume=17 | issue=3 | title=Hallucinations arising in the context of torn attachment, traumatic childhood and tapeworms | year=2009 | month=June | author=Power B, Goossens C | journal=Australas Psychiatry | pages=240–2}}</ref>
*Phobias — People will often experience panic attacks as a direct result of exposure to a [[phobic]] object or situation.
*Short-term triggering causes — Significant personal loss, including an emotional attachment to a romantic partner, life transitions, significant life change and, as seen below, [[stimulants]] such as [[caffeine]] or [[nicotine]], can act as triggers.<ref name=Bourne2005/>
* Maintaining causes — Avoidance of panic provoking situations or environments, anxious/negative [[self-talk]] ("what-if" thinking), mistaken beliefs ("these symptoms are harmful and/or dangerous"), withheld [[feeling]]s, lack of assertiveness.<ref name=Bourne2005/>
* Lack of [[assertiveness]] — A growing body of [[evidence]] supports the idea that those that suffer from panic attacks engage in a [[Passivity (behavior)|passive]] style of communication or interactions with others. This communication style, while polite and respectful, is also characteristically un-assertive. This un-assertive way of communicating seems to contribute to panic attacks while being frequently present in those that are afflicted with panic attacks.<ref name=Bourne2005/>
* Medications — Sometimes, panic attacks may be a listed side effect of medications such as [[methylphenidate]]<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000606/ Side Effects]</ref> or even [[fluoroquinolone]]-type antibiotics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sternbach H, State R |title=Antibiotics: neuropsychiatric effects and psychotropic interactions |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=214–226 |year=1997 |pmid=9427014 |doi= 10.3109/10673229709000304|url=}}</ref> These may be a temporary side effect, only occurring when a patient first starts a medication, or could continue occurring even after the patient is accustomed to the drug, which likely would warrant a medication change in either dosage or type of drug. Nearly the entire [[SSRI]] class of antidepressants can cause increased anxiety in the beginning of use. It is not uncommon for inexperienced users to have panic attacks while weaning on or off the medication, especially ones prone to anxiety.
* Alcohol, medication or drug withdrawal — Various substances both prescribed and unprescribed can cause panic attacks to develop as part of their [[withdrawal syndrome]] or [[rebound effect]]. Alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal are the most well known to cause these effects as a rebound withdrawal symptom of their tranquillising properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen SI |title=Alcohol and benzodiazepines generate anxiety, panic and phobias |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=73–7 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7769598 |pmc=1295099 |doi= }}</ref>
*Hyperventilation syndrome — Breathing from the chest may cause overbreathing, exhaling excessive [[carbon dioxide]] in relation to the amount of [[oxygen]] in one's [[bloodstream]]. [[Hyperventilation syndrome]] can cause [[respiratory alkalosis]] and [[hypocapnia]]. This syndrome often involves prominent mouth breathing as well. This causes a cluster of symptoms including rapid [[Cardiac cycle|heart beat]], [[dizziness]], and [[lightheadedness]] which can trigger panic attacks.<ref name=Bourne2005/>
*Situationally bound panic attacks — Associating certain situations with panic attacks, due to experiencing one in that particular situation, can create a cognitive or behavioral predisposition to having panic attacks in certain situations (situationally bound panic attacks). It is a form of classical conditioning. Examples of this include college, work, or deployment.<ref name=Bourne2005/> See [[PTSD]]
*Pharmacological triggers — Certain chemical substances, mainly stimulants but also certain depressants, can either contribute pharmacologically to a constellation of provocations, and thus trigger a panic attack or even a panic disorder, or directly induce one.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000924.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Panic disorder<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://panicdisorder.about.com/cs/shfitness/a/caffeine.htm Caffeine and Panic Disorder<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This includes caffeine, amphetamine, alcohol and many more. Some sufferers of panic attacks also report phobias of specific drugs or chemicals, that thus have a merely [[psychosomatic]] effect, thereby functioning as drug triggers by nonpharmacological means.<ref>[http://fondationmarievictorin.qc.ca/panic-and-anxiety-attack-medication.php Psychosomatic And Drug-induced Panic Attacks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><!-- will add information on so-called panicogens here later, that are often used in clinical studies to induce panic in mice, rats, etc. Alexa -->
*Chronic and/or serious illness — Cardiac conditions that can cause [[Sudden cardiac death|sudden death]] such as [[long QT syndrome]]; [[catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]] or [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]] can also result in panic attacks. This is particularly difficult to manage as the [[anxiety]] relates to events that may occur such as cardiac arrest, or if an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] is ''in situ'', the possibility of having a shock delivered. It can be difficult for someone with a cardiac condition to distinguish between symptoms of cardiac dysfunction and symptoms of anxiety. In CPVT, anxiety itself can and does trigger [[arrythmia]]. Current management of panic attacks secondary to cardiac conditions appears to rely heavily on [[benzodiazepines]], [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] and/or [[cognitive behavioural therapy]]. However, people in this group often experience multiple and unavoidable hospitalisations; in people with these types of diagnoses, it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms of a panic attack versus cardiac symptoms without an [[electrocardiogram]].

==Pathophysiology==
While the various symptoms of a panic attack may cause the person to feel that their body is failing, it is in fact protecting itself from harm. The various symptoms of a panic attack can be understood as follows. First, there is frequently (but not always) the sudden onset of fear with little provoking stimulus. This leads to a release of [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine) which brings about the so-called [[fight-or-flight response]] wherein the person's body prepares for strenuous physical activity.  This leads to an increased heart rate ([[tachycardia]]), rapid breathing ([[hyperventilation]]) which may be perceived as shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), and sweating (which increases grip and aids heat loss). Because strenuous activity rarely ensues, the hyperventilation leads to a drop in [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the [[human lung|lung]]s and then in the [[blood]].  This leads to shifts in blood [[pH]] ([[respiratory alkalosis]] or [[hypocapnia]]), which in turn can lead to many other symptoms, such as [[paresthesia|tingling or numbness]], [[dizziness]], [[burning]] and [[lightheadedness]]. Moreover, the release of [[adrenaline]] during a panic attack causes [[vasoconstriction]] resulting in slightly less [[blood flow]] to the head which causes [[dizziness]] and [[lightheadedness]]. A panic attack can cause [[blood sugar]] to be drawn away from the [[Human brain|brain]] and towards the major muscles. It is also possible for the person experiencing such an attack to feel as though they are unable to catch their breath, and they begin to take deeper breaths, which also acts to decrease carbon dioxide levels in the blood.

==Classification==
===Agoraphobia===
{{Main|Agoraphobia}}
[[Agoraphobia]] is an [[anxiety disorder]] which primarily consists of the fear of experiencing a difficult or embarrassing situation from which the sufferer cannot escape. Panic attacks are commonly linked to agoraphobia and the fear of not being able to escape a bad situation. As a result, severe sufferers of agoraphobia may become confined to their homes, experiencing difficulty traveling from this "safe place".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/agoraphobia/DS00894 |title=Agoraphobia |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> The word "agoraphobia" is an English adoption of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words [[agora]] (αγορά) and [[phobia|phobos]] (φόβος). The term "agora" refers to the place where ancient Greeks used to gather and talk about issues of the city, so it basically applies to any or all public places; however the essence of agoraphobia is a fear of panic attacks especially if they occur in public as the victim may feel like he or she has no escape. In the case of agoraphobia caused by [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] or [[social anxiety]], sufferers may be very embarrassed by having a panic attack publicly in the first place.  This translation is the reason for the common misconception that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces, and is not clinically accurate.  Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check for when making a diagnosis of [[panic disorder]]. Other syndromes like [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] or [[post traumatic stress disorder]] and [[Social Anxiety Disorder]] can also cause agoraphobia; basically any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome.<ref>[http://psychcentral.com/disorders/sx29.htm Psych Central: Agoraphobia Symptoms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

People who have had a panic attack in certain situations may develop [[irrational]] fears, called phobias, of these situations and begin to avoid them. Eventually, the pattern of avoidance and level of anxiety about another attack may reach the point where individuals with [[panic disorder]] are unable to drive or even step out of the house. At this stage, the person is said to have panic disorder with [[agoraphobia]]. This can be one of the most harmful side-effects of panic disorder as it can prevent sufferers from seeking treatment in the first place.

===Panic disorder===
{{Main|Panic disorder}}
People who have repeated, persistent attacks or feel severe anxiety about having another attack are said to have panic disorder. Panic disorder is strikingly different from other types of [[anxiety disorder]]s in that [[panic]] attacks are often sudden and unprovoked.<ref>[http://familydoctor.org/137.xml Panic Disorder: Panic Attacks and Agoraphobia – familydoctor.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Treatment==
Panic disorder can be effectively treated with a variety of interventions including psychological therapies and medication<ref name=Bourne2005/> with the evidence that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] has the longest duration of effect, followed by specific [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].<ref>Anxiety: management of anxiety (panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder) in adults in primary, secondary and community care. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.  Clinical Guideline 22. Issue date: April 2007 [http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG022quickrefguideamended.pdf]  ISBN 1-84629-400-2</ref> However, subsequent research by Barbara Milrod and her colleagues<ref>{{cite journal |last=Milrod |first=B. |last2=''et al.'' |year=2007 |title=A randomized controlled clinical trial of psychoanalytic psychotherapy for panic disorder |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=265–272 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.2.265 |first2=A. C. |last3=Busch |first3=F. |last4=Rudden |first4=M. |last5=Schwalberg |first5=M. |last6=Clarkin |first6=J. |last7=Aronson |first7=A. |last8=Singer |first8=M. |last9=Turchin |first9=W. |pmid=17267789 }}</ref> has shown that psychoanalytic psychotherapy is equally effective in relieving panic attacks as behavioral approaches and has fewer relapses.  A psychoanalytic approach that identifies actual but dissociated causes of panic reactions may lead to rapid disappearance of symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Mark J. Blechner |last=Blechner |first=M. |year=2007 |title=Approaches to panic attacks |journal=Neuropsychoanalysis |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=93–102 |doi= |url=http://karnacbooks.metapress.com/content/t3740201rx64202p/ }}</ref> 

The term ''anxiolytic'' has become nearly synonymous with the benzodiazepines because these compounds have been for almost 40 years the drugs of choice for stress-related anxiety.  Low doses of complete-agonist  benzodiazepines alleviate anxiety, agitation, and fear by their actions on receptors located in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula.  Administration of benzodiazepines during a panic attack may result in complete relief from symptoms in as little as ten or fifteen minutes.  Benzodiazepines do not treat the source of the underlying fear but rather offer rapid-onset relief from the immediate symptoms.

===Breathing exercises===
In the great majority of cases [[Hyperventilation syndrome|hyperventilation]] is involved so that re-establishing an even, measured [[diaphragmatic breathing]] pattern is appropriate, effective and rapid way to stop the attack.  Regular breathing helps to rebalance the oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the blood.  

[[David D. Burns]] recommends breathing exercises for those suffering from anxiety. One such breathing exercise is a 5-2-5 count. Using the stomach (or diaphragm) - and not the chest - you inhale (feel your stomach come out, as opposed to your chest expanding) for 5 seconds. As you reach the maximal point at inhalation, hold your breath for 2 seconds. Then slowly exhale, over 5 seconds. Repeat this cycle twice, and then breathe 'normally' for 5 cycles (1 cycle = 1 inhale + 1 exhale). The point is to focus on the breathing, and relax the heart-rate.  Regular [[diaphragmatic breathing]] may also be achieved by extending the outbreath either by counting or even humming.

Although breathing into a paper bag was a common traditional recommendation for attempting short-term treatment of the symptoms of an acute panic attack,<ref>[http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/ate/mentalhealth/205625.html Breathing in and out of a paper bag]</ref> it has more recently been criticized as inferior to measured breathing, even potentially worsening the panic attack, and possibly posing reducing needed blood oxygen.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bergeron |first1=J. David |last2=Le Baudour |first2=Chris |title=First Responder |accessdate=11 August 2010 |edition=8 |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-614059-7 |page=262 |chapter=Chapter 9: Caring for Medical Emergencies |quote= Do not use a paper bag in an attempt to treat hyperventilation. These patients can often be cared for with low-flow oxygen and lots of reassurance}}</ref><ref name=paperbaghazard>[http://firstaid.about.com/od/shortnessofbreat1/f/07_paper_bags.htm Hyperventilation Syndrome – Can I treat hyperventilation syndrome by breathing into a paper bag?]</ref> While the paper bag technique increases needed [[carbon dioxide]]  and so reduces symptoms, it may at the same time excessively lower [[oxygen]] levels in the [[blood stream]].<ref>Breathing into a paper bag restricts the fresh air you are able to get. Without fresh air, less oxygen is inhaled. So, breathing into a paper bag, it is argued, may dangerously lower the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream.  Accurate diagnosis is essential, since in rare but documented cases heart attack patients incorrectly thinking they had hyperventilation syndrome may have worsened their heart attacks by failing to take appropriate measures while breathing into a paper bag. http://firstaid.about.com/od/shortnessofbreat1/f/07_paper_bags.htm</ref>  To make matters worse, several studies now show a link between panic attacks and the abrupt increase in CO<sub>2</sub> from the paper bag method, so that use of the paper bag method itself may worsen feelings of panic in patients who might otherwise use measured breathing techniques with success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://firstaid.about.com/od/shortnessofbreat1/f/07_paper_bags.htm |title=Hyperventilation Syndrome - Treating hyperventilation syndrome by breathing into a paper bag |publisher=Firstaid.about.com |date=2007-10-03 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>  

For prevention, 30 minutes a day of physical exercise is recommended, as well as healthy nutrition and sleeping habits.

A back rub during a panic attack can help if the person has problems breathing well.

===Psychotherapies===
According to the American Psychological Association, "most specialists agree that a [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|combination of cognitive and behavioral therapies]] are the best treatment for panic disorder. Medication might also be appropriate in some cases".<ref>http://www.apa.org/topics/anxietyqanda.html</ref>  The first part of therapy is largely informational; many people are greatly helped by simply understanding exactly what panic disorder is, and how many others suffer from it. Many people who suffer from panic disorder are worried that their panic attacks mean they are 'going crazy' or that the panic might induce a heart attack. [[Cognitive restructuring]] helps people replace those thoughts with more realistic, positive ways of viewing the attacks.<ref name="Cognitive Restructuring Ability">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/rationalnumberproject/89_2.html|title=Cognitive Restructuring Ability, Teacher Guidance and Perceptual Distracter Tasks: An Aptitude Treatment Interaction Study|last=Cramer, K., Post, T., & Behr, M.|first=|date=January 1989|accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref>

In deeper level psychoanalytic approaches, in particular [[object relations theory]], panic attacks are frequently associated with [[splitting (psychology)]], [[paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions]], and [[paranoid anxiety]]. They are often found comorbid with [[borderline personality disorder]] and [[child sexual abuse]]. Paranoid anxiety may reach the level of a persecutory anxiety state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waska|first=Robert|title=Treating Severe Depressive and Persecutory Anxiety States: To Transform the Unbearable|year=2010|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=978-1855757202}}</ref> 

Meditation may also be helpful in the treatment of [[panic disorders]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kabat-Zinn|title=CALM THE PANIC|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=111&sid=d493b030-3427-4ade-bf0d-0c4a29ee3659%40sessionmgr15&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hxh&AN=9303300667|publisher=HEALTH FRONT}}</ref>

===Dietary changes===

Caffeine may cause or exacerbate panic anxiety. Anxiety can temporarily increase during withdrawal from caffeine and other various drugs.<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2000).

==Prognosis==
=== Limited symptom attack ===
Many people being treated for panic attacks begin to experience [[limited symptom attack]]s. These panic attacks are less comprehensive, with fewer than 4 bodily symptoms being experienced.<ref name=Bourne2005/>

It is not unusual to experience only one or two symptoms at a time, such as vibrations in their legs, or shortness of breath, or an intense wave of heat traveling up their bodies which is not similar to hot flashes due to estrogen shortage. Some symptoms, such as vibrations in the legs are sufficiently different from any normal sensation that they clearly indicate panic disorder.  Other symptoms on the list can occur in people who may or may not have panic disorder.  Panic disorder truly does not require four or more symptoms to all be present at the same time.   Pure causeless panic and the racing heart beat that panic causes are quite sufficient to indicate panic attack.<ref name=Bourne2005/>
