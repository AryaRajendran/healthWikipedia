'''Middlesex University,''' known primarily for its [[Medical school|medical]] and [[veterinary school]]s, operated from 1914 until 1947, first in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], later in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

The "Middlesex College of Medicine and Surgery" was founded in 1914 by John Hall Smith and originally located in East Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was affiliated with the Middlesex Hospital. In 1917, Massachusetts chartered an institution named the "University of Massachusetts" with the same board of trustees.<ref>(The present-day [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] is a completely unrelated institution; it was known at that time as "Massachusetts Agricultural College", later "Massachusetts State College", and did not become the "University of Massachusetts until 1947").{{Cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/umhome/about/history.html|title=UMass Amherst: A Brief History|accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref><ref name=lts>{{Cite web|url=http://lts.brandeis.edu/research/archives-speccoll/findingguides/archives/dept-subject/middlesex.html|title=Middlesex University|publisher=Robert D.

In 1928, it moved to the Waltham campus, the present-day campus of [[Brandeis University]]. The building which Brandeis calls "Usen Castle" or "the Castle" was originally the main building of Middlesex University and was designed and constructed by John Hall Smith between 1928 and 1940.<ref> Bernstein, Gerald S.

In 1935 Middlesex College of Medicine and Surgery received authorization to grant B.A. and B.S. degrees and became "Middlesex College." In 1937 it merged with the University of Massachusetts to become "Middlesex University," with schools of medicine, liberal arts, pharmacy, podiatry, and veterinary medicine, and the state of Massachusetts reclaimed the name "University of Massachusetts" for the [[University of Massachusetts | state college]].  

Middlesex University was important as a veterinary school; it was the only veterinary school in New England,<ref name=reisfounding>Reis, Arthur H., Jr. {{Cite web| title=The Founding | work=Brandeis Review, 50th Anniversary Edition | url=http://www.brandeis.edu/publications/review/50threview/founding.pdf | accessdate=2006-05-17}}, pp. 42-3: Only veterinary school in New England; C. Ruggles Smith quote about AMA opposition</ref> and when it closed in 1947, there was none in New England until [[Tufts University]] opened [[Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine|Cummings]] in 1978.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/vet/about/ Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine page] - Tufts University</ref> As of 2012, two Middlesex graduates were still practicing in Massachusetts, and four more were still living.<ref>Massachusetts Veterinary Medical Association [https://m360.massvet.org/frontend/search.aspx?cs=1698]</ref>

Middlesex University is described by a [[Brandeis University]] web page as "a university founded on the principles of equality, freedom, and scholarship, as the school maintained a student population diverse in race, color, and religion, during a time when many universities in the United States had quotas and were not as open."<ref name="lts"/> In particular, it freely admitted Jews during a time when most elite universities had [[Jewish quota]]s, and it had many Jews among its students and faculty. Its medical school experienced difficulty securing [[American Medical Association|AMA]] accreditation. The AMA said this was due to insufficient funds, faculty, and facilities, but some at the university believed that [[antisemitism]] played a role. In the words of C. Ruggles Smith, son of the founder:
:From its inception,  Middlesex was ruthlessly attacked by the American Medical Association, which at that time was dedicated to restricting the production of physicians, and to maintaining an inflexible policy of discrimination in the admission of medical students. Middlesex, alone among medical schools, selected its students on the basis of merit, and refused to establish any racial quotas.<ref name="reisfounding"/>

In 1944, a law making doctor's licensing dependent on holding an MD from an AMA-accredited medical school, and financial problems caused by World War II, made the situation of Middlesex University untenable. In 1946, the Middlesex trustees transferred the charter and campus of the university to the foundation which was to establish Brandeis, with the hope, not to be realized, that Brandeis would be able to continue the medical and veterinary schools. In 1947, Brandeis, feeling that the medical school would never be more than third-rate and that the financial burden of operating it was too heavy, closed its doors. [According to the account of Rabbi Israel Goldtstein on page 25 on his 1951 book ''Brandeis University: Chapter of its Founding'' the first three medical school classes had been suspended prior to Brandeis' acquisition of the charter and campus. However by this same account Brandeis University did choose to close the school of veterinary medicine.]
