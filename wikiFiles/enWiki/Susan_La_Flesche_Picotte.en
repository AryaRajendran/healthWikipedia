Dr. '''Susan La Flesche Picotte''' (June 17, 1865 - September 18, 1915) was the first [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] woman to become a [[physician]] in the [[United States]]. Of [[Ponca]], [[Iowa]], French and Anglo-American descent, she grew up with her parents on the [[Omaha Reservation]].  She went to college at the [[Hampton Institute]] and, in 1889, got her medical degree at the [[Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania]] (WMCP) in [[Philadelphia]]. 

LaFlesche Picotte worked in Nebraska, providing health care to her [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] people for much of her career. In private practice after 1894, she also had European-American patients. In 1913 she founded [[Dr. Susan LaFlesche Picotte Memorial Hospital|a hospital]] on the [[Omaha Reservation]] at [[Walthill, Nebraska]], the first on any reservation to be privately funded. After LaFlesche Picotte died two years later, the hospital as renamed in her honor. Later it was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Today it serves as a museum featuring her work and the history of the Omaha and [[Ho-Chunk]] tribes, and also has a center for the care of children.
