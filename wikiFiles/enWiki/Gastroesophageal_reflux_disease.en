'''Gastroesophageal reflux disease''' ('''GERD'''), '''gastro-oesophageal reflux disease''' ('''GORD'''), '''gastric reflux disease''', or '''acid reflux disease''' is a chronic symptom of [[mucosa]]l damage caused by stomach acid coming up from the [[stomach]] into the [[esophagus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=DeVault KR, Castell DO |title=Updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The Practice Parameters Committee of the American College of Gastroenterology |journal=[[The American Journal of Gastroenterology|Am J Gastroenterol]] |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=1434–42 |year=1999 |pmid=10364004 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.1123_a.x}}</ref>

GERD is usually caused by changes in the barrier between the [[stomach]] and the esophagus, including abnormal relaxation of the [[lower esophageal sphincter]], which normally holds the top of the stomach closed, impaired expulsion of gastric reflux from the esophagus, or a [[hiatal hernia]]. These changes may be permanent or temporary.

Treatment is typically via lifestyle changes and medications such as [[proton pump inhibitors]], [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> receptor blockers]] or [[antacids]] with or without [[alginic acid]].<ref name=Her2011/> Surgery may be an option in those who do not improve. In the Western world between 10 and 20% of the population is affected.

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Adults ===
The most-common symptoms of GERD are: 
* [[Heartburn]]<ref name="Overview">{{cite journal|last1=Zajac|first1=P|last2=Holbrook|first2=A|last3=Super|first3=ME|last4=Vogt|first4=M |title=An overview: Current clinical guidelines for the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of dyspepsia|journal=Osteopathic Family Physician |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=79-85 |year=2013 |month=March-April |pmid=|doi=10.1016/j.osfp.2012.10.005}}</ref>  
* [[Regurgitation (digestion)|Regurgitation]]
* Trouble swallowing ([[dysphagia]])

Less-common symptoms include:
* Pain with swallowing/[[sore throat]] ([[odynophagia]])
* [[Hypersalivation|Increased salivation]] (also known as water brash)
* [[Nausea]]<ref name="Kahrilas">{{cite journal |author=Kahrilas, PJ|title=Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease |journal=New England Journal of Medicine. |volume=359 |issue=16 |pages=1700–7 |year=2008 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp0804684 |pmid=18923172 |pmc=3058591}}</ref>
* [[Chest pain]]

GERD sometimes causes injury of the esophagus. These injuries may include:
* [[Reflux esophagitis]] – [[necrosis]] of esophageal epithelium causing ulcers near the junction of the stomach and esophagus
* [[Esophageal stricture]]s – the persistent narrowing of the esophagus caused by reflux-induced inflammation
* [[Barrett's esophagus]] – intestinal [[metaplasia]] (changes of the epithelial cells from squamous to intestinal columnar epithelium) of the distal esophagus<ref name="Sampliner">{{cite journal | author = Wang KK, Sampliner RE | title = Updated guidelines 2008 for the diagnosis, surveillance and therapy of Barrett's esophagus | journal = [[The American Journal of Gastroenterology|Am J Gastroenterol]] | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 788–97 | year = 2008 | month = March | pmid = 18341497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2008.01835.x | url = http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/BarrettsEsophagus08.pdf }}</ref>
* [[Esophageal adenocarcinoma]] – a rare form of cancer<ref name=Kahrilas/>

Some people have proposed that symptoms such as [[sinusitis]], recurrent ear infections, and [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] are due to GERD; however, a causative role has not been established.<ref name=Kahrilas/>{{Failed verification|date=April 2013}}

=== Children ===
GERD may be difficult to detect in [[infant]]s and [[child]]ren, since they cannot describe what they are feeling and indicators must be observed. Symptoms may vary from typical adult symptoms.  GERD in children may cause repeated [[vomiting]], effortless spitting up, [[coughing]], and other respiratory problems, such as wheezing. Inconsolable crying, refusing food, crying for food and then pulling off the bottle or breast only to cry for it again, failure to gain adequate weight, bad breath, and [[belching]] or [[burping]] are also common. Children may have one symptom or many; no single symptom is universal in all children with GERD.

Of the estimated 4&nbsp;million babies born in the US each year, up to 35% of them may have difficulties with reflux in the first few months of their lives, known as 'spitting up'.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=familydoctor.org |url=http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/children/parents/infants/218.html |title=Spitting Up in Babies}}</ref> One theory for this is the "fourth trimester theory" which notes most animals are born with significant mobility, but humans are relatively helpless at birth, and suggests there may have once been a fourth trimester, but children began to be born earlier, evolutionarily, to accommodate the  development of larger heads and brains and allow them to pass through the birth canal <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_colic#Fourth_trimester_theory</ref> and this leaves them with partially undeveloped digestive systems.

Most children will outgrow their reflux by their first birthday. However, a small but significant number of them will not outgrow the condition. This is particularly true when a family history of GERD is present.

=== Barrett's esophagus ===
{{Main|Barrett's esophagus}}

GERD may lead to [[Barrett's esophagus]], a type of intestinal [[metaplasia]],<ref name=Sampliner/> which is in turn a precursor condition for [[carcinoma]]. The risk of progression from Barrett's to dysplasia is uncertain, but is estimated at about 20% of cases.<ref>[http://www.gerd-library.com/dysplasia-and-barretts-esophagus/Dysplasia and Barrett's Esophagus]. Retrieved on 2009-02-01.</ref> Due to the risk of chronic heartburn progressing to Barrett's, [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|EGD]] every five years is recommended for patients with chronic heartburn, or who take drugs for chronic GERD.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}<!--http://www.springerlink.com/content/c11083102x785114/ says there are varying guidelines, and (the free preview, at least) doesn't support this at all.-->

== Causes ==
GERD is caused by a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter. In healthy patients, the "[[Angle of His]]"&mdash;the angle at which the esophagus enters the stomach&mdash;creates a valve that prevents duodenal bile, enzymes, and stomach acid from traveling back into the esophagus where they can cause burning and inflammation of sensitive esophageal tissue.

Factors that can contribute to GERD:
* [[Hiatal hernia]], which increases the likelihood of GERD due to mechanical and motility factors.<ref name="PMC2579007">{{cite journal |author=Sontag S|title=Defining GERD |journal=Yale J Biol Med |volume=72 |issue=2–3|pages=69–80|year=1999|pmc=2579007 |pmid=10780568}}</ref><ref name="pmid17573791">{{cite journal |author=Piesman M, Hwang I, Maydonovitch C, Wong RK |title=Nocturnal reflux episodes following the administration of a standardized meal.

* [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]], which can be present with increased gastric acidity due to [[gastrin]] production.
* [[Hypercalcemia]], which can increase [[gastrin]] production, leading to increased acidity.
* [[Scleroderma]] and [[systemic sclerosis]], which can feature esophageal dysmotility.
* The use of medicines such as [[prednisolone]].
* [[Visceroptosis]] or Glénard syndrome, in which the stomach has sunk in the abdomen upsetting the motility and acid secretion of the stomach.
* [[Yeast infection]]

GERD has been linked to a variety of respiratory and laryngeal complaints such as [[laryngitis]], chronic [[cough]], [[pulmonary fibrosis]], [[earache]], and [[asthma]], even when not clinically apparent. These atypical manifestations of GERD is commonly referred to as [[laryngopharyngeal reflux]] or as extraesophageal reflux disease (EERD).

Factors that have been linked with GERD, but not conclusively:
* [[sleep apnea|Obstructive sleep apnea]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morse CA, Quan SF, Mays MZ, Green C, Stephen G, Fass R |title=Is there a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux disease? |journal=Clin.

* [[Gallstones]], which can impede the flow of [[bile]] into the [[Duodenum]], which can affect the ability to neutralize [[gastric acid]]

In 1999, a review of existing studies found that, on average, 40% of GERD patients also had ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Helicobacter pylori and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease-clinical implications and management |author=H.J. O'Connor|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther |year=1999 |month=Feb |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=117–27|pmid=10102940 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.1999.00460.x}}</ref> The eradication of ''H. pylori'' can lead to an increase in acid secretion,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(97)70075-1 |author=El-Omar E |title= Helicobacter pylori infection and chronic gastric acid hyposecretion |journal= Gastroenterology |year= 1997 |volume=113 |pages=15–24|pmid=9207257 |issue=1 |author-separator=, |author2=Oien K |author3=Nujuni AE |display-authors=3 |last4=Gillen |first4=D|last5=Wirz |first5=A |last6=Dahill |first6=S |last7=Williams |first7=C |last8=Ardill |first8=JE |last9=McColl|first9=KE}}</ref> leading to the question of whether ''H. pylori''-infected GERD patients are any different than non-infected GERD patients. A [[double-blind]] study, reported in 2004, found no clinically significant difference between these two types of patients with regard to the subjective or objective measures of disease severity.<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.A.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Peptic stricture.png|thumb|[[Gastroscopy|Endoscopic]] image of peptic stricture, or narrowing of the [[esophagus]] near the junction with the [[stomach]]: This is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and can be a cause of dysphagia or difficulty swallowing.]]
The diagnosis of GERD is usually made when typical symptoms are present.<ref name=Katz2012/> Reflux can be present in people without symptoms and the diagnosis requires both symptoms or complications and reflux of stomach content.<ref name=AGA2008/>

Other investigations may include [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] (EGD). [[Barium swallow]] [[X-ray]]s should not be used for diagnosis.<ref name=Katz2012>{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=PO|coauthors=Gerson, LB; Vela, MF|title=Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=2012 Mar|volume=108|issue=3|pages=308-28|pmid=23419381}}</ref> [[esophageal motility study|Esophageal manometry]] is not recommended for use in diagnosis being recommended only prior to surgery.<ref name=Katz2012/> Ambulatory [[esophageal pH monitoring]] may be useful in those who do not improve after PPIs and is not needed in those in whom Barrett's esophagus is seen.<ref name=Katz2012/> Investigations for H. pylori is not usually needed.<ref name=Katz2012/>

The current gold standard for diagnosis of GERD is esophageal pH monitoring. It is the most objective test to diagnose the reflux disease and allows monitoring GERD patients in their response to medical or surgical treatment. One practice for diagnosis of GERD is a short-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors, with improvement in symptoms suggesting a positive diagnosis. Short-term treatment with [[proton-pump inhibitors]] may help predict abnormal 24-hr pH monitoring results among patients with symptoms suggestive of [[GERD]].<ref name="pmid15068979">{{cite journal| title=Short-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors as a test for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a meta-analysis of diagnostic test characteristics |year=2004 | month = April |journal=Annals of internal medicine |pmid=15068979 | last1=Numans| first1=ME| last2=Lau| first2=J| last3=de Wit| first3=NJ| last4=Bonis| first4=PA| volume=140| issue=7| pages=518–27 | url = http://www.annals.org/content/140/7/518.full.pdf }}</ref>

===Endoscopy===
[[Endoscopy]], the looking down at the stomach with a fiber-optic scope, is not routinely needed if the case is typical and responds to treatment.<ref name=Katz2012/> It is recommended when people either do not respond well to treatment or have alarm symptoms, including dysphagia, anemia, blood in the stool (detected chemically), [[asthma|wheezing]], weight loss, or voice changes.<ref name=Katz2012/> Some physicians advocate either once-in-a-lifetime or 5- to 10-yearly endoscopy for patients with longstanding GERD, to evaluate the possible presence of dysplasia or Barrett's esophagus.<ref>[http://www.gerd-library.com/diagnosis-endoscopy/ Diagnosis - Endoscopy]. Retrieved on 2009-03-20.{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

[[Biopsy|Biopsies]] performed during gastroscopy may show:
* Edema and basal hyperplasia (nonspecific inflammatory changes)
* Lymphocytic inflammation (nonspecific)
* Neutrophilic inflammation (usually due to reflux or ''[[Helicobacter]]'' [[gastritis]])
* Eosinophilic inflammation (usually due to reflux): The presence of intraepithelial [[eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]] may suggest a diagnosis of [[eosinophilic esophagitis]] (EE) if eosinophils are present in high enough numbers. Less than 20 eosinophils per high-power microscopic field in the [[distal]] esophagus, in the presence of other histologic features of GERD, is more consistent with GERD than EE.<ref name=Sternberg>Mills, S (ed.) 2009.Sternberg's Diagnostic Pathology. 5th Edition. ISBN 978-0-7817-7942-5</ref>
* Goblet cell intestinal metaplasia or Barrett's esophagus
* Elongation of the papillae
* Thinning of the squamous cell layer
* [[Dysplasia]] 
* [[Carcinoma]]

Reflux changes may not be erosive in nature, leading to "nonerosive reflux disease".

===Differential diagnosis===
Other causes of [[chest pain]] such as [[heart disease]] should be ruled out before making the diagnosis.<ref name=Katz2012/> Another kind of acid reflux, which causes [[respiratory]] and [[Larynx|laryngeal]] signs and symptoms, is called [[laryngopharyngeal reflux]] (LPR) or "[[extraesophageal reflux disease]]" (EERD). Unlike GERD, LPR rarely produces heartburn, and is sometimes called ''silent reflux''.

== Treatment ==
The treatments for GERD include lifestyle modifications, medications, and possibly surgery. Initial treatment is frequently with a [[proton-pump inhibitor]] such as [[omeprazole]].<ref name=Katz2012/>

=== Lifestyle ===
Certain foods and lifestyle are considered to promote gastroesophageal reflux, however most dietary interventions have little supporting evidence.<ref name=Fes2009>{{cite journal|last=Festi|first=D|coauthors=Scaioli, E; Baldi, F; Vestito, A; Pasqui, F; Di Biase, AR; Colecchia, A|title=Body weight, lifestyle, dietary habits and gastroesophageal reflux disease|journal=World journal of gastroenterology : WJG|date=2009 Apr 14|volume=15|issue=14|pages=1690–701|pmid=19360912|doi=10.3748/wjg.15.1690|pmc=2668774}}</ref> [[Weight loss]] and elevating the head of the bed are generally useful.<ref name=Kal2006>{{cite journal |author=Kaltenbach T, Crockett S, Gerson LB |title=Are lifestyle measures effective in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease?

=== Medications ===
{{main|Drugs for acid-related disorders}}
The primary medications used for GERD are proton-pump inhibitors, [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> receptor blockers]] and [[antacids]] with or without [[alginic acid]].<ref name=Her2011/>

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) (such as [[omeprazole]]) are the most effective followed by H<sub>2</sub> receptor blockers (such as [[ranitidine]]).<ref name=AGA2008/> If a once daily PPI is only partially effective they may be used twice a day.<ref name=AGA2008/> They should be taken a half to one hour before a meal.<ref name=Katz2012/> There is no significant difference between agents in this class.<ref name=Katz2012/> When these medications are used long term, the lowest effective dose should be taken.<ref name=AGA2008>{{cite journal|last=Kahrilas|first=PJ|coauthors=Shaheen, NJ; Vaezi, MF; Hiltz, SW; Black, E; Modlin, IM; Johnson, SP; Allen, J; Brill, JV; American Gastroenterological, Association|title=American Gastroenterological Association Medical Position Statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease|journal=Gastroenterology|date=2008 Oct|volume=135|issue=4|pages=1383–1391, 1391.e1–5|pmid=18789939|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2008.08.045}}</ref> They may also be taken only when symptoms occur in those with frequent problems.<ref name=Katz2012/> H<sub>2</sub> receptor blockers lead to roughly a 40% improvement.<ref name=Tran2007>{{cite journal |author=Tran T, Lowry A, El-Serag H|title=Meta-analysis: the efficacy of over-the-counter gastro-oesophageal reflux disease drugs |journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=143–53 |year=2007 |pmid=17229239 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03135.x}}</ref>

The evidence for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% ([[number needed to treat|NNT]]=13) while a combination of an antacid and alginic acid (such as [[Gaviscon]]) may improve symptoms 60% (NNT=4).<ref name=Tran2007/> [[Metoclopramide]] (a prokinetic) is not recommended either alone or in combination with other treatments due to concerns around adverse effects.<ref name=Her2011/><ref name=AGA2008/> The benefit of the prokinetic [[mosapride]] is modest.<ref name=Her2011/>

[[Sucralfate]] has a similar effectiveness to H<sub>2</sub> receptor blockers; however, sucralfate needs to be taken multiple times a day thus limiting it use.<ref name=Her2011>{{cite journal|last=Hershcovici|first=T|coauthors=Fass, R|title=Pharmacological management of GERD: where does it stand now?|journal=Trends in pharmacological sciences|date=2011 Apr|volume=32|issue=4|pages=258–64|pmid=21429600|doi=10.1016/j.tips.2011.02.007}}</ref> [[Baclofen]], an agonist of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, while effective, has similar issues of needing frequent dosing in addition to greater adverse effects compared to other medications.<ref name=Her2011/>

=== Surgery ===
The standard surgical treatment for severe GERD is the [[Nissen fundoplication]]. In this procedure, the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and to repair a hiatal hernia.<ref name=Abbas_2004>{{cite journal |author=Abbas A |title=The role of laparoscopic fundoplication in Barrett's esophagus |journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=393–6 |year=2004 |pmid=14759403 |doi=10.1016/S0003-4975(03)01352-3 |author-separator=, |author2=Deschamps C |author3=Cassivi SD |display-authors=3 |last4=Allen |first4=Mark S |last5=Nichols |first5=Francis C |last6=Miller |first6=Daniel L |last7=Pairolero |first7=Peter C}}</ref> It is only recommended in those who improve with PPIs.<ref name=Katz2012/> Benefits are equal to medical treatment in those with chronic symptoms.<ref name=Katz2012/> In addition, in the short and medium term, laparoscopic fundoplication improves [[quality of life]] compared to medical management.<ref name="pmid20238321">{{cite journal| author=|title=Medical versus surgical management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in adults|year=2010|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |pmid=20238321|pmc=|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003243.pub2| last1=Wileman| first1=SM| last2=McCann| first2=S| last3=Grant| first3=AM| last4=Krukowski| first4=ZH| last5=Bruce| first5=J| volume=3| issue=3| pages=CD003243| last6=Wileman| first6=Samantha M| editor1-last=Wileman| editor1-first=Samantha M}}</ref> When comparing different fundoplication techniques, partial posterior fundoplication surgery is more effective than partial anterior fundoplication surgery.<ref name=Kurian2013>{{cite journal |author=Kurian AA, Bhayani N, Sharata A, Reavis K, Dunst CM, Swanström LL |title=Partial anterior vs partial posterior fundoplication following transabdominal esophagocardiomyotomy for achalasia of the esophagus: meta-regression of objective postoperative gastroesophageal reflux and dysphagia |journal=JAMA Surg |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=85–90 |year=2013 |month=January |pmid=23324843 |doi=10.1001/jamasurgery.2013.409}}</ref>

=== Pregnancy ===
In pregnancy, dietary modifications and lifestyle changes may be attempted, but often have little effect. Calcium-based [[antacids]] are recommended if these changes are not effective.

*</ref> The overuse of this treatment is a problem because of the side effects and costs which the patient will have from undergoing unnecessary therapy, and patients should not take more treatment than they need.<ref name="PPIoveruse"/>

In some cases, a person with GERD symptoms can manage them by taking [[over-the-counter drugs]] and making lifestyle changes.<ref name="OTCtreatment">

==Epidemiology==
In Western populations GERD affects approximately 10% to 20% of the population and 0.4% newly develop the condition.<ref name=Her2011/>  For instance, an estimated 3.4 million to 6.8 million Canadians are GERD sufferers. The prevalence rate of GERD in developed nations is also tightly linked with age, with adults aged 60 to 70 being the most commonly affected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fedorak RN, Veldhuyzen van Zanten S, Bridges R |title=Canadian Digestive Health Foundation Public Impact Series: Gastroesophageal reflux disease in Canada: Incidence, prevalence, and direct and indirect economic impact|journal=Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=431–4 |year=2010 |month = July |pmid=20652158|laysummary =http://www.pulsus.com:80/journals/abstract.jsp?HCtype=Consumer&sCurrPg=journal&jnlKy=2&atlKy=9604&isuKy=928&spage=1&isArt=t& |pmc=2918483 }}</ref> In the United States 20% of people have symptoms in a given week and 7% everyday.<ref name=Her2011/> No data support sex predominance with regard to GERD.

==History==

An obsolete treatment is [[vagotomy]] ("highly selective vagotomy"), the surgical removal of [[vagus nerve]] branches that innervate the stomach lining. This treatment has been largely replaced by medication.

==Research==
A number of endoscopic devices have been tested to treat chronic heartburn. One system, Endocinch, puts stitches in the lower esophogeal sphincter to create small pleats to help strengthen the muscle. However, long-term results were disappointing, and the device is no longer sold by Bard.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jafri|first=SM|coauthors=Arora, G; Triadafilopoulos, G|title=What is left of the endoscopic antireflux devices?|journal=Current opinion in gastroenterology|date=2009 Jul|volume=25|issue=4|pages=352–7|pmid=19342950|doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e32832ad8b4}}</ref> Another, the [[Stretta procedure]], uses electrodes to apply radio-frequency energy to the LES. The long-term outcomes of both procedures compared to a Nissen fundoplication are still being determined.

The NDO Surgical Plicator creates a plication, or fold, of tissue near the gastroesophageal junction, and fixates the plication with a suture-based implant. The company ceased operations in mid-2008, and the device is no longer on the market.

Another treatment, transoral incisionless fundoplication, which uses a device called Esophyx, may be effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Testoni|first=PA|coauthors=Vailati, C|title=Transoral incisionless fundoplication with EsophyX® for treatment of gastro-oesphageal reflux disease|journal=Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver|date=2012 Aug|volume=44|issue=8|pages=631–5|pmid=22622203|doi=10.1016/j.dld.2012.03.019}}</ref>
