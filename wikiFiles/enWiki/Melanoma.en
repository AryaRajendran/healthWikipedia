The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor. If melanoma is found early, while it is still small and thin, and if it is completely removed, then the chance of cure is high. The likelihood of the melanoma coming back or spreading depends on how deeply it has gone into the layers of the skin. For melanomas that come back or spread, treatments include [[chemotherapy|chemo-]] and [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]], or [[radiation therapy]].
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Signs and symptoms==
Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing [[Mole (skin marking)|moles]] or, in the case of [[nodular melanoma]], the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin (such [[lesion]]s should be referred without delay to a dermatologist). At later stages, the mole may [[itch]], [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerate]] or bleed.<ref>[http://www.melanomawarningsigns.com MelanomaWarningSigns.com]</ref>  Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic "ABCDE":
*'''A'''symmetry
* '''B'''orders (irregular)
*'''C'''olor (variegated)
*'''D'''iameter (greater than {{convert|6|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, about the size of a pencil eraser)
*'''E'''volving over time
These classifications do not, however, apply to the most dangerous form of melanoma, nodular melanoma, which has its own classifications:

*'''E'''levated above the skin surface
*'''F'''irm to the touch
*'''G'''rowing
Metastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific [[paraneoplastic syndrome|paraneoplastic symptoms]], including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. [[Metastasis]] of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare: less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. [[brain metastasis|Brain metastases]] are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fiddler IJ |title=Melanoma metastasis |journal=Cancer Control |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=398–404 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=10862180 |url=http://www.moffitt.usf.edu/pubs/ccj/v2n5/article3.html}}</ref>  It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen or distant lymph nodes.

==Cause==
<!-- References: all material here has been sourced from allied/related articles in Wikipedia. However, since Wikipedia is only a third-class reference, the sources should probably not be cited. -->
All cancers are caused by damage to the [[DNA]] inside cells. This damage can be inherited in the form of [[genetic mutations]], but in most cases, it builds up over a person's lifetime and is caused by factors in their environment. DNA damage causes the cell to grow out of control, leading to a [[tumor]]. Melanoma is usually caused by damage from UV light from the sun, but UV light from [[Tanning bed|sunbeds]] can also contribute to the disease.<ref>{{cite book |title=Solar and ultraviolet radiation |year=1992 |volume=55 |series=IARC Monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol55/}}</ref> 

===Genetics===
{{See also|List of genes mutated in pigmented cutaneous lesions}}
A number of rare mutations, which often run in families, are known to greatly increase one’s susceptibility to melanoma. Several different [[genes]] have been identified as increasing the risk of developing melanoma. Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called [[melanocortin 1 receptor|MC1R]] that causes red hair, have a relatively lower elevated risk.  [[Genetic testing]] can be used to determine whether a person has one of the currently known mutations. 

One class of mutations affects the gene [[P16 (gene)|CDKN2A]]. An alternative [[reading frame]] mutation in this gene leads to the destabilization of [[p53]], a [[transcription factor]] involved in [[apoptosis]] and in fifty percent of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of [[CDK4]], a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell division. Mutations that cause the skin condition [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] (XP) also seriously predispose one to melanoma. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell’s ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are ''highly penetrant'' (meaning that the chances of a person carrying the mutation to express the phenotype is very high).

Familial melanoma is genetically heterogeneous,<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Greene MH. | title = The genetics of hereditary melanoma and nevi | journal = Cancer | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 2464–77 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10630172 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991201)86:11 }}</ref> and loci for familial melanoma have been identified on the chromosome arms 1p, 9p and 12q.

Other mutations confer lower risk, but are more prevalent in the population. People with mutations in the MC1R gene, for example, are two to four times more likely to develop melanoma than those with two wild-type (typical unaffected type) copies of the gene. MC1R mutations are very common; in fact, all people with red hair have a mutated copy of the gene. Mutation of the MDM2 SNP309 gene is associated with increased risk of melanoma in younger women.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2678|url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1078-0432.CCR-08-2678v1 |last1=Firoz |journal=Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research |first1=EF |last2=Warycha |first2=M |last3=Zakrzewski |first3=J |last4=Pollens |first4=D |last5=Wang |first5=G |last6=Shapiro |first6=R |last7=Berman|first7=R |last8=Pavlick |first8=A |last9=Manga |first9=P |title=Association of MDM2 SNP309, Age of Onset, and Gender in Cutaneous Melanoma. |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=2573–80|year=2009 |pmid=19318491 }}</ref>

===UV radiation===
The UV radiation from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boniol|first=M|coauthors=Autier, P; Boyle, P; Gandini, S|title=Cutaneous melanoma attributable to sunbed use: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2012 Jul 24|volume=345|pages=e4757|pmid=22833605}}</ref> The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] finds that tanning beds are "carcinogenic to humans" with people who begin using tanning devices before age 30 75% more likely to develop melanoma.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Working Group |title=A Review of Human Carcinogens—Part D:Radiation |journal=[[The Lancet Oncology]]|date = August 2009| volume=10| issue=8| pages=751–2| doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70213-X| pmid=19655431}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

The earliest stage of melanoma starts when the melanocytes begin to grow out of control. Melanocytes are found between the outer layer of the skin (the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) and the next layer (the [[dermis]]). This early stage of the disease is called the radial growth phase, and the tumor is less than 1mm thick. Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels lower down in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage cancer will spread to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery.

When the tumor cells start to move in a different direction — vertically up into the epidermis and into the [[papillary dermis]] — the behaviour of the cells changes dramatically.<ref name=Hershkovitz10/>

The next step in the evolution is the invasive radial growth phase, which is a confusing term; however, it explains the next step in the process of the radial growth, when individual cells start to acquire invasive potential. This step is important – from this point on the melanoma is capable of spreading. The [[Breslow's depth]] of the lesion is usually less than{{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, the [[Clark level]] is usually 2.

The following step in the process is the invasive melanoma — the vertical growth phase (VGP). The tumor attains invasive potential, meaning it can grow into the surrounding tissue and can spread around the body through blood or [[lymph vessels]]. The tumor thickness is usually more than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, and the tumor involves the deeper parts of the dermis.

The host elicits an immunological reaction against the tumor (during the VGP),<ref>{{cite journal |title=ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part I. Abstract: Protective effect of a brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocyte infiltrate in melanoma: An EORTC melanoma group study |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=25 |issue=18S |page=8519 |year=2007|url=http://www.asco.org/ascov2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=47&abstractID=34439}}</ref> which is judged by the presence and activity of the [[tumor infiltrating lymphocyte]]s (TILs). These cells sometimes completely destroy the primary tumor; this is called regression, which is the latest stage of the melanoma development. In certain cases, the primary tumor is completely destroyed and only the metastatic tumor is discovered. ~40% of human melanomas contain activating mutations affecting the structure of the [[B-Raf]] protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to [[MAP kinase]] pathway.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Davies MA, Samuels Y | title = Analysis of the genome to personalize therapy for melanoma | journal = Oncogene | volume = 29 | issue = 41 | pages = 5545-55 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20697348 |doi = 10.1038/onc.2010.323 }}</ref>

[[File:Lymph node with almost complete replacement by metastatic melanoma.jpg|thumb|Lymph node with almost complete replacement by metastatic melanoma. The brown pigment is focal deposition of melanin]]
Visual diagnosis of melanomas is still the most common method employed by health professionals.<ref name="ap01">{{cite journal |author=Wurm EM, Soyer HP |title=Scanning for melanoma |year=2010 |month=October |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=150–5 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/5/150/5}}</ref> Moles that are irregular in color or shape are often treated as candidates of melanoma. The diagnosis of melanoma requires experience, as early stages may look identical to harmless moles or not have any color at all. People with a personal or family history of skin cancer or of [[dysplastic nevus syndrome]] (multiple atypical moles) should see a dermatologist at least once a year to be sure they are not developing melanoma. There is no blood test for detecting melanomas.

To detect melanomas (and increase survival rates), it is recommended to learn what they look like (see "ABCDE" mnemonic below), to be aware of [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]] and check for changes (shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) and to show any suspicious moles to a doctor with an interest and skills in skin malignancy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Prevention: ABCD's of Melanoma |publisher=American Melanoma Foundation |url=http://www.melanomafoundation.org/prevention/abcd.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| author = Friedman R, Rigel D, Kopf A | title = Early detection of malignant melanoma: the role of physician examination and self-examination of the skin | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 130–51 | year = 1985| pmid = 3921200 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.35.3.130/abstract | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.35.3.130}}</ref>

A popular method for remembering the signs and symptoms of melanoma is the mnemonic "ABCDE":
* ''A''symmetrical skin lesion.
* ''B''order of the lesion is irregular.
* ''C''olor: melanomas usually have multiple colors.
* ''D''iameter: moles greater than 6&nbsp;mm are more likely to be melanomas than smaller moles.
* ''E''nlarging: Enlarging or evolving

A weakness in this system is the diameter. Many melanomas present themselves as lesions smaller than 6&nbsp;mm in diameter; and all melanomas were malignant on day 1 of growth, which is merely a dot. An astute physician will examine all abnormal moles, including ones less than 6&nbsp;mm in diameter.  [[Seborrheic keratosis]] may meet some or all of the ABCD criteria, and can lead to [[false alarm]]s among laypeople and sometimes even physicians. An experienced doctor can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination, or with [[dermatoscopy]].

Some advocate the system "ABCDE",<ref>[http://www.aad.org/public/exams/abcde.html AAD.org]</ref> with E for evolution. Certainly moles that change and evolve will be a concern.  Alternatively, some refer to E as elevation. Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation does not mean that the lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas are detected in the very early stage, or in-situ stage, before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage.

[[Nodular melanoma]]s do not fulfill these criteria, having their own mnemonic, "EFG":

* ''E''levated: the lesion is raised above the surrounding skin.
* ''F''irm: the nodule is solid to the touch.
* ''G''rowing: the nodule is increasing in size.

A recent and novel method of melanoma detection is the "ugly duckling sign".<ref>[http://www.skincancer.org/the-ugly-duckling-sign.html SkinCancer.org]</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |author=Mascaro JM, Mascaro JM |title=The dermatologist's position concerning nevi: a vision ranging from "the ugly duckling" to "little red riding hood" |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=134 |issue=11 |pages=1484–5 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9828892 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9828892 |doi=10.1001/archderm.134.11.1484}}
</ref>  It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma. Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person's skin lesion is made. Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an "Ugly Duckling", and further professional exam is required. The "Little Red Riding Hood" sign<ref name="ReferenceA"/> suggests that individuals with fair skin and light-colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose amelanotic melanomas. Extra care and caution should be rendered when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect "ugly ducklings", as many melanomas in these individuals resemble non-melanomas or are considered to be "wolves in sheep clothing".<ref name="dermnetnz.org">[http://dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermoscopy-course/introduction.html Dermnetnz.org]</ref>  These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas which will not present easy-to-observe color changes and variation in colors. The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a dermatoscope very difficult.

Amelanotic melanomas and melanomas arising in fair-skinned individuals (see the "Little Red Riding Hood" sign) are very difficult to detect, as they fail to show many of the characteristics in the ABCD rule, break the "Ugly Duckling" sign, and are very hard to distinguish from acne scarring, insect bites, [[Benign fibrous histiocytoma|dermatofibromas]], or [[Lentigo|lentigines]].

Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam,<ref name="dermnetnz.org"/> or ''in vivo'' diagnostic tools such as a confocal microscope, the doctor may [[biopsy]] the suspicious mole. A [[skin biopsy]] performed under [[local anesthesia]] is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining the severity of the melanoma. If the mole is malignant, the mole and an area around it need excision. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. [[Skin biopsy#Punch biopsy|Punch biopsies]] are contraindicated in suspected melanomas, for fear of seeding tumor cells and hastening the spread of the malignant cells.

Total body photography, which involves photographic documentation of as much body surface as possible, is often used during follow-up of high-risk patients. The technique has been reported to enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (being possible with the use of any digital camera), but its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes.<ref name="ap01" /> The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.

* [[Uveal melanoma]]

===Laboratory===
[[Lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) tests are often used to screen for [[metastasis|metastases]], although many patients with metastases (even end-stage) have a normal LDH; extraordinarily high LDH often indicates metastatic spread of the disease to the liver. It is common for patients diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, and in some cases [[computed tomography|CT]], [[MRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and/or PET/CT scans. Although controversial, [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsies and examination of the [[lymph node]]s are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes. A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the [[S-100 protein]] marker.
[[HMB-45]] is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas, and stands for Human Melanoma Black. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors.
The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.
HMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the exception of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).

===Staging===
''Further context on [[cancer staging]] is available at [[TNM staging system|TNM]].''

Also of importance are the "[[Clark level]]" and "[[Breslow's depth]]", which refer to the microscopic depth of tumor invasion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Malignant Melanoma: staging |date=1 September 2006 |work=Collaborative Hypertext of Radiology |publisher=Medical College of Wisconsin |url=http://chorus.rad.mcw.edu/doc/00955.html}}</ref>

Melanoma stages:<ref name=AJCC />

'''Stage III''': Regional metastasis, 24–70% survival
*N1: Single positive lymph node
*N2: Two to three positive lymph nodes ''or'' regional skin/in-transit metastasis
*N3: Four positive lymph nodes ''or'' one lymph node and regional skin/in-transit metastases

'''Stage IV''': Distant metastasis, 7–19% survival
*M1a: Distant skin metastasis, normal [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]]

See [[Sunscreen controversy]] for further references and discussions.
Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can actually lead to an increased incidence of melanomas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clough-Gorr KM, Titus-Ernstoff L, Perry AE, Spencer SK, Ernstoff MS|title=Exposure to sunlamps, tanning beds, and melanoma risk |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=659–69|year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18273687 |doi=10.1007/s10552-008-9129-6 }}
</ref>  Even though tanning beds emit mostly UVA, which causes tanning, it by itself might be enough to induce melanomas.

A good rule of thumb for decreasing ultraviolet light exposure is to avoid the sun between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. or avoid the sun when one's shadow is shorter than one's height. These are rough rules, however, and can vary depending on locality and individual skin cancer risk.

Almost all melanomas start with altering the color and appearance of normal-looking skin. This area may be a dark spot or an abnormal new mole. Other melanomas form from a mole or freckle that is already present in the skin. It can be difficult to distinguish between a melanoma and a normal mole. When looking for danger signs in pigmented lesions of the skin, a few simple rules are often used.

==Treatment==
[[File:Malignant melanoma on chest.jpg|thumb|Extensive malignant melanoma on a patient's chest]]
Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is done with a [[skin biopsy]]. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy is done, as well, although controversy exists around trial evidence for this procedure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/sentinel-node-biopsy/sentinel-node-biopsy-false-positivity/ |title=The Sentinel Node Biopsy Procedure in Melanoma does not offer a survival advantage |publisher=Malignant Melanoma |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.

===Surgery===

Excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, but further surgery is often necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate [[surgical margin]]s and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a [[wide local excision]] (WLE) with 1 to 2&nbsp;cm margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 0.5&nbsp;cm.<ref>[http://www.labpath.com/new7.html LabPath.com]{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>  Many surgeons consider 0.5&nbsp;cm the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clark GS, Pappas-Politis EC, Cherpelis BS, ''et al.'' |title=Surgical management of melanoma in situ on chronically sun-damaged skin |journal=Cancer Control |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=216–24 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18596673 |format=PDF |url=http://www.moffitt.org/CCJRoot/v15n3/pdf/216.pdf}}</ref> but 0.2&nbsp;cm margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery ([[Mohs surgery]], or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Balch C, Urist M, Karakousis C, Smith T, Temple W, Drzewiecki K, Jewell W, Bartolucci A, Mihm M, Barnhill R | title = Efficacy of 2-cm surgical margins for intermediate-thickness melanomas (1 to 4 mm).

Melanomas that spread usually do so to the [[lymph nodes]] in the area of the tumor before spreading elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically ([[lymphadenectomy]]) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.<ref>[http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/surgery/lymph-node-dissection-surgery/ Malignant-Melanoma.org]</ref>

Although controversial and without prolonging survival, sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed, especially for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs. A process called [[lymphoscintigraphy]] is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer [[dye]], and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine [[H&E stain|hematoxylin and eosin]] (H&E) and [[immunoperoxidase]] staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement.  [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had a small number of positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a [[fine-needle aspiration]] biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.

If a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.
Excisional [[skin biopsy]] is the management of choice.   Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2&nbsp;mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Swanson N, Lee K, Gorman A, Lee H | title = Biopsy techniques. Diagnosis of melanoma | journal = Intensive 2011: The Third International Conference on Resource Intensive Applications and Services | volume = 20 | issue = 4 |pages = 677–80 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12380054 | doi = 10.1016/S0733-8635(02)00025-6}}</ref>  To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1&nbsp;mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the [[pathology|histopathologist]] to determine the thickness of the melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by [[Breslow's thickness]] (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5&nbsp;cm, 1.0&nbsp;cm, or 2&nbsp;cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and [[morbidity]] from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.

===Adjuvant treatment===
High-risk melanomas may require [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]] treatment, although attitudes to this vary in different countries. In the United States, most patients in otherwise good health will begin up to a year of high-dose [[interferon]] treatment, which has severe side effects, but may improve the patient's prognosis slightly.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kirkwood J, Strawderman M, Ernstoff M, Smith T, Borden E, Blum R | title = Interferon alfa-2b adjuvant therapy of high-risk resected cutaneous melanoma: the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial EST 1684 | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–17 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8558223}}</ref> However British Association of Dermatologist guidelines on melanoma state that interferon is not recommended as a standard adjuvant treatment for melanoma. <ref> [http://www.bad.org.uk/site/622/default.aspx], Guidelines for management of cutaneous melanoma 2010, J.R. Marsden et al.</ref> A 2011 meta-analysis showed that interferon could lengthen the time before a melanoma comes back but increased survival by only 3% at 5 years. The unpleasant side effects also greatly decrease quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wheatley K, Ives N, Eggermont A ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Adjuvant therapy for melanoma: an individual patient meta-analysis of randomised trials | url = | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 25 | issue = | page = 8526 }}</ref>

In Europe, interferon is usually not used outside the scope of clinical trials.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kirkwood J, Ibrahim J, Sondak V, Richards J, Flaherty L, Ernstoff M, Smith T, Rao U, Steele M, Blum R | title = High- and low-dose interferon alfa-2b in high-risk melanoma: first analysis of intergroup trial E1690/S9111/C9190 | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 2444–58 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10856105}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kirkwood J, Ibrahim J, Sondak V, Ernstoff M, Ross M | title = Interferon alfa-2a for melanoma metastases | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9310 | pages = 978–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11918944 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08001-7}}</ref>

===Chemotherapy and immunotherapy===
Various [[chemotherapy]] agents are used, including [[dacarbazine]] (also termed DTIC), [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]] (with [[interleukin-2]] (IL-2) or [[interferon]] (IFN)), as well as local perfusion, are used by different centers. The overall success in metastatic melanoma is quite limited.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bajetta E, Del Vecchio M, Bernard-Marty C, Vitali M, Buzzoni R, Rixe O, Nova P, Aglione S, Taillibert S, Khayat D | title = Metastatic melanoma: chemotherapy | journal = Semin Oncol | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 427–45 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12407508 | doi = 10.1053/sonc.2002.35238}}</ref> IL-2 ([[Proleukin]]) is the first new therapy approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 20 years.

Other chemotherapy options include [[ipilimumab]], [[vemurafenib]] and [[temozolomide]].

===Lentigo maligna treatment===

Standard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin, and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard "bread-loafing" technique of fixed tissue histology — result in a high "false negative" error rate, and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false negative errors. If [[bread loafing]] is used, distances from sections should approach 0.1&nbsp;mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control.

[[Mohs surgery]] has been done with cure rate reported to be as low as 77%,<ref name="Mikhail, G. Mohs Micrographic Surgery 1991, pp. 13"/> and as high as 95% by another author.<ref name=Bene08/> The "double scalpel" peripheral margin controlled excision method approximates the Mohs method in margin control, but requires a pathologist intimately familiar with the complexity of managing the vertical margin on the thin peripheral sections and staining methods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson TM, Headington JT, Baker SR, Lowe L |title=Usefulness of the staged excision for lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma: the "square" procedure |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=37 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=758–64 |year=1997 |month=November |pmid=9366823 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190-9622(97)70114-2 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(97)70114-2}}</ref>

Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ ([[lentigo maligna]]) have resolved with an experimental treatment,  [[imiquimod]] (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some dermasurgeons are combining the 2 methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating the area with Aldara cream postoperatively for three months.

===Radiation therapy===
[[Radiation therapy]] is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with unresectable distant metastases. It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bastiaannet E, Beukema J, Hoekstra H | title = Radiation therapy following lymph node dissection in melanoma patients: treatment, outcome and complications | journal = Cancer Treat Rev | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–26 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15707701 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2004.09.005}}</ref> [[Radioimmunotherapy]] of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation.
Radiotherapy has a role in the palliation of metastatic melanoma.<ref>{{cite book|coauthors=Boyer|others=Ford|title=Primary Care Oncology|year=1999}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
{{See also|Breslow's depth}}
Features that affect [[prognosis]] are [[tumor]] thickness in millimeters ([[Breslow's depth]]), depth related to skin structures ([[Clark level]]), type of melanoma, presence of ulceration, presence of lymphatic/[[perineural invasion]], presence of tumor-infiltrating [[lymphocyte]]s (if present, prognosis is better), location of lesion, presence of satellite lesions, and presence of regional or distant [[metastasis]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Homsi J, Kashani-Sabet M, Messina J, Daud A | title = Cutaneous melanoma: prognostic factors | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 223–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16258493 |url=https://www.moffitt.usf.edu/pubs/ccj/v12n4/pdf/223.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses but this is explained by their [[Breslow's depth|thickness]]. Interestingly, less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a [[wide local excision]] (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion.

When melanomas have spread to the [[lymph node]]s, one of the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; micrometastases in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macrometastases in which malignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is still worse.

When there is distant metastasis, the cancer is generally considered incurable. The five year survival rate is less than 10%.<ref name=AJCC>{{Cite journal| author = Balch C, Buzaid A, Soong S, Atkins M, Cascinelli N, Coit D, Fleming I, Gershenwald J, Houghton A, Kirkwood J, McMasters K, Mihm M, Morton D, Reintgen D, Ross M, Sober A, Thompson J, Thompson J | title = Final version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for cutaneous melanoma | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 19 | issue = 16 | pages = 3635–48 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11504745 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/content/full/19/16/3635}}</ref> The median survival is 6 to 12 months. Treatment is [[Palliative care|palliative]], focusing on life-extension and [[quality of life]]. In some cases, patients may live many months or even years with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver are associated with a worse prognosis.

There is not enough definitive evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft parts, or mucosal melanoma (e.g. rectal melanoma), although these tend to metastasize more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, it is impossible to know its original size and thus the original tumor is often worse than a [[Pathology|pathology report]] might indicate.

Generally, an individual's risk for developing melanoma depends on two groups of factors: intrinsic and environmental.<ref>[http://www.skincarephysicians.com/skincancernet/who_is_most.html Who is Most at Risk for Melanoma?]</ref> "Intrinsic" factors are generally an individual's family history and inherited [[genotype]], while the most relevant environmental factor is sun exposure.

[[Epidemiologic]] studies suggest that exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation (UVA<ref name="uva">{{Cite journal| author = Wang S, Setlow R, Berwick M, Polsky D, Marghoob A, Kopf A, Bart R | title = Ultraviolet A and melanoma: a review | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 837–46 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11312434 | doi = 10.1067/mjd.2001.114594}}</ref> and UVB) is one of the major contributors to the development of melanoma. UV radiation causes [[DNA damage|damage]] to the [[DNA]] of cells, typically [[thymine]] dimerization, which when unrepaired can create [[mutation]]s in the cell's [[gene]]s. When the cell [[cell division|divides]], these mutations are propagated to new generations of cells.

Possible significant elements in determining risk include the intensity and duration of sun exposure, the age at which sun exposure occurs, and the degree of [[skin pigmentation]].

==History==
Although melanoma is not a new disease, evidence for its occurrence in antiquity is rather scarce. However, one example lies in a 1960s examination of nine [[Peru]]vian mummies, [[radiocarbon]] dated to be approximately 2400 years old, which showed apparent signs of melanoma: melanotic masses in the skin and diffuse metastases to the bones.<!--

[[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] is reported to be the first to operate on metastatic melanoma in 1787. Although not knowing precisely what it was, he described it as a "cancerous fungous excrescence". The excised tumor was preserved in the [[Hunterian and Wellcome Museums|Hunterian Museum]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. It was not until 1968 that microscopic examination of the specimen revealed it to be an example of metastatic melanoma.<!--

The French physician [[René Laennec]] was the first to describe melanoma as a disease entity. His report was initially presented during a lecture for the Faculté de Médecine de Paris in 1804 and then published as a bulletin in 1806.<!--
  --><ref name="laennec">{{Cite journal| author = Laennec RTH | year = 1806 | title = Sur les melanoses | journal = Bulletin de la Faculte de Medecine de Paris | volume = 1 | pages = 24–26}}</ref>
The first English language report of melanoma was presented by an English general practitioner from Stourbridge, William Norris in 1820.<ref name="norris1">{{cite journal |author=Norris, W. |title=A case of fungoid disease |journal=Edinb. Med. Surg. J. |volume=16 |pages=562–5 |year=1820 }}</ref>  In his later work in 1857 he remarked that there is a familial predisposition for development of melanoma (''Eight Cases of Melanosis with Pathological and Therapeutical Remarks on That Disease'').

The first formal acknowledgment of advanced melanoma as untreatable came from [[Samuel Cooper (surgeon)|Samuel Cooper]] in 1840. He stated that the only chance for benefit depends upon the early removal of the disease ...'<ref name="cooper">{{Cite book| last = Cooper | first = Samuel | title = First lines of theory and practice of surgery | publisher = Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longman | year = 1840 | location = London}}</ref>  More than one and a half centuries later this situation remains largely unchanged.

==Research==
Pharmacotherapy research for unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma offers new treatment possibilities.<ref name=" melanoma2012"/> In addition to the advances with recently approved agents, ongoing research into combination therapy, such as dabrafenib and trametinib, may reveal a more effective and better-tolerated option for patients with metastatic melanoma. One important pathway in [[melanin]] synthesis involves the transcription factor [[Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor|MITF]]. The [[MITF gene]] is highly conserved and is found in people, mice, birds, and even fish. MITF production is regulated via a fairly straightforward pathway.  [[UV radiation]] causes increased expression of transcription factor [[p53]] in [[keratinocytes]], and p53 causes these cells to produce [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (MSH), which binds to [[melanocortin 1 receptor]]s (MC1R) on [[melanocytes]]. Ligand-binding at MC1R receptors activates [[adenylate cyclase]]s, which produce [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], which activates [[CREB]], which promote MITF expression. The targets of MITF include [[p16 (gene)|p16]] (a [[CDK inhibitor]]) and [[Bcl2]], a gene essential to melanocyte survival. It is often difficult to design drugs that interfere with transcription factors, but perhaps new drugs will be discovered that can impede some reaction in the pathway upstream of MITF.

Studies of [[chromatin]] structure also promise to shed light on transcriptional regulation in melanoma cells. It has long been assumed that [[nucleosomes]] are positioned randomly on [[DNA]], but [[murine]] studies of genes involved in melanin production now suggest that nucleosomes are stereotypically positioned on DNA.   When a gene is undergoing transcription, its transcription start site is almost always nucleosome-free. When the gene is silent, however, nucleosomes often block the transcriptional start site, suggesting that nucleosome position may play a role in gene regulation.

Finally, given the fact that melanin helps protect skin cells from UV-induced damage, new melanoma prevention strategies could involve attempts to induce melanin synthesis in individuals who would otherwise get sunburns. Redheads, for example, do not tan because they have MC1R mutations. In mice, it has been shown that the melanin production pathway can be rescued downstream of MC1R.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A study published on January 27, 2011, by M. Raza Zaidi et al. shows that interferon-γ links ultraviolet radiation to melanomagenesis in mice. Using a mouse model that allowed the visual tracking and purification of melanocytes using a green fluorescent dye, data showed that UVB-induced, macrophage-enhanced interferon-γ release results in melanoma growth, proliferation and immunoevasion. Based on these results, the interferon-γ pathway can potentially serve as part of new therapeutic measures to treat patients suffering from malignant melanoma, as well as a potential preventive strategy against UV-induced radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zaidi MR, Davis S, Noonan FP, ''et al.'' |title=Interferon-γ links ultraviolet radiation to melanomagenesis in mice |journal=Nature |volume=469 |issue=7331 |pages=548–53 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21248750 |doi=10.1038/nature09666 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7331/full/nature09666.html}}</ref>

===BRAF===
About 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the [[BRAF (gene)|B-Raf gene]]. Early clinical trials suggested that B-Raf inhibitors including Plexxicon's [[vemurafenib]] could lead to substantial tumor regression in a majority of patients if their tumor contain the B-Raf mutation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/health/research/22trial.html? | work=The New York Times | title=A Roller Coaster Chase for a Cure | first=Amy | last=Harmon | date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>  In June 2011, a large [[clinical trial]] confirmed the positive findings from those earlier trials.<ref name="studies">{{cite newspaper |publisher=New York Times|author=Andrew Pollack |date=June 5, 2011 |title=Drugs Show Promise Slowing Advanced Melanoma|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/health/research/06melanoma.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chapman PB, Hauschild A, Robert C, ''et al.'' |title=Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation |journal=N.

In June 2012 a study reported that patients taking a different [[B-Raf inhibitor]], [[Dabrafenib]], did better than patients taking a chemotherapy agent.
<ref>{{cite newspaper|publisher=Medical News Today|author=Christian Nordqvist|date=04 Jun 2012|title=Dabrafenib And Trametinib For Metastatic Melanoma Meet Primary Endpoints In Phase III Studies|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/246163.php}}</ref>

Some researchers believe that combination therapies that simultaneously block multiple pathways may improve efficacy by making it more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed.  In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a [[MEK inhibitor]] [[trametinib]] led to even better outcomes.  Compared to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median [[progression-free survival]] increased to 9.4 months versus 5.8 months.  Some side effects were, however, increased in the combined study.

===Ipilimumab===
At the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] Conference in June 2010, the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] pharmaceutical company reported the clinical findings of their drug [[ipilimumab]]. The study found an increase in median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one year survival rate of 25% in the control group using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone.<ref>{{cite news | title = Bristol drug cuts death risk in advanced melanoma | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0218461520100605 | work=Reuters | date=June 5, 2010}}</ref> However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/06/bristol-myers-melanoma-med-and-wall-street-wags/ |title=Bristol-Myers’ Melanoma Med And Wall Street Wags // Pharmalot |publisher=Pharmalot.com |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/06/the-risk-for-bristol/ |work=Forbes | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100609/Phase-3-clinical-study-Ipilimumab-boosts-sustains-immune-system-responses-against-melanoma-tumors.aspx |title=Phase 3 clinical study: Ipilimumab boosts, sustains immune system responses against melanoma tumors |publisher=News-medical.net |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.

In June 2011, a clinical trial of ipilimumab plus [[dacarbazine]] combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful that perhaps 10–20% of patients could live a long time. Some serious side-effects of revving up the immune system were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug's brandname is Yervoy.<ref name="studies"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Robert C, Thomas L, Bondarenko I, ''et al.'' |title=Ipilimumab plus dacarbazine for previously untreated metastatic melanoma |journal=N.
