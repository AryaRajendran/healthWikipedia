</ref>  The injury can cause a decline in mental function in the long term and in the emergency setting may result in [[brain herniation]], a life-threatening condition in which parts of the brain are squeezed past parts of the skull.<ref name="Khoshyomn04"/> Thus treatment aims to prevent dangerous rises in [[intracranial pressure]], the pressure within the skull.

Contusions are likely to heal on their own without medical intervention.<ref>Sanders MJ and McKenna K. 2001. ''Mosby’s Paramedic Textbook'', 2nd revised Ed. Chapter 22, "Head and Facial Trauma." Mosby.</ref>  It is possible to relieve symptoms by way of neurotherapies such as Neurofeedback.<ref>http://internationalbrain.org/?q=node/88</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of a cerebral contusion (bruising on the brain) depend on the severity of the injury, ranging from minor to severe. Individuals may experience a headache; confusion; sleepiness; dizziness; loss of consciousness; nausea and vomiting; seizures; and difficulty with coordination and movement. They may also have difficulty with memory, vision, speech, hearing, managing emotions, and thinking.<ref name="Kushner98">

==Causes==
[[Image:Schädelbasis1.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The interior of the skull has sharp ridges by which a moving brain can be injured.]]
Often caused by a blow to the head, contusions commonly occur in [[coup contrecoup injury|coup or contre-coup injuries]]. In coup injuries, the brain is injured directly under the area of impact, while in contrecoup injuries it is injured on the side opposite the impact.

Contusions occur primarily in the [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] tissue, especially under the site of impact or in areas of the brain located near sharp ridges on the inside of the skull.  The brain may be contused when it collides with bony protuberances on the inside surface of the skull.<ref name="RaoLyketsos">

==Features==
Contusions, which are frequently associated with [[edema]], are especially likely to cause increases in [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) and concomitant crushing of delicate brain tissue.

Contusions typically form in a wedge-shape with the widest part in the outermost part of the brain.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis">Vinas FC and Pilitsis J. 2006. [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2888.htm "Penetrating Head Trauma."] Emedicine.com. Retrieved on  2008-01-10.</ref>

The distinction between contusion and [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] is blurry because both involve bleeding within the brain tissue; however, an arbitrary cutoff exists that the injury is a contusion if two thirds or less of the tissue involved is blood and a hemorrhage otherwise.<ref name="Khoshyomn04"/>

The contusion may cause swelling of the surrounding brain tissue, which may be irritated by toxins released in the contusion.<ref name="Khoshyomn04"/>  The swelling is worst at around four to six days after the injury.<ref name="Khoshyomn04"/>

Extensive contusion associated with [[subdural hematoma]] is called [[burst lobe]].<ref name="Gennarelli04"/>  Cases of a burst frontal or temporal lobe are associated with high [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]].<ref name="Gennarelli04"/>

Old or remote contusions are associated with resorption of the injured tissue, resulting in various degrees of cavitation, in addition to the presence of a golden-yellow discoloration due to residual hemosiderin. These remote contusions are often referred to as ''[[plaque jaune]]'' or [[yellow plaque]].<ref>http://kobiljak.msu.edu/CAI/Pathology/Trauma_F/Trauma_3.html</ref>

==Multiple petechial hemorrhages==
Numerous small contusions from broken capillaries that occur in grey matter under the cortex are called [[multiple petechial hemorrhage]]s or [[multifocal hemorrhagic contusion]].<ref name="GE Healthcare">{{Medcyclopaedia|vi_1/b/BRAIN_INJURY_TRAUMATIC}}</ref>  Caused by [[shearing injury|shearing injuries]] at the time of impact, these contusions occur especially at the junction between grey and white matter and in the upper [[brain stem]], [[basal ganglia]], [[thalamus]] and areas near the third [[ventricular system|ventricle]].<ref name="GE Healthcare"/>  The hemorrhages can occur as the result of [[brain herniation]], which can cause arteries to tear and bleed.<ref name="GE Healthcare"/>  A type of [[diffuse brain injury]], multiple petechial hemorrhages are not always visible using current imaging techniques like CT and [[MRI]] scans. This may be the case even if the injury is quite severe, though these may show up days after the injury.<ref name="Downie">Downie A. 2001. [http://www.radiology.co.uk/srs-x/tutors/cttrauma/tutor.htm "Tutorial: CT in Head Trauma"].  Retrieved May 8, 2008</ref> Hemorrhages may be larger than in normal contusions if the injury is quite severe. This type of injury has a poor prognosis if the patient is [[coma]]tose, even with no apparent causes for the coma.<ref name="Downie"/>

==Treatment==

[[Image:Brain injury with herniation MRI.jpg|thumb|right|MRI showing damage due to herniation in a patient who had had contusions in the frontal lobes.<ref name="Rehman08">{{cite journal |author=Rehman T, Ali R, Tawil I, Yonas H |title=Rapid progression of traumatic bifrontal contusions to transtentorial herniation: A case report |journal=Cases journal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=203 |year=2008 |pmid=18831756 |pmc=2566562 |doi=10.1186/1757-1626-1-203 |url= http://www.casesjournal.com/content/1/1/203}}</ref>]]
Since cerebral swelling presents a danger to the patient, treatment of cerebral contusion aims to prevent swelling.  Measures to avoid swelling include prevention of [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), [[hyponatremia]] (insufficient sodium), and [[hypercapnia]] (increased [[carbon dioxide]] in the blood).<ref name="Khoshyomn04"/> Due to the danger of increased intracranial pressure, surgery may be necessary to reduce it.<ref name="Khoshyomn04"/> People with cerebral contusion may require [[intensive care]] and close monitoring.<ref name="Khoshyomn04"/>
