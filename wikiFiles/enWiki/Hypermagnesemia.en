'''Hypermagnesemia''' is an [[electrolyte disturbance]] in which there is an abnormally elevated level of [[magnesium]] in the blood.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000051070|hypermagnesemia}}</ref> Usually this results in excess of magnesium in the body.  

Hypermagnesemia occurs rarely because the [[kidney]] is very effective in excreting excess magnesium. It usually develops only in people with kidney failure who are given magnesium salts or who take drugs that contain magnesium (e.g. some [[antacid]]s and [[laxative]]s).  It is usually concurrent with [[hypocalcemia]] and/or [[hyperkalemia]].

==Metabolism==
For a detailed description of magnesium [[homeostasis]] and [[metabolism]] see [[hypomagnesemia]].

==Symptoms==
* Weakness, nausea and vomiting
* Impaired breathing
* Decreased respirations
* [[Hypotension]]
* [[Hypercalcemia]]
* [[Arrhythmia]] and [[Asystole]]
* Decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes
* [[Bradycardia]]

Arrhythmia and asystole are possible cardiac complications of hypermagnesemia.  Magnesium acts as physiologic [[Calcium channel blocker|calcium blocker]], which results in electrical conduction abnormalities.    

Clinical consequences related to serum concentration:
*4.0 mEq/l            [[hyporeflexia]]
*>5.0 mEq/l            Prolonged atrioventricular conduction
*>10.0 mEq/l           Complete [[heart block]]
*>13.0 mEq/l           [[Cardiac arrest]]

Note that the therapeutic range for the prevention of the pre-eclampsic uterine contractions is: 4.0-7.0 mEq/L.<ref>Pritchard JA. The use of the magnesium ion in the management of eclamptogenic toxemias. Surg Gynecol Obstet. 1955; 100:131–140</ref> As per Lu and Nightingale,<ref>Lu JF,Nightingale CH. Magnesium sulfate in eclampsia and pre-eclampsia. Clin Pharmacokinet. 2000; 38:305–314</ref> serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations associated with maternal toxicity (also neonate depression - hypotonia and low Apgar scores) are:
*  7.0-10.0 mEq/L - loss of [[patellar reflex]]
* 10.0-13.0 mEq/L - respiratory depression
* 15.0-25.0 mEq/L - altered atrioventricular conduction and (further) complete [[heart block]]
*     >25.0 mEq/L - [[cardiac arrest]]

===Hypermagnesemia in renal failure===

An evaluation of 515 patients on [[hemodialysis]] demonstrated that serum [[magnesium]] concentration lower than 2.77&nbsp;mg/dL (1.14&nbsp;mmol/L) is a significant predictor for increased all-cause mortality. While the mean serum magnesium concentration of this study population (2.77&nbsp;mg/dL or 1.14&nbsp;mmol/L) would be considered indicative of mild hypermagnesemia in the healthy population, serum magnesium concentrations in hemodialysis patients may be optimal at a higher concentration, in view of better survival under hemodialysis conditions, without causing severe and symptomatic hypermagnesemia.<ref name= Ishimura2007 >{{cite journal |author= Ishimura E, Okuno S, Yamakawa T et al. |title= Serum magnesium concentration is a significant predictor of mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients |journal = Magnes Res |volume=20 |pages=237–244 |year=2007 |doi= 10.1684/mrh.2007.0116 |pmid= 18271493 |url= http://www.jle.com/e-docs/00/04/37/D9/vers_alt/VersionPDF.pdf }}</ref> Consistently, lower magnesium levels were significantly associated with the presence of vascular [[calcification]] of the hand arteries in a study investigating 390 nondiabetic hemodialysis patients.

==Causes==
Magnesium status depends on three organs: uptake in the [[intestine]], storage in the [[bone]] and excretion in the [[kidneys]]. Hypermagnesemia is therefore often due to problems in these organs, mostly intestine or kidney.<ref name= Jahnen-Dechent2012 >{{cite journal |author= Jahnen-Dechent W, Ketteler M |title= Magnesium basics |journal= Clin Kidney J |volume=5 |issue= Suppl 1 |pages= i3–i14 |year=2012 |doi=10.1093/ndtplus/sfr163|url= http://ckj.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/Suppl_1/i3.full.pdf}}</ref>

===Predisposing conditions===
*[[Haemolysis]], magnesium concentration in erythrocytes is approximately three times greater than in serum, therefore hemolysis can increase plasma magnesium. Hypermagnesemia is expected only in massive hemolysis.
*[[Renal insufficiency]], excretion of magnesium becomes impaired when [[creatinine clearance]] falls below 30 ml/min. However, hypermagnesemia is not a prominent feature of renal insufficiency unless magnesium intake is increased.
*Other conditions that can predispose to mild hypermagnesemia are [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[adrenal insufficiency]], [[hyperparathyroidism]] and [[lithium]] [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]].

==Therapy==
Prevention of hypermagnesemia usually is possible. In mild cases, withdrawing magnesium supplementation is often sufficient. In more severe cases the following treatments are used:
* [[Intravenous]] [[calcium gluconate]], because the actions of [[magnesium]] in [[neuromuscular]] and [[cardiac]] function are antagonized by [[calcium]].

Definitive treatment of hypermagnesemia requires increasing renal magnesium excretion through:
* Intravenous [[diuretic]]s, in the presence of normal [[renal function]]
* [[Dialysis]], when kidney function is impaired and the patient is symptomatic from hypermagnesemia
