'''Craniosynostosis''' (from ''cranio'', [[cranium]]; + ''syn'', together; + ''ostosis'' relating to bone) is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous [[Suture (joint)|sutures]] in an infant skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone (ossification),<ref>{{cite web

==Cranial sutures==
[[File:The sutures.jpg|thumb|upright0.80|The sutures]]
The [[mesenchyme]] above the [[meninges]] undergoes [[intramembranous ossification]] forming the [[neurocranium]].<ref name="Brief Review"/> The neurocranium consists of several bones, which are united and at the same time separated by fibrous sutures.<ref name="Brief Review"/> This allows movement of the separate bones in relation to one another; the infant skull is still malleable.<ref name="Brief Review"/> The fibrous sutures specifically allow the deformation of the skull during birth<ref name="Brief Review"/> and absorb mechanical forces during childhood<ref name="genetics"/> They also allow the necessary expansion during brain growth.<ref name="Brief Review"/>

In the very first years of life the sutures serve as the most important centers of growth in the skull.<ref name="Brief Review"/> 
The growth of the brain and the patency of the sutures depend on each other.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis">{{cite journal |author=Panchal J, Uttchin V |title=Management of craniosynostosis |journal=Plast.

This will occur for example when the intracranial pressure drops; the sutures do not experience stretching anymore causing them to fuse.<ref name="Pansynostosis">{{cite journal |author=Blount JP, Louis RG, Tubbs RS, Grant JH |title=Pansynostosis: a review |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=1103–9 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17486351 |doi=10.1007/s00381-007-0362-1 }}</ref>

The infant's skull consists of the [[metopic suture]], [[coronal sutures]], [[sagittal suture]], and [[lambdoid suture]]s.<ref name="Brief Review"/> The metopic suture is supposed to close between three to nine months of age.<ref name="cunningham"/> The lambdoid, sagittal and coronal sutures are supposed to close between 22 to 39 months of age.<ref name="cunningham"/>

==Epidemiology==

It is estimated that craniosynostosis affects 1 in 2,000 to 2,500 live births worldwide.<ref name="Brief Review"/> Sagittal synostosis is the most common [[phenotype]], representing 40 to 55% of nonsyndromic cases.<ref name="Brief Review"/> The second most common type is the coronal synostosis representing 20 to 25%.<ref name="Brief Review"/> The metopic synostosis comes third with 5 to 15% and the lambdoid synostosis is only seen in 0 to 5% of nonsyndromic cases.<ref name="Brief Review"/> 

In about 5 to 15% more than one suture is affected, which referred to as complex craniosynostosis. This is generally part of a syndrome.<ref name="Brief Review"/>

==Causes of premature fusion==

Advances in the fields of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], as well as the use of animal models have been of great importance in expanding our knowledge of suture fusion.<ref name="Brief Review"/> Research in animal models has led to the idea that the [[dura mater]] plays an important role in determining closure or patency of the suture.<ref name="Brief Review"/> In contrast to the dura mater it appears that the [[periosteum]] is not essential in causing closure or patency.<ref name="Brief Review"/>

Instead of describing the abnormalities in structure and form, research focuses nowadays at decoding the molecular interactions that underlie them.<ref name="Brief Review"/>
Despite the progress that has been made, many things are still not understood about the suture biology and the exact causative pathways remain yet to be completely understood.

Multiple potential causes of premature suture closure have been identified, such as the several genetic mutations that are associated with syndromic craniosynostosis.<ref name="Brief Review"/>
The cause of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis however, is still greatly unknown.<ref name="Neurodevelopment">{{cite journal |author=Kapp-Simon KA, Speltz ML, Cunningham ML, Patel PK, Tomita T |title=Neurodevelopment of children with single suture craniosynostosis: a review |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=269–81 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17186250 |doi=10.1007/s00381-006-0251-z }}</ref> 
Most likely, a role is played by biomechanical factors, as well as environmental, hormonal and genetical factors.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/>

===Biomechanical factors===
Biomechanical factors include fetal head constraint during pregnancy.<ref name="Expression of Indian Hedgehog">{{cite journal |author=Jacob S, Wu C, Freeman TA, Koyama E, Kirschner RE |title=Expression of Indian Hedgehog, BMP-4 and Noggin in craniosynostosis induced by fetal constraint |journal=Ann Plast Surg |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=215–21 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17245153 |doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000232833.41739.a5 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-7043&volume=58&issue=2&spage=215}}</ref> It has been found by Jacob et al. that constraint inside the womb is associated with decreased expression of [[IHH (Protein)|Indian Hedgehog protein]] and [[noggin (protein)|noggin]]. These last two are both important factors influencing bone development.<ref name="Expression of Indian Hedgehog"/>

===Environmental factors===
Environmental factors refer for example to [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal smoking]] and the maternal exposure to amine-containing drugs. Several research groups have found evidence that these environmental factors are responsible for an increase in the risk of craniosynostosis, likely through effects on fibroblast growth factor receptor genes.<ref name="Carmicheal SL et al.c">{{cite journal |author=Carmichael SL, Ma C, Rasmussen SA, Honein MA, Lammer EJ, Shaw GM |title=Craniosynostosis and maternal smoking |journal=Birth Defects Res.

On the other hand, a recent evaluation of [[valproic acid]] (an anti-epilepticum), which has been implicated as a causative agent, has shown no association with craniosynostosis.<ref name="Valproic">{{cite journal |author=Jentink J, Loane MA, Dolk H, ''et al.'' |title=Valproic acid monotherapy in pregnancy and major congenital malformations |journal=N.

===Hormonal factors===

===Genetic factors===
In 6 to 11% of the children born with coronal synostosis, more often involving the bilateral cases than unilateral, other members of the family have been reported that were also born with the same condition.<ref name="Molecular analysisc">{{cite journal |author=Mulliken JB, Gripp KW, Stolle CA, Steinberger D, Müller U |title=Molecular analysis of patients with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly (unilateral coronal synostosis) |journal=Plast.

Fibroblast growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors regulate fetal bone growth and are expressed in cranial sutures during pregnancy.<ref name="genetics"/>
The transcription factor gene TWIST is thought to decrease the function of FGFR, thus also indirectly regulating fetal bone growth.<ref name="genetics"/> A relation between the mutations in these genes and craniosynostosis is therefore possible.
Moloney et al. observed a FGFR3 mutation in as many as 31% of the cases with nonsyndromic coronal synostosis, thus showing that FGFR abnormalities play an important role in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis.<ref name="Prevalence of">{{cite journal |author=Moloney DM, Wall SA, Ashworth GJ, ''et al.'' |title=Prevalence of Pro250Arg mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 in coronal craniosynostosis |journal=Lancet |volume=349 |issue=9058 |pages=1059–62 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=9107244 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673696090824}}</ref>

In terms of syndromic craniosynostosis not only do FGFR3 and TWIST genes feature, but also FGFR1 and in particular [[FGFR2]], which has been reported in 90% of the syndromic craniosynostoses such as Apert, Crouzon, Peiffer and Jackson-Weiss <ref name="pmid18391498">{{cite journal | author = Passos-Bueno MR | title = Genetics of Craniosynostosis: genes, syndromes, mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations | journal = Front Oral Biol | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–43 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18391498 | doi =  10.1159/0000115035 | last2 = Serti Eacute | first2 = AE | last3 = Jehee | first3 = FS | last4 = Fanganiello | first4 = R | last5 = Yeh | first5 = E }}</ref><ref name="Cranial suture biology">{{cite journal |author=Lenton KA, Nacamuli RP, Wan DC, Helms JA, Longaker MT |title=Cranial suture biology |journal=Curr.

===Discussion===
New insights have given fuel to a debate whether there might be an intrinsic factor causing the premature fusion of the sutures. Brain structures of children with craniosynostosis were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/> Differences were seen compared with the brain structures of normal children.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/> The question now is whether these differences are caused by the craniosynostosis, or are the cause of craniosynostosis.

==Classification==

There are several ways to classify craniosynostosis. 

* For example, one can consider the number of closed sutures. If only one of the four sutures is prematurely closed (single suture craniosynostosis), the craniosynostosis is referred to as ‘simple’ (or ‘isolated’). Whereas when two or more sutures are no longer open, the craniosynostosis is ‘complex’.<ref name="genetics"/>

* A second classification scheme gives a clinical description of the resulting shape of the skull. This will be further discussed under phenotype.

* A third classification involves the presence or absence of an identified craniofacial syndrome. Craniosynostosis where no extracranial deformations are present, is called non-syndromic or ‘isolated’  craniosynostosis.<ref name="genetics"/> When there are extracranial deformations present, for instance involving the limbs,  heart, central nervous system or the respiratory tract,<ref name="cunningham"/> you may speak of a syndromic form of craniosynostosis. More than 180 identified [[syndromes]] show deformations due to craniosynostosis.<ref name="genetics"/> The following syndromes are associated with [[fibroblast growth factor receptor]]s:

==Phenotype==

Children born with craniosynostosis have a distinct appearance, otherwise known as the [[phenotype]]. The features of the phenotype are determined by which particular suture is closed.<ref name="Kabbani H">{{cite journal |author=Kabbani H, Raghuveer TS |title=Craniosynostosis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=69 |issue=12 |pages=2863–70 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15222651 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=15222651}}</ref> The fusion of this suture causes a certain change in the shape of the skull; a deformity of the skull.<ref name="Kabbani H"/> 

Virchow’s law dictates that, when premature suture closure occurs, growth of the skull is typically restricted perpendicular to the fused suture and enhanced in a plane parallel to it, thus trying to provide space for the fast growing brain.<ref name="Cranial vault growth">{{cite journal |author=Delashaw JB, Persing JA, Broaddus WC, Jane JA |title=Cranial vault growth in craniosynostosis |journal=J. Neurosurg. |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=159–65 |year=1989 |month=February |pmid=2913214 |doi=10.3171/jns.1989.70.2.0159 |url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/jns.1989.70.2.0159?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref> Using this law, the pattern of skull deformity in craniosynostosis can often be predicted.<ref name="Cranial vault growth"/>

===Scaphocephaly===
An illustrative example of this phenomenon is scaphocephaly; the name providing a direct hint regarding the deformity of the skull. The literal meaning of the Greek derived word ‘scaphocephaly’ is boathead. A synonymous term is 'dolichocephaly' (the prefix dolicho- means elongated).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Agrawal D, Steinbok P, Cochrane DD |title=Scaphocephaly or dolichocephaly? |journal=J. Neurosurg. |volume=102 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=253–4; author reply 254 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=16156241 |doi=10.3171/jns.2005.102.2.0253 |url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/jns.2005.102.2.0253 }}</ref> Premature sagittal suture closure restricts growth in a perpendicular plane, thus the head will not grow sideways and remain narrow.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al">{{cite journal |author=Persing JA |title=MOC-PS(SM) CME article: management considerations in the treatment of craniosynostosis |journal=Plast.

===Trigonocephaly===
[[Trigonocephaly]] is a result from the premature closure of the metopic suture.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Using Virchow’s law again to predict the resulting deformity, this fusion will result in a narrow forehead, which is even further emphasized by ridging of the suture.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Compensatory growth occurs at both the coronal sutures, thereby pushing the forehead forwards.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/>
The resulting shape can best be assessed from a top view again, which will reveal a somewhat triangular form of the head.<ref name="cunningham"/> Trigonocephaly is also a Greek derived word, which can be translated as triangular shaped head. A facial feature of metopic synostosis is [[hypotelorism]]; in the frontal view, it can be seen that the width between the eyes is smaller than usual.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

===Plagiocephaly===

The Greek word plagios means skew. Plagiocephaly can be subclassified in [[Anterior]] Plagiocephaly and [[Posterior (anatomy)|Posterior]] Plagiocephaly.

Anterior plagiocephaly is a clinical description of unilateral coronal synostosis.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Children born with unilateral coronal synostosis develop due to compensatory mechanisms a skew head; a plagiocephaly.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/>

The sagittal suture ‘divides’ the coronal suture in two halves; unilateral meaning that either the right side or the left side to the sagittal suture is fused. This fact immediately raises an important point. Unlike closure of the sagittal or the metopic suture, right and left are not the same in unilateral coronal synostosis.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> This asymmetry shows in the skull deformity, as well as in the facial deformity and the complications.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/>

This time, the skull deformity can only partly be predicted using Virchow’s law. Growth is arrested in the plane perpendicular to the fused suture and the forehead is flattened, but only at the ipsilateral side of the head.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Ipsilateral indicates the same side of the head as where the suture is closed.
Compensatory growth occurs in a parallel plane, as well as in a perpendicular plane.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> An increase in growth at the metopic and the sagittal suture accounts for the parallel plane and will result in bulging at the [[temporal fossa]] and an increase in width of the skull.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Compensatory growth in the perpendicular plane occurs on the side of the head with the patent coronal suture, the contralateral side.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Half of the forehead will bulge forwards as a result.

Assessment of the skull from a top view shows asymmetry of the frontal bones, an increased width of the skull and a forward displacement of the ear at the ipsilateral side of the head.<ref name="cunningham"/> Assessment of the skull from a frontal view will show asymmetrical features of the face, including a displacement of the chin point of the jaw and a deviation of the tip of the nose.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> The chin point is located more to the contralateral side of the head, due to the ipsilateral forward displacement of the [[temporomandibular joint]] together with the ear.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> The tip of the nose will also point towards the contralateral side.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Complications based on the skull deformation include malocclusion of the jaw and in as many as 90% — a subtle form of — [[strabismus]], the last being caused by the asymmetrical placement of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]s.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

====Posterior Plagiocephaly====

Unilateral lambdoid synostosis is also called posterior plagiocephaly, indicating that this gives, just like unilateral coronal synostosis, a ‘skew head’. The difference is that this time, the deformity mostly shows at the [[occiput]].

Remembering Virchow’s law, restriction of growth will occur at the ipsilateral side of the head; compensatory growth will occur at the contralateral side of the head. This growth pattern exerts an effect at the base of the skull, which is not even when the child is assessed from a point of view standing behind the child, as well as on the cervical spine, which shows a curvature.<ref name="Huang">{{cite journal |author=Huang MH, Gruss JS, Clarren SK, ''et al.'' |title=The differential diagnosis of posterior plagiocephaly: true lambdoid synostosis versus positional molding |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=765–74; discussion 775–6 |year=1996 |month=October |pmid=8823012 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=98&issue=5&spage=765}}</ref> In addition, an asymmetry of the ears can be seen, with the ear on the ipsilateral side placed further to the back. Also, again from a point of view standing behind the child, a bulging of the mastoid can be seen.<ref name="Huang"/>
Minimal forehead asymmetries are typically seen.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

====Brachycephaly====
Brachycephaly, or a ‘short head’, is the result of a closure of both the coronal sutures.<ref name="Persing et al"/> Following Virchow’s law, this will result in a child’s head with a restriction of growth in the forward direction and in the backward direction; recessed frontal bones and a flattened occiput.<ref name="Persing et al"/> Compensatory growth will occur sideways, due to the sagittal suture, and upwards, due to the lambdoid sutures.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

===Oxycephaly===
[[Oxycephaly]], also known as turricephaly and high-head syndrome, is a type of cephalic disorder. This is a term sometimes used to describe the premature closure of the coronal suture plus any other suture, like the lambdoid,

====Pansynostosis====

The word pansynostosis is also Greek derived and can be translated as ‘all one bone’, indicating that all of the sutures are closed.<ref name="Chumas PD">{{cite journal |author=Chumas PD, Cinalli G, Arnaud E, Marchac D, Renier D |title=Classification of previously unclassified cases of craniosynostosis |journal=J. Neurosurg. |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=177–81 |year=1997 |month=February |pmid=9010415 |doi=10.3171/jns.1997.86.2.0177 |url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/jns.1997.86.2.0177?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref> In general practice, the term is used to describe the children with three or more sutures closed.<ref name="Chumas PD"/> 

Pansynostosis can present in several ways. The appearance can be the same as that seen with primary [[microcephaly]]: a markedly small head, but with normal proportions.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> However, pansynostosis can also appear as a Kleeblattschädel (cloverleaf skull), which presents with bulging of the different bones of the cranial vault.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> The condition is associated with thanatophoric dwarfism.

==Diagnosis and preoperative assessment==
The evaluation of a child suspected to have craniosynostosis is preferentially performed in a craniofacial center. The three main elements of analysis include medical history, physical examination and [[radiographic]] analysis.

===Medical history===
Medical history should in any case include questions about risk factors during pregnancy, the familial rate and the presence of symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).

====Risk factors during pregnancy====
* Certain medication (like amine-containing drugs) can increase the risk of craniosynostosis when taken during pregnancy, these are so-called [[teratogenic]] factors.<ref name="Gardner"/><ref name="Olshan"/>

====The familial rate====

* The familial rate, which is different for nonsyndromic and syndromic cases, provides an important clue.<ref name="Hunter">{{cite journal |author=Hunter AG, Rudd NL |title=Craniosynostosis. I. Sagittal synostosis: its genetics and associated clinical findings in 214 patients who lacked involvement of the coronal suture(s) |journal=Teratology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=185–93 |year=1976 |month=October |pmid=982314 |doi=10.1002/tera.1420140209 }}</ref><ref name="Lajeunie">{{cite journal |author=Lajeunie E, Le Merrer M, Bonaïti-Pellie C, Marchac D, Renier D |title=Genetic study of scaphocephaly |journal=Am.

====Symptoms of elevated ICP====

* Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure – such as headache and vomiting – should be questioned after.<ref name="Tamburrini">{{cite journal |author=Tamburrini G, Caldarelli M, Massimi L, Santini P, Di Rocco C |title=Intracranial pressure monitoring in children with single suture and complex craniosynostosis: a review |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=913–21 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=15871027 |doi=10.1007/s00381-004-1117-x }}</ref><ref name="Bristol">{{cite journal |author=Bristol RE, Lekovic GP, Rekate HL |title=The effects of craniosynostosis on the brain with respect to intracranial pressure |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=262–7 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15828710 }}</ref> An elevation of ICP can be present in 4 to 20% of the children where only a single suture is affected.<ref name="Tamburrini"/><ref name="Bristol"/> The incidence of ICP in children with more than one suture involved can be as high as 62%.<ref name="Renier">{{cite journal |author=Renier D, Lajeunie E, Arnaud E, Marchac D |title=Management of craniosynostoses |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=16 |issue=10-11 |pages=645–58 |year=2000 |month=November |pmid=11151714 |url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00381/bibs/0016010/00160645.htm}}</ref> However, even though the children are affected, symptoms are not always present.

====Physical examination====
[[Fundoscopy]] should always be performed in children with craniosynostosis.<ref name="Papilledema">{{cite journal |author=Bannink N, Joosten KF, van Veelen ML, ''et al.'' |title=Papilledema in patients with Apert, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndrome: prevalence, efficacy of treatment, and risk factors |journal=J Craniofac Surg |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=121–7 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18216676 |doi=10.1097/SCS.0b013e31815f4015 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1049-2275&volume=19&issue=1&spage=121}}</ref> It is used to find [[papilledema]] which is sometimes the only symptom of elevated intracranial pressure shown in these children.<ref name="Papilledema"/>

Other parts of the physical examination include the measurement of the head circumference, the assessment of the skull deformity and the search for deformities affecting other parts of the body.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> The head circumference and the growth curve of the head provide important clues into making a differentiation between craniosynostosis, primary microcephaly and [[hydrocephalus]].<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> This differentiation has an important influence on the further treatment of the child.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/>

In a recent article Cunningham et al.<ref name="cunningham"/> described several steps in which a pediatrician should observe the patient to assess skull deformity:

* The first is looking with a bird’s eye view at the patient while the patient preferably faces the parent while sitting on the parents lap. The goal is to assess the shape of the forehead, the skull length, the width of the skull, position of the ears and the symmetry of the frontal bones and [occiput].
* The second is looking at the patient from behind while preferably the child is in the same position as described above. It is important to look at the skull base (to determine whether it is level or not), the position of the ears and to the mastoid (to spot the possible presence of a bulge).
* The third point of view is the frontal view. The points to look at are: eye position, eye symmetry and twisting of the nasal tip.

The implications of the deformities that are seen are extensively discussed under ‘phenotype’. 

Syndromal craniosynostosis presents with a skull deformity as well as deformities affecting other parts of the body.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> Clinical examination should in any case include evaluation of the neck, spine, digits and toes.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>

====Radiographic analysis====
Radiographic analysis by performing a computed axial tomographic scan is the gold standard for diagnosing craniosynostosis.<ref name="Cerovac">{{cite journal |author=Cerovac S, Neil-Dwyer JG, Rich P, Jones BM, Hayward RD |title=Are routine preoperative CT scans necessary in the management of single suture craniosynostosis? |journal=Br J Neurosurg |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=348–54 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12389887 }}</ref><ref name="Goldstein">{{cite journal |author=Goldstein SJ, Kidd RC |title=Value of computed tomography in the evaluation of craniosynostosis |journal=Comput Radiol |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=331–6 |year=1982 |pmid=7166030 }}</ref>

Plain radiography of the skull may be sufficient for diagnosing a single suture craniosynostosis and should therefore be performed,<ref name="Cerovac"/><ref name="Goldstein"/> but the diagnostic value is outweighed by that of the [[CT-scan]].<ref name="Aviv">{{cite journal |author=Aviv RI, Rodger E, Hall CM |title=Craniosynostosis |journal=Clin Radiol |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=93–102 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11977940 |doi=10.1053/crad.2001.0836 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0009926001908360}}</ref> Not only can the sutures be identified more accurately, thus objectively demonstrating a fused suture, but also evaluation of the brain for structural abnormalities and excluding other causes of asymmetric growth are possible at the same time.<ref name="Aviv"/> In addition to this, CT-scanning can visualize the extent of skull deformity, thereby enabling the surgeon to start planning surgical reconstruction.<ref name="Ghali">{{cite journal |author=Ghali GE, Sinn DP, Tantipasawasin S |title=Management of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis |journal=Atlas Oral Maxillofac Surg Clin North Am |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–41 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=12087862 }}</ref>

==Differential Diagnosis==

===Deformational Plagiocephaly===

The main difference between plagiocephaly based on craniosynostosis and deformational plagiocephaly is that there is no suture fusion in the latter one.<ref name="cunningham"/> The malleability of the neonatal skull allows the skull to change shape due to extrinsic forces.<ref name="cunningham"/> 

With the tests a pediatrician should perform, as explained above, the difference is quite easy to make.<ref name="cunningham"/> 
In deformational plagiocephaly the skull does not show a bulging of the mastoid and in these patients the skull base and position of the ears is level, all in contrary with plagiocephaly due to craniosynostosis.<ref name="cunningham"/> Displacement of one ear to the front is characteristic for deformational plagiocephaly.<ref name="cunningham"/>

===Primary microcephaly===
Primary microcephaly shows a clinical image of craniosynostosis, but due to a different cause. The primary failure is the absence of growth of the brain, rendering the sutures of the cranial vault useless.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> As a consequence, the sutures close, presenting a pansynostosis like image.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/>
A differentiation between these two conditions can be made with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The [[subarachnoid]] spaces are typically enlarged with primary microcephaly, whereas they are reduced or absent in true pansynostosis.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/>

==Presenting symptoms==

Not all cranial abnormalities seen in children with craniosynostosis are solely a consequence of the premature fusion of a cranial suture. This is especially true in the cases with syndromic craniosynostosis. Findings include elevation of the intracranial pressure; [[obstructive sleep apnoea]](OSA); abnormalities in the skull base and neurobehavioral impairment.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

===Elevated intracranial pressure===

When the ICP is elevated the following symptomes may occur: vomiting, visual disturbance, bulging of the anterior fontanel, altered mental status, [[papilledema]] and headache.<ref name="jong">{{cite journal |author=de Jong T, Bannink N, Bredero-Boelhouwer HH, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term functional outcome in 167 patients with syndromic craniosynostosis; defining a syndrome-specific risk profile |journal=J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=1635–41 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=19913472 |doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2009.10.029 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1748-6815(09)00754-2}}</ref>

The main risks of prolonged elevated intracranial pressure may include cognitive impairment and impaired vision through prolonged papilledema.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> These are the main reasons why fundoscopy should be performed during the physical examination of children with craniosynostosis.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/>

The causes of an elevation of the intracranial pressure are best understood using the [[Monro-Kellie doctrine]].<ref name="Mokri">{{cite journal |author=Mokri B |title=The Monro-Kellie hypothesis: applications in CSF volume depletion |journal=Neurology |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=1746–8 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11425944 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11425944}}</ref> The Monro-Kellie doctrine reduces the cranial vault to a box with rigid walls.<ref name="Mokri"/> This box contains three elements: brain, intracranial blood and cerebrospinal fluid.<ref name="Mokri"/> The sum of volumes of these three elements is constant.<ref name="Mokri"/> An increase in one should cause a decrease in one or both of the remaining two, thereby preventing an elevation of the intracranial pressure.<ref name="Mokri"/>
A compensatory mechanism involves the movement of cerebrospinal fluid from the cranial vault towards the spinal cord.<ref name="Mokri"/> The volume of blood in the cranial vault is auto-regulated by the brain, and will therefore not decrease that easily.<ref name="Mokri"/>

Intracranial pressure will rise as a result of continued brain growth within the rigid skull.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> It appears that in children with craniosynostosis, the expected decrease of intracranial blood is probably not occurring as it should according to the Monro-Kellie hypothesis.<ref name="Tamburrini"/> This is shown when the brain expands in the fixed skull, which gives a faster rise in intracranial pressure than would be expected.<ref name="Tamburrini"/>

===Obstructive sleep apnea===

The short stops in breathing during the sleep are the mainstay of OSA. Other symptoms can be difficulty in breathing, snoring, day-time sleepiness and perspiration.<ref name="Bannink"/>
The main causative agent of OSA is the [midface hypoplasia], which also poses a risk to the eyes that can be seen bulging out of the eye sockets. Other factors, such as a [[micrognathism]] and [[adenoid hypertrophy]], are likely to contribute in causing OSA.<ref name="Bannink"/>
The most common syndromic forms of craniosynostosis; i.e. Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer, have an increased risk of developing OSA. The children have nearly 50% chance of developing this condition.<ref name="Bannink"/>

A theory regarding the involvement of OSA as a causative agent for elevated intracranial pressure suggests an association with the auto-regulation of blood flow in the brain.<ref name="Bristol"/>
Certain cells in the brain respond specifically to an increase of CO2 in the blood.<ref name="Intracranial pressure"/><ref name="Eide">{{cite journal |author=Eide PK |title=Assessment of quality of continuous intracranial pressure recordings in children |journal=Pediatr Neurosurg |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=28–34 |year=2006 |pmid=16357498 |doi=10.1159/000089506 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=10.1159/000089506}}</ref> The response involves vasodilatation of the cranial vault blood vessels, increasing the volume of one of the elements in the Monro-Kellie doctrine.<ref name="Intracranial pressure"/><ref name="Eide"/> The increase of CO2 concentration in the blood is a consequence of impaired breathing, especially seen when the child suffering from OSA is sleeping.<ref name="Intracranial pressure"/><ref name="Eide"/> It is well documented that the highest spikes in intracranial pressure often occur during sleep.<ref name="Intracranial pressure"/><ref name="Eide"/>

===Abnormalities in the skull base===
Impaired venous outflow is often caused by a hypoplastic [[jugular foramen]].<ref name="Bristol"/> This causes an increase in the intracranial blood volume, thereby causing an increase in intracranial pressure.<ref name="Bristol"/>

This can be further complicated with a possible [[Arnold-Chiari malformation]], which can partially obstruct the flow of liquor from the neurocranium to the spinal cord.<ref name="genetics"/> The Chiari malformation may be asymptomatic or present with [[ataxia]], [[spasticity]] or abnormalities in breathing, swallowing or sleeping.<ref name="genetics"/>

Due to the impaired venous outflow, which may be further complicated with an Arnold-Chiari malformation, there is often a clinical image of [[hydrocephalus]] present. Hydrocephalus is seen in 6.5 to 8% of patients with Apert’s syndrome, 25.6% in patients with Crouzon’s syndrome and 27.8% of those with Pfeifer’s syndrome.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite book |author=Cohen MM Jr, et al. |title=Craniosynostosis: Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Management |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages=316–353 |edition=2nd}}</ref>
[[Ventriculomegaly]] is a usual finding in children with the Apert syndrome.<ref name="Collmann">{{cite journal |author=Collmann H, Sörensen N, Krauss J |title=Hydrocephalus in craniosynostosis: a review |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=902–12 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=15864600 |doi=10.1007/s00381-004-1116-y }}</ref>

===Neurobehavioural impairment===
Neurobehavioural impairment includes problems with attention and planning, processing speed, visual spatial skills, language, reading and spelling.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/> A decreased IQ may also be part of the problems.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/>

It has been suggested that these problems are caused by a primary malformation of the brain, rather than being a consequence of the growth restriction of the skull and elevated intracranial pressure. Some evidence for this statement has been provided by studies using computed tomographic ([[CT scans]]) and magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]) to identify differences between the structures of the brains of healthy children and those affected with craniosynostosis.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/>
It has been found that corrective surgery of the [[cranial vault]] alters the morphology of the brain compared with the situation before surgical intervention.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/> However the structure was still abnormal in comparison to children without craniosynostosis.<ref name="Neurodevelopment"/>

==Treatment==

===Goal of surgery===

The primary goal in surgical intervention is to allow normal cranial vault development to occur.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> This can be achieved by excision of the prematurely fused suture and correction of the associated skull deformities.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> If the synostosis goes uncorrected, the deformity will progressively worsen not only threatening the aesthetic aspect, but also the functional aspect.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> This is especially the case in the asymmetric conditions, such as unilateral coronal synostosis, with compromised function of the eyes and the jaw.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>
In addition signs of compromised neurodevelopment have been seen amongst all the synostoses, although this may also be caused by primary maldevelopment of the brain and can thus not be prevented by surgical intervention.<ref name="Spetlz">{{cite journal |author=Speltz ML, Kapp-Simon KA, Cunningham M, Marsh J, Dawson G |title=Single-suture craniosynostosis: a review of neurobehavioral research and theory |journal=J Pediatr Psychol |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=651–68 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15491988 |doi=10.1093/jpepsy/jsh068 |url=http://jpepsy.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15491988}}</ref>

===Timing of surgery===

The prevention of the complications mentioned above plays an important role in the discussion about the timing of the surgery. The general consensus is now to perform surgery in early infancy, i.e. between six to twelve months.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> In this time frame the efficacy of surgery is enhanced due to several reasons: 
* The bone is still more malleable and can be remodelled relatively ‘simply’ by [[greenstick fracture]]s of the bone.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> At approximately one year of age the bone has become more mineralized and brittle and needs to be fastened to the surrounding bone with sutures or an absorbable plate.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>
* Reshaping of the cranial vault most commonly means excision of the bones and adjustment of the shape.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> Replacement of the bones can leave ‘gaps’ which are readily re-ossified before the age of one year, but need bony filling thereafter.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>

The reason why most surgeons will not intervene until after the age of six months is the greater risk that blood loss poses before this age.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> If possible it is preferred to wait until after three months of age when the anaesthetic risks are decreased.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>

Surgery is not performed in early childhood in every country. In some countries surgical intervention can take place in the late teens.

It is important that families seek out a Pediatric Craniofacial Physician who has experience with craniosynostosis for proper diagnosis, surgical care, and followup.

===Basic elements of surgery===

There are a few basic elements involved in the surgical intervention aimed at normalization of the [[cranial vault]].

* One is minimization of blood loss, which is attempted by injection of vasoconstrictive agents (i.e. [[epinephrine]]) seven to ten minutes before scalp incision.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> In addition is the initiation of surgery delayed until [[blood products]] are physically present in the operating room.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>

* Another general agreement is the avoidance of the use of titanium plates in the fixation of the skull.<ref name="Fearon">{{cite journal |author=Fearon JA, Munro IR, Bruce DA |title=Observations on the use of rigid fixation for craniofacial deformities in infants and young children |journal=Plast.

===Surgical intervention per particular fused suture===

====Sagittal craniosynostosis/scaphocephaly====
There are two surgical procedures which are commonly used to treat sagittal synostosis.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> Which of the two is the best is still heavily debated amongst the surgeons treating this condition.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> It is generally agreed upon that the [[cephalic index]] should be used to assess the efficacy of the surgical intervention.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>

* Firstly, the extended strip craniectomy will be discussed, which is a further developed form of the traditional [[craniectomy]].<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> The traditional procedure involved only the excision of the closed suture, hoping that the compensatory skull deformations would automatically be corrected by the fast growth of the brain during the first year of life.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/><br />This did not quite result in a true normalization of the cranial vault, causing the development of numerous modifications.<ref name="Jimenez">{{cite journal |author=Jimenez DF, Barone CM |title=Endoscopic craniectomy for early surgical correction of sagittal craniosynostosis |journal=J.

This procedure can be performed by using an [[endoscope]] and became more popular due to rapid recovery of the child and the reduced need for [[blood transfusion]].<ref name="Jimenez"/><ref name="Baronez"/> The patient is afterwards placed in a custom made molding helmet to correct the resting deformities of the skull.<ref name="Jimenez"/><ref name="Baronez"/>

* With the total cranial vault remodelling, which is the other widely used surgical procedure, the compensatory deformities are corrected during the operation, in addition to excision of the fused suture.<ref name="Francel">{{cite book |chapter=Evolution of the treatment for sagittal synostosis: a personal record |editor=Francel P. |title=Craniofacial Anomalies: Growth and Development from a Surgical Perspective |publisher=Thieme |location=New York |year=1995 }}</ref> Most of the bones that together form the cranial vault – i.e. the frontal, the parietal and the occipital bones – are removed and reshaped to normalize the contours.<ref name="Francel"/> The bones are then replaced and fixated to form a cranial vault with a normalized shape.<ref name="Francel"/>

Retrospective analysis has given indication that the use of total cranial vault remodelling provides the children with a better cephalic index than does the extended strip craniectomy.<ref name="Panchal J">{{cite journal |author=Panchal J, Marsh JL, Park TS, Kaufman B, Pilgram T, Huang SH |title=Sagittal craniosynostosis outcome assessment for two methods and timings of intervention |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=1574–84 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10323690 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=103&issue=6&spage=1574}}</ref>

An approach that is currently evaluated is the use of springs. This intervention is likely most effective when used in the time frame between three to six months.

====Metopic synostosis/trigonocephaly====

The main elements of metopic suture closure are a low volume of the [[anterior cranial fossa]], the metopic ridging and [[hypotelorism]].<ref name="Metopic synostosis">{{cite book |chapter=Metopic synostosis |editor=Francel P, et al. |title=Neurosurgical Operative Atlas |publisher=American Association of Neurological Surgeons |location=Rolling Meadows IL |year=1999 |pages=91–111 |volume=9}}</ref> These problems are all addressed during the surgical intervention.<ref name="Metopic synostosis"/>

The volume is increased by placing the frontal bones and the supraorbital rim further forwards.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> This is done by excision of the bones after which they are reshaped with [[greenstick fracture|greenstick fracturing]].<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>  Replacement of the bones provides a possibility for the correction of the hypotelorism at the same time.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>  A bone graft is placed in between the two halves of the supraorbital bars, thereby increasing the width between the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]].<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> The metopic ridge can be corrected with a (simple) burring.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

====Unilateral coronal synostosis/anterior plagiocephaly====
The treatment of unilateral coronal synostosis typically exists out of two parts: the forward advancement of the supraorbital bar and the correction of the orbital asymmetry.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>

The supraorbital bar is the rim just above the eye socket. As discussed under phenotype, the supraorbital and the frontal bone are typically recessed at the [[ipsilateral]] side of the head.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> The goal is to position this bar together with the frontal bone in a plane three millimetres further forwards than the vertical plane of the [[cornea]].<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>
A two-dimensional [[sagittal]] image is used to pre-operatively determine the extent of movement, which can vary between seven to fifteen millimetres, depending on the severity of the deformity.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>

The orbital asymmetry exists typically of a narrower and taller orbit at the ipsilateral side of the head.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> The [[contralateral]] orbit, however, is wider than usual.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> The symmetry is restored by extracting a small piece of bone from the supraorbital bar at the contralateral side, thereby reducing the width.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> This bone fragment is introduced into the supraorbital bar on the ipsilateral side, thereby increasing the width.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/> The height of the orbit is just altered at the ipsilateral side, by extracting a piece of bone.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/>
The correction of the nasal tip, which points towards the contralateral side, is not performed during childhood.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

====Unilateral lambdoid synostosis/posterior plagiocephaly====

An excision of the flattened occipital bone with release of the fused suture tends to correct the cranial vault deformity.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

====Bilateral coronal synostosis/brachycephaly====

The treatment of bilateral coronal synostosis shows great overlap with the treatment of unilateral coronal synostosis; in both surgical interventions is the forward advancement of the supraorbital rim together with the frontal bones an important part of the procedure.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> Again is the plane three millimetres further forwards than the vertical plane of the [cornea] the appropriate position to place the bone.<ref name="Management of craniosynostosis"/><ref name="Persing et al"/> The increased height of the skull is addressed in the same procedure.<ref name="Persing et al"/> Parts of the flattened [[occiput]] are extracted and given a rounder shape by greenstick fracturing them.<ref name="Persing et al"/>

====Pansynostosis/kleeblattschädel====
The treatment of pansynostosis comprises the expansion of the [[anterior]] [[cranial vault]], as well as the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] cranial vault.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/> This can be accomplished in one procedure, but is generally performed in two.<ref name="Pansynostosis"/>
