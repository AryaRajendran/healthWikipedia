'''Cornelia de Lange Syndrome''' ('''CdLS''') is a genetic disorder present from birth, but not always diagnosed at birth. It causes a range of physical, cognitive and medical challenges and affects both genders equally. CdLS does not discriminate—it’s seen in all races and ethnic backgrounds. The occurrence of CdLS is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 live births.

It is often termed as '''Bushy Syndrome''' and is also known as '''Amsterdam dwarfism'''. It is a [[genetic disorder]] that can lead to severe developmental anomalies. It affects the physical and intellectual development of a child. Exact incidence is unknown, but it is estimated at 1 in 10,000 to 30,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=corneliadelangesyndrome |title=Bushy Syndrome- Genetics Home Reference |accessdate=2007-08-24 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Causes==

The vast majority of cases are due to spontaneous genetic mutations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

It can be associated with mutations affecting the [[cohesin]] complex.<ref name="pmid19793304">{{cite journal |author=Liu J, Krantz ID |title=Bushy Syndrome, cohesin, and beyond |journal=Clin. Genet. |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=303–14 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19793304 |pmc=2853897 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2009.01271.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0009-9163&date=2009&volume=76&issue=4&spage=303}}</ref>

Multiple genes have been associated with the condition. In 2004, researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne (England), identified a gene (NIPBL) on chromosome 5 that causes CdLS when it is mutated. Since then, additional genes have been found (SMC1A, SMC3 and HDAC8) that cause CdLS when changed. There are likely other genes as well. Researchers hope to gain a better understanding of why CdLS varies so widely from one individual to another and what can be done to improve the quality of life for people with the syndrome.

The latter two genes seem to correlate with a milder form of the syndrome.

In July 2012, the fourth “CdLS gene”—HDAC8—was announced. Many parents and professionals have 
questions about this latest finding and what it means. HDAC8 is an X-linked gene, meaning it is located on the X chromosome. The X and Y chromosomes are the sex chromosomes that determine whether an individual will be a boy or girl. Typically, a female has two Xs (XX) and a male has an X and Y (XY). Individuals with CdLS who have the gene change in HDAC8 make up just a small portion of all people with CdLS.<ref name="CdLS Foundation - HDAC8 FAQ Sheet">{{cite web|title=HDAC8 FAQ Sheet|url=http://www.cdlsusa.org/docs/HDAC8-FAQ-Sheet.pdf|work=CdLS Foundation Web site|publisher=Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The first ever documented case was in 1916 by [[Winfried Robert Clemens Brachmann]]<ref>Brachmann, W. Ein Fall von symmetrischer Monodaktylie durch Ulnadefekt, mit symmetrischer Flughautbildung in den Ellenbeugen, sowie anderen Abnormitaeten (Zwerghaftigkeit, Halsrippen, Behaarung) (A case of symmetrical monodactyly, representing ulnar deficiency, with symmetrical antecubital webbing and other abnormalities, (dwarfism, cervical ribs, hirsutism)). ''Jahrbuch fuer Kinderheilkunde und physische Erziehung'' 84: 225-235, 1916.</ref> followed up by '''[[Cornelia Catharina de Lange]]''',<ref>de Lange, C. Sur un type nouveau de degenerescence (typus Amstelodamensis). ''Arch. Med. Enfants'' 36: 713-719, 1933.</ref> a Dutch pediatrician, in 1933 after whom the disorder has been named.<ref>http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/1080.html</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of CdLS is primarily a clinical one based on signs and symptoms (see below) observed through an evaluation by a physician, including a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Since 2006, testing for NIPBL and SMC1A has been available through the University of Chicago.[http://www.genes.uchicago.edu/] This is best accomplished through a referral to a genetics specialist or clinic.

CdLS is thought to be underdiagnosed and frequently misdiagnosed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Genetic testing for CdLS is offered through the following facilities:

(Research Lab currently providing testing to individuals whose previous blood test(s) didn't show changes in NIPBL or SMC1A, and for families with multiple cases of CdLS)

==Features and characteristics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
Following are the features and characteristics that help in spotting this disorder: <ref name="Characteristics of CdLS">{{cite web|title=CdLS Foundation - Characteristics of CdLS|url=http://www.cdlsusa.org/what-is-cdls/characteristics-of-cdls.htm|publisher=Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> 
* [[Low birth weight]] (usually under 5 pounds/2.5 kilograms)
* Delayed growth and small stature
* [[Developmental delay]]
* Limb differences (missing limbs or portions of limbs)
* Small head size ([[microcephaly]])
* Thick eyebrows, which typically meet at midline ([[synophrys]])
* Long [[eyelash]]es
* Short upturned nose and thin downturned lips
* Long [[philtrum]]
* Excessive body hair
* Small hands and feet
* Small widely spaced teeth
* Low-set ears
* Hearing impairments
* Vision abnormalities (e.g., [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], high [[myopia]], [[hypertropia]])
* Partial joining of the second and third toes
* Incurved 5th fingers
* [[Gastroesophageal reflux]]
* [[Seizures]]
* [[Heart]] defects
* [[Cleft palate]]
* Feeding problems
* Hypoplastic genitalia

Children with this syndrome are often found to have long eyelashes, bushy eyebrows and [[synophrys]] (joined eyebrows). Body hair can be excessive and affected individuals are often shorter than their immediate family members.

CdLS can give rise to its own array of complexities. Children with CdLS often suffer from [[gastrointestinal tract]] difficulties, particularly gastroesophageal reflux. Vomiting, intermittent poor appetite, [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]] or gaseous distention are known to be a regularity in cases where the GE tract problems are acute. Symptoms may range from mild to severe.

CdLS may include behavior problems, including self-stimulation, aggression, self-injury or strong preference to a structured routine. Many children with CdLS exhibit autistic-like behaviors.

Behavior problems in CdLS are not inevitable. Many behavior issues associated with CdLS are reactive (i.e., something happens within the person's body or environment to bring on the behavior) and cyclical (comes and goes). Often, an underlying medical issue causes a change in behavior. Once the medical issue is treated, the behavior diminishes.

==Treatment==
<ref name="CdLS Foundation">{{cite news|title=CdLS Foundation - Treatment Protocols|url=http://www.cdlsusa.org/what-is-cdls/treatment-protocols.htm|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=12 February 2013}}</ref> 
Often, an interdisciplinary approach to therapy and treatment of any medical issues that arise is recommended. A team for promotion of the child's well-being often includes speech, occupational and physical therapists, teachers, physicians and, most importantly, the parent(s).
