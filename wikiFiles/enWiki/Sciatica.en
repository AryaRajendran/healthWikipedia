Retrieved December 3, 2012 fromhttp://www.njpcc.com/conditions-of-the-spine/lumbar-radiculopathy-sciatica.html</ref><ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000095050|sciatica}}</ref> is a set of symptoms including [[pain]] that may be caused by general compression or irritation of one of five spinal nerve roots that give rise to each [[sciatic nerve]], or by compression or irritation of the left or right or both sciatic nerves. Symptoms include [[lower back pain]], buttock pain, and pain, numbness or weakness in various parts of the leg and foot. Other symptoms include pins and needles or tingling and difficulty in moving or controlling the leg. Typically, the symptoms are only felt on one side of the body, the pain may radiate below the knee but not always. 

Although sciatica is a relatively common form of low back and leg pain, the true meaning of the term is often misunderstood. Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a diagnosis for what is irritating the root of the nerve, causing the pain. The treatment for sciatica or sciatic symptoms often differs, depending upon the underlying cause and pain levels. Causes include compression of the sciatic nerve roots caused by a herniated (torn) or protruding disc in the lower back.

The first known use of the word ''sciatica'' dates to 1451.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Ed. "a1450a Mankind (Brandl)."</ref>

==Definition==
The term sciatica is used to describe a symptom rather than a specific disease.<!-- <ref name=Valat2010/> --> Some use it to mean any pain starting in the lower back and going down the leg.<!-- <ref name=Valat2010/> --> Others use the term more specifically to mean a nerve dysfunction caused by compression of one or more lumbar or sacral nerve roots from a spinal disc herniation.<!-- <ref name=Valat2010/> --> The pain typically occurs in the distribution of a [[Dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]] and goes below the knee to the foot.<!-- <ref name=Valat2010/> --> It may be associated with neurological dysfunction such as weakness.<ref name=Valat2010/>

==Cause==
===Spinal disc herniation===
{{main|Spinal disc herniation}}
[[Spinal disc herniation]] pressing on one of the [[lumbar nerve|lumbar]] or [[sacral nerve]] roots is the primary cause of sciatica, being present in about 90% of cases.<ref name=Valat2010/>

Sciatica caused by pressure from a disc herniation and swelling of surrounding tissue can spontaneously subside if the tear in the disc heals and the pulposus extrusion and inflammation cease.

===Spinal stenosis===
{{main|Lumbar spinal stenosis}}
Other compressive spinal causes include [[lumbar spinal stenosis]], a condition in which the spinal canal (the spaces through which the spinal cord runs) narrows and compresses the spinal cord, [[cauda equina]], or sciatic nerve roots. This narrowing can be caused by bone spurs, [[spondylolisthesis]], inflammation, or [[herniated disc]], which decreases available space for the spinal cord, thus pinching and irritating nerves from the spinal cord that travel to the sciatic nerves.

===Piriformis syndrome===
[[Piriformis syndrome]] is a controversial condition which depending on the analysis varies from a "very rare" cause to contributing to up to 8% of low back or buttock pain.<ref name=Miller2012>{{cite journal |author=Miller TA, White KP, Ross DC |title=The diagnosis and management of Piriformis Syndrome: myths and facts |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=577–83 |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22931697 |doi= |url=}}</ref> In 15% of the population, the sciatic nerve runs through, or under the [[piriformis muscle]] rather than beneath it. When the muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it's posited that this causes compression of the sciatic nerve.<ref name=Miller2012/> It has colloquially been referred to as "wallet sciatica" since a [[wallets|wallet]] carried in a rear hip pocket will compress the muscles of the buttocks and sciatic nerve when the bearer sits down.  Piriformis syndrome may be a cause of sciatica when the nerve root is normal.<ref name="pmid19466717">{{cite journal |pages= 10–18 |doi=10.1002/mus.21318 |title= Piriformis syndrome, diagnosis and treatment |year= 2009 |last1= Kirschner |first1= Jonathan S. |last2= Foye |first2= Patrick M. |last3= Cole |first3= Jeffrey L. |journal= Muscle & Nerve |volume= 40 |pmid=19466717 |issue= 1}}</ref><ref name="pmid17030664">{{cite journal |pages=1469–1472 |doi=10.1001/archneur.63.10.1469 |title=Magnetic Resonance Neurography in Extraspinal Sciatica |year=2006 |last1=Lewis |first1=A.

===Pregnancy===
Sciatica may also occur during pregnancy as a result of the weight of the [[fetus]] pressing on the sciatic nerve during sitting or during leg spasms. While most cases do not directly harm the fetus or the mother, indirect harm may come from the numbing effect on the legs which can cause loss of balance and falling. There is no standard treatment for pregnancy induced sciatica.<ref>[http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/sciaticnervepain.html Sciatic nerve compression during pregnancy]</ref>

===Other===
Sciatica can also be caused by tumours impinging on the spinal cord or the nerve roots.<ref name=Valat2010/> Severe back pain extending to the hips and feet, loss of bladder or bowel control, or muscle weakness, may result from spinal tumours or [[cauda equina syndrome]]. Trauma to the spine, such as from a car accident, may also lead to sciatica.

==Pathophysiology==

Sciatica is generally caused by the compression of [[lumbar nerves]] L3, L4 or L5 or [[sacral nerves]] S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the [[sciatic nerve]] itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a [[dorsal root|dorsal nerve root]] ([[Radix (disambiguation)|radix]]) it is considered a lumbar [[radiculopathy]] (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur as a result of a spinal disk bulge or [[spinal disc herniation]] (a herniated [[intervertebral disc]]), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (''[[spondylolisthesis]]'') of the [[vertebra]]e, or as a result of [[degenerative disc disease|degenerated discs]] that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the [[Annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|annulus fibrosus]], the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, [[cauda equina]], or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness or excruciating pain. Inflammation in the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent [[Zygapophysial joint|facet joints]] and cause lower back pain and/or [[referred pain]] in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the [[piriformis]] or related [[muscle]]s.

The spinal discs are composed of a tough spongiform ring of cartilage ("[[Annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|annulus fibrosus]]") with a more malleable center ("[[nucleus pulposus]]"). The discs separate the vertebrae, thereby allowing room for the nerve roots to properly exit through the spaces between the vertebrae. The discs cushion the spine from compressive forces, but are weak to pressure applied during rotational movements. That is why a person who bends to one side, at a bad angle to pick something up, may more likely herniate a spinal disc than a person jumping from a ladder and landing on his or her feet.

Herniation of a disc occurs when the liquid center of the disc bulges outwards, tearing the external ring of fibers, extrudes into the spinal canal, and compresses a nerve root against the lamina or pedicle of a vertebra, thus causing sciatica.  This extruded liquid from the "[[nucleus pulposus]]" may cause inflammation and swelling of surrounding tissue, which may cause further compression of the nerve root in the confined space in the spinal canal.

== Diagnosis==
Sciatica is typically diagnosed by physical examination, and the history of the symptoms.<ref name=Valat2010>{{cite journal|last=Valat|first=JP|coauthors=Genevay, S; Marty, M; Rozenberg, S; Koes, B|title=Sciatica.|journal=Best practice & research. Clinical rheumatology|date=2010 Apr|volume=24|issue=2|pages=241-52|pmid=20227645|doi=10.1016/j.berh.2009.11.005}}</ref> Generally if a person reports the typical radiating pain in one leg as well as one or more neurological indications of nerve root tension or neurological deficit, sciatica can be diagnosed.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1313–1317 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39223.428495.BE |title=Diagnosis and treatment of sciatica |year=2007 |last1=Koes |first1=B W |last2=Van Tulder |first2=M W |last3=Peul |first3=W C |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7607 |pmid=17585160 |pmc=1895638}}</ref>

The most applied diagnostic test is the straight leg raise to produce [[Lasègue's sign]], which is considered positive if pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve is reproduced with between 30 and 70 degrees passive flexion of the straight leg.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Speed|first=C|title=Low back pain.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2004 May 8|volume=328|issue=7448|pages=1119-21|pmid=15130982|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1119|pmc=406328}}</ref> While this test is positive in about 90% of people with sciatica, approximately 75% of people with a positive test do not have sciatica.<ref name=Valat2010/>

Imaging tests such as [[computerised tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] can help with the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation.<ref name="Gregory et al.">{{cite journal |pmid=18841731 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=18841731 |year=2008 |last1=Gregory |first1=DS |last2=Seto |first2=CK |last3=Wortley |first3=GC |last4=Shugart |first4=CM |title=Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices |volume=78 |issue=7 |pages=835–42 |journal=American family physician}}</ref> The utility of [[Magnetic resonance neurography|MR neurography]] in the diagnoses of piriformis syndrome is controversial.<ref name=Miller2012/>

==Management==
When the cause of sciatica is due to a [[Spinal disc herniation|lumbar disc herniation]], most cases resolve spontaneously over weeks to months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Casey|first=E|title=Natural history of radiculopathy.|journal=Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America|date=2011 Feb|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1-5|pmid=21292142|doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2010.10.001}}</ref> Initially treatment in the first 6-8&nbsp;weeks should be conservative.<ref name=Valat2010/> There does not appear to be a significant difference in outcomes between advice to stay active and recommendations of bed rest.<ref name=Hagen2004>{{cite journal|last=Hagen|first=KB|coauthors=Hilde, G; Jamtvedt, G; Winnem, M|title=Bed rest for acute low-back pain and sciatica.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2004 Oct 18|issue=4|pages=CD001254|pmid=15495012|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001254.pub2}}</ref> Similarly, physical therapy (exercises) has not been found better than bed rest.<ref name="Luijsterburg1">{{cite journal |pages=881–899 |doi=10.1007/s00586-007-0367-1 |title=Effectiveness of conservative treatments for the lumbosacral radicular syndrome: a systematic review |year=2007 |last1=Luijsterburg|first1=Pim A.

===Medication===
Although medications are commonly prescribed for the treatment of sciatica, evidence for [[analgesics]] is poor.<ref name=Pinto2012>{{cite journal|last=Pinto|first=RZ|coauthors=Maher, CG; Ferreira, ML; Ferreira, PH; Hancock, M; Oliveira, VC; McLachlan, AJ; Koes, B|title=Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2012 Feb 13|volume=344|pages=e497|pmid=22331277|pmc=3278391}}</ref> Specifically [[NSAIDs]] do not appear to improve immediate pain and all NSAIDs appear about equivalent.<ref name=Pinto2012/> Evidence is also lacking in use of [[opioid]]s and muscle relaxants. In those with sciatica, believed to be due to piriformis syndrome, botulism toxin injections may improve pain, and or function.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waseem|first=Z|coauthors=Boulias, C; Gordon, A; Ismail, F; Sheean, G; Furlan, AD|title=Botulinum toxin injections for low-back pain and sciatica.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2011 Jan 19|issue=1|pages=CD008257|pmid=21249702|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008257.pub2}}</ref>

===Surgery===
Surgery for unilateral sciatica involves the removal of part of the disc, known as a [[discectomy]]. While it results in short term benefits, long term benefits appear equivalent to conservative care.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bruggeman|first=AJ|coauthors=Decker, RC|title=Surgical treatment and outcomes of lumbar radiculopathy.|journal=Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America|date=2011 Feb|volume=22|issue=1|pages=161-77|pmid=21292152|doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2010.10.002}}</ref><ref name=Valat2010/> Treatment of the underlying cause of the compression is needed in cases of [[epidural abscess]], epidural tumors, and [[cauda equina syndrome]].

===Epidurals===
Good quality of evidence to suggest short-term pain reduction with epidural steroid injections, long-term benefit is controversial. Other agents, ex: TNF inhibitors, have not shown efficacy in most randomized controlled trials.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

===Alternative medicine===
Moderate quality evidence suggests that [[spinal manipulation]] is an effective treatment for acute sciatica.<ref name=Leininger2011/> For chronic sciatica the evidence is poor.<ref name=Leininger2011>{{cite journal |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2010.11.002 |title=Spinal Manipulation or Mobilization for Radiculopathy: A Systematic Review |year=2011 |last1=Leininger |first1=Brent |last2=Bronfort |first2=Gert |last3=Evans |first3=Roni |last4=Reiter |first4=Todd |journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America |volume=22 |pmid=21292148 |issue=1}}</ref> Spinal manipulation has been found to be generally safe for the treatment of disc-related pain however case reports have found an association with [[cauda equina syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tamburrelli|first=FC|coauthors=Genitiempo, M; Logroscino, CA|title=Cauda equina syndrome and spine manipulation: case report and review of the literature.|journal=European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society|date=2011 May|volume=20 Suppl 1|pages=S128-31|pmid=21404036|doi=10.1007/s00586-011-1745-2|pmc=3087049}}</ref> and it is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] when there are progressive neurological deficits.<ref name=WHO-chiro-guidelines>[http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic.
