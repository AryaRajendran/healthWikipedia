'''Non-small-cell lung carcinoma''' ('''NSCLC''') is any type of epithelial [[lung cancer]] other than [[small-cell lung carcinoma|small cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC). As a class, NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to [[chemotherapy]], compared to small cell carcinoma. When possible, they are primarily treated by surgical resection with curative intent, although chemotherapy is increasingly being used both pre-operatively ([[Neoadjuvant therapy|neoadjuvant chemotherapy]]) and post-operatively ([[Adjuvant therapy|adjuvant chemotherapy]]).

The most common types of NSCLC are [[squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], [[large-cell carcinoma|large cell carcinoma]], and [[adenocarcinoma]], but there are several other types that occur less frequently, and all types can occur in unusual histologic variants and as mixed cell-type combinations.<ref name="nci">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/CANCERTOPICS/PDQ/TREATMENT/NON-SMALL-CELL-LUNG/PATIENT |title=Non-small cell lung cancer treatment - National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref>

Sometimes the phrase "non-small-cell lung cancer" ("not otherwise specified", or NOS) is used generically, usually when a more specific diagnosis cannot be made. This is most often the case when a pathologist examines a small amount of malignant cells or tissue in a [[Cytopathology|cytology]] or [[biopsy]] specimen.<ref name="nci"/>

Lung cancer in never-smokers is almost universally NSCLC, with a sizeable majority being adenocarcinoma.<ref name="Nasser">{{cite web |author=Hanna, Nasser |title=Lung Cancer in the Never Smoker Population |year=2007 |work=Hematology-Oncology |publisher=Medscape |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/566978}}</ref>

On relatively rare occasions, malignant lung tumors are found to contain components of both SCLC and NSCLC. In these cases, the tumors should be classified as [[Combined small-cell lung carcinoma|combined small cell lung carcinoma]] (c-SCLC),<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> and are (usually) treated like "pure" SCLC.<ref name='SimonTurrisi'>{{cite journal |author=Simon GR, Turrisi A |title=Management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=324S–339S |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17873178 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-1385 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17873178}}</ref>

===Squamous cell lung carcinoma===
[[File:Ca bronchus.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of a squamous-cell carcinoma. Tumour is on the left, obstructing the bronchus (lung).
Beyond the tumour, the bronchus is inflamed and contains mucus.]]

[[Squamous-cell carcinoma|Squamous cell carcinoma]] (SCC) of the [[lung]] is more common in [[men]] than in women. It is closely correlated with a history of [[tobacco smoking]], more so than most other types of [[lung cancer]]. According to the [[Nurses' Health Study]], the [[relative risk]] of SCC is approximately 5.5, both among those with a previous duration of smoking of 1 to 20 years, and those with 20 to 30 years, compared to never-smokers.<ref name=Stacey2008>{{cite doi|10.1136/tc.2007.022582}}</ref> The relative risk increases to approximately 16 with a previous smoking duration of 30 to 40 years, and approximately 22 with more than 40 years.<ref name=Stacey2008/>

It most often arises centrally in larger [[Bronchus|bronchi]], and while it often metastasizes to locoregional lymph nodes (particularly the hilar nodes) early in its course, it generally disseminates outside the thorax somewhat later than other major types of lung cancer. Large tumors may undergo central necrosis, resulting in [[cavitation (biology)|cavitation]]. A squamous cell carcinoma is often preceded for years by squamous cell [[metaplasia]] or [[dysplasia]] in the [[respiratory epithelium]] of the bronchi, which later transforms to [[carcinoma in situ]]. In carcinoma in situ, atypical cells may be identified by [[cytologic smear test]] of sputum, [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] or samples from [[endobronchial brushing]]s. However, squamous-cell carcinoma in situ is asymptomatic and undetectable on X-ray radiographs. Eventually, it becomes symptomatic, usually when the tumor mass begins to obstruct the lumen of a major bronchus, often producing distal [[atelectasis]] and [[infection]]. Simultaneously, the lesion invades into the surrounding pulmonary substance. On [[histopathology]], these tumors range from well differentiated, showing keratin pearls and [[cell junction]]s, to [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]], with only minimal residual squamous cell features.<ref name=Kumar-squamous>Entire section, if not else specified, is taken from {{cite book |chapter=Ch. 13, box on morphology of squamous cell carcinoma |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |edition=8th}}</ref>

Currently, four variants (papillary, small cell, clear cell, and basaloid) of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung are recognized. Of these variants, there is some evidence that the basaloid<ref name='WangWang'>{{cite journal |pmid=21269455 |year=2011 |last1=Wang |first1=LC |last2=Wang |first2=L |last3=Kwauk |first3=S |last4=Woo |first4=JA |last5=Wu |first5=LQ |last6=Zhu |first6=H |last7=Zhan |first7=LZ |last8=Sun |first8=NL |last9=Zhang |first9=L |title=Analysis on the clinical features of 22 basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the lung |volume=6 |page=10 |doi=10.1186/1749-8090-6-10 |pmc=3037842 |journal=[[Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery]]}}</ref> and poorly differentiated small-cell variants <ref name="who2004" /> may have worse prognoses than "conventional" squamous cell carcinomas.

Recently, four mRNA expression subtypes (primitive, basal, secretory, and classical) were identified and validated within squamous cell carcinoma. The primitive subtype correlates with worse patient survival.  These subtypes, defined by intrinsic expression differences, provide a possible foundation for improved patient prognosis and research into individualized therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20643781 |year=2010 |last1=Wilkerson |first1=MD |last2=Yin |first2=X |last3=Hoadley |first3=KA |last4=Liu |first4=Y |last5=Hayward |first5=MC |last6=Cabanski |first6=CR |last7=Muldrew |first7=K |last8=Miller |first8=CR |last9=Randell |first9=SH |title=Lung squamous cell carcinoma mRNA expression subtypes are reproducible, clinically important, and correspond to normal cell types |volume=16 |issue=19 |pages=4864–75 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0199 |pmc=2953768 |journal=Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research}}</ref>

===Large-cell lung carcinoma===
{{Main|Large-cell lung carcinoma}}
Large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) is a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated malignant neoplasms originating from transformed epithelial cells in the lung. LCLC's have typically comprised between around 10% of all NSCLC in the past, although newer diagnostic techniques seem to be reducing the incidence of diagnosis of "classic" LCLC in favor of more poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.<ref name='Popper'>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12254-011-0245-8 |title=Large cell carcinoma of the lung – a vanishing entity? |year=2011 |last1=Popper |first1=H. H. |journal=Memo - Magazine of European Medical Oncology |volume=4 |pages=4–9}}</ref> LCLC is, in effect, a "diagnosis of exclusion", in that the tumor cells lack light microscopic characteristics that would classify the neoplasm as a small-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or other more specific histologic type of lung cancer. LCLC is differentiated from [[small-cell lung carcinoma|small cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC) primarily by the larger size of the [[anaplastic]] cells, a higher cytoplasmic-to-nuclear size ratio, and a lack of "salt-and-pepper" chromatin.

===Lung adenocarcinoma===
{{Main|Adenocarcinoma of the lung}}
Adenocarcinoma of the [[lung]] is currently the most common type of [[lung cancer]] in "never smokers" (lifelong non-smokers).<ref>{{cite journal |pages=561–70 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8015 |title=Lung Cancer in Never Smokers: A Review |year=2007 |last1=Subramanian |first1=J. |last2=Govindan |first2=R. |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pmid=17290066}}</ref> Adenocarcinomas account for approximately 40% of lung cancers. Historically, adenocarcinoma was more often seen peripherally in the lungs than [[small-cell lung cancer|small cell lung cancer]] and [[squamous cell]] lung cancer, both of which tended to be more often centrally located.<ref name=Kumar-adenocarcinoma>{{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |chapter=morphology of adenocarcinoma |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |edition=8th}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y |title=Lung cancer |year=1995 |last1=Travis |first1=William D. |last2=Travis |first2=Lois B. |last3=Devesa |first3=Susan S. |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |pmid=8000996 |issue=1 Suppl}}</ref> Interestingly, however, recent studies suggest that the "ratio of centrally-to-peripherally occurring" lesions may be converging toward unity for both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

==Staging==

{{further |Lung cancer staging}}

The [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) and the [[International Union Against Cancer]] (UICC) recommend [[TNM staging system|TNM staging]], using a uniform scheme for non-small cell lung carcinoma, [[small-cell lung carcinoma]] and broncho-pulmonary [[carcinoid]] tumors.<ref name="2010TNM">{{cite book |chapter=Cancer Staging Posters: Lung |chapterurl=http://www.cancerstaging.org/staging/posters/lung8.5x11.pdf |format=PDF |title=AJCC Cancer Staging |edition=7th}}</ref>  AJCC has provided an accessible poster version of these copyrighted TNM descriptors to which readers are directed.<ref name="2010TNM" /> Extensive presentation of prognostic data for both 6th and 7th edition individual TNM descriptors and overall groups is available.<ref>{{cite web |author=De la Guerra, A. |title=New TNM Classification for Lung Cancer.

==Treatment==
{{main|Treatment of lung cancer}}
{{see also|Lung cancer surgery}}
More than one kind of treatment is often used, depending on the stage of the cancer, the individual's overall health, age, response to chemotherapy, and other factors such as the likely side effects of the treatment.

===Early/non-metastatic NSCLC===
NSCLCs are usually ''not'' very sensitive to chemotherapy<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis MO |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |page=759}}</ref> and/or radiation, so surgery is the treatment of choice if diagnosed at an early stage, often with adjuvant (ancillary) [[chemotherapy]] involving [[cisplatin]].  Other treatment choices are [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]] (radiotherapy), and [[targeted therapy]].

New methods of giving radiation treatment allow doctors to be more accurate in treating lung cancers. This means less radiation affects nearby healthy tissues. New methods include [[Cyberknife]] and [[stereotactic]]  [[radiosurgery]] (SRS).

Other treatments are [[radiofrequency ablation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of Lung Tumors |publisher=Cancer News |url=http://www.cancernews.com/data/Article/612.asp}} ]</ref> and [[chemoembolization]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Chemoembolisation |publisher=Cancer Research UK |url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=4910#chemob}}</ref>

===Advanced/metastatic NSCLC===
A wide variety of [[chemotherapy|chemotherapies]] are used in advanced (metastatic) NSCLC.<ref>[http://www.lungcanceronline.org/treatment-nsclc/chemo.html Lung Cancer online]</ref>
Some patients with particular mutations in the ''[[epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]]'' gene respond to EGFR [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]]s such as [[gefitinib]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kris MG |title=How today's developments in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer will change tomorrow's standards of care |journal=Oncologist |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=23–9 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16272456 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.10-90002-23 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16272456}}</ref>

There are many phase III clinical trials of new therapies for advanced NSCLC,<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=advanced+NSCLC&phase=2</ref> including [[intedanib]] (BIBF 1120).

Another phase III study involving NSCLC is the ‘QUARTZ’ study. This is a trial run at The UK Medical Research Council investigating the use of radiotherapy for patients that have also developed inoperable brain metastases.<ref>http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/research_areas/study_details.aspx?s=27</ref>  Although widely used, there is little evidence of its benefits in terms of both overall survival and quality of life. The ‘QUARTZ’ trial aims to assess whether optimal supportive care (OSC) including steroids is as effective as OSC including steroids plus whole brain radiotherapy <ref>http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/radiotherapy/symptoms/radiotherapy-for-brain-cancer-symptoms</ref> in terms of both overall survival and quality of life.

===ALK mutations===
About 7% of NSCLC have EML4-ALK translocations; these may benefit from [[ALK inhibitor]]s which are in clinical trials.<ref name=Farmer2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/treatment-paradigm-shifting-for-nsclc/3423?page=1 |title=Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Standards of Care Challenged by a Cornucopia of New Drugs |author=Farmer |year=2010 }}</ref> [[Crizotinib]] gained FDA approval in August 2011.
