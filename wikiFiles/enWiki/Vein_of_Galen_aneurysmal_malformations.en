==Classification==
Five patterns of Galenic arteriovenous malformations have been described:

:Pattern 1: Many vessels, including anterior cerebral arteries, thalamic perforating arteries, and superior cerebellar arteries discharge into the vein of Galen.<ref name=hoffman>{{cite journal | author = Hoffman HJ | coauthors = Chuang S, Hendrick EB, Humphreys RP | year = 1982 | month = September | title = Aneurysms of the vein of Galen. Experience at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto | journal = Journal of Neurosurgery | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–322 | issn = 0022-3085 | pmid = 7097326 | doi = 10.3171/jns.1982.57.3.0316}}</ref>

:Pattern 2: A single posterior choroidal artery drains into the vein of Galen.<ref name=hoffman />

:Pattern 3: One or both posterior choroidal and one or both anterior cerebral arteries drain directly into the Galenic system.<ref name=hoffman />

:Pattern 4: An angiomatous network of posterior choroidal and thalamic perforating arteries enter the Vein of Galen directly.<ref name=hoffman />

:Pattern 5: A high flow arteriovenous malformation in the right inferior frontal lobe drains via the inferior sagittal sinus and pericallosal vein into the Vein of Galen.<ref name=nicholson />

These malformations develop in utero by the persistence of fistulae between primitive pia arachnoidal arteries and plial veins that cross each other at right angles.<ref name=nicholson /> Because the primitive Galenic system and the primitive choroidal system lie close together, an arteriovenous malformation involving the primitive choroidal system will inevitably involve the Galenic vein.<ref>{{cite journal

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Vein of galen 3d.jpg|thumb|3D reconstruction of CTA showing vein of Galen malformation.]]
Malformations often lead to cardiac failure, cranial bruits (pattern 1), [[hydrocephaly]], and subarachnoid hemorrhage in neonates.<ref name=nicholson /> The heart failure is due to the size of the arteriovenous shunt that can steal 80% or more of the cardiac output, with large volumes of blood under high pressure returning to the right heart and pulmonary circulation and sinus venosus atrial septal defects.<ref name=nicholson /><ref name=mcelhinney /> It is also the most common cause of death in such patients.<ref name=johnston>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1227/00006123-198705000-00013 | author = Johnston IH | coauthors = Whittle IR, Besser M, Morgan MK | year = 1987 | month = May | title = Vein of Galen malformation: diagnosis and management | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 747–758 | issn = 0148-396X | pmid = 3601022}}</ref>

Non-developmental syndromes also directly or indirectly affect the Great Cerebral Vein of Galen, although they are extremely rare. These include superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), and thrombosis of the lateral sinus, superior sagittal sinus, internal jugular vein, or of the Great Cerebral Vein of Galen itself.

==Diagnosis==
Testing for a malformed vein of Galen is indicated when a patient has heart failure which has no obvious cause.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Vein of Galen Abnormalities | publisher = Duke University | url = http://www.dukehealth.org/services/cerebrovascular_center/treatments/vein_of_galen_abnormalitie | accessdate = December 6, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Diagnosis is generally achieved by signs such as [[cranial bruits]] and symptoms such as expanded facial veins.<ref name=nicholson /> The vein of Galen can be visualized using [[ultrasound]] or [[Medical_ultrasonography#Doppler_sonography|Doppler]].<ref name=nicholson /> A malformed Great Cerebral Vein will be noticeably enlarged. Ultrasound is a particularly useful tool for vein of Galen malformations because so many cases occur in infancy and ultrasound can make diagnoses prenatally. Many cases are diagnosed only during autopsy as congestive heart failure occurs very early.<ref name=hoffman />

==Treatment==

Treatment depends on the anatomy of the malformation as determined by [[angiography]] or [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI).<ref name=nicholson />

===Surgical===
Head circumference measurements should be obtained regularly and monitored carefully to detect [[hydrocephalus]]. Neurosurgical procedures to relieve hydrocephalus are important. A [[cerebral shunt|ventriculoperitoneal shunt]] may be required in some infants. A pediatric cardiologist should be consulted to manage high-output failure, if present. Often patients need to be intubated. In most cases, the fistulous arteries feeding into the Vein of Galen must be blocked, thereby reducing the blood flow into the vein.<ref name=hoffman /> Open surgery has a high morbidity and mortality.  Recent advances over the past few decades have made endovascular embolization the preferred method of treatment.  These treatments are preferred because they offer little threat to the surrounding brain tissue. However, there have been several reported cases of arteriovenous malformations recurring.<ref name=avmgroup>{{cite journal
| doi = 10.1056/NEJM199906103402307
| author = The Arteriovenous Malformation Study Group | date = June 10, 1999 | title = Arteriovenous Malformations of the Brain in Adults | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 340 | issue = 23 | pages = 1812–1818 | issn = 0028-4793 | pmid = 10362826 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/340/23/1812 | accessdate = October 27, 2009}}</ref> The young age of many patients, the complex vascular anatomy, and the sensitive location of the Vein of Galen offer considerable challenges to surgeons.<ref name=alexander /> Another treatment option is Radiotherapy. [[Radiotherapy]], also called [[radiosurgery]], involves the use of focused beams to damage the blood vessel.<ref name=avmgroup /> Radiotherapy is often not pursued as a treatment because the effects of the procedure can take months or years and there is risk of damaging adjacent brain tissue.<ref name=avmgroup />

===Medical Care===
Surgery is not always an option when the anatomy of the malformation creates too much of a risk. Recent improvements in [[endovascular surgery|endovascular]] procedures have made many cases, which were not surgically accessible, treatable.<ref name=avmgroup /> Endovascular treatments involve delivering drugs, balloons, or coils to the site of the malformation through blood vessels via catheters.<ref name=avmgroup /> These treatments work by limiting blood flow through the vein. There is, however, still risk of complications from endovascular treatments. The wall of the vein can be damaged during the procedure and, in some cases, the [[emboli]] can become dislodged and travel through the vascular system.<ref name=mcelhinney /> Two-dimensional [[echocardiography]] with color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate one fetus and five neonates with a Vein of Galen malformation.<ref name= Ciricillo>{{cite journal | author =  Ciricillo, S.F.  | coauthors = SCHMIDT K.G., SILVERMAN N.H., HIESHIMA G.B., HIGASHIDA R.T., HALBACH V.V., EDWARDS M.S.B | year = 1990 | title = Serial Ultrasonographic Evaluation of Neonatal Vein of Galen Malformations to Assess the Efficacy of Interventional Neuroradiological Procedures | journal = Neurosurgery (Baltimore) | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 544–548  | issn = 0148-396}}</ref> Color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler [[ultrasonography]] provided anatomical and pathophysiological information regarding cardiac [[hemodynamics]] and intracranial blood flow; with the patient's clinical status, these methods provided a reliable, noninvasive means to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the need for further treatment in neonates with Vein of Galen malformations.<ref name="Ciricillo"/> When none of these procedures are viable, shunting can be used to ameliorate the pressure inside the [[varicose vein|varix]].<ref name=nicholson /> [[Seizures]] usually are managed with antiepileptic medications.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Chatterjee | first = S. | title = Antiepileptic drugs | work = Molecules of the Millennium | publisher = Indian Journal of Pharmacology | date = May 22, 2009 | url = http://medind.nic.in/ibi/t01/i3/ibit01i3p229.pdf | accessdate = December 6, 2009 }}{{sic?}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The complications that are usually associated with vein of Galen malformations are usually intracranial hemorrhages.<ref name= Meyers>{{cite journal | doi =  10.1002/1531-8249(200006)47:6<748::AID-ANA7>3.0.CO;2-7 | author =  Meyers PM  | coauthors = Halbach VV, Phatouros CP, Dowd CF, Malek AM, Lempert TE, Lefler JE, Higashida RT | year = 2000 |month = June | title = Hemorrhagic complications in vein of Galen malformations | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 748–755 | pmid =  10852540 }}</ref> Over half the patients with VGAM have a malformation that cannot be corrected. Patients frequently die in the neonatal period or in early infancy.<ref name=mcelhinney />

==Society and culture==

Vein of Galen malformations are devastating complications. Studies have shown that 77% of untreated cases result in mortality.<ref name=alexander>{{cite book

Vein of Galen malformations are a relatively unknown affliction, attributed to the rareness of the malformations. Therefore, when a child is diagnosed with a faulty Great Cerebral Vein of Galen, most parents know little to nothing about what they are dealing with. To counteract this, support sites have been created which offer information, advice, and a community of support to the afflicted ([http://www.veinofgalen.co.uk/], [http://www.veinofgalen.org.nz/]).
