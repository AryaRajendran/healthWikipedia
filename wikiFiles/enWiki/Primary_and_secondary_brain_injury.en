'''Primary''' and '''secondary brain injury''' are ways to classify the injury processes that occur in [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]].  In [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), primary injury occurs during the initial insult, and results from displacement of the physical structures of the brain.<ref name="Valadka05"/> On the other hand, secondary injury occurs gradually and may involve an array of cellular processes.<ref name="Valadka05">

</ref> Tissues have a deformation threshold: if they are deformed past this threshold they are injured.<ref name="LaPlaca07"/>   Different regions in the brain may be more sensitive to mechanical loading due to differences in their properties that result from differences in their makeup; for example, [[myelin]]ated tissues may have different properties than other tissues.<ref name="LaPlaca07"/>  Thus some tissues may experience more force and be more injured in the primary injury.<ref name="LaPlaca07"/>   The primary injury leads to the secondary injury.<ref name="LaPlaca07"/>

</ref> This is often a result of secondary injury, which can damage even neurons that were unharmed in the primary injury. It occurs after a variety of brain insults including [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], stroke, and [[traumatic brain injury]] and involves [[metabolism|metabolic]] [[biochemical cascade|cascade]]s.<ref name="Marion03"/>

Secondary injury can result from complications of the injury.<ref name="Valadka05"/> These include [[ischemia]] (insufficient blood flow); cerebral [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (insufficient oxygen in the brain); [[hypotension]] (low [[blood pressure]]); [[cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain);  changes in the [[cerebral blood flow|blood flow to the brain]]; and raised [[intracranial pressure]] (the pressure within the skull).<ref name="Valadka05"/> If intracranial pressure gets too high, it can lead to deadly [[brain herniation]], in which parts of the brain are squeezed past structures in the skull.  

Other secondary insults include [[hypercapnia]] (excessive carbon dioxide levels in the blood), [[acidosis]] (excessively acidic blood),<ref name="Andrews003">

</ref>  [[meningitis]], and [[brain abscess]].<ref name="Gennarelli04"/>  In addition, alterations in the release of [[neurotransmitter]]s (the chemicals used by brain cells to communicate) can cause secondary injury. Imbalances in some neurotransmitters can lead to [[excitotoxicity]], damage to brain cells that results from overactivation of [[biochemical receptors]] for excitatory neurotransmitters (those that increase the likelihood that a [[neuron]] will [[action potential|fire]]).  Excitotoxicity can cause a variety of negative effects, including damage to cells by [[free radical]]s, potentially leading to [[neurodegeneration]]. Another factor in secondary injury is loss of cerebral autoregulation, the ability of the brain's blood vessels to regulate [[cerebral blood flow]].<ref name="Schiffer03"/> Other factors in secondary damage are breakdown of the [[blood–brain barrier]], edema, ischemia and hypoxia.<ref name="Garga06">

</ref> Similar mechanisms are involved in secondary injury after ischemia, trauma, and injuries resulting when a person does not get enough oxygen.<ref name="Schiffer03"/>  After stroke, an [[ischemic cascade]], a set of [[biochemical cascade]]s takes place.

==Prevention==
Since primary injury occurs at the moment of trauma and is over so rapidly, little can be done to interfere with it other than prevention of the trauma itself.<ref name="Valadka05"/>  However, since secondary injury occurs over time, it can be prevented in part by taking measures to prevent complications such as hypoxia. Furthermore, secondary injury presents opportunities for researchers to find drug therapies to limit or prevent the damage.  Since a variety of processes occur in secondary injury, any treatments that are developed to halt or mitigate it will need to address more than one of these mechanisms.<ref name="Marion03">

Thus efforts to reduce disability and death from TBI are thought to be best aimed at secondary injury, because the primary injury is thought to be irreversible.<ref name="Armin06">{{cite journal |author=Armin SS, Colohan AR, Zhang JH |title=Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage: Our current understanding and its evolution over the past half century |journal=Neurol.
