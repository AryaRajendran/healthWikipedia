'''Electrotherapy''' is the use of [[electrical energy]] as a medical treatment<ref>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, "''The IEEE standard dictionary of electrical and electronics terms''". 6th ed. New York, N.Y., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, c1997. IEEE Std 100-1996. ISBN 1-55937-833-6 [''ed''. Standards Coordinating Committee 10, Terms and Definitions; Jane Radatz, (chair)]</ref> In [[medicine]], the term ''electrotherapy'' can apply to a variety of treatments, including the use of electrical devices such as [[deep brain stimulation|deep brain stimulators]] for neurological disease. The term has also been applied specifically to the use of electric current to speed wound healing. Additionally, the term "electrotherapy" or "electromagnetic therapy" has also been applied to a range of [[alternative medicine|alternative medical]] devices and treatments.

It has not been found to be effective in increasing bone healing.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mollon B, da Silva V, Busse JW, Einhorn TA, Bhandari M|title=Electrical stimulation for long-bone fracture-healing: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials|journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am|volume=90|issue=11|pages=2322–30|year=2008|month=November|pmid=18978400|doi=10.2106/JBJS.H.00111}}</ref>

==History==
In 1855 [[Guillaume Duchenne]], the developer of electrotherapy, announced that [[Alternating current|alternating]] was superior to [[direct current]] for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions.<ref>Licht, Sidney Herman., "History of Electrotherapy", in Therapeutic Electricity and Ultraviolet Radiation, 2nd ed., ed. Sidney Licht, New Haven: E. Licht, 1967, Pp. 1-70.</ref> What he called the 'warming affect' of direct currents irritated the skin, since, at voltage strengths needed for muscle contractions, they cause the skin to blister (at the [[anode]]) and pit (at the [[cathode]]). Furthermore, with DC each contraction required the current to be stopped and restarted. Moreover alternating current could produce strong muscle contractions regardless of the condition of the muscle, whereas DC-induced contractions were strong if the muscle was strong, and weak if the muscle was weak.

Since that time almost all rehabilitation involving muscle contraction has been done with a symmetrical rectangular biphasic waveform. During the 1940s, however, the [[U.S. War Department]], investigating the application of electrical stimulation not just to retard and prevent atrophy but to restore muscle mass and strength, employed what was termed ''galvanic exercise'' on the atrophied hands of patients who had an ulnar nerve lesion from surgery upon a wound.<ref>Licht, "History of Electrotherapy"</ref> These Galvanic exercises employed a monophasic wave form, direct current.

In the field of cancer treatment, DC electrotherapy showed promise as early as 1959, when a study published in the journal ''Science'' reported total destruction of tumor in 60% of subjects, which was very noteworthy for an initial study.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=C.E.|coauthors=Seal, E.H.|title=Biophysical approach toward tumor regression in mice|journal=Science|year=1959|volume=130|pages=388–390}}</ref> 
In 1985, the journal CANCER RESEARCH published the most remarkable such study, reporting 98% shrinkage of tumor in animal subjects on being treated with DC electrotherapy for only 5 hours over 5 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last=David|first=S.L|coauthors=Absolom, D.R., Smith, C.R., Gams, J., and Herbert, M.A.|title=Effect of low level direct current on in vivo tumor growth in hamsters|journal=Cancer Research|year=1985|volume=45|pages=5625–5631}}</ref>
The mechanism for the effectiveness of DC electrotherapy in treating cancer was suggested in an article published in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kulsh|first=J.|title=Targeting a key enzyme in cell growth: a novel therapy for cancer|journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=1997|volume=49|pages=297–300}}</ref> The free-radical (unpaired electron) containing active-site of enzyme Ribonucleotide Reductase, RnR—which controls the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of DNA—can be disabled by a stream of passing electrons.

==Current use==
Although a 1999 meta-analysis found that electrotherapy could speed the healing of wounds,<ref name=Gardner1999/> in 2000 the Dutch Medical Council found that although it was widely used, there was insufficient evidence for its benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bouter LM|title=[Insufficient scientific evidence for efficacy of widely used electrotherapy, laser therapy, and ultrasound treatment in physiotherapy]|language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd|volume=144|issue=11|pages=502–5|year=2000|month=March|pmid=10735134}}</ref> Since that time, a few publications have emerged that seem to support its efficacy, but data is still scarce.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nicolakis P, Kollmitzer J, Crevenna R, Bittner C, Erdogmus CB, Nicolakis J|title=Wien Klin|Wochenschr|year=2002|month=Aug|pages=21–22|pmid=12602111|volume=114|issue=15–16|journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift}}</ref>

The use of electrotherapy has been researched and accepted in the field of rehabilitation<ref>Robinson AJ, Snyder-Mackler, L. Clinical electrophysiology: electrotherapy and electrophysiologic testing 3rd ed. Baltimore: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2008;151-196, 198-237, 239-274</ref> ([[electrical muscle stimulation]]).

Some of the treatment effectiveness mechanisms are little understood, with effectiveness and best practices for their use still anecdotal.

Electrotherapy devices have been studied in the treatment of chronic wounds and [[pressure ulcer]]s. A 1999 [[meta-analysis]] of published trials found some evidence that electrotherapy could speed the healing of such wounds, though it was unclear which devices were most effective and which types of wounds were most likely to benefit.<ref name=Gardner1999>{{cite journal|author=Gardner SE, Frantz RA, Schmidt FL|title=Effect of electrical stimulation on chronic wound healing: a meta-analysis|journal=Wound Repair Regen|volume=7|issue=6|pages=495–503|year=1999|pmid=10633009|doi=10.1046/j.1524-475X.1999.00495.x}}</ref> However, a more detailed review by the [[Cochrane Library]] found no evidence that [[electromagnetic therapy]], a subset of electrotherapy, was effective in healing pressure ulcers<ref>{{cite journal|author=Olyaee Manesh A, Flemming K, Cullum NA, Ravaghi H|editor1-last=Olyaee Manesh|editor1-first=Alireza|title=Electromagnetic therapy for treating pressure ulcers|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|issue=2|pages=CD002930|year=2006|pmid=16625564|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002930.pub3}}</ref> or [[venous stasis ulcer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ravaghi H, Flemming K, Cullum N, Olyaee Manesh A|editor1-last=Ravaghi|editor1-first=Hamid|title=Electromagnetic therapy for treating venous leg ulcers|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|issue=2|pages=CD002933|year=2006|pmid=16625565|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002933.pub3}}</ref>
