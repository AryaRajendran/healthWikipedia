'''Retinitis pigmentosa''' ('''RP''') is an inherited, degenerative  [[Human eye|eye]] disease that causes severe vision impairment and often blindness.<ref name=Roska/> The progress of RP is not consistent.  Some people will exhibit symptoms from infancy, others may not notice symptoms until later in life.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Koenekoop R.K. | year = 2003 | title = Novel RPGR mutations with distinct retinitis pigmentosa phenotypes in French-Canadian families | url = | journal = American journal of ophthalmology | volume = 136 | issue = 4| pages = 678–68 }}</ref>  Generally, the later the onset, the more rapid is the deterioration in sight. Also notice that people who do not have RP have 90 degree peripheral vision, while some people that have RP have less than 90 degree.

A form of retinal [[Retinopathy|dystrophy]], RP is caused by abnormalities of the [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s ([[rod cell|rod]]s and [[cone cell|cone]]s) or the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) of the [[retina]] leading to progressive sight loss. Affected individuals may experience defective light to dark, dark to light adaptation or [[nyctalopia]] (night blindness), as the result of the degeneration of the [[peripheral vision|peripheral visual field]] (known as tunnel vision).  Sometimes, central vision is lost first causing the person to look sidelong at objects.

The effect of RP is best illustrated by comparison to a television or computer screen.  The pixels of light that form the image on the screen equate to the millions of light receptors on the retina of the eye.  The fewer pixels on a screen, the less distinct will be the images it will display.  Fewer than 10 percent of the light receptors in the eye receive the colored, high intensity light seen in bright light or daylight conditions.  These receptors are located in the center of the circular retina.  The remaining 90 percent of light receptors receive gray-scale, low intensity light used for low light and night vision and are located around the periphery of the retina.  RP destroys light receptors  from the outside inward, from the center outward, or in sporadic patches with a corresponding reduction in the efficiency of the eye to detect light.  This degeneration is progressive and has no known cure as of June 2012.

The most challenging aspect of RP is that it is not stable.  Sufferers must continually adapt to less and less sight and how that impacts their life, career and relationships.  Another aspect is that RP sufferers do not look different.  RP does not result in any outward effect on the eyes and so people with RP "do not look blind".  Furthermore, though legally blind because of reduced field of vision or acuity, they may be able to see things that hold in their line of sight long enough (if bright enough) to comprehend e.g. see large or bright objects albeit indistinctly.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Human eyesight two children and ball normal vision.jpg|thumb||Normal vision.]]
[[Image:Human eyesight two children and ball with retinitis pigmentosa or tunnel vision.png|thumb|The same view with tunnel vision from retinitis pigmentosa. The blackness surrounding the central image does not indicate darkness, but rather a lack of perceived visual information.]]
People may experience one or more of the following symptoms:
* Night blindness or [[nyctalopia]];  
* Tunnel vision (no peripheral vision);
* Peripheral vision (no central vision);
* Latticework vision; 
* Aversion to glare; 
* Slow adjustment from dark to light environments and vice versa; 
* Blurring of vision;
* Poor color separation; and 
* Extreme tiredness.  

=== Associated conditions ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is seen in a variety of diseases, so the differential of this sign alone is broad.

*RP combined with [[deafness]] (congenital or progressive) is called [[Usher syndrome]].
*RP combined with [[opthalmoplegia]], [[dysphagia]], [[ataxia]], and cardiac conduction defects is seen in the [[mitochondrial]] DNA disorder [[Kearns-Sayre syndrome]] (also known as Ragged Red Fiber [[Myopathy]])
*RP combined with retardation, [[peripheral neuropathy]], acanthotic (spiked) RBCs, ataxia, [[steatorrhea]], is absence of VLDL is seen in [[abetalipoproteinemia]].
*RP is seen clinically in association with several other rare genetic disorders (including muscular dystrophy and chronic granulomatous disease) as part of [[McLeod syndrome]].  This is an X-linked recessive phenotype characterized by a complete absence of XK cell surface proteins, and therefore markedly reduced expression of all Kell red blood cell antigens.  For transfusion purposes these patients are considered completely incompatible with all normal and K0/K0 donors.

Other conditions include [[neurosyphilis]], [[toxoplasmosis]]([http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1227488-diagnosis Emedicine "Retinitis Pigmentosa"]) and Refsum's disease.

==Genetics==
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common forms of inherited retinal [[Degenerative disease|degeneration]].<ref name="Hartong">{{cite journal |author=Hartong DT, Berson EL, Dryja TP |title=Retinitis pigmentosa |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9549 |pages=1795–809 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17113430 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69740-7 |url=}}</ref> This disorder is characterized by the progressive loss of [[photoreceptor cell]]s and may eventually lead to blindness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Farrar GJ, Kenna PF, Humphries P |title=On the genetics of retinitis pigmentosa and on mutation-independent approaches to therapeutic intervention |journal=EMBO J. |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=857–64 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11867514 |pmc=125887 |doi=10.1093/emboj/21.5.857 |url=}}</ref>

There are multiple [[genes]] that, when mutated, can cause the Retinitis pigmentosa [[phenotype]].<ref>{{OMIM|268000|RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA; RP}}</ref> In 1989, a [[mutation]] of the gene for [[rhodopsin]], a [[pigment]] that plays an essential part in the [[Visual phototransduction|visual transduction cascade]] enabling vision in low-light conditions, was identified. Since then, more than 100 mutations have been found in this gene, accounting for 15% of all types of [[Retinopathy|retinal degeneration]]. Most of those mutations are [[missense mutation]]s and inherited mostly in a [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] manner.

The rhodopsin gene [[Coding strand|encodes]] a principal protein of photoreceptor outer segments. Studies show that mutations in this gene are responsible for approximately 25% of [[dominance (genetics)#Autosomal dominant gene|autosomal dominant]] forms of RP.<ref name="Hartong"/><ref name="Berson EL, Rosner B, Sandberg MA, Dryja TP 1991 92–101">{{cite journal |author=Berson EL, Rosner B, Sandberg MA, Dryja TP |title=Ocular findings in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and a rhodopsin gene defect (Pro-23-His) |journal=Arch. Ophthalmol. |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=92–101 |year=1991 |month=January |pmid=1987956 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Mutations in four [[pre-mRNA]] [[splicing factors]] are known to cause [[autosomal dominant]] retinitis pigmentosa. These are [[PRPF3]] (human PRPF3 is HPRPF3; also PRP3), [[PRPF8]], [[PRPF31]] and [[RP9|PAP1]]. These factors are ubiquitously expressed and it is proposed that defects in a ubiquitous factor (a protein expressed everywhere) should only cause disease in the [[retina]] because the retinal photoreceptor cells have a far greater requirement for protein processing ([[rhodopsin]]) than any other cell type.<ref>{{cite PMID|19578015}}</ref> 

Up to 150 mutations have been reported to date in the [[opsin]] gene associated with the RP since the Pro23His mutation in the intradiscal domain of the protein was first reported in 1990. These mutations are found throughout the opsin gene and are distributed along the three domains of the protein (the intradiscal, [[transmembrane]], and [[cytoplasmic]] [[Protein domain|domains]]). One of the main biochemical causes of RP in the case of rhodopsin mutations is [[protein folding|protein misfolding]], and [[molecular chaperones]] have also been involved in RP.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Senin II, Bosch L, Ramon E, ''et al.'' |title=Ca<sup>2+</sup>/recoverin dependent regulation of phosphorylation of the rhodopsin mutant R135L associated with retinitis pigmentosa |journal=Biochem.

==Pathophysiology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}Retinitis pigmentosa (commonly referred to as "RP") is a disease characterised by loss of the light sensing [[photoreceptor]] cells that line the back of the eye, like the film of a camera. Usually the rod photoreceptors (responsible for night vision) are affected first, which is why loss of night vision ([[nyctalopia]]) is usually the first symptom. Loss of daytime vision (mediated by the cone photoreceptors) is usually preserved until the late stages of the disease. Mottling of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] with black ''bone-spicule'' pigmentation is typically indicative (or [[pathognomonic]]) of retinitis pigmentosa. Other [[human eye|ocular]] features include waxy [[pallor]] of the [[optic nerve]] head, attenuation (thinning) of the [[retinal]] vessels,[[maculopathy|cellophane maculopathy]], [[cystic]] macular [[edema]], and [[cataract|posterior subcapsular cataract]].

==Diagnosis==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of retinitis pigmentosa relies upon documentation of progressive loss in [[photoreceptor cell]] function by [[electroretinography]] (ERG) and [[visual field test]]ing.

The mode of [[inheritance]] of RP is determined by family history. At least 35 different [[gene]]s or[[Locus (genetics)|loci]] are known to cause "nonsyndromic RP" (RP that is not the result of another disease or part of a wider [[syndrome]]).

[[DNA testing]] is available on a clinical basis for:
* {{Gene|RLBP1}} (autosomal recessive, Bothnia type RP)
* {{Gene|RP1}} (autosomal dominant, RP1)
* {{Gene|RHO}} (autosomal dominant, RP4)
* {{Gene|RDS}} (autosomal dominant, RP7)
* {{Gene|PRPF8}} (autosomal dominant, RP13)
* {{Gene|PRPF3}} (autosomal dominant, RP18)
* [[CRB1]] (autosomal recessive, RP12)
* {{Gene|ABCA4}} (autosomal recessive, RP19)
* {{Gene|RPE65}} (autosomal recessive, RP20)

For all other genes (e.g. [[dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase|DHDDS]]), molecular [[genetic testing]]is available on a research basis only.

RP can be inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]], [[autosomal recessive]], or [[Sex linkage|X-linked]]manner. X-linked RP can be either [[recessive]], affecting primarily only males, or [[dominant allele|dominant]], affecting both males and females, although males are usually more mildly affected. Some digenic (controlled by two genes) and [[mitochondrial]] forms have also been described.

[[Genetic counseling]] depends on an accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing.

==Treatment==
Currently there is no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, but treatments are now available in some countries. The progression of the disease can be reduced by the daily intake of 15000 [[International unit|IU]] (equivalent to 4.5&nbsp;mg) of [[vitamin A palmitate]] in some patients.<ref name="pmid8512476">{{cite journal |author=Berson EL, Rosner B, Sandberg MA, ''et al.'' |title=A randomized trial of vitamin A and vitamin E supplementation for retinitis pigmentosa |journal=Arch. Ophthalmol. |volume=111 |issue=6 |pages=761–72 |year=1993 |pmid=8512476 |doi=}}</ref> Recent studies have shown that proper [[vitamin A]] supplementation can postpone blindness by up to 10 years (by reducing the 10% loss pa to 8.3% pa) in some patients in certain stages of the disease.<ref name="pmid17531222">{{cite journal |author=Berson EL |title=Long-term visual prognoses in patients with retinitis pigmentosa: the Ludwig von Sallmann lecture |journal=Exp.

The Argus II retinal implant has also received [http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm339824.htm market approval in the USA]. The device may help adults with RP who have lost the ability to perceive shapes and movement to be more mobile and to perform day-to-day activities.
