The '''10% of brain myth''' is the widely perpetuated [[urban legend]] that most or all [[human]]s only make use of 20%, 10% or some other small [[percent]]age of their [[human brain|brains]]. It has been misattributed to people including [[Albert Einstein]].<ref name="sciam">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=people-only-use-10-percent-of-brain| title=Do People Only Use 10 Percent Of Their Brains| publisher=[[Scientific American]]| date=7 February 2008| accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> By association, it is suggested that a person may harness this unused potential and increase [[intelligence]].

==Origin==
One possible origin is the [[reserve energy]] theories by Harvard psychologists [[William James]] and [[Boris Sidis]] in the 1890s who tested the theory in the accelerated raising of child prodigy [[William Sidis]] to effect an adulthood [[IQ]] of 250–300; thus William James told audiences that people only meet a fraction of their full mental potential, which is a plausible claim.<ref>{{cite web | title = Debunking Common Brain Myths | url = http://bigthink.com/ideas/14786| accessdate= 24 May 2011 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> In 1936, American writer [[Lowell Thomas]] summarized this idea (in a foreword to [[Dale Carnegie]]'s ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'') by adding a falsely precise percentage: “Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten per cent of his latent mental ability."<ref>{{cite web | title = A Shortcut to Distinction | url = http://www.cyberspacei.com/englishwiz/library/friends/how_to_win_friends.htm| accessdate= 24 May 2011 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>

According to a related origin story, the 10% myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding (or misrepresentation) of neurological research in the late 19th century or early 20th century. For example, the functions of many brain regions (especially in the [[cerebral cortex]]) are complex enough that the effects of damage are subtle, leading early neurologists to wonder what these regions did.<ref>{{cite book | title = Welcome to Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys but Never Forget How to Drive and Other Puzzles of Everyday Life | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9KmDhPtIcoMC&pg=PR19&lpg=PR19&dq=sam+wang+user+guide+to+brain#v=onepage&q=sam%20wang%20user%20guide%20to%20brain&f=false | author = "Wang, Sam and Aamodt, Sandra | isbn = 9781596912830 | date = 2008-02-02| accessdate= 25 September 2011 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> The brain was also discovered to consist mostly of [[glial cells]], which seemed to have very minor functions. Dr. James W. Kalat, author of the textbook ''Biological Psychology'', points out that neuroscientists in the 1930s knew about the large number of "local" neurons in the brain. The misunderstanding of the function of local neurons may have led to the 10% myth.<ref>Kalat, J.W., ''Biological Psychology'', sixth edition, Pacific Grove: Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., 1998, p. 43.</ref> Indeed, it is easy to imagine that the myth propagated simply by a truncation of the statement that "humans use 10% of their brains at any given time."

Although parts of the brain have broadly understood functions, many mysteries remain about how brain cells (i.e., neurons and glia) work together to produce complex behaviors and disorders. Perhaps the broadest, most mysterious question is how diverse regions of the brain collaborate to form conscious experiences. So far, there is no evidence that there is one site for consciousness, which leads experts to believe that it is truly a collective neural effort.  Therefore, as with James's idea that humans have untapped cognitive potential, it also is fair to say that a large fraction of questions about the brain have not been fully answered.<ref name=sciam />

The origin has also been attributed to Dr. [[Wilder Penfield]], the U.S.-born neurosurgeon who was the first director of [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] of [[McGill University]]<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/consciousness-and-the-brain/201106/do-we-use-only-10-percent-our-brain Do we use only 10 percent of our brain? | Psychology Today<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

This theory could also be because of the human subconsciousness, which would mean that you only '''consciously''' use 10% of your brain, and the other 90% (such as heart functions, hearing, seeing, breathing etc) are left to your subconsciousness, and are autonomous. This would seem to be a probable meaning.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

==Refutation==
Neurologist Barry Gordon describes the myth as laughably false, adding, "we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time".<ref name="sciam" /> Neuroscientist [[Barry Beyerstein]] sets out seven kinds of evidence refuting the ten percent myth:<ref name="beyerstein">{{cite book|last=Beyerstein|first=Barry L.|title=Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain|editor=Sergio Della Sala|publisher=Wiley|year=1999|pages=3–24|chapter=Whence Cometh the Myth that We Only Use 10% of our Brains?|isbn=0-471-98303-9}}</ref>

* Studies of brain damage: If 90% of the brain is normally unused, then damage to these areas should not impair performance. Instead, there is almost no area of the brain that can be damaged without loss of abilities. Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have profound effects.
* Brain scans have shown that no matter what we're doing, our brains are always active. Some areas are more active at any one time than others, but unless we have brain damage, there is no one part of the brain that is absolutely not functioning.
* Evolution: The brain is enormously costly to the rest of the body, in terms of oxygen and nutrient consumption. It can require up to 20% of the body's energy&mdash;more than any other organ&mdash;despite making up only 2% of the human body by weight.<ref name="power-sciam">{{cite web|last=Swaminathan|first=Nikhil|title=Why Does the Brain Need So Much Power?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-the-brain-need-s|work=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc.|accessdate=19 November 2010|date=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref name=CarpenterCh1>[[#refCarpenter|''Carpenter's Human Neuroanatomy'']], Ch. 1</ref> If 90% of it were unnecessary, there would be a large survival advantage to humans with smaller, more efficient brains. If this were true, the process of [[natural selection]] would have eliminated the inefficient brains. It is also highly unlikely that a brain with so much redundant matter would have evolved in the first place.
* Brain imaging: Technologies such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) allow the activity of the living brain to be monitored. They reveal that even during [[sleep]], all parts of the brain show some level of activity. Only in the case of serious damage does a brain have "silent" areas.
* Localization of function: Rather than acting as a single mass, the brain has [[Localization of brain function|distinct regions for different kinds of information processing]]. Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.
* Microstructural analysis: In the [[single-unit recording]] technique, researchers insert a tiny electrode into the brain to monitor the activity of a single cell. If 90% of cells were unused, then this technique would have revealed that.
* Neural disease: Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate. Hence if 90% of the brain were inactive, [[autopsy]] of adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration.

Another evolutionary argument is that, given the historical risk of death in childbirth associated with the large brain size (and therefore skull size) of humans,<ref>Rosenberg, K.R., 'The Evolution of Modern Childbirth' in ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' 35, 1992, p. 89-124.</ref> there would be a strong selection pressure against such a large brain size if only 10% was actually in use.

In the [[MythBusters (2010_season)#Episode_151_-_Tablecloth_Chaos|October 27, 2010 episode]] of ''[[MythBusters]]'', the hosts used [[magnetoencephalography]] and functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brain of someone attempting a complicated mental task. Finding that well over 10% was active at once, they declared the myth "busted".

==Perpetuation in pop culture==
Several books, films and short stories have been written closely related to this myth, as well as greatly expanded intelligence, artificially caused and otherwise, in general. The most notable of these is the novel ''[[The Dark Fields]]'', and its film adaptation ''[[Limitless]]'', which operates under the notion that the rest of the brain could be accessed through use of a drug.<ref name="msnbc news ref">{{cite web|last=Bahn|first=Christopher|title='Limitless' brainpower plot isn't all that crazy|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41953704/ns/today-entertainment/|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'' alleges that humans only use 5% of their brains as a potential explanation of a "sixth sense" in zombies. 

Other works involving artificial intellectual enhancement include ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'', the short stories "[[Understand (story)|Understand]]" by [[Ted Chiang]] as well as "[[Lest We Remember]]" (which actually features [[eidetic memory|total recall]], a different concept based on similar premises) and "[[Foundation and Empire]] "by [[Isaac Asimov]]. These, however, do not imply that the human brain is, or should be inherently capable of, this exponential growth, while in the "Foundation" it is claimed by the person using it, but he was established earlier to have no formal education.

The 10% brain myth occurs frequently in advertisements,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/tenper.html| title=Neuroscience For Kids| publisher=Eric H.

In the novel ''[[The Dead Zone]]'', the protagonist's ability to see the future is attributed to the reactivation of a dormant part of his brain (Albeit caused to compensate for brain damage suffered while he was in a coma).

Some [[New Age]] proponents propagate this belief by asserting that the "unused" ninety percent of the human brain is capable of exhibiting [[psionics|psychic powers]] and can be trained to perform [[psychokinesis]] and [[extra-sensory perception]].<ref name="snopes10pct" /><ref name="beyerstein" />  There is no scientifically verified body of evidence supporting the existence of such powers.<ref name="beyerstein" />

The core premise of the 1991 romantic comedy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' is that people on Earth only use 3-5% of their brain and spend their time on Earth conquering fear.  Once Earthlings, referred to as "Little Brains" conquer fear and learn to use more of their cognitive power, they graduate to a higher plane.  Otherwise their soul is reincarnated and they are sent back to Earth to try again.
