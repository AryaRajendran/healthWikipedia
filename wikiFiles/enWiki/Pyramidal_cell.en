'''Pyramidal neurons''' (pyramidal cells) are a type of [[neuron]] found in areas of the brain including [[cerebral cortex]], the [[hippocampus]], and in the [[amygdala]].  Pyramidal neurons are the primary excitation units of the mammalian [[prefrontal cortex]] and the [[corticospinal tract]].  Pyramidal neurons were first discovered and studied by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]].<ref name="Elston">{{cite journal |author=Elston GN |title=Cortex, cognition and the cell: new insights into the pyramidal neuron and prefrontal function |journal=Cereb.

===Features===
One of the main structural features of the pyramidal neuron is the triangular shaped [[soma (biology)|soma]], or cell body, after which the neuron is named.  Other key structural features of the pyramidal cell are a single [[axon]], a large [[apical dendrite]], multiple [[basal dendrite]]s, and the presence of [[dendritic spines]].<ref name = "Megias">{{cite journal |author=Megías M, Emri Z, Freund TF, Gulyás AI |title=Total number and distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells |journal=Neuroscience |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=527–40 |year=2001 |pmid=11226691 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(00)00496-6 |url=}}</ref>

====Apical dendrite====
The apical dendrites arise from the apex of the pyramidal cell's soma.  The apical dendrite is a single long thick dendrite that branches several times as distance from the soma increases.<ref name = "Megias" />  

====Basal dendrite====
The basal dendrites arise from the base of the pyramidal cell's soma.  The basal dendritic tree consists of three to five primary dendrites.  As distance increases from the soma, the basal dendrites branch profusely.<ref name = "Megias" />

Pyramidal cells are among the largest neurons in the brain.  Both in humans and rodents, pyramidal cell bodies (somas) average around ~ 20μm. Pyramidal dendrites typically range in diameter from half a micrometer to several micrometers.  The length of a single dendrite is usually several hundred micrometers.  Due to branching, the total dendritic length of a pyramidal cell may reach several centimeters.  The pyramidal cell’s axon is often even longer and extensively branched, reaching many centimeters in total length.

===Dendritic spines===

[[Dendritic spines]] receive most of the excitatory impulses ([[EPSP]]s) that enter a pyramidal cell.  Dendritic spines were first noted by Ramón y Cajal in 1888 by using [[Golgi's method]].  Ramón y Cajal was also the first person to propose a physiological role of dendritic spines: increase the receptive surface area of the neuron.  The greater the pyramidal cell's surface area, the greater the neuron's ability to process and integrate large amounts of information.  Dendritic spines are absent on the soma, and the number of spines increases away from it.<ref name ="Pablo" /> The typical apical dendrite in a rat has at least 3000 dendritic spines.  The average human apical dendrite is approximately twice the length of a rat's, so the number of dendritic spines present on a human apical dendrite could be as high as 6000.<ref name="LaBerge">{{cite journal |author=Laberge D, Kasevich R |title=The apical dendrite theory of consciousness |journal=Neural Netw |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=1004–20 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17920812 |doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2007.09.006 |url=}}</ref>

==Growth and development==
===Differentiation===

Pyramidal [[specification]] occurs during early development of the cerebrum.  [[Progenitor cells]] are committed to the neuronal lineage in the [[subcortical proliferative ventricular zone]] (VZ) and the [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ).  Immature pyramidal cells undergo migration to occupy the [[cortical plate]], where they further diversify.  [[Endocannabinoids]] (eCBs) are one class of molecules that have been shown to direct pyramidal cell development and axonal pathfinding.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mulder J, Aguado T, Keimpema E, ''et al.'' |title=Endocannabinoid signaling controls pyramidal cell specification and long-range axon patterning |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=25 |pages=8760–5 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18562289 |pmc=2438381 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0803545105 |url=}}</ref> [[Growth factors]] such as Ctip2 and Sox5 have been shown to contribute to the direction in which pyramidal neurons direct their axons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fishell G, Hanashima C |title=Pyramidal neurons grow up and change their mind |journal=Neuron |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=333–8 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18255026 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.01.018 |url=}}</ref>

===Early postnatal development===

Pyramidal cells in rats have been shown to undergo many rapid changes during early [[postnatal]] life.  Between postnatal days 3 and 21, pyramidal cells have been shown to double in the size of the soma, increase in length of the apical dendrite by fivefold, and increase in basal dendrite length by thirteenfold.  Other changes include the lowering of the membrane’s [[resting potential]], reduction of membrane resistance, and in increase in the peak values of [[action potential]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang ZW |title=Maturation of layer V pyramidal neurons in the rat prefrontal cortex: intrinsic properties and synaptic function |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=1171–82 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14602839 |doi=10.1152/jn.00855.2003 |url=}}</ref>

==Signaling==

Like dendrites in most other neurons, the dendrites are generally the input areas of the neuron, while the axon is the neuron’s output.  Both axons and dendrites are highly branched.  The large amount of branching allows the neuron to send and receive signals to and from many different neurons.

Pyramidal neurons, like other neurons, have numerous [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s.  In pyramidal cells, there is an abundance of Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> channels in the dendrites, and some channels in the soma.  Ion channels within pyramidal cell dendrites have different properties from the same ion channel type within the pyramidal cell soma.  Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in pyramidal cell dendrites are activated by subthreshold [[EPSP]]s and by [[Neural backpropagation|back-propagating]] action potentials.  The extent of back-propagation of action potentials within pyramidal dendrites depends upon the K<sup>+</sup> channels.  K<sup>+</sup> channels in pyramidal cell dendrites provide a mechanism for controlling the amplitude of action potentials.<ref name = "Magee">{{cite journal |author=Magee J, Hoffman D, Colbert C, Johnston D |title=Electrical and calcium signaling in dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons |journal=Annu. Rev. Physiol. |volume=60 |issue= 1|pages=327–46 |year=1998 |pmid=9558467 |doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.60.1.327 |url=}}</ref>  

The ability of pyramidal neurons to integrate information depends on the number and distribution of the synaptic inputs they receive.  A single pyramidal cell receives about 30,000 excitatory inputs and 1700 inhibitory ([[IPSP]]s) inputs.  Excitatory (EPSPs) inputs terminate exclusively on the dendritic spines, while inhibitory (IPSPs) inputs terminate on dendritic shafts, the soma, and even the axon.  Pyramidal neurons use [[glutamate]] as their excitatory [[neurotransmitter]], and [[GABA]] as their inhibitory neurotransmitter.<ref name = "Megias" />

===Firing Classification of Pyramidal Neurons===
Pyramidal neurons have been classified into different subclasses based upon their firing responses to 400-1000 millisecond current pulses.  These classification are RSad, RSna, and IB neurons.
====RSad Pyramidal Neurons====
RSad pyramidal neurons, or adapting regular spiking neurons, fire with individual [[action potential]]s (APs), which are followed by a [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizing]] afterpotential.  The afterpotential increases in duration which creates [[Action potential|spike frequency]] [[Neural adaptation|adaptation]] (SFA) in the neuron.<ref name = "Frances">{{cite journal |author=Franceschetti S, Sancini G, Panzica F, Radici C, Avanzini G |title=Postnatal differentiation of firing properties and morphological characteristics in layer V pyramidal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex |journal=Neuroscience |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=1013–24 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9502243 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(97)00463-6 |url=}}</ref>

====RSna Pyramidal Neurons====
RSna pyramidal neurons, or non-adapting regular spiking neurons, fire a train of action potentials after a pulse.  These neurons fail to show any signs of adaptation.<ref name="Frances" />
====IB Pyramidal Neurons====
IB pyramidal neurons, or intrinsically bursting neurons, respond to [[Threshold potential|threshold]] pulses with a burst of two to five rapid action potentials.  IB pyramidal neurons show no adaptation.<ref name="Frances" />

==Function==
===Corticospinal tract===

Pyramidal neurons are the primary neural cell type in the [[corticospinal tract]].  Normal motor control depends on the development of connections between the axons in the corticospinal tract and the spinal cord.  Pyramidal cell axons follow cues such as growth factors to make specific connections.  With proper connections, pyramidal cells take part in the circuitry responsible for vision guided motor function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salimi I, Friel KM, Martin JH |title=Pyramidal tract stimulation restores normal corticospinal tract connections and visuomotor skill after early postnatal motor cortex activity blockade |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=28 |issue=29 |pages=7426–34 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18632946 |pmc=2567132 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1078-08.2008 |url=}}</ref>

===Cognition===

Pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex are implicated in cognitive ability.  In mammals, the complexity of pyramidal cells increases from [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] to [[anterior]] brain regions.  The degree of complexity of pyramidal neurons is likely linked to the cognitive capabilities of different anthropoid species.  Because the prefrontal cortex receives inputs from areas of the brain that are involved in processing all the sensory modalities, pyramidal cells within the prefrontal cortex may process many different types of inputs.  Pyramidal cells may play a critical role in complex object recognition within the visual processing areas of the cortex.<ref name = "Elston" />
