'''Chemotherapy''' (often abbreviated to '''''chemo''''') is the treatment of [[cancer]] with one or more [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] '''anti[[neoplastic]]''' drugs ("chemotherapeutic agents") as part of a [[chemotherapy regimen|standardized regimen]]. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|palliate symptoms]]. It is often used in conjunction with other cancer treatments, such as [[radiation therapy]] or [[surgery]]. Certain chemotherapeutic agents also have a role in the treatment of other conditions, including [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[scleroderma]]. 

Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, one of the main properties of most cancer cells. This means that chemotherapy also harms cells that divide rapidly under normal circumstances: cells in the [[bone marrow]], [[digestive tract]], and [[hair follicle]]s. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: [[myelosuppression]] (decreased production of blood cells, hence also [[immunosuppression]]), [[mucositis]] (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and [[alopecia]] (hair loss).

Some newer anticancer drugs (for example, various [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|monoclonal antibodies]]) are not indiscriminately cytotoxic, but rather target proteins that are abnormally expressed in cancer cells and that are essential for their growth. Such treatments are often referred to as [[targeted therapy]] (as distinct from classic chemotherapy) and are often used alongside traditional chemotherapeutic agents in antineoplastic treatment regimens.

An older and broader usage of the word chemotherapy encompassed any chemical treatment of disease (for example, treatment of infections with [[antimicrobial]] agents). However, this usage has become [[Archaism|archaic]].

[[File:Sidney Farber nci-vol-1926-300.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sidney Farber]] is regarded as the father of modern chemotherapy.]]
The first use of drugs to treat cancer was in the early 20th century, although it was not originally intended for that purpose. [[Mustard gas]] was used as a [[chemical warfare]] agent during [[World War I]] and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of [[hematopoiesis]] (blood production).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krumbhaar EB |title=tole of the blood and the bone marrow in certain forms of gas poisoning |journal=JAMA |volume=72 |pages=39–41 |year=1919 }}</ref> A similar family of compounds known as [[nitrogen mustards]] were studied further during [[World War II]] at Yale University.<ref name="gilman">{{cite journal |author=Gilman A |title=The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard |journal=Am.

===The term ''chemotherapy''===
The word "chemotherapy" without a modifier usually refers to cancer treatment, but its historical meaning is broader. The term was historically used for non-[[Oncology|oncological]] references, such as the use of [[antibiotic]]s (''antibacterial chemotherapy''). The first modern chemotherapeutic agent was [[arsphenamine]], an arsenic compound discovered in 1909 and used to treat [[syphilis]].<ref name="pmid19868743">{{cite journal |author=Nichols HJ, Walker JE |title=Experimental observations on the prophyaxis and treatment of syphilis |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=525–42 |year=1923 |month=March |pmid=19868743 |pmc=2128372}}</ref> This was later followed by [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] (sulfa drugs) and [[penicillin]]. Other uses that have been termed chemotherapy are the treatment of [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[dermatomyositis]], [[polymyositis]], [[lupus]], and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Principles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
[[Cancer]] is the uncontrolled growth of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s coupled with [[malignant]] behavior: invasion and [[metastasis]].  Cancer is thought to be caused by the interaction between [[gene]]tic susceptibility and environmental toxins.

In the broad sense, most ''chemotherapeutic'' drugs work by impairing [[mitosis]] ([[cell division]]), effectively targeting [[fast-dividing cells]]. As these drugs cause damage to cells, they are termed ''cytotoxic''. Some drugs cause cells to undergo [[apoptosis]] (so-called "self-programmed cell death").

Scientists have yet to identify specific features of malignant and immune cells that would make them uniquely targetable (barring some recent examples, such as the [[Philadelphia chromosome]] as targeted by [[imatinib]]). This means that other fast-dividing cells, such as those responsible for [[hair]] growth and for replacement of the [[intestine|intestinal]] [[epithelium]] (lining), are also often affected. However, some drugs have a better [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] profile than others, enabling [[physician|doctors]] to adjust treatment regimens to the advantage of patients in certain situations.

As chemotherapy affects cell division, tumors with high ''growth fractions'' (such as [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] and the aggressive [[lymphoma]]s, including [[Hodgkin's disease]]) are more sensitive to chemotherapy, as a larger proportion of the targeted cells are undergoing [[cell division]] at any time.  Malignancies with slower growth rates, such as indolent lymphomas, tend to respond to chemotherapy much more modestly.

Drugs affect "younger" tumors (i.e., more differentiated) more effectively, because mechanisms regulating cell growth are usually still preserved. With succeeding generations of tumor cells, differentiation is typically lost, growth becomes less regulated, and tumors become less responsive to most chemotherapeutic agents. Near the center of some solid tumors, cell division has effectively ceased, making them insensitive to chemotherapy. Another problem with solid tumors is the fact that the chemotherapeutic agent often does not reach the core of the tumor. Solutions to this problem include [[radiation therapy]] (both [[sealed source radiotherapy|brachytherapy]] and [[external beam radiotherapy|teletherapy]]) and [[surgery]].

Over time, cancer cells become more resistant to chemotherapy treatments.  Recently, scientists have identified small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside.  Research on [[p-glycoprotein]] and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing.  Medications to inhibit the function of [[p-glycoprotein]] are undergoing testing as of 2007 to enhance the [[wikt:efficacy|efficacy]] of chemotherapy.

==Treatment schemes==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}
There are a number of strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|palliate symptoms]].

''Combined modality chemotherapy'' is the use of drugs with other [[Cancer#Treatments|cancer treatments]], such as [[radiation therapy]] or [[surgery]]. Most cancers are now treated in this way. ''Combination chemotherapy'' is a similar practice that involves treating a patient with a number of different drugs simultaneously. The drugs differ in their mechanism and side effects. The biggest advantage is minimising the chances of resistance developing to any one agent.

In ''[[neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy'' (''preoperative'' treatment) initial chemotherapy is designed to shrink the primary tumor, thereby rendering local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) less destructive or more effective.

''[[Adjuvant chemotherapy]]'' (''postoperative'' treatment) can be used when there is little evidence of cancer present, but there is risk of recurrence. This can help reduce chances of relapse. It is also useful in killing any cancerous cells that have spread to other parts of the body. This is often effective as the newly growing tumours are fast-dividing, and therefore very susceptible.

''Palliative chemotherapy'' is given without curative intent, but simply to decrease tumor load and increase life expectancy. For these regimens, a better toxicity profile is generally expected.

All chemotherapy regimens require that the patient be capable of undergoing the treatment. [[Performance status]] is often used as a measure to determine whether a patient can receive chemotherapy, or whether dose reduction is required.  Because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment ([[fractional kill]]), repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.<ref name=skeel>{{cite book | last1=Skeel |first1= R.

==Types==
The majority of chemotherapeutic drugs can be divided into [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s, [[antimetabolite]]s, [[anthracycline]]s, plant [[alkaloid]]s, [[topoisomerase]] inhibitors, and other antitumour agents.<ref name=takimoto/> All of these drugs affect [[cell division]] or [[DNA]] synthesis and function in some way.

Some newer agents do not directly interfere with DNA. These include [[monoclonal antibodies]] and the new [[tyrosine kinase]] inhibitors, which directly target a molecular abnormality in certain types of cancer ([[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]s). These are examples of [[targeted therapy|targeted therapies]].

In addition, some drugs that modulate tumor cell behaviour without directly attacking those cells may be used.  Hormone treatments fall into this category.

===Alkylating agents===
{{Main|Alkylating antineoplastic agent}}

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to alkylate many [[nucleophilic]] functional groups under conditions present in cells. [[Cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]], as well as [[oxaliplatin]], are alkylating agents. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules.<ref name=takimoto>Takimoto CH, Calvo E. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 "Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref>

Other agents are [[mechlorethamine]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[chlorambucil]], [[ifosfamide]].<ref name=takimoto/> They work by chemically modifying a cell's DNA.

===Anti-metabolites===
{{Main|Antimetabolite}}

[[Anti-metabolite]]s masquerade as [[purine]]s (azathioprine, [[mercaptopurine]]) or [[pyrimidine]]s—which become the building-blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances from becoming incorporated into DNA during the "S" phase (of the [[cell cycle]]), stopping normal development and division. They also affect RNA synthesis. Due to their efficiency, these drugs are the most widely used cytostatics.

=== Plant alkaloids and terpenoids ===
These [[alkaloid]]s are derived from [[plant]]s and block cell division by preventing [[microtubule]] function. Microtubules are vital for cell division, and, without them, cell division cannot occur.  The main examples are [[vinca alkaloid]]s and [[taxane]]s.

==== Vinca alkaloids ====
Vinca alkaloids bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules ([[M phase]] of the [[cell cycle]]). They are derived from the [[Madagascar periwinkle]], ''Catharanthus roseus'' (formerly known as ''Vinca rosea''). The vinca alkaloids include:
* [[Vincristine]]
* [[Vinblastine]]
* [[Vinorelbine]]
* [[Vindesine]]

==== Podophyllotoxin ====
[[Podophyllotoxin]] is a plant-derived compound that is said to help with digestion as well as used to produce two other cytostatic drugs, [[etoposide]] and [[teniposide]]. They prevent the cell from entering the [[G1 phase]] (the start of DNA replication) and the replication of DNA (the [[S phase]]). The exact mechanism of its action is not yet known.

The substance has been primarily obtained from the [[American Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum peltatum''). Recently it has been discovered that a rare [[Himalayan Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum hexandrum'') contains it in a much greater quantity, but, as the plant is endangered, its supply is limited. Studies have been conducted to isolate the genes involved in the substance's production, so that it could be obtained [[genetic engineering|recombinantly]].

==== Taxanes ====
The prototype taxane is the [[natural product]] [[paclitaxel]], originally known as [[Taxol]] and first
derived from the bark of the [[Pacific Yew]] tree. [[Docetaxel]] is a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel.  Taxanes enhance stability of microtubules, preventing the separation of [[chromosome]]s during [[anaphase]].

===Topoisomerase inhibitors===
[[Topoisomerase]]s are essential [[enzyme]]s that maintain the [[topology]] of DNA.  Inhibition of type I or type II topoisomerases interferes with both [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication|replication]] of DNA by upsetting proper DNA [[supercoil]]ing.

* Some type I topoisomerase inhibitors include ''camptothecins'': [[irinotecan]] and [[topotecan]].

* Examples of type II inhibitors include [[amsacrine]], [[etoposide]], [[etoposide phosphate]], and [[teniposide]]. These are semisynthetic derivatives of [[epipodophyllotoxin]]s, substances naturally occurring in the root of [[American Mayapple|American Mayapple (''Podophyllum peltatum'')]].

===Cytotoxic antibiotics===

These include:
* [[actinomycin]]
* [[anthracycline]]s
** [[doxorubicin]]
** [[daunorubicin]]
** [[valrubicin]]
** [[idarubicin]]
** [[epirubicin]], which also inhibit [[topoisomerase]] II
* other cytotoxic antibiotics
** [[bleomycin]]. Bleomycin acts in a unique way through [[oxidation]] of a DNA-bleomycin-Fe(II) complex and forming [[free radicals]], which induce damage and chromosomal aberrations.
** [[plicamycin]]
** [[mitomycin]]

==Newer and experimental approaches==
{{Main|Experimental cancer treatments}}

===Isolated infusion approaches===
[[Isolated limb perfusion]] (often used in [[melanoma]]), or isolated infusion of chemotherapy into the liver or the lung have been used to treat some tumours.  The main purpose of these approaches is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy to tumor sites without causing overwhelming ''systemic'' damage. These approaches can help control solitary or limited metastases, but they are by definition ''not'' systemic, and, therefore, do not treat distributed metastases or [[micrometastasis|micrometastases]].

===Targeted delivery mechanisms===
Specially targeted delivery vehicles aim to increase effective levels of chemotherapy for tumor cells while reducing effective levels for other cells. This should result in an increased tumor kill and/or reduced toxicity.

Specially targeted delivery vehicles have a differentially higher affinity for tumor cells by interacting with tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens.

In addition to their targeting component, they also carry a payload - whether this is a traditional chemotherapeutic agent, or a radioisotope, or an immune-stimulating factor. Specially targeted delivery vehicles vary in their stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells.  Reduced systemic toxicity means that they can also be used in sicker patients, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.

===Nanoparticles===
[[Nanoparticles]] have emerged as a useful vehicle for poorly soluble agents such as [[paclitaxel]].<ref name="pmid19554862">{{cite journal |author=Vines T, Faunce T |title=Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs |journal=J Law Med |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=822–45 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19554862 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Nanoparticles made of magnetic material can also be used to concentrate agents at tumour sites using an externally applied magnetic field.

===Electrochemotherapy===
{{main|Electrochemotherapy}}
Electrochemotherapy is the combined treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug is followed by application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.
Clinical electrochemotherapy has been successfully used for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors irrespective of their histological origin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heller R, Gilbert R, Jaroszeski MJ. |title= Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy |journal=Adv Drug Deliv Rev |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=119–129 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00067-2 |pmid=10837693 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Larkin JO, Collins CG, Aarons S, Tangney M, Whelan M, O’Reily S, Breathnach O, Soden DM, O’Sullivan GC |title=Electrochemotherapy - Aspects of preclinical development and early clinical experience |journal=Ann Surg |volume=245 |issue=3 |pages=469–479 |year=2007 |pmid=17435555 |doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000250419.36053.33 |pmc=1877027}}</ref><ref name="Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O’Sullivan GC, Mir LM. 2006">{{cite journal |author=Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O’Sullivan GC, Mir LM |title=Electrochemotherapy - An easy, highly effective and safe treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases |pages=3–13 |journal=Eur J Cancer Suppl |volume=4 |issue=11 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.ejcsup.2006.08.002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sersa G, Miklavcic D, Cemazar M, Rudolf Z, Pucihar G, Snoj M. |title=Electrochemotherapy in treatment of tumours |journal=Eur J Surg Oncol |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=232–240 |year=2008 |pmid=17614247 |doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2007.05.016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Möller MG, Salwa S, Soden DM, O’Sullivan GC. |title=Electrochemotherapy as an adjunct or alternative to other treatments for unresectable or in-transit melanoma |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=9 |issue= 11 |pages=1611–1630 |year=2009 |doi=10.1586/era.09.129 |pmid=19895245 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Testori A, Tosti G, Martinoli C, Spadola G, Cataldo F, Verrecchia F, Baldini F, Mosconi M, Soteldo J, Tedeschi I, Passoni C, Pari C, Di Pietro A, Ferrucci PF |title=Electrochemotherapy for cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor lesions: a novel therapeutic approach |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=651–661 |year=2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2010.01370.x |pmid=21054709 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hampton T |title=Electric Pulses Help With Chemotherapy, May Open New Paths for Other Agents |journal=JAMA |volume=305 |issue=6 |pages=549–551 |year=2011 |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.92 |pmid= 21304073 }}</ref> The method has been reported as safe, simple and highly effective in all reports on clinical use of electrochemotherapy.

==Dosage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
Dosage of chemotherapy can be difficult: If the dose is too low, it will be ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity (side-effects, [[neutropenia]]) will be intolerable to the patient. This has led to the formation of detailed "dosing schemes" in most hospitals, which give guidance on the correct dose and adjustment in case of toxicity. In immunotherapy, they are in principle used in smaller dosages than in the treatment of malignant diseases.

In most cases, the dose is adjusted for the patient's [[body surface area]], a measure that correlates with blood volume. The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a [[nomogram]], using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement.

==Delivery==
[[File:Cyclophosphamide iv.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Cyclophosphamide]] IV drip]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
Most chemotherapy is [[Route of administration|delivered]] [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]], although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g., [[melphalan]], [[busulfan]], [[capecitabine]]). In some cases, [[isolated limb perfusion]] (often used in [[melanoma]]), or isolated infusion of chemotherapy into the liver or the lung have been used.  The main purpose of these approaches is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy to tumour sites without causing overwhelming systemic damage.

Depending on the patient, the cancer, the stage of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, intravenous chemotherapy may be given on either an [[inpatient]] or an [[outpatient]] basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access. Commonly used systems are the [[Hickman line]], the [[Port-a-Cath]], and the [[PICC line]]. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to [[phlebitis]] or [[extravasation]], and abolish the need for repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae.

Harmful and lethal toxicity from chemotherapy limits the dosage of chemotherapy that can be given. Some tumors can be destroyed by sufficiently high doses of chemotherapeutic agents.  However, these high doses cannot be given because they would be fatal to the patient.

==Adverse effects==

[[Chemotherapeutic]] techniques have a range of side-effects that depend on the type of medications used. The most common medications affect mainly the [[fast-dividing cells]] of the body, such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Common [[adverse effect|side-effects]] include:<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MBC/content/MBC_2_2X_What_Are_Common_Side_Effects.asp?sitearea=MBC What are Common Side Effects?] from the [[American Cancer Society]]</ref>

* Depression of the [[immune system]], which can result in potentially fatal [[infection]]s such as [[typhlitis]]. Although patients are encouraged to wash their hands, avoid sick people, and take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the patient's own [[gastrointestinal tract]] (including [[oral cavity]]) and skin.<ref name="internal_medicine_a05">{{Cite book  | last1 = Huang | first1 = Elbert S. | title = Internal medicine: handbook for clinicians, resident survival guide | year = 2000 | publisher = Scrub Hill Press | location = Arlington, VA  | isbn = 978-0-9645467-5-2 | page = 130}}</ref>  This may manifest as systemic infections, such as [[sepsis]], or as localized outbreaks, such as [[Herpes simplex]], [[shingles]], or other members of the [[human herpes virus|Herpesviridea]].<ref name="HSV">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, ''et al.'' |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993–1006 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3}}</ref> Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level.
* [[Cancer-related fatigue|Fatigue]].  The treatment can be physically exhausting for the patient, who might already be very tired from cancer-related fatigue.  It may produce mild to severe [[anemia]].  Treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production ([[erythropoietin]]), [[iron supplement]]s, and [[blood transfusion]]s.
* Tendency to bleed easily.  Medications that kill rapidly dividing cells or blood cells are likely to reduce the number of [[platelet]]s in the blood, which can result in [[Hematoma|bruises]] and [[Hemorrhage|bleeding]]. Extremely low platelet counts may be temporarily boosted through [[platelet transfusion]]s.  Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed to allow platelet counts to recover.
* Gastrointestinal distress.  [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are common side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells.  This can also produce [[diarrhea]] or [[constipation]].  [[Malnutrition]] and [[dehydration]] can result when the patient does not eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage.  This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much in an effort to allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications.  These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with [[antiemetic]] drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or [[Ginger#Medicinal use|ginger]] tea, are often recommended.  This is generally a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment.  However a high index of suspicion is appropriate, since [[diarrhea]] and bloating are also symptoms of [[typhlitis]], a very serious and potentially life-threatening [[medical emergency]] which requires immediate treatment.    
* [[Alopecia|Hair loss]].  Some medications that kill rapidly dividing cells cause dramatic hair loss; other medications may cause hair to thin.  These are most often temporary effects: hair usually starts to regrow a few weeks after the last treatment, sometimes with a tendency to curl, resulting in "chemo curls." Permanent hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens. [[Hypothermia cap|Scalp cooling]] offers a means of preventing both permanent and temporary hair loss.

Damage to specific organs is possible:
* [[Cardiotoxicity]] (heart damage)
* [[Hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage)
* [[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage)
* [[Ototoxicity]] (damage to the inner ear), producing [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]
* [[Encephalopathy]] (brain dysfunction)

===Immunosuppression and myelosuppression===
Virtually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the [[immune system]], often by paralysing the [[bone marrow]] and leading to a decrease of [[white blood cell]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s.
[[Anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]], when they occur, are improved with [[blood transfusion]]. [[Neutropenia]] (a decrease of the [[neutrophil granulocyte]] count below 0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/[[litre]]) can be improved with synthetic [[G-CSF]] ([[granulocyte]]-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., [[filgrastim]], [[lenograstim]]).

In very severe [[myelosuppression]], which occurs in some regimens, almost all the bone marrow [[stem cell]]s (cells that produce [[white blood cells|white]] and [[red blood cell]]s) are destroyed, meaning ''allogenic'' or ''[[autologous]]'' [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow cell transplants]] are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in ''allogenic'' BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.

In [[Japan]], the government has approved the use of some [[medicinal mushrooms]] like ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'', to counteract depression of the immune system in patients undergoing chemotherapy.<ref name="psk">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Coriolous_Versicolor.asp |title=Coriolus Versicolor |publisher=Cancer.org |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref>

===Typhlitis===
Due to immune system suppression, [[typhlitis]] is a "life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy."<ref>PMID 16319675</ref>  [[Typhlitis]] is an intestinal infection which may manifest itself through symptoms including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], a [[distended abdomen]], [[fever]], [[chills]], or [[abdominal pain|abdominal pain and tenderness]].  

[[Typhlitis]] is a [[medical emergency]].  It has a very poor [[prognosis]] and is often fatal unless promptly recognized and aggressively treated.<ref name="Keidan 1989 206–9">{{cite journal|last=Keidan|first=RD|coauthors=Fanning, Gatenby, Weese|title=Recurrent typhlitis.

=== Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) ===
{{Further|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting}}
[[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related side-effects for cancer patients and their families. In 1983, Coates et al. found that patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first- and second-most-severe side-effects, respectively. Up to 20% of patients receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed, or even refused, potentially curative treatments.<ref>{{cite journal

 | quote = Nausea and vomiting are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related side effects for cancer patients and their families.
 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}</ref>  Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common with many treatments and some forms of cancer.  Since the 1990s, several novel classes of [[antiemetics]] have been developed and commercialized, becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens, and helping to successfully manage these symptoms in a large portion of patients.  Effective mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes-crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient and more efficient treatment cycles, due to less stoppage of treatment due to better tolerance by the patient, and due to better overall health of the patient.

===Secondary neoplasm===
Development of secondary neoplasia after successful chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment can occur.  The most common [[secondary neoplasm]] is secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors.<ref>U. Rüther, C. Nunnensiek, H.-J. Schmoll,''Secondary Neoplasias following Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, and Immunosuppression'',Contributions to Oncology (Beiträge zur Onkologie); Vol 55, 2000, ISBN 3-8055-7116-X</ref>  Survivors of [[childhood cancer]] are more than 13 times as likely to get a [[secondary neoplasm]] during the 30 years after treatment than the general population.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.11.1207 | last1 = Hijiya | first1 = N | last2 = Hudson | first2 = MM | last3 = Lensing | first3 = S | year = 2007 | last4 = Zacher | first4 = M | last5 = Onciu | first5 = M | last6 = Behm | first6 = FG | last7 = Razzouk | first7 = BI | last8 = Ribeiro | first8 = RC | last9 = Rubnitz | first9 = JE | title = Cumulative Incidence of Secondary Neoplasms as a First Event After Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 11| pages = 1207–1215 | pmid = 17374815 | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}</ref>  Not all of this increase can be attributed to chemotherapy.

===Infertility===
Some types of chemotherapy are gonadotoxic and may cause [[infertility]].<ref name=Brydoy>{{cite journal |author=Brydøy M, Fosså SD, Dahl O, Bjøro T |title=Gonadal dysfunction and fertility problems in cancer survivors |journal=Acta Oncol |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=480–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17497315 |doi=10.1080/02841860601166958 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841860601166958}}</ref> Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine.<ref name=Brydoy/> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin.<ref name=Brydoy/> On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.<ref name=Brydoy/>

[[Female infertility]] by chemotherapy appears to be secondary to [[premature ovarian failure]] by loss of [[primordial follicles]].<ref name=Morgan2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms022}}</ref> This loss is not necessarily a direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents, but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.<ref name=Morgan2012/>

Patients may choose between several methods of [[fertility preservation]] prior to chemotherapy, including [[cryopreservation]] of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gurgan T, Salman C, Demirol A |title=Pregnancy and assisted reproduction techniques in men and women after cancer treatment |journal=Placenta |volume=29 Suppl  B |issue= |pages=152–9 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18790328 |doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2008.07.007 |url=}}</ref>  As more than half of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients.

===Teratogenicity===
Chemotherapy is potentially [[teratogenic]] during [[pregnancy]], especially during the [[first trimester]], to the extent that [[abortion]] usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy.<ref name=arnon2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/7.4.394}} [http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf]</ref> Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and adverse effects on cognitive development, but it may increase the risk of various [[complications of pregnancy]] and fetal myelosuppression.<ref name=arnon2011/> 

In males previously having undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy.<ref name=arnon2011/> The use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[micromanipulation technique]]s might increase this risk.<ref name=arnon2011/> In females previously having undergone chemotherapy, miscarriage and congenital malformations are not increased in subsequent conceptions.<ref name=arnon2011/> However, when [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[embryo cryopreservation]] is practised between or shortly after treatment, possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist, and hence it has been recommended that the babies be screened.<ref name=arnon2011/>

===Neurological adverse effects===
Reported are cytotoxic-induced [[neuropathy]] causing [[pain]]<ref name="dental_pain">{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Vainstein V, Heling I, ''et al.'' |title=Cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced odontalgia: a differential diagnosis for dental pain |journal=J Endod |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=1588–92 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20728733 |url=http://www.jendodon.com/article/S0099-2399(10)00458-9/abstract |doi=10.1016/j.joen.2010.05.004}}</ref> or [[paralysis]]. Some patients report fatigue or non-specific neurocognitive problems, such as an inability to concentrate; this is sometimes called [[post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment]], referred to as "chemo brain" by patients' groups.<ref name="pmid15169812">{{cite journal |author=Tannock IF, Ahles TA, Ganz PA, Van Dam FS |title=Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy for cancer: report of a workshop |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=2233–9 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15169812 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2004.08.094 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15169812}}</ref>

===Other side effects===
In particularly large tumors, such as large [[lymphoma]]s, some patients develop [[tumor lysis syndrome]] from the rapid breakdown of malignant cells. Although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in patients with large tumors, this is a dangerous side-effect that can lead to death if left untreated.

Less common side-effects include red skin ([[erythema]]), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]), [[water retention]], and [[sexual impotence]].  Some medications can trigger [[allergic]] or [[pseudoallergic]] reactions.

Specific chemotherapeutic agents are associated with organ-specific toxicities, including [[cardiovascular disease]] (e.g., [[doxorubicin]]), [[interstitial lung disease]] (e.g., [[bleomycin]]) and occasionally [[secondary neoplasm]] (e.g., [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]] therapy for Hodgkin's disease).

==Limitations==
Chemotherapy does not always work, and even when it is useful, it may not completely destroy the cancer.  Patients frequently fail to understand its limitations.  In one study of patients who had been newly diagnosed with incurable, stage 4 cancer, more than two-thirds of patients with lung cancer and more than four-fifths of patients with colorectal cancer still believed that chemotherapy was likely to cure their cancer.<ref name=Weeks>{{cite journal |author=Weeks JC, Catalano PJ, Cronin A, ''et al.'' |title=Patients' expectations about effects of chemotherapy for advanced cancer |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=367 |issue=17 |pages=1616–25 |year=2012 |month=October |pmid=23094723 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1204410 |url=}}</ref>

==Occupational precautions==
Healthcare workers exposed to antineoplastic agents take precautions to keep their exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse, since pharmacists that prepare these drugs or nurses that may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs during the course of their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/antineoplastic/|title=NIOSH Occupational Exposure to Antineoplastic Agents |accessdate=2007-10-10|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref>

==In other animals==
Chemotherapy is used in veterinary medicine similar to in human medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McKnight JA |title=Principles of chemotherapy |journal=Clin Tech Small Anim Pract |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=67–72 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12831063 |doi= 10.1053/svms.2003.36617|url=}}</ref>
