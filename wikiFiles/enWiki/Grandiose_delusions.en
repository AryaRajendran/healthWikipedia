[[File:Grandiose delusions cat lion.pdf|thumb|right|Patients suffering from grandiose delusions wrongly hold themselves at an extraordinary high status in their mind.]]
'''Grandiose delusions'''  (GD) or '''delusions of grandeur''' is principally a subtype of [[delusional disorder]] that occurs in patients suffering from a wide range of mental illnesses, including two-thirds of patients in [[mania|manic]] state of [[Current diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder|bipolar disorder]], half of those with [[schizophrenia]] and a substantial portion of those with substance abuse disorders.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref><ref name=Knowles/> GDs are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, [[omnipotent]], wealthy, or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic and typically have a [[supernatural]], [[science-fiction]]al, or religious theme. There is a relative lack of research into GD, in comparison to persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations. About 10% of healthy people experience<!--at any given time, or at some point in their lives?--> grandiose thoughts but do not meet full criteria for a diagnosis of GD.<ref name=Knowles/>

==Prevalence==
Research suggests that the severity of the delusions of grandeur is directly related to a higher self-esteem in individuals and inversely related to any individual’s severity of depression and negative self-evaluations.<ref name="smith et al">{{cite journal|last=Smith, N. et al.|title=Emotion and psychosis: Links between depression, self-esteem, negative schematic beliefs and delusions and hallucinations|journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]]|year=2006|volume=86|issue=1|pages=181–188}}</ref> Lucas ''et al.'' found that there is no significant gender difference in the establishment of grandiose delusion. However, there is a claim that ‘the particular component of Grandiose delusion’ may be variable across both genders.<ref name=Knowles/> Also, it had been noted that the presence of GDs in people with at least grammar or high school education was greater than lesser educated persons. Similarly, the presence of grandiose delusions in individuals who are the eldest is greater than in individuals who are the youngest of their siblings.<ref name="lucas et al 1962">{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=C.J.|coauthors=et al|title=A social and clinical study of delusions in schizophrenia|journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry|The Journal of Mental Science]]|year=1962|volume=108|page=747}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
According to the [[DSM-IV-TR]] diagnostic criteria for delusional disorder, grandiose type symptoms include grossly [[exaggerated]] belief of:
* self-worth
* power<ref name="Nelson2005">{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=H.E.|title=Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy with Delusions and Hallucinations: A Practice Manual|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VfF6Qq4yxEMC|accessdate=5 August 2012|year=2005|page=339|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780748792566}}</ref>
* knowledge
* identity
* or exceptional relationship to a [[divinity]] or famous person.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sadock|first=B. J.|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|page=752|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ubG51n2NgfwC&dq=grandiose+delusions&source=gbs_navlinks_s|coauthors= Sadock V.A.}}</ref>
For example, if the patient has fictitious beliefs about one’s power or authority he or she may believe himself or herself to be the ruling monarch, deserving to be treated like royalty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=J.L.|title=Mental Health and Psychiatric Nursing: A Caring Approach|year=1991|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|location=Boston, MA|page=760|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ShKgSO8U3-QC&dq=grandeur+delusions&source=gbs_navlinks_s|coauthors=Janosik E.H.}}</ref>
There are substantial differences in the degree of grandiosity linked with grandiose delusions in different patients. Some patients could believe they are God, the Queen of England, the President's son, a famous rock star, and so on. Others are not as expansive and think they are skilled sports-persons or great inventors.<ref name= casey>{{cite book|last=Casey|first=P.R.|title=Fish's Clinical Psychopathology: Signs and Symptoms in Psychiatry|year=2007|publisher=RCPsych Publications|location=UK|page=138|url=http://www.books.google.ca/books?id=gHdQTZNkA9YC&dq=grandiose+delusions&source=gbs_navlinks_s|coauthors=Brendan K.}}.</ref>

===Expansive delusions===
Expansive delusions may be maintained by [[auditory hallucinations]], which advise the patient that they are significant, or [[confabulations]], when, for example, the patient gives a thorough description of their [[coronation]] or marriage to the king. Grandiose and expansive delusions may also be part of fantastic hallucinosis in which all forms of hallucinations occur.<ref name= casey/>

===Positive functions===
Grandiose delusions frequently serve a very positive function for the person of sustaining or increasing their [[self-esteem]]. As a result, it is important to consider what the consequences of removing the grandiose delusion are on self-esteem when trying to modify the grandiose delusion in therapy.<ref name="Nelson2005"/> In many instances of grandiosity it is suitable to go for a fractional rather than a total modification, which permits those elements of the delusion that are central for self-esteem to be preserved. For example, a man who believes he is a senior secret service agent gains a great sense of self-esteem and purpose from this belief, thus until this sense of self-esteem can be provided from elsewhere, it is best not to attempt modification.<ref name="Nelson2005"/>

==Accounts of delusion==
There are two alternative accounts for getting grandiose delusions:<ref name=smith>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=N.|coauthors=Freeman D., Kuipers E.|title=Grandiose Delusions: An Experimental Investigation of the Delusion as Defense|journal=[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]|year=2005|volume=193|issue=7|pages=480–487|pmid=15985843}}</ref>

*Delusion-as-defense account: defense of the mind against lower self-esteem and depression
*Emotion-consistent account: result of exaggerated emotions.

==Epidemiology==
In researching over 1000 individuals of vast backgrounds, Stompe and colleagues (2006) found that grandiosity remains as the second most common delusion after persecutory delusions.<ref name=Knowles>{{Cite journal | last = Knowles | first = R. | coauthors =McCarthy-Jones S., Rowse G.| year = 2011 | title = Grandiose delusions: A review and theoretical integration of cognitive and affective perspectives | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 684–696 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.02.009}}</ref> A variation in the occurrence of grandiosity delusions in schizophrenic patients across cultures has also been observed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stompe|first=T. et al.|title=Paranoid-hallucinatory syndromes in schizophrenia results of the international study on psychotic symptoms|journal=World Cultural Psychiatry Review|year=2007|pages=63–68}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Suhail|first=K.|title=Phenomenology of delusions in Pakistani patients: effect of gender and social class|journal=[[Psychopathology]]|year=2003|volume=36|pages=195–199}}</ref> In research done by Appelbaum ''et al.'' it has been found that GDs appeared more commonly in patients with bipolar disorder (59%) than in patients with schizophrenia (49%), followed by presence in substance misuse disorder patients (30%) and depressed patients (21%).<ref name=Knowles/>

A relationship has been claimed between the age of onset of bipolar disorder and the occurrence of GDs. According to Carlson ''et al.'' (2000), grandiose delusions appeared in 74% of the patients who were 21 or lower at the time of the onset, while they occurred only in 40% of individuals 30 years or older at the time of the onset.<ref name=Knowles/>

==Comorbidity==

===Schizophrenia===
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder distinguished by a loss of contact with reality and the occurrence of [[psychotic]] behaviors, including [[hallucinations]] and delusions (unreal beliefs which endure even when there is contrary evidence).<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=Magill's Encyclopedia of Social Science: Psychology|year=2003|publisher=Salem Press, Inc|location=California|pages=718–719}}</ref> Delusions may include the false and constant idea that the person is being followed or poisoned, or that the person’s thoughts are being broadcast for others to listen to. Delusions in schizophrenia often develop as a response to the individual attempting to explain their hallucinations.<ref name=encyclopedia /> Patients who experience recurrent auditory hallucinations can develop the delusion that other people are scheming against them and are dishonest when they say they do not hear the voices that the delusioned person argues to hear.<ref name=encyclopedia />

Specifically, grandiose delusions are frequently found predominantly in [[paranoid schizophrenia]], in which a person has an extremely exaggerated sense of his or her significance, personality, knowledge, or authority. For example, the person may possibly declare to own IBM and kindly offer to write a hospital staff member a check for $5 million if they would only help them escape from the hospital.<ref>{{cite book|last=Noll|first=R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders|year=2009|publisher=Facts on File, Inc|location=New York|page=122|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA122&lpg=PA122&dq=grandiose+delusions+and+schizophrenia&source=bl&ots=eRDPuHUPb7&sig=Zflu3y_FBxVxIpAWVemEXxPmZRs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VNYOUPm7K8OYqAGV1ICACg&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=grandiose%20delusions%20and%20schizophrenia&f=false}}</ref> Other common grandiose delusions in schizophrenia include religious delusions such as the belief that one is Jesus Christ.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hunsley|first=J.|title=A Guide to Assessment that Work|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=676|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bmilrEoRSf0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|coauthors=Mash E.J. }}</ref> A 2012 paper suggested that psychiatric conditions associated with psychotic  spectrum symptoms, that may include grandiose delusions, may be possible explanations for revelatory driven experiences and activities such as those of [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and [[Saint Paul]].<ref>Murray, ED.; Cunningham MG, Price BH.

===Bipolar disorder===
{{Main|Bipolar disorder}}
Bipolar disorder is severe affective dysregulation, or mood states that sway from exceedingly low (depression) to exceptionally high ([[mania]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Barlow|first=D.H.|title=Clinical Handbook of Psychological Disorders: A Step by Step Treatment Manual|year=2007|publisher=Guilford |location=New York|page=722|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=JSfnCPlEFygC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Bipolar patients with grandiose delusions are essentially high on themselves. If they convey any feelings of aggravation at all, these at most characterize secondary anxiety that others will be jealous of them and hold them back from getting what they are entitled to, or seize what they already have.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kantor|first=M.|title=Understanding Paranioa: A Guide for Professionals, Families, and Sufferers|year=2004|publisher=Greenwoord |location=West Port|page=252|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=9ia6zITbOnMC&dq=grandiose+delusions+and+bipolar&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>
 
Bipolar patients experience delusion during the worse part of their illness. Typically, when experiencing or displaying a stage of heightened excitability, joy, rage, senselessness, and correlated phenomena they might convey thoughts or beliefs that are grandiose in nature. Some of these grandiose beliefs frequently involve thoughts that the patient is very rich or famous or has super human abilities, etc.<ref>{{cite book|last=Isaac|first=G.|title=Bipolar Not Adhd: Unrecognized Epidemic of Manic Depressive Illness in Children|year=2001|publisher=Writers Club Press|location=Lincoln|page=184|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=3Qt6vKFA3DcC&dq=grandiose+delusions+and+bipolar&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> In the most severe form, known as psychotic mania, the bipolar patient may hear voices and have grandiose delusions such as "I am the King of England".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fieve|first=R.

==Anatomical aspects==
Grandiose delusions are frequently and almost certainly related to lesions of the [[frontal lobe]]. [[Temporal lobe]] lesions have been mainly reported in patients with [[delusions of persecution]] and of remorse, while frontal and frontotemporal involvement have been described in patients with grandiose delusions, [[Cotard’s syndrome]], and [[delusional misidentification syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tonkonogy|first=Joseph M.|title=Localization of Clinical Syndromes in Neuropsychology and Neuroscience|year=2009|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York, NY|page=846|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=t2Y4gv9d3l0C&dq=frontal+lobe+lesion+grandiose+delusions&source=gbs_navlinks_s|coauthors=Tonkonogiĭ T.M., Puente A.E.}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Patients suffering from [[schizophrenia]], grandiose and religious delusions are found to be the least susceptible to cognitive behavioral interventions.<ref name=appel /> Cognitive behavioral intervention is a form of psychological therapy, initially used for [[Depression (mood)|depression]],<ref name=beck>{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=A.T.|coauthors=Rush A.J., Shaw B.F., Emergy G|title=Cognitive Therapy of Depression|journal=New York, NY. Guilford Press|year=1979}}</ref> but currently used for a variety of different mental disorders, in hope of providing relief from distress and disability.<ref name=salkovskis>{{cite book|last=Salkovskis|first=P.M.|title=Frontiers of Cognitive Therapy|year=1996|publisher=Guillford|location=New York}}</ref> During therapy, grandiose delusions were linked to patients' underlying beliefs by using inference chaining.<ref name=beck /><ref name=sensky>{{cite journal|last=Sensky|first=T.|coauthors=et al|title=A randomized controlled trial of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Persistent Symptoms in Schizophrenia resistant to medication|journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]]|year=2000|volume=57|pages=165–172|pmid=10665619|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.57.2.165}}</ref> Some examples of interventions performed to improve the patient's state were focus on specific themes, clarification of [[neologisms]], and thought linkage.<ref name=sensky /> During thought linkage, the patient is asked repeatedly by the therapist to explain his/her jumps in thought from one subject, to a completely different one.<ref name=sensky /> 

Patients suffering from mental disorders that experience grandiose delusions have been found to have a lower risk of having [[suicidal]] thoughts and attempts.<ref name=oquendo>{{cite journal|last=Oquendo|first=M.A.|coauthors=et al.|title=Suicidal behavior in bipolar mood disorder: clinical characteristics of attempters and nonattempters|journal=Journal of Affect Disorders|year=2000|volume=59|pages=107–117}}</ref>
