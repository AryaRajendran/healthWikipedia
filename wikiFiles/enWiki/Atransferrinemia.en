'''Atransferrinemia''', also called '''familial hypotransferrinemia''',<ref>{{OMIM|209300}}</ref> is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1862777 |year=1991 |month=August |author=Hamill, Rl; Woods, Jc; Cook, Ba |title=Congenital atransferrinemia. A case report and review of the literature |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=215–8 |issn=0002-9173 |journal=American journal of clinical pathology}}</ref> [[metabolic disorder]] in which there is an absence of [[transferrin]], a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[protein]] that transports [[iron]] through the [[blood]].

Atransferrinemia is characterized by [[anemia]] and [[hemosiderosis]] in the [[heart]] and [[liver]]. The iron damage to the heart can lead to [[heart failure]]. The anemia is typically [[microcytic anemia|microcytic]] and hypochromic (the [[red blood cell]]s are abnormally small and pale). Atransferrinemia is extremely rare, with only eight cases documented worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18097132 |year=2007 |author=Aslan, D; Crain, K; Beutler, E |title=A new case of human atransferrinemia with a previously undescribed mutation in the transferrin gene |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=244–7 |doi=10.1159/000112726 |journal=Acta haematologica}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Severe microcytic hypochromic anemia, growth retardation and recurrent [[infection]]s are the first clinical signs of the disease. Iron overload occurs mainly in the liver, heart, [[pancreas]], [[thyroid]], [[kidney]] and [[Joint|bone joints]], leading to mild to severe symptoms of [[Liver failure|liver]] and heart failure, [[arthropathy]] and [[hypothyroidism]]. Death may occur due to heart failure or [[pneumonia]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Genetics==
[[File:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Atransferrinemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]], meaning both copies of the gene in each cell are defective.]]

A [[case study]] was done in [[1961 in science|1961]] on a 7-year-old [[girl]] who died of heart failure with atransferrinemia. The half-normal levels of transferrin in her [[parent]]s' bloodstream supported the notion that this disorder is transferred in an [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[Recessive gene|recessive]] pattern.<ref>{{cite journal |language=German |pmid=13906010 |year=1961 |month=September |author=Heilmeyer, L; Keller, W; Vivell, O; Keiderling, W; Betke, K; Woehler, F; Schultze, He |title=Congenital atransferrinemia in a 7-year-old girl |volume=86 |issue= 37|pages=1745–51 |issn=0012-0472 |journal=[[Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift]]|year=1946 |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/childrenspage.html |format=Free full text |doi=10.1055/s-0028-1113001}}</ref> Atransferrinemia was reported in only eight patients in six families as of the year 2000. A lack of scientific data and [[public outreach]], however, have suggested that there is a higher number of current cases. Researchers used the first known case reported in the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11110675 |date=15 December 2000|author=Beutler, E; Gelbart, T; Lee, P; Trevino, R; Fernandez, Ma; Fairbanks, Vf |title=Molecular characterization of a case of atransferrinemia |volume=96 |issue=13 |pages=4071–4 |issn=0006-4971 |journal=Blood |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11110675 |format=Free full text }}</ref> and identified [[mutation]]s in the TF gene as a probable cause of the disorder.

==Treatment==
Treatment with infusions of plasma or purified apotransferrin may stabilise or correct the [[anemia]] and growth defects.
