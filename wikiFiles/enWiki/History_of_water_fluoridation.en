{{Main|Water fluoridation}}

The '''history of water fluoridation''' can be divided into three periods. The first ({{circa}} 1901–33) was research into the cause of a form of mottled [[tooth enamel]] called the Colorado Brown Stain, which later became known as fluorosis. The second (c. 1933–45) focused on the relationship among fluoride concentrations, fluorosis, and [[Dental caries|tooth decay]]. The third period, from 1945 on, focused on [[water fluoridation]], which added fluoride to community water supplies.<ref name=Ripa>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1752-7325.1993.tb02666.x |author= Ripa LW |title= A half-century of community water fluoridation in the United States: review and commentary |journal= J Public Health Dent |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=17–44 |year=1993 |pmid=8474047 |url=http://aaphd.org/docs/position%20papers/A%20Half-Century%20of%20Community%20Water1993.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref>

In the first half of the 19th century, investigators established that fluoride occurs with varying concentrations in teeth, bone, and drinking water. In the second half they speculated that fluoride would protect against tooth decay, proposed supplementing the diet with fluoride, and observed mottled enamel (now called severe [[dental fluorosis]]) without knowing the cause.<ref>{{cite book |chapter= Fluorine and dental caries |author= Cox GJ |pages=325–414 |title= A Survey of the Literature of Dental Caries |editor= Toverud G, Finn SB, Cox GJ, Bodecker CF, Shaw JH (eds.) |publisher= National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council |location= Washington, DC |oclc=14681626 |year=1952}} Publication 225.</ref> In 1874, the German public health officer Carl Erhardt recommended [[potassium fluoride]] supplements to preserve teeth.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Eckardt [sic] |title= Kali fluoratum zur Erhaltung der Zähne |language=German |journal= Der praktische Arzt |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=69–70 |year=1874}} A followup was translated into English in: {{cite journal |author= Friedrich EG (reporter) |title= Potassium fluoride as a caries preventive: a report published 80 years ago |journal= J Am Dent Assoc |volume=49 |year=1954 |page=385}}</ref> In 1892 the British physician [[James Crichton-Browne]] noted in an address that fluoride's absence from diets had resulted in teeth that were "peculiarly liable to decay", and who proposed "the reintroduction into our diet ... of fluorine in some suitable natural form ... to fortify the teeth of the next generation".<ref>{{cite journal |author= Crichton-Browne J |title= An address on tooth culture |journal=Lancet |volume=140 |issue=3592 |pages=6–10 |year=1892 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)97399-4}}</ref>

Community water fluoridation in the [[United States]] is partly due to the research of Dr. Frederick McKay, who pressed the dental community for an investigation into what was then known as "Colorado Brown Stain."<ref name="csdshistory">[http://www.cs-ds.org/history.asp#fluoride History of Dentistry in the Pikes Peak Region],[http://www.cs-ds.org/index.asp Colorado Springs Dental Society] webpage, page accessed 25 February 2006.</ref> The condition, now known as dental fluorosis, when in its severe form is characterized by cracking and pitting of the teeth.<ref>[http://www.nidr.nih.gov/dev/deleted_files/flouride.htm]</ref><ref>[http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=7&questionID=4858 McGraw-Hill's AccessScience<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5295412 Report Judges Allowable Fluoride Levels in Water : NPR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Fluoridation became an official policy of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Lennon MA |title= One in a million: the first community trial of water fluoridation |journal= Bull World Health Organ |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=759–60 |year=2006 |pmid=17128347 |doi=10.2471/BLT.05.028209 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0042-96862006000900020 |pmc= 2627472 }}</ref> By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.<ref name=US-WF-Stats-2006>{{cite web |author= Division of Oral Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC |title= Water fluoridation statistics for 2006 |url=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2006stats.htm |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref> In some other countries the pattern was similar. Fluoridation was introduced into Brazil in 1953, was regulated by federal law starting in 1974, and by 2004 was used by 71% of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Buzalaf MA, de Almeida BS, Olympio KPK, da S Cardoso VE, de CS Peres SH |title= Enamel fluorosis prevalence after a 7-year interruption in water fluoridation in Jaú, São Paulo, Brazil |journal= J Public Health Dent |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=205–8 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-7325.2004.tb02754.x |pmid=15562942}}</ref> In other locations, fluoridation was used and then discontinued; for example, in [[Kuopio]], Finland, fluoridation was used for decades but was discontinued because the school dental service provided significant fluoride programs and the cavity risk was low.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Mullen J |title= History of water fluoridation |journal= Br Dent J |volume=199 |issue= 7 Suppl |pages=1–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16215546 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4812863 |author2= European Association for Paediatric Dentistry}}</ref>

McKay's work had established that fluorosis occurred before [[tooth eruption]]. Dean and his colleagues assumed that fluoride's protection against cavities was also pre-eruptive, and this incorrect assumption was accepted for years. By 2000, however, the [[topical]] effects of fluoride (in both water and toothpaste) were well understood, and it had become known that a constant low level of fluoride in the mouth works best to prevent cavities.<ref>{{cite book |author= Burt BA, Tomar SL |chapter= Changing the face of America: water fluoridation and oral health |pages=307–22 |title= Silent Victories: The History and Practice of Public Health in Twentieth-century America |editor= Ward JW, Warren C |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-19-515069-4}}</ref>
