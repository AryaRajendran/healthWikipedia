'''Charles Herbert Best''', [[Order of Canada|CC]], [[Companion of Honour|CH]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Royal Society|FRS]],<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1982.0001}}</ref> [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]], [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]] (February 27, 1899 &ndash; March 31, 1978) was an [[American-Canadian]] medical scientist and one of the co-discoverers of [[insulin]].

==Biography==
Born in West Pembroke, [[Washington County, Maine|Washington County]], [[Maine]], he was the son of Luella Fisher and Herbert Huestis Best, Canadians from [[Nova Scotia]].

==Co-discovery of insulin==
Best moved to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] in 1915 where he started studying towards a bachelor of arts degree at [[University College, University of Toronto]]. In 1918, he enlisted in the Canadian Army serving with the 2nd Canadian Tank Battalion. After the war, he completed his degree in physiology and biochemistry.<ref name="UoTBio">{{cite web|url=http://www.utoronto.ca/bandb/best.htm|title=Charles Herbert Best|work=University of Toronto}}</ref>

As a 22-year-old medical student at the [[University of Toronto]] he worked as an assistant to Dr. [[Frederick Banting]]<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1942.0003}}</ref> and played a major role in the discovery of the pancreatic hormone [[insulin]]&mdash;one of the more significant medical advances, enabling an effective treatment for [[diabetes]]. In the spring of 1921, Banting travelled to Toronto to visit [[John James Rickard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]], professor of physiology at the University of Toronto, and asked Macleod if he could use his laboratory. Macleod was initially sceptical, but eventually agreed before leaving on holiday for the summer. Before leaving for Scotland he supplied Banting with ten dogs for experiment and two medical students, Charles Best and Clark Noble, as lab assistants.

Since Banting only required one assistant, Best and Noble flipped a coin to see which would assist Banting first. Best won and took the first shift. Loss of the coin toss proved unfortunate for Noble, given that Banting decided to keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half of his Nobel Prize money and a large part of the credit for the discovery of insulin. Had Noble won the toss his career might have taken a different path.<ref name="pmid12473641">{{cite journal | author = Wright JR | title = Almost famous: E. Clark Noble, the common thread in the discovery of insulin and vinblastine | journal = CMAJ | volume = 167 | issue = 12 | pages = 1391–6 | year = 2002 | month = December | pmid = 12473641 | pmc = 137361 | doi = | url = }}</ref> 

In 1923, the Nobel Prize Committee honoured Banting and [[John James Richard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]] with the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for the discovery of insulin, ignoring Charles Best. This incensed Banting who then chose to share half of the prize money with Best.

==Professor of physiology==
Best succeeded Macleod as professor of physiology at University of Toronto in 1929.  During [[World War II]] he was influential in establishing a Canadian program for securing and using dried human [[blood serum]]. In his later years, he was an adviser to the Medical Research Committee of the [[United Nations]] [[World Health Organization]].

Best married Margaret Hooper Mahon in Toronto in 1924 and they had two sons. One son, [[Dr. Henry Best]] was a well-regarded historian who later became president of [[Laurentian University]] in Sudbury, Ontario. Charles Best is interred in [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery]], Toronto.

==Awards and honours==
Best was elected a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1948.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=24 June 2011}}</ref> In 1967 he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]] in recognition for "his contribution to medicine, particularly as co-discoverer of insulin."<ref>{{Canadian honour|Type=orc|ID=1833|accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> He was a commander of the Civil Division of the [[Order of the British Empire]]<ref name="UoTBio"/> and was made a member of [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] in 1971 "for services to Medical Research."<ref>{{cite web|title=Supplement tp the London Gazette|work=[[London Gazette]]|date=June 12, 1971|url=http://www.gazette-online.co.uk/issues/45384/supplements/5978}}</ref> He was a fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]], the [[Royal Society of Canada]], and was the first Canadian to be elected into the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="UoTBio"/>

In 1994 he was inducted into the [[Canadian Medical Hall of Fame]]. In 2004, he was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].  

[[Dr. Charles Best Secondary School]] in [[Coquitlam, British Columbia]], C.H. Best West Elementary School in [[Burlington, Ontario]], and C.H. Best East Middle School in [[Toronto, Ontario]], are named in his honour.
