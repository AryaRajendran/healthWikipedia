'''Internal fixation''' is an [[Surgery|operation]] in [[orthopedics]] that involves the surgical implementation of [[Implant (medicine)|implants]] for the purpose of repairing a [[bone]], a concept that dates to the mid-19th century and was made applicable for routine treatment in the mid-20th century.<ref>T.

==Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF)==

'''Open Reduction Internal Fixation''' (ORIF) involves the implementation of implants to guide the healing process of a bone, as well as the open reduction, or setting, of the bone itself. ''Open [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]]'' refers to [[open surgery]] to set [[bone]]s, as is necessary for some [[fracture]]s. ''Internal fixation'' refers to fixation of screws and/or plates,  intramedullary bone nails ([[femur]], [[tibia]], [[humerus]]) to enable or facilitate [[healing]]. Rigid fixation prevents micro-motion across lines of fracture to enable healing and prevent infection, which happens when implants such as plates (e.g. [[dynamic compression plate]]) are used.  Open Reduction Internal Fixation techniques are often used in cases involving serious fractures such as [[Bone fracture|comminuted]] or displaced fractures or in cases where the bone would otherwise not heal correctly with casting or splinting alone. 

Risks and complications can include bacterial colonization of the bone, [[infection]], [[joint stiffness|stiffness and loss of range of motion]], non-union, mal-union, damage to the muscles, nerve damage and palsy, [[arthritis]], [[tendonitis]], chronic [[pain]] associated with plates, screws, and pins, [[compartment syndrome]], [[deformity]], audible popping and snapping, and possible future surgeries to remove the hardware.

==Closed Reduction Internal Fixation==
'''Closed Reduction Internal Fixation''' (CRIF) is [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]] without any open surgery, followed by internal fixation. It appears to be an acceptable alternative in unstable displaced lateral [[condylar fracture]]s of the [[humerus]] in children, but if fracture displacement after closed reduction exceeds 2 mm, open reduction and internal fixation is recommended.<ref>{{cite pmid|19047713}}</ref>
