'''Brittle asthma''' is a type of [[asthma]] distinguishable from other forms by recurrent, severe attacks.<ref name=H291>{{cite book | last = Holgate | first = Stephen T. | coauthors = Homer Anton.

Type 1 is characterized by sustained, chronic variability of PEFR, while type 2 is distinguished by sudden unpredictable drops in PEFR where asthma symptoms are otherwise well controlled and the function of the lungs is not substantially impaired.

Brittle asthma is one of the "unstable" subtypes of "difficult asthma", a term used to characterize the less than 5% of asthma cases that do not respond to maximal inhaled treatment, including high doses of [[corticosteroid]]s combined with additional therapies such as long-acting [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta-2 agonists]].<ref name=W1343>{{cite book | last = Warrell | first = David A. | title =  Oxford textbook of medicine: Sections 18-33 | volume = 3 | series = Oxford Medical Publications | edition = 4th | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-19-856978-5 | page = 1346}}</ref><ref name="pmid18441682">{{cite journal |author=Ogorodova LM, Selivanova PA, Gereng EA, Bogomiakov VS, Volkova LI, Pleshko RI |title=[Pathomorphological characteristics of unstable bronchial asthma (brittle phenotype)] |language=Russian |journal=Ter.

==Characteristics==
The 2005 ''[[Oxford Textbook of Medicine]]'' distinguishes type 1 brittle asthma by "persistent daily chaotic variability in peak flow (usually greater than 40 per cent diurnal variation in PEFR more than 50 per cent of the time)", while type 2 is identified by "sporadic sudden falls in PEFR against a background of usually well-controlled asthma with normal or near normal lung function".<ref name=W1347>Warrell, 1347.</ref> In both types, patients are subject to recurrent, severe attacks. The cardinal symptoms of an asthma attack are shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), [[wheeze|wheezing]], and chest tightness.<ref name=Mason>{{cite book | author = Saunders | chapter = Asthma | title = Mason: Murray & Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine (Homer A.

When first defined by Margaret Turner-Warwick in 1977, the term brittle asthma was used specifically to describe type 1, but as studies into the phenotype were conducted the second type was also distinguished.<ref>{{cite book | last = Waldron | first = Jill | title = Asthma Care in the Community | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-470-03000-3 | page= 122}}</ref> The condition is rare. 1999's ''Difficult Asthma'' estimates a prevalence of approximately .05% brittle asthma sufferers among the asthmatic population.<ref name=H293>Holgate et. al, 293.</ref> Though found in all ages, it is most commonly found in individuals between the ages of 18 and 55; it is present in both sexes, though type 1 has been diagnosed in three times as many women as men.<ref name=H293/> Hospitalization is more frequent for type 1 than type 2.<ref name=H293/>

==Treatment==
In addition to any issues of [[Compliance (medicine)|treatment compliance]], and maximised [[corticosteroid]]s (inhalled or oral) and [[beta agonist]],  brittle asthma treat also involves for type 1 additional subcutaneous injections of beta2 agonist and inhalation of [[long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist]],<ref name="pmid15636398">{{cite journal |author=Graziani E, Petroianni A, Terzano C |title=Brittle asthma |journal=Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=135–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15636398 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  whilst type 2 needs allergen avoidance and self-management approaches.<ref name="pmid17695694">{{cite journal |author=Toungoussova O, Foschino Barbaro MP, Esposito LM, ''et al.'' |title=Brittle asthma |journal=Monaldi Arch Chest Dis |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=102–5 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17695694 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Since catastrophic attacks are unpredictable in type 2, patients may display identification of the issue, such as a [[MedicAlert]] bracelet, and carry an [[epinephrine autoinjector]].<ref name=W1347/>
