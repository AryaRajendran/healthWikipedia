'''Boyd E. Haley''', (born September 22, 1940, [[Greensburg, Indiana]]), is a retired professor of  chemistry at the [[University of Kentucky]]. The basic research interest of his laboratory centered on [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[Biomedicine|biomedical]] problems involving control at the molecular level, particularly in biological systems regulated by protein–nucleotide interactions where the [[bioenergetics]] involved are expressed through site-specific [[nucleotide]] binding of high affinity or through protein substrate phosphorylation. He has also investigated the effect of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] on tissues and published on similarities between these and some biochemical changes reported in nerve cells in [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[autism]].  His views about mercury and dental amalgams go against the consensus held in the medical community.

== Research ==

Haley's [[University of Kentucky]] laboratory studies the differences between normal and diseased tissues as observed through changes in [[nucleotide]] binding proteins.  Haley focuses on biochemical and biomedical problems involving control at the molecular level, particularly biological systems regulated by protein–nucleotide interactions where the bioenergetics involved are expressed through site-specific nucleotide binding of high affinity or through protein substrate phosphorylation.

His lab synthesizes novel nucleotide analogs that are photoactive or fluorescent, or both, which are then used to study protein–nucleotide interactions which regulate enzyme activity.  These probes have proven useful in his research into the causes of Alzheimer's disease, [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[multiple sclerosis]], which his lab is currently investigating. 

His laboratory's approach to the study of the general phenomenon of protein–nucleotide interactions is to synthesize novel nucleotide analogs that are photoactive or fluorescent, or both. The analogs are then used to study various interactions which regulate enzyme activity. Analogs used may be modifications of the commonly known nucleotides such as [[Adenosine triphosphate]], [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]], [[Guanosine triphosphate]], [[dUTP diphosphatase]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]].

== Mercury research ==

Haley has testified to the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] regarding [[Mercury (metal)|mercury]] vapour from [[dental amalgam]]s and on [[thimerosal]]-containing [[vaccines]].  Haley was one of the first researchers to propose that [[thimerosal controversy|Thimerosal]] in vaccines was the most likely toxic agent involved in [[Gulf War syndrome]] and [[autism spectrum disorder]]s.  

Haley has conducted studies that suggest low levels of mercury are capable of contributing to certain neurological diseases such as [[autism]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], and he has observed that exposure of lab rats to low level mercury vapor causes a great increase in rat brain mercury levels, along with a marked decrease in brain [[tubulin]] photolabeling, as has been found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

Using birth-hair analysis, Haley has produced evidence that individuals diagnosed with [[autism]] excrete less mercury.  His hypothesis is that they form a distinct subset of the population with reduced excretion of [[Mercury (metal)|mercury]],<!-- is it in fact Mercury ions rather than organic compounds - if it were, and I have not time to look it up now, then a link there to Ethylmercury would be more appropriate - that is covalent not ionic--><ref>{{cite journal | author=Holmes AS, Blaxill MF, Haley BE | title=Reduced levels of mercury in first baby haircuts of autistic children | journal=Int J Toxicol | year=2003 | pages=277–285 | volume=22 | issue=4 | pmid= 12933322 | doi=10.1080/10915810305120}}</ref> relating to [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal's controversial and unproven role]] in the etiology of autism.

=== Controversial views about mercury and dental amalgams ===

Haley surmises that mercury released from dental [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]]s could be a potential cause of autism and Alzheimer’s disease.  His findings have not been reproduced and the [[United States Public Health Service]] and the [[American Dental Association]] reject these claims.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/consumer/amalgams.html | title = Questions and Answers on Dental Amalgam | date = 2006-10-30 | accessdate = 2008-01-04 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019060424/http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/consumer/amalgams.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/positions/statements/amalgam.asp | title = ADA Statement on Dental Amalgam | date = 2007-04-06 | accessdate = 2008-01-04 | publisher = [[American Dental Association]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011130327/http://ada.org/prof/resources/positions/statements/amalgam.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-11}}</ref> Haley's position is that there is a link between people with dental amalgams containing a high level of mercury and the level of mercury in the blood and urine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.toxicteeth.org/natCamp_ADAresponds_haleyrebuttal.cfm | title = Dr. Boyd Haley's Rebuttal to the ADA | date = 2001-05-23 | accessdate = 2008-01-04 | format = cfm | publisher = Toxicteeth.org | last = Haley | first = Boyd}}</ref> Critics of the anti-amalgam view have pointed to a study<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berdouses E, Vaidyanathan TK, Dastane A, Weisel C, Houpt M, Shey Z |title=Mercury release from dental amalgams: an in vitro study under controlled chewing and brushing in an artificial mouth |journal=J.

Different amalgam manufacturer's products were used.  These amalgams were allowed to age until the mercury release was constant.  The initial levels were many times the steady state levels as previously reported by others.  Amalgams were individually placed in sealed containers with 10 ml of distilled water at room temperature and the water was changed daily and mercury levels were determined daily using a mercury vapor analyzer.  The results showed that mercury emission from all of the amalgams was in the 4 to 20 micrograms/cm2/day and hundreds of times higher that that estimated by pro-amalgam researchers. The pro-amalgam reports on amalgam mercury release failed to do adequate control of the mercury vapor during their experiments or estimated total mercury release using urine mercury levels (which account for less than 10% of the mercury excreted by humans).  This new data showing the amount of mercury excreted by amalgams under tightly controlled conditions at room temperature without abrasion or exposure to hot liquids refutes the argument by the ADA and the USPHS that amalgams only emit non-toxic levels of mercury.  Haley's data is consistent with the high levels of mercury found in the fecal material of amalgam bearers (60 micrograms/day) versus amalgam free individuals.

This data and the results of an NIH study on Portuguese orphans showing that boys retain mercury from their amalgams much more than do girls has caused concern and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has changed its website in June 2008 from being supportive of amalgams to questioning their safety in certain cohort groups.  The FDA has opened up a comment period from the public that end July 28th and then the FDA will for the first time ever place amalgams in a classification group.  Amalgams, in spite of being known emitters of the toxic metal mercury has never been classified even though congress ordered the FDA to do this in 1976.  

Haley points out that the decrease in urinary mercury excretion in boys, but not observed in girls, corresponds to the time in life when boys start producing more testosterone.  He proposes that increased testosterone has an effect of increasing mercury retention that leads to illnesses such as autims, ADHD, PD-NOS which is much greater in boys than girls.  This is supported by findings that the amniotic fluid of mothers who give birth to neurologically ill children is routinely high in testosterone and, with neurons in culture, testosterone greatly enhances thimerosal and mercury induced lethality whereas estrogen displays a protective effect. -->

=== Mercury and gold salts ===

Haley has speculated that [[gold salts]] may induce a wide range of improvements in overall health, in a manner similar to that of [[chelation therapy]].  Haley has also speculated that gold salts may be useful in the treatment of autism.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.upi.com/Consumer_Health_Daily/Reports/2005/12/30/the_age_of_autism_gold_standards/2870/ | title = The Age of Autism: Gold standards | publisher = [[United Press International]] | date = 2005-12-30 | accessdate = 2008-01-04 | last = Olmsted | first = Dan }}</ref> This was based on the observation that one of the first autistics known lost his autism diagnosis when treated for rheumatoid arthritis by taking gold salts containing a thiol linkage.  Gold and thiols are known to have high affinity for mercury.

== Professional associations ==

Haley is also co-founder and scientific advisor of Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc., a [[biotechnology]] firm that synthesizes and markets [[nucleotide]] photo-affinity analogs for biomedical research.

Dr. Haley is a member of the Autism Think Tank of the Autism Association, and a fellow in the IAOMT and has presented numerous lectures on the subject of mercury toxicity and neurological diseases at a variety of international conferences, and has testified before congressional committees and the Institute of Medicine.

Haley is the founder of CTI Science, a [[Lexington, Kentucky]]-based bio-technology firm. CTI marketed a product [[BDTH2|OSR#1]] for human consumption, described as an "antioxidant" [[dietary supplement]], that is known to be a powerful [[Chelation therapy|chelator]] from a family of [[chelator]]s originally developed to remove [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s from soil and acid mine drainage.<ref name=Trib>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-chemicaljan17,0,6466364.story "OSR#1: Industrial chemical or autism treatment?"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', January 17, 2010</ref> In June 2008, an FDA toxicologist questioned<ref>[http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/contentStreamer?objectId=09000064806d97e6&disposition=attachment&contentType=pdf FDA letters and documents]</ref> "on what basis the product could be expected to be safe and could be considered a dietary ingredient", but CTI Science and Haley had not responded as of January 2010.<ref name=Trib/>  The question was, however, in response to a 75 day premarket notification for a supplement which precluded testing on humans until after its submission. The testing was described by Ellen Silbergeld of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Bloomberg School of Public Health]] as incomplete and indicative of toxicity.<ref>{{cite news |title= FDA warns maker of autism supplement |url= http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2010/06/24/FDA-warns-maker-of-autism-supplement/UPI-44231277415294/ |agency= UPI |date= June 24, 2010 |accessdate= September 12, 2011 }}</ref> On June 17, 2010, the FDA sent a [[FDA Warning Letter|warning letter]] noting five potential violations, expressing concern over the testing, and requiring a response in 15 days.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm216216.htm Warning letter CIN-10-107927-14] from [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]], June 17, 2010</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= FDA warns maker of product used as alternative autism treatment |first= Trine |last= Tsouderos |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-23/health/ct-met-autism-chemical-20100623_1_boyd-haley-autism-recovery-movement-dietary-supplement |newspaper= [[Chicago Tribune]] |issn= 10856706 |date= June 23, 2010 |accessdate= September 12, 2011 }}</ref> Although Haley wrote [[op-ed]] for the [[Lexington Herald-Leader]],<ref>{{cite news |title= Dietary supplement safe for right use |first= Boyd |last= Haley |url= http://www.kentucky.com/2010/07/12/1345487/dietary-supplement-safe-for-right.html |newspaper= [[Lexington Herald-Leader]] |issn= 0745-4260 |date= June 26, 2010 |accessdate= September 12, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Supplement seller says FDA may be 'confused' |first= Trine |last= Tsouderos |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-07-12/health/ct-met-autism-chemical-update-20100712_1_dietary-supplement-fda-boyd-haley |newspaper= [[Chicago Tribune]] |issn= 10856706 |date= July 12, 2010 |accessdate= September 12, 2011 }}</ref> the FDA did not receive a formal response and OSR#1 was withdrawn from the market.<ref>{{cite news |title= Controversial supplement to come off shelves |first= Trine |last= Tsouderos |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-07-26/health/ct-met-autism-treatment-pulled-20100726_1_cti-science-web-warning-letter-expert-in-environmental-health |newspaper= [[Chicago Tribune]] |issn= 10856706 |date= July 26, 2010 |accessdate= September 12, 2011 }}</ref>
