'''Insulin shock therapy''' or '''insulin coma therapy''' (ICT) was a form of [[psychiatric]] treatment in which patients were repeatedly injected with large doses of [[insulin]] in order to produce daily [[coma]]s over several weeks.<ref name="Neu">Neustatter WL (1948) ''Modern psychiatry in practice.'' London: 224.</ref> It was introduced in 1927 by Austrian-American [[psychiatrist]] [[Manfred Sakel]] and used extensively in the 1940s and 1950s, mainly for [[schizophrenia]], before falling out of favour and being replaced by [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptic]] drugs.<ref name="Jones">{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Insulin coma therapy in schizophrenia | url = http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/93/3/147.pdf | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 147–149 | pmid = 10741319 | pmc = 1297956 }}</ref> 

Insulin coma therapy and the convulsive therapies ([[Electroconvulsive therapy|electro]] and cardiazol/metrazol) were collectively known as [[shock therapy]].<ref>Jones, GL (1948) ''Psychiatric shock therapy: current uses and practices.''

==Origins==
In 1927 Sakel, who had recently qualified as a doctor in [[Vienna]] and was working in a psychiatric clinic in [[Berlin]], began to use low (sub-coma) doses of insulin to treat drug addicts and psychopaths.<ref name="Sakel">MJ Sakel (1956) The classical Sakel shock treatment: a reappraisal. In F. Marti-Ibanez ''et al.'' (eds.) ''The great physiodynamic therapies in psychiatry: an historical reappraisal.'' New York: 13-75.</ref> Having returned to Vienna, he treated schizophrenic patients with larger doses of insulin in order to produce coma and sometimes convulsions.<ref name="Sakel"/> Sakel made public his results in 1933 and his methods were soon taken up by other psychiatrists.<ref name="Sakel"/> 

[[Joseph Wortis]], after seeing Sakel practice it in 1935, introduced it to the USA. British psychiatrists from the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency|Board of Control]] visited Vienna in 1935 and 1936, and by 1938 thirty-one hospitals in England and Wales had insulin treatment units.<ref name="Jones"/> In 1936 Sakel moved to New York and promoted the use of insulin coma treatment in American psychiatric hospitals.<ref name="Sakel"/> By the late 1940s the majority of  psychiatric hospitals in the USA were using insulin coma treatment.<ref>GL Jones (1948) ''Psychiatric shock therapy: current uses and practices.''

Insulin coma therapy was a labour-intensive treatment that required trained staff and a special unit.<ref name="Jones"/> Patients, who were almost invariably diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], were selected on the basis of having a good [[prognosis]] and the physical strength to withstand an arduous treatment.<ref name = "Doroshow2007">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/jrl044 | last1 = Doroshow | first1 = DB | year = 2007 | title = Performing a cure for schizophrenia: insulin coma therapy on the wards | url = http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/jrl044v1 | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 213–43 | pmid = 17105748 }}</ref> There were no standard guidelines for treatment; different hospitals and psychiatrists developed their own protocols.<ref name="Doroshow2007"/> Typically, injections were administered six days a week for about two months.<ref name="Neu"/> 

The daily insulin dose was gradually increased to 100–150 units until comas were produced, at which point the dose would be levelled out.<ref name="Neu"/> Occasionally doses of up to 450 units were used.<ref name="Maclay">{{cite journal | last1 = Maclay | first1 = WS | year = 1953 | title = Death Due to Treatment | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 13–20 | pmid = 13027286 | pmc = 1918466 }}</ref> After about 50 or 60 comas, or earlier if the psychiatrist thought that maximum benefit had been achieved, the dose of insulin was rapidly reduced before treatment was stopped.<ref name="Doroshow2007"/><ref name="Allen">C Allen (1949) ''Modern discoveries in medical psychology.'' London: 219-220.</ref> Courses of up to 2 years have been documented.<ref name="Allen"/>

After the insulin injection patients would experience various symptoms of decreased blood glucose: flushing, pallor, perspiration, salivation, drowsiness or restlessness.<ref name="Allen"/> [[Sopor (sleep)|Sopor]] and coma—if the dose was high enough—would follow.<ref name="Allen"/> Each coma would last for up to an hour and be terminated by intravenous glucose.<ref name="Neu"/> Seizures sometimes occurred before or during the coma.<ref name="Sargant">WW Sargant and E Slater (1954) ''An introduction to the physical methods of treatment in psychiatry'', 3rd edition. Edinburgh.</ref> Many would be tossing, rolling, moaning, twitching, spasming or thrashing around.<ref name="Doroshow2007"/> 

Some psychiatrists regarded seizures as therapeutic and patients were sometimes also given [[electroconvulsive therapy]] or cardiazol/metrazol convulsive therapy during the coma, or on the day of the week when they didn’t have insulin treatment.<ref name="Allen">C Allen (1949) ''Modern discoveries in medical psychology.'' London.</ref><ref name="Sargant"/> When they were not in a coma, insulin coma patients were kept together in a group and given special treatment and attention; one handbook for psychiatric nurses, written by British psychiatrist [[Eric Cunningham Dax]], instructs nurses to take their insulin patients out walking and occupy them with games and competitions, flower-picking and map-reading, etc.<ref>EC Dax (1947) [http://highroydspauperlunaticasylum.fotopic.net/c1564171.html ''Modern mental treatment : a handbook for nurses''.] London: 13-14.</ref> Patients required continuous supervision as there was a danger of hypoglycaemic aftershocks after the coma.<ref name="Jones"/>

In "modified insulin therapy", used in the treatment of neurosis, patients were given lower (sub-coma) doses of insulin.<ref name="Allen"/>

==Effects==
Although a few psychiatrists (including Sakel) claimed success rates for insulin coma therapy of over 80 percent in the treatment of schizophrenia, and a few argued that it merely sped up remission in those patients who would undergo remission anyway, the consensus at the time was somewhere in between - claiming a success rate of about 50 percent in patients who had been ill for less than a year (about double the spontaneous remission rate) with no influence on relapse.<ref name="Sakel"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mayer-Gross W | year = 1950 | title = Insulin coma therapy of schizophrenia: some critical remarks on Dr Sakel's report | url = | journal = Journal of Mental Science | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 132–135 }}</ref> 

Sakel suggested the therapy worked by "causing an intensification of the tonus of the parasympathetic end of the autonomic nervous system, by blockading the nerve cell, and by strengthening the anabolic force which induces the restoration of the normal function of the nerve cell and the recovery of the patient."<ref name="Sakel"/> The shock therapies in general had developed on the erroneous premise that [[epilepsy]] and schizophrenia rarely occurred in the same patient. Another theory was that patients were somehow "jolted" out of their mental illness.<ref name="Fennell1996">Phil Fennell (1996) [http://books.google.com/books?id=XqlBoZ_Vm7UC Treatment Without Consent: Law, Psychiatry and the Treatment of Mentally Disordered People Since 1845] Routledge, 1996 ISBN 0-415-07787-7</ref>

The [[hypoglycemia]] (pathologically low [[glucose]] levels) that resulted from ICT made patients extremely restless, sweaty, and liable to further convulsions and "after-shocks". In addition, patients invariably emerged from the long course of treatment "grossly [[obese]]".<ref name="Doroshow2007"/> The most severe risks of insulin coma therapy were death and brain damage, resulting from irreversible or prolonged coma respectively.<ref name="Neu"/><ref name="Maclay"/> A study at the time actually claimed that many of the cases of brain damage were actually therapeutic improvement because they showed "loss of tension and hostility".<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/k45m615x81qqr152/ Observations on organic brain damage and clinical improvement following protracted insulin coma (1955)]</ref> Mortality risk estimates varied from about one percent<ref name="Jones"/> to 4.9 percent.<ref name="Ebaugh">{{cite journal | last1 = Ebaugh | first1 = FG | year = 1943 | title = A review of the drastic shock therapies in the treatment of the psychoses | url = | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 279–296 }}</ref>

==Decline==
Insulin coma therapy was used in most hospitals in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1940s and 1950s, but the numbers of patients were restricted by the requirement for intensive medical and nursing supervision and the length of time it took to complete a course of treatment. For example at one typical large British psychiatric hospital, [[Severalls Hospital]] in Essex, insulin coma treatment was given to 39 patients in 1956. The same year 18 patients received modified insulin treatment, whilst 432 patients were given electroconvulsive treatment.<ref>D Gittens (1998) ''Narratives of Severalls Hospital, 1913-1977''. Oxford: 197-199.</ref> 

In 1953 British psychiatrist Harold Bourne published a paper entitled "The insulin myth" in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'', in which he argued that there was no sound basis for believing that insulin coma therapy counteracted the schizophrenic process in a specific way. If treatment worked, he said, it was because patients were chosen for their good prognosis and were given special treatment: "insulin patients tend to be an elite group sharing common privileges and perils".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bourne | first1 = H. | year = 1953 | title = The insulin myth. ''Lancet | url = | journal = Ii | volume = 265 | issue = 6798| pages = 964–8 | pmid = 13110026 }}</ref> 

In 1957, when insulin coma treatment use was already declining, the ''Lancet'' published the results of a randomized, controlled trial where patients were either given insulin coma treatment or identical treatment but with unconsciousness produced by [[barbiturates]].  There was no difference in outcome between the groups and the authors concluded that, whatever the benefits of the coma regime, insulin was not the specific therapeutic agent.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ackner | first1 = B | last2 = Harris | first2 = A | last3 = Oldham | first3 = AJ | title = Insulin treatment of schizophrenia; a controlled study | journal = Lancet | volume = 272 | issue = 6969 | pages = 607–11 | year = 1957 | pmid = 13407078 }}</ref>

==Recent writing==
Recent articles about insulin coma treatment have attempted to explain why it was given such uncritical acceptance. In the United States Deborah Doroshow writes that insulin coma therapy secured its foothold in psychiatry not because of scientific evidence or knowledge of any mechanism of therapeutic action, but due to the impressions it made on the minds of the medical practitioners within the local world in which it was administered and the dramatic recoveries they saw in some patients. Today, she writes, those who were involved are often ashamed, recalling it as unscientific and inhumane. Administering insulin coma therapy made psychiatry seem a more legitimately medical field. Harold Bourne, who questioned the treatment at the time, is quoted: "It meant that psychiatrists had something to do. It made them feel like real doctors instead of just institutional attendants".<ref name="Doroshow2007"/>

One retired psychiatrist who was interviewed by Doroshow "described being won over because his patients were so sick and alternative treatments did not exist".<ref name="Doroshow2007"/> Doroshow argues that "psychiatrists used complications to exert their practical and intellectual expertise in a hospital setting" and that collective risk-taking established "especially tight bonds among unit staff members".<ref name="Doroshow2007"/> She finds it ironic that psychiatrists "who were willing to take large therapeutic risks were extremely careful in their handling of adverse effects". Psychiatrists interviewed by Doroshow recalled how insulin coma patients were provided with various routines and recreational and group-therapeutic activities, to a much greater extent than most psychiatric patients. Insulin coma specialists often chose patients whose problems were the most recent and who had the best [[prognosis]]; in one case discussed by Doroshow a patient had already started to show improvement before insulin coma treatment, and after the treatment denied that it had helped, but the psychiatrists nevertheless argued that it had.<ref name="Doroshow2007"/>

In the United Kingdom psychiatrist Kingsley Jones sees the support of the Board of Control as important in persuading psychiatrists to use insulin coma therapy. The treatment then acquired the privileged status of a standard procedure, protected by professional organizational interests. He also notes that it has been suggested that the [[Mental Treatment Act 1930]] encouraged psychiatrists to experiment with physical treatments.<ref name="Jones"/>

British lawyer Phil Fennell notes that patients "must have been terrified" by the insulin shock procedures and the effects of the massive overdoses of insulin, and were often rendered more compliant and easier to manage after a course.<ref name="Fennell1996">P Fennell (1996) [http://books.google.com/books?id=XqlBoZ_Vm7UC ''Treatment Without Consent: Law, Psychiatry and the Treatment of Mentally Disordered People Since 1845.''] Oxford. ISBN 0-415-07787-7</ref> 

[[Leonard Roy Frank]], an American [[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivor]] of 50 forced insulin coma treatments combined with ECT has described it as "the most devastating, painful and humiliating experience of my life", a "flat-out atrocity" glossed over by psychiatric [[euphemism]], and a violation of basic human rights.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = LR | year = 2002 | title = Psychiatry's Unholy Trinity--Fraud, Fear and Force: a personal account | url = http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/psychiatrys-unholy-trinity-fraud-fear-and-force-a-personal-account/ | journal = The Freeman - Ideas on Liberty | volume = 52 | issue = | page = 11 }}</ref>
