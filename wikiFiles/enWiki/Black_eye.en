A '''black eye''', '''periorbital [[hematoma]]''', or a '''shiner''', is [[ecchymosis]] (bruising) around the eye commonly due to an injury to the face rather than eye injury. The name is given due to the color of bruising. The so-called black eye is caused by bleeding beneath the skin and around the eye. Sometimes, a black eye indicates a more extensive injury, even a skull fracture, particularly if the area around both eyes is bruised, or if there has been a prior head injury.

Although most black eye injuries aren't serious, bleeding within the eye, called a [[hyphema]], is serious and can reduce vision and damage the cornea. In some cases, abnormally high pressure inside the eyeball (ocular hypertension) also can result.

==Presentation and prognosis==
[[File:Black Eye 01.jpg|right|thumb|Progression of periorbital hematoma over ten days: the blood is gradually absorbed, but the iron-laden pigments in the blood remain in the tissue leaving a discoloration that persists for longer.]] 

Despite the name, the eye itself is not affected. Blunt force or trauma to the eye socket results in burst [[capillaries]] and subsequent [[haemorrhaging]] ([[hematoma]]).<ref name="nhs">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/black-eye/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Black Eye |date=18 March 2011 |work=NHS Choices |publisher=NHS |accessdate=27 October 2012}}</ref> The fatty tissue along with the lack of muscle around the eye socket allows a potential space for blood accumulation. As this blood is reabsorbed, various pigments are released similar to a bruise lending itself to the extreme outward appearance.<ref name="nhs" />

The dramatic appearance (discoloration purple black and blue and swelling) does not necessarily indicate a serious injury, and most black eyes resolve within a week.

==Treatment==
Unless there is actual trauma to the eye itself ([[#Associated conditions|see below]]), extensive medical attention is generally not needed.<ref name="nhs" />

Applying an [[ice pack]] will keep down swelling and reduce internal bleeding by constricting the capillaries. Additionally, [[analgesic drugs]] (painkillers) can be administered to relieve pain.<ref name="nhs" />

==Associated conditions==
Eye injury and head trauma may also coincide with a black eye. Some common signs of a more serious injury may include:
* [[Diplopia|Double vision]]
* Loss of sight and or fuzzy vision could occur
* [[Loss of consciousness]]
* Inability to move the eye or large swelling around the eye
* Blood or clear fluid from the nose or the ears
* Blood on the surface of the eye itself or cuts on the eye itself
* Persistent [[headache]] or [[migraine]]
