'''Child abuse''' is the physical, sexual or emotional mistreatment or neglect of a child or children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Child+abuse |title=Child abuse – definition of child abuse by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and the Department for Children And Families (DCF) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.<ref name = CDC>{{cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm | accessdate =20 October 2008 | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | title = Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements | date = 1 January 2008 | author = Leeb, R.T. | coauthors = Paulozzi, L.J.; Melanson, C.; Simon, T.R.; Arias, I.}}</ref> Child abuse can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: [[child neglect|neglect]], [[physical abuse]], [[psychological abuse|psychological or emotional abuse]], and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]].

Different jurisdictions have developed their own definitions of what constitutes child abuse for the purposes of removing a child from his/her family and/or prosecuting a criminal charge. According to the ''Journal of Child Abuse and Neglect'', child abuse is "any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm".<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2005.04.002 | last1 = Herrenkohl | first1 = R.C. | year = 2005 | title = The definition of child maltreatment: from case study to construct | url = | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 413–24 | pmid = 15970317 }}</ref>

However, Douglas J. Besharov, J.D., LL.M., the first Director of the U.S. Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, states "the existing laws are often vague and overly broad"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/fixing_child_protection |title=Fixing Child Protection | author = Besharov, Douglas J. |publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable |accessdate=1 January 1998 |pages = 1–4}}</ref> and there is a "lack of consensus among professionals and Child Protective Services (CPS) personnel about what the terms abuse and neglect mean".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cssronline.org/CSSR/Archival/2007/Krason.pdf |title=The Critics of Current Child Abuse Laws and the Child Protective System: A Survey of the Leading | author = Krason, Stephen M. |publisher=The Catholic Social Science Review |accessdate=2007 |pages = 307–350}}</ref> Dr. Susan Orr, Ph.D. former head of the United States Children’s Bureau U.S. Department of Health and Services- Administration for Children and Families, 2001-2007, states that "much that is now defined as child abuse and neglect does not merit governmental interference".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/6882.pdf |title=Policy Study 262 Child Protection at the Crossroads: Child Abuse, Child Protection and Recommendations for Reform |author=Orr, Susan |accessdate=1 October 1999}}</ref>

==Types==
Child abuse can take several forms:<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web| url = http://www.helpguide.org/mental/child_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm | title = Child Abuse and Neglect: Types, Signs, Symptoms, Help and Prevention | accessdate =20 October 2008 | publisher = helpguide.org}}</ref> The four main types are physical, sexual, psychological, and neglect.<ref>[http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/foundation/foundationc.cfm A Coordinated Response to Child Abuse and Neglect: The Foundation for Practice], Office on Child Abuse and doctor]</ref> According to the 2010 Child Maltreatment Report (NCANDS), a yearly Federal report based on submission by state Child Protective Services (CPS) Agencies, “as in prior years, neglect was the most common form of maltreatment.” The cases were substantiated as follows: neglect 78.3%, physical abuse 17.6%, sexual abuse 9.2%, and psychological maltreatment 8.1%.),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/canstats.pdf  |title=Child Maltreatment 2010: Summary of Key Findings |publisher=Children’s Bureau, Child Welfare Information Gateway, Protecting Children Strengthening Families |accessdate = May 2012}}</ref> According to Richard Wexler, the Director of National Coalition of Child Protection Reform, of “those labeled “substantiated” or “indicated” by protective workers, relatively few are the kind that leap to mind when we hear the words “child abuse”.

===Physical abuse===
[[Physical abuse]] involves physical aggression directed at a child by an adult. Most nations with child-abuse laws consider the deliberate infliction of serious injuries, or actions that place the child at obvious risk of serious injury or death, to be illegal. Physical abuse is the intentional or non-accidental production of a physical injury. Bruises, scratches, burns, broken bones, lacerations, as well as repeated “mishaps,” and rough treatment that could cause physical injury, are the results of physical abuse.<ref name="Theoklitou, D 2011">Theoklitou, D,. Kabitisis, N., Kabitsi, A. (2011).  Physical and emotional abuse of primary school children by teachers. Child Abuse & Neglect, V. 36, 64-70.</ref> Beyond this, there is considerable variation. The distinction between [[child discipline]] and abuse is often poorly defined. Cultural norms about what constitutes abuse vary widely: among professionals as well as the wider public, people do not agree on what behaviors constitute abuse.<ref name="anh">Noh Anh, Helen (1994). "Cultural Diversity and the Definition of Child Abuse", in Barth, R.P. et al., ''Child welfare research review'', Columbia University Press, 1994, p. 28.

===Psychological/emotional abuse===
{{Main|Emotional abuse}}
Emotional abuse is defined as the production of psychological and social deficits in the growth of a child as a result of behavior such as loud yelling, coarse and rude attitude, inattention, harsh criticism, and denigration of the child's personality.<ref name="Theoklitou, D 2011"/> Other examples include name-calling, ridicule, degradation, destruction of personal belongings, [[torture]] or killing of a pet, excessive [[criticism]], inappropriate or excessive demands, withholding communication, and routine labeling or [[humiliation]].<ref name=ncvc-ca>{{cite web|url=http://ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&DocumentAction=ViewProperties&DocumentID=32313&UrlToReturn=http%3a%2f%2fncvc.org%2fncvc%2fmain.aspx%3fdbName%3dAdvancedSearch&gclid=CJ_1q6m2oZ4CFcx25QodNG2_ow|title=Child Abuse|publisher=The National Center for Victims of Crime}}</ref>

Victims of emotional abuse may react by distancing themselves from the abuser, internalizing the abusive words, or fighting back by [[insult]]ing the abuser.  Emotional abuse can result in abnormal or disrupted [[attachment theory|attachment development]], a tendency for victims to blame themselves ([[self-blame]]) for the abuse, [[learned helplessness]], and overly passive behavior.<ref name=ncvc-ca/>

===Neglect===
{{Main|Child neglect}}
[[File:Cretin Child (1).jpg|thumb|Severely retarded girl in [[Bhutan]]]]
Child neglect is the failure of a parent or other person with responsibility for the child to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision to the degree that the child's health, safety, and well-being are threatened with harm. Neglect is also a lack of attention from the people surrounding a child, and the non-provision of the relevant and adequate necessities for the child's survival, which would be a lacking in attention, love, and nurture.<ref>Theoklitou, D., Kabitisis, N., Kabitsi, A. (2011).  Physical and emotional abuse of primary school children by teachers. Child Abuse & Neglect, V. 36, 64-70.</ref> Some of the observable signs in a neglected child include: the child is frequently absent from school, begs or steals food or money, lacks needed medical and dental care, is consistently dirty, lacks sufficient clothing for the weather.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronic Neglect |url= http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf#Page=2&view=Fit |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> 

Neglected children may experience delays in physical and psychosocial development, possibly resulting in psychopathology and impaired [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] functions including [[executive function]], [[attention]], [[processing speed]], language, memory and social skills.<ref name="test">{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/families/resources/newsletter/2012/07/neurocognitive-impacts.aspx |title=Neurocognitive impacts for children of poverty and neglect |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> Researchers investigating maltreated children have repeatedly found that neglected 
children in foster and adoptive populations manifest different emotional and behavioral reactions to regain lost or secure relationships and are frequently reported to have disorganized attachments and a need to control their environment. Such children are not likely to view caregivers as being a source of safety, and instead typically show an increase in aggressive and hyperactive behaviors which may disrupt healthy or secure attachment with their adopted parents. These children have apparently learned to adapt to an abusive and inconsistent caregiver by becoming cautiously self-reliant, and are often described as glib, manipulative and disingenuous in their interactions with others as they move through childhood.<ref name="Golden, J.A. 2009">Golden, J.A., Prather, W. (2009). A behavioral perspective of childhood trauma and attachment issues: toward alternative treatment approaches for children with a history of abuse.  International Journal of Behavioral and Consultation Therapy, V.5, 56-74.</ref> Children who are victims of neglect have a more difficult time forming and maintaining relationships, such as romantic or friendship, later in life due to the lack of attachment they had in their earlier stages of life.

David Finkelhor, Ph.D. (Director, Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire) in his study, "Updated Trends in Child Maltreatment, 2010," tracked Child Maltreatment Report (NCANDS) data from 1990 to 2010. He states that sexual abuse has declined 62% from 1992 to 2009. The long term trend for physical abuse is also down, decreasing 56% since 1992. The decline in sexual abuse adds to an already substantial positive long term trend. He states: "It is unfortunate that information about the trends in child maltreatment are not better publicized and more widely known. The long-term decline in sexual and physical abuse may have important implications for public policy."<ref name="Finkelhor">{{cite web|url=http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV203_Updated%20trends%202010%20FINAL_12-19-11.pdf |title=Updated Trends in Child Maltreatment, 2010 |last=Finkelhor  |first=David |coauthors= Lisa Jones, Anne Shuttuch  |publisher=University of New Hampshire, Crimes Against Children Research Center |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>

A [[UNICEF]] report on child wellbeing stated that the United States and the United Kingdom ranked lowest among industrial nations with respect to the wellbeing of children. It also found that child neglect and child abuse were far more common in single-parent families than in families where both parents are present.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/ChildPovertyReport.pdf Child Poverty in Respective: An Overview of Child Wellbeing in Rich Countries].

In the USA, neglect is defined as the failure to meet the basic needs of children including housing, clothing, food and access to medical care. Researchers found over 91,000 cases of neglect in one year (from October 2005 to 30 September 2006) using information from a database of cases verified by protective services agencies.<ref name=CDC/>

Neglect could also take the form of [[financial abuse]] by not buying the child adequate materials for survival.<ref>[http://www.santaynezvalleyjournal.com/archive/7/43/5328/ "Sometimes They Can't Afford to Leave their Abusers"], ''Santa Ynez Valley Journal'', California, 22 October 2009.</ref>

===Fatalities===
A child abuse fatality occurs when a child's death is the result of abuse or neglect, or when abuse and/or neglect are contributing factors to a child's death. In the United States, 1,730 children died in 2008 due to factors related to abuse; this is a rate of 2 per 100,000 U.S. children.<ref>[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm08/cm08.pdf Child Maltreatment 2008], U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, p.&nbsp;55.</ref> Family situations which place children at risk include moving, unemployment, having non-family members living in the household. A number of policies and programs have been put in place in the U.S. to try to better understand and to prevent child abuse fatalities, including: [[safe-haven law]]s, child fatality review teams, training for investigators, [[shaken baby syndrome]] prevention programs, and child abuse death laws which mandate harsher sentencing for taking the life of a child.<ref>For a review of this literature, see, Douglas, E.M., 2005, ''Child maltreatment fatalities: What do we know, what have we learned, and where do we go from here?,''pp 4.1–4.18, in Child Victimization, edited by K.

A study on child abuse sought to determine: the forms of child abuse perpetrated on children with disabilities; the extent of child abuse; and the causes of child abuse of children with disabilities. A questionnaire on child abuse was adapted and used to collect data in this study. Participants comprised a sample of 31 pupils with disabilities (15 children with vision impairment and 16 children with hearing impairment) selected from special schools in Botswana. The study found that the majority of participants were involved in doing domestic chores. They were also sexually, physically and emotionally abused by their teachers.

[[Substance abuse]] can be a major contributing factor to child abuse.

Child-abuse cases go through screeners like Belisle to an "assessment" worker, the job Belisle used to handle. Eventually they reach the various social workers and services (counseling, referral to day care centers and Alcoholics Anonymous in local neighborhoods). Having been abused as a child seems to lead to a repetition with one's own children. Beyond that, the causes of child abuse seem to be deep-rooted anger and frustration and an intolerable sense of physical or emotional inadequacy. Anger most of all. "They don't know how to control it," says Belisle's co-worker Anna Ferzoco.<ref>Blampied, P. (1978). In Massachusetts: A Hot Line To Tragedy. Time, 112(19), 6.</ref>

A 1988 study of child murders in the US found that children are 100 times more often killed by a "non-biological parent (e.g. step-parent, co-habitee or boyfriend/girlfriend of a biological parent)" than by a biological parent.<ref name = Roach2011>{{cite doi|10.4236/psych.2011.24062}}</ref> An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that using resources in order to take care of another person's biological child is likely not a good strategy for increasing [[reproductive success]].<ref name = Roach2011/> More generally, stepchildren have a much higher risk of being abused which is sometimes referred to as the [[Cinderella effect]].

Psychologists conducted a study in the United States in 2010 which examined over 200 regular church attendees from eleven different denominations of [[Christianity]], most of whom were educated, upper-middle class White Americans, found that [[Religious orientation#Extrinsic Religious Orientations|extrinsic religious orientation]] was associated with a greater risk of physical child abuse. Those with a more extrinsic religious orientation who also adhered to greater [[normative social influence|social conformity]] were particularly more likely to share characteristics with physically abusive subjects. Subjects who adhered to [[Biblical literalism]] exhibited a higher potential of physical child abuse. Those who had a more [[Religious orientation#Intrinsic Religious Orientation|intrinsic religious orientation]] were not found to be at a greater risk of child abuse, although they sometimes exhibited greater social conformity or a greater propensity for holding literal interpretations of the Bible.

==Child abuse worldwide==
[[File:Girl sufferedwithburnwounds.jpg|thumb|A girl who was burned during [[religious violence in Orissa]], India.]]
Child abuse is an international phenomenon. [[Poverty]] and [[substance abuse]] are common widespread international issues, and no matter the location, show a similar trend in the correlation to child abuse. 

Although these issues can likely contribute to child maltreatment, differences in cultural perspectives play a significant role in the treatment of children. In certain nations, the battle for [[Gender equality|equality]] within the sexes plays a large part in a child’s upbringing. During the [[Soviet period]], there were conflicts regarding the traditional housewife versus the emphasis on equality within the sexes. Some women felt a considerable amount of pressure to carry out their motherly duties, obtaining an “[[authoritarian]]” parenting style, acting dominating and emotionally distant towards her children while overly involved in her own career.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004">{{cite journal | author = Sebre S., Sprugevica I., Novotni A., Bonevski D., Pakalniskiene V., Popescu D. ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Cross-cultural comparisons of child-reported emotional and physical abuse: Rates, risk factors and psychosocial symptoms | url = | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect, The International Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 113–127 }}</ref> Many were encouraged to use more firm and direct disciplinary methods, as well as be overbearing and overprotective of their children.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004"/>

Now that this Communist Era has ended, there are many positive changes being put into play. While there is a new openness and acceptance regarding parenting styles and close relationships with children, child abuse still remains a serious concern. Although it is now more publicly recognized, it has certainly not cease to exist. While controlling parenting may be less of a concern, financial difficulty, [[unemployment]], and substance abuse still remain to be dominating factors in child abuse throughout [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004"/>

A study conducted by members from several [[Baltic states|Baltic]] and [[Eastern European]] countries, together with specialists from the [[United States]], examined the causes of child abuse in the countries of [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Moldova]]. In these countries, respectively, 33%, 42%, 18% and 43% of children reported at least one type of child abuse.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sebre S., Sprugevica I., Novotni A., Bonevski D., Pakalniskiene V., Popescu D. ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Cross-cultural comparisons of child-reported emotional and physical abuse: Rates, risk factors and [[psychosocial]] symptoms | url = | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect, The International Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 113–127 }}</ref> According to their findings, there was a serious of correlations between the potential risk factors of parental employment status, [[alcohol abuse]], and family size within the abuse ratings.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004"/> In three of the four countries, parental substance abuse was considerably correlated with the presence of child abuse, and although it was a lower percentage, still showed a relationship in the fourth country (Moldova).<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004"/> Each country also showed a connection between the father not working outside of the home and either emotional or physical child abuse.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004"/>

These cultural differences can be studied from many perspectives. Most importantly, overall parental behavior is genuinely different in various countries. Many may view child abuse, both emotional and physical, as socially acceptable. Each [[culture]] has their own "range of acceptability," and what one may view as offensive, others may seem as tolerable. Behaviors that are normal to some may be viewed as abusive to others, all depending on the [[societal norms]] of that particular country.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004"/> 

[[Asia]]n parenting perspectives, specifically, hold different ideals from [[United States|American]] [[culture]]. Many have described their traditions as including [[physical]] and [[emotional]] closeness that ensures a lifelong bond between parent and child, as well as establishing parental authority and child obedience through harsh [[discipline]].<ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006">Lau, A. S., Takeuchi, D. T., & Alegría, M. (2006). Parent-to-child aggression among Asian American parents: Culture, context, and vulnerability. ''Journal of Marriage and Family'', 68(5), 1261-1275. Retrieved</ref> Balancing disciplinary responsibilities within parenting is common in many [[Asia]]n cultures, including [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Korea]].<ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006"/> To some cultures, forceful parenting may be seen as abuse, but in other societies such as these, the use of force is looked at as a reflection of parental devotion.<ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006"/>

The differences in these cultural beliefs demonstrate the importance of examining all [[cross-cultural]] perspectives when studying the concept of child abuse.

As of 2006, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, had been accused of [[Witch Children in Africa|witchcraft]] and abandoned.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 12, 2006</ref> In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result.<ref>Byrne, Carrie 2011.

==Effects==
There are strong associations between exposure to child abuse in all its forms and higher rates of many chronic conditions. In the United States, the strongest evidence comes from the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE's) series of studies which show correlations between exposure to abuse or neglect and higher rates in adulthood of chronic conditions, high-risk health behaviors and shortened lifespan.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Middlebrooks, J.S.; Audage, A.C. |title=The Effects of Childhood Stress on Health Across the Lifespan |year=2008 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control}}</ref> A recent publication, ''Hidden Costs in Health Care: The Economic Impact of Violence and Abuse'',<ref>{{Cite book|author=Dolezal, T.; McCollum, D.; Callahan, M. |title=Hidden Costs in Health Care: The Economic Impact of Violence and Abuse |year=2009 |publisher=Academy on Violence and Abuse}}</ref> makes the case that such exposure represents a serious and costly public-health issue that should be addressed by the healthcare system. A big concern with researchers is the degree to which maltreated children grow up to be maltreating adults or if they exhibit social signs of abuse or neglect. Studies show that 90 percent of maltreating adults were maltreated as children in their life. When children were two, studies show that 16 percent of 267 high-risk mothers mistreated thir own children, to different effects.<ref name="Wolfe">Wolfe, S. (1991). The Effects of Child Abuse and Neglect (pp. 1-33). New York: The Guilford Press.</ref> The first two years of a child's life is when parents invest the least in their children.

New Republic, 242(18), 10-13.</ref> 16 percent of those 267 high risk mothers mistreat their two year old children in different ways. 55 percent of the children experienced physical abuse, 55 percent experienced neglect, 43 percent experienced hostile and rejecting parenting, and 43 percent experienced unavailable parenting.<ref name="Wolfe"/>

Victims of childhood abuse, it is claimed, also suffer from different types of physical health problems later in life. Some reportedly suffer from some type of chronic head, abdominal, pelvic, or muscular pain with no identifiable reason.<ref name="ReferenceA">Takele Hamnasu, MBA. ''Impact of Childhood Abuse on Adult Health''. Amberton University.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Even though the majority of childhood abuse victims know or believe that their abuse is, or can be, the cause of different health problems in their adult life, for the great majority their abuse was not directly associated with those problems, indicating that sufferers were most likely diagnosed with other possible causes for their health problems, instead of their childhood abuse.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> One long-term study found that up to 80% of abused people had at least one psychiatric disorder at age 21, with problems including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and suicide attempts.<ref>Silverman, Reinherz, & Giaconia, 1996, see http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/long_term_consequences.cfm#psych</ref> One Canadian hospital found that between 36% and 76% of women mental health outpatients had been abused, as had 58% of women and 23% of men schizophrenic inpatients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/publications/factsheets/child-sexual-abuse |title=Childhood Sexual Abuse: A Mental Health Issue |publisher=Here to Help |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>

In the case of 23 of the 27 illnesses listed in the questionnaire of a French [[INSEE]] survey, some statistically significant correlations were found between repeated illness and family traumas encountered by the child before the age of 18 years. According to [[Georges Menahem]], the French sociologist who found out these correlations by studying health inequalities, these relationships show that inequalities in illness and suffering are not only social. Health inequality also has its origins in the family, where it is associated with the degrees of lasting affective problems (lack of affection, parental discord, the prolonged absence of a parent, or a serious illness affecting either the mother or father) that individuals report having experienced in childhood.<ref>"Study of Living Conditions 1986–1987" INSEE survey with a sample of 13–154 individuals, cf.

===Physical effects===
[[File:Fractured ribs.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rib fracture]]s in an infant secondary to child abuse]]
Children who are physically abused are likely to receive bone fractures, particularly rib fractures,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kemp AM, Dunstan F, Harrison S, ''et al.'' |title=Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: systematic review |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |issue= oct02 1|pages=a1518 |year=2008 |pmid=18832412 |pmc=2563260 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18832412 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a1518}}</ref> and may have a higher risk of developing cancer.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fuller-Thomson E, Brennenstuhl S |title=Making a link between childhood physical abuse and cancer: results from a regional representative survey |journal=Cancer |volume=115 |issue=14 |pages=3341–50 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19472404 |doi=10.1002/cncr.24372}}</ref>
Children who experience child abuse & neglect are 59% more likely to be arrested as juveniles, 28% more likely to be arrested as adults, and 30% more likely to commit violent crime.<ref>[http://www.childhelp.org/pages/statistics Child Abuse Statistics]</ref>

The immediate physical effects of abuse or neglect can be relatively minor (bruises or cuts) or severe (broken bones, hemorrhage, or even death). In some cases the physical effects are temporary; however, the pain and suffering they cause a child should not be discounted. Meanwhile, the long-term impact of child abuse and neglect on physical health is just beginning to be explored. The long-term effects can be:

* [[Shaken baby syndrome]]. Shaking a baby is a common form of child abuse that often results in permanent neurological damage (80% of cases) or death (30% of cases).<ref>Morad Y, Wygnansky-Jaffe T, Levin AV (2010) Retinal haemorrhage in abusive head trauma. Clin Exp Ophthalmol 38:514–520.</ref> Damage results from intracranial hypertension (increased pressure in the skull) after bleeding in the brain, damage to the spinal cord and neck, and rib or bone fractures (Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2007).

* Impaired brain development. Child abuse and neglect have been shown, in some cases, to cause important regions of the brain to fail to form or grow properly, resulting in impaired development (De Bellis & Thomas, 2003). These alterations in brain maturation have long-term consequences for cognitive, language, and academic abilities (Watts-English, Fortson, Gibler, Hooper, & De Bellis, 2006). NSCAW found more than three-quarters of foster children between 1 and 2 years of age to be at medium to high risk for problems with brain development, as opposed to less than half of children in a control sample (ACF/OPRE, 2004a).

* Poor physical health. Several studies have shown a relationship between various forms of household dysfunction (including childhood abuse) and poor health (Flaherty et al., 2006; Felitti, 2002). Adults who experienced abuse or neglect during childhood are more likely to suffer from physical ailments such as allergies, arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, high blood pressure, and ulcers (Springer, Sheridan, Kuo, & Carnes, 2007).<ref>[http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/long_term_consequences.cfm#factors Factsheet]</ref>

On the other hand, there are some children who are raised in child abuse, but who manage to do unexpectedly well later in life regarding the preconditions. Such children have been termed ''{{visible anchor|dandelion children}}'', as inspired from the way that [[dandelion]]s seem to prosper irrespective of soil, sun, drought, or rain.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00571.x}}</ref> Such children (or currently grown-ups) are of high interest in finding factors that mitigate the effects of child abuse.

==Prevention==
A support-group structure is needed to reinforce parenting skills and closely monitor the child's well-being.
Visiting home nurse or social-worker visits are also required to observe and evaluate the progress of the child and his/her caretaking situation.
The support-group structure and visiting home nurse or social-worker visits are not mutually exclusive. Many studies have demonstrated that the two measures must be coupled together for the best possible outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/child_abuse/page8.htm#how_can_child_abuse_be_prevented |title=Child Abuse Symptoms, Causes, Treatment - How can child abuse be prevented? on MedicineNet |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>
Children's school programs regarding "good touch...bad touch" can provide children with a forum in which to role-play and learn to avoid potentially harmful scenarios.
Unintended conception increases the risk of subsequent child abuse, and large family size increases the risk of child neglect.<ref name=BestIntent />  Thus a comprehensive study for the National Academy of Sciences concluded that affordable [[birth control|contraceptive]] services should form the basis for child abuse prevention.<ref name=BestIntent /><ref>{{cite report|title = Optimal Caregiving and Child Abuse: Continuities and Discontinuities.

April has been designated Child Abuse Prevention Month in the United States since 1983.<ref>[http://www.childwelfare.gov/preventing/preventionmonth/history.cfm Child Welfare Information Gateway], History of National Child Abuse Prevention Month. 3 April 2009.</ref>  U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] continued that tradition by declaring April 2009 Child Abuse Prevention Month.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Presidential-Proclamation-Marking-National-Child-Abuse-Prevention-Month/ Presidential Proclamation Marking National Child Abuse Prevention Month]. The White House – Press Room, 1 April 2009.</ref>  One way the [[Federal government of the United States]] provides funding for child-abuse prevention is through Community-Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (CBCAP).<ref>[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/programs_fund/state_tribal/cbcap.htm U.S. Administration for Children and Families]. Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Bureau.</ref> Each year during Child Abuse Prevention Month, “often media and commentators take the number of reports to be synonymous with the number of cases of actual child maltreatment; this is obviously not the case”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cssronline.org/CSSR/Archival/2005/Krason_215-231.pdf |title=Child Abuse and Neglect: Failed Policy and Assault on Innocent |publisher=The Catholic Social Science Review |accessdate=2005 |pages =217,  215–231}}</ref> From the 3.3 million hotline calls (2010), there were less than 475,000 substantiated cases (2010 NCANDS:  436,321 substantiated+24,976 indicated=461,297 total), resulting in about 15% of hotline calls substantiated/indicated, of which 78.3% were for neglect.<ref name="childwelfare.gov"/><ref name="Child Maltreatment 2010"/> “Some argue that even many “substantiated reports involve only minor or insignificant matters, which most reasonable people would not truly consider abuse or neglect.”.<ref name="Krason, Stephen M. 340, 307–350"/>
The 3.3 million annual (hotline) referrals effects on average 1 out of 10 U.S. families with children (There are 32,200,000 U.S. families with children under 18 according to the 2010 U.S. Census) .<ref name="census.gov"/> “Unsubstantiated rates of the current magnitude go beyond anything reasonably needed; a high rate of unsubstantiated reports should concern everyone”, according to Douglas Besharov J.D., LL.M. and former Director of the US Center for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. He further states “each report results in what can be an intrusive and traumatic investigation that is inherently a breach of parental and family privacy. The emotionally charged desire to “do something” about child abuse, fanned by repeated and often sensational media coverage has led to an understandable, but counterproductive over reaction on the part of the professionals and citizens who report child abuse” according to Dr. Besharov.<ref>[http://www.welfareacademy.org/pubs/childwelfare/respondingto_94.pdf |title= Responding to Child Sexual Abuse: The Need for a Balanced Approach |author=Besharov, Douglas J, |journal=The Future of Children| volume = 4|Number = 2| page = 139-140| Date = Summer/Fall 1994. ]</ref>

Resources for child-protection services are sometimes limited. According to Hosin (2007), "a considerable number of traumatized abused children do not gain access to protective child-protection strategies."<ref>{{Cite book|editor=Hosin, A.A. |year=2007 |title=Responses to traumatized children |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |page=211 |isbn=1-4039-9680-6}}</ref> Briere (1992) argues that only when "lower-level violence" of children ceases to be culturally tolerated will there be changes in the [[victimization]] and police protection of children.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Briere, John |year=1992 |title=Child abuse trauma |publisher=Sage |page=7 |isbn=0-8039-3713-X}}</ref>

==Treatment==
A number of treatments are available to victims of child abuse.<ref name=Cohen2006>{{Cite journal|author=Cohen, J.A. |coauthors=Mannarino, A.P.; Murray, L.K.; Igelman, R. |year=2006 |title=Psychosocial Interventions for Maltreated and Violence-Exposed Children |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=737–766 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2006.00485.x}}</ref> Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, first developed to treat sexually abused children, is now used for victims of any kind of trauma. It targets trauma-related symptoms in children including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] and [[anxiety]]. It also includes a component for non-offending parents. Several studies have found that sexually abused children undergoing TF-CBT improved more than children undergoing certain other therapies. Data on the effects of TF-CBT for children who experienced only non-sexual abuse was not available as of 2006.<ref name=Cohen2006 /> The purpose of dealing with the thoughts and feelings associated with the trauma is to deal with nightmares, flashbacks and other intrusive experiences that might be spontaneously brought on by any number of discriminative stimuli in the environment or in the individual’s brain. This would aid the individual in becoming less fearful of specific stimuli that would arouse debilitating fear, anger, sadness or other negative 
emotion.In other words, the individual would have some control or mastery over those emotions.<ref name="Golden, J.A. 2009"/>

Abuse-focused [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] was designed for children who have experienced physical abuse.  It targets externalizing behaviors and strengthens prosocial behaviors. Offending parents are included in the treatment, to improve parenting skills/practices. It is supported by one randomized study.<ref name=Cohen2006 />

Rational Cognitive Emotive Behavior Therapy consists of ten distinct but interdependent steps. These steps fall into one of three theoretical orientations (i.e., rational or solution focused, cognitive emotive, and behavioral) and are intended to provide abused children and their adoptive parents with positive behavior change, corrective interpersonal skills, and greater control over themselves and their relationships. They are: 1) determining  and normalizing thinking and behaving, 2) evaluating  language, 3) shifting attention away from problem talk 4) describing times when the attachment problem isn’t happening, 5) focusing on how family members “successfully” solve problematic attachment behavior; 6) acknowledging “unpleasant emotions” (i.e., angry, sad, scared) underlying negative interactional patterns, 7) identifying antecedents (controlling conditions) and associated negative cognitive emotive connections in behavior (reciprocal role of thought and emotion in behavioral causation), 8) encouraging previously abused children to experience or “own” negative thoughts and associated aversive emotional feelings, 9) modeling and rewarding positive behavior change (with themselves and in relationships), and 10) encouraging and rewarding thinking and behaving differently.  This type of therapy shifts victims thoughts away from the bad and changes their behavior.<ref name="Golden, J.A. 2009"/>

Child-parent psychotherapy was designed to improve the child-parent relationship following the experience of domestic violence. It targets trauma-related symptoms in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, including PTSD, aggression, defiance, and anxiety. It is supported by two studies of one sample.<ref name=Cohen2006 />

Other forms of treatment include group therapy, play therapy, and art therapy.  Each of these types of treatment can be used to better assist the client, depending on the form of abuse they have experienced.  Play therapy and art therapy are ways to get children more comfortable with therapy by working on something that they enjoy (coloring, drawing, painting, etc.). The design of a child's artwork can be a symbolic representation of what they are feeling, relationships with friends or family, and more.  Being able to discuss and analyze a child's artwork can allow a professional to get a better insight of the child.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = DS | last2 = Zygmunt | first2 = A | last3 = Trabka | first3 = KA | last4 = Davies | first4 = M | last5 = Colon | first5 = E | last6 = Kolodji | first6 = A | last7 = McCaw | first7 = J | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2007 | title = Child mental representations of attachment when mothers are traumatized:  The relationship of family-drawings to story-stem completion | journal = Journal of Early Childhood and Infant Psychology | volume = 3 | pages = 119–141 | pmid = 18347736 | pmc = 2268110 }}</ref>

==Ethics==
One of the most challenging ethical dilemmas arising from child abuse relates to the parental rights of abusive parents or caretakers with regard to their children, particularly in medical settings.<ref name="appel">{{Cite journal|author=Appel, J.M. |title=Mixed motives, mixed outcomes when accused parents won't agree to withdraw care |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=635–7 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19793945 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030510}}</ref> In the United States, the 2008 New Hampshire case of [[Andrew Bedner]] drew attention to this legal and moral conundrum.  Bedner, accused of severely injuring his infant daughter, sued for the right to determine whether or not she remain on life support; keeping her alive, which would have prevented a murder charge, created a motive for Bedner to act that conflicted with the apparent interests of his child.<ref name="appel"/><ref>"Springfield man denies charges in infant assault", ''Rutland Herald'', New Hampshire, 5 August 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=9711115# "Springfield Father Charged with Baby's Murder"], ''WCAX.com'', Vermont, 21 January 2009.</ref> Bioethicists [[Jacob M. Appel]] and Thaddeus Mason Pope recently argued, in separate articles, that such cases justify the replacement of the accused parent with an alternative decision-maker.<ref name="appel"/><ref>[http://medicalfutility.blogspot.com/2009/10/withdrawal-okay-when-surrogates-refusal.html "Withdrawal Okay When Surrogate's Refusal to Consent Based on Wrong Reasons"], ''Medical Futility'' (blog).</ref>

Child abuse also poses ethical concerns related to [[confidentiality]], as victims may be physically or psychologically unable to report abuse to authorities. Accordingly, many jurisdictions and professional bodies have made exceptions to standard requirements for confidentiality and [[Privilege (evidence)|legal privileges]] in instances of child abuse. Medical professionals, including doctors, therapists, and other mental health workers typically owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients and clients, either by law and/or the standards of [[professional ethics]], and cannot disclose personal information without the [[consent]] of the individual concerned. This duty conflicts with an ethical obligation to protect children from preventable harm. Accordingly, confidentiality is often waived when these professionals have a good faith suspicion that child abuse or neglect has occurred or is likely to occur and make a report to local [[child protection]] authorities. This exception allows professionals to breach confidentiality and make a report even when the child or his/her parent or guardian has specifically instructed to the contrary. Child abuse is also a common exception to [[Physician–patient privilege]]: a medical professional may be called upon to testify in court as to otherwise privileged evidence about suspected child abuse despite the wishes of the child and his/her family.<ref name="confidentiality">{{cite web|last=National Center for Youth Law|title=Minor Consent, Confidentiality, and Child Abuse Reporting|url=http://www.youthlaw.org/publications/minor_consent/|accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>

==Organizations==
There are organizations at national, state, and county levels in the United States that provide community leadership in preventing child abuse and neglect. The National Alliance of Children's Trust Funds and Prevent Child Abuse America are two national organizations with member organizations at the state level.

Many investigations into child abuse are handled on the local level by Child Advocacy Centers. Started over 25 years ago at what is now known as the National Children's Advocacy Center<ref>[http://nationalcac.org/index.html Nationalcac.org]</ref> in Huntsville, Alabama by District Attorney Robert "Bud" Cramer these multi-disciplinary teams have met to coordinate their efforts so that cases of child abuse can be investigated quickly and efficiently, ultimately reducing trauma to the child and garnering better convictions.<ref>[http://nationalcac.org/professionals/model/cac_model.html Nationalcac.org]</ref><ref>[http://nationalcac.org/ncac/history.html Nationalcac.org]</ref> These Child Advocacy Centers (known as CACs) have standards set by the National Children's Alliance.<ref>[http://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/ Nationalchildrensalliance.org]</ref>

Other organizations focus on specific prevention strategies.  The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome focuses its efforts on the specific issue of preventing child abuse that is manifested as [[shaken baby syndrome]]. [[Mandated reporter]] training is a program used to prevent ongoing child abuse.

NICHD, also known as the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development is a broad organization, but helps victims of child abuse through one of its branches. Through the Child Development and Behavior (CDB) Branch, NICHD raises awareness efforts by supporting research projects to better understand the short- and long-term impacts of child abuse and neglect. They provide programs and observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month every April since 1984. The Children’s Bureau leads activities for the Month, including the release of updated statistics about child abuse and neglect, candlelight vigils, and fundraisers to support prevention activities and treatment for victims. The Bureau also sponsors a "Blue Ribbon Campaign," in which people wear blue ribbons in memory of children who have died from abuse, or in honor of individuals and organizations that have taken important steps to prevent child abuse and neglect.<ref>NICHD.
