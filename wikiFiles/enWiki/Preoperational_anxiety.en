'''Preoperational anxiety''' is a universal reaction experienced by patients who are admitted to the hospital for surgery. Just the initial idea of having surgical procedures can bring about very high levels of anxiety in patients.<ref name="#5">Pritchard, Michael John "Identifying and assessing anxiety in pre-operative patients." ''Nursing Standard'' 23.51 (2009): 35-40. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 29 September 2009.</ref> Preoperational anxiety can be described as an unpleasant state of tension or uneasiness that results from a patient's doubts or fears (from a vast array) before an operation.<ref name="#5" />

==Measuring Preoperational Anxiety==
The [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] (STAI) is a widespread method of measuring pre-operative anxiety for research. The STAI consists of two 20-item self-report scales that attempt to accurately measure the worry and apprehension based on both present circumstances and personality traits.<ref name="stai">Brown, Roger L., Audrey Tluczek, Jeffrey B. Henriques. “Support for the Reliability and Validity of a Six-Item State Anxiety Scale Derived From the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory”. ''Journal of Nursing Measurement'' (2009) Bnet. Web. 9 December 2009.</ref> Patients are asked to rate the frequency of particular symptoms.<ref name="stai" /><br />
<br />
The STAI was based on the theory that there are two different aspects of anxiety. This caused two different sections of the STAI to develop: the State scale (designed to measure the circumstantial or temporary arousal of anxiety), and the Trait scale (designed to measure the long-standing personality characteristics related to anxiety). The items on each scale are based on a two-factor model: anxiety present, anxiety absent.<ref name="stai" /><br />
<br />
In the 2009 Journal of Nursing Measurement, Tluczek, Henriques, and Brown mention that one of the problems with the STAI is that the fast-paced hospital environment makes it is difficult to get each patient through all 20 items, especially when there are other assessments that need to be done.<ref name="stai" /><br />
<br />
Recently, other people have tried to create shortened versions of the 20-item STAI. For example, Tluczek et al. (2009) have found that the Marteau and Bekker’s six-item version of the State Anxiety scale has “favorable internal consistency reliability and validity when correlated with the parent 20-item State scale”.<ref name="stai" />  Research on new and improved methods is sure to be continuing. Other alternatives for quick and accurate measurements may be found in the future.<ref name="stai" />

==Causes==

=== General Fears ===
Through the research done by several individuals, it is concluded that many different there are many different fears that can cause preoperational anxiety. These fears include:
# “the unknown”<ref name="#5" /> 
# surgical failure 
# [[anesthesia]]<ref name="#8">Bajaj, A. et al. “Pre-operative Anxiety” ''Anaethesia''. 51 (1996):344-346. EBSCO. Web. September 2009.</ref> 
# loss of personal identity 
# recuperation around strangers <ref name="#2" />
# pain<ref name="#5" />
# loss of control

# unsuccessful recovery <ref name="#5" />
# strange environment <ref name="#7" />

===General factors===
There are many different factors that play into the level of anxiety a patient might experience:
# Previous hospital experiences <ref name="#5" />
#Sociodemographic characteristics (such as age, marital status and education) <ref name= "#7" />
# Psychological characteristics (such as coping strategies and perceived social support) <ref name= "#7" />
# Gender (females tend to have higher levels of preoperational anxiety than males).<ref name="#7" />

Irving Janis separates the factor trends that are commonly seen affecting anxiety into three different levels:<ref name="book">Janis, Irving L. ''Psychological Stress: Psychoanalytic and Behavioral Studies of Surgical Patients''. Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley & Sons Inc, 1958. Web. Dec. 2009.</ref>

* '''Low anxiety''': This is seen among people with personality predispositions that incline a person to deny signs of impending dangers and ignore harsh warnings of medical personnel. This group also includes severe obsessionals, withdrawn [[schizoid]]al characters and patients with other avoidance disorders. Some of the patients that experience low levels of anxiety are emotional and responsive to their environment, but, if unpleasant information is given, there is an immediate shift to a moderate degree of apprehension.<ref name="book" />

* '''Moderate anxiety''': This is seen among people who are highly responsive to external stimulation. Usually, people in this group are greatly influenced by the information that is given to them. Information seems to have a positive influence on these people: potential dangers, how dangers are overcome, and protective factors help the patients grasp reality and overcome worry.<ref name="book" />

* '''High anxiety''': This is seen among patients with predispositions to suffer from [[neurosis|neurotic]] symptoms. It is also seen among patients who have an extremely hard time with the threat of body damage.<ref name="book" /> This includes those with repressed inner struggles that are brought out through the external threat.<ref name ="book" />

==Different reactions to preoperative anxiety==

=== Physiology ===

When anxiety alters the patient’s vital signs, it results in physiological responses such as [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], elevated temperature, sweating, nausea and a heightened sense of touch, smell or hearing.<ref name="#5" /><ref name="#8" /> <br />
A patient may also experience peripheral [[vasoconstriction]], which makes it difficult for the hospital staff to obtain blood from the individual.<ref name="#5" />

===Psychology===
Anxiety may cause behavioral and cognitive changes which can result in increased tension, apprehension, nervousness and aggression.<ref name="#5" /><br />
Some patients may become so nervous and apprehensive that they cannot understand or follow simple instructions. Some may be so aggressive and demanding that they require constant attention of the nursing staff.<ref name="#5" />

===Behavioral Strategies and Trends===
In research conducted by Irving Janis, common reactions and strategies were separated into three different levels of preoperational anxiety:<br />
1.	'''Low Anxiety'''<br />
Patients in this category tend to adopt a joking attitude or to say things like “there’s nothing to it!”  Because most pain is not preconceived by the patient, the patients tends to be blame their pain on the hospital staff.<ref name="book" /> In this case, the patient feels as if they have been mistreated. This is because the patient doesn't have the usual mindset that pain is an unavoidable result of an operation.<ref name="book" /><br />
<br />
	Other trends include displaying a calm and relaxed attitude during preoperative care. They don't usually experience any sleeping disturbances.<ref name="book" /> They also tend to make little effort to seek more information about medical procedures. This may be due to the fact that they are unaware of the potential threats, or it may just be because they have succeeded in shutting themselves out and eliminating all thought of doubt and fear.<ref name="book" /><br />
<br />
	The main concern that low anxiety patients tend to express is finances, and they usually deny apprehension about operational dangers.<ref name="book" />

2.	'''Moderate Anxiety'''<br />
Patients in this category may only experience minor emotional tension. The occasional worry or fear that is experienced by a patient with moderate anxiety can usually be suppressed.<ref name="book" /> <br />
<br />
	Some may suffer from [[insomnia]], but they also usually respond well to mild sedatives. Their outward manner may seem relatively calm and well controlled, except for small moments where it is apparent to others that the patient is suffering from an inner conflict. They can usually perform daily tasks, only becoming restless from time to time.<ref name="book" /><br />
<br />
	These patients are usually very motivated to develop reliable information from medical authority in order to reach a point of comfortable relief.<ref name="book" />

3.	'''High Anxiety'''<br />
Patients in this category will usually try to reassure themselves by seeking information, but these attempts, in the long-run, are unsuccessful at helping the patient reach a comfortable point because the fear is so dominant.<ref name="book"/> <br />
<br />
	It is common for patients in this level of anxiety to engage in mentally distracting activities in an attempt to get their mind off of anticipated danger. They have a hard time idealizing their situation or maintaining any sort of conception that things could turn out well in the end. This because they tend to dwell on improbable dangers.<ref name="book" />

==Effects==

=== Preparation for Surgery ===
On the positive side, if a patient experiences moderate amounts of anxiety, the anxiety can aid in the preparation for surgery.<ref name="#5" />  On the negative side, the anxiety can cause harm if the patient experiences an excessive or diminutive amount.  One reason for this is that small amounts of anxiety will not adequately prepare the patient for pain.<ref name="#5" /> Also, higher levels of anxiety can over-sensitize the patient to unpleasant stimuli, which would heighten their senses of touch, smell or hearing.  This results in intense pain, dizziness, and nausea. It can also increase the patient’s feelings of uneasiness in the unfamiliar surroundings.<ref name="#2">Carr, Eloise, et al. "Patterns and frequency of anxiety in women undergoing gynaecological surgery." ''Journal of Clinical Nursing'' 15.3 (2006): 341-352. Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition. EBSCO. Web. 8 September 2009.</ref>

===Post-Operation===
Anxiety has also been proven to cause higher [[analgesic]] and [[anaesthetic]] requirement, postoperative pain, and prolonged hospital stay.<ref name="#3">Agarwal, A., et al. "Acupressure for prevention of pre-operative anxiety: a prospective, randomised, placebo controlled study." ''Anaesthesia'' 60.10 (2005): 978-981. Biomedical Reference Collection: Basic. EBSCO. Web. 9 September 2009.</ref> <br />
<br />
Irving L. Janis describes the effect of preoperative aniety on postoperative reactions to by separating it into the three levels:<ref name="book" /><br />
<br />
1.	'''Low Anxiety''':. The defenses of denial and other reassurances that were created to ward off the worry and apprehension preoperatively are not effective long-term. When all the pain and stress is experienced post-operatively, the emotional tension is unrelieved because there aren’t any real reassurances available from the pre-operational stage.<ref name="book" />

2.	'''Moderate Anxiety''': Reality-oriented reassurances that were used to prepare a patient with moderate anxiety for an operation are stored in the patient’s memory, so they are available to aid in post-operational stress.<ref name="book" />

3.	'''High Anxiety''': Because the reassurances given by hospital personnel were not effective pre-operatively, there aren’t any real reassurances available to aid with the stress stimuli that are subsequently encountered.<ref name="book" />
