'''John Williams''' (1626/7 – 28 March 1673) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[nonconformist]] preacher and doctor.  He was said to be the first to introduce non-conformism to his home county of [[Caernarfonshire]], and it was also said that he could be heard when he was preaching for a distance of a quarter of a mile.

==Life==
Williams was born on the [[Llŷn peninsula]], in the parish of [[Llanbedrog]], [[Caernarfonshire]], north-west [[Wales]].  His father (a member of the minor [[gentry]]) was William Jones, with Williams obtaining a [[patronymic]] surname according to Welsh practice at that time.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web| url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66554|title= Williams, John (1626/7–1673)|last=Roberts|first=Stephen K. |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|format=subscription access|year= 2004 |accessdate=3 April 2009}}</ref>  At the age of 20, in 1647, he [[matriculation|matriculated]] at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] and studied medicine.  Thereafter, his movements until 1662 are uncertain: whilst it is known that he was a [[Puritan]] and took up preaching, the possibility that he was the "John Williams" who was the vicar of [[Llanbeblig]] from 1651 cannot be verified on the surviving information.<ref name=WBO/> Historians, however, differ on whether Williams was a chaplain in the army during some of this period.<ref name=Oxford/><ref name=WBO/>

Williams figured in a history of the Methodist revival in Wales, published in 1820 and based upon oral testimony.  He was said to be the first preacher to introduce non-conformity to Caernarfonshire, and it was also said that he could be heard preaching for a distance of a quarter of a mile.<ref name=Oxford/>  In 1662, he was arrested for his preaching in Caernarfonshire, leaving for London after his release, where he became the chaplain of a Puritan noble in [[Kent]].<ref name=Oxford/><ref name=WBO/>  In the following year, he was accused of writing a treasonable letter (which spoke of the sufferings of the non-conformists and hoped that God would arm those fearing him, which was perhaps intended metaphorically rather than literally) and a warrant was issued in Caernarfonshire for his arrest.<ref name=Oxford/><ref name=WBO/>  He gave himself up to the authorities in London, and was acquitted after spending 10 weeks in prison.  He then returned to Caernarfonshire and worked as a physician, with his house being registered as a non-conformist meeting-house in 1672.  [[Henry Maurice]]{{dn|date=November 2011}} rebuked him twice in 1672 for not preaching enough and "neglecting the work of the Lord", but Williams defended himself.  He died on 28 March 1673, and was buried in [[Llangian]], with his tombstone referring in its Latin epigraph to his dual role as minister and doctor.<ref name=WBO>{{cite web|url= http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WILL-JOH-1627.html|title= Williams, John (1627–1673), early Nonconformist preacher, and physician|last=Jenkins|first=Robert Thomas|authorlink=Robert Thomas Jenkins|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|year=2007|accessdate=3 April 2009}}</ref>
