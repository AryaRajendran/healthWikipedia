The '''Blue Cross Blue Shield Association''' ('''BCBSA''') is a federation of 38 separate health insurance organizations and companies in the United States. Combined, they directly or indirectly provide health insurance to over 99 million Americans.<ref>[http://www.bcbs.com/about-the-association/ Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association &mdash; About Us]</ref>  The history of Blue Cross dates back to 1929, while the history of Blue Shield dates to 1939.  The Blue Cross Association dates back to 1960, while its Blue Shield counterpart was created in 1948.  The two organizations merged in 1982, forming the current association.

{{Further|History of insurance}}
{{hus}}
Blue Cross and Blue Shield developed separately, with Blue Cross plans providing coverage for hospital services, while Blue Shield covered physicians' services.<ref name=IRSConversion/>

'''Blue Cross''' is a name used by an association of [[health insurance]] plans throughout the [[United States]]. Its predecessor was developed by [[Justin Ford Kimball]] in 1929, while he was vice-president of [[Baylor University]]'s health care facilities in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref name="hbtx">{{Handbook of Texas | id=KK/fki9 | name=Justin Ford Kimball| retrieved=August 31, 2009}}</ref>  The first plan guaranteed teachers 21 days of hospital care for $6 a year, and was later extended to other employee groups in Dallas, and then nationally.<ref name="hbtx"/> The [[American Hospital Association]] (AHA) adopted the Blue Cross symbol in 1939 as the emblem for plans meeting certain standards. In 1960 the AHA commission was superseded by the Blue Cross Association.  Affiliation with the AHA was severed in 1972. 

The '''Blue Shield''' concept was developed at the beginning of the 20th century by employers in lumber and mining camps of the Pacific Northwest to provide medical care by paying monthly fees to medical service bureaus composed of groups of physicians.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bcbs.com/about/history/blue-beginnings.html| title=History of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association &mdash; Blue Beginnings | publisher=Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association}}</ref>  The first official Blue Shield Plan was founded in California in 1939.  In 1948 the symbol was informally adopted by nine plans called the Associated Medical Care Plan, and was later renamed the National Association of Blue Shield Plans. 

In 1982 Blue Shield merged with [[Blue Cross|The Blue Cross Association]] to form the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bcbs.com/about/history/1980s.html| title=History of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association &mdash; 1980s | publisher=Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association}}</ref> 

Prior to the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], organizations administering Blue Cross Blue Shield were tax exempt under [[501(c)]](4) as social welfare plans. However, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 revoked that exemption because the plans sold commercial-type insurance. They became [[501(m)]] organizations, subject to federal taxation but entitled to "special tax benefits"<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.consumersunion.org/conv/nonprofit_health_inc/tax_status/blue_cross/index.html| title=Blue Cross: 501(m) | publisher=[[Consumers Union]] | quote=As of January 1, 1987, the federal government removed the full tax-exempt status of BCBS plans and instead created a special tax class for BCBS organizations, Internal Revenue Code ("I.R.C.") 5833. The new I.R.C. category subjected BCBS plans to federal taxation but recognized the unique role BCBS plans play. Under I.R.C. 5833 the BCBS plans, unlike commercial for-profit insurers, are entitled to special tax benefits.}}</ref> under IRC 833.<ref>http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000833----000-.html</ref>  In 1994, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association changed to allow its licensees to be for-profit corporations.<ref name=IRSConversion>IRS. [http://www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=183646,00.html Coordinated Issue Paper - Blue Cross Blue Shield/Health Insurance; Life Insurance: Conversion of nonprofit corporations]. (Effective Date:  June 4, 2008)</ref> Some plans{{specify|date=March 2011}} are still considered not-for-profit at the state level.

==Current organization==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2009}}
'''Blue Cross''' and '''Blue Shield''' insurance companies are [[licensee]]s, independent of the association (and traditionally of each other), offering insurance plans within defined regions under one or both of the association's brands.  Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers offer some form of health insurance coverage in every [[U.S. state]]. They also act as administrators of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in many states or regions of the US<ref>http://www.healthharbor.com</ref> and provide coverage to state government employees as well as to the federal government employees under a nationwide option of the [[Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan]].<ref>[http://www.opm.gov/insure/health/planinfo/2010/states/wy.asp United States Office of Personal Management, 2010 Nationwide Fee-for-Service Open to All]</ref>

The 14-state [[WellPoint]] is the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield member, and is a [[stock exchange|publicly traded]] company. Other multi-state organizations include CareFirst in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[The Regence Group]] in the Pacific Northwest.  The largest non-investor owned member is [[Health Care Service Corporation]],{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} which operates four Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans in the Midwest and Southwest (Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico).

The association has its headquarters in the [[Michigan Plaza]] complex in the [[Chicago Loop]] area of Chicago, Illinois.<ref>"[http://www.bcbs.com/about/contact/ Contact Us]." Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Retrieved on December 23, 2009.</ref>

==Details on specific organizations==
{{expand section|date=August 2009}}

===Idaho===
BlueCross of Idaho and Regence<ref>The Regence Group</ref> BlueShield of Idaho are separate companies and compete head to head throughout the state.

===North Carolina===
In the past Blue Cross Blue Shield has been sued and fined for denying due medical treatments to its customers and for underpaying doctors.<ref name="mediamatters">{{cite web| title=BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina's Desperate Attempt to Deceive | publisher=[[Media Matters for America]] | date=May 19, 2009 | url=http://mediamattersaction.org/factcheck/200905190001}}</ref> BCBSNC has also come under fire for a failed attempt to convert to for-profit status in 2003, a year in which it posted a record profit of $196 million and most customers saw their rates rise by more than 10%.<ref name="WRAL">{{cite web| title=BCBSNC Profits Continue To Go Up; So Do Customers' Premiums | publisher=[[WRAL-TV]] |date=March 8, 2004 | url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/109348/}}</ref>

In May 2009, BCBS licensee, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, readied an ad campaign against the introduction of  the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], legislation to be introduced to Congress by President [[Barack Obama]], although the BCBSNC CEO said that the company was in favor of reforming the current system.<ref name="charobserver">"BCBSNC ready to help shape health care reform," ''Charlotte Observer'', June 10, 2009 http://www.charlotteobserver.com/408/story/771829.html</ref>

===Pennsylvania===
Though historically "Blue Cross" was used for hospital coverage while "Blue Shield" was used for medical coverage, today that split only exists for traditional health insurance plans in eastern Pennsylvania, where Independence Blue Cross (Philadelphia) and Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania each have joint marketing agreements with Highmark Blue Shield (Pittsburgh) for their separate hospital and medical plans.  However, Independence Blue Cross, like most of its sister Blue Cross-Blue Shield companies, cover most of their customers under managed care plans such as HMOs and PPOs which provide hospital and medical care in one policy.

==Criticism and controversy==
The [[Seattle Times]] published an article on February 9, 2012, alleging non-profit insurance outfits, including [[Premera Blue Cross]], [[Regence BlueShield]] and [[Group Health Cooperative]], are stockpiling billions of dollars in reserves while increasing their rates at the same time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2017460805_surplus09m.html | work=The Seattle Times | first=Carol M. | last=Ostrom | title=3 Big Health Insurers Stockpile $2.4 Billion As Rates Keep Rising | date=February 8, 2012}}</ref>
Insurance companies do have [[statutory reserve]] requirements set by the states in which they operate, but the Seattle Times article cites Washington state insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler arguing that these companies have in excess of $1 billion more than needed to cover claims and disaster contingencies.
