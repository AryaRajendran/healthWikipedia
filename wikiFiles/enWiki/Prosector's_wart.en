'''Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis''' (also known as "Lupus verrucosus,"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=Chapter 74 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> "Prosector's wart,"<ref name="Bolognia" /> and "Warty tuberculosis"<ref name="Bolognia" />)is a [[rash]] of small, red papular nodules in the [[skin]] that may appear 2-4 weeks after inoculation by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in a previously infected and immunocompetent individual. 

It is so called because it was a common [[occupational disease]] of [[prosector]]s, the preparers of [[dissection]]s and [[autopsy|autopsies]]. Reinfection by [[tuberculosis]] via the skin, therefore, can result from accidental exposure to human tuberculous tissue in [[physician]]s, [[pathologist]]s and laboratory workers; or to tissues of other infected animals, in [[veterinarian]]s, [[butcher]]s, etc. Other names given to this form of skin tuberculosis are '''anatomist's wart''' and '''verruca necrogenica''' (literally, generated by corpses). 

TVC is one of the many forms of cutaneous [[tuberculosis]], such as the '''tuberculous chancre''' (which results from the inoculation in people without immunity, and the '''reactivation cutaneous tuberculosis''' (the most common one, which appears in previously infected patients). Other forms of [[cutaneous tuberculosis]] are: [[lupus vulgaris]], [[scrofuloderma]], [[lichen scrofulosorum]], [[erythema induratum]] and the [[papulonecrotic tuberculid]].

It was described by [[René Laennec]] in 1826.<ref name="pmid15015840">{{cite journal |author=Tigoulet F, Fournier V, Caumes E |title=[Clinical forms of the cutaneous tuberculosis] |language=French |journal=Bull Soc Pathol Exot |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=362–7 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=15015840 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

== Presentation ==
Because the TVC's entry point usually is the site of a [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[wound]] or puncture in the skin (during an autopsy, for example), the most frequent site for the wart are the [[hand]]s. But it can occur anywhere in the skin, such as in the sole of the feet, in the [[anus]], and, in the case of children from [[developing country|developing countries]], in the [[buttocks]] and [[knee]]s. This is because children from countries of high incidence of tuberculosis can contract the lesion after contact with tuberculous [[sputum]], by walking barefoot, sitting or playing on the ground. 

When recent, the skin lesion has the outside appearance of a [[wart]] or verruca, thus it can be confused with other kinds of warts. It evolves to an annular red-brown plaque with time, with central healing and gradual expansion in the periphery. In this phase, it can be confused with [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]s such as [[blastomycosis]] and [[chromoblastomycosis]].

== Diagnosis ==
The [[diagnosis]] is confirmed by a skin [[biopsy]] and a positive culture for [[acid-fast bacilli]]. A [[PPD test]] may also result positive.

== Treatment ==
Therapy for cutaneous tuberculosis is the same as for systemic tuberculosis, and usually consists of a 4-drug regimen, i.e., [[isoniazid]], [[rifampin]], [[pyrazinamide]], and [[ethambutol]] or [[streptomycin]].
