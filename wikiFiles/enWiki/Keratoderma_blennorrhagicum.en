Keratoderma blennorrhagicum is commonly seen as an additional feature of [[reactive arthritis]] in almost 15% of male patients. The appearance is usually of a vesico-pustular waxy lesion with a yellow brown colour. These lesions may join together to form larger crusty plaques with desquamating edges.
