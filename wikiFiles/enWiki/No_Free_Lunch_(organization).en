'''No Free Lunch''' is a [[United States|US]]-based advocacy organization that holds that [[marketing]] methods employed by drug companies influence the way doctors and other healthcare providers prescribe [[medication]]s.<ref name="careerfocus">Tayal U (2004-05-15), [http://careerfocus.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/328/7449/199.pdf ''No free lunch]. ''BMJ Careers''.  Retrieved on 2007-10-06.</ref> The group does outreach to convince physicians to refuse to accept gifts, money, or hospitality from pharmaceutical companies because it claims that these gifts create a [[conflict of interest]] for providers. The group also advocates for less involvement of drug companies in medical education and practice in a variety of other ways.

==History==
The organization was founded in 2000 by Bob Goodman,<ref name="O'Reilly">O'Reilly KB (2006-01-16), [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2006/01/16/prsa0116.htm Buy your own lunch: No chance of reciprocity: One doctor's crusade against gifts from the drug industry has grown into a small, but vocal, group].

The group made news in 2005 when the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] refused to rent exhibition space to No Free Lunch for its annual scientific assembly. A spokesperson for the academy argued that the dialog between physicians and exhibitors is "important and healthy" and that No Free Lunch seeks to eliminate that dialog.<ref name="Lenzer">Lenzer J (2005-09-24), [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7518/653-a/DC1 Doctors refuse exhibit space to group campaigning against drug company influence].

The [[American College of Physicians]] also refused to rent exhibit space to No Free Lunch at its Annual Session,<ref name="Lenzer"/> citing an event in 2001, in which a person claiming to represent No Free Lunch escorted investigative journalists with a hidden camera onto the exhibit floor.<ref name="ACP"/>

In collaboration with the [[American Medical Student Association]], No Free Lunch organized a "pharmfree campaign," in which medical students and others discuss issues of pharmaceutical company involvement in the medical community.<ref>Becker K (2004-12-08), [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/17490.php Medical students declare 'pharmfree day' to combat biased industry temptations].

==Advocacy==
The group tries to get healthcare providers to sign the '''No Free Lunch pledge'''. Health care professionals who take the pledge agree to:
<blockquote>accept no money, gifts, or hospitality from the pharmaceutical industry; to seek unbiased sources of information and not rely on information disseminated by drug companies; and to avoid conflicts of interest in [their] practice, teaching, and/or research.<ref>[http://www.nofreelunch.org/pledge.htm The No Free Lunch pledge]. No Free Lunch website. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.</ref> </blockquote>  {{As of|2004}}, the pledge had about 300 signers. Patients can use a directory provided by the group to find doctors who have taken the pledge.<ref name="victory"/>

The group claims that doctors preferentially prescribe drugs that are marketed to them over better or cheaper options because they are beholden to drug companies from which they accept gifts.<ref name="Koerner">Koerner BI (March/April, 2003), [http://www.motherjones.com/news/hellraiser/2003/03/ma_290_01.html Dr. No Free Lunch].

No Free Lunch also argues that doctors should not accept [[Pharmaceutical marketing#Free samples|drug sample]]s from drug companies to give to patients because the group believes that the samples will cause the doctors to prescribe those drugs over others.<ref>Yamey G (2001-01-13),

The group also seeks to convince physicians not to rely on research provided by drug companies for their information about drugs but to base their decisions only on impartial scientific evidence.<ref name="O'Reilly"/> No free lunch works with an Australian group called [[Healthy Skepticism]] to urge doctors to rely on independent educational materials rather than materials paid for by drug companies for their drug information.<ref>[[Ray Moynihan]] (2003-05-31), [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1126054 Who pays for the pizza?

The group also calls for less involvement of drug companies in the funding of medical education.<ref>[[Ray Moynihan]] (2003-05-31).

No Free Lunch does not blame drug companies for trying to market their products; the group feels that that is the companies' job.<ref name="victory">Victory J (2004-05-04), [http://www.specprom.com/article.html Fighting freebies]. ''The Journal News''. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.</ref>   Rather, it believes that physicians are allowing themselves to be courted and swayed by advertisers.<ref name="victory"/>

=== Pharmaceutical industry meetings ===
No Free Lunch argues that educational meetings that take place during meals paid for by drug companies constitute an advertising method known as [[direct-to-physician marketing]], in which a drug company representative interacts with doctors and provides them with promotional information.<ref name="victory"/> 

The [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]], a group that represents all major drug companies in the US, argues that meetings between drug representatives and doctors are an important way to educate doctors about their products, and that purchasing meals for doctors may be the only opportunity to fit such meetings into the physicians' busy schedules.<ref name="victory"/>
