The '''anterior fascial compartment of thigh''' contains the [[knee]] [[extensors]] and [[hip]] [[flexors]]. 

It contains the following five muscles:<ref name="isbn0-7817-5484-4">{{cite book |author=Sauerland, Eberhardt K.; Patrick W., PhD.

The muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh (as well as the [[pectineus]] of the medial compartment) are innervated by the [[femoral nerve]]. Though the [[iliopsoas]] is sometimes considered a member of the anterior compartment muscles,<ref name="titleSummary of Lower Limb"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Ellis, Harold; Susan Standring; Gray, Henry David |title=Gray's anatomy: the anatomical basis of clinical practice |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages=518 |isbn=0-443-07168-3 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> the [[iliacus]] and the [[psoas]] portions do not share the same innervation. Whereas the [[iliacus]] is innervated by the femoral nerve, the psoas is innervated by ventral rami of L1-L3. Notably, the [[articularis genu muscle|articularis genu]] is also sometimes included in the anterior compartment group.<ref name="titleSummary of Lower Limb">{{cite web |url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/WNOR/summarylistll.htm |title=Summary of Lower Limb |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080123061508/http://mywebpages.comcast.net/WNOR/summarylistll.htm| archivedate= 23 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
