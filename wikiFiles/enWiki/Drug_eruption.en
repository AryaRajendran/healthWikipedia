In [[medicine]], a '''drug eruption''' is an [[adverse drug reaction]] of the [[Human skin|skin]]. Most drug-induced cutaneous reactions are mild and disappear when the offending drug is withdrawn.<ref name="pmid7762478">{{cite journal |author=Manders SM |title=Serious and life-threatening drug eruptions |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=1865–72 |year=1995 |month=June |pmid=7762478 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Drugs can also cause [[hair disease|hair]] and [[nail disease|nail]] changes, affect the [[mucous membranes]], or cause [[itching]] without outward skin changes.<ref name="pmid17973540"/>

==Diagnosis==
Drug eruptions are diagnosed mainly from the [[medical history]] and [[clinical examination]]. However, they can mimic a wide range of other conditions, thus delaying diagnosis (for example, in [[drug-induced lupus erythematosus]], or the [[acne]]-like rash caused by [[erlotinib]]). A [[skin biopsy]], [[blood test]]s or [[immunology|immunological]] tests can also be useful. If the causative agent can not be withdrawn, the symptoms should be relieved as much as possible.

It is estimated that 2—3 percent of hospitalised patients are affected by a drug eruption, and that serious drug eruptions occur in around 1 in 1000 patients.<ref name="pmid7794310">{{cite journal |author=Roujeau JC, Stern RS |title=Severe adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=331 |issue=19 |pages=1272–85 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7794310 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199411103311906|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=7794310&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref>

==Classification==
The drug eruption can be an expected adverse effect or an unexpected effect ([[idiosyncratic]]). 

Some of the most severe and life-threatening examples of drug eruptions are [[erythema multiforme]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[hypersensitivity vasculitis]], [[DRESS syndrome]], [[erythroderma]] and [[exanthematous pustulosis]].

===By appearance===
The most common type of eruption is a [[morbilliform]] (resembling [[measles]]) or [[erythematous rash]], but the appearance may also be [[urticaria]]l, [[papulosquamous disorder|papulosquamous]], [[pustular rash|pustular]], [[purpura|purpuric]], [[bullous]] (with blisters) or [[lichenoid eruption|lichenoid]].<ref name="pmid17973540">{{cite journal |author=Valeyrie-Allanore L, Sassolas B, Roujeau JC |title=Drug-induced skin, nail and hair disorders |journal=Drug Saf |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1011–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17973540 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200730110-00003|url=}}</ref> [[Angioedema]] can also be drug-induced (most notably, by [[angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors]]).

===By mechanism===
The underlying mechanism can be immunological (such as in [[drug allergy|drug allergie]]s) or non-immunological (for example, in [[photodermatitis]] or as a side effect of [[anticoagulants]]). A [[fixed drug eruption]] is the term for a drug eruption that occurs in the same skin area every time the person is exposed to the drug. Eruptions can occur frequently with a certain drug (for example, with [[phenytoin]]<ref name="pmid12952753">{{cite journal |author=Scheinfeld N |title=Phenytoin in cutaneous medicine: its uses, mechanisms and side effects |journal=Dermatol. Online J. |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=6 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12952753 |doi= |url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/93/reviews/dilantin/scheinfeld.html}}</ref>), or be very rare (for example, [[Sweet's syndrome]] following the administration of [[colony-stimulating factor]]s<ref name="pmid17655751">{{cite journal |author=Cohen PR |title=Sweet's syndrome--a comprehensive review of an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=2 |issue= |pages=34 |year=2007 |pmid=17655751 |pmc=1963326 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-34 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/2//34}}</ref>).

===By drug===
The culprit can be both a [[prescription drug]] or an [[over-the-counter medication]]. 

Examples of common drugs causing drug eruptions are [[antibiotic]]s and other [[antimicrobial]] drugs, [[sulfa drugs]], [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[chemotherapy]] agents, [[anticonvulsants]], and [[psychotropic drugs]]. Common examples include photodermatitis due to local NSAIDs (such as [[piroxicam]]) or due to antibiotics (such as [[minocycline]]), and the rash following [[ampicillin]] in cases of [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]].
