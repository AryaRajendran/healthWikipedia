'''''Giardia lamblia''''' is a [[flagellate]]d [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]] that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing [[giardiasis]]. The parasite attaches to the [[epithelium]] by a [[ventral]] adhesive disc, and reproduces via [[binary fission]].<ref>Oxford textbook of Medicine, Fourth Edition, Volume 1 (2003) ''Oxford University Press'' pp.759-760 ISBN 0-19-262922-0</ref> Giardiasis does not spread via the bloodstream, nor does it spread to other parts of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], but remains confined to the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the small intestine.<ref>Harrison's Internal Medicine, Harrison's Online Chapter 199 ''Protozoal intestinal infections and trochomoniasis''</ref> ''Giardia'' [[trophozoite]]s absorb their nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine, and are [[anaerobe]]s.  If the organism is split and stained, its characteristic pattern resembles the familiar "smiley face" symbol. Chief pathways of human infection include ingestion of untreated sewage, a phenomenon particularly common in many developing countries;<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Water_pollution ''Water pollution''. Encyclopedia of Earth]. eds. Mark McGinley and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC.</ref> contamination of natural waters also occurs in watersheds where intensive grazing occurs.

==Hosts==
''Giardia'' infects humans, but is also one of the most common parasites infecting cats, dogs and birds. Mammalian hosts also include cattle, [[beaver]]s, [[deer]], and sheep.

==Transmission==
''Giardia'' infection can occur through ingestion of dormant [[microbial cyst]]s in contaminated water, food, or by the [[faecal-oral route]] (through poor hygiene practices). The cyst can survive for weeks to months in cold water,<ref name="Huang">{{Cite journal|author=Huang DB, White AC |title=An updated review on Cryptosporidium and Giardia |journal=Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=291–314, viii |year=2006 |pmid=16880067 |doi=10.1016/j.gtc.2006.03.006}}</ref> so can be present in contaminated wells and water systems, especially stagnant water sources, such as naturally occurring ponds, storm water storage systems, and even clean-looking mountain streams. They may also occur in city reservoirs and persist after water treatment, as the cysts are resistant to conventional water treatment methods, such as [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[ozonolysis]].<ref name="Huang" /> [[Zoonotic]] transmission is also possible, so ''Giardia'' infection is a concern for people camping in the wilderness or swimming in contaminated streams or lakes, especially the artificial lakes formed by [[beaver]] dams (hence the popular name for giardiasis, "beaver fever").

In addition to waterborne sources, fecal-oral transmission can also occur, for example in day-care centers, where children may have poor hygiene practices. Those who work with children are also at risk of being infected, as are family members of infected individuals. Not all ''Giardia'' infections are symptomatic, and many people can unknowingly serve as carriers of the parasite.

==Life cycle==
[[File:Giardia life cycle en.svg|right|thumb|Life cycle of ''Giardia lamblia'']]

The life cycle begins with a noninfective cyst being excreted with the faeces of an infected individual. The cyst is hardy, providing protection from various degrees of heat and cold, [[desiccation]], and infection from other organisms. A distinguishing characteristic of the cyst is four nuclei and a retracted cytoplasm. Once ingested by a host, the trophozoite emerges to an active state of feeding and motility.
After the feeding stage, the trophozoite undergoes asexual replication through longitudinal binary fission. The resulting trophozoites and cysts then pass through the digestive system in the faeces. While the trophozoites may be found in the faeces, only the cysts are capable of surviving outside of the host.

Distinguishing features of the trophozoites are large [[karyosome]]s and lack of peripheral [[chromatin]], giving the two nuclei a halo appearance. Cysts are distinguished by a retracted cytoplasm. This protozoan lacks [[mitochondria]], although the discovery of the presence of mitochodrial remnants ([[organelles]]) in one recent study "indicate that ''Giardia'' is not primitively amitochondrial and that it has retained a functional organelle derived from the original mitochondrial endosymbiont".<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Tovar J |title=Mitochondrial remnant organelles of Giardia function in iron-sulphur protein maturation |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6963 |pages=172–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14614504 |doi=10.1038/nature01945|author-separator=,|author2=León-Avila G|author3=Sánchez LB|display-authors=3|last4=Sutak|first4=Robert|last5=Tachezy|first5=Jan|last6=Van Der Giezen|first6=Mark|last7=Hernández|first7=Manuel|last8=Müller|first8=Miklós|last9=Lucocq|first9=John M.}}</ref> This organelle is now termed a [[mitosome]].

==Intracellular metabolism and biochemistry==
''Giardia'' relies on [[glucose]] as its major energy source and breaks glucose down into ethanol, acetate and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Giardia |title=Giardia - MicrobeWiki |publisher=Microbewiki.kenyon.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> However, it can also use [[arginine]] as an energy source.<ref name=pmid9504342>{{Cite journal|author=Brown DM, Upcroft JA, Edwards MR, Upcroft P |title=Anaerobic bacterial metabolism in the ancient eukaryote Giardia duodenalis |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=149–64 |year=1998 |pmid=9504342 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(97)00172-0 |url=http://www.mitochondrial.net/showabstract.php?pmid=9504342}}</ref> ''Giardia'' possesses unique biochemical pathways that suggest it diverged from other [[eukaryotes]] at an early stage in [[evolution]].<ref name=pmid9504342/>

B vitamins and bile salts, as well as glucose, are necessary for ''Giardia'' to survive, and a low-carbohydrate diet was shown in mice to reduce the number of ''Giardia'' organisms present.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Giardia and Giardiasis |last1=Erlandsen |last2=Meyer |isbn=0-306-41539-9 |year=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

==Manifestation of infection==

[[Image:Giardiasis duodenum high.jpg|thumb|'''Giardiasis''' on a [[duodenum|duodenal]] [[biopsy]].]]
Nomenclature of ''Giardia'' species is difficult, as humans and animals appear to have morphologically identical parasites.

Colonization of the gut results in inflammation and villous atrophy, reducing the gut's absorptive capability. In humans, infection is symptomatic only about 50% of the time, and protocol for treating asymptomatic individuals is controversial.<ref name="Huang" /> Symptoms of infection include (in order of frequency) diarrhea, [[malaise]], excessive gas (often flatulence or a foul or sulphuric-tasting belch, which has been known to be so nauseating in taste that it can cause the infected person to vomit), [[steatorrhoea]] (pale, foul smelling, greasy stools), epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, diminished interest in food, possible (but rare) vomiting which is often violent, and weight loss.<ref name="Huang" /> Pus, mucus and blood are occasionally present in the stool. It usually causes "explosive diarrhea" and while unpleasant, is not fatal. In healthy individuals, the condition is usually self-limiting, although the infection can be prolonged in patients who are immunocompromised, or who have decreased gastric acid secretion.<ref name="Huang" />

People with recurring ''Giardia'' infections, particularly those with a lack of the [[immunoglobulin A]] antibody, may develop chronic disease.

[[Lactose intolerance|Lactase deficiency]] may develop in an infection with ''Giardia'', but this usually does not persist for more than a few weeks, and a full recovery is the norm.<ref>Ish-Horowicz M, Korman SH, Shapiro M, Har-Even U, Tamir I, Strauss N, Deckelbaum RJ (1989).  Asymptomatic giardiasis in children. Pediatr Infect Dis J 8(11):773-779. PMID: 2512565</ref>

Some studies have shown giardiasis should be considered as a cause of [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]] as result of the problems caused within the intestinal absorption system.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.1986.tb01127.x|author=Cordingley FT, Crawford GP |title=Giardia infection causes vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Medicine |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=78–9 |year=1986 |pmid=3458451}}</ref>

==Treatment and diagnosis==
''G. lamblia'' infection in humans is frequently misdiagnosed. Accurate diagnosis requires an antigen test or, if that is unavailable, an ova and parasite examination of stool. Multiple stool examinations are recommended, since the cysts and trophozoites are not shed consistently. Given the difficult nature of testing to find the infection, including many false negatives, some patients should be treated on the basis of [[empirical evidence]], treating based on symptoms.<ref>Curtis, Rick. "[http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/safety/giarlyme.shtml Outdoor Action Guide to Giardia, Lyme Disease and other 'post trip' Illnesses]." ''Outdoor Action,'' 2005-2008.</ref>

Human infection is conventionally treated with [[metronidazole]], [[tinidazole]] or [[nitazoxanide]]. Although metronidazole is the current first-line therapy, it is [[mutagenic]] in bacteria and [[carcinogenic]] in mice, so should be avoided during pregnancy.<ref name="Huang" /> It has not directly been linked to causing cancer in humans, only in other mammals, therefore appears safe. One of the most common alternative treatments is [[berberine sulfate]] (found in [[Oregon grape root]], [[goldenseal]], [[yellowroot]], and various other plants).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} [[Berberine]] has been shown to have an [[antimicrobial]] and an [[antipyretic]] effect.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kaneda Y, Tanaka T, Saw T |title=Effects of berberine, a plant alkaloid, on the growth of anaerobic protozoa in axenic culture |journal=The Tokai Journal of Experimental and Clinical Medicine |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=417–23 |year=1990 |pmid=2131648}}</ref> Berberine compounds cause [[uterine]] stimulation, and so should be avoided in pregnancy.

===Treatment in animals===
Cats can be cured easily and lambs usually simply lose weight, but in calves, the parasites can be fatal and often are not responsive to antibiotics or electrolytes. Carriers among calves can also be asymptomatic.  This parasite is deadly for [[chinchillas]], so extra care must be taken by providing them with safe water.  Dogs have a high infection rate, as 30% of the population under one year old are known to be infected in [[kennels]]. The infection is more prevalent in puppies than in adult dogs. Infected dogs can be isolated and treated, or the entire pack at a kennel can be treated together regardless. Kennels should also be then cleaned with bleach or other cleaning disinfectants. The grass areas used for exercise should be considered contaminated for at least one month after dogs show signs of infection, as cysts can survive in the environment for long periods of time. Prevention can be achieved by [[quarantine]] of infected dogs for at least 20 days and careful management and maintenance of a clean water supply.

==Microscopy==

Under a normal compound light [[microscope]], ''Giardia'' often looks like a "clown face," with two nuclei outlined by adhesive discs above dark [[median bodies]] that form the "mouth." Cysts are oval, have four nuclei, and have clearly visible [[axostyle]]s.
In spite of the common belief that all eukaryotes have [[mitochondria]], ''Giardia'' is one of the few to lack these [[organelles]].

==Research==
''Giardia'' alternates between two different forms &mdash; a hardy, dormant [[microbial cyst|cyst]] that contaminates water or food, and an active, disease-causing form that emerges after the parasite is ingested. <!--[[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] grantee -->Dr. Frances Gillin of the [[University of California, San Diego]] and her colleagues cultivated the entire life cycle of this [[parasite]] in the laboratory, and identified biochemical cues in the host's digestive system which trigger ''Giardia'''s life cycle transformations.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hetsko ML, McCaffery JM, Svärd SG, Meng TC, Que X, Gillin FD |title=Cellular and transcriptional changes during excystation of Giardia lamblia in vitro |journal=Experimental Parasitology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=172–83 |year=1998 |pmid=9562420 |doi=10.1006/expr.1998.4246}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Svärd SG, Meng TC, Hetsko ML, McCaffery JM, Gillin FD |title=Differentiation-associated surface antigen variation in the ancient eukaryote ''Giardia lamblia'' |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=979–89 |year=1998 |pmid=9988475 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.01125.x}}</ref> They also uncovered several ways in which the parasite evades the defences of the infected organism. One of these is by altering the [[protein]]s on its surface, which confounds the ability of the infected animal's [[immune system]] to detect and combat the parasite (called [[antigenic variation]]). Gillin's work reveals why ''Giardia'' infections are extremely persistent and prone to recur. In addition, these insights into its biology and survival techniques may enable scientists to develop better strategies to understand, prevent, and treat ''Giardia'' infections.

In December 2008, Nature published an article showing the discovery of an RNA interference mechanism that allows ''Giardia'' to switch variant-specific surface proteins to avoid host immune response. The discovery was made by the team working at the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Medicine, Catholic University of Cordoba, Argentina, led by Dr. Hugo Lujan.

==Genomics==
''Giardia'' and the other [[diplomonad]]s are unique in their possession of two [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] that are similar in appearance, DNA content, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and time of replication. There are five chromosomes per the haploid genome.
The genome has been sequenced and was published in 2007, although the sequence contains several gaps. The sequence is about 12 million base pairs and contains about 5000 protein-coding genes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Morrison HG |title=Genomic minimalism in the early diverging intestinal parasite ''Giardia lamblia'' |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5846 |pages=1921–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17901334 |doi=10.1126/science.1143837|author-separator=,|author2=McArthur AG|author3=Gillin FD|display-authors=3|last4=Aley|first4=S.

[[Trophozoite]]s have a [[ploidy]] of four and the ploidy of cysts is eight, which in turn raises the question of how ''Giardia'' maintains homogeneity between the chromosomes of the same and opposite nuclei.

''Giardia'' had been assumed to be primitively asexual and with no means of transferring DNA between nuclei. These assumptions made it very difficult to explain the remarkably low level of allelic heterozygosity (< 0.01%) in the genome isolate, WB. However, all those assumptions of asexuality are now in doubt, with population genetics providing evidence for recombination<ref>Cooper MA, Adam RD, Worobey M, Sterling CR (2007). Population genetics provides evidence for recombination in Giardia. Curr Biol 17(22):1984-1988.

These findings on sexuality in ''Giardia'', above, have important implications for understanding the origin of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.  Even though sexual reproduction is widespread among extant eukaryotes, it seemed unlikely, until recently, that sex is a primordial and fundamental feature of eukaryotes.  A probable reason for the view that sex may not be fundamental to eukaryotes was that sexual reproduction previously appeared to be lacking in certain human pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes (e.g. ''Giardia'') that diverged from early ancestors in the eukaryotic lineage.  

In addition to the evidence cited above for recombination in ''Giardia'', Malik et al.<ref name=Malik>Malik SB, Pightling AW, Stefaniak LM, Schurko AM, Logsdon JM Jr (2007). An expanded inventory of conserved meiotic genes provides evidence for sex in Trichomonas vaginalis. PLoS One 3(8):e2879. PMID: 18663385</ref> reported that many meiosis specific genes occur in the ''Giardia'' genome, and further that homologs of these genes also occur in another unicellular eukaryote, ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]''.  Because these two species are descendants of lineages that are highly divergent among eukaryotes, Malik et al.<ref name=Malik /> suggested that these meiotic genes were present in a common ancestor of all eukaryotes.  Thus, on this view, the earliest ancestor of eukaryotes was likely capable of sexual reproduction.  Furthermore, Dacks and Roger <ref>Dacks J, Roger AJ (1999). The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex. J Mol Evol 48(6):779-783. PMID: 10229582</ref> proposed, based on phylogenetic analysis, that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.  Bernstein et al. also reviewed evidence in support of this view.<ref>Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2012). DNA repair as the primary adaptive function of sex in bacteria and eukaryotes.  Chapter 1: pp.1-49 in: DNA Repair: New Research, Sakura Kimura and Sora Shimizu editors. Nova Sci. Publ., Hauppauge, N.Y.

Seven genotypes of ''Giardia'' have been recognized to date (A-G). Of these, B is the most widespread. Only types A and B have been shown to be infectious to humans.

==History==
The [[trophozoite]] form of ''Giardia'' was first observed in 1681 by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in his own diarrhea stools. The organism was again observed and described in greater detail by [[Vilém Dušan Lambl]] in 1859, who thought the organism belonged to the genus ''[[Cercomonas]]'' and proposed the name ''[[Cercomonas intestinalis]]''. His name is still sometimes attached to the genus or the species infecting humans. Thereafter, some have named the genus after him while others have named the species of the human form after him ''Giardia lamblia''. In 1879, Grassi discovered a rodent parasite now known to be a ''Giardia'' species, ''Dimorphus muris'', apparently unaware of Lambl's earlier description. In 1882 and 1883, [[Johann Künstler]] described an organism in tadpoles (possibly ''[[Giardia agilis]]'') he named ''Giardia'', this being the first time ''Giardia'' was used as a genus name. The genus was chosen to honour Professor [[Alfred Mathieu Giard]] of Paris. [[Raphaël Blanchard]], in 1888, proposed the name ''Lamblia intestinalis'',<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Blanchard R |title=Remarques sur le mégastome intestinal |journal=Bulletin de la Société Zoologique de France |year=1888 |volume=13 |page=18}}</ref> after Lambl. Stiles changed it to ''Giardia duodenalis'' in 1902 and to ''Giardia lamblia'' in 1915.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/2/4/435 |author=Hegner RW |year=1922 |title=The systematic relationship of Giardia lamblia Stiles, 1915, from man and Giardia agilis Künstler 1882 from the tadpole |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=435}}</ref> The same year (1915), Kofoid and Christiansen wrote "The generic name ''Lamblia'' Blanchard 1888 should give way to ''Giardia'' Kunstler 1882 on ground of priority…"<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kofoid CA, Christiansen EB |title=On the Life-History of Giardia |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=547–52 |year=1915 |pmid=16576068 |pmc=1090891 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1.11.547}}</ref> (the epithet being ''intestinalis'') and used ''Giardia enterica'' in 1920.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The naming of the species still causes controversy. Initially, species names were based on the host of origin, leading to over 40 species. In 1922, Simon, using morphologic criteria to distinguish between ''Giardia lamblia'' and ''Giardia muris'', accepted the name ''Giardia lamblia'' for the human species. Filice in 1922 further revised the genus when he published a detailed morphologic description of the genus ''Giardia'' and proposed that three species names be used on the basis of the morphology of the median body: ''Giardia agilis'', ''Giardia duodenalis'' and ''Giardia muris''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The names for the human parasite ''Giardia duodenalis'', ''Giardia lamblia'' and ''Giardia intestinalis'' are all in common current use despite the potential for confusion this has created.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Van Leeuwenhoek's observations were recreated, using a single-lens microscope of the kind he used, by British microbiologist [[Brian J. Ford]], who showed how clearly one could view ''Giardia'' through a primitive microscope.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ford BJ |url=http://www.brianjford.com/Giardia-14-06.pdf |title=The discovery of ''Giardia'' |journal=The Microscope |year=2005 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=148–153}}</ref>

In 1998, a highly publicised ''Giardia'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' outbreak was reported in [[1998 Sydney water crisis|Sydney, Australia]], but it was found to be due to mismeasurement of the concentrations of microbes in the water supply.
A 2004 outbreak in [[Bergen]] ([[Norway]]) hastened work on adding UV treatment to the water facilities.
