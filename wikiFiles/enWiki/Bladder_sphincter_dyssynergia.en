Most common of them is detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD).</ref> that disrupts [[Pontine micturition center|central nervous system]] regulation of the [[micturition|micturition (urination)]] reflex resulting in dyscoordination of the [[Detrusor urinae muscle|detrusor muscles]] of the bladder and the [[external urethral sphincter]] muscles. In normal lower urinary tract function, these two separate muscle structures act in synergistic coordination.  But in this neurogenic disorder, the urethral sphincter muscle, instead of relaxing completely during voiding, dyssynergically contracts causing the flow to be interrupted and the bladder pressure to rise.

On [[cystography]] there is an irregular appearance of the bladder outline due to muscular contraction against the unrelaxed bladder sphincter.<ref>[http://www.sghurol.demon.co.uk/urod/hyperref.htm] Cystometry shows Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is overactivity in the presence of confirmed neuropathy in this case Multiple Sclerosis, Doug Small, Department of Urology, Southern General Hospital, Glasgow</ref>

==Pathology and symptoms==
The pathophysiology of the condition results from neuronal plasticity associated with bladder afferents and [[motor neurons]] innervating the external urethral sphincter. Symptomatically, people with this condition generally experience daytime and night time wetting, urinary retention, and often have a history of [[urinary tract]] and bladder infections. [[Constipation]] and [[encopresis]] are often associated with this condition.

==Diagnosis==
Strictly DSD can only be diagnosed from an [[Electromyography|EMG]] trace or [[x-ray]] findings, but the urodynamic trace in the image shows both the pressure and flow phenomena mentioned.<ref>[http://www.sghurol.demon.co.uk/urod/hyperref.htm] Cystometry shows High detrusor pressure and interrupted. Can not diagnose dyssynergia without emg or radiology but this trace is suggestive of dyssynergic voiding; Doug Small, Department of Urology, Southern General Hospital, Glasgow</ref>
