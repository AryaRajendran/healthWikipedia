The following is a '''list of mental disorders as defined by the DSM and ICD'''.

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) is the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s standard reference for [[psychiatry]] which includes over 400 different definitions of mental disorders. The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD) is published by the [[World Health Organization]], and it contains a section on psychological and behavioral disorders. The diagnostic criteria and information in the DSM and ICD are revised and updated with each new version. This list contains conditions currently recognised descriptions of mental disorders as defined by these two documents.

There is disagreement in various fields of [[mental health care]], including the field of [[psychiatry]], over the definitions and criteria used to delineate various disorders. Of particular concern to some professionals is whether some of these conditions should be classified as '[[mental illness]]es' at all, or whether they would be better described as [[neurological disorder]]s, or in other ways. Some items listed are ultimately removed: [[Homosexuality and psychology|homosexuality]] was originally listed in the DSM, but was removed when the American Psychiatric Association officially stated that "homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities".<ref name="apahelp">{{citation |url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref><ref name=amici>[http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, In re Marriage Cases Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365, Application for leave to file brief amici curiae in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion, and brief amici curiae of the American Psychological Association, California Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, and National Association of Social Workers, California Chapter in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion]</ref>
