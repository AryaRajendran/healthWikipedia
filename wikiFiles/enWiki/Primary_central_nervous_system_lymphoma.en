A '''primary central nervous system lymphoma''' ('''PCNSL'''), also known as '''microglioma''' and '''primary brain lymphoma''', <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/ddb29451.htm|title=CNS lymphoma, primary information|work=Diseases Database|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> is a [[brain tumor|primary intracranial tumor]] appearing mostly in patients with severe [[immunosuppression]] (typically patients with [[AIDS]]). PCNSLs represent around 20% of all cases of [[lymphoma]]s in [[HIV]] infections (other types are [[Burkitt's lymphoma]]s and immunoblastic lymphomas). Primary [[Central nervous system|CNS]] lymphoma is highly associated with [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) infection (> 90%) in [[Immunodeficiency|immunodeficient]] patients (such as those with AIDS and those [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenically]] immunosuppressed),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fine HA, Mayer RJ |title=Primary central nervous system lymphoma |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=119 |issue=11 |pages=1093–104 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid=8239229 }}</ref> and does not have a predilection for any particular age group. Mean [[CD4]]+ count at time of diagnosis is ~50/uL.  In immunocompromised patients, prognosis is usually poor.  In immunocompetent patients (that is, patients who do not have AIDS or some other immunodeficiency), there is rarely an association with EBV infection or other [[Virus#DNA_viruses|DNA viruses]]. In the immunocompetent population, PCNSLs typically appear in older patients in their 50's and 60's.  Importantly, the incidence of PCNSL in the immunocompetent population has been reported to have increased more than 10-fold from 2.5 cases to 30 cases per 10 million population.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eby NL, Grufferman S, Flannelly CM, Schold SC, Vogel FS, Burger PC |title=Increasing incidence of primary brain lymphoma in the US |journal=Cancer |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=2461–5 |year=1988 |month=December |pmid=3179963 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Corn BW, Marcus SM, Topham A, Hauck W, Curran WJ |title=Will primary central nervous system lymphoma be the most frequent brain tumor diagnosed in the year 2000? |journal=Cancer |volume=79 |issue=12 |pages=2409–13 |year=1997 |month=June |pmid=9191531 }}</ref>  The cause for the increase in incidence of this disease in the immunocompetent population is unknown.

==Classification==
Most PCNSLs are diffuse large [[B cell]] [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lukes RJ, Collins RD |title=Immunologic characterization of human malignant lymphomas |journal=Cancer |volume=34 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=1488–503 |year=1974 |month=October |pmid=4608683 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jellinger K, Radaskiewicz TH, Slowik F |title=Primary malignant lymphomas of the central nervous system in man |journal=Acta Neuropathol |issue=Suppl 6 |pages=95–102 |year=1975 |pmid=1098380 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
A primary CNS lymphoma usually presents with [[Non-epileptic seizure|seizure]], [[headache]], cranial nerve findings, altered mental status, or other focal neurological deficits typical of a [[Mass effect (medicine)|mass effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bataille B, Delwail V, Menet E, ''et al.'' |title=Primary intracerebral malignant lymphoma: report of 248 cases |journal=J.

*[[monocular vision]] loss

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Primary CNS lymphoma - very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing a primary CNS lymphoma with the characteristic perivascular distribution composed of large cells with prominent [[nucleoli]]. [[Brain biopsy]]. [[HPS stain]].]]
The definitive diagnosis is arrived at from tissue, i.e. a biopsy, by a [[pathologist]].

[[MRI]] or contrast enhanced [[Computed tomography|CT]] classically shows multiple [[ring-enhancing lesion]]s in the deep [[white matter]]. The major [[differential diagnosis]] (based on imaging) is cerebral [[toxoplasmosis]], which is also prevalent in AIDS patients and also presents with a ring-enhanced lesion, although toxoplasmosis generally presents with more lesions and the contrast enhancement is typically more pronounced.  [[Medical imaging|Imaging techniques]] cannot distinguish the two conditions with certainty, and cannot exclude other diagnoses.  Thus, patients undergo a [[brain biopsy]].

==Treatment==
Surgical [[Segmental resection|resection]] is usually ineffective because of the depth of the tumor. Treatment with [[Radiation therapy|irradiation]] and [[corticosteroid]]s often only produces a partial response and tumor recurs in more than 90% of patients. Median survival is 10 to 18 months in [[Immunocompetence|immunocompetent]] patients, and less in those with AIDS. The addition of IV [[methotrexate]] and [[folinic acid]] (leucovorin)  may extend survival to a median of 3.5 years. If radiation is added to methotrexate, median survival time may increase beyond 4 years.  However, radiation is not recommended in conjunction with methotrexate because of an increased risk of [[leukoencephalopathy]] and [[dementia]] in patients older than 60.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deangelis LM, Hormigo A |title=Treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma |journal=Semin. Oncol. |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=684–92 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15497122 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0093775404003331}}</ref>  In AIDS patients, perhaps the most important factor with respect to treatment is the use of [[Antiretroviral drug|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART), which affects the CD4+ lymphocyte population and the level of immunosuppression.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The optimal treatment plan for patients with PCNSL has not been determined. Combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy at least doubles survival time, but causes dementia and leukoencephalopathy in at least 50% of patients who undergo it. The most studied chemotheraputic agent in PCNSL is [[methotrexate]] (a folate analogue that interferes with [[DNA]] repair). Methotrexate therapy in patients with PCNSL typically requires hospitalization for close monitoring and intravenus fluids. Leucovrin is often given for the duration of the therapy. Standard chemotherapeutic regimens for lymphoma such as [[CHOP]] are ineffective in PCNSL, probably due to poor penetration of the agents through the [[blood brain barrier]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1157638|Primary CNS Lymphoma|treatment}}</ref>

Newer treatments, such as high dose chemotherapy combined with stem cell transplant are proving to increase survival by years.

==Prognosis==
===In immunocompetent patients===

The initial response to radiotherapy is often excellent, and may result in a complete remission. However,the duration of response with radiotherapy alone remains short, with median survival after treatment with radiotherapy just 18 months. Methotrexate based chemotherapy markedly improves survival,with some studies showing median survival after methotrexate chemotherapy reaching 48 months.<ref name=EMed_fol>{{EMedicine|article|1157638|Primary CNS Lymphoma|followup}}</ref>

===In AIDS patients===

Patients with [[AIDS]] and PCNSL have a median survival of only 4 months with radiotherapy alone. Untreated, median survival is only 2.5 months, sometimes due to concurrent opportunistic infections rather than the lymphoma itself. Extended survival has been seen, however, in a subgroup of AIDS patients with [[CD4]] counts of more than 200 and no concurrent opportunistic infections, who can tolerate aggressive therapy consisting of either methotrexate monotherapy or [[vincristine]], procarbazine, or whole brain radiotherapy. These patients have a median survival of 10–18 months. Of course, [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART) is critical for prolonged survival in any AIDS patient, so compliance with HAART may play a role in survival in patients with concurrent AIDS and PCNSL.<ref name=EMed_fol/>
