The '''Apgar score''' was devised in 1952 by the [[eponymous]] [[Virginia Apgar|Dr. Virginia Apgar]] as a simple and repeatable method to quickly and summarily assess the health of [[newborn]] children immediately after [[childbirth|birth]].<ref name="Apgar53">{{cite journal

The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a [[backronym]] ('''A'''ppearance, '''P'''ulse, '''G'''rimace, '''A'''ctivity, '''R'''espiration).

==Interpretation of scores==
[[image:Apgar score.png|thumb|right|350px|Mind map showing summary for the Apgar score]]
The test is generally done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above are generally normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low.

A low score on the one-minute test may show that the neonate requires medical attention<ref>{{cite journal

If the Apgar score remains below 3 at later times such as 10, 15, or 30 minutes, there is a risk that the child will suffer longer-term [[neurology|neurological]] damage. There is also a small but significant increase of the risk of [[cerebral palsy]]. However, the purpose of the Apgar test is to determine quickly whether a newborn needs immediate medical care; it was ''not'' designed to make long-term predictions on a child's health.<ref name="Apgar53" />

A score of 10 is uncommon due to the prevalence of transient cyanosis, and is not substantially different from a score of 9.  Transient cyanosis is common, particularly in babies born at high altitude.  A study comparing babies born in Peru near sea level with babies born at very high altitude (4340 m) found a significant difference in the first but not the second Apgar score.  Oxygen saturation (see [[Pulse oximetry]]) also was lower at high altitude.<ref name="pmid16156890">{{cite journal

==Backronym==
Some ten years after the initial publication, a [[backronym]] for '''APGAR''' was coined in the United States as a [[mnemonic]] learning aid: '''A'''ppearance (skin color), '''P'''ulse (heart rate), '''G'''rimace (reflex irritability), '''A'''ctivity (muscle tone), and '''R'''espiration. In German, the words '''''A'''tmung, '''P'''uls, '''G'''rundtonus, '''A'''ussehen, '''R'''eflexe'' were used; in Spanish, '''''A'''pariencia, '''P'''ulso, '''G'''esticulación, '''A'''ctividad, '''R'''espiración''; in Portuguese, '''''A'''parência, '''P'''ulso, '''G'''esticulação, '''A'''tividade, '''R'''espiração''; and, in French, '''''A'''pparence, '''P'''ouls, '''G'''rimace, '''A'''ctivité, '''R'''espiration''.

Another case where Dr. Apgar's name is [[eponym]]ous for a backronym is '''American Pediatric Gross Assessment Record'''.

Another mnemonic devised for the test is to use the phrase “'''H'''ow '''R'''eady '''I'''s '''T'''his '''C'''hild”, which summarizes the test criteria as '''H'''eart rate, '''R'''espiratory effort, '''I'''rritability, '''T'''one, and '''C'''olor.
