'''Excretion''' is the process by which waste products of [[metabolism]] and other non-useful materials are eliminated from an [[organism]]. In vertebrates this is primarily carried out by the [[lungs]], [[kidneys]] and [[skin]].<ref name='beckett'>{{cite book | last = Beckett | first = B.

Excretion is an essential process in all forms of life.

In [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]], waste products are discharged directly through the surface of the cell.

In [[plant]]s, breakdown of substances is much slower than in animals. Hence accumulation of waste is much slower and there are no special organs of excretion. Green plants in darkness or plants that do not contain chlorophyll produce carbon dioxide and water as respiratory waste products. [[Carbon dioxide]] released during respiration gets utilized during photosynthesis.  Oxygen itself can be thought of as a waste product generated during [[photosynthesis]], and exits through [[stomata]], root cell walls, and other routes.  Plants can get rid of excess water by transpiration and [[guttation]]. Waste products may be stored in leaves that fall off. Other waste materials that are exuded by some plants — resins, saps, latexes, etc. are forced from the interior of the plant by hydrostatic pressures inside the plant and by absorptive forces of plant cells. These processes do not need added energy, they act passively.<ref>"excretion." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.

[[Aquatic animal]]s usually excrete [[ammonia]] directly into the external environment, as this compound has high [[solubility]] and there is ample water available for dilution. In [[terrestrial animal]]s ammonia-like compounds are converted into other nitrogenous materials as there is less water in the environment and ammonia itself is [[toxic]].

[[Bird]]s excrete their nitrogenous wastes as [[uric acid]] in the form of a paste. This is metabolically more expensive, but allows more efficient [[water]] retention and it can be stored more easily in the [[egg (bird)|egg]]. Many avian species, especially [[seabird]]s, can also excrete salt via specialized nasal salt glands, the saline solution leaving through nostrils in the [[beak]].

In [[insect]]s, a system involving [[Malpighian tubule]]s is utilized to excrete [[metabolic waste]]. Metabolic waste diffuses or is actively transported into the tubule, which transports the wastes to the intestines. The metabolic waste is then released from the body along with fecal matter.
