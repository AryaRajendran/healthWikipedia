'''''Mycobacterium africanum''''' is a species of ''Mycobacterium'' that is most commonly found in West African countries. The symptoms of infection resemble those of ''M. tuberculosis''.

It is a member of the [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex]].<ref name="pmid20350321">{{cite journal |author=Vasconcellos SE, Huard RC, Niemann S, ''et al.'' |title=Distinct genotypic profiles of the two major clades of Mycobacterium africanum |journal=BMC Infect.

==Epidemiology==
''M. africanum'' is most commonly found in West African countries, causing up to a quarter of cases of tuberculosis in countries such as the Gambia. It is an infection of humans only and is spread by an airborne route from individuals with open cases of disease.

It has a similar degree of infectivity to the regular ''M. tuberculosis'' organism but is less likely to progress to clinical disease in an immunocompetent individual.

''M. africanum'' is more likely to progress from infection to causing disease in an HIV positive patient, hence in countries where ''M. africanum'' is endemic, it represents an important opportunistic infection of the later stages of HIV disease.

==Pathogenesis==
It is not fully understood how the genetic differences between ''M. africanum'' and ''M. tuberculosis'' give rise to the lower pathogenicity of the former. However, it is known that the Region of Difference 9 (RD9) is lacking in ''M. africanum'' but present in ''M. tuberculosis'' (Brosch, et al. 2002 PNAS 99:3684
).

==Treatment==

''M. africanum'' tuberculosis is treated with an identical regime to tuberculosis caused by ''M. tuberculosis''. The overall rate of cure is similar, but as more ''M. africanum'' patients are likely to be HIV positive, they may have higher mortality from other HIV-related disease
