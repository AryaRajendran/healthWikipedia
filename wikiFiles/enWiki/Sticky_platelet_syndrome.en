It has not been associated with a specific gene, and it is not recognized as an entity in [[OMIM]].

Among researchers using the term, it has been described as a coagulation disorder that can present in conjunction with [[protein S deficiency]] and [[Factor V Leiden]].<ref name="pmid9973658">{{Cite journal|author=Chaturvedi S, Dzieczkowski JS |title=Protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance and sticky platelet syndrome in a young woman with bilateral strokes |journal=Cerebrovasc.

It is not currently known if sticky platelet syndrome is a distinct condition, or if it represents part of the presentation of a more well characterized coagulation disorder.

==Diagnosis==
SPS is diagnosed by demonstrating platelet hyperaggregability.  In a lab test called aggregometry platelet stickyness is stimulated with epinephrine (EPI) and/or adenosine diphosphate (ADP).<ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T1C-47T2D4S-4&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=fa06922a824e24db83382664b8659e30</ref>  This test is not possible for patients being treated with [[Aspirin|acetylsalicylic acid]] until that substance has sufficiently cleared from their system.

==Treatment==
Those diagnosed are usually treated with taking a low dose (80–100&nbsp;mg) [[Aspirin]] a day.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10548069 | doi=10.1055/s-2007-994939 | volume=25 | issue=4 | title=Sticky platelet syndrome | year=1999 | journal=Semin. Thromb. Hemost. | pages=361–5 | author=Mammen EF}}</ref>  [[Anticoagulant]]s (e.g. [[Warfarin]], [[Coumadin]] or [[Plavix]]) are often additionally prescribed following formation of a medically significant clot. Thrombelastography is more commonly being used to diagnose hypercoagulability and monitor anti-platelet therapy.

==Criticism==
Critics of the diagnosis complain that case evidence is spotty and lacking controlled clinical studies.<ref>http://www.fvleiden.org/ask/78.html</ref>
