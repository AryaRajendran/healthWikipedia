'''Vancomycin''' [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|v|æ|ŋ|k|ɵ|ˈ|m|aɪ|s|ɨ|n}}) is a [[glycopeptide antibiotic]] used in the [[prophylaxis]] and treatment of infections caused by [[Gram-positive]] [[bacteria]]. Vancomycin was first isolated in 1953 at [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], from a soil sample collected from the interior jungles of [[Borneo]] by a missionary. It is a naturally occurring antibiotic made by the soil bacterium [[Actinobacteria]] species ''[[Amycolatopsis|Amycolatopsis orientalis]]'' (formerly designated ''Nocardia orientalis''). It is a complex chemical compound and an example of a comparatively rare haloorganic natural compound, containing two covalently bonded chlorine atoms.  

The compound was industrially produced by fermentation and given the generic name '''vancomycin''', derived from the term "vanquish." The original indication for vancomycin was for the treatment of [[penicillin]]-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]],'' a use kept alive for many years by the fact that compound had to be given intravenously and thus provided bacteria fewer opportunities to evolve resistance, and the fact that organisms were relatively slow to evolve to adapt to it, even in experiments. 

For many years since its initial use, vancomycin has traditionally been reserved as a [[drug of last resort|drug of "last resort"]], used only after treatment with other antibiotics had failed,{{Citation needed|date = September 2011}}. Recently, however, vancomycin resistant organisms are becoming common. Thus, vancomycin is increasingly being displaced from this role by newer antibiotics such as [[linezolid]] (Zyvox), [[daptomycin]] (Cubicin), and [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] (Synercid).

== History ==
Vancomycin was first isolated in 1953 by [[Edmund Kornfeld]] (working at [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]]) from a soil sample collected from the interior jungles of [[Borneo]] by a missionary.<ref name="Shnayerson">Shnayerson, Michael; Plotkin, Mark (2003).

The compound was initially called '''compound 05865''', but was eventually given the generic name '''vancomycin''', derived from the term "vanquish".<ref name="Levine2006"/> One advantage that was quickly apparent is that staphylococci did not develop significant resistance despite serial passage in culture media containing vancomycin. The rapid development of [[penicillin]] resistance by staphylococci led to the compound's being fast-tracked for approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1958. Eli Lilly first marketed vancomycin hydrochloride under the trade name '''Vancocin'''<ref name="Moellering2006"/> and as '''COVANC''' from Nucleus, India.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Vancomycin never became the first-line treatment for ''Staphylococcus aureus'' for several reasons:
#It possesses poor oral bioavailability; it must be given [[intravenously]] for most infections.
#β-Lactamase-resistant semi-synthetic penicillins such as [[methicillin]] (and its successors, [[nafcillin]] and [[cloxacillin]]) were subsequently developed, which have better activity against non-MRSA staphylococci.
#Early trials used early impure forms of vancomycin ("Mississippi mud"), which were found to be toxic to the ears and to the kidneys;<ref name="Griffiths1981">{{cite journal | author=Griffith RS. | title=Introduction to vancomycin | journal=Rev Infect Dis | year=1981 | volume=3 | pages=S200-S204 }}</ref> these findings led to vancomycin's being relegated to the position of a drug of last resort.<ref name="Moellering2006"/>

In 2004, [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] licensed ''Vancocin'' to [[ViroPharma]] in the U.S., [[Flynn Pharma]] in the UK, and [[Aspen Pharmacare]] in Australia. The [[patent]] expired in the early 1980s; the FDA authorized the sale of several generic versions in the USA, including from manufacturers Bioniche Pharma, [[Baxter Healthcare]], [[Sandoz]], Akorn Strides and [[Hospira]].<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/tempai.cfm Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

An oral form of vancomycin was originally approved by the FDA in 1986 for the treatment of ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' induced [[pseudomembranous colitis]]. It is not orally absorbed into the blood and remains in the gastrointestinal tract to eradicate ''C. difficile''. This product is currently marketed by [[ViroPharma]] in the USA.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=050606&TABLE1=OB_Rx Orange Book Detail Record Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Image:Biosynthesis of Vancomycin.png|thumb|left|Figure 3: Modifications that are necessary for Vancomycin to become biologically active.]]
A set of multienzymes (peptide synthase CepA, CepB, and CepC) are responsible for assembling the heptapeptide. (Figure 2). The organization of CepA, CepB, and Cep C closely resembles other peptide synthases such as those for surfactin (SrfA1, SrfA2, and SrfA3) and gramicidin (GrsA and GrsB).<ref name="pmid9545426"/> Each peptide synthase activates codes for various amino acids in order to activate each domain. CepA codes for modules 1, 2, and 3. CepB codes for modules 4, 5, and 6. And CepC codes for module 7. The three peptide synthases are located at the start of the region of the bacterial genome linked with [[antibiotic]] biosynthesis and spans 27 kb.<ref name="pmid9545426"/>

After the linear heptapeptide molecule is synthesized, Vancomycin has to undergo further modifications, such as oxidative cross-linking and [[glycosylation]], in trans{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} by distinct enzymes, referred to as tailoring enzymes, in order to become biologically active (Figure 3). To convert the linear heptapeptide, eight enzymes, [[open reading frame]]s (ORF) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 20, and 21 are used. The enzymes ORF 7, 8, 9, and 20 are P450 enzymes.

==Pharmacology and chemistry==
Vancomycin is a branched [[Wiktionary:tricyclic|tricyclic]] [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] [[nonribosomal peptide]] produced by the [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of the [[Actinobacteria]] species ''[[Amycolatopsis|Amycolatopsis orientalis]]'' (formerly designated ''Nocardia orientalis'').

Vancomycin exhibits [[atropisomer]]ism — it has multiple chemically distinct [[rotamer]]s owing to the rotational restriction of some of the bonds. The form present in the drug is the thermodynamically more stable [[conformer]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and, therefore,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} has more potent activity.

=== Mechanism of action ===

Vancomycin acts by inhibiting proper [[cell wall]] synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. Due to the different mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria produce their cell walls and the various factors related to entering the outer membrane of [[Gram-negative]] organisms, vancomycin is not active against Gram-negative bacteria (except some non-gonococcal species of [[Neisseria]]).

The large [[hydrophilic]] molecule is able to form [[hydrogen bond]] interactions with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides. Under normal circumstances, this is a five-point interaction. This binding of vancomycin to the D-Ala-D-Ala prevents cell wall synthesis in two ways. It prevents the synthesis of the long polymers of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) that form the backbone strands of the bacterial cell wall, and it prevents the backbone polymers that do manage to form from cross-linking with each other.<ref>[http://www.clinicalpharmacology-ip.com/Forms/Monograph/monograph.aspx?cpnum=638&sec=monmech Clinical Pharmacology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[File:Vancomycin resistance.svg|thumb|center|800px|
Mechanism of vancomycin action and resistance. Note that this diagram shows only one of two ways vancomycin acts against bacteria (inhibition of cell wall cross-linking) and only one of many ways that bacteria can become resistant to it.
<ol>
<li>Vancomycin is added to the bacterial environment while it is trying to synthesize new cell wall. Here, the cell wall strands have been synthesized, but not yet cross-linked.</li>
<li>Vancomycin recognizes and binds to the two D-ala residues on the end of the peptide chains. However, in resistant bacteria, the last D-ala residue has been replaced by a D-lactate, so vancomycin cannot bind.</li>
<li>In resistant bacteria, cross-links are successfully formed. However, in the non-resistant bacteria, the vancomycin bound to the peptide chains prevents them from interacting properly with the cell wall cross-linking enzyme.</li>
<li>In the resistant bacteria, stable cross links are formed. In the sensitive bacteria, cross-links cannot be formed and the cell wall falls apart.</li>
</ol>]]

==Clinical use==

===Indications===
Vancomycin is indicated for the treatment of serious, life-threatening infections by [[Gram-positive]] bacteria that are unresponsive to other less-toxic antibiotics. In particular, vancomycin should not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive [[Staphylococcus aureus]] because it is inferior to penicillins such as [[nafcillin]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Small PM, Chambers HF|title=Vancomycin for ''Staphylococcus aureus'' endocarditis in intravenous drug users|journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother|year=1990|volume=34|pages=1227&ndash;31|pmid=2393284|issue=6|pmc=171789}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gonzalez C, Rubio M, Romero-Vivas J, Gonzalez M, Picazo JJ|title=Bacteremic pneumonia due to ''Staphylococcus aureus'': a comparison of disease caused by methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible organisms|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=1999|volume=29|pages=1171&ndash;7|pmid=10524959|doi=10.1086/313440|issue=5}}</ref>

The increasing emergence of vancomycin-resistant [[enterococcus|enterococci]] has resulted in the development of guidelines for use by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. These guidelines restrict use of vancomycin to the following indications:<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006.

*Treatment of [[Pseudomembranous colitis]] caused by the bacterium ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''; in particular, in cases of relapse or where the infection is unresponsive to [[metronidazole]] treatment (for this indication, vancomycin is given orally, rather than via its typical, I.V. route)
*For treatment of infections caused by gram-positive microorganisms in patients with serious allergies to beta-lactam antimicrobials.<ref name=cdc/>
*Antibacterial prophylaxis for [[endocarditis]] following certain procedures in penicillin-[[hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]] individuals at high risk<ref name=cdc/>

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with IV vancomycin include: local pain, which may be severe and/or [[thrombophlebitis]].

It has recently been emphasized that vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive antibodies in the patient, leading to severe [[thrombocytopenia]] and bleeding with florid [[Petechia|petechial hemorrhages]], [[ecchymoses]], and [[wet purpura]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Drygalski A, Curtis BR | title=Vancomycin-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia | journal= N Engl J Med | year=2007 | volume=356 | pages=904–10 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa065066 | pmid=17329697 | issue=9}}</ref>

===Dosing considerations===

====Intravenous vs oral administration====
Vancomycin must be given [[intravenous]]ly (IV) for systemic therapy, since it is not absorbed from the intestine. It is a large hydrophilic molecule that partitions poorly across the gastrointestinal [[mucosa]]. Due to short half-life it is often injected twice-daily.<ref name=VB2006>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16955686 |author=Van Bambeke F. |title=Glycopeptides and glycodepsipeptides in clinical development: a comparative review of their antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy, |journal=Curr Opin Investig Drugs. |date=2006 Aug |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=740-9 }} http://www.facm.ucl.ac.be/Full-texts-FACM/Vanbambeke-2006-3.pdf </ref>

The only indication for oral vancomycin therapy is in the treatment of [[pseudomembranous colitis]], where it must be given orally to reach the site of infection in the colon. Following oral administration, the fecal concentration of vancomycin is around 500&nbsp;µg/mL<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/513755|author=Edlund C, Barkholt L, Olsson-Liljequist B, Nord CE|title=Effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=1997|volume=25|issue=3|pages=729&ndash;32|pmid=9314469}}</ref> (sensitive strains of ''C. difficile'' have a mean inhibitory concentration of ≤2&nbsp;µg/mL<ref>{{cite journal|author=Peláez T, Alcalá L, Alonso R, ''et al.''|title=Reassessment of ''Clostridium difficile'' susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin|journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother|year=2002|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1647&ndash;1650|doi=10.1128/AAC.46.6.1647-1650.2002}}</ref>)

Inhaled vancomycin has also been used ([[off-label]]), via [[nebulizer]], for treatment of various infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract.

The caustic nature of vancomycin makes IV therapy using peripheral lines a risk for thrombophlebitis. Ideally, central lines, PICCs, or infusion ports should be used.<ref>[http://www.nursingcenter.com/prodev/ce_article.asp?tid=745323 Choosing the Right Intravenous Catheter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Red man syndrome====<!-- This section is linked from [[Vancomycin]] -->
{{see also|Erythroderma}}
Vancomycin is recommended to be administered in a dilute solution slowly, over at least 60 minutes (maximum rate of 10&nbsp;mg/minute for doses >500&nbsp;mg).<ref name="AMH2006" /> This is due to the high incidence of [[pain]] and [[thrombophlebitis]] and to avoid an infusion reaction known as the '''red man syndrome''' or '''red neck syndrome'''. This syndrome, usually appearing within 4–10 minutes after the commencement or soon after the completion of an infusion, is characterized by flushing and/or an [[erythematous]] rash that affects the face, neck, and upper torso. These findings are due to non-specific [[mast cell]] degranulation and are not an [[IgE]]-mediated allergic reaction. Less frequently, [[hypotension]] and [[angioedema]] may also occur. Symptoms may be treated or prevented with [[antihistamine]]s, including [[diphenhydramine]], and are less likely to occur with slow infusion.<ref name="Sivagnanam2003">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/cc1871 | last1 = Sivagnanam | first1 = S | last2 = Deleu | first2 = D | title = Red man syndrome | journal = Critical care (London, England) | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–20 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12720556 | pmc = 270616 }}</ref><ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

===Therapeutic drug monitoring===
Plasma level monitoring of vancomycin is necessary due to the drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity is considered to be time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] (MIC) of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity – indeed concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] (TDM) is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] parameters, patients on [[hemodialysis|haemodialysis]], patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.<ref name="AMH2006" /><ref name="Cantu1994">{{cite journal | last1 = Cantú | first1 = TG | last2 = Yamanaka-Yuen | first2 = NA | last3 = Lietman | first3 = PS | title = Serum vancomycin concentrations: reappraisal of their clinical value | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 533–43 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8038306 }}</ref><ref name="Moellering1994">{{cite journal | last1 = Moellering Jr | first1 = RC | title = Monitoring serum vancomycin levels: climbing the mountain because it is there? | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 544–6 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8038307 | doi=10.1093/clinids/18.4.544}}</ref><ref name="Karam1999">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1592/phco.19.4.257.30933 | last1 = Karam | first1 = CM | last2 = McKinnon | first2 = PS | last3 = Neuhauser | first3 = MM | last4 = Rybak | first4 = MJ | title = Outcome assessment of minimizing vancomycin monitoring and dosing adjustments | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–66 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10221365 }}</ref>

Target ranges for serum vancomycin concentrations have changed over the years. Early authors suggested peak levels of 30–40&nbsp;mg/L and [[trough levels]] of 5–10&nbsp;mg/L,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geraci J|title=Vancomycin|journal=Mayo Clin Proc|year=1977|volume=52|pages=631&ndash;4|pmid=909314|issue=10}}</ref>
but current recommendations are that peak levels need not be measured and that [[trough levels]] of 10-15 or 15–20&nbsp;mg/L, depending on the nature of the infection and the specific needs of the patient, may be appropriate.<ref>{{cite journal

==Usage in plant tissue culture==
Vancomycin is one of the few antibiotics used in plant tissue culture to eliminate gram positive bacteria infection. It has relatively low toxicity to plants.<ref name="Vancomcyin for plant tissue culture">[http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/index/Vancomycin%20HCl.pdf vancomcin for plant cell culture]</ref>

==Toxicity==
Vancomycin has traditionally been considered a [[nephrotoxic]] and [[ototoxic]] drug, based on observations by early investigators of elevated serum levels in renally impaired patients that had experienced ototoxicity, and subsequently through case reports in the medical literature. However, as the use of vancomycin increased with the spread of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] beginning in the 1970s, it was recognised that the previously reported rates of toxicity were not being observed. This was attributed to the removal of the impurities present in the earlier formulation of the drug, although those impurities were not specifically tested for toxicity.<ref name="Levine2006"/>

===Nephrotoxicity===
Subsequent reviews of accumulated case reports of vancomycin-related [[nephrotoxicity]] found that many of the patients had also received other known nephrotoxins, in particular, [[aminoglycosides]]. Most of the rest had other confounding factors, or insufficient data regarding the possibility of such, that prohibited the clear association of vancomycin with the observed renal dysfunction.

In 1994, Cantu and colleagues found that the use of vancomycin monotherapy was clearly documented in only three of 82 available cases in the literature.<ref name="Cantu1994" /> Prospective and retrospective studies attempting to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity have largely been methodologically flawed and have produced variable results. The most methodologically sound investigations indicate that the actual incidence of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is around 5–7%. To put this into context, similar rates of renal dysfunction have been reported for [[cefamandole]] and [[benzylpenicillin]], two reputedly non-nephrotoxic antibiotics.

In addition, evidence to relate nephrotoxicity to vancomycin serum levels is inconsistent. Some studies have indicated an increased rate of nephrotoxicity when trough levels exceed 10&nbsp;µg/mL, but others have not reproduced these results. Nephrotoxicity has also been observed with concentrations within the "therapeutic" range as well. In essence, the reputation of vancomycin as a nephrotoxin is over-stated, and it has not been demonstrated that maintaining vancomycin serum levels within certain ranges will prevent its nephrotoxic effects, when they do occur.

===Ototoxicity===<!-- This section is linked from [[Vancomycin]] (this page)-->
Attempts to establish rates of vancomycin-induced [[ototoxicity]] are even more difficult due to the scarcity of quality evidence. The current consensus is that clearly related cases of vancomycin ototoxicity are rare. The association between vancomycin serum levels and ototoxicity is also uncertain. While cases of ototoxicity have been reported in patients whose vancomycin serum level exceeded 80&nbsp;µg/mL, cases have been reported in patients with therapeutic levels as well. Thus, it also remains unproven that [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] of vancomycin for the purpose of maintaining "therapeutic" levels will prevent ototoxicity.

===Interactions with other nephrotoxins===
Another area of controversy and uncertainty concerns the question of whether, and, if so, to what extent, vancomycin increases the toxicity of other nephrotoxins. Clinical studies have yielded variable results, but animal models indicate that there probably is some increased nephrotoxic effect when vancomycin is added to nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides. However, a dose- or serum level-effect relationship has not been established.

==Antibiotic resistance==

===Intrinsic resistance===
There are a few [[gram-positive]] bacteria that are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin: ''[[Leuconostoc]]'' and ''[[Pediococcus]]'' species, but these organisms are rare causes of disease in humans.<ref name="Swenson1990">{{cite journal | author=Swenson JM, Facklam RR, Thornsberry C | title=Antimicrobial susceptibility of vancomycin-resistant Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and Lactobacillus species | journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother | year=1990 | month = April | volume=34 | issue=4 | pages=543–9 |pmid=2344161 | pmc=171641

===Acquired resistance===
Evolution of microbial [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to vancomycin is a growing problem, in particular, within healthcare facilities such as hospitals. While newer alternatives to vancomycin exist, such as [[linezolid]] (2000) and [[daptomycin]] (2003), the widespread use of vancomycin makes resistance to the drug a significant worry, especially for individual patients if resistant infections are not quickly identified and the patient continues the ineffective treatment. [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|Vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE) emerged in 1987. Vancomycin resistance evolved in more common pathogenic organisms during the 1990s and 2000s, including [[vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VISA) and [[vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VRSA).<ref name="Smith1999">{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = TL | last2 = Pearson | first2 = ML | last3 = Wilcox | first3 = KR | last4 = Cruz | first4 = C | last5 = Lancaster | first5 = MV | last6 = Robinson-Dunn | first6 = B | last7 = Tenover | first7 = FC | last8 = Zervos | first8 = MJ | last9 = Band | first9 = JD | title = Emergence of vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.

One mechanism of resistance to vancomycin involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-alanine, to which vancomycin binds. The <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-lactate variation results in the loss of one hydrogen-bonding interaction (4, as opposed to 5 for <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-alanine) possible between vancomycin and the peptide. This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity. The <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-serine variation causes a six-fold loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pootoolal J, Neu J, Wright GD|title=Glycopeptide antibiotic resistance |journal=Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol | year=2002 | pages=381–408 | volume=42 | pmid=11807177 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.42.091601.142813 }}</ref>

In enterococci, this modification appears to be due to the expression of an enzyme that alters the terminal residue. Three main resistance variants have been characterised to date among resistant ''Enterococcus faecium'' and ''E. faecalis'' populations.
*VanA - resistance to vancomycin and [[teicoplanin]]; inducible on exposure to these agents
*VanB - lower-level resistance; inducible by vancomycin, but strains may remain susceptible to teicoplanin
*VanC - least clinically important; resistance only to vancomycin; constitutive resistance

2011: A variant of vancomycin was tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target, thus reinstates potent antimicrobial activity.<ref>{{cite journal | title=A Redesigned Vancomycin Engineered for Dual d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Lac Binding Exhibits Potent Antimicrobial Activity Against Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria | last = Xie | first = J | journal = [[J.
