The '''Both respirator''', also known as the ''Both Portable Cabinet Respirator'', was a [[negative pressure ventilator]] (more commonly known as an "iron lung") invented by [[Edward Both]] in 1937. Made from [[plywood]], the respirator was an affordable alternative to the more expensive designs that had been used prior to its development, and accordingly came into common usage in Australia. More widespread use emerged during the 1940s and 1950s, when the Both respirator was offered free of charge to [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] hospitals by [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|William Morris]].

==Development==
In 1937 Australia faced a [[poliomyelitis]] (polio) epidemic.<ref name="Trubuhovich2006">{{cite journal|last=Trubuhovich|first=Ronald V|title=Notable Australian contributions to the management of ventilatory failure of acute poliomyelitis|journal=Critical Care and Resuscitation|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=384–385}}</ref> At the time iron lungs provided one of the main methods of treating the "paralytic breathing failures" that were a complication of the illness. Although tank respirators had been developed earlier, the iron lung itself was still fairly new, having been designed by [[Phillip Drinker]] and [[Louis Agassiz Shaw]] in 1928.<ref name="Woollam1976">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1976.tb11849.x|last=Woollam|first=C.

Thus Adelaide inventor Edward Both was approached in the hope that he could provide an alternative to meet the demand brought on by the epidemic. Both ran Both Equipment Limited with his brother Donald, and had previously developed medical apparatus. It took but a few weeks for the pair to create their own iron lung, which they named the "Both portable cabinet respirator". Unlike the Drinker's machine, the Both respirator was made from plywood (even though it continued to be referred to as an "iron" lung), and this both kept the price down and made it more portable. The Both device cost only £100, was portable due to its light weight and the addition of wheels, and was simple enough that hospitals could build their own in their workshops, and thus it soon proved to be a success.<ref name="Trubuhovich2006" /> The portability also opened up other possibilities, and as a result people who needed extended assistance from the device were able to use one in their private residences: indeed, in 2003 there were still five privately owned Both respirators being used in residences within Victoria.<ref name="Trubuhovich2006" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Both respirator|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/australia_innovates/?Section_id=1030&article_id=10022&behaviour=view_article#|work=Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

==Both and Nuffield==

In 1938 Edward Both traveled to England to sell an [[electrocardiograph]] which he had invented.<ref name="Trubuhovich2006" /> While there he heard over [[BBC Radio]] a request for an iron lung to help treat a young patient residing in a country hospital.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inventor Hears Radio Call|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12108779|accessdate=12 August 2010|newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]|date=18 March 1939}}</ref> Responding to the call, Both hired a workshop and assembled one of his designs within 24 hours, and the Both respirator was able to quickly gain the approval of the London County Council. Subsequently he built more of the respirators during his stay, and one was sent to the Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] where a short film was made of the device. This film was subsequently shown to [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|William Morris]] (Lord Nuffield) by [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Robert Macintosh]], the department's Professor. Nuffield was known as the manufacturer of the [[Morris Motors|Morris motor car]] as well as a philanthropist.<ref name="Trubuhovich2006" />

Nuffield was taken by the design, and in November of that year he offered to turn over part of his car factory for the manufacture of the Both respirators, and to provide the respirators free of charge to any hospital in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] that requested one.<ref name="Trubuhovich2006" /> In spite of some initial opposition – Nuffield was criticized in the [[British Medical Journal]] by Frederick Menzies for using a design before the iron lung had been perfected, and for supplying it to hospitals which may lack the knowledge as to how to employ it<ref>{{cite news|title=Iron Lung not Perfect|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17562923|accessdate=12 August 2010|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=7 January 1939}}</ref> – over 1700 Both-Nuffield respirators were distributed to hospitals.<ref name="Trubuhovich2006" /> By the early 1950s, for example, there were over 700 Both-Nuffield iron lungs in the United Kingdom, compared with only 50 Drinker's models.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Ghislaine|title=The Smith-Clarke Respirator|journal=[[The Lancet]]|date=23 February 2002|volume=359|pmid=11879908}}</ref>
