'''Vegetarianism''' is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of  [[meat]]&nbsp;– [[red meat]], [[poultry]], [[seafood]] and the [[flesh]] of any other [[animal]];<!-- NOTE: Specifying what we mean by "meat" is necessary because some people don't consider poultry or seafood to be "real meat," and may think of eating either as still being vegetarian, as has been extensively discussed on the talk page. The specifics regarding this are mentioned lower in the lead and body of the article. --> it may also include abstention from [[by-product]]s of [[animal slaughter]], such as animal-derived [[rennet]] and [[gelatin]].<!-- NOTE: See the sources and past talk page discussions for the addition of by-products of animal slaughter. As many vegetarians are unaware of certain animal-derived products hidden in their foods or do not care if they consume them, and others are vegetarians not for ethical reasons, it was decided that "may also abstain," or some variation of that, is neutral and more accurate wording for this information.--><ref name="vegsoc.org">{{cite web|title=What is a vegetarian?|publisher=The [[Vegetarian Society]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=508}}</ref><ref name="ivu.org">{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Ingredients 1: Gelatine |publisher=[[International Vegetarian Union]] (IVU)|accessdate=February 7, 2013|url=http://www.ivu.org/faq/gelatine.html|quote=Rennet is like gelatin in the sense that it's a common food additive but the foods containing it are often considered vegetarian...

Vegetarianism can be adopted for different reasons. Many [[ethics of eating meat|object to eating meat]] out of respect for [[Sentience|sentient]] life. Such ethical motivations have been codified [[vegetarianism and religion|under various religious beliefs]], along with the concept of [[animal rights]]. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, [[Environmental vegetarianism|environmental]], cultural, aesthetic or [[economic vegetarianism|economic]]. There are varieties of the diet as well: an [[Ovo vegetarianism|ovo-vegetarian]] diet includes eggs but not dairy products, a [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet includes dairy products but not eggs, and an [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|ovo-lacto vegetarian]] diet includes both eggs and dairy products. A [[Veganism|vegan]], or strict vegetarian, diet excludes all [[animal product]]s, including eggs, dairy, beeswax and honey. Vegans also avoid animal products such as leather for clothing and goose-fat for shoe polish.

Various packaged or processed foods, including cake, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, and may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions.<ref name="navs-online.org"/><ref name="vegsoc.org2">{{cite web|title=Things to look out for if you are a vegetarian/vegan|publisher=The [[Vegetarian Society]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=729}}</ref> Often, products are reviewed by vegetarians for animal-derived ingredients prior to purchase or consumption.<ref name="vegsoc.org2"/> Vegetarians vary in their feelings regarding these ingredients, however.

==Etymology==
The [[Vegetarian Society]], founded in Manchester, UK, in 1847, says that the word "vegetarian" is derived from the Latin word ''vegetus'' meaning lively or vigorous.<ref name=vegetus>{{cite web|title=10 quick vegetarian facts... part 1|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/document.doc?id=73|work=Info & advice, Resources, Teacher & student resources, Quick lesson ideas|publisher=Vegetarian Society|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> In contrast, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') and other standard dictionaries state that the word was formed from the term "vegetable" and the suffix "-arian".<ref>''OED'' vol. 19, second edition (1989), p. 476; ''Webster’s Third New International Dictionary'' p. 2537; ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', ''Oxford'', 1966, p. 972; ''The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology'' (1988), p. 1196; Colin Spencer, ''The Heretic's Feast.

==History==
{{Main|History of vegetarianism}}
The earliest records of (lacto) vegetarianism come from ancient [[India]] and [[ancient Greece]] in the 5th century BCE.<ref>Spencer, Colin. ''The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism''. Fourth Estate Classic House, pp. 33–68, 69–84.</ref> In  the Asian instance the diet was closely connected with the idea of [[nonviolence]] towards animals (called ''[[ahimsa]]'' in India) and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers.<ref name="rv">''Religious Vegetarianism From Hesiod to the Dalai Lama'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 13–46.</ref> Among the [[Hellenes]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and others, it had medical or [[Ritual purification]] purposes.

[[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] emperor [[Ashoka]] asserted protection to fauna: {{cquote2|"Twenty-six years after my coronation various animals were declared to be protected – parrots, mainas, ''aruna'', ruddy geese, wild ducks, ''nandimukhas, gelatas'', bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, ''vedareyaka'', ''gangapuputaka'', ''sankiya'' fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, ''okapinda'', wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible.

It re-emerged during the [[Renaissance]],<ref>Spencer p. 180–200.</ref> becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1847, the first [[Vegetarian Society]] was founded in the United Kingdom;<ref>Spencer p. 252–253, 261–262.</ref> Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. The [[International Vegetarian Union]], a union of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the 20th century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns.

==Varieties of vegetarianism==
[[File:Non eggetarian.jpg|thumb |Roadside café near [[Kullu]], India.]]
There are a number of types of vegetarianism, which exclude or include various foods.
*[[Ovo vegetarianism]] includes eggs but not dairy products.
*[[Lacto vegetarianism]] includes dairy products but not eggs.
*[[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism]] (or lacto-ovo vegetarianism) includes animal/dairy products such as eggs, milk, and honey.
*[[Veganism]] excludes all animal flesh and products, such as milk, honey, and eggs, as well as items refined or manufactured through any such product, such as bone-char refined white sugar or animal-tested baking soda.
*[[Raw veganism]] includes only fresh and uncooked fruit, nuts, seeds, and vegetables. Vegetables can only be cooked up to a certain temperature.<ref>[http://www.ivu.org/faq/definitions.html International Vegetarian Union (IVU)]. Retrieved May 2, 2010.</ref>
*[[Fruitarianism]] permits only fruit, nuts, seeds, and other plant matter that can be gathered without harming the plant.<ref>Mangels, AR. [http://www.adajournal.org/article/S0002-8223(09)00700-7/fulltext Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets], Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 2009, vol 109, issue 7, pp. 1266–1282.</ref>
*[[Sattvic diet]] (also known as yogic diet), a plant based diet which may also include dairy (not eggs) and honey, but excludes anything from the [[allium|onion or leek family]], [[lentil|red lentils]], [[Durian|durian fruit]], mushrooms, blue cheeses, fermented foods or sauces, alcoholic drinks and often also excludes coffee, [[tea|black or green tea]], [[cocoa bean|chocolate]], [[nutmeg]] or any other type of stimulant such as excess sharp spices.
*[[Buddhist vegetarianism]]. Different Buddhist traditions have differing teachings on diet, which may also vary for ordained monks and nuns compared to others. Many interpret the [[Five Precepts|precept]] 'not to kill' to require abstinence from meat, but not all.  In Taiwan, su vegetarianism excludes not only all animal products but also vegetables in the [[allium]] family (which have the characteristic aroma of onion and garlic): onion, garlic, scallions, leeks, chives, or shallots.
*[[Jain vegetarianism]] includes dairy but excludes eggs and honey, as well as root vegetables.
*[[Macrobiotic diet]]s consist mostly of [[whole grain]]s and [[bean]]s.

Within the 'ovo-' groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] (with [[balut (egg)|balut]] being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.

Some vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing; for example, sugars that are whitened with [[bone char]], cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the [[collagen]] inside animals' skin, bones and [[connective tissue]]), some [[sugarcane|cane]] sugar (but not [[sugar beet|beet]] sugar) and apple juice/alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of or do not mind such ingredients.<ref name="navs-online.org"/><ref name="Forrest"/><ref name="vegsoc.org2"/><ref name=vrg.org/>

These diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:
* [[pescetarianism]], which includes fish and possibly other forms of seafood;
* pollotarianism, which includes chicken and possibly other poultry;
* "pollo-pescetarian", which includes poultry and fish, or "white meat" only;
* [[macrobiotic diet]]s consisting mostly of whole grains and beans, but may sometimes include fish.

Semi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups who state that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.<ref name=www.vegsoc.org/>

==Health benefits and concerns==

{{Quote box
|quote = In prospective studies of adults, compared to non-vegetarian eating patterns, vegetarian-style eating patterns have been associated with improved health outcomes—lower levels of obesity, a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and lower total mortality. Several clinical trials have documented that vegetarian eating patterns lower blood pressure.

On average, vegetarians consume a lower proportion of calories from fat (particularly saturated fatty acids); fewer overall calories; and more fiber, potassium, and vitamin C than do non-vegetarians. Vegetarians generally have a lower body mass index. These characteristics and other lifestyle factors associated with a vegetarian diet may contribute to the positive health outcomes that have been identified among vegetarians.

====Fatty acids====
Plant-based, or vegetarian, sources of [[Omega 3]] fatty acids include [[soy]], [[walnut]]s, pumpkin seeds, [[canola oil]], [[kiwifruit]], [[hempseed]], [[algae]], [[chia seed]], [[flaxseed]], echium seed and [[Leaf vegetable|leafy vegetables]] such as lettuce, [[spinach]], [[cabbage]] and [[portulaca oleracea|purslane]]. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. [[Olives]] (and [[olive oil]]) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide [[alpha-linolenic acid]] which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma in British meat-eating, vegetarian, and vegan men|author=Rosell MS, Lloyd-Wright Z, Appleby PN, Sanders TA, Allen NE, Key TJ|year=2003|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|pages=327–34|volume=82|pmid=16087975|issue=2}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts.

A 1999 [[Meta-analysis|metastudy]] combined data from five studies from western countries.<ref name="AJCN metastudy">{{Cite journal|title= Mortality in vegetarians and non-vegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies|journal= American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume= 70|issue=3|pages=516S–524S|date = September 1999|url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/70/3/516S|accessdate=October 30, 2009|author= Timothy J Key, Gary E Fraser, Margaret Thorogood, Paul N Appleby, Valerie Beral, Gillian Reeves, Michael L Burr, Jenny Chang-Claude, Rainer Frentzel-Beyme, Jan W Kuzma, Jim Mann and Klim McPherson |pmid= 10479225}}</ref> The metastudy reported [[mortality ratio]]s, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and [[veganism|vegans]] shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the "lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: "...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from [[ischaemic heart disease]] than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established".<ref name="AJCN metastudy"/>

In ''Mortality in British vegetarians'',<ref name="AJCN British study">{{cite journal|last1=Key|first1=TJ|last2=Appleby|first2=PN|last3=Davey|first3=GK|last4=Allen|first4=NE|last5=Spencer|first5=EA|last6=Travis|first6=RC|title=Mortality in British vegetarians: review and preliminary results from EPIC-Oxford.|journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition|volume=78|issue=3 Suppl|pages=533S–538S|year=2003|pmid=12936946}}</ref> a similar conclusion is drawn: "British vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Appleby|first1=PN|last2=Key|first2=TJ|last3=Thorogood|first3=M|last4=Burr|first4=ML|last5=Mann|first5=J|title=Mortality in British vegetarians.|journal=Public health nutrition|volume=5|issue=1|pages=29–36|year=2002|pmid=12001975|doi=10.1079/PHN2001248}}</ref>

The Adventist Health Study is an ongoing study of life expectancy in [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that "the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The [[life expectancy]] of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.<ref>Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, ''[http://www.llu.edu/pages/news/today/july2601/llu.html New Adventist Health Study research noted in Archives of Internal Medicine]'', Loma Linda University, July 26, 2001. Retrieved January 9, 2010.</ref>

The Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled "Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?" published in ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that "The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy." However, the study also concluded that "Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians." It further states that "This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet." In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that "5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=PN|coauthors=Sabaté J, Fraser GE|title=Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=2003|volume=78|issue=3|pages=526S-532S|pmid=12936945|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/526S.long|accessdate=28 September 2012}}</ref>

==Ethics and diet==

===General===
{{Main|Ethics of eating meat}}
Various ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural [[taboo]], such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as [[factory farms]], or avoid certain meats, such as [[veal]] or [[foie gras]]. Some people follow vegetarian or [[Veganism|vegan]] diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. [[factory farming]] and the industrialisation of [[animal slaughter]]. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant [[protein]].

Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain [[Intensive farming|agricultural practices]] surrounding the [[animal husbandry|production]] of meat.

=== Ethics of killing for food ===
{{Main|Bioethics}}
[[Princeton University]] professor and founder of the [[animal rights movement]], [[Peter Singer]], believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals to eat as against killing humans to eat. Singer, in his book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under [[utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]], and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutritional value is not sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behaviour in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|page=103|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}
</ref>

Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This does not excuse cruelty, but it does mean animals are not [[Moral equivalence|morally equivalent]] to humans and do not possess the rights a human has.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SH2b |title=Animals and Ethics [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>

=== Milk and eggs ===
One of the main differences between a vegan and a [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|typical vegetarian diet]] is the avoidance of both eggs and [[dairy product]]s such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. [[Veganism#Ethical_veganism|Ethical vegans]] do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering and/or a premature death.<ref name=marcus>{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|year=2000|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

To produce milk from [[dairy cattle]], calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and slaughtered or fed milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption.<ref name=milk>{{cite web|title=Dairy Cows & Welfare |author=Vegetarian Society|date=|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=556}}</ref> Vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond.<ref name=milk /> Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for [[veal]] production.<ref name=milk /> To prolong [[lactation]], dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through [[artificial insemination]].<ref name=milk /> After about five years, once the cows milk production has dropped, they are considered "spent" and sent to slaughter for hamburger meat and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.<ref name=marcus />

=== Treatment of animals ===
{{main|Animal rights}}
Ethical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of [[factory farming]], faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Mistreatment of animals has been discovered in some large mass-production plants which is a reason people become vegetarians. Accounts such as the Land O' Lakes supplier undercover investigation where findings of mistreatment of animals, abuse, and lack of medical treatment have been uncovered.<ref>[http://www.causes.com/actions/1680289-land-o-lakes-supplier-undercover-investigation "Land O' Lakes Supplier Undercover Investigation."] Causes. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Feb. 2013.</ref>

===Classical Greek and Roman philosophy===
Ancient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. [[Pythagoras]] was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be. 

Roman writer [[Ovid]] concluded his magnum opus [[Metamorphoses]], in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]], into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.

{{cquote2|Everything changes; nothing dies; the soul roams to and fro, now here, now there, and takes what frame it will, passing from beast to man, from our own form to beast and never dies...Therefore lest appetite and greed destroy the bonds of love and duty, heed my message!

Vegetarianism is not a common practice in current Christian culture. However, the [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] founded by Reverend [[William Cowherd]] in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet.<ref name=desc>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The Bible Christian Church|publisher=International Vegetarian Union}}</ref> Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the [[Vegetarian Society]].<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=827|title=History of Vegetarianism – Early Ideas|publisher=The Vegetarian Society|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}; Gregory, James (2007) ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians''.

[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ova-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC).

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Diet in Hinduism}}

Most major paths of [[Hinduism]] hold vegetarianism as an ideal. There are three main reasons for this: the principle of nonviolence ([[ahimsa]]) applied to animals;<ref>Tähtinen, Unto: ''Ahimsa. Non-Violence in Indian Tradition'', London 1976, p. 107–109.</ref> the intention to offer only "pure" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as [[prasad]];{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and the conviction that a [[sattvic diet|sentient diet]] is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and dairy products, so they are lacto-vegetarians.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

However, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community and according to regional traditions. Historically and currently, those [[Hindus]] who eat meat prescribe [[Jhatka]] meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2004/10/21/stories/2004102100111600.htm |title=The Hindu : Sci Tech / Speaking Of Science : Changes in the Indian menu over the ages |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=October 21, 2004 |accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

Followers of Islam, or Muslims, have the freedom of choice to be vegetarian for medical reasons or if they do not personally like the taste of meat. However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.<ref name="Muslims can’t be vegetarian">[http://ipaki.com/content/html/28/1203.html Muslims can’t be vegetarian?] Retrieved May 16, 2008</ref>

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism}}
Followers of [[Jainism]] believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death.<ref>[http://www.jainstudy.org/JSC6.02-Vegetarianism.htm "Vegetarianism Good For The Self And Good For The Environment"] at [http://www.jainstudy.org/ The Jain Study Circle]</ref><ref>[http://www.vsc.org/spiritual.htm "Spiritual Traditions and Vegetarianism"]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}} at the [http://www.vsc.org/index.htm Vegetarian Society of Colorado] website.</ref> Some particularly dedicated individuals are [[fruitarianism|fruitarians]].<ref>Matthews, Warren: ''World Religions'', 4th edition, Belmont: Thomson/Wadsworth 2004, p. 180.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish vegetarianism}}
[[File:BikurimS.jpg|thumb|Basket of fresh fruit and vegetables grown in [[Israel]]]]
While it is neither required nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] (e.g., [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]]) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not just because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits. Therefore, their concern was with regard to possible harmful effects upon human character rather than with animal welfare. Indeed, Rabbi Joseph Albo maintains that renunciation of the consumption of meat for reasons of concern for animal welfare is not only morally erroneous but even repugnant.<ref name="innernet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107.html |title=J. David Bleich – Contemporary Halakhic Problems |publisher=Innernet.org.il |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>

One modern-day scholar who is often cited as in favour of vegetarianism is the late Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], the Chief Rabbi of [[British Mandate for Palestine|Mandate]] [[Palestine]]. In his writings, Rabbi Kook speaks of vegetarianism as an ideal, and points to the fact that Adam did not partake of the flesh of animals. In context, Rabbi Kook makes those comments in his portrayal of the eschatological (messianic) era. However, he personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals, and one of his leading disciples, Rabbi [[David Cohen (rabbi)|David Cohen]], known as the "[[Nazirite]]" of Jerusalem, was a devout vegetarian. Several other members of Rabbi Kook's circle were also vegetarians.

According to some [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]], only a mystic, who is able to sense and elevate the reincarnated human souls and "divine sparks", is permitted to consume meat, though eating the flesh of an animal might still cause spiritual damage to the soul. A number of Orthodox Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the [[halakha|halakhic]] permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishveg.com/torah.html |title=Judaism & Vegetarianism |publisher=Jewishveg.com |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>

<ref>[http://www.europeanvegetarian.org/evu/english/news/news974/jewish.html Jewish philosophy of vegetarianism] article by Philip L. Pick</ref> The Torah also commands people to ritually slaughter animals when killing them, and goes into precise detail on the rituals of both animal sacrifice and ordinary slaughter ([[shechita]]). According to medieval sage Rabbi [[Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz]], author of the Torah commentary [[Kli Yakar]], the complexity of these laws was intended to discourage the consumption of meat.<ref>"The Vision of Eden: Animal Welfare and Vegetarianism" in "Jewish Law and Mysticism", Orot 2003</ref>

Within the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness. The most orthodox eat only "[[Ital]]" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari.<ref>Osborne, L (1980), ''The Rasta Cookbook'', 3rd ed.

==Environment and diet==
{{Main|Environmental vegetarianism}}
Environmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through [[factory farming]], is [[environmentalism|environmentally]] [[sustainable development|unsustainable]]. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a "massive scale" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM |title=Livestock's Long Shadow – Environmental issues and options |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>

In addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents.  Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.<ref>EPA.  2011.  Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990–2009.  United States Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA 430-R-11-005.  459 pp.</ref>  This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.

Meat produced in a laboratory (called [[in vitro meat]]) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926635.600-comment-growing-m |title=Comment: Lab-grown meat could ease food shortage |last=Olsson |first=Anna |periodical= New Scientist |publication-date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=November 17, 2008}}</ref> Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: "A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/nov/11/food.climatechange Why eating less meat could cut global warming] Guardian</ref>

In May 2009, [[Ghent]], Belgium, was reported to be "the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a "weekly meatless day". Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report. Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and "veggie street maps" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants. In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly ''veggiedag'' ("vegetarian day") too.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm "Belgian city plans 'veggie' days"], Chris Mason, BBC, May 12, 2009</ref>

==Labor conditions and diet==
Some groups, such as [[PETA]], promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary meat industry.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.goveg.com/workerrights.asp|title=Killing for a Living: How the Meat Industry Exploits Workers|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref> These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing.<ref name="labor">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/4.htm |title=Worker Health and Safety in the Meat and Poultry Industry |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref><ref name="labor2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncrlc.com/academic-SR-webpages/food_safety.html |title=Food Safety, the Slaughterhouse, and Rights |publisher=Ncrlc.com |date=March 30, 2004 |accessdate=August 9, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223175929/http://www.ncrlc.com/academic-SR-webpages/food_safety.html |archivedate = December 23, 2007}}</ref><ref name="labor3">[http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/contentPages/docs/meatCultureLiteratureReviewV81.pdf Positive Safety Culture.

==Economics and diet==
Similar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of [[economic vegetarianism]]. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious [[simple living]] strategy or just out of necessity. According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], "Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry."<ref>Worldwatch Institute, News July 2, 1998, [https://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02 United States Leads World Meat Stampede]</ref>

==Demographics==
A research study conducted on more than 8,000 people, and published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', suggested that children with an above-average IQ may have a higher chance of becoming vegetarians in their adulthood.<ref>[http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2006/dec/06_138.shtml Children with a high IQ are more likely to become vegetarian :: University of Southampton]. Soton.ac.uk (December 15, 2006). Retrieved on May 25, 2011.</ref>

===Gender===
A 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation claimed that "of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n210/ai_16019829 |title=The gender gap: if you're a vegetarian, odds are you're a woman. Why? |accessdate=October 27, 2007 |date=February 1, 2005 |publisher=[[Vegetarian Times]]}}</ref>

At least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies. A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 "found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls".<ref name="Babies">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/869696.stm |title='More girl babies' for vegetarians |publisher=BBC News |date=August 7, 2000 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association has dismissed this as a "statistical fluke".<ref name="Babies" />
