It lies immediately behind the [[retina]]. It [[Reflection (physics)|reflects]] visible [[light]] back through the retina, increasing the light available to the [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], though blurring the initial image of the light on focus. The tapetum lucidum contributes to the superior [[night vision]] of some animals. Many of these animals are [[nocturnality|nocturnal]], especially [[carnivore]]s that hunt their [[prey]] at night, while others are [[deep sea]] animals.

Similar adaptations occur in some species of [[spider]]s, although these are not the result of tapetum lucidum. Most of primates, including humans, lack tapetum lucidum, and compensate for it by perceptive recognition methods and ocular irises.

==Eyeshine==

'''Eyeshine''' is a visible effect of the ''tapetum lucidum''. When light shines into the eye of an animal having a ''tapetum lucidum'', the [[pupil]] appears to glow. Eyeshine can be seen in many animals, in nature and in [[Flash (photography)|flash]] [[photograph]]s. In low light, a hand-held flashlight is sufficient to produce eyeshine that is highly visible to humans (despite our inferior [[night vision]]); this technique, [[spotlighting]], is used by naturalists and hunters to search for animals at night. Eyeshine occurs in a wide variety of [[color]]s including [[white]], [[blue]], [[green]], [[yellow]], [[pink]] and [[red]]. However, since eyeshine leads to [[iridescence]], the color varies slightly with the angle at which it is seen and the color of the source light.

White eyeshine occurs in many fish, especially [[walleye]]; blue eyeshine occurs in many mammals such as [[horse]]s; green eyeshine occurs in mammals such as [[cats]], [[dogs]], and [[raccoon]]s; and red eyeshine occurs in [[rodents]], [[opossum]]s and [[bird]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}<!-- what about crocodiles? -->

Despite it being present in [[Strepsirrhini|some primates]], the human eye has no ''tapetum lucidum'', hence no eyeshine. However, in humans and animals two effects can occur that may resemble eyeshine: ''[[leukocoria]]'' (white shine, indicative of abnormalities including [[cataract]]s, [[cancer]]s, and other problems) and [[red-eye effect]].

===Blue-eyed cats and dogs===
[[Image:Astrid com orelhonas-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Odd-eyed cat with eyeshine, plus red-eye effect in one eye]]
<!-- [[Image:Bi-eyehusky2.jpg|thumb|Heterochromatic dog with red-eye effect in blue eye]] -->

Cats    and dogs with blue eyes (see [[eye color]]) may display both eyeshine and red-eye effect. Both species have a tapetum lucidum, so their pupils may display eyeshine. In [[Flash (photography)|flash]] color photographs, however, individuals with blue eyes may also display a distinctive red eyeshine. Individuals with [[heterochromia]] may display red eyeshine in the blue eye and normal yellow/green/blue/white eyeshine in the other eye. These include [[odd-eyed cat]]s and [[Heterochromia iridum|bi-eyed dogs]]. The red-eye effect is independent of the eyeshine: in some photographs of individuals with a tapetum lucidum and heterochromia, the eyeshine is dim yet the pupil of the blue eye still appears red. This is most apparent when the individual is not looking into the camera, because the tapetum lucidum is far less extensive than the retina.

==Classification==
A [[Biological classification|classification]] of anatomical variants of tapeta lucida<ref name="Ollivier+2004"/><!-- classification is not Ollivier's; dates from 1967 or before --> defines 4 types:
*''Retinal tapetum'', as seen in [[teleost]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[marsupial]]s and [[fruit bat]]s. The tapetum lucidum is within the [[retina]]; in the other 3 types the tapetum is within the choroid behind the retina.

When a ''tapetum lucidum'' is present, its location on the eyeball varies with the placement of the eyeball in the head,<ref name="Lee1886">{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Henry |year=1886 |title=On the Tapetum Lucidum |journal=Med Chir Trans |pmid=20896672 |volume=69 |pages=239–245 |pmc=2121549}}</ref> such that in all cases the tapetum lucidum enhances [[night vision]] in the center of the animal's [[field of view]].

Apart from its eyeshine, the ''tapetum lucidum'' itself has a color. It is often described as iridescent. In [[tiger]]s it is greenish.<ref>Fayrer, Sir Joseph (1889) ''The deadly wild beasts of India'', pages 218–240 in James Knowls (ed)

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Calf-Eye-Posterior-With-Retina-Detached-2005-Oct-13.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Choroid dissected from a calf's eye, tapetum lucidum appearing iridescent blue]]
The ''tapetum lucidum'', which is [[iridescent]], reflects light roughly on the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] principles of [[thin-film optics]], as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the ''tapetum lucidum'' cells are [[Chromatophore#Iridophores and leucophores|leucophore]]s, not [[Chromatophore#Iridophores and leucophores|iridophore]]s.

The ''tapetum lucidum'' is a [[retroreflector]] of the [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[sphere]] type. Because it is a retroreflector, it reflects light directly back along the light path. This serves to match the original and reflected light, thus maintaining the sharpness and contrast of the image on the retina. The ''tapetum lucidum'' reflects with [[Interference (wave propagation)|constructive interference]],<ref name="Locket1974"/> thus increasing the quantity of light passing through the retina. In the cat, the ''tapetum lucidum'' lowers the minimum threshold of vision 6-fold, allowing the cat to see light that is invisible to human eyes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=GUNTER R, HARDING HG, STILES WS |title=Spectral reflexion factor of the cat's tapetum |journal=Nature |volume=168 |issue=4268 |pages=293–4 |year=1951 |month=August |pmid=14875072 |doi= 10.1038/168293a0|url= |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

==Uses==
The ''tapetum lucidum'' enables an animal with it to see in dimmer light than the animal would otherwise be able to. This is of use to the animal, but it is of use also to humans. Human uses include scanning for reflected eyeshine to detect and identify the species of animals in the dark, and deploying trained [[search dog]]s and [[search and rescue horse|search horse]]s at night. Historically, its function was regarded as simply to increase the light intensity of an image on the retina.<ref>[[Robley Dunglison|Dunglison, Robley]] (1854) ''Medical lexicon'', Blanchard and Lea, 903 pages, page 843. [http://books.google.com/books?id=NOCL44dvZrgC Free full text in Google Books]</ref>

Using eyeshine to identify animals in the dark employs not only its color but also several other features. The color corresponds approximately to the type of tapetum lucidum, with some variation between species. Other features include the distance between pupils relative to their size; the height above ground; the manner of blinking (if any); and the movement of the eyeshine (bobbing, weaving, hopping, leaping, climbing, flying).

Manufactured retroreflectors modeled after a tapetum lucidum are described in numerous patents and today have many uses. The earliest patent, first used in [[Cat's eye (road)|"Catseye"]] brand [[raised pavement marker]]s, was inspired by the tapetum lucidum of a cat's eye. A more recent use of retroreflectors, helping to provide secure communications between two stations in [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], is modeled after the combination of tapetum lucidum and [[bioluminescent]] "flashlight" in [[flashlight fish]] of the families [[Anomalopidae]] and [[Stomiidae]] (see [[Retroreflector]]). Some of these fish have been shown<ref name="pmid1413559">{{cite journal |author=Howland HC, Murphy CJ, McCosker JE |title=Detection of eyeshine by flashlight fishes of the family Anomalopidae |journal=Vision Res. |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=765–9 |year=1992 |month=April |pmid=1413559 |doi= 10.1016/0042-6989(92)90191-K|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0042-6989(92)90191-K |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> to use eyeshine both to detect and to communicate with other flashlight fish.

==Pathology==
In dogs, certain drugs are known to disturb the precise organization of the crystals of the tapetum lucidum, thus compromising the dog's ability to see in low light. These drugs include [[ethambutol]], [[macrolide]] antibiotics, [[dithizone]], [[antimalarial medication]]s, some receptor H(sub)2-antagonists, and cardiovascular agents. The disturbance "is attributed to the chelating action which removes zinc from the tapetal cells."<ref>{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Gerald D. |title=Target organ toxicity |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=1986 |pages=121–122 |isbn=0-8493-5776-4}}</ref>
