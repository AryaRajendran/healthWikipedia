[[Image:Vaginoplasty.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'''Vaginoplasty:''' the pre-operative aspect (left), and the post-operative aspect (right) of a [[Labiaplasty|labial reduction]].]]
'''Vaginoplasty''' is a reconstructive [[plastic surgery]] and cosmetic procedure for the [[vagina]]l canal and its mucous membrane, and of vulvo-vaginal structures that might be absent or damaged because of [[congenital disease]] (e.g. [[vaginal atresia]]) or because of an acquired cause (e.g. childbirth [[physical trauma]], [[cancer]]). As such, the term '''vaginoplasty''' generally describes any such cosmetic reconstructive and corrective vaginal surgery, whilst the term '''neovaginoplasty''' specifically describes the procedures of either partial or total construction or reconstruction of the vulvo-vaginal complex. Sometimes referred to as "vaginal rejuvenation”, “aesthetic vaginal surgery” or “cosmetic vaginal surgery”, various results aim to strengthen the function of the vulvo-vaginal area, firm up and reshape tissue for youthful appearances. In regular terms, the procedure is essentially a “face lift” for the vulva and vagina.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.urogyn.org/aestheticvaginal.html |title=Labiaplasty, Vaginoplasty, Female Genital Surgery, Vaginal Cosmetic Surgery |publisher=Urogyn.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> Vaginal rejuvenation is often two combined distinct surgeries of labiaplasty and vaginoplasty, to restore or enhance the vagina's cosmetic appearance or function. Labiaplasty is a labia reduction and cosmetic enhancement genital surgical procedure to reduce or change the shape of the labia minora (small lips) on the outside of the vagina. Some surgeries are needed for discomfort occurring from chronic labial irritation that develops from tight clothing, sex, sports or other physical activities. Vaginoplasty surgery is done by removing excess vaginal lining and tightening the surrounding soft tissues and muscles.<ref>[http://www.centerforvaginalsurgery.com/nyclabiaplasty/vaginalrejuvenationnyc.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> The post-operative outcome of vaginoplasty is variable; it usually allows coitus (sexual intercourse) after a week, although sensation might not always be present. In fertile women, [[menstruation]] and [[fertilization]] are assured when the [[uterus]] and the [[ovary|ovaries]] have preserved their normal functions; in a few cases, [[vaginal childbirth]] is possible.

In male-to-female [[sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]], some [[trans women]] patients undergo vaginoplasty as part of their physical (sex) [[Transitioning (transgender)|transition]]. Sexual activity is also possible, although with a much longer post-operative delay (usually around six weeks). Sensation is usually very good. One important difference regarding vaginoplasty on trans women is the need to dilate the vagina. A few days after surgery, the vaginal stent is removed and a long series of vaginal dilation begins. A set of dilators is used during each dilation, each one with an increasing large width. For roughly the first week or two, and sometimes up to a month, dilation is performed several times a day using the smaller dilators. It can then be tapered off gradually, becoming once per day, then every other day, and then once per week, all while working up to the larger dilators. Eventually, it can be slowed down to once per month, and use of only one dilator (of the larger widths from the set) is the goal. Some trans women find they require dilation even less, even once every couple of months, depending on experience and individual physiology. However, it is important to note that waiting too long between dilations (the exact time depending on post-operative time and individual physiology) leads to increased difficulty restarting dilation. Vaginal dilation is also required for life, and sexual activity (including intercourse) in place of dilation may not be sufficient. The physical factors that limit vaginal dimensions are the [[Rectoprostatic fascia|rectoprostatic Denonvilliers’ Fascia]] (depth) and the [[Levator ani|Levator ani muscle]] (diameter); thus, in trans women patients, the narrowness of the male [[pelvis]] can reduce the available area to use for vaginoplasty.

==Terminology==
The term "vaginoplasty" also is applied to [[hymenotomy]], the creation of an opening in an [[imperforate hymen]], and [[hymenorrhaphy]], the  recreation of a ruptured [[hymen]].

== Vaginoplastic procedures ==
'''Vaginoplasty''' utilizes [[Autotransplantation|autologous]] (patient-derived) [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] from the patient’s person, to construct areas of vagina and areas of the vulvovaginal complex. The tissues available for surgical correction include the [[oral mucosa]], [[skin flap]]s, [[skin graft]]s, the vaginal [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], [[penis|penile]] skin, penile tissue, [[scrotum|scrotal]] skin, and [[intestine|intestinal mucosa]]. In surgical praxis, it is important to [[Electrolysis|electrolytically]] remove the follicles from a hair-bearing skin graft, unless the surgeon directs otherwise; usually, the skin graft is depilated intra-operatively, either manually (scraped) or by electrocauterization. Besides the vaginoplastic [[Plastic surgery|surgery]] techniques herein discussed, earlier plastic surgery procedures do exist, but have been superseded by the more effective results (outcome) of contemporary vaginoplasty.

=== Balloon vaginoplasty ===
In the balloon vaginoplasty technique, a [[foley catheter]] is [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]] inserted to the rectouterine pouch whereupon gradual traction and distension are applied to create a neovagina.<ref name=saman2007/><ref name=saman2010>{{cite journal |author=El Saman AM |title=Retropubic Balloon Vaginoplasty for Management of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=2016–2019 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=19200986 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.046 |url=}}</ref> Moreover, balloon vaginoplasty also is a new technique for treating vaginal [[aplasia]], which also is applied as a technically simple, physically safe, and medically effective alternative vaginoplasty for creating a neovagina, especially when conventional laparoscopic surgery is either infeasible or unsafe.<ref name=saman2007>{{cite journal |author=El Saman AM, Fathalla MM, Nasr AM, Youssef MA |title=Laparoscopically Assisted Balloon Vaginoplasty for Management of Vaginal Aplasia |journal=International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=134–137 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17572428 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2007.04.013 |url=}}</ref>

=== Buccal (oral) mucosa ===
A relatively novel surgical approach to treating [[vaginal agenesis]] is utilizing the [[buccal mucosa]] as the tissue for lining the [[vagina]] (ca. 8.0&nbsp;cm. deep). The medical advantages of this vaginoplasty technique include the biological and healing qualities of the buccal [[Mucous tissue|mucosa tissue]], minimal scarring, and a short, post-operative recovery for the patient. The disadvantages include limited vaginal dimensions (depth and width), and the possibility of either [[Mouth|intraoral]] damage, when tissue-harvesting, or of [[medical complication|complications]].<ref>[http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/3/604 Use of Autologous Buccal Mucosa for Vaginoplasty: a Study of Eight Cases] by Lin WC, Chang CYY, Shen YY, Tsai HD. Human Reproduction, Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 604–607, March 2003</ref> 

In surgery, the tissue donor site in the cheek (ca. 2.5 x 8.0&nbsp;cm.) is marked to avoid damage to the [[Parotid duct|Stensen’s duct]] (parotid duct) and to the [[parotid gland]]. To create the vaginal lining, the buccal mucosa tissue graft is micro-perforated to allow shaping it to a larger size of greater area (surface); it then is formed upon a [[stent]], and afterwards affixed to the vaginal space (created earlier in the operation), with its edge [[Surgical suture|sutured]] to the [[labia minora|minor labia]] and to the [[Perinium|perineal skin]]. The vaginal mold of buccal mucosa is then (temporarily) secured to the perineal skin, to allow the patient’s recovery.

=== Colovaginoplasty ===
The [[colovaginoplasty]] (colon section) technique creates a [[vagina]] by cutting away a section of the [[sigmoid colon]] and using it to form a vaginal lining. This surgery is performed on women with [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], [[vaginal agenesis]], [[müllerian agenesis]], and other [[intersexual]] conditions wherein non-invasive forms of deepening the vagina cannot be performed (mostly on trans women patients) as an alternative to penile inversion, with or without an accompanying skin graft (usually from the thigh or the abdomen). Because of the potential [[Complications (medical)|complications]] (e.g. diversion [[colitis]]) most surgeons will recommend a colovaginoplasty procedure only when there is no alternative procedure.

===Don Flap (labia minora flap)===
The Don Flap correction of vaginal [[agenesis]], uses a technique similar to that of penile inversion, that [[Surgical suture|sutures]] the [[labia minora]] together to create a neovagina. A refinement of this vaginoplsatic technique is its utilization of the [[clitoral hood|prepucial skin]] (hood) of the [[clitoris]] as a horse-shoe-shaped, one-piece flap. Yet, although the Don Flap technique is a relatively simple surgical procedure, the most obvious disadvantages of the labia minora flap surgery include the need for restorative [[labiaplasty]] and [[cervical dilation]] to produce a vagina of adequate dimensions (depth and width).<ref>[http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/bjps/article/S0007-1226%2805%2900123-2/abstract Horse shoe flap Vaginoplasty — a New Technique of Vagina Reconstruction with Labia minora flaps for Primary Vaginal Agenesis]. Purushothaman V. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery. Volume 58, Issue 7, pp. 934–939 October 2005</ref>

=== McIndoe technique ===
The McIndoe vaginoplasty technique utilizes split-thickness skin grafts that cover a mold, which then is inserted to a surgically created space, between the [[bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. The principal, technical difference between the McIndoe vaginoplasty and the Vecchietti vaginoplasty, is ''which'' tissue to utilize to line the created [[vagina|neovagina]]. Each surgical procedure has positive and negative factors, especially regarding upon whom such a plastic surgical technique can be applied, because the post-operative outcome varies with the patient’s indications.

=== Penile inversion ===
In [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|genital reassignment]], penile inversion is the most common plastic surgical technique for creating a neovagina for trans women patients; it also is used for the genital corrections for people born [[intersex]]. Along with the [[#Colovaginoplasty|colovaginoplasty]] procedure, penile inversion is one of the two principal vaginoplasty procedures used for creating a neovagina. Applying a flap technique (first used by Sir [[Harold Gillies]] in 1951), the spongiform erectile tissue of the [[penis]] is removed, and the skin, with its nerves and vascular system (blood supply) still attached, is used to create a vestibule area and [[labia minora]], which then are inverted into the neovaginal cavity created in the pelvic tissue. Part of the [[glans penis]] tip, with its nerve and vascular systems still connected, becomes the [[clitoris]]; and the [[urethra]] is shortened to end at a place appropriate to the [[vulva|female genital anatomy]]. Another common technique for creating a neoclitoris utilizes the urethral spongiform tissue. This was the most common penile inversion technique, and was so used by Dr. Burou and Dr. Stanley Biber; however, some surgeons do not create a neoclitoris as part of a penile inversion.

=== Vecchietti procedure ===
In treating [[müllerian agenesis]], the Vecchietti procedure is a [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]] surgical technique that produces a [[vagina]] of dimensions (depth and width) comparable to those of a normal vagina (ca. 8.0&nbsp;cm. deep).<ref>Vecchietti G. Creation of an Artificial Vagina in Rokitansky–Kster–Hauser Syndrome. Attual Ostet Ginecol 1965;11:131–147</ref><ref>Fedele L, Bianchi S, Tozzi L, Borruto F, Vignali M. A New Laparoscopic Procedure for Creation of a Neovagina in Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser Syndrome. Fertility and Sterility 1996;66:854–857</ref> A small, plastic sphere (“olive”) is threaded ([[Surgical suture|sutured]]) against the vaginal area; the threads are drawn though the vaginal skin, up through the [[abdomen]], and through the [[navel]]. There, the threads are attached to a traction device, and then daily are drawn tight so that the “olive” is pulled inwards and stretches the vagina, by approximately 1.0&nbsp;cm. per day, thereby creating a vagina, approximately 7.0&nbsp;cm. deep by 7.0&nbsp;cm. wide, in 7 days. The mean operating room (OR) time for the Vecchietti vaginoplasty is approximately 45 minutes; yet, depending upon the patient and her indications, the procedure might require more time.<ref>[http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/NR/rdonlyres/07C53DB9-6C67-4375-86B4-DB9DF42635AD/21989/VecchiettiProcedure.pdf University College University Hospitals > Vecchietti Procedure] Retrieved 3 April 2010</ref>

=== Wilson Method ===
The penile-inversion technique of the Wilson Method is different from the traditional penile-inversion technique in that it is a three-stage surgery, comprising a two-stage initial vaginoplasty.<ref>[http://www.wpath.org/journal/www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/IJT/97-03/numbers/symposion/ijtvo06no04_01.htm The Aesthetic Vulva: Perineal Cosmesis in the Male-to-Female Transsexual] Wilson N. IJT Volume 6, Number 4, 2002</ref> The Wilson Method surgery is initially performed like a traditional penile inversion, until the vaginal-vault creation step, in which the vault of the vagina is left unfinished, as a raw surface, and is packed with a sterile [[stent]], which, after 5–7 days, then is lined with a skin graft harvested from the [[buttocks]]. The [[penis|penile]] skin is used to create the [[labia minora]], [[clitoral hood]]ing, and the [[Frenulum of labia minora|anterior fourchette]] (frenulum); the [[glans penis]] is used to create the [[clitoris]], and the [[scrotum]] is used to create the [[labia majora]].

===Labiaplasty===
[[Labiaplasty]] is a vaginoplastic surgery technique for reducing the size the [[labia (genitalia)|genital labia]] — either the [[labia majora|majora]] or the [[labia minora|minora]] — which are any of the four folds of tissue of the [[vulva]].<ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary">[http://documentarystorm.com/sexuality/the-perfect-vagina/ The Perfect Vagina Documentary] Retrieved {{Nowrap|13 February 2011}}.</ref> It can be performed as a discrete surgery, or as a subordinate procedure within a vaginoplasty.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21346521 | doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e31820d6867 | volume=68 | issue=2 | title=Current trends in vaginal labioplasty: a survey of plastic surgeons | year=2012 | month=February | author=Mirzabeigi MN, Moore JH, Mericli AF, ''et al.'' | journal=Ann Plast Surg | pages=125–34}}</ref>

===Vaginal rejuvenation===
A “vaginal rejuvenation” is a non-reconstructive vaginoplasty that restores the muscle tone and the esthetics of the [[vagina]], by removing excess tissues and tightening the supportive structures of the vulvovaginal complex, in effort either to reduce or to reverse the effects of aging and parturition ([[childbearing]]). The advantages are a physically comfortable health and an improved [[self-image]] (mental health); the potential disadvantages are decreased [[Clitoris|clitoral]] and genital sensation, and [[Complications (medical)|complications]], such as [[infection]], tissue adhesions, and [[scar]]ring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://womenshealthnews.wordpress.com/2007/08/31/vaginal-rejuvenation-not-proven-safe-or-necessary/ |title=Vaginal “Rejuvenation” Not Safe or Necessary « Women's Health News |publisher=Womenshealthnews.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ([[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]]) published ''Committee Opinion No. 378: Vaginal “Rejuvenation” and Cosmetic Vaginal Procedures'' (2007), the college’s formal policy statement of opposition to the [[Advertising|commercial misrepresentations]] of labiaplasty, and associated vaginoplastic procedures, as medically “accepted and routine surgical practices”. The ACOG doubted the medical safety and the therapeutic efficacy of the surgical techniques and procedures for performing labiaplasty, vaginal rejuvenation, the [[designer vagina]], revirgination, and [[G-spot|Gräfenberg Spot]] amplification, and recommended that women seeking such genitoplastic surgeries must be fully informed, with the available surgical-safety statistics, of the potential health risks of surgical-wound [[infection]], of [[pudendal nerve]] damage (resulting in either an insensitive or an over-sensitive vulva), of [[dyspareunia]] (painful coitus), of tissue adhesions ([[epidermoid cyst]]s), and of painful scars.<ref name="Vaginal">{{cite journal|author = American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|year = 2007|title = Vaginal "Rejuvenation" and Cosmetic Vaginal Procedures|url = http://www.newviewcampaign.org/userfiles/file/ACOG%20gen.cosm.surg.pdf
