{{otheruses|Bookmark (disambiguation)}}
In [[genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], '''bookmarking''' is a biological phenomenon believed to function as an epigenetic mechanism for transmitting [[cellular memory]] of the pattern of [[gene expression]] in a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], throughout [[mitosis]], to its daughter cells. This is vital for maintaining the [[phenotype]] in a lineage of cells so that, for example, liver cells divide into liver cells and not some other cell type.

It is characterized by non-compaction of some [[gene promoter]]s during [[mitosis]]. In terms of mechanism, it is believed that:

* at some point prior to the onset of [[mitosis]], the [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]] of genes that exist in a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]-competent state become "marked" in some way,
* this "mark" persists both during and after [[mitosis]], and
* the marking transmits gene expression memory by preventing the mitotic compaction of DNA at this locus, or by facilitating reassembly of transcription complexes on the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], or both.

In some cases, bookmarking is mediated by binding of specific factors to the promoter prior to onset of mitosis, but in other cases could be mediated by patterns of [[histone]] modification or presence of histone variants that are characteristic of active genes, and which are believed to persist throughout [[mitosis]].

In the case of specific genes,  for example, the stress-inducible ''[[hsp70]]'' gene, bookmarking may also function as a mechanism for ensuring that the gene can be transcribed early in [[G1 phase]] if a stress were to occur at that time. If this gene promoter were compacted it would take time to de-compact in G1, during which time the cell would be unable to transcribe this cytoprotective gene, leaving it vulnerable to stress-induced cell death.  In this case, bookmarking appears to be important for cell survival.
