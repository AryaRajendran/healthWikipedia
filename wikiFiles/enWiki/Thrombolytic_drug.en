'''Thrombolytic drugs''' are used in [[medicine]] to dissolve [[thrombus|blood clots]] in a procedure termed ''[[thrombolysis]]''. They limit the damage caused by the blockage or [[occlusion]] of a [[blood vessel]].

==Uses==
Thrombolytic agents are used for the treatment of [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[Stroke#Ischemic|thromboembolic strokes]], [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] to clear a blocked artery and avoid permanent damage to the perfused (see [[perfusion]]) tissue (e.g. [[myocardium]], [[human brain|brain]], [[human leg|leg]]) and [[death]]. They may also be used to clear blocked [[catheter]]s that are used in long-term medical therapy.

Thrombolytic therapy in [[Stroke#Hemorrhagic|hemorrhagic stroke]]s is [[contraindicated]], as its use in that situation would prolong bleeding into the [[intracranial space]] and cause further damage.

==Members==
The thrombolytic drugs include:
*[[tissue plasminogen activator]] t-PA:
      
:* [[alteplase]] ([[Activase]])
:*[[reteplase]] ([[Retavase]])
:*[[tenecteplase]] ([[TNKase]])
*[[anistreplase]] ([[Eminase]])
*[[streptokinase]] ([[Kabikinase]], [[Streptase]])
*[[urokinase]] ([[Abbokinase]])

These drugs are most effective if administered immediately after it has been determined they are clinically appropriate. The advantage of administration is highest within the first sixty minutes after a thrombotic event, but may extend up to six hours after the start of symptoms.

These drugs are often administered in combination with [[anticoagulant drug]]s such as [[intravenous]] [[heparin]] or [[low molecular weight heparin]], for synergistic [[antithrombotic]] effects and secondary prevention.

==Side-effects==
Hemorrhagic stroke is a rare but serious complication of thrombolytic therapy. If a patient has had thrombolysis before, an allergy against the thrombolytic drug may have developed (especially after [[streptokinase]]). If the symptoms are mild, the infusion is stopped and the patient is commenced on an [[antihistamine]] before infusion is recommenced. [[Anaphylaxis]] generally requires immediate cessation of thrombolysis.
