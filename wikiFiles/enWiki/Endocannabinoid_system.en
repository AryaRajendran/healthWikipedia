The '''endocannabinoid system''' refers to a group of neuromodulatory [[lipid]]s and their [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s that are involved in a variety of physiological processes including [[appetite]], [[nociception|pain-sensation]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[memory]]; it mediates the psychoactive effects of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and, broadly speaking, includes:

* The endogenous [[arachidonic acid|arachidonate]]-based lipids, [[anandamide]] (''N''-arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA) and [[2-arachidonoylglycerol]] (2-AG); these are known as "[[endocannabinoids]]" and are physiological [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] for the cannabinoid receptors. Endocannabinoids are all [[eicosanoid]]s.<ref name="Pertwee2006">{{cite pmid|16570099}}</ref>
* The enzymes that synthesize and degrade the endocannabinoids, such as [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] or [[monoacylglycerol lipase]].
* The [[cannabinoid receptor]]s [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor type 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]], two [[G protein-coupled receptors]] that are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

The endocannabinoid system has been studied using genetic and pharmacological methods.

==Basic overview==

===Expression of receptors===
Cannabinoid binding sites exist throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The two most relevant receptors for cannabinoids are the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors, which are expressed predominantly in the brain and immune system respectively.<ref name="Pertwee2008">{{cite pmid|17828291}}</ref> Density of expression varies based on species and correlates with the efficacy that cannabinoids will have in modulating specific aspects of behavior related to the site of expression. For example, in rodents, the highest concentration of cannabinoid binding sites are in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, regions of the brain involved in the initiation and coordination of movement.<ref name="Elphick2001">{{cite pmid|11316486}}</ref> In humans, cannabinoid receptors exist in much lower concentration in these regions, which helps explain why cannabinioids possess a greater efficacy in altering rodent motor movements than they do in humans. For a more thorough description of receptor localization, see [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor type 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]].

A recent analysis of cannabinoid binding in CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptor knockout-mice found cannabinoid responsiveness even when these receptors were not being expressed, indicating that an additional binding receptor may be present in the brain.<ref name="Elphick2001" /> Binding has been demonstrated by [[2-arachidonoylglycerol]] (2-AG) on the [[TRPV1]] receptor suggesting that this receptor may be a candidate for the established response.<ref name="Puente2011">{{cite pmid|22057189}}</ref>

===Endocannabinoid synthesis, release, and degradation===

During neurotransmission, the pre-synaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters into the [[synaptic cleft]] which bind to cognate receptors expressed on the post-synaptic neuron.  Based upon the interaction between the transmitter and receptor, neurotransmitters may trigger a variety of effects in the post-synaptic cell, such as excitation, inhibition, or the initiation of [[second messenger system|second messenger]] cascades. Based on the cell, these effects may result in the on-site synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids [[anandamide]] or 2-AG by a process that is not entirely clear, but results from an elevation in intracellular calcium.<ref name="Pertwee2008" /> Expression appears to be exclusive, so that both types of endocannabinoids are not co-synthesized. This exclusion is based on synthesis-specific channel activation: a recent study found that in the bed nucleus of the [[stria terminalis]], calcium entry through voltage-sensitive calcium channels produced an L-type current resulting in 2-AG production, while activation of [[metabotropic glutamate receptor 1|mGluR1/5]] receptors triggered the synthesis of anandamide.<ref name="Puente2011" />

Evidence suggests that the depolarization-induced influx of calcium into the post-synaptic neuron causes the activation of an enzyme called [[transacylase]]. This enzyme is suggested to catalyze the first step of endocannabinoid biosynthesis by converting [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], a membrane-resident phospholipid, into [[N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine]] (NAPE). Experiments have shown that [[phospholipase D]] cleaves NAPE to yield anandamide.<ref>{{cite pmid|14634025}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16938887}}</ref> In NAPE-phospholipase D ([[NAPEPLD]])-knockout mice, cleavage of NAPE is reduced in low calcium concentrations, but not abolished, suggesting multiple, distinct pathways are involved in anandamide synthesis.<ref>{{cite pmid|16605240}}</ref> The synthesis of 2-AG is less established and warrants further research.

Once released into the extracellular space by a putative endocannabinoid transporter, messengers are vulnerable to [[glial cell]] inactivation.  Endocannabinoids are taken up by a transporter on the glial cell and degraded by [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] (FAAH), which cleaves anandamide into [[arachidonic acid]] and [[ethanolamine]] or [[monoacylglycerol lipase]] (MAGL), and 2-AG into arachidonic acid and glycerol.<ref>{{cite pmid|15936805}}</ref> While arachidonic acid is a substrate for [[leukotriene]] and [[prostaglandin]] synthesis, it is unclear whether this degradative byproduct has novel functions in the [[central nervous system]] (Yamaguchi et al., 2001; Brock, T., 2005). Emerging data in the field also points to FAAH being expressed in postsynaptic neurons complementary to presynaptic neurons expressing cannabinoid receptors, supporting the conclusion that it is major contributor to the clearance and inactivation of anandamide and 2-AG after endocannabinoid reuptake.<ref name="Elphick2001" /> A neuropharmacological study demonstrated that an inhibitor of FAAH (URB597) selectively increases anandamide levels in the brain of rodents and primates. Such approaches could lead to the development of new drugs with analgesic, anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like effects, which are not accompanied by overt signs of abuse liability.<ref>Clapper J. R., Mangieri R. A., Piomelli D. (2009). "The endocannabinoid system as a target for the treatment of cannabis dependence." ''Neuropharmacology'' 56, 235–243. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390808002761 doi:10.1016/j.neuropharm.2008.07.018.] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18691603 PMID 18691603]</ref> 

Notably, a series of recent studies have found that the expression of endocannabinoids does not correlate with the distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the brain, suggesting that these molecules may also be interacting with other receptors or be involved with other cell processes.<ref name="Elphick2001" />

===Binding and intracellular effects===

Cannabinoid receptors are G-coupled Protein receptors located on the pre-synaptic membrane. While there have been some papers that have linked concurrent stimulation of [[dopamine]] and CB<sub>1</sub> receptors to an acute rise in [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) production, it is generally accepted that CB<sub>1</sub> activation via cannabinoids causes a decrease in cAMP concentration by inhibition of [[adenylyl cyclase]] and a rise in the concentration of [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAP kinase).<ref name="Pertwee2006" /><ref name="Elphick2001" /> The relative potency of different cannabinoids in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase correlates with their varying efficacy in behavioral assays. This inhibition of cAMP is followed by phosphorylation and subsequent activation of not only a suite of MAP kinases ([[P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38]]/[[MAPK1|p42]]/[[ERK1|p44]]), but also the [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3]]/[[Protein Kinase B|PKB]] and [[MAPK/ERK pathway|MEK/ERK pathway]] (Galve-Roperh et al., 2002; Davis et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2006). Results from rat hippocampal [[gene chip]] data after acute administration of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) showed an increase in the expression of [[myelin basic protein]], endoplasmic proteins, [[cytochrome oxidase]], and two cell adhesion molecules: [[NCAM]], and [[SC1]]; decreases in expression were seen in both [[calmodulin]] and [[ribosomal RNA]]s (Kittler et al., 2000). In addition, CB1 activation has been demonstrated to increase the activity of transcription factors like [[c-Fos]] and [[Krox-24]] (Graham et al., 2006).

===Binding and neuronal excitability===

The molecular mechanisms of CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated changes to the membrane voltage have also been studied in detail. CB<sub>1</sub> agonists reduce calcium influx by blocking the activity of voltage-dependent [[N-type calcium channel|N-]], [[P-type calcium channel|P]]/[[Q-type calcium channel|Q-]] and [[L-type calcium channel|L-type]] [[calcium channel]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Twitchell W, Brown S, Mackie K |title=Cannabinoids inhibit N- and P/Q-type calcium channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |year=1997 |pmid=9242259 |doi=}}</ref><ref name=Guo>{{cite journal |author=Guo J, Ikeda SR |title=Endocannabinoids modulate N-type calcium channels and G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels via CB1 cannabinoid receptors heterologously expressed in mammalian neurons |journal=Mol. Pharmacol. |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=665–74 |year=2004 |pmid=14978245 |doi=10.1124/mol.65.3.665}}</ref> In addition to acting on calcium channels, activation of [[G protein-coupled receptors|Gi/o and Gs]], the two most commonly coupled G-proteins to cannabinoid receptors, has been shown to modulate [[potassium channel]] activity.  Recent studies have found that CB<sub>1</sub> activation specifically facilitates [[G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel|GIRK]], a potassium channel belonging to the [[Kir3]] family.<ref name=Guo />  Both Guo & Ikeda and Binzen et al. performed a series of immunohistochemistry experiments that demonstrated CB<sub>1</sub> co-localized with GIRK and [[KCNA4|Kv1.4]] potassium channels, suggesting that these two may interact in physiological contexts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Binzen U, Greffrath W, Hennessy S, Bausen M, Saaler-Reinhardt S, Treede RD |title=Co-expression of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.4 with transient receptor potential channels (TRPV1 and TRPV2) and the cannabinoid receptor CB<sub>1</sub> in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons |journal=Neuroscience |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=527–39 |year=2006 |pmid=16889902 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.06.020}}</ref>

In the central nervous system, CB<sub>1</sub> receptors influence neuronal excitability reducing the incoming synaptic input.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freund TF, Katona I, Piomelli D |title=Role of endogenous cannabinoids in synaptic signaling |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=1017–66 |year=2003 |pmid=12843414 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00004.2003 |doi_brokendate=2010-07-25}}</ref>
This mechanism, known as [[presynaptic inhibition]], occurs when a postsynaptic neuron releases endocannabinoids in retrograde transmission, which then bind to cannabinoid receptors on the presynaptic terminal. CB<sub>1</sub> receptors then reduce the amount of neurotransmitter released, so that subsequent excitation in the presynaptic neuron results in diminished effects on the postsynaptic neuron. It is likely that presynaptic inhibition uses many of the same ion channel mechanisms listed above, although recent evidence has shown that CB<sub>1</sub> receptors can also regulate neurotransmitter release by a non-ion channel mechanism, i.e. through Gi/o mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and [[Protein Kinase A]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chevaleyre V, Heifets BD, Kaeser PS, Südhof TC, Purpura DP, Castillo PE |title=ENDOCANNABINOID-MEDIATED LONG-TERM PLASTICITY REQUIRES cAMP/PKA SIGNALING AND RIM1α |journal=Neuron |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=801–12 |year=2007 |pmid=17553427 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.05.020 |pmc=2001295}}</ref>
Still, direct effects of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors on membrane excitability have been reported, and strongly impact the firing of cortical neurons<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bacci A, Huguenard JR, Prince DA |title=Long-lasting self-inhibition of neocortical interneurons mediated by endocannabinoids |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7006 |pages=312–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15372034 |doi=10.1038/nature02913|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..312B }}</ref>
In a series of behavioral experiments, Palazzo et al. demonstrated that [[NMDA]], an ionotropic [[glutamate receptor]], and the [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]]s (mGluRs) work in concert with CB<sub>1</sub> to induce analgesia in mice, although the mechanism underlying this effect is unclear. Together, these findings suggest that CB<sub>1</sub> influences neuronal excitability by a variety of mechanisms, and these effects are relevant to perception and behavior.

==Functions of the endocannabinoid system==

===Memory===

Mice treated with [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) show suppression of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, a process that is essential for the formation and storage of long-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hampson RE, Deadwyler SA |title=Cannabinoids, hippocampal function and memory |journal=Life Sci. |volume=65 |issue=6–7 |pages=715–23 |year=1999 |pmid=10462072 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(99)00294-5}}</ref>  These results concur with anecdotal evidence suggesting that smoking [[Cannabis]] impairs short-term memory<ref name=Pertwee2001>{{cite journal |author=Pertwee RG |title=Cannabinoid receptors and pain |journal=Prog. Neurobiol. |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=569–611 |year=2001 |pmid=11164622 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(00)00031-9}}</ref>  Consistent with this finding, mice without the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor show enhanced [[memory]] and [[long-term potentiation]] indicating that the endocannabinoid system may play a pivotal role in the extinction of old memories.  In contrast, a recent study found that the high-dose treatment of rats with the synthetic cannabinoid [[HU-210]] over several weeks resulted in stimulation of neural growth in the rats' [[Hippocampus#Role in general memory|hippocampus]] region, a part of the limbic system playing a part in the formation of [[declarative memory|declarative]] and [[Hippocampus#Role in spatial memory and navigation|spatial memories]].<ref name=Jiang2005>{{cite journal |author=Jiang W |title=Cannabinoids promote embryonic and adult hippocampus neurogenesis and produce anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=115 |issue=11 |pages=3104–16 |year=2005 |pmid=16224541 |doi=10.1172/JCI25509 |pmc=1253627 |author-separator=, |author2=Zhang Y |author3=Xiao L |display-authors=3 |last4=Van Cleemput |first4=J |last5=Ji |first5=SP |last6=Bai |first6=G |last7=Zhang |first7=X}}</ref> Taken together, these findings suggest that the effects of endocannabinoids on memory are dependent on what type of neurons are being targeted (excitatory vs. inhibitory) and the location of these networks in the brain.

====Role in hippocampal neurogenesis====

In the adult brain, the endocannabinoid system facilitates the [[neurogenesis]] of hippocampal [[granule cells]].<ref name=Jiang2005/><ref name=Aguado2005>{{cite journal |author=Aguado T |title=The endocannabinoid system drives neural progenitor proliferation |journal=FASEB J. |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1704–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16037095 |doi=10.1096/fj.05-3995fje |author-separator=, |author2=Monory K |author3=Palazuelos J |display-authors=3 |last4=Stella |first4=N |last5=Cravatt |first5=B |last6=Lutz |first6=B |last7=Marsicano |first7=G |last8=Kokaia |first8=Z |last9=Guzmán |first9=M}}</ref> In the [[subgranular zone]] of the [[dentate gyrus]], multipotent neural progenitors (NP) give rise to [[daughter cell]]s that, over the course of several weeks, mature into granule cells whose axons project to and synapse onto  dendrites on the [[Cornu Ammonis region 3|CA3]] region.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christie BR, Cameron HA |title=Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus |journal=Hippocampus |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=199–207 |year=2006 |pmid=16411231 |doi=10.1002/hipo.20151}}</ref>  NPs in the hippocampus have been shown to possess FAAH and express CB<sub>1</sub> and utilize 2-AG.<ref name=Aguado2005/>  Intriguingly, CB<sub>1</sub> activation by endogenous or exogenous cannabinoids promote NP proliferation and differentiation; this activation is absent in CB<sub>1</sub> knockouts and abolished in the presence of antagonist.<ref name=Jiang2005/><ref name=Aguado2005/>

====Induction of synaptic depression====
The inhibitory effects of cannabinoid receptor stimulation on neurotransmitter release have caused this system to be connected to various forms of depressant plasticity. A recent study conducted with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis found that the endurance of the depressant effects was mediated by two different signaling pathways based on the type of receptor activated. 2-AG was found to act on presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub> receptors to mediate retrograde [[short-term depression]] (STD) following activation of L-type calcium currents, while anandamide was synthesized after mGluR5 activation and triggered [[autocrine signalling]] onto postsynapic [[TRPV1]] receptors that induced [[long-term depression]] (LTD). Similar post-synaptic receptor dependencies were found in the striatum, but here both effects relied on presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub> receptors.<ref name="Puente2011" />  These findings provide the brain a direct mechanism to selectively inhibit neuronal excitability over variable time scales. By selectively internalizing different receptors, the brain may limit the production of specific endocannabinoids to favor a time scale in accordance with its needs.

===Appetite===

Evidence for the role of the endocannabinoid system in food-seeking behavior comes from a variety of cannabinoid studies. Emerging data suggests that THC acts via CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in the hypothalamic nuclei to directly increase appetite.<ref name="Kirkham TC, Tucci SA 2006 272–92">{{cite journal |author=Kirkham TC, Tucci SA |title=Endocannabinoids in appetite control and the treatment of obesity |journal=CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=272–92 |year=2006 |pmid=16787229 |doi=10.2174/187152706777452272}}</ref> It is thought that hypothalamic neurons tonically produce endocannabinoids that work to tightly regulate [[hunger]]. The amount of endocannabinoids produced is inversely correlated with the amount of [[leptin]] in the blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Di Marzo V |title=Trick or treat from food endocannabinoids? |journal=Nature |volume=396 |issue=6712 |pages=636–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9872309 |doi=10.1038/25267 |author-separator=, |author2=Sepe N |author3=De Petrocellis L |display-authors=3 |last4=Berger |first4=Alvin |last5=Crozier |first5=Gayle |last6=Fride |first6=Ester |last7=Mechoulam |first7=Raphael|bibcode = 1998Natur.396..636D }}</ref>  For example, mice without leptin not only become massively obese but express abnormally high levels of hypothalamic endocannabinoids as a compensatory mechanism.<ref name=DiMarzo>{{cite journal |author=Di Marzo V |title=Leptin-regulated endocannabinoids are involved in maintaining food intake |journal=Nature |volume=410 |issue=6830 |pages=822–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11298451 |doi=10.1038/35071088 |author-separator=, |author2=Goparaju SK |author3=Wang L |display-authors=3 |last4=Liu |first4=Jie |last5=Bátkai |first5=Sándor |last6=Járai |first6=Zoltán |last7=Fezza |first7=Filomena |last8=Miura |first8=Grant I. |last9=Palmiter |first9=Richard D.}}</ref>  Similarly, when these mice were treated with an endocannabinoid inverse agonists, such as [[rimonabant]], food intake was reduced.<ref name=DiMarzo />  When the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is knocked-out in mice, these animals tend to be leaner and less hungry than wild-type mice. A related study examined the effect of THC on the hedonic value of food and found enhanced dopamine release in the [[nucleus accumbens]] and increased pleasure-related behavior after administration of a sucrose solution.<ref>{{cite pmid|22063718}}</ref>  A related study found that endocannabinoids affect taste perception in taste cells <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ryusuke Yoshida |title=Endocannabinoids selectively enhance sweet taste |journal=PNAS |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=935–9 |year=2010 |pmid=20080779 |pmc=2818929 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0912048107 |author-separator=, |display-authors=1 |last2=Ohkuri |first2=T. |last3=Jyotaki |first3=M. |last4=Yasuo |first4=T. |last5=Horio |first5=N. |last6=Yasumatsu |first6=K. |last7=Sanematsu |first7=K. |last8=Shigemura |first8=N. |last9=Yamamoto |first9=T. |bibcode = 2010PNAS..107..935Y }}</ref>  In taste cells, endocannabinoids were shown to selectively enhance the strength of neural signaling for sweet tastes, whereas leptin decreased the strength of this same response. While there is need for more research, these results suggest that cannabinoid activity in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens is related to appetitive, food-seeking behavior.<ref name="Kirkham TC, Tucci SA 2006 272–92"/>

===Energy balance & metabolism===
The endocannabinoid system has been shown to have a [[homeostatic]] role by controlling several metabolic functions, such as energy storage and nutrient transport. It acts on peripheral tissues such as [[adipocytes]], [[hepatocytes]], the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[skeletal muscles]] and the endocrine [[pancreas]]. It has also been implied in modulating [[insulin sensitivity]]. Through all of this, the endocannabinoid system may play a role in clinical conditions, such as [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], and [[atherosclerosis]], which may also give it a [[cardiovascular]] role.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01728.x/full</ref>

===Stress response===
While the secretion of [[glucocorticoids]] in response to stressful stimuli is an adaptive response necessary for an organism to respond appropriately to a stressor, persistent secretion may be harmful. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the habituation of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) to repeated exposure to restraint stress. Studies have demonstrated differential synthesis of anandamide and 2-AG during tonic stress. A decrease of anandamide was found along the axis that contributed to basal hypersecretion of [[corticosterone]]; in contrast, an increase of 2-AG was found in the amygdala after repeated stress, which was negatively correlated to magnitude of the corticosterone response. All effects were abolished by the CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist [[AM251]], supporting the conclusion that these effects were cannabinoid-receptor dependent.<ref>{{cite pmid|20439721}}</ref>  These findings show that anandamide and 2-AG divergently regulate the HPA axis response to stress: while habituation of the stress-induced HPA axis via 2-AG prevents excessive secretion of glucocorticoids to non-threatening stimuli, the increase of basal corticosterone secretion resulting from decreased anandamide allows for a facilitated response of the HPA axis to novel stimuli.

====Exploration, social behavior, and anxiety====
Prolonged, systemic exposure to cannabinoids has often been associated with anti-social effects. To investigate this theory, a cannabinoid receptor-knockout mouse study examined the effect that these receptors play on exploratory behavior. Researchers selectively targeted glutamatergic and [[GABA]]ergic cortical interneurons and studied results in open field, novel object, and sociability tests. Eliminating glutamaterigic cannabinoid receptors led to decreased object exploration, social interactions, and increased aggressive behavior. In contrast, GABAergic cannabinoid receptor-knockout mice showed increased exploration of objects, socialization, and open field movement.<ref>{{cite pmid|22069458}}</ref> These contrasting effects reveal the importance of the endocannabinoid system in regulating [[anxiety]]-dependent behavior. Results suggest that glutamatergic cannabinoid receptors are not only responsible for mediating aggression, but produce an anxiolytic-like function by inhibiting excessive arousal: excessive excitation produces anxiety that limited the mice from exploring both animate and inanimate objects. In contrast, GABAergic neurons appear to control an anxiogenic-like function by limiting inhibitory transmitter release. Taken together, these two sets of neurons appear to help regulate the organism's overall sense of arousal during novel situations.

===Immune function===

Evidence suggests that endocannabinoids may function as both neuromodulators and immunomodulators in the immune system. Here, they seem to serve an autoprotective role to ameliorate muscle spasms, inflammation, and other symptoms of [[multiple sclerosis]] and skeletal muscle spasms.<ref name="Pertwee2006" /> Functionally, the activation of cannabinoid receptors has been demonstrated to play a role in the activation of [[GTPase]]s in [[macrophage]]s, [[neutrophil]]s, and [[BM cell]]s. These receptors have also been implicated in the proper migration of [[B cell]]s into the [[marginal zone]] (MZ) and the regulation of healthy [[IgM]] levels.<ref>{{cite pmid|22048769}}</ref> Interestingly, some disorders seem to trigger an [[upregulation]] of cannabinoid receptors selectively in cells or tissues related to symptom relief and inhibition of disease progression, such as in that rodent neuropathic pain model, where receptors are increased in the spinal cord microglia, dorsal root ganglion, and thalmic neurons.<ref name="Pertwee2008" />

====Multiple sclerosis====
Historical records from ancient China and Greece suggest that preparations of ''Cannabis Indica'' were commonly prescribed to ameliorate multiple sclerosis-like symptoms such as tremors and muscle pain. Modern research has confirmed these effects in a study on diseased mice, wherein both endogenous and exogenous agonists showed ameliorating effects on tremor and spasticity.  It remains to be seen whether pharmaceutical preparations such as [[dronabinol]] have the same effects in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baker D |title=Cannabinoids control spasticity and tremor in a multiple sclerosis model |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6773 |pages=84–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10716447 |doi=10.1038/35003583 |author-separator=, |author2=Pryce G |author3=Croxford JL |display-authors=3 |last4=Brown |first4=Peter |last5=Pertwee |first5=Roger G. |last6=Huffman |first6=John W. |last7=Layward |first7=Lorna}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Baker D |title=Endocannabinoids control spasticity in a multiple sclerosis model |journal=FASEB J. |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=300–2 |year=2001 |pmid=11156943 |doi=10.1096/fj.00-0399fje |author-separator=, |author2=Pryce G |author3=Croxford JL |display-authors=3 |last4=Brown |first4=P |last5=Pertwee |first5=RG |last6=Makriyannis |first6=A |last7=Khanolkar |first7=A |last8=Layward |first8=L |last9=Fezza |first9=F}}</ref> Due to increasing use of medical Cannabis and rising incidence of multiple sclerosis patients who self-medicate with the drug, there has been much interest in exploiting the endocannabinoid system in the cerebellum to provide a legal and effective relief.<ref name=Pertwee2001/> In mouse models of multiple sclerosis, there is a profound reduction and reorganization of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in the cerebellum.<ref name=Cabranes2006>{{cite pmid|16822488}}</ref>  Serial sections of cerebellar tissue subjected to [[immunohistochemistry]] revealed that this aberrant expression occurred during the relapse phase but returned to normal during the remitting phase of the disease.<ref name=Cabranes2006/> Other studies suggest that CB<sub>1</sub> agonists promote the survival of [[oligodendrocyte]]s [[in vitro]] in the absence of growth and trophic factors; in addition, these agonist have been shown to promote mRNA expression of myelin lipid protein.

Taken together, these studies point to the exciting possibility that cannabinoid treatment may not only be able to attenuate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis but also improve oligodendrocyte function (reviewed in Pertwee, 2001; Mollna-Holgado et al., 2002).  2-AG stimulates proliferation of a [[microglia]]l cell line by a CB<sub>2</sub> receptor dependent mechanism, and the number of microglial cells is increased in multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/65/4/999|title=Cultured Rat Microglial Cells Synthesize the Endocannabinoid 2-Arachidonylglycerol, Which Increases Proliferation via a CB2 Receptor-Dependent Mechanism}} 0026-895X/04/6504-999-1007 Mol Pharmacol 65:999-1007, 2004</ref>

===Female reproduction===

The developing [[embryo]] expresses cannabinoid receptors early in development that are responsive to anandamide secreted in the [[uterus]]. This signaling is important in regulating the timing of embryonic implantation and uterine receptivity. In mice, it has been shown that anandamide modulates the probability of implantation to the uterine wall. For example, in humans, the likelihood of miscarriage increases if uterine anandamide levels are too high or low.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maccarrone M, Valensise H, Bari M, Lazzarin N, Romanini C, Finazzi-Agrò A |title=Relation between decreased anandamide hydrolase concentrations in human lymphocytes and miscarriage |journal=Lancet |volume=355 |issue=9212 |pages=1326–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10776746 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02115-2}}</ref> These results suggest that intake of exogenous cannabinoids (e.g. [[marijuana]]) can decrease the likelihood for pregnancy for women with high anandamide levels, and alternatively, it can increase the likelihood for pregnancy in women whose anandamide levels were too low.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Das SK, Paria BC, Chakraborty I, Dey SK |title=Cannabinoid ligand-receptor signaling in the mouse uterus |journal=Proc.

===Autonomic nervous system===
Peripheral expression of cannabinoid receptors led researchers to investigate the role of cannabinoids in the [[autonomic nervous system]]. Research found that the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is expressed presynaptically by motor neurons that innervate visceral organs. Cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of electric potentials results in a reduction in noradrenaline release from [[sympathetic nervous system]] nerves. Other studies have found similar effects in endocannabinoid regulation of intestinal motility, including the innervation of smooth muscles associated with the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems.<ref name="Elphick2001" />

===Analgesia===
At the spinal cord, cannabinoids suppress noxious-stimulus-evoked responses of neurons in the dorsal horn, possibly by modulating descending [[noradrenergic|noradrenaline]] input from the brainstem.<ref name="Elphick2001" /> As many of these fibers are primarily GABAergic, cannabinoid stimulation in the spinal column results in disinhibition that should increase noradrenaline release and attenuation of noxious-stimuli-processing in the periphery and [[dorsal root ganglion]]. The endocannabinoid most researched in pain is [[palmitoylethanolamide]] . Palmitoylethanolamide is a fatty amine related to anandamide, but saturated and although initially it was thought that palmitoylethanolamide would bind to the CB1 and the CB2 receptor, later it was found that the most important receptors are the PPAR-alpha receptor, the TRPV receptor and the GRP55 receptor. [http://www.benthamscience.com/open/topainj/articles/V005/12TOPAINJ.pdf Palmitoylethanolamide has been evaluated for its analgesic actions in a great variety of pain indications] and found to be safe and effective. Basically these data are proof of concept for endocannabinoids and related fatty amines to be therapeutically useful analgesics; palmitoylethaanolamide is available under the brandnames Normast and PeaPure as neutraceuticals.

===Thermoregulation===
[[Anandamide]] and [[N-arachidonoyl dopamine]] (NADA) have been shown to act on temperature-sensing [[TRPV1]] channels, which are involved in thermoregulation.<ref name="pmid14517174">{{cite journal | author = Ross RA | title = Anandamide and vanilloid TRPV1 receptors | journal = Br.

===Sleep===
Increased endocannabinoid signaling within the [[central nervous system]] promotes sleep-inducing effects. [[ventricular system|Intercerebroventricular]] administration of anandamide in rats has been shown to decrease wakefulness and increase [[slow-wave sleep]] and [[REM sleep]].<ref>Murillo-Rodríguez E, Sánchez-Alavez M, Navarro L, Martínez-González D, Drucker-Colín R, Prospéro-García O.

==Experimental use of CB1 -/- phenotype==

Neuroscientists often utilize transgenic CB<sub>1</sub> knock-out mice to discern novel roles for the endocannabinoid system. While CB<sub>1</sub> knock-out mice are healthy and live into adulthood,  there are significant differences between CB<sub>1</sub> knock-out and wild-type mice. When subjected to a high-fat diet, CB<sub>1</sub> knockout mice tend to be about sixty percent leaner and slightly less hungry than wildtype.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ravinet Trillou C, Delgorge C, Menet C, Arnone M, Soubrié P |title=CB1 cannabinoid receptor knockout in mice leads to leanness, resistance to diet-induced obesity and enhanced leptin sensitivity |journal=Int.
