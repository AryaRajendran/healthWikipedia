The '''mandible''' <ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=mandib01&word=mandible&text=%5C%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eman-d%C9%99-b%C9%99l%5C# Mandible on www.merriam-webster.com]</ref> [[pronunciation]] (from Latin ''mandibula'', "jawbone") or '''inferior maxillary bone''' forms the lower [[jaw]] and holds the lower [[tooth|teeth]] in place. The term "mandible" also refers to both the upper and lower sections of the [[beak]]s of [[bird]]s; in this case the '''"lower mandible"''' corresponds to the mandible of humans, while the "upper mandible" is functionally equivalent to the human [[maxilla]] but mainly consists of the [[premaxilla]]ry bones. Conversely, in [[bony fish]] for example, the lower jaw may be termed '''"lower maxilla"'''.

==Components==
The mandible consists of:
* a curved, horizontal portion, the ''body''. (See [[body of mandible]]).
* two perpendicular portions, the ''rami'', which unite with the ends of the body nearly at right angles. (See [[ramus mandibulae]]). The angle formed at this junction is called gonial angle.
* Alveolar process, the tooth bearing area of the mandible (upper part of the body of the mandible)
* [[Condyloid process|Condyle]], superior (upper) and posterior projection from the ramus, which makes the [[temporomandibular joint]] with the [[temporal bone]]
* [[Coronoid process of the mandible|Coronoid process]], superior and anterior projection from the ramus. This provides attachment to the [[temporalis muscle]]

==Foramina (singular = foramen)==
* [[Mandibular foramen]], paired, in the inner (medial) aspect of the mandible, superior to the mandibular angle in the middle of the ramus.
* Mental foramen, paired, lateral to the mental protuberance on the body of mandible.

==Nerves==
[[File:Panoramicfilm.JPG|450px|thumb|right|A panoramic radiographic reveals the mandible, including the heads and necks of the [[mandibular condyles]], the [[coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]]es of the mandible, as well as the [[nasal antrum]] and the [[maxillary sinus]]es.]]
[[Inferior alveolar nerve]], branch of the mandibular division of Trigeminal (V) nerve, enters the mandibular foramen and runs forward in the mandibular canal, supplying sensation to the teeth. At the mental foramen the nerve divides into two terminal branches: incisive and mental nerves. The incisive nerve runs forward in the mandible and supplies the anterior teeth. The mental nerve exits the mental foramen and supplies sensation to the lower lip.

==Sexual dimorphism==
Males generally have squarer, stronger, and larger mandibles than females.

==  Articulations ==
The mandible articulates with the ''two'' [[temporal bone]]s at the [[temporomandibular joint]]s.

== Pathologies ==
One fifth of [[face|facial]] [[injury|injuries]] involve mandibular [[fracture]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levin L, Zadik Y, Peleg K, Bigman G, Givon A, Lin S |title=Incidence and severity of maxillofacial injuries during the Second Lebanon War among Israeli soldiers and civilians|journal= J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=1630–3 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18634951 |doi= 10.1016/j.joms.2007.11.028|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WKF-4T0F864-K&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e05fa24fcd1ba3f710eea659d919b6eb|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Mandibular fractures are often accompanied by a 'twin fracture' on the [[contralateral]] (opposite) side.

The mandible may be dislocated anteriorly (to the front) and inferiorly (downwards) but very rarely posteriorly (backwards).
