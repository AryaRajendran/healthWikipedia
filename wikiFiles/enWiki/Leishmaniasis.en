'''Leishmaniasis''' is a [[disease]] caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s that belong to the genus ''[[Leishmania]]'' and is transmitted by the bite of certain species of [[sand fly]] (subfamily [[Phlebotominae]]). Although the majority of the literature mentions only one genus transmitting ''Leishmania'' to humans (''[[Lutzomyia]]'') in the US, a 2003 study by Galati suggested a new classification for American sand flies, elevating several subgenera to the genus level. Elsewhere in the world, the genus ''[[Phlebotomus]]'' is considered the vector of leishmaniasis.<ref name="Myler2008">{{Cite book| author = Myler P; Fasel Nhirf;f). | title = Leishmania: After The Genome | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | page = {{Page needed|date=September 2010}} |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/leish | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/leish  isbn = 978-1-904455-28-8]}}</ref>

Most forms of the disease are transmissible only from animals ([[zoonosis]]),  but some can be spread between humans. Human infection is caused by about 21 of 30 species that infect mammals{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}: the different species are morphologically indistinguishable, but they can be differentiated by [[isoenzyme]] analysis, DNA [[sequence analysis]], or [[monoclonal antibodies]].

[[Cutaneous leishmaniasis]] is the most common form of leishmaniasis. [[Visceral leishmaniasis]] is a severe form in which the parasites migrate to the vital organs.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Leishmaniasis ulcer.jpg|thumb|right|Cutaneous leishmaniasis ulcer on left forearm]]
The symptoms of leishmaniasis are [[skin sores]] which erupt weeks to months after the person affected is bitten by sand flies. Other consequences, which can manifest anywhere from a few months to years after infection, include fever, damage to the [[spleen]] and [[liver]], and [[anemia]].

In clinical [[medicine]], leishmaniasis is considered one of the classic causes of a markedly enlarged (and therefore palpable) spleen; the organ, which is not normally felt during examination of the abdomen, may become larger even than the liver in severe cases.

Leishmaniasis may be divided into the following types:<ref name="Andrews">{{Cite book|author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= {{Page needed|date=September 2010}} |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|422–428}}

*[[Visceral leishmaniasis]] is the most serious form, and is potentially fatal if untreated.
*[[Cutaneous leishmaniasis]] is the most common form, which causes a sore at the bite site, which heals in a few months to a year, leaving an unpleasant-looking scar.  This form can progress to any of the other three forms.
*[[Cutaneous leishmaniasis|Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis]] produces widespread skin lesions which resemble leprosy, and is particularly difficult to treat.
*Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis commences with skin ulcers which spread, causing tissue damage, to, particularly, the nose and mouth.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Leishmaniasis life cycle diagram en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Life cycle of ''Leishmania'']]
Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of female phlebotomine sandflies.  The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals '''(1)'''.  Metacyclic [[promastigotes]] that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages '''(2)''' and transform into [[amastigotes]] '''(3)'''.  Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on which ''Leishmania'' species is involved '''(4)'''.  These differing tissue specificities cause the differing clinical manifestations of the various forms of leishmaniasis.  Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes '''(5,6)'''.  In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes '''(7)''', which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis '''(8)'''.

Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with the [[pathogen]] ''[[Leishmania]]''. The [[genome]]s of three ''Leishmania'' [[species]] (''L. major'', ''L. infantum'', and ''L. braziliensis'') have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the [[parasite]]. For example, in ''Leishmania'', protein-coding genes are understood to be organized as large polycistronic units in a head-to-head or tail-to-tail manner; RNA polymerase II transcribes long polycistronic messages in the absence of defined RNA pol II promoters, and ''Leishmania'' has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for urgently needed drugs and aid the development of vaccines.<ref name="Myler2008" />

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Leishmania 2009-04-14 smear.JPG|thumb|right|Bone marrow aspirate smear: visceral leishmaniasis]]
Leishmaniasis is diagnosed in the haematology laboratory by direct visualization of the [[amastigotes]] (Leishman-Donovan bodies). [[Buffy-coat]] preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide to make a thin smear and stained with Leishman's or Giemsa's stain ([[pH]] 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen with monocytes or, less commonly in neutrophils, of peripheral blood and in macrophages in aspirates. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped [[kinetoplast]]. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Dacie, John V.; Bain, Barbara J.; Imelda Bates |title=Dacie and Lewis practical haematology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |pages={{Page needed|date=September 2010}} |isbn=0-443-06660-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and it can be difficult to identify the infected cells. For these reasons, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed. These methods include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen coated dipsticks, and the direct agglutination test (DAT). Although these tests are readily available, they are not the standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity. Over the years, several different Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays are made into use for the detection of Leishmania DNA. With the PCR assay, a specific and sensitive diagnostic procedure is finally possible.

==Prevention==
Currently, no [[vaccine]]s are in routine use. However, the genomic sequence of ''Leishmania'' has provided a rich source of vaccine candidates.  [[Genome]]-based approaches have been used to screen for novel vaccine candidates.  One study screened 100 randomly selected [[gene]]s as DNA vaccines against ''L. major'' infection in mice.  Fourteen reproducibly protective, novel vaccine candidates were identified.  A separate study used a two-step procedure to identify T cell antigens.  Six unique clones were identified: glutamine synthetase, a transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, elongation factor 1gamma, kinesin K-39, repetitive protein A2, and a hypothetical conserved protein.  The 20 antigens identified in these two studies are being further evaluated for vaccine development.<ref name=MylerP>{{Cite book| author = Myler P; Fasel N (editors). | title = Leishmania: After The Genome | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year=2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/leish |page={{Page needed|date=September 2010}} | isbn = 978-1-904455-28-8 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Update|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Paromomycin structure.svg|thumb|right|[[Paromomycin]] is said to be an inexpensive (US$10) and effective treatment for leishmaniasis.]]
There are two common therapies containing [[antimony]] (known as [[pentavalent antimonials]]): [[meglumine antimoniate]] (Glucantime) and [[sodium stibogluconate]] (Pentostam). It is not completely understood how these drugs act against the parasite; they may disrupt its energy production or [[trypanothione]] metabolism.  Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, the parasite has become resistant to antimony when treating for visceral or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis,<ref name="Soto2007">{{Cite journal| author=Soto, J., Toledo, J.

[[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase]] (HGPRT; EC 2.4.2.8) is a central enzyme in the purine recycling pathway. Parasitic protozoa (Leishmania donovani) cannot synthesize purines de novo and utilize the salvage pathway to produce purine bases. Thus, this enzyme is targeted in drug discovery and development. The model of the monomeric L. donovani HGPRT showed that this enzyme is an α/β type protein with a PRTase type I folding pattern. Among all of the computationally screened compounds, pentamidine, 1,3-dinitroadamantane, acyclovir and analogs of acyclovir had higher binding affinities than the real substrate (guanosine monophosphate). Amino acids of HGPRT that are frequently involved in the binding of these compounds are Lys 66, Asp 74, Arg 77, Asp 81, Val 88, Tyr 182, Arg 192 and Arg 194. It is predicted that patients suffering from both HIV and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) may benefit if they are treated with acyclovir or pentamidine in conjunction with first-line antileishmanial therapies such as miltefosine and AmBisome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ansari MY, Dikhit MR, Sahoo GC, Das P |title=Comparative modeling of HGPRT enzyme of L. donovani and binding affinities of different analogs of GMP |journal=Int.

[[Miltefosine]] (Impavido), is a new drug for [[visceral]] and [[cutaneous]] leishmaniasis. The cure rate of miltefosine in phase III [[clinical trials]] is 95%; studies in Ethiopia show it is also effective in Africa. In an observational study of 34 Dutch soldiers with ''Leishmania major'' infection who had failed to respond to intralesional antimony, 30 responded to miltefosine.<ref name="vanThiel2010">{{Cite journal| author= van Thiel P.P.A.M.

Clinical trials in Colombia showed a high efficacy for cutaneous leishmaniasis. In mucocutaneous cases caused by ''L. brasiliensis'', it has shown to be more effective than other drugs.

Miltefosine received approval by the Indian regulatory authorities in 2002 and in Germany in 2004. In 2005, it received the first approval for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia. Miltefosine is also currently being investigated as treatment for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis caused by ''[[Leishmania braziliensis]]'' in Colombia,<ref name="Soto2007"/> and preliminary results are very promising.

The drug is generally better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointestinal disturbance in the 1–2 days of treatment, which does not affect the efficacy. Because it is available as an oral formulation, the expense and inconvenience of hospitalisation is avoided, which makes it an attractive alternative.
However, there are problems associated with the use of miltefosine that arise from its teratogenicity and pharmacokinetics: 
In a Dutch study by Thomas P.C. Dorlo in 2008, miltefosine was shown to be much slower eliminated from the body than previously
thought and was therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken five months
after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond five months after treatment might contribute to
the selection of resistant parasites and, moreover, the measures for preventing the
teratogenic risks of miltefosine must be reconsidered. This led to some reluctance to taking Miltefosine by affected populations.

The antifungal drug, [[fluconazole]] 200&nbsp;mg daily, has been shown to be significantly more effective in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis compared to the placebo in a trial done in Saudi Arabia.

[[The Institute for OneWorld Health]] has reintroduced the drug [[paromomycin]] for treatment of leishmaniasis, results with which led to its approval as an [[orphan drug]]. The [[Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative]] is also actively facilitating the search for novel therapeutics.  A treatment with paromomycin will cost about $10. The drug had originally been identified in 1960s, but had been abandoned because it would not be profitable, as the disease mostly affects poor people.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/health/31charity.html A Small Charity Takes the Reins in Fighting a Neglected Disease], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 31, 2006.</ref> The Indian government approved paromomycin for sale in August 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.oneworldhealth.org/drug_program | title = Drug Program – Clinical Trial of Paramomycin | publisher = [[Institute for OneWorld Health]] | accessdate = 10 February 2011}}</ref>  A 21-day course of paromomycin produces a definitive cure in &gt;90% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sundar S, Agrawal N, Arora R, ''et al.''|title=Short‐course paromomycin treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in India: 14‐day vs 21‐day treatment|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2009|volume=49|issue=6|pmid=19673613|pages=850–851|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/605438|doi=10.1086/605432}}</ref>

Leishmaniasis can be transmitted in many tropical and subtropical countries, and is found in parts of about 88 countries.  Approximately 350 million people live in these areas.

It affects as many as 12 million people worldwide, with 1.5–2 million new cases each year.<ref>[http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/magnitude/burden_magnitude/en/index.html Leishmaniasis: Magnitude of the problem].

[[File:JerichoButtons.jpg|thumb|A 1917 case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Middle East, known then locally as "Jericho Buttons" for the frequency of cases near the ancient city of [[Jericho]]]]

Descriptions of conspicuous lesions similar to cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) appear on [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from King [[Ashurbanipal]] from the seventh century BC, some of which may have derived from even earlier texts from 1500 to 2500 BC. [[Islam|Muslim]] physicians, including [[Avicenna]] in the 10th century AD, gave detailed descriptions of what was called ''[[Balkh]]'' sore.<ref>

</ref>  In 1756, Alexander Russell, after examining a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] patient, gave one of the most detailed clinical descriptions of the disease. Physicians in the [[Indian subcontinent]] would describe it as ''kala-azar'' (pronounced ''kālā āzār'', the [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] phrase for "black fever", ''kālā'' meaning black and ''āzār'' meaning fever or disease). In the Americas, evidence of the cutaneous form of the disease in [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] appears in pre-Inca potteries depicting skin lesions and deformed faces dating back to the first century AD. Some 15th and 16th century texts from the [[Inca]] period and from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonials]] mention "valley sickness", "Andean sickness", or "white leprosy", which are likely to be CL.<ref>{{Cite web| title = WHO: Leishmaniasis background information – a brief history of the disease | url = http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/}}

On February 2012, the nonprofit [[Infectious Disease Research Institute]] launched the world’s first human [[clinical trial]] of the [[visceral leishmaniasis]] vaccine.  The vaccine is a recombinant form of two fused Leishmania parasite proteins with an [[adjuvant]].  Two phase 1 clinical trials with healthy volunteers are to be conducted.  The first one takes place in [[Washington (state)]] and is followed by a trial in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/worlds-first-kala-azar-vaccine-enters-clinic/2012-02-23|title=World’s first kala azar vaccine enters the clinic|author=Elvidge, Suzanne|publisher=FierceVaccines.com|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] Kuvin Center for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, in a collaborative effort with [[Addis Ababa University]], was awarded a grant by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] for research into visceral leishmaniasis in [[Ethiopia]]. The project will gather data to be analyzed to identify the weak links in the transmission cycle, and devise methods for control of the disease.<ref>[http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/5-m-for-disease-control-in-ethiopia $5m for disease control in Ethiopia] in [http://www.israel21c.org/ Israel 21c Innovation News Service] Retrieved 2009-12-30</ref>

HIV [[protease inhibitors]] have been found to be active against ''Leishmania'' species in two ''in vitro'' studies in [[Canada]] and India.

==Notable cases==

While filming the latest series of Extreme Dreams in Peru, UK television presenter [[Ben Fogle]] caught the disease. He was left bedridden for three weeks on his return home. Fogle was treated at London's [[Hospital for Tropical Diseases]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7699638.stm Fogle catches a flesh-eating bug]</ref>

During his two and a half year walk through the Amazon [[Ed Stafford]] tested positive for [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] in [[Oriximiná]], [[Para]], [[Brazil]]. He convinced the local doctor that he could not stay in one place for treatment due to his undertaking and was prescribed with 20 days of intravenous injections that he self administered in the jungle.
