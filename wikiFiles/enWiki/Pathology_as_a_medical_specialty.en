'''Pathologists''' are [[physician]]s who diagnose and characterize disease in living patients by examining [[Biopsy|biopsies]] or [[bodily fluid]].  Pathologists may also conduct [[autopsy|autopsies]] to investigate causes of death. Pathology is a core discipline of [[medical school]] and many pathologists are also instructors. As managers of medical laboratories, pathologists play an important role in the development of laboratory [[information systems]]. Although the medical practice of pathology grew out of the tradition of [[General pathology|investigative pathology]], most modern pathologists do not perform original research.

Pathology is a unique medical specialty in that pathologists typically do not see [[patient]]s directly, but rather serve as consultants to other physicians (often referred to as "clinicians" within the pathology community). To be licensed, candidates must complete medical training, an approved residency program and be certified by an appropriate body. In the US, certification is by the [[American Board of Pathology]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Pathology]]. The organization of subspecialties within pathology varies between nations, but usually includes [[anatomical pathology]] and [[clinical pathology]].

==Training==
===Pathology in the United States===
In the United States, pathologists are physicians ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] or [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]) that have completed a four-year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, and three to four years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology [[medical residency|residency]]. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the [[American Board of Pathology]]: [[anatomical Pathology]] and [[clinical Pathology]], each of which requires separate board certification. The [[American Osteopathic Board of Pathology]] also recognizes four primary specialties: anatomic pathology, dermatopathology, forensic pathology, and [[laboratory medicine]]. Many pathologists pursue a broad based training and become certified in both fields. These skills are complementary in many hospital based private practice settings, since the day to day work of many clinical laboratories only intermittently requires the attention of a physician. Thus, pathologists are able to spend much of their time evaluating anatomical pathology cases, while remaining available to cover any special issues which might arise in the clinical laboratories. Pathologists may pursue specialised fellowship training within one or more subspecialties of either anatomical or clinical pathology. Some of these subspecialties permit additional board certification, while others do not.<ref>[http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx Homepage] of the American Board of Pathology</ref>

===Pathology in the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, pathologists are [[medical doctor]]s registered with — and currently licensed by — the UK [[General Medical Council]]. The training to become a pathologist is under the oversight of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]]. After four to six years of undergraduate medical study, trainees proceed to a two year foundation programme. Full-time training in Histopathology presently lasts between five to five and a half years. The first year involves structured training and is assessed by an objective structured practical exam (OSPE), which must be passed to progress to year two. This is followed by further specialist training in surgical pathology, cytopathology, and autopsy pathology. There are two examinations run by the [[Royal College of Pathologists]], termed Part 1 and Part 2. The Part 2 examination is designed to test competence to work as an independent practitioner in pathology and is typically taken after four or five years of specialist training. All postgraduate medical training and education in the UK is overseen by the General Medical Council (GMC). It is possible to take a specialist part 2 examination in [[forensic pathology]], [[pediatric pathology]], or [[neuropathology]]. It is also possible to take a [[Royal College of Pathologists]] diploma in [[forensic pathology]], [[dermatopathology]], or [[cytopathology]], recognising additional specialist training and expertise.

=== Pathology in France ===
In France, Pathology is separate in two distinct specialties, [[Anatomical pathology]] and [[Clinical pathology]]. Residencies both lasts four years. Residency in [[anatomical pathology]] is open to physicians only, while [[clinical pathology]] is open to both [[physician]]s and [[pharmacist]]s. Anatomical pathology in France is integrated in the [[internal medicine]] specialty track. At the end of the second year of clinical pathology residency, residents can choose between general [[Clinical pathology]] and a specialization in one of the disciplines, but they can not practise [[Anatomical pathology]]. And conversely, [[Anatomical pathology]] residents can not practise [[Clinical pathology]].<ref>[http://www.sante.gouv.fr/adm/dagpb/bo/2003/03-05/a0050272.htm ''Reglementation'' for French Residency in Clinical Pathology (Biologie médicale)]</ref><ref>[http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/32/MENS0301444A.htm curriculum content of French resident training in clinical pathology, First Level] and [http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2006/19/MENS0601080A.htm Second Level]</ref>
