'''Cockayne syndrome''' (also called '''[[Frederick Parkes Weber|Weber]]-Cockayne syndrome''', or '''Neill-Dingwall syndrome''') is a rare [[autosomal]] [[recessive]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16865293 |year=2006 |month= |author=Bertola, Dr; Cao, H; Albano, Lm; Oliveira, Dp; Kok, F; Marques-Dias, Mj; Kim, Ca; Hegele, Ra |title=Cockayne syndrome type A: novel mutations in eight typical patients |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=701–5 |doi=10.1007/s10038-006-0011-7 |journal=Journal of human genetics}}</ref> [[congenital disorder]] characterized by growth failure, impaired development of the [[nervous system]], abnormal sensitivity to [[sunlight]] ([[photosensitivity]]), and premature [[aging]].<ref>{{cite book |author=James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders |location= |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |page=575 |edition=10th}}</ref> [[Hearing loss]] and [[human eye|eye]] abnormalities ([[pigmentary retinopathy]]) are other common features, but problems with any or all of the internal organs are possible.  It is associated with a group of disorders called [[leukodystrophies]].

It is named after English physician [[Edward Alfred Cockayne]] (1880–1956) and English dermatologist Frederick Parkes Weber (1863–1962). Neill-Dingwall syndrome was named after [[Mary M. Dingwall]] and [[Catherine A. Neill]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1182|Cockayne's syndrome}}</ref>

== Forms of Cockayne syndrome (CS) ==
* CS Type I, the classic form, is characterized by normal fetal growth with the onset of abnormalities in the first two years of life. Impairment of vision, hearing, and the central and peripheral nervous systems progressively degenerate until death in the first or second decade of life.
* CS Type II, otherwise known as connatal CS, involves very little neurological development after birth. Death usually occurs by age seven. This specific type has also been designated as '''cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal''' (COFS) '''syndrome'''.<ref>http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&data_id=1649&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal-syndrome&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=Pat&Disease(s) concerned=COFS-syndrome--Cerebrooculofacioskeletal-syndrome-&title=COFS-syndrome--Cerebrooculofacioskeletal-syndrome-&search=Disease_Search_Simple</ref><ref>{{OMIM|214150|Cerebrooculofacioskeletal Syndrome 1; COFS1}}</ref> COFS syndrome can be further subdivided into several conditions (COFS types 1, 2, 3 (associated with [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]) and 4).<ref>{{OMIM|610756|Cerebrooculofacioskeletal Syndrome 2; COFS2}}<br/>{{OMIM|278780|Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Complementation Group G; XPG}}<br/>{{OMIM|610758|Cerebrooculofacioskeletal Syndrome 4; COFS4}}</ref>
* CS Type III, characterized by late onset, is rare and milder than Types I and II.
* Xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS) occurs when an individual also suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum, another DNA repair disease. Some symptoms of each disease are expressed.

==Genetics==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Cockayne syndrome has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of [[inheritance]].]]
Cockayne syndrome is classified [[gene]]tically as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type
! [[OMIM]]
! Gene
|-
| A
| {{OMIM2|216400}}
| [[ERCC8]]
|-
| B
| {{OMIM2|133540}}
| [[ERCC6]]
|-
| C
| {{OMIM2|216411}}
| none known
|}

Mutations in the [[ERCC6]] and [[ERCC8]] genes are the cause of Cockayne syndrome. The [[protein]]s made by these genes are involved in [[DNA repair|repairing damaged]] [[DNA]] via the [[transcription-coupled repair]] mechanism, particularly the DNA in active genes. If either the ERCC6 or the ERCC8 gene is altered, DNA damage is not repaired. As this damage accumulates, it can lead to malfunctioning cells or [[cell death]].

Mutations in the ERCC6 gene mutation makes up ~70% of cases.

==Physical appearance==
Persons with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, and they have an "aged" look.
