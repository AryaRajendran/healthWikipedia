'''Mast cell leukemia''' is an extremely aggressive subtype of [[acute myeloid leukemia]] that usually occurs de novo but can, rarely, evolve from transformation of [[chronic myeloid leukemia]] into the more aggressive [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. In a small proportion of cases, acute mast cell leukemia may evolve from a more progressive form of [[systemic mastocytosis]]. The diagnosis of acute mast cell leukemia by the [[WHO]] criteria includes the requirement for a prevalence of 20% neoplastic [[mast cells]] in marrow and 10% in blood.<ref name=Lichtman05>{{cite journal |author=Lichtman MA, Segel GB |title=Uncommon phenotypes of acute myelogenous leukemia: basophilic, mast cell, eosinophilic, and myeloid dendritic cell subtypes: a review |journal=Blood Cells Mol. Dis. |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=370–83 |year=2005 |pmid=16203163 |doi=10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.08.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1079-9796(05)00148-8}}</ref> If the mast cells represent less than 10% of blood cells, the tumor is called "aleukemic" mast cell leukemia.

==Laboratory Findings==
===Cytochemistry===
Cytochemical properties of the leukemic cells must be typical of mast cell derivation (presence of [[metachromatic]] granules staining with alpha-naphthyl chloroacetate esterase, but not with peroxidase).<ref name="Kufe D 2000">{{cite book |author=Kufe D, ''et al.'' |title=Holland Frei Cancer Medicine |publisher=BC Decker |year=2000 |edition=5th}}</ref> Mast cell [[tryptase]] is an enzyme contained in mast cell granules. Mast cell numbers are best estimated by tryptase immunostaining because very poorly granulated cells may stain very weakly if at all for alpha-naphthol chloroacetate esterase.<ref name=Lichtman05/>

===Tumor Markers===
The leukemic cells usually are strongly positive for [[CD13]], [[CD33]], [[CD68]], and [[CD117]]. Characteristically, basophil (e.g. [[CD11b]], [[CD123]]) and monocyte markers ([[CD14]], [[CD15]]) are absent. The cells usually express [[CD2]] and [[CD25]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Valent P |title=1995 Mack-Forster Award Lecture. Review.

===Biochemistry===
Total serum tryptase is elevated in mast cell leukemia. Normal total(alpha + beta) serum tryptase is approximately 6 micro g/L (range 0 to 11 micro g/L). Values of several hundred micro g/L are characteristic of mast cell leukemia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sperr WR, Jordan JH, Fiegl M, ''et al.'' |title=Serum tryptase levels in patients with mastocytosis: correlation with mast cell burden and implication for defining the category of disease |journal=Int.

==Clinical course==
Acute mast cell leukemia is a rapidly progressive disorder with leukemic mast cells in blood and in large numbers in marrow.

is suspected.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hoffbrand AV, Catovsky D, Tuddenham E |title=Postgraduate Haematology |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |edition=5th}}</ref>

==Therapy==
Immunoglobulin E ([[IgE]]) is important in mast cell function. Immunotherapy with anti-IgE immunoglobulin raised in sheep resulted in a transient decrease in the numbers of circulating mast cells in one patient with mast cell leukemia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ribeiro I, Carvalho IR, Fontes M, ''et al.'' |title=Eosinophilic leukaemia with trisomy 8 and double gammopathy |journal=J.

Chemotherapy with combination of [[cytosine arabinoside]] and either [[idarubicin]], [[daunomycin]], or [[mitoxantrone]] as for acute myeloid leukemia should be considered. Stem cell transplantation is an option, although no experience exists concerning responses and outcome.<ref name=Ansell08/>

==Prognosis==
Acute mast cell leukemia is extremely aggressive and has a grave prognosis. In most cases, multiorgan failure including bone marrow failure develops over weeks to months.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hoffman R, Benz E, Shattil S, Furie B, Cohen H |title=Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |year=2004 |edition=4th}}</ref> Medial survival after diagnosis is only about 6 months.<ref name=Travis86/>
