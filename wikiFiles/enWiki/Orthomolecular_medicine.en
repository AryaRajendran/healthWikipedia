==Medical and scientific reception==
===Methodology===
Orthomolecular therapies have been criticized as lacking a sufficient evidence base for clinical use: their scientific foundations are too weak, the studies that have been performed are too few and too open to interpretation, and reported positive findings in observational studies are contradicted by the results of more rigorous clinical trials.<ref name="cassileth"/><ref>

Proponents of orthomolecular medicine strongly dispute this statement by citing studies demonstrating the effectiveness of treatments involving vitamins, though this ignores the belief that a normal diet will provide adequate nutrients to avoid deficiencies, and that orthomolecular treatments are not actually related to [[Avitaminosis|vitamin deficiency]].<ref name=Singh2008/> The lack of scientifically rigorous testing of orthomolecular medicine has led to its practices being classed with other forms of alternative medicine and regarded as unscientific.<ref>

A 1973 task force of the American Psychiatric Association unanimously concluded:
<blockquote>This review and critique has carefully examined the literature produced by megavitamin proponents and by those who have attempted to replicate their basic and clinical work. It concludes in this regard that the credibility of the megavitamin proponents is low. Their credibility is further diminished by a consistent refusal over the past decade to perform controlled experiments and to report their new results in a scientifically acceptable fashion. Under these circumstances this Task Force considers the massive publicity which they promulgate via radio, the lay press and popular books, using catch phrases which are really misnomers like "megavitamin therapy" and "orthomolecular treatment," to be deplorable.<ref>

====Deaths resulting from illegal vitamin trials in South Africa====

[[Matthias Rath]] has been extensively criticized for presenting his vitamin supplements as a treatment for AIDS and for testing them in illegal trials in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kapp C |title=South Africans hope for a new era in HIV/AIDS policies |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9549 |pages=1759–60 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17120343 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69717-1}}</ref><ref name=Smith/> A former associate of Linus Pauling, Rath has promoted vitamins as a treatment for HIV infection, describing treatment with effective [[antiretroviral drugs]] as toxic and part of a global conspiracy serving the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry.<ref name=Rath>

===Alleged institutional bias===
Advocates of orthomolecular medicine, including Pauling, Hoffer and [[Ewan Cameron (physician)|Ewan Cameron]] have claimed that their findings are actively suppressed by the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Hoffer wrote "There is no conspiracy led and directed by a single person or by a single organization. There is no Mafia in psychiatry. However, there is a conspiracy led and directed by a large number of professionals and their associations who have a common aim to protect their hard-earned orthodoxy, no matter what the cost to their opponent colleagues or to their patients.".<ref>

The ''[[Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine]]'', founded in 1967 as the ''Journal of Schizophrenia'', is a major publication of orthomolecular medicine. As [[Abram Hoffer]] wrote:
:We had to create our own journals because it was impossible to obtain entry into the official journals of [[psychiatry]] and medicine. Before 1967 I had not found it difficult to publish reports in these journals, and by then I had about 150 articles and several books in the establishment press.<ref name="hoffer">
