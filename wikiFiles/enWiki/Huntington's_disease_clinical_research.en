[[Huntington's disease]] is a [[genetics|genetic]] [[Neurodegenerative disease|neurological disorder]] characterized after onset by uncoordinated, jerky body movements and a decline in some mental abilities for which there is no present cure or effective treatments.

Research into the mechanism of [[Huntington's disease]] (HD) has focused on identifying the functioning of the [[huntingtin]] protein (Htt), how mutant huntingtin (mHtt) differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that the disease produces. Research is conducted using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods, animal models and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms causing the disease and for supporting the early stages of [[drug development]].<ref name=ross-tabrizi /> The identification of the causative gene has enabled the development of many [[transgenic animal]] models including [[nematode]] worms, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys that express mutant huntingtin and develop progressive [[neurodegeneration]] and HD-like symptoms.<ref name=ross-tabrizi>{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=CA|coauthors=Tabrizi, SJ|title=Huntington's disease: from molecular pathogenesis to clinical treatment|journal=Lancet neurology|date=2011 Jan|volume=10|issue=1|pages=83–98|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70245-3|pmid=21163446}}</ref> 

Three broad approaches are under study to attempt to slow the progression of Huntington's disease: reducing production of the mutant protein, improving cells' ability to survive its diverse harmful effects, and replacing lost neurons.<ref name=munoz-bates-jci>{{cite journal|last=Munoz-Sanjuan|first=Ignacio|coauthors=Bates, Gillian P.|title=The importance of integrating basic and clinical research toward the development of new therapies for Huntington disease|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|year=2011|volume=121|issue=2|pages=476–483|doi=10.1172/JCI45364|pmid=21285520|pmc=3026740}}</ref>

==Reducing huntingtin production==
[[File:RNAi-simplified.png|thumb |alt=Simplified diagram of RNA interference|[[RNA interference]] is one form of gene silencing that is under investigation as a possible treatment for HD.]]

[[Gene silencing]] aims to reduce the production of the mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHtt is reduced, symptoms improve.<ref name=munoz-bates-jci /> Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McBride|first=Jodi L|coauthors=Pitzer, Mark R, Boudreau, Ryan L, Dufour, Brett, Hobbs, Theodore, Ojeda, Sergio R, Davidson, Beverly L|title=Preclinical Safety of RNAi-Mediated HTT Suppression in the Rhesus Macaque as a Potential Therapy for Huntington's Disease|journal=Molecular Therapy|date=25 October 2011|volume=19|issue=12|pages=2152–2162|doi=10.1038/mt.2011.219|pmid=22031240|pmc=3242667}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kordasiewicz|first=Holly B.|coauthors=Lisa M.

Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant Htt while leaving wild-type Htt untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele.<ref name=sah-aronin>{{cite journal|last=Barnes|first=DW|coauthors=Whitley, RJ|title=Antiviral therapy and pulmonary disease.|journal=Chest|date=1987 Feb|volume=91|issue=2|pages=246–51|doi=10.1172/JCI45130|pmc=3026739|pmid=21285523}}</ref>

==Improving cell survival==
Among the approaches aimed at improving cell survival in the presence of mutant huntingtin are correction of [[transcriptional regulation]] using [[histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s, modulating [[Protein aggregation|aggregation]] of huntingtin, improving [[metabolism]] and [[Mitochondria|mitochondrial function]] and restoring dysfunction of [[synapses]].<ref name=munoz-bates-jci />

==Neuronal replacement==
[[Stem cell treatments|Stem cell therapy]] is the replacement of damaged neurons by transplantation of [[stem cell]]s into affected regions of the brain. Experiments have yielded mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human [[clinical trial]]s.<ref name="pmid18341412">{{cite journal |author=Clelland CD, Barker RA, Watts C |title=Cell therapy in Huntington disease |journal=Neurosurg Focus |volume=24 |issue=3–4 |page=E9 |year=2008 |pmid=18341412 |doi=10.3171/FOC/2008/24/3-4/E8 }}</ref> Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a valuable tool for studying HD in the laboratory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cundiff|first=Paige E|coauthors=Anderson, Stewart A|title=Impact of induced pluripotent stem cells on the study of central nervous system disease|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics & Development|date=31 May 2011|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–361|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.008|pmid=21277194}}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
Numerous drugs have been reported to produce benefits in animals, such as [[creatine]], and [[coenzyme Q10]]. Some of these have then been tested by humans in clinical trials, with more underway, but as yet none has proven effective.<ref name="lancet225">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |year=2007 |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 |pages=218–28 [225] }}</ref> Large observational studies involving human volunteers have revealed insights into the pathobiology of HD and supplied outcome measures for future clinical trials.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tabrizi|first=Sarah J|coauthors=Reilmann, Ralf, Roos, Raymund AC, Durr, Alexandra, Leavitt, Blair, Owen, Gail, Jones, Rebecca, Johnson, Hans, Craufurd, David, Hicks, Stephen L, Kennard, Christopher, Landwehrmeyer, Bernhard, Stout, Julie C, Borowsky, Beth, Scahill, Rachael I, Frost, Chris, Langbehn, Douglas R|title=Potential endpoints for clinical trials in premanifest and early Huntington's disease in the TRACK-HD study: analysis of 24 month observational data|journal=The Lancet Neurology|date=1 December 2011|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70263-0|volume=11|pages=42–53|pmid=22137354|issue=1}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:GPU - F@H.jpg|thumb|right| [[folding@home]] client running on a user's computer]]
There have been different candidate therapies investigated for Huntington's disease which have not borne out. These are noted below for historic context. 
<!--feel free to trim the below should it repeat content above, or to recast it into past tense otherwise-->

=== Intrabody therapy (history) ===
[[Genetic engineering|Genetically-engineered]] [[intracellular]] [[antibody]] fragments called [[intrabody (protein)|intrabodies]] have shown therapeutic results in [[Drosophila|fruit fly]] models, by inhibiting mHtt aggregation using an intrabody which binds to the end of mHtt [[Intracellular|within a cell]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lecerf JM, Shirley TL, Zhu Q, ''et al.'' |title=Human single-chain Fv intrabodies counteract in situ huntingtin aggregation in cellular models of Huntington's disease |journal=Proc.

=== Pharmacological (history) ===

Several randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of possible treatments have been tested in humans, and more are underway.

Compounds that have failed to prevent or slow HD in human trials include [[remacemide]], [[coenzyme Q10]], [[riluzole]], [[creatine]], [[minocycline]], [[ethyl-EPA]], [[phenylbutyrate]] and [[dimebon]].<ref name=hsgcompletedtrials>{{cite web|title=Completed Clinical Trials|url=http://www.huntington-study-group.org/ClinicalResearch/CompletedClinicalTrials/tabid/65/Default.aspx|publisher=Huntington Study Group|accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>

=== Bioinformatic approaches (history) ===

One (non-clinical) avenue of  research was understanding the physical mechanics of protein folding using distributed computing. HD has been one of several targets of the [[folding@home]] project.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-Diseases#ntoc7| title = Folding@home Diseases Studied FAQ | accessdate = 2012-01-27| author = Vijay Pande| year = 2011| publisher = Stanford University}}</ref> In 2009 this led to publication of a predicted structure for the Huntingtin [[protein headpiece]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19361448 | doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.032 | volume=388 | issue=5 | title=The predicted structure of the headpiece of the Huntingtin protein and its implications on Huntingtin aggregation | pmc=2677131 | year=2009 | month=May | author=Kelley NW, Huang X, Tam S, Spiess C, Frydman J, Pande VS | journal=J.
