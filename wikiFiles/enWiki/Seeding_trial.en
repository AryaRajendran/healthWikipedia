A '''seeding trial''' or '''marketing trial''' is a form of marketing, conducted in the name of research, designed to target product sampling towards selected consumers. In medicine, seeding trials are [[clinical trial]]s or research studies in which the primary objective is to introduce the concept of a particular medical intervention&mdash;such as a pharmaceutical drug or medical device&mdash;to physicians, rather than to test a scientific hypothesis.<ref name=STEPS>{{cite journal |author=Krumholz SD, Egilman DS, Ross JS |title=Study of Neurontin: Titrate to Effect, Profile of Safety (STEPS) Trial: A Narrative Account of a Gabapentin Seeding Trial |journal=Arch.

To create loyalty and advocacy towards a brand, seeding trials take advantage of [[opinion leadership]] to enhance sales, capitalizing on the [[Hawthorne Effect]].<ref name=viral>{{cite book |author=Paul Marsden; Justin Kirby |title=Connected marketing: the viral, buzz and word of mouth revolution |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |location=Oxford |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7506-6634-X |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www.viralculture.com/pubs/seedtospread.htm |accessdate=}}</ref> In a seeding trial, the brand provides potential opinion leaders with the product for free, aiming to gain valuable pre-market feedback and also to build support among the testers, creating influential word-of-mouth advocates for the product. By involving the opinion leaders as testers, effectively inviting them to be an extension of the marketing department, companies can create "a powerful sense of ownership among the clients, customers or consumers that count" by offering engaging the testers in a research dialogue.<ref name=viral/> Seeding trials in medicine are not illegal but are considered unethical because they "deceive investigators, clinicians, and patients, subverting the scientific process".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alexander GC |title=Seeding Trials and the Subordination of Science: Comment on "Study of Neurontin: Titrate to Effect, Profile of Safety (STEPS) Trial" |journal=Arch.

==In industry==
An early example of a seeding trial was during the development of [[Post-it notes]], produced by [[3M]]. In 1977, secretaries to senior management staff throughout the United States were sent packs of Post-its and invited to suggest possible uses for them. They soon found them to be extremely useful and became "brand champions" for the product, an early example of [[viral marketing]].<ref name="post-it">[[Snopes.com]]:{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/business/origins/post-it.asp |title=Post-It Note Origin |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

Companies that have used seeding trials include [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hasbro]], [[Google]], [[Unilever]], [[Pepsi]], [[Coca-Cola Company|Coke]], [[Ford]], [[Dreamworks SKG]], [[EMI]], [[Sony]], and [[Siemens]].<ref name=viral/>

==In medicine==
Seeding trials to promote a medical intervention were described as "trials of approved drugs appear to serve little or no scientific purpose" and "thinly veiled attempts to entice doctors to prescribe a new drug being marketed by the company" in a special article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''. The article, whose authors included [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] commissioner [[David Aaron Kessler]], also described a number of characteristics common to seeding trials:<ref name=NEJM>{{cite journal |author=Kessler DA, Rose JL, Temple RJ, Schapiro R, Griffin JP |title=Therapeutic-class wars--drug promotion in a competitive marketplace |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=331 |issue=20 |pages=1350–3 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7935706 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199411173312007|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/20/1350 |accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>
* The trial is of an intervention with many competitors
* Use of a trial design unlikely to achieve its stated scientific aims (e.g., un-[[Blind experiment|blinded]], no [[control group]], no [[placebo]])
* Recruitment of physicians as trial investigators because they commonly prescribe similar medical interventions rather than for their scientific merit
* Disproportionately high payments to trial investigators for relatively little work
* Sponsorship is from a company's sales or marketing budget rather than from research and development
* Little requirement for valid data collection

In a seeding trial, doctors and their patients are given free access to a drug and exclusive information and services to use the drug effectively. Additionally, participating physicians are often given financial remuneration and a chance to be a co-author on a resulting scientific publication. By triggering the [[Hawthorne effect]], physicians become "opinion-leading word-of-mouth advocates".<ref name=viral/> This practice has been shown to be effective.<ref name="pmid16788131">{{cite journal |author=Andersen M, Kragstrup J, Søndergaard J |title=How conducting a clinical trial affects physicians' guideline adherence and drug preferences |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=23 |pages=2759–64 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16788131 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.23.2759 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16788131}}</ref>
