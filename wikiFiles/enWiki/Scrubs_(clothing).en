'''Scrubs''' are the shirts and trousers or gowns worn by [[nurse]]s ([[perioperative nurse]]), [[surgery|surgeon]]s, and other [[operating room]] personnel when "scrubbing in" for [[surgery]]. In the United Kingdom, they are sometimes known as Theatre Blues.  They are designed to be simple with minimal places for dirt to hide, easy to launder, and cheap to replace if damaged or stained irreparably.  The wearing of scrubs has been extended outside of surgery in many [[hospital]]s.  Originally issued as replacement clothing if street clothing was contaminated, scrubs are now  worn by any hospital personnel in any clean environment. The spread of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) has increased the use of scrubs but can give wearers a false sense of security that they are 'clean' when in fact are as easily contaminated as any other clothing.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal |last=Neely |first=A.

The television show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' is partly named for this garment.

==History of surgical attire==
In contrast to the uniforms long required of [[nurse]]s, [[surgeon]]s did not wear any kind of specialized garments until well into the 20th century.  [[surgery|Surgical]] procedures were conducted in an [[operating theater]]. The surgeon wore his own clothes, with perhaps a butcher's apron to protect his clothing from blood stains,<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherlock|first=Angela|title=The Origin of Scrubs|url=http://www.medelita.com/blog/the-origin-of-scrubs/|publisher=Medelita Lab Coats & Scrubs|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> and he operated bare-handed with non-[[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] instruments and supplies.  (Gut and silk [[surgical suture|suture]]s were sold as open strands with reusable, hand-threaded needles; packing gauze was made of sweepings from the floors of cotton mills.)  In contrast to today's concept of surgery as a profession that emphasizes cleanliness and conscientiousness, up to the early 20th century the mark of a busy and successful surgeon was the profusion of blood and fluids on his clothes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Udin|first=Zaf|title=Nursing Uniforms of the Past and Present|url=http://www.pulseuniform.com/nursing/nursing-uniforms.asp|publisher=Pulse Uniform|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> The importance of dress as a badge of one's class in society was paramount and the processes behind the transmission of infection were the subject of controversy within the profession.

With the "[[Spanish flu]]" [[pandemic]] of 1918 and the growing medical interest in [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]]'s [[antisepsis|antiseptic]] theory, some surgeons began wearing cotton gauze masks in surgery; however, this was not to protect the patient from intra-operative [[infection]], but to protect the surgeon from the patient's diseases.  Around the same time, operating theatre staff began wearing heavy rubber gloves to protect their hands from the solutions used to clean the room and equipment, a practice surgeons grudgingly adopted.

By the 1940s, advances in surgical antisepsis (now called aseptic technique) and the science of wound infection led to the adoption of antiseptic drapes and gowns for [[operating room]] use.  Instruments, supplies and dressings were routinely sterilized by exposure to either [[autoclave|high-pressure steam]] or [[ethylene oxide]].

Originally, operating room attire was white to emphasize cleanliness.  However, the combination of bright operating lights and an all-white environment led to eye strain for the surgeon and staff.  By the 1950s and 1960s, most hospitals had abandoned white operating room apparel in favor of various shades of green, which provided a high-contrast environment, reduced eye fatigue, and made bright red blood splashes less conspicuous {{Clarify|date=August 2011}}.

By the 1970s, surgical attire had largely reached its modern state:  a short-sleeve V-necked shirt and drawstring pants or a short-sleeve calf-length dress, made of green cotton or cotton/polyester blend.  Over this was worn a tie-back or bouffant-style cloth cap, a gauze or synthetic textile mask, a cloth or synthetic surgical gown, latex gloves, and supportive closed-toe shoes.  This uniform was originally known as "surgical greens" because of its color, but came to be called "scrubs" because it was worn in a "scrubbed" environment.

==Modern scrubs==

Today, any medical [[uniform]] consisting of a short-sleeve shirt and pants is known as "scrubs".  Scrubs may also include a waist-length long-sleeved jacket with no [[Jacket lapel|lapels]] and stockinette cuffs, known as a "warm-up jacket".  Nearly all patient care personnel at hospitals in the United States wear some form of scrubs while on duty, as do some staffers in doctor, dental, and veterinary offices. Doctors in the United States may wear their own clothes with a [[white coat]] except for surgery. Support staff such as custodians and unit clerks also wear scrubs in some facilities.

===Colors and patterns===

Scrubs worn in surgery are almost always colored solid light green, light blue or a light green-blue shade, although some medical centers have switched to pink as a theft deterrent. Surgical scrubs are not owned by the wearer; due to concerns about home laundering and sterility issues, these scrubs are hospital-owned or hospital-leased through a commercial linen service.

Non-surgical scrubs come in a wider variety of colors and patterns, ranging from official issue garments to custom made, whether by commercial uniform companies or by home-sewing using commercially available printed [[pattern (sewing)|patterns]].

Some hospitals use scrub color to differentiate between patient care departments (i.e. Surgery, [[Labor and Delivery]], Emergency, etc.) or between licensed patient care personnel (nurses, radiological technicians, respiratory and physical therapists, etc.), unlicensed assistive personnel, and non-patient care support staff (i.e. portering, dietary, unit clerks, etc.).  Hospitals may also extend the practice to differentiate non-staff members/visitors.

Scrubs featuring cartoon characters and cheerful prints are common in [[pediatrician]]s' offices and children's hospitals, while prints for various holidays can be seen throughout the year. Some acute care facilities or larger hospitals also have relaxed rules regarding the wear of non-regulation scrubs in non-surgical units.

Some scrubs are found in custom colors, e.g. a university hospital may have scrubs in the school's colors.

===External wear===
Scrubs are not as common in hospitals outside of the United States. In most of Europe,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} for example, nurses and midwives mostly wear a uniform of tunic and trousers or a dress.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Doctors tend to wear their own clothes except for surgery, when they wear scrubs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In the UK, all NHS hospital trusts have stringent clothing policies, and many of these specifically forbid the wearing of the iconic white coat for medical staff, owing to infection control concerns.  This has meant that several hospitals around the UK have opted for scrubs for staff, especially in Accident and Emergency departments.

As an item of casual dress, scrubs have gained acceptance outside of hospitals, for example, as pajamas, workout clothing, or loungewear. They are sometimes used by backpackers in an effort to reduce weight load.  Large stencils with the hospital's name or logo imprinted on them (commonly on pockets or at knees) are designed to prevent theft due to their increased popularity as casual wear.

==Scrub caps==
Scrub caps have graduated from being functional to also being a personalized accessory both in the operating room and outside. Before the antiseptic focus of the 1940s, hats were not considered essential to surgery. From the 1940s through the 1950s, as a hygienic focus swept the industry, hats became standard wear to help protect patients from contaminants in hair. Full-face hats were even designed for men with beards. These hats have been and continue to be distributed by [[group purchasing organization]]s (GPOs) who supply hospitals with most equipment.

In the medical fashion 'revolution' of the seventies, more and more medical professionals began personalizing their scrubs by either sewing their own hats or buying premade hats made of eclectic [[textile|fabric]]. Several styles were popular, including the 'bouffant', a utilitarian hairnet-like hat, and the 'milkmaid', a bonnet-like wrap around hat.
