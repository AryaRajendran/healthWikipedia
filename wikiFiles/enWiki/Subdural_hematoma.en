A '''subdural hematoma''' (American spelling) or '''subdural haematoma''' (British spelling), also known as a '''subdural haemorrhage''' (SDH), is a type of [[hematoma]], usually associated with [[traumatic brain injury]].  [[Blood]] gathers within the outermost [[meninges|meningeal]] layer, between the [[dura mater]], which adheres to the skull, and the [[arachnoid mater]], which envelops the brain. Usually resulting from tears in [[bridging veins]] which cross the [[subdural space]], subdural hemorrhages may cause an increase in [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP), which can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue.  Subdural hematomas are often life-threatening when acute. Chronic subdural hematomas, however, have better [[prognosis]] if properly managed.

In contrast, [[epidural hematoma]]s are usually caused by tears in [[artery|arteries]], resulting in a build-up of blood between the dura mater and skull.

==Classification==
Subdural hematomas are divided into [[Acute (medicine)|acute]], subacute, and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], depending on the speed of their onset.<ref>Herbert H Engelhard III, MD, PhD, FACS, Grant P Sinson, MD, George Timothy Reiter, MD, Paul L Penar, MD, FACS, Francisco Talavera, PharmD, PhD, Allen R Wyler, MD, Paolo Zamboni, MD, [[Allen Wyler|Allen R Wyler]] 2009.

Acute bleeds often develop after high speed acceleration or deceleration injuries and are increasingly severe with larger hematomas. They are most severe if associated with [[cerebral contusion]]s.<ref name="wagner"/> Though much faster than chronic subdural bleeds, acute subdural bleeding is usually venous and therefore slower than the usually arterial bleeding of an [[epidural hemorrhage]]. Acute subdural bleeds have a high mortality rate, higher even than epidural hematomas and [[diffuse brain injury|diffuse brain injuries]], because the force (acceleration/deceleration) required to cause them causes other severe injuries as well.<ref>Vinas F.C. and Pilitsis J. 2006.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Epidural vs. subdural hematoma}}

<br/>
Symptoms of subdural hemorrhage have a slower onset than those of [[epidural hemorrhage]]s because the lower pressure veins bleed more slowly than arteries.  Therefore, signs and symptoms may show up in minutes, if not immediately<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000713.htm |title=Subdural hematoma : MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |work=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> but can be delayed as much as 2 weeks.<ref name="Sanders and McKenna">Sanders MJ and McKenna K. 2001. ''Mosby’s Paramedic Textbook'', 2nd revised Ed.  Chapter 22, "Head and facial trauma."

==Causes==
Subdural hematomas are most often caused by [[head injury]], when rapidly changing velocities within the [[Human skull|skull]] may stretch and tear small [[bridging veins]]. Subdural hematomas due to head injury are described as [[Physical trauma|traumatic]]. Much more common than [[epidural hemorrhage]]s, subdural hemorrhages generally result from [[shearing injury|shearing injuries]] due to various rotational or linear forces.<ref name="wagner">Wagner AL. 2004. [http://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic664.htm "Subdural hematoma."] Emedicine.com. Retrieved on August 8, 2007.</ref><ref name="UVT">University of Vermont College of Medicine. [http://web.archive.org/web/20030821142023/http://cats.med.uvm.edu/cats_teachingmod/pathology/path302/np/home/neuroindex.html "Neuropathology: Trauma to the CNS."] Accessed through web archive on August 8, 2007.</ref> Subdural hemorrhage is a classic finding in [[shaken baby syndrome]], in which similar shearing forces classically cause intra- and pre-retinal hemorrhages.   Subdural hematoma is also commonly seen in the elderly and in alcoholics, who have evidence of [[cerebral atrophy]]. Cerebral atrophy increases the length the bridging veins have to traverse between the two meningeal layers, hence increasing the likelihood of shearing forces causing a tear. It is also more common in patients on [[anticoagulant]]s, especially [[aspirin]] and [[warfarin]]. Patients on these medications can have a subdural hematoma with a minor injury.
A further cause can be a reduction in cerebal spinal fluid pressure which can create a low pressure in the subarachnoid space, pulling the arachnoid away from the dura mater and leading to a rupture of the blood vessels.

===Risk factors===
Factors increasing the risk of a subdural hematoma include very young or very old [[senescence|age]].  As the brain shrinks with age, the [[subdural space]] enlarges and the [[vein]]s that traverse the space must travel over a wider distance, making them more vulnerable to tears. This and the fact that the elderly have more brittle veins make chronic subdural bleeds more common in older patients.<ref name="Downie"/> Infants, too, have larger subdural spaces and are more predisposed to subdural bleeds than are young adults.<ref name="wagner"/>  For this reason, subdural hematoma is a common finding in [[shaken baby syndrome]]. In juveniles, an [[arachnoid cyst]] is a risk factor for a subdural hematoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mori K, Yamamoto T, Horinaka N, Maeda M |title=Arachnoid cyst is a risk factor for chronic subdural hematoma in juveniles: twelve cases of chronic subdural hematoma associated with arachnoid cyst |journal=J. Neurotrauma |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=1017–27 |year=2002 |pmid=12482115 |doi=10.1089/089771502760341938}}</ref>

Other risk factors for subdural bleeds include taking blood thinners ([[anticoagulant]]s), long-term [[alcoholism|alcohol abuse]], and [[dementia]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Subdural hematoma - very low mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a chronic subdural hematoma, as demonstrated by thin strands of collagen and neovascularization. [[HPS stain]].]]
Collected blood from the subdural bleed may draw in water due to [[osmosis]], causing it to expand, which may compress brain tissue and cause new bleeds by tearing other blood vessels.<ref name="Downie"/> The collected blood may even develop its own membrane.<ref>McCaffrey P. 2001.  [http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaff/syllabi/SPPA336/336unit11.html "The neuroscience on the web series: CMSD 336 neuropathologies of language and cognition."] California State University, Chico. Retrieved on August 7, 2007.</ref>

In some subdural bleeds, the [[arachnoid layer]] of the [[meninges]] is torn, and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) and blood both expand in the [[intracranial space]], increasing pressure.<ref name="UVT"/>

Substances that cause vasoconstriction may be released from the collected material in a subdural hematoma, causing further [[ischemia]] under the site by restricting blood flow to the brain.<ref name="graham"/>  When the brain is denied adequate blood flow, a [[biochemical cascade]] known as the [[ischemic cascade]] is unleashed, and may ultimately lead to brain [[cell (biology)|cell]] death.

The body gradually reabsorbs the clot and replaces it with [[wound healing phases|granulation tissue]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:SDH.jpg|thumb|A subdural hematoma demonstrated by CT.]]
Subdural hematomas occur most often around the tops and sides of the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[parietal lobe]]s.<ref name="wagner"/><ref name="UVT"/> They also occur in the [[posterior cranial fossa]], and near the [[falx cerebri]] and [[tentorium cerebelli]].<ref name="wagner"/>  Unlike [[epidural hematoma]]s, which cannot expand past the [[skull suture|sutures of the skull]], subdural hematomas can expand along the inside of the skull, creating a concave shape that follows the curve of the brain, stopping only at the [[dural reflection]]s like the [[tentorium cerebelli]] and falx cerebri.

On a [[CT scan]], subdural hematomas are classically crescent-shaped, with a concave surface away from the skull.  However, they can have a convex appearance, especially in the early stage of bleeding.  This may cause difficulty in distinguishing between subdural and epidural hemorrhages.  A more reliable indicator of subdural hemorrhage is its involvement of a larger portion of the cerebral hemisphere since it can cross suture lines, unlike an epidural hemorrhage.  Subdural blood can also be seen as a layering density along the [[tentorium cerebelli]]. This can be a chronic, stable process, since the feeding system is low-pressure. In such cases, subtle signs of bleeding such as effacement of [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] or medial displacement of the junction between [[gray matter]] and [[white matter]] may be apparent.  A chronic bleed can be the same density as brain tissue (called [[isodense]] to brain), meaning that it will show up on CT scan as the same shade as brain tissue, potentially obscuring the finding.

==Treatment==
It is important that a patient receive medical assessment, including a complete [[neurology|neurological]] examination, after any head trauma. A [[CT scan]] or [[MRI scan]] will usually detect significant subdural hematomas.

Treatment of a subdural hematoma depends on its size and rate of growth. Some small subdural hematomas can be managed by careful monitoring until the body heals itself. Other small subdural hematomas can be managed by inserting a temporary small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma; this procedure can be done at the bedside. Large or symptomatic hematomas require a [[craniotomy]], the surgical opening of the [[Human skull|skull]]. A surgeon then opens the [[Dura mater|dura]], removes the [[blood clot]] with suction or irrigation, and identifies and controls sites of [[bleeding]].<ref>{{cite journal

Depending on the size and deterioration, age of the patient, and anaesthetic risk posed, subdural hematomas occassionally require craniotomy for evacuation; most frequently, simple burr holes for drainage; often conservative treatment; and rarely, palliative treatment in patients of extreme age or with no chance of recovery.<ref>{{cite journal|last=de Araújo Silva|first=DO|coauthors=Matis GK, Costa LF, Kitamura MA, de Carvalho Junior EV, Silva Md, Barbosa BA, Pereira CU, da Silva JC, Birbilis TA, de Azevedo Filho HR |title=Chronic subdural hematomas and the elderly: Surgical results from a series of 125 cases: Old "horses" are not to be shot!.|journal=Surg Neurol Int|year=2013|month=March 25|volume=3|page=150|url=http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/text.asp?2012/3/1/150/104744|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>
