The '''mercury-in-glass''' or '''mercury thermometer''' was invented by German physicist [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] in 1714. It consists of a bulb containing [[mercury (element)|mercury]] attached to a [[glass]] tube of narrow diameter; the volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulb. The volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature; the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column a relatively long way up the tube. The space above the mercury may be filled with [[nitrogen]] or it may be at less than [[atmospheric pressure]], a partial [[vacuum]].

In order to calibrate the thermometer, the bulb is made to reach [[thermal equilibrium]] with a temperature standard such as an ice/water mixture, and then with another standard such as water/vapour, and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed points. In principle, thermometers made of different material (e.g., coloured alcohol) might be expected to give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties; in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of true [[thermodynamic temperature]], and so give similar results.

The thermometer was used by the originators of the [[Fahrenheit]] and [[Celsius]] scales.

[[Anders Celsius]], a Swedish scientist, devised the Celsius scale, which was described in his publication ''the origin of the Celsius temperature scale'' in 1742.

Celsius used two fixed points in his scale: the temperature of melting ice and the temperature of boiling water.  This wasn't a new idea, since [[Isaac Newton]] was already working on something similar.  The distinction of  Celsius was to use the condition of melting and not that of freezing. The experiments for reaching a good calibration of his thermometer lasted for 2 winters.  By performing the same experiment over and over again, he discovered that ice always melted at the same calibration mark on the thermometer.  He found a similar fixed point in the calibration of boiling water to [[water vapor|water vapour]] (when this is done to high precision, a variation will be seen with atmospheric pressure; Celsius noted this).  At the moment that he removed the thermometer from the vapour, the mercury level climbed slightly.  This was related to the rapid cooling (and contraction) of the glass.

When Celsius decided to use his own temperature scale, he originally defined his scale "upside-down", i.e. he chose to set the boiling point of pure water at <!--DON'T CHANGE THIS. It's supposed to be the wrong way around. Please check the source. Thanks-->0 °C (212 °F) and the freezing point at 100 °C (32 °F).<ref>{{cite web |title=Anders Celsius 1701–1744 |work=Astronomical Observatory: History |publisher=Uppsala University |url=http://www.astro.uu.se/history/Celsius_eng.html }}</ref> One year later, Frenchman [[Jean-Pierre Christin]] proposed to invert the scale with the freezing point at 0 °C (32 °F) and the boiling point at 100 °C (212 °F).<ref>{{cite book |first=Jacqueline |last=Smith |chapter=Appendix I: Chronology |title=The Facts on File Dictionary of Weather and Climate |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lAfa1orgvwQC&pg=PA246 |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0951-0 |pages=246 |quote=1743 Jean-Pierre Christin inverts the fixed points on Celsius' scale, to produce the scale used today.}}</ref> He named it [[Centigrade]] (100 grades).

Finally, Celsius proposed a method of calibrating a thermometer:

#Place the cylinder of the thermometer in melting ice made of pure water and mark the point where the fluid in the thermometer stabilises.  This point is the freeze/thaw point of water.
#In the same manner mark the point where the fluid stabilises when the thermometer is placed in boiling water vapour.
#Divide the length between the two marks into 100 equal parts.

These points are adequate for approximate calibration but both vary with atmospheric pressure. Nowadays, the [[triple point]] of water is used instead of the freezing point (the triple point occurs at 273.16 kelvins (K), 0.01 °C).

Before the discovery of the true thermodynamic temperature, the thermometer ''defined'' the temperature; thermometers made with different materials would define different temperature scales (a coloured alcohol thermometer would give a slightly different reading than a mercury thermometer at, say half-scale). In practice, several materials gave very similar temperatures to each other and, when discovered, to the thermodynamic temperature.

==Maximum thermometer==
[[File:Clinical thermometer 38.7.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A medical mercury-in-glass maximum thermometer showing the temperature of 38.7 °C.]]
A special kind of mercury-in-glass thermometer, called a maximum thermometer, works by having a constriction in the neck close to the bulb. As the temperature rises, the mercury is pushed up through the constriction by the force of expansion. When the temperature falls, the column of mercury breaks at the constriction and cannot return to the bulb, thus remaining stationary in the tube. The observer can then read the maximum temperature over the set period of time. To reset the thermometer it must be swung sharply. This design is used in the traditional type of [[medical thermometer]].

==Maximum minimum thermometer==
A [[maximum minimum thermometer]], also known as Six's thermometer, is a thermometer which registers the maximum and minimum temperatures reached over a period of time, typically 24 hours. The original design contains mercury, but solely as a way to indicate the position of a column of alcohol whose expansion indicates the temperature; it is not a thermometer operated by the expansion of mercury; mercury-free versions are available.

==Physical properties==
Mercury cannot be used below the [[Melting point|temperature at which it becomes solid]], -38.83 °[[Degree Celsius|C]] (-37.89 °[[Degree Fahrenheit|F]]). If the thermometer contains nitrogen, the gas may flow down into the column when the mercury solidifies and be trapped there when the temperature rises, making the thermometer unusable until returned to the factory for reconditioning. To avoid this, some weather services require that all mercury-in-glass thermometers be brought indoors when the temperature falls to -37 °C (-34.6 °F). To measure lower meteorological temperatures, a thermometer containing a mercury-[[thallium]] [[alloy]] which does not solidify until the temperature drops to -61.1 °C (-78 °F) may be used.

==Phase-out==
{{As of|2012}}, many mercury-in-glass thermometers are used in [[meteorology]]; however, they are becoming increasingly rare for other uses, as many countries banned them for [[medical]] use due to the toxicity of mercury. Some manufacturers use [[galinstan]], a liquid alloy of [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[tin]], as a replacement for mercury.

;Australia<!--stub-->

;Austria
There was a voluntary take-back action for thermometers containing mercury based on the Federal Waste Management Plan 2006, and carried out in close cooperation between the Austrian Chamber of Pharmacists (Österreichische Apothekerkammer), the [[Federal Ministry of Environment]], a private waste disposer, a producer of electronic thermometers and a pharmaceutical distributor. The disposal company supplied each pharmacy (approximately 1,200) with a collection bin and covered the cost of disposal. The pharmaceutical distributor covered the logistical costs for the distribution of the thermometers. The pharmacies accepted a refund of only 0.50 Euro per thermometer for handling (which is far below their normal margin). The supplier provided the thermometers at a reduced price. The Federal Ministry supported each sold thermometer (covering about 30% of the direct costs) and advertised the project. During the collection period, consumers could bring in a mercury thermometer and buy an electronic thermometer for a subsidised price of 1 Euro. Between October 2007 and January 2008, about 465,000 electronic thermometers were sold and about one million mercury thermometers (together containing about 1 tonne of mercury) were collected.<ref>[http://www.chem.unep.ch/mercury/storage/LAC_Docs/LAC_storage_RC_INF_5_SBC%20tech%20guidelines%20on%20ESM%20waste.doc UNEP(DTIE)/Mercury/WG/1/INF/3 Draft Technical Guidelines on the Environmentally Sound Management of Mercury Waste, 2010]</ref>

;Philippines
By the Philippines [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]]’s Administrative Order 2008-0221, all mercury equipment from hospitals, including mercury-in-glass thermometers, will be phased out in the [[Philippines]] by September 28, 2010. Even before the order was released, 50 hospitals have already banned mercury from their establishments. Among these fifty hospitals, the [[Philippine Heart Center]] was the first one to do so. [[San Juan De Dios Educational Foundation|San Juan de Dios Hospital]], [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|Philippine Children’s Medical Center]], [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|San Lazaro Hospital]], [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|Ospital ng Muntinlupa]], [[Lung Center of the Philippines]], the [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|National Kidney and Transplant Institute]], [[Manila Adventist Medical Center]] and [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|Las Piñas Hospital]] also made steps to ban the toxic chemical.
