'''SADDAN''' ('''severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans''') is a rare [[inherited disorder]] of [[bone]] growth characterized by [[skeletal]], [[brain]], and [[skin]] abnormalities.

All people with this condition are extremely short with particularly short arms and legs. Other signs and symptoms include unusual bowing of the leg bones; a small chest with short ribs and curved collar bones; short, broad fingers; and folds of extra skin on the arms and legs. Structural abnormalities of the brain lead to seizures, profound developmental delay, and mental retardation. [[Acanthosis nigricans]], a progressive skin disorder characterized by thick, dark, velvety skin, develops in infancy or early childhood. People with SADDAN often live into childhood and adulthood.

Many of the features of SADDAN are similar to those seen in other skeletal disorders, specifically [[achondroplasia]] and [[thanatophoric dysplasia]].

==Epidemiology==
This disorder is very rare; it has been described in only a small number of individuals worldwide.
