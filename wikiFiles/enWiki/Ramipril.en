'''Ramipril''' is an [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor]], used to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[congestive heart failure]]. It is marketed as '''Prilace''' by [[Arrow Pharmaceuticals]] in [[Australia]], '''Ramipro''' by [[Westfield Pharma]] in the [[Philippines]], '''Tritace''' by [[Sanofi-Aventis]] in Italy and and United States and '''Altace''' by [[King Pharmaceuticals]] in the [[United States]], '''Ramitens''' by PharmaSwiss, '''Ampril''' by Krka in Slovenia, '''Corpril''' by Cemelog-BRS in Hungary, '''Piramil''' and '''Prilinda''' by Hemofarm in Serbia, by Lek in Poland and by Novartis in Bangladesh, and in [[Canada]] as '''Altace''' (Sonfi) and '''Ramipril''' (Pharmascience).

==Medical uses==
Indications for its use include:
* [[Hypertension]];
*[[Congestive heart failure]];<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pilote L, Abrahamowicz M, Eisenberg M, Humphries K, Behlouli H, Tu JV |title=Effect of different angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors on mortality among elderly patients with congestive heart failure |journal=CMAJ |volume=178 |issue=10 |pages=1303–11 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18458262 |pmc=2335176 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060068 |url=}}</ref>
*Following [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in patients with clinical evidence of [[heart failure]];
*Susceptible patients over 55 years: prevention of heart attack, [[stroke]], cardiovascular death or need of [[revascularization]] procedures.
*[[Diabetic nephropathy]] (kidney damage due to diabetes) with [[microalbuminuria]] (protein in the urine)

==[[Contraindication|Contraindications]]==
Renovascular disease (impaired blood flow in the kidneys), severe renal impairment (especially in patients with one kidney or with bilateral [[renal artery stenosis]]), volume-depleted patients, history of [[angioedema]] while on an [[ACE inhibitor]], [[pregnancy]], [[hypotension]].

==Adverse effects==
*low [[blood sugar]] (in patients taking medication for diabetes), causing sweating or shakiness
*[[dry cough]]
*dizziness and light-headedness due to low blood pressure
*tiredness and fatigue, especially in the early stages
*mouth dryness in the early stages
*[[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]] (persistent in rare cases)
*[[fainting]]
*change in amount of urine
*signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, persistent sore throat)
*yellowing of eyes or skin, dark urine
*stomach or abdominal pain
*[[neutropenia]] (low white blood cells)
*impotence (erectile dysfunction)<ref> [http://heart-disease.emedtv.com/ramipril/ramipril-side-effects.html Med Tv] </ref>

Serious [[allergic reactions]] to this drug are unlikely, but immediate medical attention must be sought if they occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include, but are not limited to a [[rash]] or swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat.

In extreme cases, ramipril may lead to potentially fatal liver problems.

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Ramipril 1.25 MG Oral Capsule.jpg|left|thumb|Ramipril 1.25mg oral capsule. {{break}}Letter codes & icons may differ.]]

[[ACE_inhibitor|ACE inhibitors]], as the name suggests, inhibit the actions of [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE), thereby lowering the production of [[angiotensin II]] and also decreasing the breakdown of [[bradykinin]]. The decrease in angiotensin II results in relaxation of [[arteriole]] smooth muscle leading to a decrease in [[total peripheral resistance]], reducing blood pressure as the blood is pumped through widened vessels. Its effect on [[bradykinin]] is responsible for the dry cough [[side effect]].

Ramipril, a [[prodrug]] or precursor drug, is converted to the active [[metabolite]] (metabolic product) ramiprilat by [[liver]] [[esterase]] [[enzyme]]s.<ref Name=Frampton>{{Cite journal|author=Frampton JE, Peters DH |title=Ramipril. An updated review of its therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure |journal=Drugs |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=440–66 |year=1995 |month=March|pmid=7774515 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Ramiprilat is mostly [[excretion|excreted]] by the [[kidney]]s. The [[half-life]] of ramiprilat is variable (3–16 hours), and is prolonged by heart and [[liver failure]], as well as [[renal failure|kidney failure]].

==Patent==
The compound was protected by {{US patent|5,061,722}} which was assigned to [[Aventis]] on 29 October 1991. The patent was scheduled to expire on 29 October 2008. On 11 September  2007, in an appeal by the Indian company [[Lupin Ltd.]], the United States [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] reversed a district court trial verdict and found that Aventis's patent on ramipril was invalid for "obviousness" - opening this medicine to generic manufacturers.

Ramipril is marketed in [[India]] under the brand names of Cardace, Zigpril, Ramistar and Zorem.

==Clinical trials==
The [[Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation|HOPE]] trial<ref>[http://www.hypertensiononline.org/slides2/slide01.cfm?q=ramipril&dpg=10 Hypertension Online Slides - ramipril, mortality, kidney failure, HOPE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://ebm.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/5/2/47 Ramipril reduced mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in high risk adults - 5 (2): 47 - Evidence-Based Medicine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> seemed to show ramipril possessed cardioprotective qualities which extended beyond its qualities as an antihypertensive. However, the HOPE trial and the interpretation of the results have been criticised.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430926 "Debate: Do ACE Inhibitors Have Unique Properties, Beyond Their Antihypertensive Effect?"</ref>

The '''AIRE''' trial<ref name=Frampton/><ref>{{Cite journal|author= |title=Effect of ramipril on mortality and morbidity of survivors of acute myocardial infarction with clinical evidence of heart failure. The Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) Study Investigators |journal=Lancet |volume=342 |issue=8875 |pages=821–8 |year=1993 |month=October |pmid=8104270 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)92693-N |url=}}</ref> showed a 27% reduction in mortality.

Ramipril was found to have similar results as [[telmisartan]], an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist|angiotensin II receptor blocker]] (ARB).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Yusuf S, Teo KK, Pogue J, ''et al'' |title=Telmisartan, ramipril, or both in patients at high risk for vascular events |journal=N.
