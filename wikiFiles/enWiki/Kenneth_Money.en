'''Kenneth Money''' (born April 1, 1935 in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]) is the Senior Scientist at the [[Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine]] in Toronto.  He has published over one hundred science articles and authored six different topics in the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''.  

==Education==
Money attended [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]] for high school. He then enrolled at the [[University of Toronto]] and earned his bachelor of science in physiology and chemistry in 1958, master of science in physiology in 1959 and Ph.D. in physiology in 1961.

==Career==
Some of his contributions in the scientific field include knowledge of the inner ear, [[motion sickness]], [[disorientation]], and biological effects of space flight.  Some of Moneyâ€™s interests include [[badminton]], [[skiing]], [[acrobatic flying]], [[skydiving]], [[fishing]], and reading.  In 1956, Money competed at the [[1956 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and placed fifth in the men's high jump event.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wallechinsky|first1=David|authorlink1=David Wallechinsky|last2=Loucky|first2=Jaime|year=2012|title=The Complete Book of the Olympics 2012 Edition|page=211|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[Aurum Press]]|isbn=978 1 84513 695 6}}</ref>  In 1989, he won the U.S. masters badminton championship in [[Miami]], Florida.

Money was selected by the [[National Research Council of Canada]] as an astronaut candidate in December 1983, but left the [[Canadian Astronaut Corps]] in 1992 without having flown in space.  He acted as [[Spacelab]] Payload Operations Controller for a Spacelab mission in 1992.  

During the same mission, Money served as the alternate astronaut, having the capability to fly if needed. He is credited with the invention of an experimental surgical operation called [[semicircular canal]] plugging, which is now being used in North America and Europe to treat particular types of dizzy spells.  He is also working part time as a professor of physiology for the [[University of Toronto]] and regularly lectures to undergraduate classes.

==Awards and service==
In 1994, he was awarded the Meritorious Service Cross by the [[Governor General]] of Canada for his many contributions to science and technology.

Money is also a member of the volunteer [[Board of Governors]] of the [[National Space Society]], a [[non-profit]] [[space advocacy]] group originally founded by [[Wernher von Braun]].
