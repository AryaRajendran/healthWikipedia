'''Food intolerance''' or '''non-allergic food hypersensitivity''' is a term used widely for varied physiological responses associated with a particular food, or compound found in a range of foods.

Food intolerance is a detrimental reaction, often delayed, to a [[food]], [[beverage]], [[food additive]], or compound found in foods that produces symptoms in one or more body organs and systems, but it is not a true [[food allergy]].  A true food allergy requires the presence of Immunoglobin E ([[IgE]]) antibodies against the food, and a food intolerance does not.

Food intolerances can be classified according to their mechanism.  Intolerance can result from the absence of specific [[chemical]]s or [[enzyme]]s needed to [[digestion|digest]] a food substance, as in [[hereditary fructose intolerance]]. It may be a result of an abnormality in the body's ability to absorb nutrients, as occurs in [[fructose malabsorption]]. Food intolerance reactions can occur to naturally occurring chemicals in foods, as in [[salicylate sensitivity]]. Drugs sourced from plants, such as aspirin, can also cause these kinds of reactions.  Finally, it may be the result of non-IgE-mediated immune responses.

''Non-allergic food hypersensitivity'' is the medical name for food intolerance, loosely referred to as ''food hypersensitivity'', or previously as ''pseudo-allergic reactions''. Non-allergic food hypersensitivity should not be confused with true [[food allergies]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerth van Wijk R, van Cauwenberge PB, Johansson SG |title=[Revised terminology for allergies and related conditions] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Tandheelkd |volume=110 |issue=8 |pages=328–31 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12953386 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Johansson SG |title=Revised nomenclature for allergy for global use: Report of the Nomenclature Review Committee of the World Allergy Organization, October 2003 |journal=J.

Food intolerance reactions can include [[pharmacologic]], metabolic, and gastro-intestinal responses to foods or food compounds. Food intolerance does not include either psychological responses<ref name=pmid11551246 /> or [[foodborne illness]].

A non-allergic food hypersensitivity is an abnormal physiological response. It can be difficult to determine the poorly tolerated substance as reactions can be delayed, dose-dependant, and a particular reaction-causing compound may be found in many foods.<ref>http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Food_allergy_and_intolerance</ref>

*Metabolic food reactions are due to [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn]] or acquired errors of metabolism of nutrients, such as in [[diabetes mellitus]], [[lactase deficiency]], [[phenylketonuria]] and [[favism]].
*Pharmacological reactions are generally due to low-molecular-weight chemicals which occur either as natural compounds, such as [[salicylate sensitivity|salicylates]] and amines, or to [[food additive]]s, such as preservatives, colouring, emulsifiers and taste enhancers. These chemicals are capable of causing drug-like (biochemical) side effects in susceptible individuals.<ref name = "Clarke" />
*Gastro-intestinal reactions can be due to [[malabsorption]] or other GI Tract abnormalities.
*Immunological responses are mediated by non-IgE immunoglobulins, where the immune system recognises a particular food as a foreign body.
*Toxins may either be present naturally in food, be released by bacteria, or be due to contamination of food products.<ref name = "Clarke" /> Toxic food reactions are caused by the direct action of a food or substance without immune involvement.<ref name = "Clarke" />
*Psychological reactions involve manifestation of clinical symptoms caused not by food but by [[emotions]] associated with food. These symptoms do not occur when the food is given in an unrecognisable form.<ref name = "Clarke" />

[[Elimination diet]]s are useful to assist in the diagnosis of food intolerance. There are specific diagnostic tests for certain food intolerances.<ref name = "Clarke" /><ref name="pmid16782524" /><ref name="pmid16687980" />

==Signs and symptoms==

Non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity (food intolerance) is more chronic, less acute, less obvious in its presentation, and often more difficult to diagnose than a food allergy.<ref name="pmid10565387">

Symptoms of food intolerance vary greatly, and can be mistaken for the symptoms of a [[food allergy]]. While true allergies are associated with fast-acting [[immunoglobulin]] IgE responses, it can be difficult to determine the offending food causing a food intolerance because the response generally takes place over a prolonged period of time. Thus the causative agent and the response are separated in time, and may not be obviously related. Food intolerance symptoms usually begin about half an hour after eating or drinking the food in question, but sometimes symptoms may delayed up to 48 h.<ref name="pmid18594978" />

Food intolerance can present with symptoms affecting the skin, [[respiratory tract]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] (GIT) either individually or in combination.

==Causes==

Reactions to chemical components of the diet are more common than true food allergies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} They are caused by various organic chemicals occurring naturally in a wide variety of foods, both of animal and vegetable origin more often than to food additives, preservatives, colourings and flavourings, such as [[sulfite]]s or dyes.<ref name="pmid18971901">

Pharmacological responses to naturally occurring compounds in food, or chemical intolerance, can occur in individuals from both allergic and non-allergic family backgrounds. Symptoms may begin at any age, and may develop quickly or slowly. Triggers may range from a viral infection or illness to environmental chemical exposure. It occurs more commonly in women, which may be because of hormone differences, as many food chemicals mimic hormones.

A deficiency in digestive enzymes can also cause some types of food intolerances. [[Lactose intolerance]] is a result of the body not producing sufficient [[lactase]] to digest the lactose in milk;<ref name="pmid16951027">{{cite journal |author=Heyman MB |title=Lactose intolerance in infants, children, and adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=1279–86 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16951027 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1721 |url= |last2=Committee On |first2=Nutrition}}</ref><ref name="pmid9742907">{{cite journal |author=Srinivasan R, Minocha A |title=When to suspect lactose intolerance.

The classification or avoidance of foods based on botanical families bears no relationship to their chemical content and is not relevant in the management of food intolerance.

Salicylate-containing foods include apples, citrus fruits, strawberries, tomatoes, and wine, while reactions to chocolate, [[cheese]], bananas, avocado, tomato or wine point to amines as the likely food chemical. Thus exclusion of single foods does not necessarily identify the chemical responsible as several chemicals can be present in a food, the patient may be sensitive to multiple food chemicals and reaction more likely to occur when foods containing the triggering substance are eaten in a combined quantity that exceeds the patient's sensitivity thresholds. People with food sensitivities have different sensitivity thresholds, and so more sensitive people will react to much smaller amounts of the substance.<ref name = "Clarke">

==Pathogenesis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}
The term food allergy is widely misused for all adverse reactions to food. Food allergy (FA) is a food hypersensitivity occurring in susceptible individuals, which is mediated by a classical immune mechanism specific for the food itself. The best established mechanism in FA is due to the presence of IgE antibodies against the offending food. Food intolerance (FI) are all other adverse reactions to food. Subgroups of FI are enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase deficiency), pharmacological (e.g. reactions against biogenic amines, histamine intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives).<ref name="pmid19340768">{{cite journal |author=Wüthrich B |title=[Food allergy, food intolerance or functional disorder?] |language=German |journal=Praxis (Bern 1994) |volume=98 |issue=7 |pages=375–87 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19340768 |doi=10.1024/1661-8157.98.7.375 |url=}}</ref> As knowledge of mechanisms and causes of food intolerance improve, nomenclature will be updated.<ref>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology
Volume 113, Issue 5, May 2004, Pages 832-836 {{doi|10.1016/j.jaci.2003.12.591}}</ref> There is no worldwide scientific consensus on the pathogenesis of food intolerance.

Food intolerances can be caused by enzymatic defects in the digestive system, can also result from pharmacological effects of vasoactive amines present in foods (e.g. Histamine),<ref name="pmid16782524" /> among other metabolic, pharmacological and digestive abnormalities.

A frequent misconception among the general public is confusion between cow's milk allergy (CMA) and cow’s milk intolerance, which is usually intolerance to lactose. There are at least two, and possibly more, distinct pathologies. Hypersensitivity to milk is often broadly classified into immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy and non-IgE-mediated intolerance. The immunopathological mechanisms of non-IgE-mediated intolerance in particular remain poorly understood, and this has hindered the development of simple and reliable diagnostics. Adults with non-IgE-mediated intolerance to milk tend to suffer ongoing reactions without the development of tolerance. The precise immunopathological mechanisms of non-IgE-mediated intolerance remain unclear. A number of mechanisms have been implicated, including type-1 T helper cell (Th1) mediated reactions, the formation of immune complexes leading to the activation of Complement, or T-cell/mast cell/neuron interactions inducing functional changes in smooth muscle action and intestinal motility. Food antigens contact the immune system throughout the intestinal tract via the gut associated lymphoid system (GALT), where interactions between antigen presenting cells and T cells direct the type of immune response mounted. Unresponsiveness of the immune system to dietary antigens is termed "oral tolerance" and is believed to involve the deletion or switching off of reactive antigen-specific T cells and the production of regulatory T cells (T reg) that quell inflammatory responses to benign antigens. In the case of IgE-mediated allergies, a deficiency in regulation and a polarisation of specific effector T cells towards type-2 T helper cells (Th2) lead to signalling of B-cells to produce milk protein-specific IgE. Whereas non-IgE-mediated reactions (intolerances) may be due to Th1 mediated inflammation. Dysfunctional T reg cell activity has been identified as a factor in both allergy/ intolerance mechanisms.<ref name="pmid16373958" />

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of food intolerance can include [[hydrogen breath test]]ing for [[lactose intolerance]] and [[fructose malabsorption]], professionally supervised [[elimination diet]]s, and ELISA testing for IgG-mediated immune responses to specific foods. It is important to be able to distinguish between food allergy, food intolerance, and autoimmune disease in the management of these disorders.<ref name="pmid9196849">

==Prevention==
There is emerging evidence from studies of cord bloods that both sensitization and the acquisition of tolerance can begin in pregnancy, however the window of main danger for sensitization to foods extends prenatally, remaining most critical during early infancy when the immune system and intestinal tract are still maturing. There is no conclusive evidence to support the restriction of dairy intake in the maternal diet during pregnancy in order to prevent. This is generally not recommended since the drawbacks in terms of loss of nutrition can out-weigh the benefits. However, further randomised, controlled trials are required to examine if dietary exclusion by lactating mothers can truly minimize risk to a significant degree and if any reduction in risk is out-weighed by deleterious impacts on maternal nutrition.<ref name="pmid16373958">

==Management==
Individuals can try minor changes of diet to exclude foods causing obvious reactions, and for many this may be adequate without the need for professional assistance. For reasons mentioned above foods causing problems may not be so obvious since food sensitivities may not be noticed for hours or even days after one has digested food. Persons unable to isolate foods and those more sensitive or with disabling symptoms should seek expert medical and dietitian help. The dietetic department of a [[teaching hospital]] is a good start. (see links below)

Guidance can also be given to your general practitioner to assist in diagnosis and management. Food [[elimination diet]]s have been designed to exclude food chemicals likely to cause reactions and foods commonly causing true allergies and those foods where [[enzyme deficiency]] cause symptoms. These [[elimination diet]]s are not everyday diets but intended to isolate problem foods and chemicals. Avoidance of foods with additives is also essential in this process.

Individuals and practitioners need to be aware that during the elimination process patients can display aspects of food addiction, masking, withdrawals, and further sensitization and intolerance. Those foods that an individual considers as 'must have every day' are suspect addictions, this includes tea, coffee, chocolate and health foods and drinks, as they all contain food chemicals. Individuals are also unlikely to associate foods causing problems because of masking or where separation of time between eating and symptoms occur. The elimination process can overcome addiction and unmask problem foods so that the patients can associate cause and effect.

It takes around five days of total abstinence to unmask a food or chemical, during the first week on an [[elimination diet]] withdrawal symptoms can occur but it takes at least two weeks to remove residual traces. If symptoms have not subsided after six weeks, food intolerance is unlikely to be involved and a normal diet should be restarted. Withdrawals are often associated with a lowering of the threshold for sensitivity which assists in challenge testing, but in this period individuals can be ultra-sensitive even to food smells so care must be taken to avoid all exposures.

After two or more weeks if the symptoms have reduced considerably or gone for at least five days then challenge testing can begin. This can be carried out with selected foods containing only one food chemical, so as to isolate it if reactions occur. In Australia, purified food chemicals in capsule form are available to doctors for patient testing. These are often combined with [[placebo]] capsules for control purposes. (See link below.) This type of challenge is more definitive. New challenges should only be given after 48 hours if no reactions occur or after five days of no symptoms if reactions occur.

Once all food chemical sensitivities are identified a [[dietitian]] can prescribe an appropriate diet for the individual to avoid foods with those chemicals. Lists of suitable foods are available from various hospitals and patient support groups can give local food brand advice. A dietitian will ensure adequate nutrition is achieved with safe foods and supplements if need be.

Over a period of time it is possible for individuals avoiding food chemicals to build up a level of resistance by regular exposure to small amounts in a controlled way, but care must be taken, the aim being to build up a varied diet with adequate composition.<ref name = "Clarke" /><ref name="pmid17206644" /><ref name="pmid16635922" /><ref name="pmid9196849"/><ref name="pmid10972377">

Out of 4,622 subjects with adequately filled-in questionnaires, 84 were included in the study (1.8%) Perceived food intolerance is a common problem with significant nutritional consequences in a population with IBS. Of these 59 (70%) had symptoms related to intake of food, 62% limited or excluded food items from the diet.
Tests were performed for food allergy and malabsorption, but not for intolerance. There were no associations between the tests for food allergy and malabsorption and perceived food intolerance, among those with IBS. Perceived food intolerance was unrelated to musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders.<ref name="pmid16391571">

In 1978 Australian researchers published details of an 'exclusion diet' to exclude specific food chemicals from the diet of patients. This provided a basis for challenge with these additives and natural chemicals. Using this approach the role played by dietary chemical factors in the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) was first established and set the stage for futute DBPCT trials of such substances in food intolerance studies.<ref name="pmid661687">

In 1995 the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology suggested a classification on the basis of the responsible pathogenetic mechanism; according to this classification, non-toxic reactions can be divided into 'food allergies' when they recognize immunological mechanisms, and 'food intolerances' when there are no immunological implications. Reactions secondary to food ingestion are defined generally as 'adverse reactions to food'.<ref name="pmid18431058">

==Society and culture==
In the UK, scepticism about food intolerance as a specific condition influenced doctors' (GPs') perceptions of patients and of the patients' underlying problems. However, rather than risk damaging the [[doctor-patient relationship]], GPs chose - despite their scepticism and guided by an element of awareness of the limitations of modern medicine - to negotiate mutually acceptable ground with patients and with patients' beliefs . As a result, whether due to a placebo effect, a secondary benefit, or a biophysical result of excluding a food from the diet, the GPs acknowledge both personal and therapeutic benefits.<ref name="pmid18584930" />

In the Netherlands, patients and their doctors (GPs) have different perceptions of the efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS. Patients consider food intolerance and GPs regard lack of fibre as the main etiologic dietary factor. GPs should explore the patients' expectations and incorporate these in their approach to IBS patients.<ref name="pmid12813601">

In the USA food companies propose distinguishing between food allergy and food intolerance and use a mechanism-based (i.e., immunoglobulin-E-mediated), acute life-threatening anaphylaxis that is standardized and measurable and reflects the severity of health risk, as the principal inclusion criterion for food allergen labeling.<ref name="pmid10914674">

}}</ref> Restriction of Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-
saccharides and Polyols globally, rather than individually, controls the symptoms of functional gut disorders (e.g. IBS), and the majority of IBD patients respond just as well. It is more successful than restricting only Fructose and Fructans, which are also FODMAPs, as is recommended for those with [[Fructose malabsorption]]. Longer term compliance with the diet was high.

A randomised controlled trial on IBS patients found relaxing an IgG-mediated food intolerance diet led to a 24% greater deterioration in symptoms compared to those on the elimination diet and concluded food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.<ref name="pmid">
