'''Subcutaneous emphysema''', sometimes abbreviated '''SCE''' or '''SE''' and also called '''tissue emphysema''', or '''Sub Q air''', occurs when gas or air is present in the [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] layer of the skin. ''Subcutaneous'' refers to the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] beneath the [[Cutis (anatomy)|cutis]] of the [[Human skin|skin]], and ''[[emphysema]]'' refers to trapped air.  Since the air generally comes from the [[chest cavity]], subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where it is able to travel from the chest cavity along the [[fascia]].<ref name="pleural">

Numerous etiologies of subcutaneous emphysema have been described. [[Pneumomediastinum]] was first recognized as a medical entity by [[René Laennec|Laennec]], who reported it as a consequence of trauma in 1819. Later, in 1939, at [[The Johns Hopkins Hospital]], Dr. Louis Hamman described it in [[postpartum]] woman; indeed, subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes known as [[Hamman's syndrome]]. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as [[Macklin's Syndrome]] after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumaltively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.<ref name=macklin>{{Cite journal

Subcutaneous emphysema can result from puncture of parts of the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] or [[gastrointestinal system]]s.  Particularly in the [[thorax|chest]] and neck, air may become trapped as a result of [[penetrating trauma]] (e.g., [[gunshot wound]]s or stab wounds) or [[blunt trauma]]. [[Infection]]  (e.g., [[gas gangrene]]) can cause gas to be trapped in the subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous emphysema can be caused by medical procedures and medical conditions that cause the pressure in the [[alveoli]] of the lung to be higher than that in the tissues outside of them.<ref name="Maunder84">

Subcutaneous emphysema is often found in car accident victims because of the force of the crash. 

[[Chest trauma]], a major cause of subcutaneous emphysema, can cause air to enter the skin of the chest wall from the neck or lung.<ref name="Brown04"/> When the [[pleura]]l membranes are punctured, as occurs in penetrating trauma of the chest, air may travel from the lung to the muscles and subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall.<ref name="Brown04"/>  When the alveoli of the lung are ruptured, as occurs in [[pulmonary laceration]], air may travel beneath the [[visceral pleura]] (the membrane lining the lung), to the [[Hilum of lung|hilum of the lung]], up to the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], to the neck and then to the chest wall.<ref name="Brown04"/> The condition may also occur when a [[rib fracture|fractured rib]] punctures a lung;<ref name="Brown04"/> in fact, 27% of patients who have rib fractures also have subcutaneous emphysema.<ref name="Schnyder00"/>  Rib fractures may tear the [[parietal pleura]], the membrane lining the inside of chest wall, allowing air to escape into the subcutaneous tissues.<ref name="Wicky00">

</ref>  These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck, with an immediate onset, the [[crepitus]] (crunching sound) typical of subcutaneous emphysema, and often with subcutaneous air visible on X-ray.<ref name="Monsour89"/>

One of the main causes of subcutaneous emphysema, along with pneumothorax, is an improperly functioning chest tube.<ref name="Lefor02"/>  Thus subcutaneous emphysema is often a sign that something is wrong with a chest tube; it may be clogged, clamped, or out of place.<ref name="Lefor02"/> The tube may need to be replaced, or, when large amounts of air are leaking, a new tube may be added.<ref name="Lefor02"/>

Since [[mechanical ventilation]] can worsen a pneumothorax, it can force air into the tissues; when subcutaneous emphysema occurs in a ventilated patient, it is an indication that the ventilation may have caused a pneumothorax.<ref name="Lefor02"/> It is not unusual for subcutaneous emphysema to result from [[positive pressure ventilation]].<ref name="Conetta93"/>  Another possible cause is a ruptured trachea.<ref name="Lefor02"/>  The trachea may be injured by [[tracheostomy]] or [[tracheal intubation]]; in cases of tracheal injury, large amounts of air can enter the subcutaneous space.<ref name="Lefor02"/> An [[endotracheal tube]] can puncture the trachea or bronchi and cause subcutaneous emphysema.<ref name="Peart06"/>

===Infection===
Air can be trapped under the skin in [[necrotizing]] infections such as [[gangrene]], occurring as a late sign in gas gangrene,<ref name="Lefor02"/> of which it is the [[hallmark]] sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of [[fournier gangrene]].<ref name="Levenson08">

</ref> Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the [[infection]] is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.<ref name="Brown04"/><ref name="Molen99"/>

==Pathophysiology==

<!--image of fascia?-->
Air is able to travel to the soft tissues of the neck from the mediastinum and the [[retroperitoneum]] (the space behind the [[abdominal cavity]]) because these areas are connected by fascial planes.<ref name="Maunder84"/>  From the punctured lungs or airways, the air travels up the [[perivascular cell|perivascular]] sheaths and into the mediastinum, from which it can enter the subcutaneous tissues.<ref name="Findlay03"/> 

Spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema is thought to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture.<ref name="Parker90"/> In spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the [[interstitium]] and along the [[blood vessel]]s of the lung, into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.<ref name="Parker90"/>

==Diagnosis==
Significant cases of subcutaneous emphysema are easy to diagnose because of the characteristic signs of the condition.<ref name="pleural"/> In some cases, the signs are subtle, making diagnosis more difficult.<ref name="Wicky00"/> [[Medical imaging]] is used to diagnose the condition or confirm a diagnosis made using clinical signs. On a chest [[radiograph]], subcutaneous emphysema may be seen as [[radiodensity|radiolucent]] striations in the pattern expected from the [[pectoralis major]] muscle group. Air in the subcutaneous tissues may interfere with [[radiography]] of the chest, potentially obscuring serious conditions such as pneumothorax.<ref name="Criner02"/> It can also and reduce the effectiveness of chest [[ultrasound]].<ref name="Gravenstein07">
{{cite book |author=Gravenstein N, Lobato E, Kirby RM |title=Complications in Anesthesiology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |page= 171 |isbn=0-7817-8263-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-05-12 | url= http://books.google.com/?id=S0usnJnJKjUC&pg=PA171&dq=subcutaneous+emphysema
}}
</ref>  On the other hand, since subcutaneous emphysema may become apparent in [[chest X-ray]]s before a pneumothorax does, its presence may be used to infer that of the latter injury.<ref name="Wicky00"/> Subcutaneous emphysema can also be seen in [[Computerized tomography|CT scan]]s, with the air pockets appearing as dark areas. CT scanning is so sensitive that it commonly makes it possible to find the exact spot from which air is entering the soft tissues.<ref name="Wicky00"/>  In 1994, M.T. Macklin and C.C. Macklin published further insights into the pathophysiology of  spontaneous Macklin's Syndrome occurring from a severe asthmatic attack.

The presence of subcutaneous emphysema in a person who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very suggestive of the diagnosis of [[Boerhaave's syndrome]] which is a life threatening emergency caused by rupture of the distal esophagus.

==Treatment==

Subcutaneous emphysema is usually [[benign]].<ref name="pleural"/> Most of the time, SCE itself does not need treatment (though the conditions from which it results may); however, if the amount of air is large, it can interfere with breathing and be uncomfortable.<ref name="Abu-Omar95">

</ref> It occasionally progresses to a state "Massive Subcutaneous Emphysema" which is quite uncomfortable and requires surgical drainage. When the amount of air pushed out of the airways or lung becomes massive, usually due to [[Modes of mechanical ventilation|positive pressure ventilation]], the eyelids swell so much that the patient cannot see. Also the pressure of the air may impede the blood flow to the areolae of the breast and skin of the scrotum or labia. This can lead to necrosis of the skin in these areas. The latter are urgent situations requiring rapid, adequate decompression.<ref name=maunder>

</ref>  When subcutaneous emphysema occurs due to pneumothorax, a chest tube is frequently used to control the latter; this eliminates the source of the air entering the subcutaneous space.<ref name="Lefor02"/>  If the volume of subcutaneous air is increasing, it may be that the chest tube is not removing air rapidly enough, so it may be replaced with a larger one.<ref name="Long95"/> Suction may also be applied to the tube to remove air faster.<ref name="Long95"/> The progression of the condition can be monitored by marking the boundaries with a special pencil for marking on skin.<ref name="Carpenito04"/>

Since treatment usually involves dealing with the underlying condition, cases of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema may require nothing more than bed rest, medication to control pain, and perhaps supplemental oxygen.<ref name="Parker90"/> Breathing oxygen may help the body to absorb the subcutaneous air more quickly.<ref name="NOAA91">

==Prognosis==
Air in subcutaneous tissue does not usually pose a lethal threat;<ref name="Maunder84"/> small amounts of air are reabsorbed by the body.<ref name="Long95"/>  Once the pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum that causes the subcutaneous emphysema is resolved, with or without medical intervention, the subcutaneous emphysema will usually clear.<ref name="Criner02"/>  However, spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema can, in rare cases, progress to a life-threatening condition,<ref name="Parker90"/> and subcutaneous emphysema due to mechanical ventilation may induce ventilatory failure.<ref name="Conetta93">

==History==
The first report of subcutaneous emphysema resulting from air in the mediastinum was made in 1850 in a patient who had been coughing violently.<ref name="Parker90"/>  In 1900, the first recorded case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]r for the [[Royal Marines]] who had had a tooth extracted: playing the instrument had forced air through the hole where the tooth had been and into the tissues of his face.<ref name="Parker90"/>  Since then, another case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a submariner for the US Navy who had had a [[Endodontic therapy|root canal]] in the past; the increased pressure in the submarine forced air through it and into his face. In recent years a case was reported at the University Hospital of Wales of a young man who had been coughing violently causing a rupture in the esophagus resulting in SE.<ref name="Parker90"/>  The cause of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was clarified between 1939 and 1944 by Macklin, contributing to the current understanding of the [[pathophysiology]] of the condition.<ref name="Parker90"/>
