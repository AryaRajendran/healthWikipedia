Czeisler’s research focus is the neurobiology of human [[circadian rhythms|circadian rhythm]].

Czeisler’s work has many important applications. He showed that sleep deprivation could have adverse consequences like health problems including obesity, diabetes, among others.<ref name = "Li">Li MD, Li CM, Wang Z. “The role of circadian clocks in metabolic disease”. Yale Journal Biol Med. 2012 Sep;85(3):387-401. Epub 2012 Sep 25.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447202/]</ref><ref name = "Munch"></ref><ref name = "NSFtech" /> He has also investigated the effects of chronic sleep deprivation and restriction, night shifts, and circadian disruption, on neurobehavioral performance and metabolism <ref name = "Kavrana">Kavarana MN, Sade RM. “Ethical issues in cardiac surgery”.

Furthermore, Czeisler studied how sleep deprivation impairs the psychomotor performance of night shift workers (2009-2014) <ref name = "NSFtech" />, specifically surgeons (2009-2013)<ref name = "Kavrana"></ref> and residents (2010), police officers (2004-2008) <ref name = "NSFpolice">“Sleep disorders linked to poor health and reduced occupational performance in police officers”. National Sleep Foundation. Jan 3, 2012[http://www.sleepfoundation.org/alert/sleep-disorders-linked-poor-health-and-reduced-occupational-performance-police-officers]</ref>, and truck drivers (2012). Other research interests of his include studying wakefulness, sleep deprivation and how it can be prevented, and influences on the clock like exercise and age.<ref name = "NSFtech" /> Czeisler’s research can be applied to medicine, [[effects of sleep deprivation in space|space travel]], and night occupations including shift-work.<ref name = "Takahashi"> </ref> <ref name = "Kavrana"></ref>

=Sleep Health and Occupational Safety=
In a 1999 interview with the Harvard Gazette regarding his team's characterization of a near-24-hour human circadian period, Dr. Czeisler noted that “accepting the near-24-hour period means that all the ideas about daily human rhythms that we take for granted must be rethought.”<ref name = "24hrclock">"Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour." Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2013.</ref> Understanding the internal circadian period makes problems dealing with jet-lag, night shifts, and sleep schedules in orbit more approachable

Guided by the significant real-life implications of his research, Dr. Czeisler is a strong advocate for healthy sleep habits. In consulting with the Boston Celtics and Portland Trailblazers for the [[National Basketball Association|National Basketball Association (NBA)]], he emphasized sleep as the “third pillar of health” alongside nutrition and exercise.<ref name = "espngosleep">Ortiz, Maria B. "To Sleep, Perchance to Win." ESPN. ESPN Internet Ventures, 04 Dec. 2009. Web. 23 Apr. 2013.</ref> He instituted structural changes to the teams' schedules to allow for healthier sleep habits including pushing morning practices into the afternoon and the '2 a.m. rule' which prevents players from traveling if they are going to arrive at their hotel later than 2:00 am.<ref name = "espngosleep" /> <ref name = "bostonmag">Flannery, Paul. "Person of Interest: Charles Czeisler." Boston Magazine. Metrocorp Inc., May 2011. Web. 22 Apr. 2013.</ref>


According to Dr. Czeisler, sleep deficit poses a significant individual and public health hazard as demonstrated by the significant contribution of drowsiness to workplace accidents and motor vehicle accidents. In an interview with the Harvard Business Review, he explains that companies should seek to address this problem by setting behavioral expectations and scheduling policies for employees to avoid accruing sleep deficit.<ref name = "sleepdeficit">Czeisler, Charles. “Sleep Deficit: The Performance Killer A Conversation with Charles A. Czeisler by Bronwyn Fryer.” Harvard Business Review. Bronwyn Fryer. Boston: Harvard Business Review, October 2006.</ref>

In order to implement improved occupational sleep scheduling and sleep health standards as effective public policy, Dr. Czeisler has served on and consulted to numerous national and international health advisory agencies. As President of the [[National Sleep Foundation]] from 2005-2006, he chaired the Presidential Task Force on Sleep and Public Policy in order to develop model legislation regarding physician-in-training work hours.<ref name = "HarvardFacultyProfile" /> <ref name = "PastPresidents">"Past Presidents."
