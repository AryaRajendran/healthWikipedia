The '''fight-or-flight response''' (also called the '''fight-or-flight-or-freeze response''', '''hyperarousal''', or the '''acute stress response''') is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived [[Psychological trauma|harmful event]], [[Trauma (medicine)|attack]], or threat to survival.<ref name="Cannon - Fight or Flight Response">{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=Walter|title=Wisdom of the Body|year=1932|publisher=W.W.

==Physiology==

===Autonomic nervous system===
{{See also|Autonomic nervous system}}
The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiratory rate]], [[pupillary dilation|Pupillary response]], [[Micturition|urination]], and [[sexual arousal]]. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the flight or fight response and its role is mediated by two different components.<ref name="Human Physiology - Janig">{{cite book|editor-last=Janig|editor-first=W|title=Human Physiology|year=1989|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York, NY|pages=333-370|author=Schmidt, A; Thews, G|edition=2|chapter=Autonomic Nervous System}}</ref> 

'''Sympathetic nervous system''' 
{{See also|Sympathetic nervous system}}
The [[Sympathetic Nervous System]] originates in the [[spinal cord]] and its main function is to activate the physiological changes that occur during the fight or flight response. This component of the Autonomic Nervous System utilizes and activates the release of norepinephrine in the reaction.<ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler">{{cite web|last=Chudler|first=Eric|title=Neuroscience For Kids|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/auto.html|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref> 

'''Parasympathetic nervous system''' 
{{See also|Parasympathetic nervous system}}
The [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]] originates in the spinal cord and [[medulla]] and works in concert with the sympathetic nervous system. Its main function is to activate the "rest and digest" response and return the body to [[homeostasis]] after the fight or flight response. This system utilizes and activates the release of  the neurotransmitter [[Acetylcholine]].<ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler" /> 

===Reaction===
The reaction begins in the [[amygdala]], which triggers a neural response in the [[hypothalamus]]. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the [[pituitary gland]] and secretion of the hormone [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]].<ref name="ACTH Action">{{cite web|last=Margioris|first=Andrew|title=ACTH Action on the Adrenal|url=http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm|publisher=Endotext.org|accessdate=18 April 2013|coauthors=Tsatsanis, Christos|month=April|year=2011}}</ref> The [[Adrenal Gland]] is activated almost simultaneously and releases the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Epinephrine]]. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone [[Cortisol]], which increases [[blood pressure]], [[blood sugar]], and suppresses the [[immune system]].<ref name="physiological reactions - Padgett & Glaser">{{cite journal|last=Padgett|first=David|coauthors=Glaser, R|title=How stress influences the immune response|journal=Trends in Immunology|year=2003|month=August|volume=24|issue=8|pages=444-448|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to [[cells (biology)|Liver cells]] and the subsequent production of [[glucose]].<ref name="Glycogen Metabolism - King">{{cite web|last=King|first=Michael|title=PATHWAYS: GLYCOGEN & GLUCOSE|url=http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/diagrams/glycogen.htm|publisher=Washington University, St. Louis}}</ref> Additionally, the circulation of Cortisol functions to turn [[fatty acids]] into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response.<ref name="Cell Communication in Fight or Flight">{{cite web|title=HOW CELLS COMMUNICATE DURING THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/|publisher=University of Utah|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> [[Catecholamine]] hormones, such as [[adrenaline]] or [[noradrenaline]], facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent [[muscular]] action.

===Function of physiological changes===
The physiological changes that occur during the fight or flight response are activated in order to give the body increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running. Some of the specific physiological changes and their functions include:<ref name="Physiological Changes - Tripod">{{cite web|last=Stress Management for Health Course|title=The Fight Flight Response|url=http://stresscourse.tripod.com/id11.html|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="The Science of Stress - Olpin">{{cite web|last=Olpin|first=Michael|title=The Science of Stress|url=http://faculty.weber.edu/molpin/healthclasses/1110/bookchapters/stressphysiologychapter.htm|publisher=Weber State University}}</ref>
* Increased [[blood flow]] to the muscles activated by diverting blood flow from other parts of the body.
* Increased blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugars, and fats in order to supply the body with extra energy.
* The [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] function of the body speeds up in order to prevent [[bleeding|excessive blood loss]] in the event of an injury sustained during the response.
* Increased [[Muscle tone|muscle tension]] in order to provide the body with extra speed and strength.
* The pupils dilate to help see with increased clarity.
* Increased [[perspiration]] to prevent over-heating due to the increased metabolic rate.

==Evolutionary perspective==
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that early humans had to react to threatening stimuli quickly and did not have time to psychologically and physically prepare themselves. The fight or flight response provided [[prehistoric]] humans with the mechanisms to rapidly respond to threats against survival.<ref name="Purpose of fight or fight - Grohol">{{cite web|last=Grohol|first=John|title=What's the purpose of the fight or flight response?|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2012/12/04/whats-the-purpose-of-the-fight-or-flight-response/|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="Concepts of Stress - Goldstein">{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=David|coauthors=Kopin, I|title=Evolution of concepts of stress|journal=Stress|year=2007|volume=10|issue=2}}</ref>    

===Examples===
A typical example of the stress response is a grazing [[zebra]]. If the zebra sees a [[lion]] closing in for the kill, the stress response is activated. The escape requires intense muscular effort, supported by all of the body’s systems. The [[sympathetic nervous system]]’s activation provides for these needs. A similar example involving fight is of a cat about to be attacked by a dog. The cat shows accelerated heartbeat, [[piloerection]] (hair standing on end, normally for conservation of heat), and pupil dilation, all signs of sympathetic arousal.<ref name=gleitman/> Note that the zebra and cat still maintain [[homeostasis]] in all states.

===Varieties of responses===
Animals respond to threats in many complex ways. Rats, for instance, try to escape when threatened, but will fight when cornered. Some animals stand perfectly still so that predators will not see them. Many animals freeze or play dead when touched in the hope that the predator will lose interest.

Other animals have alternative self-protection methods. Some species of [[cold-blooded]] animals [[Chromatophore|change color]] swiftly, to camouflage themselves.<ref name="Fish changing colors">{{cite book|last=Gill|first=A.C.|title=Revision of the Indo-Pacific dottyback fish subfamily Pseudochrominae (Perciformes: Pseudochromidae)|year=2004|publisher=Smithiana Monographs|pages=1-123}}</ref>  These responses are triggered by the sympathetic nervous system, but, in order to fit the model of fight or flight, the idea of flight must be broadened to include escaping capture either in a physical or sensory way. Thus, flight can be disappearing to another location or just disappearing in place. And often both fight and flight are combined in a given situation.

The fight or flight actions also have polarity – the individual can either fight or flee against something that is threatening, such as a hungry lion, or fight for or fly towards something that is needed, such as the safety of the shore from a raging river.

A threat from another animal does not always result in immediate fight or flight. There may be a period of heightened awareness, during which each animal interprets behavioral signals from the other. Signs such as paling, piloerection, immobility, sounds, and body language communicate the status and intentions of each animal. There may be a sort of negotiation, after which fight or flight may ensue, but which might also result in playing, mating, or nothing at all. An example of this is kittens playing: each kitten shows the signs of sympathetic arousal, but they never inflict real damage.

Males and females tend to deal with stressful situations differently. Males are more likely to respond to an emergency situation with aggression (fight), while females are more likely to flee (flight), turn to others for help, or attempt to defuse the situation – '[[tend and befriend]]'. During stressful times, a mother is especially likely to show protective responses toward her offspring and affiliate with others for shared social responses to a threat.<ref name=females>{{cite journal |url=http://bbh.hhdev.psu.edu/labs/bbhsl/PDF%20files/taylor%20et%20al.%202000.pdf |title=Biobehavioral responses to stress in females: Tend-and-befriend, not fight-or-flight | author=[[Shelley Elizabeth Taylor]], LC Klein, BP Lewis| journal =[[Psychological Review]] | volume = | issue = | pages = |accessdate=2010-10-04 |quote=First described by Walter Cannon in '''1932''', the fight-or-flight response is characterized physiologically by sympathetic nervous system activation that innervates the adrenal medulla, producing a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines, especially ...  |work= }}</ref>

In current times, these responses persist, but fight and flight responses have assumed a wider range of behaviors. For example, the fight response may be manifested in angry, argumentative behavior, and the flight response may be manifested through social withdrawal, substance abuse, and even television viewing.<ref>Friedman, H. S., & Silver, R. C. (Eds.) (2007). Foundations of Health Psychology. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref></blockquote>

==Emotional components==

===Emotion regulation===
{{See also|Emotional self-regulation}}
In the context of the fight or flight response, emotional regulation is used to proactively avoid threats of stress or to control the level of emotional arousal.<ref name="Emotional Regulation - Cistler">{{cite journal|last=Cistler|first=Josh|coauthors=Bunmi O. Olatunji,  Matthew T. Feldner, and John P.

===Emotional reactivity===
During the reaction, the intensity of emotion that is brought on by the stimulus will also determine the nature and intensity of the behavioral response.<ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Avero">{{cite journal|last=Avero|first=Pedro|coauthors=Calvo, M|title=Emotional reactivity to social-evaluative stress: genderdifferences in response systems concordance|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1|year=1999|month=July|volume=27|issue=1|pages=155-170}}</ref> Individuals with higher levels of emotional reactivity may be prone to [[anxiety]] and [[aggression]], which further illustrates the further implications of appropriate emotional reaction in the fight or flight response.<ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Carthy">{{cite journal|last=Carthy|first=T|coauthors=Horesh N, Apter A, Edge MD, Gross JJ|title=Emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in anxious children.|journal=Behavior Research and Therapy|year=2010|month=May|volume=48|issue=5|pages=384-393}}</ref><ref name="Emotional reactivity - Valiente">{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C|coauthors=Eisenberg N, Smith CL, Reiser M, Fabes RA, Losoya S, Guthrie IK, Murphy BC|title=The relations of effortful control and reactive control to children’s externalizing problems: A longitudinal assessment.|journal=Personality|year=2003|month=December|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1171-1196}}</ref> 

==Cognitive components==

===Content specificity===
The specific components of cognitions in the fight or flight response seem to be largely negative. These negative cognitions may be characterized by: attention to negative stimuli, the perception of ambiguous situations as negative, and the recurrence of recalling negative words.<ref name="Content specificity - Reid">{{cite journal|coauthors=Sophie C. Reid, Karen Salmon, Peter F. Lovibond|title=Cognitive Biases in Childhood Anxiety, Depression, and Aggression: Are They Pervasive or Specific?|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|year=2006|month=October|volume=30|issue=5|pages=531-549}}</ref> There are also may be specific negative thoughts associated with emotions commonly seen in the reaction.<ref name="Content Specificity - Beck">{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Aaron|title=Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders|year=1979|publisher=Penguin Books|location=United States}}</ref> 

===Perception of control===
Perceived control relates to an individual's thoughts about control over situations and events.<ref name="Perceived Control - Weems">{{cite journal|last=Weems|first=CF|coauthors=Silverman, WK|title=An integrative model of control: implications for understanding emotion regulation and dysregulation in childhood anxiety.|journal=Journal of Affective disorders|year=2006|month=April|volume=91|issue=2|pages=113-124}}</ref> Perceived control should be differentiated from actual control because an individual's beliefs about their abilities may not reflect their actual abilities. Therefore, overestimation or underestimation of perceived control can lead to anxiety and agression.<ref name="Perceived Control - Brendgen">{{cite journal|last=Brendgen|first=M|coauthors=Vitaro F, Turgeon L, Poulin F, Wanner B|title=Is there a dark side of positive illusions? Overestimation of social competence and subsequent adjustment in aggressive and nonaggressive children|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|year=2004|month=June|volume=32|issue=3|pages=305-320}}</ref> 

===Social information processing===
{{See also|Social information processing (cognition)}}
The social information processing model proposes a variety of factors that determine behavior in the context of social situations and preexisting thoughts.<ref name="Social Information Processing - Crick">{{cite journal|last=Crick|first=Nicki|coauthors=Dodge, Kenneth|title=A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1994|month=January|volume=115|issue=1|pages=74-101}}</ref> The attribution of hostility, especially in ambiguous situations, seems to be one of the most important cognitive factors associated with the fight or flight response because of its implications towards aggression.<ref name="Social Information Processing - Dodge">{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=Kenneth|title=Social cognition and children’s aggressive behavior|journal=Journal of Child Development|date=1980|month=March|volume=51|issue=1|pages=162-170}}</ref> 

==Negative effects of the stress response in humans==
{{See also|Stress (biology)}}
The stress response temporarily suppresses various biological processes including: sexual responses and digestive mechanisms. This is in an effort to focus on the [[stressor]] situation. While the fight or flight response is an adaptive reaction, prolonged increases in stress can cause a variety of negative physiological and psychological negative effects, including:<ref name="Stress Symptoms - Mayo Clinic">{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Stress symptoms: Effects on your body, feelings and behavior|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stress-symptoms/SR00008_D|publisher=Mayo Clinic}}</ref> 

'''Physiological effects''' 
* [[Headaches]]
* Muscle tension and pain
* [[Chest pain]]
* [[Fatigue]]
* Changes in [[Libido|sex drive]]
* [[Dyspepsia|Upset stomach]]
* [[Sleep disorder|Problems with sleeping]]

'''Psychological effects''' 
* [[Anxiety]]
* Restlessness
* Lack of [[motivation]] or focus
* [[Irritability]] or [[anger]]
* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]

'''Behavioral effects''' 
* [[Overeating]] or [[Malnutrition|undereating]]
* [[substance abuse|Drug or alcohol abuse]]
* Social withdrawal

Prolonged stress responses may result in chronic suppression of the [[immune system]], leaving the body open to infections. However, there is a short boost of the immune system shortly after the fight or flight response has been activated. This may have filled an ancient need to fight the infections in a wound that one may have received during interaction with a predator.

Stress responses are sometimes a result of mental disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], in which the individual shows a stress response when remembering a past trauma, and [[panic disorder]], in which the stress response is activated by the catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily sensations.

For potential positive meanings, reference can be made to [[Hans Selye]]'s psychological concept of [[eustress]] or good, healthy stress.
