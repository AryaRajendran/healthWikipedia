'''Informed refusal''' is a medico-[[law|legal]] concept whereby a person can be said to have given [[No (word)|refusal]] to an intervention based upon an understanding of the facts and of the implications of not following a recommended diagnostic or therapeutic action.<ref name="ACS">{{cite web| url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_2X_Informed_Consent.asp| title=Informed Consent| author=[[American Cancer Society]]| accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref><ref name="Goodman">{{Cite journal |author=James M.

The individual needs to be in possession of the relevant facts as well as of his reasoning faculties, such as not being [[mentally retarded]] or [[mentally ill]] and without an [[Disability|impairment]] of [[judgment]] at the time of refusing.  Such impairments might include illness, [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[drunkenness]], [[Psychoactive drug|using drug]]s, insufficient [[sleep]], and other [[health]] problems.<ref name="Goodman"/> In cases where an individual is considered unable to give informed refusal, another person ([[Legal guardian|guardian]]) may be authorized to give consent on their behalf.
The concept grew out of and is similar to that of [[informed consent]], but much less commonly used and applied. In the [[United States|United States of America]] it is recognized in certain [[state law]]s (in 2006: [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Vermont]], and [[Michigan]]) as well as in various [[court decision]]s.<ref name="Goodman"/>

As applied in the medical field, a physician has made an assessment of a patient and finds a specific test, intervention, or treatment is medically necessary. The patient refuses to consent to this recommendation. The physician then needs to explain the risks of not following through with the recommendations to allow the patient to make an informed decision against the recommendation. While in the past documentation of refusal of treatment has not been important, the widespread use of managed care, cost containment processes, as well as increased patient autonomy have created a situation where documented "informed refusal" is viewed as becoming more important<ref name="ACOG"/> When refusal of treatment may result in significant damage or death, the interaction needs to be  documented to protect the care giver in a potential later [[litigation]] against the allegation that the recommendation was either not made or not understood. On occasion, a patient will also refuse to sign the "informed refusal" document, in which case a witness would have to sign that the informed process and the refusal took place.<ref name="ACS"/> 

The pregnant patient represents a specific dilemma in the field of informed refusal as her action may result in harm or death to the fetus. Ethicists disagree on how to handle this situation.<ref name="DWB">{{cite journal| url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-8847.2006.00132.x |title=Rights of and duties to non-consenting patients - Informed refusal in the developing world| author=Louis-Jacques van Bogaert| journal=Developing World Bioethics | doi=10.1111/j.1471-8847.2006.00132.x| pmid=16436170| year=2006| volume=6| issue=1| pages=13–22}}</ref>
