"'''Death panel'''" is a political term that originated during a 2009 debate about federal health care legislation to cover the [[Uninsured in the United States#Uninsured demographic|uninsured in the United States]]. The term was first used in August 2009 by [[Sarah Palin]], the former Republican [[Governor of Alaska]], when she charged that the proposed legislation would create a "death panel" of bureaucrats who would decide whether Americans—such as her elderly parents or child with [[Down syndrome]]—were worthy of medical care. Palin's claim, however, was debunked, and it has been referred to as the "'''death panel myth'''"<ref name="Nyhan"/> as nothing in any proposed legislation would have led to individuals being judged to see if they were "worthy" of health care.<ref name="Not so"/> Palin specified that she was referring to [[HR 3200#Reimbursement for counseling about living wills|Section 1233 of bill HR 3200]] which would have paid physicians for providing voluntary counseling to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients about [[living wills]], [[advance directives]], and [[end-of-life care]] options.

Palin's claim was reported as false and criticized by mainstream [[news media]], [[fact-checker]]s, academics, physicians, Democrats, and some Republicans. Other prominent Republicans such as [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[conservative talk radio]] hosts  [[Glenn Beck]], [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Michelle Malkin]] backed Palin's statement. One poll showed that after it spread, about 85% of Americans were familiar with the charge and of those who were familiar with it, about 30% thought it was true.<ref name="Nyhan"/> Due to public concern, the provision to pay physicians for providing voluntary counseling was removed from [[America's Healthy Future Act|the Senate bill]] and was not included in the law that was enacted, the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. In a 2011 statement, the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] bemoaned the [[politicization]] of the issue and said that the proposal should be revisited.

For 2009, "death panel" was named as [[PolitiFact]]'s "Lie of the Year", one of [[FactCheck]]'s "whoppers", and the most outrageous term by the [[American Dialect Society]].

==Origins==

===Background===
[[File:Betsy McCaughey.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Betsy McCaughey]]
Palin's claim that "death panels" were included in the proposed health care legislation was preceded by comments of other conservatives who criticized the same section of the bill.

On July 16, 2009, former lieutenant governor of New York, [[Betsy McCaughey]], a longtime opponent of federal healthcare legislation<ref name="Rumor" /><ref name="distortions"/> said [[HR 3200#Reimbursement for counseling about living wills|Section 1233 of HR 3200]] was "a vicious assault on elderly people"<ref name="jugular" /> because it would "absolutely require" [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients to have counseling sessions every five years that would "tell them how to end their life sooner".<ref name="mccaughey claims"/> [[Conservative talk radio]] hosts including <ref name="Talk Radio Campaign"/> [[Rush Limbaugh]],<ref name="mccaughey claims"/> [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Laura Ingraham]] repeated McCaughey's claim.<ref name="epistemic"/> The [[AARP]], a non-profit lobby group for retired persons, responded that the sessions were in no way designed to encourage euthanasia, but would instead help seniors make better decisions and would help ensure that their wishes were followed.<ref name="mccaughey claims"/><ref name="fights fear"/> PolitiFact said the proposal provided Medicare coverage for optional counseling sessions for patients who wanted to learn more about end-of-life-planning.<ref name="mccaughey claims"/>

On July 24, 2009, an op-ed by McCaughey was published in the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name="deadly doctors"/> In the piece, which was titled "Deadly Doctors", McCaughey falsely asserted that presidential advisor [[Ezekiel Emanuel]] believed the disabled should not be entitled to medical care, and quoted him [[out of context]].<ref name="Resurface" /><ref name="bioethicist"/> On July 27, excerpts from the McCaughey's op-ed were read, with approval, by Representative (Rep.) [[Michele Bachmann]] (R-MN) on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref name="jugular" /><ref name="bioethicist"/> Within days, Rep. [[John Boehner]] (R-OH), then the Minority Leader of the House and Rep.[[Thaddeus McCotter]] (R-MI), the Republican Policy Committee Chairman, repeated claims that Section 1233 would encourage "government-sponsored" [[euthanasia]]<ref name="Talk Radio Campaign"/><ref name="ObamaReturns"/><ref name="False Euthanasia Claims"/> and Rep. [[Virginia Foxx]] (R-NC) charged that the proposal would "put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government."<ref name="LieOfTheYear"/><ref name="sterner action"/> On July 30, former Republican House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], declared that the House bill had "a bias toward euthanasia".<ref name="momentary lapse"/><ref name="rx"/> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported on August 1, 2009 that the claim had been spreading via "religious e-mail lists" and internet blogs.<ref name="Talk Radio Campaign"/> In early August, members of Congress held [[town hall meeting]]s that were marked by hostility—including shouting, sporadic, physical altercations and comparisons between the proposed reforms and [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name="debate turns"/>

===Palin's initial statement===
[[File:5.3.10SarahPalinByDavidShankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sarah Palin]]]]
[[Sarah Palin]], who had been keeping a low profile after her July 3, 2009, [[Resignation of Sarah Palin|resignation announcement as Alaska's Governor]],<ref name="LieOfTheYear"/><ref name="in brief"/> was the first to use the "death panel" term on August 7, 2009. In her first [[Facebook]] note, she said:<ref name="phobia"/><ref name="wish" /><ref name="in Progress"/>
{{quote|[G]overnment health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's "death panel" so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their "level of productivity in society," whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.<ref name="palin facebook coining"/>}}

Though Palin's post did not identify a portion of legislation she believed mandated "death panels",<ref name="Vs"/> a spokesperson pointed to HR 3200, Section 1233,<ref name="AUTOREF8" /><ref name="Palin claims Obama misled"/><ref name="ABCTapper" /> and Palin herself followed up in an August 12 Facebook note clarifying her argument by discussing Section 1233.<ref name="Vs"/> However, neither Section 1233 nor any other provision in any health care bill provided for a system to determine if individuals were worthy of health care.<ref name="Not so"/>

==Policy==
[[File:Earl Blumenauer.jpg|thumb|upright|Rep. [[Earl Blumenauer|Blumenauer]] (D-OR), sponsored the bill HR 3200.]]
Legislation providing for counseling patients on advance directives, living wills and end-of-life care had been on the books for years, however, the laws did not provide for physicians to be reimbursed for giving such counseling during routine physical exams of the elderly. The [[Patient Self-Determination Act]] (1991) requires health care providers, including hospitals, hospices and nursing homes to provide information about advance directives to admitted patients.<ref name="four small"/><ref name="panels or end"/> The [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] began providing reimbursements for end-of-life care discussions with [[terminally ill]] patients in 2003.<ref name="Maddow"/>

A bill to provide for reimbursement every five years for office visit discussions with Medicare patients on advance directives, living wills, and other end of life care issues was proposed by Rep. [[Earl Blumenauer]] (D-OR) in April 2009—with Republican cosponsors [[Charles Boustany]] (R-LA), a cardiovascular surgeon, [[Patrick Tiberi]] (R-OH), and [[Geoff Davis]] (R-KY).<ref name="pioneering program"/><ref name="Bipartisan"/><ref name="lie machine"/> The counseling was to be voluntary and could be reimbursed more often if a grave illness occurred. The legislation had been encouraged by [[Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center|Gundersen Lutheran]] and a loose coalition of other hospitals in La Crosse, Wisconsin that had had positive experiences with the widespread use of advance directives.<ref name="pioneering program"/><ref name="Bipartisan"/><ref name="AUTOREF9" /><ref name="talking"/> Blumenauer's standalone bill was tabled and inserted into the large health care reform bill, HR 3200 as Section 1233 shortly afterward.<ref name="pioneering program" /><ref name="reporter faces" /><ref name="Hypocrisy"/> Supporters of the Section 1233 counseling provision included the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), [[AARP]], the [[National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization]], and [[Consumers Union]]; the [[National Right to Life Committee]] opposed "the provision as written."<ref name="AP Fact Check"/> It was removed from the Senate version of the bill due to the death panel controversy<ref name="SenateCommittee"/> and was not included in the reconciled and final bill which became law in March 2010 and which is known as the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].<ref name="ObamaReturns"/>

In an interview published in June 2009, [[Donald Berwick]], administrator of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], said that "The question is not whether we are going to ration; the question is whether we are going to ration with our eyes open."<ref>[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/medimedia/bh_200906/index.php?startid=35#/40/OnePage Rethinking Comparative Effectiveness Research.] Interview with Donald Berwick. Biotechnology Healthcare Magazine June, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2799075/ National Center for Biotechnology Information] Biotechnology Interview Questions & Answers - Not PHP file as previous citation</ref>

In late December 2010, it was reported that a new Medicare regulation had been approved that would pay for end-of-life care consultations during annual physical exams. The regulation was to be effective January 1, 2011,<ref name="ObamaReturns"/> but was deleted on January 4 for political reasons.<ref name="Alters Rule"/>

==Reaction==
[[File:Protest banners with picture of Obama with Hitler mustache and a death panel sign.jpg|thumb|upright|Protesters referencing the phrase "death panel" at a [[Carol Shea-Porter#Town hall disruptions|town hall meeting]]]]
The "death panel" myth produced widespread reaction among academics, the media, physicians and politicians.

===Academics===

Princeton economics professor [[Uwe Reinhardt]] said that it is possible to slightly bend the U.S. health care cost curve down through a lower volume of health care services "by more widespread use of living wills—an idea once actively promoted by Newt Gingrich. But those ideas were met in the past year by dark allusions to 'rationing', to Nazi-style death panels and to 'killing Granny'."<ref name="The Perennial Quest"/><ref name="addendum"/> Reinhardt said lowering health care costs would require lowering health care incomes, and that such reforms always end up being a political [[Third rail (metaphor)|third rail]].<ref name="The Perennial Quest"/>

[[Brendan Nyhan]], a health care policy analyst and assistant professor at [[Dartmouth College]], wrote that "Obama’s plan might lead to more restrictive rationing than already occurs under the current health care system", but criticized Palin's statements as largely "unjustified and false".<ref name="Nyhan"/> Nyhan also said that labeling institutions "death panels" for denying "coverage at a system level for specific treatments or drugs" was an attempt to "move the goalposts of the debate."<ref name="continuing efforts"/>

Bioethicist [[George Annas]] wrote that America has a "death denying culture that cannot accept death as anything but defeat." We will "prepare for any and every disease and screen for every possible 'risk factor', but we are utterly unable to prepare for death." Annas commended and quoted ''Boston Globe'' columnist [[Ellen Goodman]], who wrote "I think that what our [healthcare] system may need is not more intervention, but more conversation, especially on the delicate subject of dying ... More expensive care is not always better care. Doing everything can be the wrong thing." However, Annas said mythical "death panels" blocked exploring these issues, appearing to affirm [[Ivan Illich]]'s 1975 ''[[Medical Nemesis]]'', when he said "&nbsp;'[s]ocially approved death happens when man [sic] has become useless not only as a producer but also as a consumer. It is at this point that [the patient] ... must be written off as a total loss'."<ref name=Annas/>

Health economist [[James C. Robinson (health economist)|James C. Robinson]] said the debate over "death panels" showed how willing the public was "to believe the worst about perceived governmental interference with individual choices."<ref name="comparative effectiveness"/> Historian [[Jill Lepore]] characterized "death panels" as a [[conspiracy theory]] that is believed by a minority of the U.S. population and is based on fears that the federal government is conspiring to kill off its weakest members. Of the reform effort, Lepore said it was an "unwelcome reminder of a dreaded truth: death comes to us all"; of the uproar, Lepore said it rallied a party base against death, and was a "savvy" tactic". Lepore also said Obama was "catastrophically outmaneuvered" by the spread of the death panel rumors.<ref name="politics of death"/> [[Johnathan Oberlander]], a professor of health policy, said the Obama administration was "seemingly unprepared for the intense opposition and fury that erupted during town-hall meetings in the summer of 2009."<ref name="Oberlander" /> Political scientist [[James Morone]] said the term death panel played a role in the Democrats' loss of control over the public debate because they did not address the "underlying fears of big government". Morone called the "death panel" arguments "pungent, memorable, simple, and effective."<ref name="Morone" />

Brent J. Pawlecki, a corporate medical director, said the phrases "death panels" and "killing Grandma" were "used to fuel the flames of fear and opposition".<ref name="AUTOREF10" /><ref name="AUTOREF11" /> [[Gail Wilensky]], a health adviser to President George H.W. Bush and John McCain who has overseen Medicare and Medicaid, said the charge was untrue and upsetting, adding that "[t]here are serious questions that are associated with policy aspects of the health care reform bills that we're seeing ... And there's frustration because so much of the discussion is around issues like the death panels and [Ezekiel Emanuel] that I think are [[red herring]]s at best."<ref name="LieOfTheYear" /><ref name="NeedForSeriousDebate"/> [[Susan Dentzer]], editor of ''[[Health Affairs]]'', said Congress' approval of $1.1&nbsp;billion for [[Comparative Effectiveness|comparative effectiveness research]] in the [[2009 stimulus]] contributed to fear the research would "lead to government rationing" which "fueled the 'death panels' fury of summer 2009."<ref name="coherent health"/>

===Media===

''[[The Economist]]'' said the phrase was used as an "outrageous allegation" to confront politicians at [[town hall meetings]] during the August 2009 congressional recess.<ref name="AUTOREF12" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the term became a standard slogan among many conservatives opposed to the Obama administration’s health care overhaul.<ref name="wish"/> Former ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor [[Jon Meacham]] said it was "a lie crafted to foment opposition to the president's push for reform"<ref name="teenage panelist"/> and [[Fox News]] analyst [[Juan Williams]] said "of course there is no such thing as any death panel."<ref name="juan"/> The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that some Republicans used the term as a "jumping-off point" to discuss government rationing of health care services, while some liberal groups applied the term to private health insurance companies.<ref name="AUTOREF18" /> Journalist Paul Waldman of ''[[The American Prospect]]'' called the "death panel" charge a consequential policy lie, a falsehood about a policy that had definite effects on the policy, a type of lie that is not as condemned in the media as personal lies.<ref name="PoliticalLies" />

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' noted that some critics of the U.S. reform used the United Kingdom's [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE)—"as an example of [doing] the sort of drug rationing that amounted to a 'death panel'". NICE, as one of its functions, uses [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] to determine whether new treatments and drugs should be available to those covered by Britain's [[National Health Service]].<ref name="US breast cancer"/> ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' wrote that Sarah Palin's use of the "death panels" term was a reference to NICE.<ref name="sunday times"/>

===Physicians===
C. Porter Storey Jr. said the term represents fear that due to financial pressure "some mechanical, governmental method will be used to determine how much of our scarce health care resources will be applied to their situation."<ref name="AUTOREF14" /> [[Atul Gawande]], a surgeon and writer, said that fear of missing out on an expensive life-extending treatment is behind the phrase, but he thought that framing the issue in this way was completely mistaken. "[T]he trouble is not whether we're going to offer a $100,000 drug to help someone get 3 or 4 months"; our big trouble is that patients receive a $100,000 drug that not only yields no benefit—it also causes major side effects that shortens their lives", he said.<ref name="youtube"/> Gawande said doctor's schedules of 20 minute appointments, a lack of payments and the emotional difficulty of conversations about mortality were barriers to the doctor-patient discussions about end-of-life care issues, which can take about an hour.<ref name="youtube1"/>

Geriatric psychiatrist [[Paul Kettl]] said his experience in a geriatric unit showed end-of-life discussions and reimbursements were "desperately needed" as these hour long conversations are "ignored in the crush of medication and disease management."<ref name="Vote"/> In the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', Kettl wrote he was in favor of the "death panels that were originally proposed ... periodic discussions about advance directives that Medicare would pay for as medical visits."<ref name="Vote"/> Kettl noted that the attention-catching phrase "death panels" became "a lightning rod for objections to a series of ideas about health care besides" end-of-life discussions, and that somehow, "the concept of physicians being paid for time to talk with patients and their families about [[advance directive]]s ... generated into the fear of decisions about life and death being controlled by the government."<ref name="Vote"/> Kettl also wrote that, "We can expect more good medical ideas to be destroyed by sound bytes and needless concerns that will be exaggerated. It makes for good television, but bad medicine."<ref name="Vote"/>

The [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] (ASCO) published a statement in January 2011 advocating an individualized approach to treatment and supportive care for patients with advanced cancer. They said there was a {{quotation|need to recognize the value of these conversations to both our patients and society and the effort such care requires in our reimbursement systems. Currently, our system highly incentivizes delivery of cancer-directed interventions (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and so on) over conversations that are critical to establishing a patient’s goals and preferences and providing individualized care. Efforts to compensate oncologists and others for delivering this important aspect of cancer care were unfortunately politicized in the recent health care reform debates, but these efforts had at their core a critical patient-centered societal interest and should be revisited.<ref name="statement"/>}}

Benjamin W. Corn, a cancer specialist, wrote in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' that the "death panels" controversy showed Americans were uneasy discussing topics related to the dying process. Corn said the end-of-life care conversations can have an important positive effect on patients, although some patients may not ever welcome them. Corn also said that certain issues, such as whether experimental therapies should be reimbursed, the possible expansion of hospices, restoring dignity to the process of dying, and guidelines for physician assisted suicide, need to be addressed directly.<ref name="phobia"/> David Kibbe, a physician, and Brian Klepper, a health care analyst and consultant, wrote, "One of American politics' most disingenuous conceits is that health care must cost what we currently pay. Another is that the only way to make it cost less is to deny care. It has been in industry executives' financial interests to perpetuate these myths".<ref>Brian Klepper and David Kibbe (August 1, 2011).

===Politicians===

Sen. [[Lisa Murkowski]] (R-AK) stated that "death panels" were a baseless charge that unnecessarily incited fear and detracted from real problems in the proposed legislation. She said the proposed legislation was "bad enough that we don't need to be making things up."<ref name="Bad Enough"/> Sen. [[Johnny Isakson]] (R-GA), thought there was illogical confusion over "death panels"; he said advance directives put "authority in the individual rather than the government."<ref name="euthanize grandmother"/> In July 2010 Rep. [[Bob Inglis]], (R-SC) said that he thought it was counterproductive for the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] movement for some to promote misinformation about death panels when they do not exist.<ref name="AUTOREF17" /> Rep. [[Darrell Issa]] (R-CA) endorsed Rep. [[Charles Boustany]]'s statement that "medical panels of people who care about what's best for their patients ... is good science and good medicine."<ref name="Costly medical devices"/> Speaking for himself, Issa said "Republicans have to step back from the words 'death panels'."<ref name="Costly medical devices"/> Michael F. Cannon, a former domestic policy analyst for the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee and a member of the [[Cato Institute]], wrote that "[p]aying doctors to help seniors sort out their preferences for end-of-life care is consumer-directed rationing, not bureaucratic rationing."<ref name="AUTOREF20" />

President Barack Obama cited the charge—along with the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|citizenship conspiracy theories]] and "job-killing" allegations—as [[demagogy]] against him.<ref name="hip hip"/> In testimony before the [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction]], [[Erskine Bowles]] (D), co-chair of the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]], called "death panels" "a kind of crazy stuff" and added that end-of-life care in the U.S. needed reform.<ref name="short take"/>
Rep. [[Earl Blumenauer]] (D-OR) called the references to "death panels" or euthanasia "mind-numbing" and "a terrible falsehood".<ref name="stands by"/> He thought that the news media contributed to the persistence of the myth by amplifying misinformation and extreme behavior.<ref name="My Near"/> When a regulation for reimbursing consultation payments was upcoming, Blumenauer cautioned supporters to keep things quiet, reasoning that Republican leaders would attempt to continue the myth.<ref name="ObamaReturns"/>

===Palin response===

On August 12, Palin said "the elderly and ailing would be coerced into accepting minimal end-of-life care to reduce health care costs".<ref name="Palin claims Obama misled"/><ref name="stands by"/>
On August 12 Palin charged on Twitter that Britain's [[National Health Service]] (NHS) was an evil "death panel", leading to so many replies from British citizens defending the NHS that Twitter crashed.<ref name="Tweetment"/> Disabled professor [[Stephen Hawking]] led the responses, saying "I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for the NHS."<ref name="Tweetment">{{cite news |title=Palin's NHS Tweetment |author=John Coles |newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |date=August 13, 2009 |url= }}</ref>

In a September 2009 speech, Palin said the term was "intended to sound a warning about the rationing that is sure to follow if big government tries to simultaneously increase health care coverage while also claiming to decrease costs."<ref name="excerpts of" /> In November 2009 Palin said that Obama was "incorrect" and "disingenuous" when he called the "death panel" charge "a lie, plain and simple."<ref name="I want to play" /> In the ''[[National Review]]'' she said <blockquote>"[t]o me, while reading that Section of the bill, it became so evident that there would be a panel of bureaucrats who would decide on levels of health care, decide on those who are worthy or not worthy of receiving some government-controlled coverage ... Since health care would have to be rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm for many individuals not able to receive the government care. That leads, of course, to death."<ref name="LieOfTheYear" /><ref name="Lowry" /></blockquote>

She explained that the term should not be taken literally, likening it to when President [[Ronald Reagan]] called the Soviet Union, the "[[Evil Empire]]."<ref name="Lowry" /> "He got his point across. He got people thinking and researching what he was talking about. It was quite effective. Same thing with the 'death panels'.<ref name="Lowry" /> ''[[Media Matters]]'' stated that Palin's claim of "death panels" was "simply false, regardless of whether she meant it literally or figuratively."<ref name="MM">Eric Schroeck [http://mediamatters.org/blog/201102030012 Taranto Offers Up Weak Defense Of Palin's "Death Panel" Lie] ''[[Media Matters]]'' February 3, 2011.</ref>

In December 2009 Palin warned on Twitter that a merged health care bill could have the "death panels" restored.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sarah Palin: 'Death panels' may be in final healthcare reform bill |author=Jordan Fabian |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=December 22, 2009 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/73371-palin-death-panels-may-be-in-final-health-bill |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}</ref> In October 2010, Palin defended her use of the term in a [[Newsmax.com]] interview. Palin said she <blockquote>"... spoke a lot about the rationing of care that was going to be a part of Obamacare, and, you know, I was about laughed out of town for bringing to light what I call death panels, because there's going to be faceless bureaucrats who will—based on cost analysis and some subjective idea on somebody's level of productivity in life—somebody is going to call the shots as to whether your loved one will be able to receive health care or not. To me, death panel. I called it like I saw it, and people didn't like it."<ref name="Good" /></blockquote>

Palin used the term jokingly while speaking at the 2009 [[Gridiron Club]] dinner for journalists, saying it was like being in front of a "death panel".<ref name="AUTOREF31" />

===Supporters===

[[File:Newt Gingrich by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Newt Gingrich]]]]
After Palin's statement, conservative commentators including [[Glenn Beck]], [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Michelle Malkin]] agreed that death panels were mandated by the proposed legislation.<ref name="Nyhan"/><ref name=malkin/><ref name="bloggers debate"/> On August 9, former House speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] backed Palin's "death panel" charge by saying that the bill created numerous agencies and panels, that government was not to be trusted, and "there clearly are people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards".<ref name="Not so"/><ref name="this week"/><ref name="Journalists left out"/> One week later, Gingrich wrote that the proposed legislation did not provide for government rationing of health care, but it was "all but certain to lead to rationing."<ref name="Newt"/>

At an August 12, 2009 town hall meeting, Senator [[Chuck Grassley]], the ranking Republican on the Health Care subcommittee said, "living wills ... ought to be done within the family.<ref name="Maddow" /> We should not have a government program that determines you're going to pull the plug on Grandma."<ref name="LieOfTheYear" /> Grassley later said that he did not think the provision would grant the government the authority to decide who lives and dies.<ref name="grassley is the talk"/><ref name="episode"/><ref name="gregg's concerns"/>

===Political===
Consultation payments were removed from the Senate version of the bill by the [[Senate Finance Committee]].<ref name="SenateCommittee">{{cite news |title=Senate committee scraps healthcare provision that gave rise to 'death panel' claims; Though the claims are widely discredited, the Senate Finance Committee is withdrawing from its bill the inclusion of advance care planning consultations, calling them too confusing |authors=Christi Parsons and Andrew Zajac |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=August 14, 2009 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/14/nation/na-health-end-of-life14}}</ref> ''TIME'' wrote that "a single phrase—'death panels'—nearly derailed health care reform".<ref name="AUTOREF23" /> ''The Washington Post'' wrote that "President Obama's health-care initiative was nearly consumed by the furor" over the end-of-life care provision that would allow physician reimbursement for counseling.<ref name="pioneering program"/>

By mid-August 2009, about a week after Palin's initial Facebook note, the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that 86% of Americans had heard of the "death panels" charge.<ref name="Nyhan"/> Out of those who had heard the charge, 30% of people thought it was true while 20% did not know.<ref name="Nyhan"/> For Republicans, 47% thought it was true while 23% did not know.<ref name="Nyhan"/> Oberlander said the false warnings of a "government takeover" and "death panels" from Republicans drowned out the "Democrats' focus group–tested mantra of 'quality, affordable health care'&nbsp;"<!--quality, affordable health care" does not end the sentence-->.<ref name="Oberlander" /> Morone said the White House was not able to offer a "persuasive narrative to counter the Tea Party percussion", and "struggled to recapture public attention", contributing to Republican [[Scott Brown]]'s election.<ref name="Morone"/> The election of Brown in the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|special Senate election in Massachusetts]] was a surprise victory for Republicans<ref>{{cite news |title=Candidate's Fighting Words Draw G.O.P.'s Fire |author=Abby Goodnough |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 18, 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/us/politics/elizabeth-warrens-fighting-words-draw-gops-fire.html}}</ref> and a setback for the chance of health care reform under Democratic leadership; Brown won the historical Senate seat of the late Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]], ending the Democrat's [[supermajority]] of 60 in the Senate.

In September 2010, six months after the passage of the [[Affordable Care Act]], a ''[[BBC]]'' article stated that among the "sticky charges" that had stuck against the bill was the false charge of "government 'death panels' deciding who can get what sort of care".<ref name="AUTOREF24" /> A survey by the [[Regence Foundation]] and ''[[National Journal]]'' released in 2011 showed 40% of Americans knew that the "death panels" were not in the Affordable Care Act, while 23% said they thought the law allowed government to make end-of-life care decisions on behalf of seniors, and 36% said they did not know.<ref name="Americans Can Handle"/>

Other findings from the survey included:
* 78% thought palliative care and end-of-life issues should be in the public discourse;
* 93% thought those decisions should be a top priority in the U.S. health care system;
* 70% agreed with the idea that "It is more important to enhance the quality of life for seriously ill patients, even if it means a shorter life" while 23% placed more importance on extending life through any possible medical treatment;
* Doctors, family, and friends were highly trusted sources for end-of-life care information while only 33% trusted elected officials or political candidates for accurate information.<ref name="Americans Can Handle"/>

[[Atul Gawande]], a physician who writes on health care topics for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', said "that the whole death panel reduction and reaction to it" temporarily "shut down our ability to even have a national discussion about how to have the right [end-of-life] conversation" between doctors and patients.<ref name="Gawande">{{cite news |title=Dr. Gawande on End-of-Life Issues, 'Death Panels' |newspaper=[[On Point]] |date=January 5, 2011 |url=http://onpoint.wbur.org/2011/01/05/gawande-life-death-panel}}</ref>

==Media analysis==
Megan Garber of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' called the topic "irresistible" to reporters because it covered conflict, drama, innuendo, and Sarah Palin.<ref name="CJR"/> Garber said it was "notoriously challenging for the press to deal with" because the old method of delegitimization—ignoring—was no longer workable.<ref name="CJR">{{cite news |title=Health Care and Wikipedia |author=Megan Garber |newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=August 18, 2009 |url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/health_care_and_wikipedia.php |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref> "Debunking rumors without simultaneously sanctioning them has always been a fraught endeavor, with the proliferation of niche media sites over the past several years only rendering that effort even more precarious," said Garber.<ref name="CJR"/>

A study by Regina G. Lawrence, a communications professor, and Matthew L. Schafer, a [[Juris Doctor]] candidate, found that "the mainstream news, particularly newspapers, debunked 'death panels' early, fairly often", however, some journalists presented information in a he said/she said style, often confusing readers, and most did not include an explanation as to why the charge was false.<ref name="TwoYearsLater">{{cite web |url=http://lippmannwouldroll.com/2011/05/23/two-years-later-the-media-response-to-death-panels-and-why-its-still-important/ |title=Two Years Later: The Media Response to Death Panels and Why It’s Still Important |author=Matthew L. Schafer and Regina G. Lawrence |date=May 23, 2011 |work=lippmann would roll |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> Lawrence and Schafer said that "the dilemma for reporters playing by the rules of procedural objectivity is that repeating a claim reinforces a sense of its validity—or at least, enshrines its place as an important topic of public debate. Moreover, there is no clear evidence that journalism can correct misinformation once it has been widely publicized. Indeed, it didn't seem to correct the death panels misinformation in our study."<ref name="TwoYearsLater"/>

In his study of the "death panel" myth, Brendan Nyhan concluded that "once such beliefs take hold, few good options exist to counter them". However, in future such cases he recommended that "concerned scholars, citizens, and journalists ... [could] create negative publicity for the elites who are promoting misinformation", and "pressure the media to stop providing coverage to serial dissemblers."<ref name="Nyhan"/> In contrast to the above statements suggesting there is no good method to correct misinformation in the minds of the public, MIT professor [[Adam Berinsky]] has found some success when people are exposed to corrective information from sources that belong to the same political party as the misinformer.<ref name="Berinsky">[[Adam Berinsky]] (June 14, 2011).
