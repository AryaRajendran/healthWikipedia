'''Ancient Greek medicine''' revolved around the theory of [[humours]].  The most important figure in ancient Greek medicine is the physician [[Hippocrates]], known as the "Father of Medicine", who established his own medical school at [[Kos|Cos]].<ref>Atlas of Anatomy, ed. Giunti Editorial Group, Taj Books LTD 2002, p. 9</ref>  Hippocrates and his students documented many conditions in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], and developed the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, still in use today.   The writings of Hippocrates, and others, like Socrates, had a lasting influence on [[Islamic medicine]] and [[Medieval medicine|Medieval European medicine]] until many of their findings eventually became obsolete from the 14th century onwards.

Early influences
The first known Greek medical school opened in Cnidus in 700 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]], author of the first anatomical work, worked at this school, and it was here that the practice of observing patients was established. Despite their known respect for Egyptian medicine, attempts to discern any particular influence on Greek practice at this early  time have not been dramatically successful because of the lack of sources and the challenge of understanding ancient [[medical terminology]].  It is clear, however, that the Greeks imported Egyptian substances into their [[pharmacopoeia]], and the influence became more pronounced after the establishment of a school of Greek medicine in [[Alexandria]].<ref>Heinrich Von Staden, ''Herophilus: The Art of Medicine in Early Alexandria'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), pp. 1-26.</ref>

==Hippocrates and Hippocratic medicine==
[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Hippocratic Corpus]]'', a collection of around seventy early Greek medical works associated with Hippocrates and his teachings]]

A towering figure in the history of medicine was the physician [[Hippocrates]] of [[Kos]] (ca. 460 BC&nbsp;– ca. 370 BC), considered the "father of modern medicine."<ref>[http://www.medicinaantiqua.org.uk/sa_hippint.html Hippocrates: The "Greek Miracle" in Medicine]</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228084033/http://www.geocities.com/trepanationz/hippocrates/ The Father of Modern Medicine: Hippocrates]</ref>  The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] is a collection of around seventy early medical works from ancient Greece strongly associated with Hippocrates and his students.  Most famously, Hippocrates invented the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today.

The existence of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] implies that this "Hippocratic" medicine was practiced by a group of professional physicians bound (at least among themselves) by a strict ethical code.  Aspiring students normally paid a fee for training (a provision is made for exceptions) and entered into a virtual family relationship with his teacher.  This training included some oral instruction and probably hands-on experience as the teacher's assistant, since the Oath assumes that the student will be interacting  with patients.  The Oath also places limits on what the physician may or may not do ("To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug") and intriguingly hints at the existence of another class of professional specialists, perhaps akin to surgeons ("I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners, specialists in this art").<ref>Owsei Temkin, "What Does the Hippocratic Oath Say?", in ''"On Second Thought" and Other Essays in the History of Medicine'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), pp. 21-28.</ref>

[[Hippocrates]] and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. He is given credit for the first purple description of [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers, an important diagnostic sign in chronic suppurative lung disease, [[lung cancer]] and [[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic heart disease]]. For this reason, clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as "Hippocratic fingers".<ref name=schwartz>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|Richards|Goyal|2006}}</ref> Hippocrates was also the first physician to describe [[Hippocratic face]] in ''Prognosis''. [[Shakespeare]] famously alludes to this description when writing of [[Falstaff]]'s death in Act II, Scene iii. of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<ref name=sing40>{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=40}}</ref><ref name=margotta70>{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=70}}</ref>

Hippocrates began to categorize illnesses as [[Acute (medical)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and [[epidemic]], and use terms such as, "exacerbation, [[relapse]], resolution, crisis, [[paroxysm]], peak, and [[convalescence]]."<ref name=garrison97>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}}</ref><ref name=mart90>{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|p=90}}</ref> Another of Hippocrates's major contributions may be found in his descriptions of the symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of [[Empyema|thoracic empyema]], i.e. [[suppuration]] of the lining of the chest cavity and hair loss and baldness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.healthyhairhighlights.com/hair_loss_and_hair_growth_in_bible.html|title=Hippocrates father of medicine solution of hair loss and baldness|publisher=Healthy Hair Highlights News|date=22 August 2011 | accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> His teachings remain relevant to present-day students of [[Pulmonology|pulmonary medicine]] and surgery.<ref name = major/> Hippocrates was the first documented [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|chest surgeon]] and his findings are still valid.<ref name=major>{{Harvnb|Major|1965}}</ref>
The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] contains the core medical texts of this school.  Although once thought to have been written by Hippocrates himself, today, many scholars believe that these texts were written by a series of authors over several decades.<ref>Vivian Nutton'Ancient Medicine'(Routledge 2004)</ref>  Since it is impossible to determine which may have been written by Hippocrates himself, it is difficult to know which Hippocratic doctrines originated with him.

==Asclepieia==
[[File:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|thumb|View of the ''Askleipion'' of [[Kos]], the best preserved instance of an Asklepieion.]]
Temples dedicated to the healer-god [[Asclepius]], known as ''Asclepieia'' ({{lang-el|Ασκληπιεία}}, sing. ''Asclepieion'' ''Ασκληπιείον''), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.<ref name="books.google.com">Risse, G.B. ''Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals.''

==Aristotle==
[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] was the most influential scholar of the living world from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Though his early natural philosophy work was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings demonstrate great concern for [[empiricism]], biological causation, and the diversity of life.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 41</ref> Aristotle did not experiment, however, holding that items display their real natures in their own environments, rather than controlled artificial ones. While in modern-day physics and chemistry this assumption has been found unhelpful, in zoology and ethology it remains the dominant practice, and Aristotle's work "retains real interest".<ref>Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 247</ref> He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and [[Abstraction|attributes]] of plants and animals in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to [[categorization|categorizing]]. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50.

Aristotle believed that [[formal cause]]s guided all natural processes.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 84-90, 135; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 41-44</ref> Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design; for example suggesting that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and generally  giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man—the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]].<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201-202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''</ref>

He held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not foreordained by that form. Yet another aspect of his biology divided souls into three groups: a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth; a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation; and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection. He attributed only the first to plants, the first two to animals, and all three to humans.<ref>Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3</ref> Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, and like the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45</ref> Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].<ref>Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348</ref> Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany—the ''[[Historia Plantarum|History of Plants]]''—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel. Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46</ref> The biological/teleological ideas of Aristotle and Theophrastus, as well as their emphasis on a series of axioms rather than on empirical observation, cannot be easily separated from their consequent impact on Western medicine.

==Alexandria==
[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[Historia Plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 200 BC]]
Following Theophrastus ( d.286 BC ), the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.<ref>Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252</ref> It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found. The first medical teacher at Alexandria was [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], who differed from Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not. He did this using an experiment involving cutting certain veins and arteries in a pig's neck until the squealing stopped.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56</ref> In the same vein (no pun intended), he developed a [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] technique which relied upon distinguishing different types of pulse.<ref>Barnes, ''Hellenistic Philosophy and Science'' pp 383</ref> He, and his contemporary, [[Erasistratus|Erasistratus of Chios]], researched the role of veins and [[nerve]]s, mapping their courses across the body.

Erasistratus connected the increased complexity of the surface of the human brain compared to other animals to its superior [[intelligence]]. He sometimes employed [[experiment]]s to further his research, at one time repeatedly weighing a caged bird and noting its weight loss between feeding times. Following his teacher's researches into [[pneumatics]], he claimed that the human system of [[blood vessel]]s was controlled by [[vacuum]]s, drawing blood across the body. In [[Erasistratus]]' physiology, air enters the body, is then drawn by the lungs into the heart, where it is transformed into vital spirit, and is then pumped by the arteries throughout the body. Some of this vital spirit reaches the [[brain]], where it is transformed into animal spirit, which is then distributed by the nerves.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 57</ref> Herophilus and Erasistratus performed their experiments upon criminals given to them by their Ptolemaic kings. They [[Vivisection|dissected these criminals alive]], and "while they were still breathing they observed parts which nature had formerly concealed, and examined their position, colour, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, connection."<ref>Barnes, ''Hellenistic Philosophy and Science'', pp 383-384</ref>

Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. In the words of [[Ernst Mayr]], "Nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance."<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-94; quotation from p 91</ref> Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.<ref>Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252</ref>

==Dioscorides==
The first century AD Greek physician, pharmacologist, botanist, and Roman army surgeon [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] authored an encyclopedia of medicinal substances commonly known as ''De Materia Medica.'' This work did not delve into medical theory or explanation of pathogenesis, but described the uses and actions of some 600 substances, based on empirical observation. Unlike other works of Classical antiquity, Dioscorides' manuscript was never out of publication and his [[materia medica]] formed the basis for the Western pharmacopeia through the 19th century, a true testament to the efficacy of the medicines described ; moreover, the influence of this work on European [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] eclipsed that of the Hippocratic Corpus.<ref>De Vos (2010) "European Materia Medica in Historical Texts: Longevity of a Tradition and Implications for Future Use", ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' 132(1): 28-47</ref>

==Historical legacy==
Through long contact with Greek culture, and their eventual conquest of Greece, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] absorbed many of the Greek ideas on medicine.  Early Roman reactions to Greek medicine ranged from enthusiasm to hostility, but eventually the Romans adopted a favorable view of Hippocratic medicine.<ref>von Staden, "Liminal Perils: Early Roman Receptions of Greek Medicine", in ''Tradition, Transmission, Transformation'', ed. F. Jamil Ragep and Sally P. Ragep with Steven Livesey (Leiden: Brill, 1996), pp. 369-418.</ref>

This acceptance led to the spread of Greek medical theories throughout the Roman Empire, and thus a large portion of the West.  The most influential Roman scholar to continue and expand on the Hippocratic tradition was [[Galen]] (d. c. 207). Study of Hippocratic and Galenic texts, however, all but disappeared in the Latin West in the [[Early Middle Ages]], following the collapse of the Western Empire, although the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition of Greek medicine continued to be studied and practiced in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium). After AD 750, Arab, Persian and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusi]] scholars translated Galen's and Dioscorides' works in particular translated. Thereafter the Hippocratic-Galenic medical tradition was assimilated and eventually expanded, with the most influential Muslim doctor-scholar being [[Avicenna|(Ibn Sina)]]. Beginning in the late eleventh century, the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition returned to the Latin West with a series of translations of the Classical texts, mainly from Arabic translations but occasionally from the original Greek. In the Renaissance, more translations of Galen and Hippocrates directly from the Greek were made from newly available Byzantine manuscripts.  

Galen's influence was so great that even after Western Europeans started making dissections in the thirteenth century, scholars often assimilated findings into the Galenic model that otherwise might have thrown Galen's accuracy into doubt.  Over time, however, Classical medical theory came to be superseded by increasing emphasis on scientific experimental methods in the 16th and 17th centuries. Nevertheless, the Hippocratic-Galenic practice of bloodletting was practiced into the 19th century, despite its empirical ineffectiveness and riskiness.
