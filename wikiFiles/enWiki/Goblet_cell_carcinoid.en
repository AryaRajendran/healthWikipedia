The '''[[goblet cell]] [[carcinoid]]''', abbreviated '''GCC''' and also known as '''crypt cell carcinoma''' and '''[[neuroendocrine tumour]] with goblet cell differentiation''', is a rare [[biphasic]] [[gastrointestinal tract]] [[tumour]] that consists of a neuroendocrine component and a conventional [[carcinoma]].<ref name=pmid18042066>{{cite journal |author=van Eeden S, Offerhaus GJ, Hart AA, ''et al.'' |title=Goblet cell carcinoid of the appendix: a specific type of carcinoma |journal=Histopathology |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=763â€“73 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18042066 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2559.2007.02883.x |url=}}</ref>

==Sign and symptoms==
GCCs may present as [[appendicitis]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Goblet_cell_carcinoid_-_very_low_mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a goblet cell carcinoid. [[H&E stain]].]]
GCCs are diagnosed by [[pathology]].  They have a characteristic biphasic appearance which includes (1) goblet cell-like cells, and (2) neuroendocrine-type nuclear [[chromatin]] ([[stippled chromatin]]).

==Prognosis==
GCCs have an aggressive course vis-a-vis other appendiceal neuroendocrine tumours.<ref name=pmid18042066/>

==Treatment==
GCCs are treated with surgery.
