The '''blood sugar concentration''' or '''blood glucose level''' is the amount of [[glucose]] (sugar) present in the [[blood]] of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly [[blood sugar regulation|regulates blood glucose levels]] as a part of metabolic [[homeostasis]].

Glucose is the primary [[food energy|source of energy]] for the body's cells, and blood [[lipid]]s (in the form of [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s) are primarily a compact energy store. (There are exceptions.  For example, because their dietary metabolizable carbohydrates tend to be used by rumen organisms,<ref>Van Soest, P. J. (1994). ''Nutritional ecology of the ruminant''. 2nd Ed.  Cornell Univ. Press, ISBN 080142772X.</ref> ruminants tend to be continuously gluconeogenic;<ref>{{cite journal|author=Young, J. W.|pmid=320235|year=1977|title=Gluconeogenesis in cattle: Significance and methodology|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(77)83821-6|journal=Journal of dairy science}}</ref> consequently their hepatocytes must rely on such primary energy sources as volatile fatty acids, absorbed from the rumen, rather than glucose.) Glucose is transported from the intestines or [[liver]] to body cells via the bloodstream, and is made available for cell absorption via the hormone [[insulin]], produced by the body primarily in the [[pancreas]].

The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5&nbsp;mM (5.5&nbsp;mmol/L or 100&nbsp;mg/dL, i.e. milligrams/deciliter);<ref name=convert>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part1/section-9.html What are mg/dl and mmol/l? How to convert? Glucose? Cholesterol?] Advameg, Inc.</ref> however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. Glucose levels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day (termed "the fasting level"), and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few millimolar. The normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Blood sugar levels for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 125 mg/dL. <ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003482.htm Glucose test - blood]. NIH – National Institutes of Health.</ref> The blood glucose target range for diabetics, according to the American Diabetes Association, should be 70–130 (mg/dL) before meals, and less than 180&nbsp;mg/dL after meals (as measured by a blood glucose monitor).<ref>Davidson, Nancy Klobassa and Moreland, Peggy (July 26, 2011) [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-glucose-target-range/MY00494 Living with diabetes blog]. mayoclinic.com.</ref>

Blood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition. A persistently high level is referred to as [[hyperglycemia]]; low levels are referred to as [[hypoglycemia]]. [[Diabetes mellitus]] is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes, and is the most prominent disease related to failure of blood sugar regulation. Intake of [[alcohol]] causes an initial surge in blood sugar, and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also, certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels.<ref>Rosemary Walker & Jill Rodgers ''Type 2 Diabetes – Your Questions Answered'', Dorling Kindersley, 2006, ISBN 1-74033-550-3.</ref>

==Units==
The international standard way of measuring blood glucose levels are in terms of a [[molar concentration]], measured in [[mmol]]/L (millimoles per litre; or [[molar concentration|millimolar]], abbreviated mM). In the [[United States]], [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]] is measured in [[mg/dL]] (milligrams per decilitre).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110706100159/http://www.abbottdiabetescare.com.au/diabetes-faq-measure-units.php Diabetes FAQs – Blood Glucose Measurement Units – Abbott Diabetes Care]</ref>

Since the molecular weight of glucose C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is about 180&nbsp;g/mol, for the measurement of glucose, the difference between the two scales is a factor of 18, so that 1&nbsp;mmol/L of glucose is equivalent to 18&nbsp;mg/dL.<ref name=convert/>

==Normal values in humans==
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Reference Values are: 1mmol/L = 18mg/dL (Merck Manual)
Many factors affect a person's blood sugar level. A body's [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanism, when operating normally, restores the blood sugar level to a narrow range of about 4.4 to 6.1&nbsp;[[mmol]]/L (79.2 to 110&nbsp;mg/dL) (as measured by a fasting blood glucose test).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journal.diabetes.org/clinicaldiabetes/v18n22000/pg69.htm |title=Screening for Type 2 Diabetes|journal= Clinical Diabetes|volume=18 |issue=2|year= 2000}}</ref>

Despite widely variable intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial [[carbohydrate]] load, human blood glucose levels tend to remain within the normal range. However, shortly after eating, the blood glucose level may rise, in non-diabetics, temporarily up to 7.8&nbsp;mmol/L (140&nbsp;mg/dL)  or a bit more.  The [[American Diabetes Association]] recommends a post-meal glucose level of less than 10&nbsp;[[mmol]]/L (180&nbsp;mg/dL) and a fasting plasma glucose of 5 to 7.2&nbsp;[[mmol]]/L (90–130&nbsp;mg/dL).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/suppl_1/s4.full|author=American Diabetes Association|title= January 2006 Diabetes Care|volume=29 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages= 51–580|quote=Standards of Medical Care-Table 6 and Table 7, Correlation between A1C level and Mean Plasma Glucose Levels on Multiple Testing over 2–3 months|pmid=16373931|year=2006|journal=Diabetes Care}}</ref>

The actual amount of glucose in the blood and body fluids is very small.  In a healthy adult male of 75&nbsp;kg with a [[blood]] volume of 5 liters, a blood glucose level of 5.5&nbsp;mmol/L (100&nbsp;mg/dL) amounts to 5 grams, slightly less than two typical American restaurant [[sugar packet]]s for [[coffee]] or [[tea]].<ref>USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 22 (2009)</ref> Part of the reason why this amount is so small is that, to maintain an influx of glucose into cells, enzymes modify glucose by adding [[phosphate]] or other groups to it.

==Animals==

In general, ranges of blood sugar in common domestic ruminants are lower than in many monogastric mammals.<ref>Eiler, H. (2004) "Endocrine glands", pp. 621–669 in Reese, W. O. (ed.). ''Dukes' Physiology of Domestic Animals''. 12th ed.</ref>   However this generalization does not extend to wild ruminants or camelids.  For serum glucose in mg/dL, reference ranges of 42 to 75 for cows, 44 to 81 for sheep, and 48 to 76 for goats, but 61 to 124 for cats; 62 to 108 for dogs, 62 to 114 for horses, 66 to 116 for pigs, 75 to 155 for rabbits, and 90 to 140 for llamas have been reported.<ref>Kahn, C.

==Regulation==<!--Blood sugar regulation redirects here-->
{{Main|Blood sugar regulation}}

The body's [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanism keeps blood glucose levels within a narrow range. It is composed of several interacting systems, of which hormone regulation is the most important.

There are two types of mutually antagonistic metabolic hormones affecting blood glucose levels:
* [[catabolic]] hormones (such as [[glucagon]], [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamines]]) which increase blood glucose;
* and one [[anabolic]] hormone ([[insulin]]), which decreases blood glucose.

==Abnormality in blood sugar levels==

===High blood sugar===
{{main|hyperglycemia}}

If blood sugar levels remain too high the body suppresses appetite over the short term. Long-term [[hyperglycemia]] causes many of the long-term health problems including heart disease, eye, kidney, and nerve damage.

The most common cause of hyperglycemia is [[diabetes]]. When diabetes is the cause, physicians typically recommend an [[anti-diabetic medication]] as treatment. From the perspective the majority of patients, treatment with an old, well-understood diabetes drug such as [[metformin]] will be the safest, most effective, least expensive, most comfortable route to managing the condition.<ref name="BBDdiabetesM2">{{Cite document |author1 = Consumer Reports Health Best Buy Drugs |author1-link = Consumer Reports|title = The Oral Diabetes Drugs: Treating Type 2 Diabetes |publisher = [[Consumer Reports]] |work = Best Buy Drugs |page =2 |url = http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/DiabetesUpdate-FINAL-Feb09.pdf |accessdate = September 18, 2012}}</ref> Diet changes and exercise implementation may also be part of a treatment plan for diabetes.

===Low blood sugar===
{{main|hypoglycemia}}

If blood sugar levels drop too low, a potentially fatal condition called [[hypoglycemia]] develops. Symptoms may include [[lethargy]], impaired mental functioning; [[irritability]]; shaking, twitching, weakness in arm and leg muscles; pale complexion; sweating; paranoid or aggressive mentality and [[Unconsciousness|loss of consciousness]]. Brain damage is even possible.

Mechanisms that restore satisfactory blood glucose levels after extreme [[hypoglycemia]] (below 40&nbsp;mg/dl) must be quick and effective to prevent extremely serious consequences of insufficient glucose: confusion or unsteadiness and, in the extreme (below 15&nbsp;mg/dl)  loss of consciousness and seizures. It is far more dangerous to have too little glucose in the blood than too much, at least temporarily. In healthy individuals, blood glucose-regulating mechanisms are generally quite effective, and symptomatic hypoglycemia is generally found only in diabetics using insulin or other pharmacological treatment. Hypoglycemic episodes can vary greatly between persons and from time to time, both in severity and swiftness of onset. For severe cases, prompt medical assistance is essential, as damage to brain and other tissues and even death will result from sufficiently low blood-glucose levels.

==Glucose measurement==
{{Further| Blood glucose monitoring|Glucose meter}}

===Sample type===
Glucose is measured in whole blood, [[blood plasma|plasma]] or [[blood serum|serum]]. Historically, blood glucose values were given in terms of whole blood, but most laboratories now measure and report the [[Blood serum|serum]] glucose levels. Because [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes) have a higher concentration of protein (e.g., hemoglobin) than serum, serum has a higher water content and consequently more dissolved glucose than does whole blood. To convert from whole-blood glucose, multiplication by 1.15 has been shown to generally give the serum/plasma level.

Collection of blood in [[Serum-separating tube|clot tubes]] for serum chemistry analysis permits the metabolism of glucose in the sample by blood cells until separated by [[centrifugation]]. Red blood cells, for instance, do not require insulin to intake glucose from the blood. Higher than normal amounts of [[White blood cell|white]] or red blood cell counts can lead to excessive [[glycolysis]] in the sample, with substantial reduction of glucose level if the sample is not processed quickly. Ambient temperature at which the blood sample is kept prior to centrifuging and separation of plasma/serum also affects glucose levels. At refrigerator temperatures, glucose remains relatively stable for several hours in a blood sample. Loss of glucose can be prevented by using Fluoride tubes (i.e., gray-top) since fluoride inhibits glycolysis. However, these should only be used when blood will be transported from one hospital laboratory to another for glucose measurement. Red-top serum separator tubes also preserve glucose in samples after being centrifuged isolating the serum from cells.

To prevent contamination of the sample with [[intravenous fluids]], particular care should be given to drawing blood samples from the arm opposite the one in which an intravenous line is inserted. Alternatively, blood can be drawn from the same arm with an IV line after the IV has been turned off for at least 5 minutes, and the arm has been elevated to drain infused fluids away from the vein. Inattention can lead to large errors, since as little as 10% contamination with a 5% [[glucose]] solution (D5W) will elevate glucose in a sample by 500&nbsp;mg/dL or more. Remember that the actual concentration of glucose in blood is very low, even in the hyperglycemic.

Arterial, capillary and venous blood have comparable glucose levels in a fasting individual. Following meals, venous levels are somewhat lower than those in capillary or arterial blood; a common estimate is about 10%.

===Measurement techniques===
Two major methods have been used to measure glucose. The first, still in use in some places, is a chemical method exploiting the ''nonspecific reducing'' property of glucose in a reaction with an indicator substance that changes color when reduced. Since other blood compounds also have reducing properties (e.g., [[urea]], which can be abnormally high in [[uremia|uremic]] patients), this technique can produce erroneous readings in some situations (5 to 15&nbsp;mg/dL has been reported). The more recent technique, using [[enzyme]]s specific to glucose, is less susceptible to this kind of error. The two most common employed enzymes are [[glucose oxidase]] and [[hexokinase]].

In either case, the chemical system is commonly contained on a test strip which is inserted into a meter, and then has a blood sample applied. Test-strip shapes and their exact chemical composition vary between meter systems and cannot be interchanged. Formerly, some test strips were read (after timing and wiping away the blood sample) by visual comparison against a color chart printed on the vial label. Strips of this type are still used for urine glucose readings, but for blood glucose levels they are obsolete. Their error rates were, in any case, much higher.

[[Urine glucose]] readings, however taken, are much less useful. In properly functioning kidneys, glucose does not appear in urine until the [[renal threshold]] for glucose has been exceeded. This is substantially above any normal glucose level, and is evidence of an existing severe hyperglycemic condition. However, as urine is stored in the bladder, any glucose in it might have been produced at any time since the last time the bladder was emptied. Since metabolic conditions change rapidly, as a result of any of several factors, this is delayed news and gives no warning of a developing condition. Blood glucose monitoring is far preferable, both clinically and for home monitoring by patients. Healthy urine glucose levels were first standardized and published in 1965 <ref>{{cite journal|title=The upper limit of glucose concentration in the urine of healthy subjects|pmid=5851934|year=1965|last1=Renschler|first1=HE|last2=Weicker|first2=H|last3=Von Baeyer|first3=H|volume=90|issue=53|pages=2349–53|journal=Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)}}</ref> by [[Hans Renschler]].

===Blood glucose laboratory tests===
# fasting blood sugar (i.e., glucose) test (FBS)
# urine glucose test
# two-hr postprandial blood sugar test (2-h PPBS)
# oral [[glucose tolerance test]] (OGTT)
# intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT)
# glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>)
# self-monitoring of glucose level via patient testing
# Random blood sugar (RBS)

===Clinical correlation===
The fasting blood glucose level, which is measured after a fast of 8 hours, is the most commonly used indication of overall glucose homeostasis, largely because disturbing events such as food intake are avoided. Conditions affecting glucose levels are shown in the table below. Abnormalities in these test results are due to problems in the multiple control mechanism of glucose regulation.

The metabolic response to a carbohydrate challenge is conveniently assessed by a postprandial glucose level drawn 2 hours after a meal or a glucose load. In addition, the glucose tolerance test, consisting of several timed measurements after a standardized amount of oral glucose intake, is used to aid in the diagnosis of [[diabetes]]. 

Error rates for blood glucose measurements systems vary, depending on laboratories, and on the methods used. Colorimetry techniques can be biased by color changes in test strips (from airborne or finger borne contamination, perhaps) or interference (e.g., tinting contaminants) with light source or the light sensor. Electrical techniques are less susceptible to these errors, though not to others. In home use, the most important issue is not accuracy, but trend. Thus if a meter / test strip system is consistently wrong by 10%, there will be little consequence, as long as changes (e.g., due to exercise or medication adjustments) are properly tracked. In the US, home use blood test meters must be approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration before they can be sold.

Finally, there are several influences on blood glucose level aside from food intake. Infection, for instance, tends to change blood glucose levels, as does stress either physical or psychological. Exercise, especially if prolonged or long after the most recent meal, will have an effect as well. In the normal person, maintenance of blood glucose at near constant levels will nevertheless be quite effective. {{Clarify|date=August 2010}}

==Etymology and use of term==
In a [[physiology|physiological]] context, the term is a [[misnomer]] because it refers to glucose, yet other [[sugar]]s besides glucose are always present. Food contains several different types (e.g., [[fructose]] (largely from fruits/[[sucrose|table sugar]]/[[high fructose corn syrup|industrial sweeteners]]), [[galactose]] (milk and dairy products), as well as several food additives such as [[sorbitol]], [[xylose]], [[maltose]], etc.). But because these other sugars are largely [[inert]] with regard to the metabolic control system (i.e., that controlled by insulin secretion), since glucose is the dominant controlling signal for [[metabolism|metabolic]] regulation, the term has gained currency, and is used by medical staff and lay folk alike. The table above reflects some of the more technical and closely defined terms used in the medical field.
