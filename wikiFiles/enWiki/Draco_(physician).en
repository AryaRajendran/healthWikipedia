'''Draco''' (or '''Dracon''', {{lang-el|Δράκον}}) was the name of several [[physician]]s in the family of [[Hippocrates]].

*'''Draco I'''. Lived 5th to 4th centuries BC, was the son of [[Hippocrates]], the famous physician (Hippocrates II). He was the brother of [[Thessalus (physician)|Thessalus]].<ref>John Tzetzes, Chil. vii. Hist. 155; Suda, ''Hippocrates'', ι567; Galen, ''De Difficult. Respir.'', ii. 8, vol. vii.; ''Comment in Hippocr. Praedict. I.'', ii. 52, vol xvi.; ''Comment in Hippocr. De Nat. Hom.'', ii. 1, col. xv; Thessali, ''Orat. ad Aram'', and Sorani, ''Vita Hippocr.'' in Hippocr. ''Opera'', vol. iii</ref> [[Galen]] tells us that some of the writings of Hippocrates was attributed to his son Draco.

*'''Draco II'''. According to the [[Suda]],<ref>Suda, ''Dracon'', δ1497</ref> the son of Thessalus and grandson of Hippocrates II. He was the father of [[Hippocrates (physician)|Hippocrates IV]],<ref>Suda, ''Hippocrates'', ι567</ref> and would have been the brother of [[Hippocrates (physician)|Hippocrates III]]. He would have lived in the 4th century BC.

*'''Draco III'''. According to the Suda,<ref>Suda, ''Dracon'', δ1497</ref> the son of Hippocrates IV.

There may, however, be some confusion in the Suda, and it is possible that these three physicians are not all distinct persons.
