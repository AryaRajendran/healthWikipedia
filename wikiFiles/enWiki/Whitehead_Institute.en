Founded in 1982, the '''Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research''' is a non-profit research and teaching institution located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], [[USA]].
The Whitehead Institute was founded as a fiscally independent entity from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), and its members and associate members hold faculty appointments in MIT's Biology Department.

The institute is one of the world's leading centers for genomic research. Its [[Center for Genome Research]] was active in the [[Human Genome Project]], and reportedly contributed one-third of the human genome sequence announced in June 2000.<ref>{{cite web

In June 2003, [[Eli Broad|Eli and Edythe L. Broad]] pledged $100 million to build the [[Broad Institute]], a joint venture of Whitehead, [[MIT]], [[Harvard]] and local teaching hospitals. The new venture's mission is to expand tools for genomic medicine and apply them for the treatment of disease.

Whitehead has a world-renowned faculty that includes the recipients of the 1997 and 2010 [[National Medal of Science]] ([[Robert Weinberg]] and [[Susan Lindquist]], respectively);<ref>{{cite web

All Whitehead faculty are also members of the Biology Department at MIT. Members are tenured full and associate professors; Associate Members have tenure-track appointments. Whitehead also has an Affiliate Members program.
