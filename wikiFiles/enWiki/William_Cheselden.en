'''William Cheselden''' (19 October 1688 &ndash; 10 April 1752) was an [[England|English]] [[surgery|surgeon]] and teacher of [[anatomy]] and [[surgery]], who was influential in establishing surgery as a scientific medical profession.

==Life==
Cheselden was born at [[Somerby, Leicestershire]]. He studied [[anatomy]] in [[London]] under [[William Cowper (anatomist)|William Cowper]] (1666–1709), and began lecturing anatomy in 1710. That same year, he was admitted to the London [[Company of Barber-Surgeons]], passing the final examination on 29 January 1711.

He was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1712 and the following year saw the publishing of his ''Anatomy of the Human Body'', which achieved great popularity becoming an essential study source for students, lasting through thirteen editions, mainly because it was written in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]] as was customary. 

In 1718 he was appointed an assistant surgeon at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, becoming full surgeon in 1720 where his specialisation of the removal of [[bladder stones]] resulted in the increase in survival rates. Afterwards, he was appointed surgeon for the stone at [[Westminster]] [[Infirmary]] and surgeon to [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]]. He also improved eye surgery, developing new techniques, particularly in the removal of [[cataract]]s. Cheselden selected as a surgeon at [[St George's Hospital Medical School|St George's Hospital]] upon its foundation in 1733.

In 1733 he published ''Osteographia or the Anatomy of Bones'', the first full and accurate description of the anatomy of the human [[skeletal system]]. 

Cheselden retired from St Thomas' in 1738 and moved to the [[Chelsea Hospital]]. His abode is listed as "Chelsea College" on the 1739 [[Royal Charter]] for the [[Foundling Hospital]], a charity for which he was a founding governor. 

In 1744 he was elected to the position of Warden of the Company of Barber-Surgeons, and had a role in the separation of the surgeons from the barbers and to the creation of the independent [[Company of Surgeons]] in 1745, an organisation that would become later the famous [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]].

He died at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1752.

==First Surgical recovery from blindness==
Cheselden is credited with performing the first known case of full [[recovery from blindness]] in 1728, of a blind 13 year old boy.<ref name="newyork">{{cite web

Despite his youth, the boy encountered profound difficulties with the simplest visual perceptions. 
Described by Cheselden:
<blockquote>
When he first saw, he was so far from making any judgment of distances, that he thought all object whatever touched his eyes (as he expressed it) as what he felt did his skin, and thought no object so agreeable as those which were smooth and regular, though he could form no judgment of their shape, or guess what it was in any object that was pleasing to him: he knew not the shape of anything, nor any one thing from another, however different in shape or magnitude; but upon being told what things were, whose form he knew before from feeling, he would carefully observe, that he might know them again;<ref>''An Account of Some Observations Made by a Young Gentleman, Who Was Born Blind, or Lost His Sight so Early, That He Had no Remembrance of Ever Having Seen, and Was Couch'd between 13 and 14 Years of Age''. By Will. Cheselden. Philosophical Transactions (1683-1775), Vol. 35. (1727 - 1728), pp. 447-450.</ref>
</blockquote>

==Works==
Cheselden is famous for the invention of the lateral [[lithotomy]] approach to removing [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] stones, which he first performed in 1727. The procedure had a short duration (minutes instead of hours) and a low [[death|mortality]] rate (approximately 50%). Cheselden had already developed in 1723 the suprapubic approach, which he published in ''A Treatise on the High Operation for the Stone''. 

He also effected a great advance in [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic surgery]] by his operation, [[iridectomy]], described in 1728, to treat certain forms of [[blindness]] by producing an artificial [[pupil]]. Cheselden also described the role of [[saliva]] in [[digestion]]. He attended Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in his last illness and was an intimate friend of [[Alexander Pope]] and of Sir [[Hans Sloane]].
