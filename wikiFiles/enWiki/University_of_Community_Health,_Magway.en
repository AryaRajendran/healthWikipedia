The '''University of Community Health, Magway (UCH)''' ({{lang-my|ကျန်းမာရေး တက္ကသိုလ် (မကွေး)}}, {{IPA-my|tɕáɴmàjé tɛʔkəθò (məɡwé)|pron}}) is a public university located in [[Magway, Burma|Magway]], [[Myanmar]]. The university offers a four-year Bachelor of Community Health (B.Comm.H.) degree program. The graduates are allowed to practice as health assistants, many of whom are the main providers of primary health care in rural Myanmar where access to regular [[physicians]] is difficult.

==History==
UCH was founded as the Health Assistant Training School in 1951 in [[Yangon]] to provide health care to rural population. The school was moved a few kilometers north to [[Insein township|Insein]] in 1963, and then to [[Hlegu]] in 1968. In 1989, the school came under the purview of the [[Ministry of Health (Burma)|Ministry of Health]]. The school became the Institute of Community Health in 1991, and became a university in 1995 and began offering a four-year bachelor's degree program. In 1999, the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]] moved the school out of [[Yangon Division]] to Upper Myanmar. UCH is located on a 41.4-hectare campus at Htonpauk, about 14.5&nbsp;km north of Magway, and 3.2&nbsp;km off the Magway-Natmauk Road.<ref name="mrtv3"/>
