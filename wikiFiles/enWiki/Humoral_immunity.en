'''Humoral immunity''' (also called the antibody-mediated system) is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by macromolecules (as opposed to [[cell-mediated  immunity]]) found in extracellular fluids such as secreted antibodies, complement proteins and certain antimicrobial peptides. Humoral immunity is so named because it involves substances found in the [[Humorism|humours]], or body fluids. 

The study of the molecular and cellular components that comprise the [[immune system]], including their function and interaction, is the central science of [[immunology]]. The immune system is divided into a more primitive [[innate immune system]], and acquired or [[adaptive immune system]] of vertebrates, each of which contains '''humoral''' and [[cellular immunity|cellular]] components.

Humoral immunity refers to antibody production and the accessory processes that accompany it, including: [[Th2]] activation and [[cytokine]] production, [[germinal center]] formation and [[Isotype (immunology)|isotype]] switching, [[affinity maturation]] and [[memory cell]] generation. It also refers to the [[effector (biology)|effector]] functions of antibody, which include pathogen and toxin neutralization, classical [[Complement system|complement]] activation, and [[opsonin]] promotion of [[phagocytosis]] and pathogen elimination.<ref name=Janeway5>{{cite book | author = [[Charles Janeway|Janeway]] CA  | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 | id = [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10 (electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf)] | author-separator = , | author2 = Jr.| display-authors = 2 | isbn = 0-8153-3642-X }}</ref>

==History==
The concept of humoral immunity developed based on analysis of [[antibacterial]] activity of the components of serum. [[Hans Buchner (biologist)|Hans Buchner]] is credited with the development of the humoral theory.<ref name= Metch>[[Elie Metchnikoff|Metchnikoff, Elie]] (1905) [http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03666307&id=ywKp9YhK5t0C&printsec=titlepage&vq=Ehrlich&dq=history+of+humoral+immunity Immunity in infectious disease] (Full Text Version) Cambridge University Press</ref> In 1890 he described alexins, or “protective substances”, which exist in the serum and other bodily fluid and are capable of killing microorganisms. Alexins, later redefined "complement" by [[Paul Ehrlich]], were shown to be the [[soluble]] components of the innate response that lead to a combination of cellular and humoral immunity, and bridged the features of innate and acquired immunity.<ref name= Metch/>

Following the 1888 discovery of [[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus]], [[Emil von Behring]] and [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] showed that disease need not be caused by microorganisms themselves. They discovered that cell-free filtrates were sufficient to cause disease.  In 1890, filtrates of diphtheria (later named [[diphtheria toxin]]s) were used to [[vaccination|immunize]] animals in an attempt to demonstrate that immunized serum contained an [[antitoxin]] that could neutralize the activity of the toxin and could transfer immunity to non immune animals.<ref name= G.E>Gherardi E. [http://nfs.unipv.it/nfs/minf/dispense/immunology/lectures/files/foundations_immunology.html The experimental foundations of Immunology] Immunology Course Medical School, University of Pavia.</ref> In 1897, Paul Ehrlich showed that antibodies form against the plant toxins [[ricin]] and [[abrin]], and proposed that these antibodies are responsible for immunity.<ref name= Metch/> Ehrlich, with his friend Emil von Behring, went on to develop the diphtheria antitoxin, which became the first major success of modern [[immunotherapy]].<ref name= G.E/> The presence and specificity of compatibility antibodies became the major tool for standardizing the state of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and identifying the presence of previous infections.<ref name= G.E/>

==Complement system==
{{main|Complement system}}
The complement system is a biochemical cascade of the innate immune system that helps clear pathogens from an organism. It is derived from many small plasma [[proteins]] that work together to disrupt the target cell's [[plasma membrane]] leading to cytolysis of the cell. The complement system consists of more than 35 soluble and cell-bound proteins, 12 of which are directly involved in the complement pathways.<ref name=Janeway5/> The complement system is involved in the activities of both innate immunity and acquired immunity.

Activation of this system leads to [[cytolysis]], [[chemotaxis]], [[opsonization]], immune clearance, and [[inflammation]], as well as the marking of pathogens for [[phagocytosis]]. The proteins account for 5% of the [[Blood serum|serum]] [[globulin]] fraction. Most of these proteins circulate as [[zymogen]]s, which are inactive until [[proteolytic cleavage]]. 

Three biochemical pathways activate the complement system: the [[classical complement pathway]], the [[alternate complement pathway]], and the [[mannose-binding lectin pathway]]. 
The classical complement pathway typically requires antibodies for activation and is a specific immune response, while the alternate pathway can be activated without the presence of antibodies and is considered a non-specific immune response.<ref name=Janeway5/> Antibodies, in particular the IgG1 class, can also "fix" complement.

==Antibodies==
{{main|Antibody}}
Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily that function as antibodies. The terms ''antibody'' and ''immunoglobulin'' are often used interchangeably. They are found in the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions. In structure, they are large Y-shaped globular proteins. In mammals there are five types of antibody: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Each immunoglobulin class differs in its biological properties and has evolved to deal with different antigens.<ref name=Pier>{{cite book | author =  Pier GB, Lyczak JB, Wetzler LM | title = Immunology, Infection, and Immunity | edition = | publisher = ASM Press| year = 2004 | isbn = 1-55581-246-5}}</ref> Antibodies are synthesized and secreted by plasma cells that are derived from the B cells of the immune system. 

An antibody is used by the acquired immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody recognizes a specific antigen unique to its target. By binding their specific antigens, antibodies can cause [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] and precipitation of antibody-antigen products, prime for phagocytosis by macrophages and other cells, block [[virus|viral]] receptors, and stimulate other immune responses, such as the complement pathway. 

An incompatible [[blood transfusion]] causes a [[transfusion reaction]], which is mediated by the humoral immune response. This type of reaction, called an acute hemolytic reaction, results in the rapid destruction ([[hemolysis]]) of the donor [[red blood cell]]s by host antibodies. The cause is usually a clerical error (i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the wrong patient). The symptoms are fever and chills, sometimes with back pain and pink or red [[urine]] ([[hemoglobinuria]]). The major complication is that [[hemoglobin]] released by the destruction of red blood cells can cause [[acute renal failure]].

==B cells==
{{main|B cell}}
The principal function of B cells is to make antibodies against soluble antigens. B cell recognition of antigen is not the only element necessary for B cell activation (a combination of clonal [[cell growth|proliferation]] and terminal [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] into [[plasma cell]]s).

Naïve B cells can be activated in a T-cell dependent or independent manner, but two signals are always required to initiate activation. 

B cell activation depends on one of three mechanisms: ''Type 1 T cell-independent'' ([[polyclonal response|polyclonal]]) activation, ''Type 2 T cell-independent'' activation (in which mature B cells respond to highly repetitive structures causing cross-linking of the B cell receptors on the surface of B cells), and T cell-dependent activation. During [[T cell]]-dependent activation, an [[antigen presenting cell]] (APC) presents a processed antigen to a helper T (T<sub>h</sub>) cell, priming it.  When a B cell processes and presents the ''same'' antigen to the ''primed T<sub>h</sub> cell'', the T cell releases [[cytokine]]s that activate the B cell.<ref name=Janeway5/>
