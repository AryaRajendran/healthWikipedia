The '''East Anglian Air Ambulance''' is an [[air ambulance]] providing Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) across the counties of [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], [[Cambridgeshire]] and [[Bedfordshire]]. The appeal to fund the service was launched in the summer of 2000 by top jockey [[Frankie Dettori]], who had been a casualty in a serious plane crash a couple of months earlier. Flying commenced in January 2001 and the service was initially available only one day a week.  The East Anglian Air Ambulance now operates two helicopters from its bases at [[Cambridge]] and [[Norwich]] airports, and the service now operates 365 days, covering over {{convert|5000|sqmi|km2}} and a population of approximately 2.5 million.<ref>[http://www.angliaone.org.uk/About_us.html East Anglian Air Ambulance - About Us]</ref> 

==Mission==
EAAA's mission statement is: "To alleviate suffering and save lives, by the rapid delivery of specialist clinicians and equipment to accidents and medical emergencies and the subsequent transfer of patients to and between hospitals".

The Charity provides air ambulance cover for East Anglia, in association with [[East of England Ambulance Service]] NHS Trust, which provides highly skilled critical care [[paramedics]] who fly with the Charity.

==Aircraft==
EAAA's first aircraft was a [[Bolkow 105]], commissioned from Sterling Aviation.  The aircraft was based at [[Norwich International Airport]] and had the call sign 'Anglia One'.

In June 2006 a new helicopter, a [[MBB/Kawasaki BK 117]], G-OEMT, was commissioned from Sterling Aviation.  The aircraft replaced the [[Bolkow 105]], G-EYNL, and went into service as Anglia One.  In August 2007 and second [[MBB/Kawasaki BK 117]], G-RESC, went into service with EAAA as Anglia Two.

In March 2011 EAAA changed operator and moved from Sterling Aviation to interim supplier, [[Bond Air Services]].  Bond later successfully tendered for the contract to operate Anglia One and Anglia Two.  During the interim period EAAA flew red aircraft but soon returned to their more familiar yellow livery with the introduction of the [[Eurocopter EC135]].

In 2012 EAAA commissioned the fully night-capable EC135T2e and look forward to beginning their night flying service in 2013.

Both Anglia One and Anglia Two are fitted with the most up-to-date medical equipment and are dedicated ambulance helicopters.

Anglia One covers [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]] and is based at [[Norwich International Airport]].  Anglia Two covers [[Bedfordshire]] and Cambridgeshire and is based at [[Cambridge Airport]] although both can and do fly further afield when required.  EAAA works together with [[Essex and Herts Air Ambulance Trust]] to ensure there is always cover across the whole region.  

== Operations ==
When the service was first launched, Anglia One operated for only one day a week.  This was soon expanded to five days a week and later to the current service of seven days a week.

Anglia Two was launched in August 2007 and began operating five days a week (from Sunday to Thursday).  The service provided by Anglia Two was extended to seven days a week in 2008.  It was manned by the Emergency Medical Team from [[Magpas|Magpas Helimedix 24/7]]<ref>{{Citation

Typical incidents for which the assistance of the air ambulance is requested include road traffic collisions, horse riding accidents, cardiac arrests and serious falls.  The EAAA team of highly skilled doctors and critical care paramedics also treat many people injured in agricultural, industrial and sporting accidents.  

Airlifted patients are most likely to go to the major trauma centre at [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]], the specialist burns unit in [[Broomfield Hospital]], Chelmsford or the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]].

== Aircrew ==
For the majority of call-outs each East Anglian Air Ambulance will carry a crew of three; one [[pilot]], one critical care paramedic and one doctor (usually a specialist in emergency medicine or anesthetics).  

The EAAA crew with their expertise and training are able to 'take the hospital emergency room to the patient'.  The speed in which EAAA helicopters can reach people suffering a medical emergency or accident is critical in ensuring a good recovery for the patient.  EAAA can provide at the scene of the incident just about all the procedures that would be expected in a hospital.  For that reason, once the EAAA doctor and paramedic crew have treated the patient, it is often safe for them to then travel on to the hosptial for further treatment by road.  EAAA fly approximately a third of their patients and this is either because of the critical nature of their condition or the remoteness of the incident.

== Control decision ==
The control centre for East Anglian Air Ambulance tasking is located in [[Chelmsford]] and is staffed twenty four hours a day, every day of the year by an [[East of England Ambulance Service]] NHS Trust dispatcher and a critical care paramedic.  They know what to look for in an emergency call and can ensure that the helicopter is mobilised when its life-saving services are required.  The decision is made by the doctor at the scene of the incident as to whether the patient should go by land ambulance, or be flown to hospital on the air ambulance.  

== Finances ==
The East Anglian Air Ambulance is a charitable service and does not receive funding from the government. It is estimated that it costs £6m a year<ref>[http://www.angliaone.org.uk/The_Helicopters_-_technical_information.html East Anglian Air Ambulance - Helicopter Technical Information]</ref> to keep both helicopters and the service operational; this money comes entirely from public donations and fundraising activities, including the purchase of weekly lottery tickets, corporate donations and legacy giving.
