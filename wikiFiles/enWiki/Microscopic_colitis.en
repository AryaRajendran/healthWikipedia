'''Microscopic colitis''' refers to two medical conditions which cause [[diarrhea]]: [[collagenous colitis]] and [[lymphocytic colitis]]. Both conditions are characterised by the following triad of clinicopathological features: 
# Chronic watery diarrhoea;
# Normal [[colonoscopy]];
# Characteristic [[histopathology]].

== Clinical features ==
Patients are characteristically, though not exclusively, middle-aged [[female]]s. They present with a long history of watery diarrhoea, which may be profuse. There is a higher incidence of [[autoimmune disease]]s, for example [[arthritis]], [[Sjögren's syndrome]], and [[coeliac disease]], in patients with microscopic colitis. There are reports of associations with multiple drugs, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ([[NSAID]]s).

Colonoscopy is normal or near normal. The changes are often patchy, so multiple colonic biopsies must be taken in order to make the diagnosis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A full colonoscopy is required, as an examination limited to the rectum will miss cases of microscopic colitis.

== Pathology ==
The hallmark of microscopic colitis is an increase in [[inflammatory cell]]s (i.e., [[lymphocytes]]) in colonic [[biopsies]] with an otherwise normal appearance and architecture of the colon. Inflammatory cells are increased both in the surface [[epithelium]] ("intraepithelial lymphocytes") and in the [[lamina propria]]. In lymphocytic colitis, these are the only abnormal features.

In collagenous colitis, the features of lymphocytic colitis are present, with, in addition, the presence of a thickened subepithelial [[collagen]] layer which may be up to 30 [[micrometre]]s thick.

== Treatment ==
No single treatment is accepted as the standard, and measuring response is difficult. Often a trial of [[anti-diarrhoeal]]s is followed by [[anti-inflammatory drug]]s. 

Lymphocytic colitis is thought to respond well to bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) and [[mesalazine]] and collagenous colitis to respond well to [[budesonide]].<ref name=fernandez>{{cite journal | author = Fernández-Bañares F, Salas A, Esteve M, Espinós J, Forné M, Viver J | title = Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis. evaluation of clinical and histological features, response to treatment, and long-term follow-up. | journal = Am J Gastroenterol | volume = 98 | issue = 2 | pages = 340–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12591052 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2003.07225.x}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis is good, and both conditions are considered to be benign.<ref name=mullhaupt>{{cite journal | author = Mullhaupt B, Güller U, Anabitarte M, Güller R, Fried M | title = Lymphocytic colitis: clinical presentation and long term course | journal = Gut | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 629–33 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9824342 | doi = 10.1136/gut.43.5.629 | pmc = 1727313}}</ref>  The majority of people afflicted with the conditions recover from their diarrhea, and their histological abnormalities resolve.<ref name=fernandez/>
