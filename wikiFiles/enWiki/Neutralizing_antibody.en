A '''Neutralizing antibody''', or '''NAb''' is an [[antibody]] which defends a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] from an [[antigen]] or infectious body by [[:wikt:inhibit|inhibit]]ing or neutralizing any effect it has biologically.<ref name="Def">{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Neutralizing_antibody|title=Neutralising antibody|year=2008|publisher=Biology-Online|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> An example of a neutralizing antibody is [[diphtheria antitoxin]], which can neutralize the biological effects of [[diphtheria toxin]].<ref name="Path-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=450600&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d450600|title=AssessScience|publisher=McGraw-Hill|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

==Neutralization Method==
Most antibodies work by binding to an antigen, signaling to a white blood cell that this antigen has been targeted, after which the antigen is processed and consequently destroyed. The difference between neutralizing antibodies and binding antibodies is that neutralizing antibodies neutralize the biological effects of the antigen, while binding antibodies flag antigens.<ref name="Freedman" /> This difference can be shown with IFN-beta;  <blockquote>
"Antibodies can simply bind to IFN-beta or glatiramer acetate (binding Ab, or BAb) with no subsequent effect on function, or they can block or neutralize (neutralizing Ab, or NAb) their biological activity." --Mark S. Freedman, MD, MSc
</blockquote>
This difference is what gives neutralizing antibodies the ability to fight viruses which attack the immune system, since they can neutralize function without a need for white blood cells (excluding production)<ref name="Freedman">{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/461270|title=The Role of Neutralizing Antibodies in MS Treatments |last=Freedman|first=Mark S.|date=August 30, 2003|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>

==Modern testing==
Neutralizing antibodies have shown potential in the treatment of [[retroviral|retroviral infections]]. Medical professionals and researchers have shown how the encoding of [[gene]]s which influence the production of this particular type of antibody could help in the treatment of [[infection]]s which attack the [[immune system]]. Professionals in the field have used [[HIV]] treatment as an example of infections these antibodies can treat.<ref name="SciMag">{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/321/5894/1343|title=Apobec3 Encodes Rfv3, a Gene Influencing Neutralizing Antibody Control of Retrovirus Infection |journal=Science Magazine |last=Satiago|first=Mario L.|coauthors=Mauricio Montano, Robert Benitez, Ronald J. Messer, at al. |year=2008 |publisher=AAAS |accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> Recently, potent and broadly neutralizing human antibodies against influenza (such as [[CR6261]]), HIV and hepatitis C have been reported, and have suggested possible strategies to generate an improved vaccine that would confer long-lasting immunity.  Another [[disease]] which has been linked to the production of neutralizing antibodies is [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="Stachowiak"/>  The use of medicines which modify diseases is nothing new, used in regulation for multiple sclerosis since 1998 when the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Consensus Statement recommended their use.

===Pharmaceutical Problems===
Although this type of antibody has the ability to fight [[retroviral]] infections, in some cases it attacks [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] administered to the body which would otherwise treat [[multiple sclerosis]]. Recombinant protein drugs, especially those derived from animals, are commonly targeted by neutralizing antibodies. A few examples are Rebif, Betaseron and Avonex.<ref name="Stachowiak" />
