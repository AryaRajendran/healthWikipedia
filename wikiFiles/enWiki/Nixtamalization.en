'''Nixtamalization''' typically refers to a process for the preparation of [[maize|maize (corn)]], or other grain, in which the [[grain]] is soaked and [[cooking|cooked]] in an [[alkaline]] solution, usually [[limewater]], and [[hulling|hulled]].

The term can also refer to the removal via an alkali process of the [[pericarp]] from other grains such as [[sorghum]]. Maize subjected to the nixtamalization process has several benefits over unprocessed grain for food preparation: it is more easily ground; its [[nutrition]]al value is increased; [[flavor]] and [[aroma]] are improved; and [[mycotoxin]]s are reduced. These benefits make nixtamalization a crucial preliminary step for further processing of maize into food products, and the process is employed using both traditional and industrial methods, in the production of [[tortilla]]s, [[Tamal (dish)|tamale]]s, [[corn chip]]s, [[hominy]] and many other items.

==Etymology==
In the [[Aztec]] language [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], the word for the product of this procedure is ''nixtamalli'' or ''nextamalli'' ({{IPA-nah|niʃtaˈmalːi|pron}} or {{IPA|[neʃtaˈmalːi]}}), which in turn has yielded [[Mexican Spanish]] ''nixtamal'' ({{IPA-es|nistaˈmal|}}). The Nahuatl word is a compound of ''nextli'' "ashes" and ''tamalli'' "unformed corn dough, [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]." The term ''nixtamalization'' (spelled with the "t") can also be used to describe the removal of the pericarp from any grain by an alkali process, including maize, [[sorghum]], and others.  When the unaltered Spanish spelling ''nixtamalización'' is used in written English, however, it almost exclusively refers to maize.

The labels on packages of commercially-sold tortillas prepared with nixtamalized maize usually list ''corn treated with lime'' as an ingredient in English, while the Spanish versions list ''maíz nixtamalizado''.

==History==

===Mesoamerica===
[[File:Dried Maize Mote from Oaxaca.png|thumb|right|Dried, untreated maize sold [[Oaxaca]], Mexico]]
The ancient process of nixtamalization was first developed in [[Mesoamerica]], where [[maize]] was originally cultivated. There is no precise date when the technology was developed, but the earliest evidence of nixtamalization is found in Guatemala's southern coast, with equipment dating from 1200–1500 BC{{fact|date=February 2013}}.

The ancient [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilizations developed nixtamalization using lime ([[calcium hydroxide]], not the [[citrus fruit]] of the same name) and ash ([[potassium hydroxide]]) to create alkaline solutions. The [[Chibcha]] people to the north of the ancient [[Inca]] also used calcium hydroxide (also known as "cal"), while the tribes of North America used naturally occurring [[sodium carbonate]] or ash.

The nixtamalization process was very important in the early Mesoamerican diet, as unprocessed maize is deficient in free [[niacin]]. A population depending on untreated maize as a [[staple food]] risks malnourishment, and is more likely to develop [[deficiency disease]]s such as [[pellagra]]. Maize also is deficient in essential amino acids, which can result in [[kwashiorkor]].  Maize cooked with lime provided niacin in this diet. Beans, when consumed with the maize, provided the amino acids required to balance the diet for [[complete protein|protein]].

The spread of maize cultivation in the Americas was accompanied by the adoption of the nixtamalization process.  Traditional and contemporary regional cuisines (including [[Maya diet and subsistence|Maya Cuisine]], [[Aztec|Aztec cuisine]], and [[Mexican cuisine]]) included, and still include, foods based on nixtamalized maize.

The process has not substantially declined in usage in the Mesoamerican region, though there has been a decline in North America.  Many North American Native American tribes, such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], no longer use the process.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In some Mesoamerican and North American regions, dishes are still made from nixtamalized maize prepared by traditional techniques. The [[Hopi]] obtain the necessary alkali from ashes of various native plants and trees.<ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Diabetes As a Disease of Civilization: The Impact of Culture Change on Indigenous People |author=Jennie Rose Joe and Robert S.

In the United States, European settlers did not always adopt the nixtamalization process, except in the case of hominy grits, though maize became a staple among the poor of the southern states. This led to endemic [[pellagra]] in poor populations throughout the southern US in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | title = Definition of Pellagra| work = MedicineNet.com | url = http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4821 | accessdate = 2008-02-10}}</ref>  Fortification of wheat flour, the other staple food, essentially has eliminated this deficiency.

Afterwards, the hulls are removed and the kernels ground into [[masa|dough]]. However, exact cooking methods vary according to use and region.]]

===Europe, Africa, and India===
Maize was introduced to Europe by [[Christopher Columbus]] in the 15th century, being grown in [[Spain]] as early as 1498. Due to its high yields, it quickly spread through Europe, and later to Africa and India. Portuguese colonists grew maize in the [[Portuguese Congo|Congo]] as early as 1560, and maize became, and remains, a major food crop in parts of Africa.

Adoption of the nixtamalization process did not accompany the grain to Europe and beyond, perhaps because the Europeans already had more efficient milling processes for hulling grain mechanically. Without alkaline processing, [[maize]] is a much less beneficial foodstuff, and malnutrition struck many areas where it became a dominant food crop. In the nineteenth century, [[pellagra]] epidemics were recorded in France, Italy, and Egypt, and [[kwashiorkor]] hit parts of Africa where maize had become a dietary staple.

Health problems associated with maize-based diets in modern times have usually been remedied by means of vitamin supplements and economic improvement leading to a broader diet, rather than by adoption of nixtamalization. Though pellagra has vanished from Europe and the United States, it remains a major public health problem in lower Egypt, parts of South Africa, and southwestern India{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

== Process ==
[[File:Nixtamal.jpg|right]]

The first step in nixtamalization, kernels of dried maize are cooked in an alkaline solution at or near the mixture's boiling point. After cooking, the maize is steeped in the cooking liquid for a period. The length of time for which the maize is boiled and soaked varies according to local traditions and the type of food being prepared, with cooking times ranging from a few minutes to an hour, and soaking times from a few minutes to about a day.

During cooking and soaking, a number of chemical changes take place in the grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including [[hemicellulose]] and [[pectin]], are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or [[potassium]] (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and [[starch gelatinization|gelatinize]], and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the [[endosperm]] of the kernel more available to the human body.

After cooking, the alkaline liquid (known as '''nejayote'''), containing dissolved hull, starch, and other corn matter, is decanted and discarded (or sometimes used in producing [[amatl]] paper).<ref>{{cite book

The [[pericarp]] is then removed, leaving the [[endosperm]] of the [[whole grain|grain]] with or without the [[cereal germ|germ]] depending on the process.<ref>{{cite web | title=What is Hominy? | url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/what-is-hominy.html | accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Nixtamalization, a Mesoamerican technology | url=http://74.6.238.252/search/srpcache?ei=UTF-8&p=nixtamalization+germ&fr=altavista&u=http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=nixtamalization+germ&d=4892844087183950&mkt=en-US&setlang=en-US&w=f7949c99,15694ecd&icp=1&.intl=us&sig=Rl3KbkpqQ_QD4uM69aUYCg-- | accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Technological Limitations of the Nixtamalization Process | url=http://www.maiztortilla.com/en/introduction/limitations.htm | accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Selective Nixtamalization of Fractions of Maize Grain | url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Paper/12460489.aspx | accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=What’s the difference between corn meal and corn masa? | url=http://www.joepastry.com/2010/11/04/ | accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref> This hulling is performed by hand, in traditional or very small-scale preparation, or mechanically, in larger scale or industrial production.

The prepared grain is called '''nixtamal'''. Nixtamal has many uses, contemporary and historic. Whole nixtamal may be used fresh or dried for later use. Whole nixtamal is used in the preparation of [[pozole]] and [[menudo (soup)|menudo]], and other foods. Ground fresh nixtamal is made into [[masa|dough]] and used to make [[tortilla]]s, [[tamale]]s, and [[arepa]]s. Dried and ground, it is called [[masa harina]] or instant masa flour, and is reconstituted and used like masa.

The term [[hominy]] may refer to whole, coarsely ground, or finely ground nixtamal, or to a cooked porridge (also called [[samp]]) prepared from any of these.

=== Enzymatic nixtamalization ===
An alternative process for use in industrial settings has been developed known as '''enzymatic nixtamalization''' which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°-60°C in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground with little or no washing or hulling.

By pre-soaking the maize, minimizing the alkali used to adjust the pH of the alkaline solution, reducing the cooking temperature, accelerating processing, and reusing excess processing liquids, enzymatic nixtamalization can reduce the use of energy and water, lower nejayote waste production, decrease maize lost in processing, and shorten the production time (to approximately four hours) compared to traditional nixtamalization.<ref>*[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6428828-description.html Enzymatic process for nixtamalization of cereal grains, US Patent Issued on August 6, 2002]</ref>

Effects of enzymatic nixtamalization on flavor, aroma, nutritional value, and cost, compared to traditional methods, are not well documented.

==Impact on health==

The primary nutritional benefits of nixtamalization arise from the alkaline processing involved. These conditions convert corn's bound niacin to free niacin, making it available for absorption into the body, thus preventing [[pellagra]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Alkalinity also reduces the amount of the protein [[zein]] available to the body, which improves the balance among essential amino acids, although the overall amount of protein is reduced.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Secondary benefits can arise from the grain's absorption of minerals from the alkali used or from the vessels used in preparation. These effects can increase [[calcium]] (by 750%, with 85% available for absorption), [[iron]], [[copper]] and [[zinc]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Lastly, nixtamalization significantly reduces (by 90-94%) [[mycotoxin]]s produced by ''[[Fusarium verticillioides]]'' and ''[[Fusarium proliferatum]]'', molds that commonly infect maize and the toxins of which are putative carcinogens.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
