'''Hyperchloremia''' is an [[electrolyte disturbance]] in which there is an abnormally elevated level of the [[chloride]] ion in the [[blood]]. The normal serum range for chloride is 97 to 107 [[equivalent (chemistry)|mEq/L]]. Hyperchloremia is defined as a chloride concentration exceeding this level.

Hyperchloremia can affect oxygen transport.<ref name="pmid9760315">{{cite journal |author=Cambier C, Detry B, Beerens D, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of hyperchloremia on blood oxygen binding in healthy calves |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=1267â€“72 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9760315 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9760315}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Often hyperchloremia does not produce any symptoms. However, hyperchloremia is sometimes associated with excess fluid loss such as vomiting and diarrhea. If the sufferer were to be a diabetic, hyperchloremia could lead to poor control of [[blood sugar]] concentration, which could cause it to become elevated. Hyperchloremia can be symptomatic with signs of [[Kussmaul's breathing]], weakness, and intense thirst.

==Causes==
Elevations in chloride may be associated with administration significant amounts of IV normal saline, [[diarrhea]], certain [[kidney]] diseases as Renal tubular acidosis type II (Lightwood syndrome), Renal tubular acidosis type I, and overactivity of the [[parathyroid gland]]s.  Hyperchloremia is often [[comorbidity|comorbid]] with [[diabetes]] or [[hyponatremia]]. Certain drugs, especially [[diuretic]]s such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, [[hormone|hormonal]] treatments, and [[polypharmacy]], may contribute to this disorder.

==Treatment==
As with most types of electrolyte imbalance, the treatment of high blood chloride levels is based on correcting the underlying cause.

*If the patient is dehydrated, therapy consists of establishing and maintaining adequate hydration. 

*If the condition is caused or exacerbated by medications or treatments, these may be altered or discontinued, if deemed prudent.

*If there is underlying kidney disease (which is likely if there are other electrolyte disturbances), then the patient will be referred to a [[nephrologist]] for further care.

*If there is an underlying dysfunction of the endocrine or hormone system, the patient will likely be referred to an [[endocrinologist]] for further assessment.
