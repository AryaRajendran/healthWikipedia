The '''National Museum of Health and Medicine''' (NMHM) is a museum in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], USA.<ref name="NIH NMHM page">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/nmhm.html</ref> The museum was founded by [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|U.S. Army Surgeon General]] [[William Alexander Hammond|William A. Hammond]] as the '''Army Medical Museum''' (AMM) in 1862;<ref>http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/542.html</ref> it became the NMHM in 1989<ref name="NMHM FAQ2.1">http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/about/faq/index.html#2.1</ref> and relocated to its present site at the Army's [[Forest Glen Annex]] in 2011. An element of the [[U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]]<ref name="NIH NMHM page" /> (USAMRMC), the NMHM is a member of the National Health Sciences Consortium.<ref>http://www.city-data.com/articles/National-Museum-of-Health-Medicine.html</ref>  

== History ==
[[Image:Army Medical School.jpg|thumb|left|The '''[[Army Medical Museum and Library]]''' building  housed the '''Army Medical Museum''' from 1887 to 1947  — and again from 1962 to 1969, when the building was razed.]]

===19th century===
The AMM was established during the [[American Civil War]]<ref name="NMHM FAQ2.1" /> as a center for the collection of specimens for research in military medicine and surgery.<ref name="NMHM about">http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/about/about.html</ref> In 1862, Hammond directed medical officers in the field to collect "specimens of morbid anatomy ... together with projectiles and foreign bodies removed"<ref name="NMHM about" /> and to forward them to the newly founded museum for study. The AMM's first curator, [[John H. Brinton]], visited mid-Atlantic battlefields and solicited contributions from doctors throughout the [[Union Army]]. During and after the war, AMM staff took pictures of wounded soldiers showing effects of gunshot wounds as well as results of amputations and other surgical procedures. The information collected was compiled into six volumes of ''[[The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion]]'', published between 1870 and 1883.<ref name="NMHM about" />

===20th century===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, AMM staff engaged in various types of medical research. They pioneered in photomicrographic techniques, established a library and cataloging system which later formed the basis for the [[National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), and led the AMM into research on [[infectious disease]]s while discovering the cause of [[yellow fever]]. They contributed to research on vaccinations for [[typhoid fever]], and during [[World War I]], AMM staff were involved in vaccinations and health education campaigns, including major efforts to combat sexually transmissible diseases.<ref name="NMHM about" />
[[Image:NationalMuseumOfHealthAndMedicine.jpg|thumb|right|The former '''NMHM''' building (actually the basement of the AFIP building) on the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] (WRAMC) garrison, Washington, DC, where it was housed from 1971 to 2011.]]

By [[World War II]], research at the AMM focused increasingly on pathology. In 1946 the AMM became a division of the new Army Institute of Pathology (AIP), which became the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]] (AFIP) in 1949. The AMM's library and part of its archives were transferred to the [[National Library of Medicine]] when that institution was created in 1956. The AMM itself became the Medical Museum of the AFIP in 1949, the Armed Forces Medical Museum in 1974, and finally the NMHM in 1989.<ref name="NMHM about" /> During its peak years on the National Mall in the 1960s, the Museum saw "as many as 400,000 to 500,000 people coming through" annually. But after its moves to increasingly obscure and out-of-the-way sites, it fell into a period of relative neglect. By the 1990s, it was attracting only between 40,000 and 50,000 visitors a year. <ref>Tanouye, Erik, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-02-12/news/1998043124_1_health-museum-national-mall-mall-museums “National Mall Running Out of Space: Federal Planners Want No More Museums in the 2-mile Strip”], ''[[Hearst News Service]]'', February 12, 1998.</ref>

In 1989, [[C. Everett Koop]] (in his last year as [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]) commissioned the "National Museum of Health and Medicine Foundation", a private, nonprofit organization to explore avenues for its future development and revitalization, with the aim of ultimately returning its collection to a venue on the [[National Mall]]. <ref>Abse, Nathan, [http://209.195.132.195/achievementSubDetail.asp?recipientID=39&AchievementID=79 “Push Is On for New Medical Museum as Old Collection Is Modernized”], ''[[Washington Post]]'', December 16, 1997.</ref> Proposed was “a site on land that is located east of and adjacent to the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Building]] (100 Independence Avenue, Southwest, in the District of Columbia)” <ref>This spot is at Third Street and Independence Avenue SW. See: 108 STAT. 2852 PUBLIC LAW 103-337 —OCT. 5, 1994 (c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.</ref> In 1993, a draft bill authored by Sen. [[Edward Kennedy]]  proposed $21.8 million for moving the existing collection to a new facility to be constructed on that site. That bill, however, was never introduced owing to political difficulties including objections from [[Constance Breuer]] -- widow of [[Marcel Breuer]], architect of the Humphrey Building --  who objected to the view obstruction that would be entailed by the proposed construction. A letter from the Department of Defense to Koop in the mid-1990s, expressed hope that the NMHM exhibits would "one day be provided the appropriate and prominent home they deserve back at the National Mall in the new National Health Museum." But the DoD backed away from contributing to funding a new museum.<ref>Abse (1997), ''[[Op. cit.]]''</ref> The Foundation has since been superseded by a new organization, dedicated to creating a new [[National Health Museum]], and which has more ambitious aims and is not dependent on what happens to the existing NMHM.

===2011 Move===
Due to the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center#Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|closure of WRAMC]], NMHM has relocated — for the tenth time — to [[Forest Glen Annex|US Army Garrison-Forest Glen]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland]].<ref>Palk, Justin M. (2008), [http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/display.htm?StoryID=81132 “Fort Detrick to take over Forest Glen”], FrederickNewsPost.com, 7 October 2008.</ref> Authority over the Forest Glen garrison was transferred from WRAMC to [[Fort Detrick]] in October 2008. The NMHM [http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/news/exhibits_closing.html closed its exhibits] on April 3, 2011, and reopened in a new building on September 15, 2011.

==Holdings==
===Major Collections===
The NMHM embodies five collections consisting of about 25 million artifacts, including 5,000 skeletal specimens, 8,000 preserved organs,<ref>http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/about/faq/index.html#5.3</ref> 12,000 items of medical equipment, an archive of historic medical documents, and collections related to [[neuroanatomy]] and [[developmental anatomy]]. The museum's most famous artifacts relate to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his assassination on April 14, 1865<ref>http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/exhibits/nationswounds/lincoln.html</ref> by [[John Wilkes Booth]]. On display are a copy by sculptor [[Avarel Fairbanks]] of Lincoln's life mask and hands made by [[Leonard Volk]] in 1860, the bullet fired from the [[Deringer]] pistol which ended the President's life, the probe used by the US Army Surgeon General to locate the bullet during autopsy, pieces of Lincoln's hair and skull, and the autopsy surgeon's shirt cuff, stained with Lincoln's blood.<ref>http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/exhibits/exhibits.html#indefinitely</ref> In 2010, the heirs of American pathologist [[Thomas Stoltz Harvey|Thomas Harvey]] (1912–2007) transferred all of his holdings constituting the remains of [[Albert Einstein's brain]] to the NMHM, including 14 photographs of the whole brain (which is now in fragments) never before revealed to the public.<ref>[[Dean Falk|Falk, Dean]], Frederick E. Lepore, and Adrianne Noe (2012), [http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/11/14/brain.aws295.abstract?sid=61ec1e5c-7272-420d-a273-68f49981d0b7 “The cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein: a description and preliminary analysis of unpublished photographs”], ''[[Brain (journal)|Brain]]'';  135: 11.</ref><ref>Balter, Michael, "Rare photos show that Einstein's brain has unusual features", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Tuesday, 27 November 2012; E6.</ref>
