==Outbreak==
In late January 1976 a number of recruits at [[Fort Dix]] in [[New Jersey]] began to complain of respiratory illness, on February 5, 1976, David Lewis, an [[United States Army|Army]] [[private (rank)|private]] said he felt tired and weak. Private Lewis then left his sick bed to go on a forced run, collapsed, was revived by his Sergeant only to die a few days later and four of his fellow soldiers were additionally hospitalized. Two weeks after his death, health officials announced that [[swine flu]] was the cause of death and that this strain of flu appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. Alarmed public-health officials decided that action must be taken to head off another major [[Influenza pandemic|pandemic]], and they urged President [[Gerald Ford]] that every person in the U.S. be vaccinated for the disease' despite prior knowledge that one version of the vaccine could cause neurological damage.<ref name="cbs60minutesswineflu">{{cite web|title=CBS 60 Minutes "Swine Flu"|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9mh9f_swine-flu-1976-propaganda_webcam|accessdate= 28 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

==Reported vaccine side effects==
There were multiple reports of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS), a paralyzing [[neuromuscular]] disorder, affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations. One of the causes of this syndrome could be a rare side-effect of modern influenza vaccines, with an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vellozzi C, Burwen DR, Dobardzic A, Ball R, Walton K, Haber P |title=Safety of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines in adults: Background for pandemic influenza vaccine safety monitoring |journal=Vaccine |volume=27 |issue=15 |pages=2114–2120 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19356614 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.01.125}}</ref> Guillain–Barré syndrome naturally occurs at a rate of 6-40 per million people per year,<ref name="Pithadia">{{Cite journal| author = Pithadia AB, Kakadia N. | title = Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). | language = | journal = Pharmacol Rep | volume = 62| issue = 2 | pages = 220–32 | year = 2010 | month = March–April | pmid = 20508277 | doi = | url = http://www.if-pan.krakow.pl/pjp/pdf/2010/2_220.pdf | issn = }}</ref> implying an increased risk of between 2.5%-25% over the base rate.

Claims exist that about 500 cases of GBS were caused by the vaccine, and that these cases resulted in death from severe pulmonary complications for 25 people. These are claimed to have been caused by an immunopathological reaction to the 1976 vaccine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{Dubious|date=January 2010}} Other influenza vaccines have not been linked to GBS, though caution is advised for certain individuals, particularly those with a history of GBS.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Vaccines and guillain-barré syndrome|author=Haber P, Sejvar J, Mikaeloff Y, Destefano F|journal=Drug Saf|year=2009|volume=32|issue=4 |pages=309–323|doi=10.2165/00002018-200932040-00005|pmid=19388722}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Influenza / Flu Vaccine|url=http://www.uis.edu/healthservices/immunizations/influenzavaccine.html|publisher=University of Illinois at Springfield|accessdate=26 April 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090429231042/http://www.uis.edu/healthservices/immunizations/influenzavaccine.html|archivedate=29 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref> According to [[Harvey Fineberg]] and [[Richard Neustadt]], authors of ''The Swine Flu Affair'', the risk of developing GBS was roughly 11 times greater with vaccination than without, though still a remote risk, affecting approximately 1 in 105,000 individuals.<ref name="USA Today"/>

==Aftermath==
The relatively benign disease outbreak and the subsequent vaccine reactions produced some political and sociological repercussions. In part, some of the political failures of the vaccination program have been attributed to the political climate associated with President Ford's re-election campaign in 1976.<ref name=TIME/><ref name="SF Gate"/>

President Ford offered vaccine manufacturers [[indemnity]],<ref name=TIME/> and the [[United States Congress]] "rushed" indemnity legislation that has been characterized as "faulty and "haphazard".<ref name="SF Gate">{{cite news|title=When politics and swine flu infect health|author=Stephanie Beck|url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/When-politics-and-swine-flu-infect-health-3243724.php|newspaper=[[SF Gate]]|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}</ref>
