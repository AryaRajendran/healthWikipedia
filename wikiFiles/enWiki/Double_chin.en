A '''double chin''' is a layer of [[subcutaneous fat]] around the [[neck]] that sags down and creates a [[wrinkle]], making the owner appear to have a second [[chin]]. It is most common on people who are elderly or [[obese]].  A person of average weight can bear a double chin as well, depending on their bone structure, amount of loose skin, and amount of fat cells in that region.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  It is more visible when the bottom [[jaw]] is lowered or the head is tilted down.

==Treatment==
A [[cosmetic surgeon]] can remove the fat pad under the chin and shorten the muscles under the jaw to remove the double chin.  This procedure involves a small horizontal cut under the double chin to remove the fat beneath the skin.  Afterwards, a vertical incision between the layers of the neck and jaw muscle is made.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  The edges are sewn together to shorten, and therefore tighten, the muscle layer. As with any surgery, complications may arise.  Such surgery is a relatively painless and moderately priced procedure.
