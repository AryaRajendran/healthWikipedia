'''Blind loop syndrome''', also known as '''Stagnant loop syndrome''', is a medical condition that occurs when the [[intestine]] is obstructed, slowing or stopping the progress of digested food, and thus facilitating the growth of [[bacteria]] to the point that problems in [[nutrient]] absorption occur.

==Pathology==
The obstruction of a section of intestine causes ineffective [[bile salt]] mediated digestion of fats, causing fatty stools and poor absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. [[vitamin B12 deficiency|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]] may occur because the increased bacterial population can consume the vitamin.

==Causes==
Blind loop syndrome is a complication of surgical operations of the abdomen, as well as [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or [[scleroderma]]. Another cause is jejunoileal diverticula<ref>Sabiston textbook of surgery board review, 7th edition. Chapter 42 small intestine, question 14</ref>

==Symptoms==
* Loss of appetite
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Fullness after a meal
* Fatty stools
* Unintentional weight loss
* Generalised weakness
==Signs and tests==
A physical examination may reveal a mass or distention of the abdomen.

Tests which may be useful for diagnosis include:

* Abdominal x-ray
* Abdominal CT scan
* Contrast enema study

==Treatment==
The initial treatment generally involves antibiotics for the bacterial overgrowth, along with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation. If antibiotics are not successful, surgical correction of the obstruction to allow better flow of food through the intestine may be considered.
