'''Vaginitis''' is an inflammation of the [[vagina]].<ref name=Vaginal Health Orginization>Vaginal Health Organization (2010) [http://www.yeastinfection.vg/ Vaginal Yeast Infections — Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention] July 10, 2010; account suspended as of November 5, 2010</ref><ref name=mayoclinic>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vaginitis/DS00255 www.mayoclinic.com — Diseases and Conditions — Vaginitis — Basics — Definition] Feb. 6, 2009</ref> It can result in [[vaginal discharge|discharge]], itching and pain,<ref name=mayoclinic/> and is often associated with an irritation or infection of the [[vulva]]. It is usually due to infection.<ref name=freemd>[http://www.freemd.com/vaginitis/ FreeMD — Vaginitis Definition] Last Updated: Jun 30, 2009</ref> The three main kinds of vaginitis are [[bacterial vaginosis]] (BV), vaginal candidiasis, and [[trichomoniasis]].<ref name="TrichomoniasisGale">"Trichomoniasis." Gale: Contemporary Women's Issues. HealthyWomen, Dec. 2010. Web. 7 Apr. 2011.</ref> A woman may have any combination of vaginal infections at one time. The symptoms that arise vary with the infection, although there are general symptoms that all vaginitis infections have and infected women may also be asymptomatic. Testing for vaginal infections is not a part of routine pelvic exams; therefore, women should neither assume their health care providers will know of the infection, nor that they will provide appropriate treatment without their input.<ref name="TrichomoniasisGale"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
A woman with this condition may have [[itching]] or [[burning]] and may notice a [[Vaginal discharge|discharge]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Egan ME, Lipsky MS |title=Diagnosis of vaginitis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=1095–104 |year=2000 |pmid=10997533 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000901/1095.html}}</ref> The following symptoms may indicate the presence of infection, which should be followed up with a professional health care practitioner for diagnosis and treatment: <ref name="TrichomoniasisGale" />       

*irritation and/or itching of the genital area
*inflammation (irritation, redness, and swelling caused by the presence of extra immune cells) of the labia majora, labia minora, or perineal area
*vaginal discharge
*foul vaginal odor
*pain/irritation with sexual intercourse

==Causes==
Vulvovaginitis can affect women of all ages and is very common. Specific forms of vaginitis are:

=== Infection===
Infectious vaginitis accounts for 90% of all cases in reproductive age women and is represented by the triad:
* [[Candidiasis]]: vaginitis caused by ''[[Candida albicans]]'' (a yeast).
* [[Bacterial vaginosis]]: vaginitis caused by ''[[Gardnerella]]'' (a bacterium).

Other less common infections are caused by [[gonorrhea]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', [[herpes]], ''[[Campylobacter]]'', [[Hygiene|improper hygiene]], and some [[parasitism|parasites]], notably ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Tori |last=Hudson |title=Women's Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-07-146473-5 }}</ref>

Vaginal infection are often (varies between countries between 20 to 40% of vaginal infections) a mix of various etiologies, which present challenging cases for treatment.  Indeed, when only one cause is treated, the other pathogens can gain in resistance and induce relapses and recurrences. The key factor is therefore to get a precise diagnosis and treat with broad spectrum anti-infective (often also inducing adverse effects).

Further, either a change in pH balance or introduction of foreign bacteria in the vagina can lead to infection known as vaginitis. There are physical factors that can contribute to development of infection, such as constantly wet vulva due to tight clothing, chemicals coming in contact with the vagina via scented tampons, antibiotics, birth control pills, or a diet favoring refined sugar and yeast.<ref name=Northrup10/> There is also psychological and emotional dimension to vaginitis. Dr. Christiane Northrup argues, "Some women respond to a perceived boundary violation with a vaginal infection."<ref>{{harvnb|Northrup|2010|p=298}}</ref> The two dimensions of vaginitis have important implications regarding treatment. 
<ref name=Northrup10>{{cite book |last=Northrup |first=Christiane |title=Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn= |pages=297–9 |ref=harv}}</ref>{{dubious|date=April 2013}}

'''Pre-pubescent girls''' 
* [[Bacterial vaginosis]]: vaginitis caused by ''[[Streptococcus|Streptococcus spp.]]''.
* Improper hygiene, which may introduce bacteria or other irritants from the [[Human anus|anal region]] to the vaginal area.
The pH balance in adolescent girls' bodies is not conducive to the growth of ''[[Candida albicans]]'', so they are unlikely to contract a yeast infection.

===Hormonal===
Hormonal vaginitis includes [[atrophy#Vaginal atrophy|atrophic]] vaginitis usually found in [[postmenopausal]] or [[postnatal|postpartum]] women. Sometimes it can occur in young girls before [[puberty]]. In these situations the [[estrogen]] support of the vagina is poor.

===Irritation/allergy===
Irritant vaginitis can be caused by allergies to [[condoms]], [[spermicide]]s, [[soaps]], [[perfumes]], [[douche]]s, [[lubricants]] and [[semen]]. It can also be caused by hot tubs, abrasion, tissue, [[tampons]] or topical medications.

===Foreign body===
Foreign body vaginitis: foreign bodies (most commonly retained tampons or condoms) cause extremely malodorous vaginal discharges. Treatment consists of removal, for which ring forceps may be useful. Further treatment is generally not necessary.

=== Diabetes ===
Women who have [[diabetes]] develop infectious vaginitis more often than women who do not.<ref>[http://diabetes.about.com/od/preventingcomplications/a/yeast.htm Yeast Infections With Diabetes - Diabetes and Yeast Infections<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Women should inform their doctors of symptoms that may indicate infection, so that a diagnosis may be made. <ref name="TrichomoniasisGale" />Diagnosis is made with [[microscopy]] (mostly by [[vaginal wet mount]]) and [[microbiological culture|culture]] of the discharge after a careful history and physical examination have been completed. The color, consistency, acidity, and other characteristics of the discharge may be predictive of the causative agent.Determining the agent is especially important because women may have more than one infection, or have symptoms that overlap those of another infection, which dictates different treatment processes to cure the infection.  <ref name="TrichomoniasisGale" /> For example, women often self-diagnose for yeast infections but due to the 89% misdiagnosis rate, self-diagnoses of vaginal infections are highly discouraged. <ref name=YeastGale/>

The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] codes for the several causes of vaginitis are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Condition
! Description
! pH
|-
| [[Candida vaginitis]] ({{ICD10|B|37|3|b|35}})
| Commonly referred to as a yeast infection, ''[[Candidiasis]]'' is a [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]] that usually causes a watery, white, cottage cheese-like vaginal discharges. The discharge is irritating to the vagina and the surrounding skin. 
| low (4.0–4.5)
|-
| [[Atrophic vaginitis]] (or Senile vaginitis) ({{ICD10|N|95|2|n|80}})
| usually causes scant vaginal discharge with no odor, dry vagina and painful intercourse.  These symptoms are usually due to decreased hormones usually occurring during and after [[menopause]].
| 
|-
| [[Bacterial vaginosis|Bacterial vaginitis]] ({{ICD10|B|96|3|b|95}}).
| ''[[Gardnerella]]'' usually causes a discharge with a fish-like odor. It is associated with itching and irritation, but not pain during intercourse. 
| elevated 
|-
| [[Trichomonas vaginalis]]  ({{ICD10|A|59|0|a|50}})
| can cause a profuse discharge with a fish-like odor, pain upon urination, painful intercourse, and inflammation of the external genitals. 
| elevated (5.0–6.0)
| 
|}

Another uncommon type of vaginitis, called desquamative inflammatory vaginitis also exists, and is underdiagnosed. The cause behind this type is still poorly understood.<ref name=Prognosis and Treatment of Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis>[http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2011/04000/Prognosis_and_Treatment_of_Desquamative.13.aspx#] "Prognosis and Treatment of Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis." Obstetrics and Gynecology. April 2011. Web. 19 March 2013.</ref>

==Complications==
Recent studies have shown that vaginal infections left untreated can lead to further complications, especially for the pregnant woman. For bacterial vaginosis, these include "premature delivery, postpartum infections, clinically apparent and subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease, [as well as] postsurgical complications (after abortion, hysterectomy, caesarian section), increased vulnerability to HIV infection and, possibly, infertility" <ref name="BacterialVaginosis">"Bacterial Vaginosis." Gale: Contemporary Women's Issues. HealthyWomen, Dec. 2010. Web. 7 Apr. 2011.</ref> Studies have also linked trichomoniasis with increased likelihood of acquiring HIV; theories include that "vaginitis increases the number of immune cells at the site of infection, and HIV then infects those immune cells." <ref name="TrichomoniasisGale"/>

Further, there are complications which lead to daily discomfort such as:

* persistent discomfort
* superficial skin infection (from scratching)
* complications of the causative condition (such as gonorrhea and candida infection) 

==Treatment==
The cause of the infection determines the appropriate treatment. It may include oral or topical antibiotics and/or antifungal creams, antibacterial creams, or similar medications. A cream containing cortisone may also be used to relieve some of the irritation. If an allergic reaction is involved, an antihistamine may also be prescribed. For women who have irritation and inflammation caused by low levels of estrogen (postmenopausal), a topical estrogen cream might be prescribed.

The following are typical treatments for trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and yeast infections:

* Trichomoniasis: Single oral doses of 2 grams of either metronidazole, or tinidazole. <ref name="TrichomoniasisGale" />

* Bacterial vaginosis: The most commonly used antibiotics are metronizadole, available in both pill and gel form, and clindamycin available in both pill and cream form. <ref name="BacterialVaginosis"/>

* Yeast infections: Local azole, in the form of ovula and cream. These anti-fungal medications, which are available in over the counter form, are generally used to treat yeast infections. Treatment may last anywhere between one, three, or seven days. <ref name=YeastGale>"Yeast Infections." Gale: Contemporary Women's Issues. HealthyWomen, Dec. 2010. Web. 7 Apr. 2011.</ref>

==Prevention==
Prevention of candidiasis, the most common type of vaginitis, starts with good hygiene: drying completely after bathing, wearing fresh undergarments, and wiping from front to rear after defecation all help to prevent contamination of the vagina with harmful bacteria. [[Douching]] is never recommended, as it often does more harm than good, by upsetting the normal balance of yeast in the vagina.<ref name=autogenerated1>Vaginal Health Organization [http://www.yeastinfection.vg How to avoid getting a Vaginal Yeast Infection] July 10, 2010</ref> Prevention of bacterial vaginosis includes healthy diets and behaviors as well as minimizing stress as all these factors can affect the pH balance of the vagina. <ref name="BacterialVaginosis" /> Consuming good bacteria in products with live-culture, such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi, or simply through probiotic supplements, one can reduce the likelihood of developing vaginitis due to antibiotics. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Prevention of trichomoniasis revolves around avoiding other people's wet towels and hot tubs, and safe-sex procedures, such as condom use. <ref name="TrichomoniasisGale"/>
