[[File:Star of life2.svg|thumb|The Star of Life]]
The '''Star of Life''' is a [[blue]], six-pointed [[star polygon|star]], outlined with a white border which features the [[rod of Asclepius]] in the center, originally designed and governed by the [[U.S.]] [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) (under the [[United States Department of Transportation]], DOT). Traditionally in the United States the logo was used as a stamp of authentication or certification for ambulances, paramedics or other EMS personnel. Internationally, it represents [[emergency medical services]] (EMS) units and personnel.

== History ==
Originally, many ambulances used a [[safety orange]] cross on a square background of reflectorized white to designate them as emergency units. This logo was used before national standards for Emergency Medical Personnel or ambulances were established. Designed by Leo R. Schwartz, Chief of the EMS Branch, [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Star of Life|url=http://www.gorhamems.org/staroflife.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070630203559/http://www.gorhamems.org/staroflife.htm|archivedate=2007-06-30|publisher=Gorham EMS|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> the Star of Life was created after the American National [[Red Cross]] complained in 1973 that the orange cross too closely resembled their logo, the red cross on a white background, its use restricted by the [[Geneva Conventions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.sd.us/dps/EMS/EMS_Main/Star.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070711171553/http://www.state.sd.us/dps/ems/EMS_Main/Star.htm|archivedate=2007-07-11|title=Star of Life - The EMS Symbol|publisher=South Dakota EMS|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> 

The newly designed Star of Life was adapted from the Medical Identification Symbol of the American Medical Association, which was trademarked by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) in 1967. The newly designed logo was trademarked on February 1, 1977 with the Commissioner of Patents and Trade-marks in the name of the National Highway Traffic Safety and Administration (registration number 1058022). The logo was "given" to the [[National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians]] (NREMT) for use as the [[emergency medical technician]]s (EMT) logo after the trademark expired in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nremt.org/about/nremt_history.asp|title=History of National Registry of EMTs|accessdate=2007-06-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070607224803/http://www.nremt.org/about/nremt_history.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-07}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=The USPTO database indicates that the registration is still valid, and neither the current version nor Wayback Machine archives of the cited URL have any mention of this 'gift' or the symbol.|reason=[[User:Peter K.

==The snake emblem==
{{main|Rod of Asclepius}}
The snake emblem is the [[Rod of Asclepius]], widely used as the symbol of medical care worldwide.  There are several theories as to its development, and it is named for the [[Greek mythology]] figure [[Asclepius]], who was said to have possessed healing power, although it has been claimed to have origins from other sources, including a biblical story from [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and as a representation of the drawing out of a [[Dracunculiasis|guinea worm]].

== Symbolism ==
The six branches of the star are symbols of the six main tasks executed by rescuers all through the emergency chain:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/co/fantasyfigures/staroflife.html|title=Star of Life|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

# '''Detection''': The first rescuers on the scene, usually untrained civilians or those involved in the incident, observe the scene, understand the problem, identify the dangers to themselves and the others, and take appropriate measures to ensure their safety on the scene (environmental, electricity, chemicals, radiation, etc.).
# '''Reporting''': The call for professional help is made and dispatch is connected with the victims, providing emergency medical dispatch.
# '''Response''': The first rescuers provide [[first aid]] and immediate care to the extent of their capabilities.
# '''On scene care''': The EMS personnel arrive and provide immediate care to the extent of their capabilities on-scene.
# '''Care in Transit''': The EMS personnel proceed to transfer the patient to a [[hospital]] via an ambulance or helicopter for specialized care. They provide medical care during the transportation.
# '''Transfer to Definitive care''': Appropriate specialized care is provided at the hospital.

== Common use ==

While no agency is tasked solely with enforcing its use as a mark of certification, the Star of Life has traditionally been used as a means of identification for medical personnel, equipment, and vehicles.
Many ambulance services mark the symbol on their vehicles, and ambulance crews often wear the design as part of their uniform.  It appears on various medical textbooks as well as on a wide range of merchandise aimed at the [[medic]] market. In hospitals and other buildings, elevators that are marked with the symbol indicate that the elevator is large enough to hold a [[stretcher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkaconsulting.com/Pages/Elevator%20Car%20Sizes.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110711172013/http://www.hkaconsulting.com/Pages/Elevator%20Car%20Sizes.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 |title=Articles:Elevator Car Sizes |publisher=Hkaconsulting.com |date=2011-07-11 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>
