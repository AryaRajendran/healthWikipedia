'''Fairbanks disease''' or '''multiple epiphyseal dysplasia''' ('''MED''') is a rare [[genetic disorder]] (dominant form—1 in 10,000 births) which affects the [[Epiphyseal plate|growing ends of bones]]. Bones usually elongate by a process that involves the depositing of [[cartilage]] at the ends of the bones, called [[ossification]]. This cartilage then [[mineralization (biology)|mineralize]]s and hardens to become bone. In MED, this process is defective.

==Inheritance==
Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) encompasses a spectrum of [[List of skeletal disorders|skeletal disorder]]s, most of which are inherited in an [[dominance relationship|autosomal dominant]] form. However, there is also an [[recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] form.

Associated genes include [[COL9A2]], [[COL9A3]], [[COMP]], and [[MATR3]].<ref name="pmid11565064">{{cite journal |author=Czarny-Ratajczak M, Lohiniva J, Rogala P, ''et al.'' |title=A mutation in COL9A1 causes multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: further evidence for locus heterogeneity |journal=Am.

== Signs and Symptoms ==
Children with autosomal dominant MED experience [[arthralgia|joint pain]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] after exercising. Their [[x-ray]]s show small and irregular ossifications centers, most apparent in the [[hip]]s and [[knee]]s. A waddling [[gait]] may develop. [[Flat feet]] are very common.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kozlowski|first=Giuseppe Canepa, Pierre Maroteaux, Vincenzo Pietrogrande ; histopatological atlas: V. Stanescu, R. Stanescu ; foreword by K.S.|title=Dysmorphic-syndromes and constitutional diseases of the skeleton : atlas with computer programme for finding symptoms and making diagnoses|year=2001|publisher=Piccin|location=Padova|isbn=978-8829915026}}</ref>  The [[Vertebral column|spine]] is normal but may have a few irregularities, such as [[scoliosis]]. There are very small capital femoral epiphyses and hypoplastic, poorly formed acetabular roofs. Knees have metaphyseal widening and irregularity while hands have [[brachydactyly]] (short fingers) and proximal metacarpal rounding. By adulthood, people with MED are of short stature or in the low range of normal and have short limbs relative to their trunks. Frequently, movement becomes limited at the major joints, especially at the elbows and hips. However, loose knee and finger joints can occur. Signs of [[osteoarthritis]] usually begin in early adulthood.<ref name="pmid15503005">{{cite journal| author=Lachman RS, Krakow D, Cohn DH, Rimoin DL| title=MED, COMP, multilayered and NEIN: an overview of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. | journal=Pediatr Radiol | year= 2005 | volume= 35 | issue= 2 | pages= 116–23 | pmid=15503005 | doi=10.1007/s00247-004-1323-4 | pmc= | url= }}</ref>

Children with recessive MED also experience joint pain, particularly of the hips and knees, but also commonly have deformities of the hands, feet, knees, or [[vertebra]]l column (like [[scoliosis]]). Approximately 50% of affected children have abnormal findings at birth (e.g., [[club foot]] or twisted metatarsals, [[cleft palate]], inward curving fingers due to underdeveloped bones and brachydactyly, or ear swelling caused by injury during birth). Height is within the normal range prior to puberty. As adults, people with recessive MED are only slightly more diminished in stature but still within the normal range. Lateral knee radiography can show multi-layered patellae.<ref name="pmid15503005"/>

==Discovery==

Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia was described separately by Ribbing and Fairbank in the 1930s.<ref name="pmid15503005"/>

In 1994, Ralph Oehlmann's group mapped MED to the peri-centromeric region of chromosome 19, using genetic linkage analysis.<ref name="pmid8279467">{{cite journal| author=Oehlmann R, Summerville GP, Yeh G, Weaver EJ, Jimenez SA, Knowlton RG| title=Genetic linkage mapping of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 19. | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year= 1994 | volume= 54 | issue= 1 | pages= 3–10 | pmid=8279467 | doi= | pmc=1918067 | url= }}</ref> Michael Briggs' group mapped PSACH to the same area.<ref name="pmid8307576">{{cite journal| author=Briggs MD, Rasmussen IM, Weber JL, Yuen J, Reinker K, Garber AP et al.| title=Genetic linkage of mild pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) to markers in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 19. | journal=Genomics | year= 1993 | volume= 18 | issue= 3 | pages= 656–60 | pmid=8307576 | doi= 10.1016/S0888-7543(05)80369-6| pmc= | url= }}</ref> COMP gene was fistly linked to MED and PSACH in 1995.<ref name="pmid7670472">{{cite journal| author=Briggs MD, Hoffman SM, King LM, Olsen AS, Mohrenweiser H, Leroy JG et al.| title=Pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia due to mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein gene. | journal=Nat Genet | year= 1995 | volume= 10 | issue= 3 | pages= 330–6 | pmid=7670472 | doi=10.1038/ng0795-330 | pmc= | url= }}</ref> Later on, in 1995, the group led by Knowlton did a "high-resolution genetic and physical mapping of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and pseudoachondroplasia mutations at chromosome 19p13.1-p12".<ref name="pmid7490089">{{cite journal| author=Knowlton RG, Cekleniak JA, Cohn DH, Briggs MD, Hoffman SM, Brandriff BF et al.| title=High-resolution genetic and physical mapping of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and pseudoachondroplasia mutations at chromosome 19p13.1-p12. | journal=Genomics | year= 1995 | volume= 28 | issue= 3 | pages= 513–9 | pmid=7490089 | doi=10.1006/geno.1995.1183 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=7490089  }}</ref> Research on COMP led to mouse models of the pathology of MED.

These patients show increased skeletal muscle stress, as indicated by the increase in myofibers with central nuclei). Myopathy in the mutant mouse results from underlying tendinopathy, because the transmission of forces is altered from the normal state. There is a higher proportion of larger diameter fibrils of collagen but the cross-sectional area of whole mutant tendons was also significantly less than that of the wild-type tendons causing joint laxity and stiffness, easy tiringness and weakness. This study is important because those diseases are often mistaken for neurological problems, since the doctor can detect a muscle weakness. This include a lot of painful and useless clinical neurological examination prior to the correct diagnosis. In this work, the researchers suggest to the pediatric doctor to perform x-rays before starting the neurological assessment, to exclude the dysplasia.<ref name="pmid19808781">{{cite journal| author=Piróg KA, Jaka O, Katakura Y, Meadows RS, Kadler KE, Boot-Handford RP et al.| title=A mouse model offers novel insights into the myopathy and tendinopathy often associated with pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. | journal=Hum Mol Genet | year= 2010 | volume= 19 | issue= 1 | pages= 52–64 | pmid=19808781 | doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp466 | pmc=2792148 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=19808781  }}</ref>

COL91A mutation was discovered in 2001.<ref name="pmid11565064">{{cite journal| author=Czarny-Ratajczak M, Lohiniva J, Rogala P, Kozlowski K, Perälä M, Carter L et al.| title=A mutation in COL9A1 causes multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: further evidence for locus heterogeneity. | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year= 2001 | volume= 69 | issue= 5 | pages= 969–80 | pmid=11565064 | doi=10.1086/324023 | pmc=1274373 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=11565064  }}</ref>

==Cause==

In the [[dominant]] form, mutations in five genes are causative: [[COMP]] ([[chromosome 19]]), [[COL9A1]] ([[chromosome 6]]), [[COL9A2]] ([[chromosome 1]]), [[COL9A3]] ([[chromosome 20]]), and [[MATN3]] ([[chromosome 2]]). However, in approximately 10%-20% of all samples analyzed, a mutation cannot be identified in any of the five genes above, suggesting that mutations in other as-yet unidentified genes are also involved in the pathogenesis of dominant MED.<ref>{{Citation
 | pmid = 20301302
}}</ref>
The [[COMP]] gene is mutated in 70% of the molecularly confirmed MED patients. Mutations are located in the exons encoding the type III repeats (exons 8-14) and C-terminal domain (exons 15-19).<ref name="pmid11968079">{{cite journal| author=Briggs MD, Chapman KL| title=Pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: mutation review, molecular interactions, and genotype to phenotype correlations. | journal=Hum Mutat | year= 2002 | volume= 19 | issue= 5 | pages= 465–78 | pmid=11968079 | doi=10.1002/humu.10066 | pmc= | url= }}</ref> The most common mutations in [[COL9A1]] are located in exons 8-10, in [[COL9A2]] in exons 2-4, and in [[COL9A3]] in exons 2-4. Altogether, those mutations cover 10% of the patients. Other 20% of affected people have mutations in MATN3 gene, all found within exon 2. In order to this findings, the following testing regime has been recommended by the [[European Skeletal Dysplasia Network]]:

* Level 1: COMP (exons 10-15) and MATN3 (exon 2)
* Level 2: COMP (exons 8 & 9 and 16-19)
* Level 3: COL9A1 (exon 8), COL9A2 and COL9A3 (exon 3)

All those genes are involved in the production of the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM). The role of [[COMP]] gene still remains unclear. It is a noncollagenous protein of the ECM.<ref name="pmid7325960">{{cite journal| author=Paulsson M, Heinegård D| title=Purification and structural characterization of a cartilage matrix protein. | journal=Biochem J | year= 1981 | volume= 197 | issue= 2 | pages= 367–75 | pmid=7325960 | doi= | pmc=1163135 | url= }}</ref>  Mutations in this gene can also cause the [[pseudoachondroplasia]] (PSACH). It should play a role in the structural integrity of cartilage via its interaction with other extracellular matrix proteins and can be part of the interaction of the chondrocytes with the matrix through. It is a potent suppressor of apoptosis in chondrocytes and can suppress
[[apoptosis]]. Another one of it roles is maintaining a vascular smooth muscle cells contractile
under physiological or pathological stimuli<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?id_type=entrezgene&id=1311|title=GeneCards}}</ref>
Since 2003, the European Skeletal Dysplasia Network has used an on-line system to do diagnose cases referred to the network prior to mutation analysis in order to study the different mutations causing PSACH or MED.<ref name="pmid21922596">{{cite journal| author=Jackson GC, Mittaz-Crettol L, Taylor JA, Mortier GR, Spranger J, Zabel B et al.| title=Pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: a 7-year comprehensive analysis of the known disease genes identify novel and recurrent mutations and provides an accurate assessment of their relative contribution. | journal=Hum Mutat | year= 2012 | volume= 33 | issue= 1 | pages= 144–57 | pmid=21922596 | doi=10.1002/humu.21611 | pmc=3272220 | url= }}</ref>

[[COL9A1]], [[COL9A2]], [[COL9A3]] are genes coding for [[collagen]] type IX, that is a component of [[hyaline cartilage]]. 
MATN3 protein may play a role in the formation of the extracellular filamentous networks and in the development and homeostasis of cartilage and bone.<ref>{{cite web|title=MATN3 review|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=full_report&list_uids=4148}}</ref>

In the [[recessive]] form, [[DTDST]] gene is mutated almost in 90% of the patients. It is also known as [[SLC26A2]]. It is a sulfate transporter, transmembrane [[glycoprotein]] implicated in several chondrodysplasias. It is important for sulfation of proteoglycans and matrix organization.<ref>{{cite web|title=SLC26A2 solute carrier family 26|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=full_report&list_uids=1836}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis should be based on the clinical and radiographic findings and a genetical analysis can be assessed.<ref>Pagon RA, Bird TD, Dolan CR, et al., editors. GeneReviews™ [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993-.</ref>

==Treatment==
Symptomatic individuals should be seen by an orthopedist in order to assess the possibility of treatment (physiotherapy for muscular strengthening, cautious use of analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Although there is no cure, surgery is sometimes used to relieve symptoms.<ref name="pmid18498631">{{cite journal |author=Trehan R, Dabbas N, Allwood D, Agarwal M, Kinmont C |title=Arthroscopic decompression and notchplasty for long-standing anterior cruciate ligament impingement in a patient with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=2 |issue= |pages=172 |year=2008 |pmid=18498631 |pmc=2412893 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-172 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2//172}}</ref> Surgery may be necessary to treat malformation of the hip (osteotomy of the pelvis or the collum femoris) and, in some cases, malformation (e.g., genu varum or genu valgum).<ref>{{cite book|last=Linden|first=Suzanne K.
