'''Seneca Valley Virus''' or '''Senecavirus'''
is a replication-competent [[oncolytic]] [[picornavirus]]. SVV-001 has selective tropism for cancers with neuroendocrine features including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and several pediatric solid tumors including retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma.<ref>{{Cite pmid|17971529|noedit}}</ref> A Phase I clinical trial of SVV-001 in adults with neuroendocrine tumors showed that SVV-001 is apparently safe to administer at doses up to 1E11 vp/kg.<ref>{{Cite pmid|21304001|noedit}}</ref>

It has potential [[antineoplastic]] activity.<ref>National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/Templates/drugdictionary.aspx?CdrID=488482 Definition of Seneca Valley virus-001].

==Discovery and Origin of Seneca Valley VIrus==

The complete genome sequence of SVV-001 was competed in 2008.<ref>{{cite pmid|18420805}}</ref>

An infectious clone of SVV-001 was reported in 2012.<ref>{{cite pmid|22971818}}</ref>

Seneca Valley virus has been proposed to attack cancer stem cells.<ref>{{cite pmid|22430386}}</ref>

Diagnostic monoclonal antibodies have been generated against Seneca Valley virus.<ref>{{cite pmid|22362934}}</ref>

It has been suggested that not enough safety information is yet available. This determination was made prior to results of the phase I clinical trial being published.<ref>{{cite pmid|21560181}}</ref>

While the sequence of SVV proteins is most similar to cardioviruses, the non-coding internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) is most similar to those of pestviruses including classical swine fever virus.<ref>{{cite pmid|21325406}}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
The initial isolate, SVV-001, is being developed as an anti-cancer therapeutic by [[virtual company]] Neotropix, Inc. under the name NTX-010.

==Virus replication==
It is believed that SVV-001 internalizes by receptor-mediated internalization, but as yet no host receptor has been identified.
