'''Uterus didelphys''' (sometimes also ''uterus didelphis'') represents a [[uterine malformation]] where the uterus is present as a paired organ as the embryogenetic fusion of the [[mullerian duct]]s failed to occur. As a result there is a '''double uterus''' with two separate [[cervix|cervices]], and often a [[double vagina]] as well. Each uterus has a single horn linked to the ipsilateral [[fallopian tube]] that faces its [[ovary]].

==Etiology==
The uterus is formed during [[embryogenesis]] by the fusion of the two [[paramesonephric duct]]s (also called mullerian ducts). This process usually fuses the two mullerian ducts into a single uterine body but fails to take place in these affected women who maintain their double mullerian systems. A  didelphic uterus will have a double [[cervix]] and is usually associated with a [[double vagina]]. Causes for the failure to fuse are not known.
Associated defects may affect the vagina, the renal system, and less commonly, the [[skeleton]].

The condition is less common than these other uterine malformations: [[arcuate uterus]], [[septate uterus]], and [[bicornuate uterus]]. It has been estimated to occur in 1/3,000 women.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grimbizis |first1=G. F. |last2=Camus |first2=M |last3=Tarlatzis |first3=BC |last4=Bontis |first4=JN |last5=Devroey |first5=P |title=Clinical implications of uterine malformations and hysteroscopic treatment results |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=161–74 |year=2001 |pmid=11284660 |doi=10.1093/humupd/7.2.161}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Women with the condition may be asymptomatic and unaware of having a double uterus. However, a study by Heinonen showed that certain conditions are more common. In his study of 26 women with a double uterus gynecological complaints included [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[dyspareunia]]. All patients displayed a double vagina. The fetal survival rate in 18 patients who delivered was 67.5%. Breech presentation was present in 43% and premature delivery common (21%).<ref name=heinonen>{{cite journal |last1=Heinonen |first1=P.K. |title=Uterus didelphys: a report of 26 cases |journal=European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=345–50 |year=1984 |pmid=6479426 |doi=10.1016/0028-2243(84)90113-8}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A pelvic examination will typically reveal a double vagina and a double cervix. Investigations are usually prompted on the basis of such findings as well as when reproductive problems are encountered. Not all cases of uterus didelphys involve duplication of the cervix and vagina.

Helpful techniques to investigate the uterine structure are [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] and [[sonohysterography]], [[hysterosalpingography]], [[MRI]], and [[hysteroscopy]]. More recently 3-D ultrasonography has been advocated as an excellent non-invasive method to evaluate uterine malformations.<ref name=woelfer>{{cite journal |last1=Woelfer |first1=B |title=Reproductive outcomes in women with congenital uterine anomalies detected by three-dimensional ultrasound screening |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=98 |pages=1099–103 |year=2001 |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01599-X |issue=6 |pmid=11755560 |last2=Salim |first2=R |last3=Banerjee |first3=S |last4=Elson |first4=J |last5=Regan |first5=L |last6=Jurkovic |first6=D}}</ref>

Uterus didelphys is often confused with a complete uterine septum. Often more than one method of investigation is necessary to accurately diagnose the condition. Correct diagnosis is crucial as treatment for these two conditions is very different.<ref name="journals.elsevierhealth.com">{{cite journal |last1=Pui |first1=M |title=Imaging diagnosis of congenital uterine malformation |journal=Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=425–33 |year=2004 |pmid=15464882 |doi=10.1016/j.compmedimag.2004.05.008}}</ref> Whereas most doctors recommend removal of a uterine septum, they generally concur that it is better not to operate on a uterus didelphys. In either case, a highly qualified reproductive endocrinologist should be consulted.

==Frequency==
In the United States, uterus didelphys is reported to occur in 0.1–0.5% of women. It is difficult to know the exact occurrence of this anomaly, as it may go undetected in the absence of medical and reproductive complications.

==Management==
Patients with a double uterus may need special attention during pregnancy as [[premature birth]] and [[malpresentation]] are common. [[Cesarean section]] was performed in 82% of patients reported by Heinonen.<ref name=heinonen/>

Uterus didelphys, in certain studies, has also been found associated with higher rate of infertility, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, and postpartum bleed.<ref name="journals.elsevierhealth.com"/>

==Syndrome==
A specific association of uterus didelphys, unilateral [[hematocolpos]] and ipsilateral renal agenesis has been described.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Madureira |first1=A. J. |last2=Mariz |first2=C. M. |last3=Bernardes |first3=J. C. |last4=Ramos |first4=I. M. |title=Case 94: Uterus Didelphys with Obstructing Hemivaginal Septum and Ipsilateral Renal Agenesis |journal=Radiology |volume=239 |issue=2 |pages=602–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16641359 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2392031187}}</ref>

==Multiple pregnancy==
A number of twin gestations have occurred where each uterus carried its pregnancy separately. A recent example occurred on February 26, 2009, when Sarah Reinfelder of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan delivered two healthy, although seven weeks premature, infants by cesarean section at Marquette General Hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j0p3-XQ5njnvqFj5KVadfD1EfNVQD96KQATO0 |title=Associated Press "Mich. woman with 2 wombs delivers twin daughters" |work=}}</ref>  It is possible that the deliveries occur at different times, thus the delivery interval could be days or even weeks.

===Triplets===
A [[United Kingdom|UK]] woman with a double uterus gave birth to [[Multiple birth|triplets]] in 2006. Hannah Kersey, of Northam in Devon, gave birth to a pair of identical twins from an egg that implanted into one womb and then divided, and to an infant from a single egg that implanted into the other womb.  This was the first known birth of viable triplets in a woman with a double uterus.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6199363.stm |title= Triplets for woman with two wombs |accessdate=2007-06-27 |work=BBC News | date=December 21, 2006}}</ref> It is estimated that the possibility of such a birth is about 1 in 25 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/13-people-with-extra-body-parts2.htm |title=Howstuffworks "13 People with Extra Body Parts" |work=}}</ref> A triplet pregnancy in a woman with uterus didelphys was reported from Israel in 1981; one baby died in utero, and of the remaining babies, one was delivered at 27 weeks gestation and the other 72 days later.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mashiach |first1=S |last2=Ben-Rafael |first2=Z |last3=Dor |first3=J |last4=Serr |first4=DM |title=Triplet pregnancy in uterus didelphys with delivery interval of 72 days |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=519–21 |year=1981 |pmid=7279347}}</ref>

==In the media==
On January 20, 2012, Hazel Jones, a 27 year old woman in England, declined a $1 million offer to appear in an adult film by [[Steven Hirsch]], founder of American adult film company [[Vivid Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2089360/Hazel-Jones-Woman-2-vaginas-rejects-1m-pornography-offer.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Maysa | last=Rawi | title='I would never consider doing it in a million years': Woman with two vaginas rejects million offer to make adult film}}</ref>
