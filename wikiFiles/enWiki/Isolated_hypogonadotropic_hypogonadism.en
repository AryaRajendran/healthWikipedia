'''Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism''' ('''IHH'''), also called '''idiopathic''' or '''congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism''' ('''CHH'''), as well as '''isolated''' or '''congenital gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency''' ('''IGD'''), is a [[medical condition|condition]] that results in a small subset of cases of [[hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] (HH) due to deficiency in or insensitivity to [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) where the function and anatomy of the [[anterior pituitary]] is otherwise normal and secondary causes of HH are not present. It presents as [[hypogonadism]] (e.g., [[delayed puberty|reduced or absent puberty]], low [[libido]], [[infertility]], etc) due to an impaired release of the [[gonadotropin]]s, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), and a resultant lack of [[sex steroid]] production by the [[gonad]]s. In addition, [[anosmia]] (loss of the sense of [[smell]]) occurs in instances of IHH that are the result of [[Kallmann syndrome]], which is responsible for approximately 50% of all cases of the condition. Other causes of IHH include [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone insensitivity|GnRH insensitivity]], which is the second most common cause of IHH and is thought to be responsible for up to 20% of cases, and a minority (less than 5-10%) due to inactivating [[genetic mutation|mutation]]s in a variety of other [[gene]]s which positively regulate GnRH secretion such as ''[[CHD7]]'', ''[[KISS1R]]'', and ''[[TACR3]]''. The causes of approximately 25% of all cases of IHH are still unknown.<ref name="NBK1278">{{cite web | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1278/ | title = Isolated Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Deficiency Overview - GeneReviews™ - NCBI Bookshelf | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref>
