'''Theobromine poisoning''' or '''chocolate poisoning''' is an overdose reaction to the [[alkaloid]] [[theobromine]], found in [[chocolate]], [[tea]], [[cola]] [[beverage]]s,<ref name="GennaroAbrigo1992">{{cite journal|last1=Gennaro|first1=M. C.|last2=Abrigo|first2=C.|title=Caffeine and theobromine in coffee, tea and cola-beverages|journal=Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry|volume=343|issue=6|year=1992|pages=523–525|issn=0937-0633|doi=10.1007/BF00322162}}</ref> [[açaí]] berries,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and some other foods. Toxic ({{LD50}}) doses of theobromine have only been published for humans, cats, dogs, rats, and mice; these differ by a factor of 6 across species (see the table in this article). The toxicity for (pet) birds is not known, but it is typically assumed that chocolate is dangerous for birds.<ref>B. Harvey, [http://www.oldworldaviaries.com/text/miscellaneous/toxicoses.html Toxicoses in Birds]. (unknown date and original publisher)</ref>

==Chocolate==
===In humans===
[[Cacao bean]]s contain about 1.2% theobromine by [[weight]], while processed chocolate, in general, has smaller amounts.  The amount found in highly refined chocolate candies (typically {{nowrap|1.4–2.1 [[Gram|g]]/[[Kilogram|kg]]}} or {{nowrap|40–60 [[milligram|mg]]}}/[[ounce|oz]]) is much lower than that of [[Types of chocolate#Classification|dark chocolate]] or unsweetened baker's chocolate ({{nowrap|> 14 g/kg}} or {{nowrap|> 400 mg/oz}}). In general, the amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough such that chocolate can be safely consumed by [[human]]s. However, occasional serious side effects may result from the consumption of large quantities, especially in the elderly.<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+7332  THEOBROMINE] from the [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]]</ref>  In extreme cases, emergency room treatment may be required.<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~Fo46AW:1:emerg Emergency treatment of theobromine poisoning], from the [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]] </ref>

===In animals===
Serious poisoning happens more frequently in domestic animals, which [[metabolize]] theobromine much more slowly than humans, and can easily consume enough chocolate to cause chocolate poisoning. If large numbers of filled chocolate candies are consumed another serious danger is posed by the fat and sugar in the fillings which can sometimes trigger life threatening pancreatitis several days later. The most common victims of theobromine poisoning are [[dog]]s,<ref name="bbc_chocwarn">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/7805430.stm |title=Dog owners get chocolate warning |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref><ref name="vetrica_pdog">{{cite web |url=http://www.vetrica.com/care/dog/chocolate.shtml |title=Chocolate Poisoning in the Dog |publisher=Vetrica |date=February 9, 2004 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref><ref name="bbc_grdog">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/7982311.stm |title=Greedy dog cheats chocolate death |publisher=BBC |date=April 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref> for which it can be fatal. The toxic dose for [[cat]]s is even lower than for dogs.  However, cats are less prone to eating chocolate since they are [[Sweetness#The sweetness receptor|unable to taste sweetness]].<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Biello |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-cats-cannot-taste-sweets |title=Strange but True: Cats Cannot Taste Sweets |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref> Theobromine is much less toxic to rats and mice, due to their relative genetic similarity to primates; they and humans all have an {{LD50}} of about 1,000&nbsp;mg/kg. 

In dogs, the [[half-life]] of theobromine is 17.5 hours; in severe cases, clinical symptoms of theobromine poisoning can persist for 72 hours.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sharon |last=Gwaltney-Brant |url=http://www.aspcapro.org/mydocuments/m-toxbrief_0201.pdf |title=Chocolate Intoxication |publisher=Veterinary Medicine Publishing Group |date=February, 2001 |accessdate=November 05, 2011}}</ref> Medical treatment performed by a [[veterinarian]] involves inducing [[vomiting]] within two hours of ingestion and administration of [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[barbiturate]]s for seizures, [[antiarrhythmic agents|antiarrhythmic]]s for [[cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmia]]s, and [[forced diuresis|fluid diuresis]]. Theobromine is also suspected to induce [[cardiomyopathy|right atrial cardiomyopathy]] after long term exposure at levels equivalent to ~15&nbsp;g of dark chocolate per kg of weight and per day.<ref>{{cite web|last=H. Gans|first=Joseph|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0041008X80903609|title=Effects of short-term and long-term theobromine administration to male dogs|publisher=Elsevier Inc|accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref> A typical {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}} dog will normally experience intestinal distress after eating less than {{convert|240|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dark chocolate, but won't necessarily experience [[bradycardia]] or [[tachyarrhythmia]] unless it eats at least {{convert|0.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of milk chocolate.  According to the [[Merck Veterinary Manual]], baker's chocolate of approximately {{nowrap|1.3 g/kg}} ({{nowrap|0.02 oz/lb}}) of a dog's body weight is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity. For example, {{convert|2.25|oz|g|adj=on}} of baker's chocolate would be enough to produce symptoms in a {{convert|20|lb|kg|adj=on}} dog; however, other types of chocolate (such as milk chocolate candies) contain significantly less theombromine and so require the dog to ingest more before showing symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |first= Salynn |last=Boyles |url=http://pets.webmd.com/dogs/guide/dogs-and-chocolate-get-the-facts |title=Dogs and Chocolate: Get the Facts |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |publisher=WebMD}}</ref>  

Chemists with the [[USDA]] are investigating the use of theobromine as a toxicant to control [[coyotes]] that prey on livestock.<ref>{{cite web |first=John J. |last=Johnston |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=icwdm_usdanwrc |title=Evaluation of Cocoa- and Coffee-Derived Methylxanthines as Toxicants for the Control of Pest Coyotes |publisher=[[Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry]] |year=2005 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The first signs of theobromine poisoning are [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], and increased [[urination]].  These can progress to cardiac [[arrhythmias]], [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[internal bleeding]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], and eventually [[death]].
