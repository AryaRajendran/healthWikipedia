'''Nasal septum deviation''' is a common physical disorder of the [[Human nose|nose]], involving a displacement of the [[nasal septum]].

==Causes==
It is most frequently caused by [[Physical trauma|impact trauma]], such as by a blow to the [[face]].<ref name=metson>

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of a deviated septum include [[infection]]s of the [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]] and [[sleep apnea]], [[snoring]], repetitive [[sneezing]], facial pain, [[nosebleed]]s, difficulty with [[breathing]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deviatedseptumsurgeon.com/deviated-septum-surgery/|title=Deviated Septum Surgery|publisher=Robert Kotler, MD, FACS|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> and mild to severe loss of the ability to [[Olfaction|smell]].<ref>http://care.american-rhinologic.org/disorders_of_smell_taste</ref>

==Presentation==
The [[nasal septum]] is the bone and cartilage in the nose that separates the [[nasal cavity]] into the two [[nostril]]s.  The cartilage is called the quadrangular cartilage and the bones comprising the septum include the maxillary crest, [[vomer]] and the perpendicular plate of the [[ethmoid]].  Normally, the septum lies centrally, and thus the nasal passages are symmetrical.<ref name=aao>

</ref> A deviated septum is an abnormal condition in which the top of the cartilaginous ridge leans to the left or the right, causing obstruction of the affected nasal passage. The condition can result in poor drainage of the [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]]. [[Patient]]s can also complain of difficulty [[breath]]ing, headaches, bloody noses, or of sleeping disorders such as [[snoring]] or [[sleep apnea]].<ref name=aao/>

It is common for nasal septa to depart from the exact centerline; the septum is only considered deviated if the shift is substantial or is adversely affecting the patient.<ref name=metson/> Many people with a deviation are unaware they have it until some [[pain]] is produced. By itself, a deviated septum can go undetected for years and thus be without any need for correction.<ref name=metson/>

Some people are concerned about diminished airflow through the effectively smaller nostril resulting from deviation.

==Treatment==
In mild cases, symptoms can simply be treated with [[medications]] such as [[decongestants]], [[antihistamines]], and [[nasal spray]]. Medication temporarily relieves symptoms, but does not correct the underlying condition.<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/deviated-septum/ds00977/dsection=treatments-and-drugs;</ref> however, a cure to symptoms related to septal deviations is available in the form of a  minor surgical procedure known as a [[septoplasty]]. The surgery is performed quickly (lasts roughly 1 hour) and does not result in any cosmetic alteration or external scars.  Recovery from the procedure may take anywhere from 2 days to 4 weeks to heal completely.<ref>http://www.californiasurgicalinstitute.com/septoplasty.html</ref> Septal bones never regrow.  However, if symptoms reappear they are not related to deviations. Reappearance of symptoms may be due to [[mucosal]] [[metaplasia]] of the nose.<ref>One study found that 26% of patients were symptom free during a follow up 9 years after the surgery http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2273.1989.tb00366.x/abstract</ref>

==Complications==
1. [[Nasal septum perforation]] : Due to bilateral trauma of the mucoperichondrial flaps opposite each other.

2. Septal [[haematoma]] and septal abscess.

3. Adhesions and synachiae: between septal mucosa and lateral nasal wall.

4. [[Saddle nose]]: Due to over resection of the dorsal wall of the [[septal cartilage]].

5. Dropped nasal tip: Due to resection of the caudal margin.
