'''Vivisection''' ({{ety|la|vivus|alive||sectio|cutting}}) is defined as [[surgery]] conducted for experimental purposes on a living organism, typically animals with a [[central nervous system]], to view living internal structure. The term is sometimes more broadly defined as any experimentation on live animals (see [[Animal testing#Definitions|animal testing]].)<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382118?query=Vivisection&ct= "Vivisection"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 2009: "Vivisection: operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals."</ref><ref name=Tansey>Tansey, E.M.

Research requiring vivisection techniques that cannot be met through other means is often subject to an external [[ethics]] review in conception and implementation, and in many jurisdictions, use of [[anesthesia]] is legally mandated for any surgery likely to cause pain to any vertebrate.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309053773 National Academy of Sciences Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals]</ref> 

In the [[United States of America|U.S.]], the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] explicitly requires that any procedure that may cause pain utilize “tranquilizers, analgesics, and anesthetics,”<ref>{{uscsub|7|2145|a|3|c|ii}}</ref> with exceptions when “scientifically necessary.”<ref>{{uscsub|7|2145|a|3|c|v}}</ref> The act does not define “scientific necessity” or regulate specific scientific procedures,<ref>http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/awa/awa.pdf</ref> but approval or rejection of individual techniques in each federally funded lab is determined on a case-by-case basis by the [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]], which contains at least one veterinarian, one scientist, one non-scientist, and one other individual from outside the university.<ref>[www.iacuc.org The Official IACUC Page]</ref>  

In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], any experiment involving vivisection must be granted a license by the [[Home Secretary]]. The [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]] “expressly directs that, in determining whether to grant a licence for an experimental project, ‘the Secretary of State shall weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue.’” 

In [[Australia]], the Code of Practice “requires that all experiments must be approved by an Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee” that includes a “person with an interest in animal welfare who is not employed by the institution conducting the experiment, and an additional independent person not involved in animal experimentation.”<ref>[[Peter Singer|Singer, Peter]]. ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]].'' Avon: New York, 1990, p. 77</ref>

Anti-vivisectionists have played roles in the emergence of the [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]] movements. Among their arguments is that it is immoral to inflict pain or injury to another living creature, for whatever purpose.<ref name=Yarri/>
