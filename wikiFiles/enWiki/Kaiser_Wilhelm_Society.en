The '''Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science''' ([[German language|German]] ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften'') was a [[Germany|German]] scientific institution established in the [[German Empire|German Kaiserreich]] in 1911. During the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] it was implicated in Nazi scientific operations, and after the [[World War II|Second World War]] was wound up, its functions being taken over by the [[Max Planck Society]]. The Kaiser Wilhelm Society was an umbrella organization for many institutes, testing stations, and research units spawned under its authority.

The Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG) was founded in 1911 in order to promote the [[natural sciences]] in Germany, by founding and maintaining research institutions formally independent from the state and its administrations. The institutions were to be under the guidance of prominent directors, which included luminaries such as [[Walther Bothe]], [[Peter Debye]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Fritz Haber]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]]; a board of trustees also provided guidance. 

Funding was ultimately obtained from sources internal and external to Germany. Internally, money was raised from individuals, industry, and the government, as well as through the [[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft]] (Emergency Association of German Science). 

External to Germany, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] granted students worldwide one year study stipends, for whichever institute they chose, some studied in Germany.<ref>Macrakis, 1993, 11-28 & 273-274.</ref><ref>Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A; see the entries for the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fluid Dynamics Research.</ref><ref>[http://www.archiv-berlin.mpg.de/eng-abteilung1.epl Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes] – Max Planck Gesellschaft Archives</ref> In contrast to the German universities with their formal independence from state administrations, the institutions of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft had no obligation to teach students.

The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and its research facilities were involved in weapons research, experimentation and production in both World War I and World War II.

==After World War II==

By the end of World War II, the KWG and its institutes had lost their central location in Berlin and were operating in other locations.  The KWG was operating out of its Aerodynamics Testing Station in [[Göttingen]].  [[Albert Vögler]], the president of the KWG, committed suicide on 14 April 1945. Thereupon, Ernst Telschow assumed the duties until [[Max Planck]] could be brought from [[Magdeburg]] to Göttingen, which was in the [[British Zone of Occupation|British zone]] of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany]].  Planck assumed the duties on 16 May until a president could be elected.  [[Otto Hahn]] was selected by directors to be president, but there were a number of difficulties to be overcome.  Hahn, being related to nuclear research had been captured by the allied forces of [[Operation Alsos]], and he was still interned at [[Farm Hall]] in England, under [[Operation Epsilon]].  At first, Hahn was reluctant to accept the post, but others prevailed upon him to accept it.  Hahn took over the presidency three months after being released and returned to Germany.  However, the [[Office of Military Government, United States]] (OMGUS) passed a resolution to dissolve the KWG on 11 July 1946.  

Meanwhile, members of the British occupation forces, specifically in the Research Branch of the OMGUS, saw the Society in a more favorable light and tried to dissuade the Americans from taking such action.  The physicist [[Howard Percy Robertson]] was director of the department for science in the British Zone; he had a National Research Council Fellowship in the 1920s to study at the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]].  Also, Colonel Bertie Blount was on the staff of the British Research Branch, and he had received his doctorate at Göttingen under Walther Borsche.  Among other things, Bertie suggested to Hahn to write to Sir [[Henry Hallett Dale]], who had been the president of the [[Royal Society]], which he did. While in England, Bertie also spoke with Dale, who came up with a suggestion.  Dale believed that it was only the name which conjured up a pejorative picture and suggested that the Society be renamed the Max Planck Gesellschaft.  On 11 September 1946, the [[Max Planck Gesellschaft]] was founded in the British Zone only. The second founding took place on 26 February 1948 for both the American and British occupation zones.  The physicists [[Max von Laue]] and [[Walther Gerlach]] were also instrumental in establishing the Society across the allied zones, including the French zone.<ref>Macrakis, 1993, 187-198.</ref><ref>Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A; see the entries for the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fluid Dynamics Research.</ref>
