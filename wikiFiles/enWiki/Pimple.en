A '''pimple''', '''zit''' or '''spot''' is a kind of [[acne]], and one of the many results of excess oil getting trapped in the pores. Some of the varieties are [[pustules]] or [[papules]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000082649|pimple}}</ref>
Pimples can be treated by various acne medications prescribed by a dermatologist, or purchased at a drug store with a wide variety of treatments.

Inside the pore are [[sebaceous gland]]s which produce [[sebum]]. When the outer layers of skin shed (as they do continuously), the dead skin cells left behind may become 'glued' together by the sebum. This causes the blockage in the pore, especially when the skin becomes thicker at [[puberty]].<ref> Anderson, Laurence. 2006. ''Looking Good, the Australian guide to skin care, cosmetic medicine and cosmetic surgery''. AMPCo. Sydney. ISBN 0-85557-044-X. </ref> The sebaceous glands produce more sebum which builds up behind the blockage, and this sebum harbours various [[bacteria]] including the species ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'', causing infection and
inflammation.

==Treatment==
{{seealso|Acne vulgaris#Management}}
===Over-the-counter medications===
Common [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medications]] for pimples are [[benzoyl peroxide]] and/or [[salicylic acid]] and antibacterial agents such as [[triclosan]]. Both medications can be found in many creams and gels used to treat acne (acne vulgaris) through topical application. Both medications help skin slough off more easily, which helps to remove bacteria faster. Before applying them the patient needs to wash his or her face with warm water and dry. A  cleanser may also be used for that purpose. Acne [[rosacea]] is not caused by bacterial infection. It is commonly treated with [[tretinoin]]. A regimen of keeping the affected skin area clean plus the regular application of these topical medications is usually enough to keep acne under control, if not at bay altogether. The most common product is a topical treatment of benzoyl peroxide, which has minimal risk apart from minor skin irritation that may present similar as a mild allergy.<ref name="Understanding Benzoyl Peroxide">{{cite web|title=Understanding Benzoyl Peroxide|url=http://www.zitfreetoday.com/understanding-benzoyl-peroxide/}}</ref> Recently [[nicotinamide]], applied topically, has been shown to be more effective in treatment of pimples than antibiotics such as [[clindamycin]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Nicotinamide]] (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) is not an antibiotic and has no side-effects typically associated with antibiotics. It has the added advantage of reducing skin hyperpigmentation which results in pimple scars.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Prescription medication===
Severe acne usually indicates the necessity of prescription medication to treat the pimples. Prescription medications used to treat acne and pimples include [[isotretinoin]], which is a [[retinoid]]. Historically, [[antibiotics]] such as [[tetracyclines]] and [[erythromycin]] were prescribed. While they were more effective than topical applications of benzoyl peroxide, the bacteria eventually grew resistant to the antibiotics and the treatments became less and less effective. Also, antibiotics had more side effects than topical applications, such as stomach cramps and severe discoloration of teeth. Common antibiotics prescribed by dermatologists include doxcycycline and minocycline.{{fact|date=June 2012}} For more severe cases of acne dermatologists might recommend [[accutane]], a retinoid that is the most potent of acne treatments. However, accutane can cause various side effects including vomitting, diarrhea, and birth defects (women).

===Hygiene===
Practicing good hygiene, including regularly washing skin areas with neutral cleansers, can reduce the amount of dead skin cells and other external contaminants on the skin that can contribute to the development of pimples.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrymore|first=John|title=Body Acne and Hygiene|url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/cleansing/tips/get-rid-of-body-acne1.htm|work=How to Get Rid of Body Acne|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> However, it isn't always possible to completely prevent pimples, even with good hygiene practices.
