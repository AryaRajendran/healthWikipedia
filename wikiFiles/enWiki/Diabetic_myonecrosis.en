'''Diabetic myonecrosis''' is a rare complication of [[diabetes]].  It is caused by [[infarcted]] [[muscle]] tissue, usually in the thigh.

==Epidemiology==
The mean age at presentation is thirty-seven years with a reported range of nineteen to sixty-four years. The mean age of onset  since diagnosis of [[diabetes]] is fifteen years. The female:male ratio is 1.3:1. Other diabetic complications such as [[nephropathy]], [[neuropathy]], [[retinopathy]] and [[hypertension]] are usually present. Its major symptom is the acute onset muscle pain, usually in the thigh, in the absence of trauma. Signs include exquisite muscle tenderness and swelling.

==Investigations and diagnosis==
Tissue [[biopsy]] is the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]].  [[Macroscopic]]ally this reveals pale muscle tissue.  [[Microscopic]]ally [[infarcted]] patches of [[myocytes]].  [[Necrotic]] muscle fibers are swollen and [[eosinophilic]] and lack striations and nuclei.  Small-vessel walls are thickened and [[hyaline|hyalinized]], with [[luminal]] narrowing or complete occlusion.  Biopsy cultures for [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[acid-fast bacilli]] and stains are negative in simple myonecrosis.
 
[[Creatine kinase]] is found to be normal.  [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] is elevated. Planar X-ray reveals soft tissue swelling and [[bone scan]] shows non specific uptake.  [[Computed tomography|CT]] shows muscle oedema with preserved tissue planes (non-contrast enhancing). [[MRI]] shows increased signal on T2 weighted images within areas of muscle oedema.  [[Arteriography]] reveals large and medium vessel arteriosclerosis occasionally with dye within the area of tissue infarction .  [[Electromyography]] shows non specific focal changes.

==Treatment==
Treatment includes supportive care with [[analgesics]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] agents. Exercise should be limited as it increases pain and extends the area of infarction. Symptoms usually resolve in weeks to months, but fifty percent of sufferers will experience relapse in either leg. The majority diagnosed with diabetic myonecrosis die within 5 years due to other diabetes complications.[http://www.metrohealth.org/documents/patient%20services/MedPeds/DiabeticMyonecrosis.pdf]

==Pathophysiology==
The pathogenesis of this disease is unclear. [[Arteriosclerosis]] obliterans has been postulated as the cause, along with errors of the [[clotting]] and [[fibrinolytic]] pathways such as [[antiphospholipid syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reyes-Balaguer J, Solaz-Moreno E, Morata-Aldea C, Elorza-Montesinos P | title = Spontaneous diabetic myonecrosis. | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 980–1 | year = 2005 | month = April | pmid = 15793211 | url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/28/4/980-a | doi = 10.2337/diacare.28.4.980-a}}</ref>

==Differential Diagnosis==
A large number of conditions may cause symptoms and signs similar to diabetic myonecrosis and include:  [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[thrombophlebitis]], [[cellulitis]], [[fasciitis]], [[abscess]], [[haematoma]], [[myositis]], [[pseudothrombophlebitis]] (ruptured synovial cyst), [[pyomyositis]], parasitic myositis, [[osteomyelitis]], calcific myonecrosis, myositis ossificans, [[diabetic myotrophy]], muscle strain or rupture, [[bursitis]], [[vasculitis]], arterial occlusion, [[haemangioma]], [[lymphoedema]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[cat-scratch disease]], [[amyloidosis]], as well as tumours of [[lipoma]], [[chondroma]], [[fibroma]], [[leiomyoma]] and [[sarcoma]].
