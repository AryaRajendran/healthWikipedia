'''Alemtuzumab''' (marketed as '''Campath''', '''MabCampath''' or '''Campath-1H''' and currently under further development as '''Lemtrada''') is a [[monoclonal antibody]] used in the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL), [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]] (CTCL) and [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma|T-cell lymphoma]].  It is also used in some conditioning regimens for [[bone marrow transplantation]], [[kidney transplantation]] and [[Islet cell transplantation]].

Alemtuzumab binds to [[CD52]], a protein present on the surface of mature [[lymphocyte]]s, but not on the [[stem cell]]s from which these lymphocytes are derived. After treatment with alemtuzumab, these CD52-bearing lymphocytes are targeted for destruction.

Alemtuzumab is used as second-line therapy for CLL. It was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] for CLL patients who have been treated with [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s and who have failed [[fludarabine]] therapy. It has been approved by [[Health Canada]] for the same indication, and additionally for CLL patients who have not had any previous therapies.

It is also used under [[clinical trial]] protocols for treatment of some [[autoimmune disease]]s, such as [[multiple sclerosis]], in which it shows promise.<ref name=MS-2008>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7680641.stm |title=Drug may reverse MS brain damage |date=22 Oct 2008 }}</ref><ref name=CARE-2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/sanofi-and-genzyme-report-new-positive-data-from-first-phase-iii-study-with-ms-drug/81245853/ |title=Sanofi and Genzyme Report New Positive Data from First Phase III Study with MS Drug |date=24 Oct 2011 }}</ref> Alemtuzumab was withdrawn from the markets in the US and Europe in 2012 to prepare for a higher-priced relaunch aimed at multiple sclerosis.<ref name=pt/>

A complication of therapy with alemtuzumab is that it significantly increases the risk for [[opportunistic infection]]s, in particular, reactivation of [[cytomegalovirus]].

== Description ==
Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that is directed against the 21â€“28 kDa cell surface glycoprotein CD52.

== Indications and use ==
Alemtuzumab is indicated for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) in patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed fludarabine therapy. It is an unconjugated antibody, thought to work via the activation of [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]](ADCC).<ref>http://www.campath.com/hcp/AboutCampath.html</ref>

== Sanofi acquisition and change of license controversy==

In February 2011, Sanofi-Aventis, since renamed [[Sanofi]], acquired [[Genzyme]], the manufacturer of alemtuzumab.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sanofi Buys Genzyme for over $20 billion| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703373404576147483489656732.html|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref>  The acquisition was delayed by a dispute between the two companies regarding the value of alemtuzumab.  The dispute was settled by the issuance of Contingent Value Rights, a type of stock warrant which pays a dividend only if alemtuzumab reaches certain sales targets.  The warrants trade on the NASDAQ-GM market with the ticker symbol GCVRZ.

In August 2012, Genzyme surrendered the licence for all presentations of alemtuzumab,<ref>{{cite web|title=Discontinuation of licensed supplies of alemtuzumab (Mabcampath)|url=http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/2012---August/10/Discontinuation-of-licensed-supplies-of-alemtuzumab-Mabcampath/|publisher=national electronic Library for Medicines|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref> pending regulatory approval to re-introduce it as a treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]].  There is concern<ref>{{cite news|title=Multiple sclerosis: New drug 'most effective'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20151891|accessdate=1 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 November 2012}}</ref> that Genzyme will later bring to market the same product at a much higher price than before.

==Research or off-label use==

===Multiple sclerosis===
In 2008 early tests at [[Cambridge University]] suggest that alemtuzumab might be useful in treating and even reversing the effects of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn15023-drug-reboots-immune-system-to-reverse-ms.html ''Drug reboots immune system to reverse MS''], Andy Coghlan, [[New Scientist]] News Service, October 23, 2008.</ref> Promising results were reported in 2011 from a phase III trial against [[Rebif]]. A combination trial with Copaxone is being considered, and is expected to work synergistically.<ref name=CARE-2011/>

===Graft-versus-host disease===
A 2009 study of alemtuzumab in 20 patients with severe steroid-resistant acute intestinal [[graft-versus-host disease]] after allogeneic [[hematopoietic cell transplantation]] (HCT) demonstrated improvement. Overall response rate was 70%, with complete response in 35%. In this study, the median survival was 280 days.  Important complications following this treatment included [[cytomegalovirus]] reactivation, bacterial infection, and invasive [[aspergillosis]] infection.<ref>[http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(09)00186-4/abstract ''Successful treatment of severe acute intestinal graft-versus-host resistant to systemic and topical steroids with alemtuzumab.''], Schnitzler M, [[Biol Blood Marrow Transplant]]. 2009 Aug;15(8):910-8.</ref>

== Contraindications and precautions ==
Alemtuzumab is contraindicated in patients who have active systemic infections, underlying immunodeficiency (e.g., seropositive for HIV), or known Type I hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions to Campath or to any one of its components.

== Adverse reactions ==
Alemtuzumab has been associated with infusion-related events including hypotension, rigors, fever, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, chills, and/or rash. In post-marketing reports, the following serious infusion-related events were reported: syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]], respiratory arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. The cardiac adverse events have resulted in death in some cases.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/diseases/articles/2005/09/17/genzyme_halts_drug_test_after_death/ ''Genzyme Halts Drug Test After Death - Three MS Patients in Campath Trial Get Blood Disorder.'']</ref>

It is also possible that perturbation of [[suppressor T cell]] populations by Campath-1H may precipitate [[autoimmune disease]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== History ==
The origins of alemtuzumab date back to '''Campath-1''' which was derived from the rat antibodies raised against human lymphocyte proteins by [[Herman Waldmann]] and colleagues in 1983.<ref>Hale G, Bright S, Chumbley G, Hoang T, Metcalf D, Munro AJ, Waldmann H. ''Removal of T cells from bone marrow for transplantation: a monoclonal antilymphocyte antibody that fixes human complement.'' Blood 1983;62:873-82. PMID 6349718.</ref> The name "Campath" derives from the ''pathology'' department of [[University of Cambridge|''Cam''bridge University]]. 

Initially, Campath-1 was not ideal for therapy because patients could, in theory, react against the foreign rat protein determinants of the antibody. To circumvent this problem, [[Greg Winter]] and his colleagues humanised Campath-1, by extracting the [[Complementarity determining region|hypervariable loops]] that had specificity for CD52 and grafting them onto a human antibody framework. This became known as Campath-1H and serves as the basis for alemtuzumab.<ref>Riechmann L, Clark M, Waldmann H, Winter G. ''Reshaping human antibodies for therapy.'' [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 1988;332:323-7. {{DOI|10.1038/332323a0}} PMID 3127726.</ref>

Campath as medication was first approved in 2001. It is marketed by [[Genzyme]], which acquired the world-wide rights from [[Bayer AG]] in 2009. Genzyme was bought by [[Sanofi]] in 2011. In August/September 2012 Campath was withdrawn from the markets in the US and Europe. This was done to prevent off-label use of the drug to treat multiple sclerosis and to prepare for a relaunch under the trade name ''Lemtrada'', with a different dosage aimed at multiple sclerosis treatment, this is expected to be much higher-priced.<ref name=pt>{{cite web|title=Sanofi withdraws Campath in US and EU|author=|date=August 21, 2012|work=Pharma Times Online|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/Article/12-08-21/Sanofi_withdraws_Campath_in_US_and_EU.aspx}}</ref>
