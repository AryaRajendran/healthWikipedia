'''''Echinostoma revolutum''''' is a [[Trematoda|fluke]] that can be a parasite in humans. It causes the disease [[echinostomiasis]].<ref name="Sohn 2011"/>

== Distribution ==
''Echinostoma revolutum'' is the most widely distributed species of all 20 Echinostomatidae species and it is found from Asia and Oceania to Europe and the Americas.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/>

Echinostomiasis is not only an endemic infectious disease in Asian countries, but also can be imported by overseas travelers from the United States or Europe.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> An outbreak of echinostomiasis was reported among US travelers returning from Kenya and Tanzania, although the source of infection was uncertain.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/>

== Description ==
The worms are leaflike, elongated, and an average of 8.8 mm long (8.0–9.5 mm) and 1.7 mm wide (1.2–2.1 mm).<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> When first passed in the feces, they were pinkish red and coiled in a "c" or "e" shape.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> The eggs in [[uteri]] were an average of 105 μm long (97–117 μm) and 63 μm wide (61–65 μm).<ref name="Sohn 2011"/>

== Life cycle==
Infection of ''Echinostoma revolutum'' usually results from ingestion of raw snails or frogs that serve as an intermediate host. This parasite is predominantly found throughout [[North America]]. Two asexual generations occur in a snail or mollusk. The first snail host is penetrated by a [[miracidium]], producing a sporocyst. Many sporocysts are produced and mother rediae emerge. Mother rediae asexually reproduce daughter rediae, which also multiply. Each rediae then develop into a cercariae, which penetrates a second host. The second host could be another snail or a tadpole, in which development into metacercaria occurs. Cercariae typically find a snail host through [[chemotaxis]]. The cercariae are attracted to the slime of the snail, which contains small peptides. The first larval stage is the miracidium, and are found to be attracted to macrocmolecular [[glycoconjugates]] associated with a possible snail host. Environmental stimuli such as light and gravity can also be used to assist in searching for a host.{{fact|date=February 2011}}

For example in [[Pursat Province]], [[Cambodia]] the children were fond of eating undercooked snails or clams of unidentified species sold on the road to their homes after school.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> It was a source of infection in humans.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/>

== Effect on human health ==
=== Prevalence ===
The first reported human infection was in [[Taiwan]] in 1929.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> The [[prevalence]] of ''Echinostoma revolutum'' flukes in Taiwan during 1929–1979 varied from 0.11% to 0.65%.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> Small ''Echinostoma revolutum''–[[endemic foci]] or a few cases of human infection were discovered in the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, and Thailand until 1994.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> However, no information is available about human ''Echinostoma revolutum'' infection after 1994, even in areas where the parasite was previously endemic.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> The prevalence of infection with ''Echinostoma revolutum'' flukes ranged from 7.5% to 22.4% in 4 schools surveyed in [[Pursat Province]], [[Cambodia]], tested fecal specimens from 471 children, 10–14 years of age, in June 2007.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> Authors reported echinostomiasis as an endemic trematode infection among schoolchildren in Pursat.<ref name="Sohn 2011"/>

===Symptoms===
{{main|echinostomiasis}}

Signs of infection in humans due to this type of fluke can result to weakness and emaciation. In cases where infection is heavy, [[hemorrhagic enteritis]] can occur.{{fact|date=February 2011}}

=== Diagnosis ===
''Echinostoma revolutum'' could be detected through observing feces containing eggs under a microscope.

=== Prevention ===
{{expand section|date=February 2011}}

=== Treatment ===
[[Albendazole]]{{fact|date=February 2011}} and [[praziquantel]]<ref name="Sohn 2011"/> are typically prescribed to rid the parasite from the body.
