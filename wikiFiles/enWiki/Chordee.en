'''Chordee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|d|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|d|eɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|k|ɔr|ˈ|d|iː}}, or {{IPAc-en|k|ɔr|ˈ|d|eɪ}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989, as {{IPA|/'kɔ:ɹdi:/}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chordee Entry "chordee"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>) is a condition in which the head of the [[penis]] curves downward or upward, at the junction of the head and shaft of the penis. The curvature is usually most obvious during [[erection]], but resistance to straightening is often apparent in the flaccid state as well. In many cases but not all, chordee is associated with [[hypospadias]]. This is not the same condition as [[Peyronie's disease]], which involves curvature of the shaft of the penis most commonly due to injury during adult life.

==Cause==
A chordee may be caused by an underlying condition, such as a [[disorder of sex development]] or an [[intersex|intersex condition]], or form as a complication of [[circumcision]],<ref>{{Citation  | doi =   10.1542/peds.103.3.686  | last =   | first =   | author-link =   | last2 =   | first2 =   | author2-link =   | title = AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS: Circumcision Policy Statement  | date = 3 March 1999  | year =   | url = http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686  | accessdate = 19 August 2010  | journal = Pediatrics  | volume = 103  | issue = 3  | pages = 686–693  | pmid =   10049981}}</ref><ref>{{Citation  | last = Kaplan, M.D  | first = George W  | author-link =   | last2 =   | first2 =   | author2-link =   | title = Complications of Circumcision  | date = August 1983  | year =   | url = http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/kaplan/  | accessdate =   | journal = Urologic Clinics of North America  | volume = 10  | issue = 3  | pages = Pages 543–549}}</ref> though some medical professionals do not consider it to be true chordee because the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corporal]] bodies are normally formed.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Complications of Circumcision | url=http://newborns.stanford.edu/CircComplications.html |accessdate = 19 August 2010 }}</ref>  However, not all congenital chordee includes abnormal corpora, and case reports of damage to the corpus cavernosum from circumcision are noted in the literature; particularly as a complication of local anesthetic.<ref>{{Citation  | doi = 10.1001/jama.241.24.2635  | last = Palmer, MD  | first = John M  |  last2 = Link, MD  | first2 = Daniel  | title = Impotence Following Anesthesia for Elective Circumcision  | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association  | volume = 241  | issue =   24| pages = 2635–2636  | date = June 15, 1979  | origyear = 1979  | url = http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/palmer/  | pmid = 439362  }}</ref>

==Presentation==
It is usually considered a [[congenital malformation]] of unknown cause. Since at an early stage of fetal development the penis is curved downward, it has been proposed that chordee results from an arrest of penile development at that stage.  

The curvature of a chordee can involve
#tethering of the skin with [[urethra]] and corpora of normal size;
#curvature induced by [[fibrosis]] and contracture of the [[fascia]]l tissue ([[Buck's fascia]] or [[dartos]]) surrounding the urethra;
#disproportionately large corpora in relation to the urethral length without other demonstrable abnormality of either; or
#a short, fibrotic urethra that tethers the penis downward (the least common type).

Severe degrees of chordee are usually associated with [[hypospadias]], but mild degrees of curvature may occur in many otherwise normal males. When the curved penis is small and accompanied by hypospadias, deficiency of prenatal androgen effect can be inferred.

==Treatment==
The principal treatment of chordee is surgery in infancy,<ref name="pmid17707021">{{Citation |author=Braga LH, Pippi Salle JL, Dave S, Bagli DJ, Lorenzo AJ, Khoury AE |title=Outcome analysis of severe chordee correction using tunica vaginalis as a flap in boys with proximal hypospadias |journal=J.

With chordees caused by circumcision, the preferred method of surgical treatment is a [[z-plasty]].<ref>Kaplan GW. Complications of circumcision.
