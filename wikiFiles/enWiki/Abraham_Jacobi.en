==Biography==
Born in Hartum (now a district of [[Hille, Germany|Hille]]), [[Westphalia]]. He was the son of a poor [[Jew]]ish shopkeeper and his wife<ref name="anb">{{Cite ANB|Jacobi, Abraham|volume=11|pages=782–784|author=Lawrence M. Gartner}}</ref> who educated him at great sacrifice.<ref name="dab">{{Cite DAB|Jacobi, Abraham|volume=V, Part 1|pages=563–564|author=Edward Preble}}</ref> He attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Minden]]. After graduating there, he studied medicine at the universities of [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], receiving an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] at Bonn in 1851. Shortly thereafter, Jacobi joined the revolutionary movement in [[Germany]] (see [[Revolution of 1848]]). He was detained in prisons at [[Berlin]] and [[Cologne]] in 1851, and eventually convicted of [[treason]] and imprisoned at Minden and [[Bielefeld]] until his discharge in the summer of 1853. Upon release, Jacobi sailed to [[England]] and then in the following autumn to [[New York]] where he settled as a practicing [[physician]].

Starting in 1861 at the [[New York Medical College]], he was a professor of childhood diseases. From 1867 to 1870, he was chair of the medical department of the [[City University of New York]]. He taught at [[Columbia University]] from 1870 to 1902. He later moved to [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], where he established the first Department of Pediatrics at a general hospital.

He was president of the New York Pathological and Obstetrical Societies, and twice of the Medical Society of the County of New York, visiting physician to the German Hospital beginning 1857, to [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] beginning 1860, to the [[Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York|Hebrew Orphan Asylum]] and the infant hospital on [[Randall's Island]] beginning 1868, and to [[Bellevue Hospital]] beginning 1874. In 1882 he was president of the New York State Medical Society, and in 1885 became president of the [[New York Academy of Medicine]]. From 1868 to 1871, he was joint editor of the ''American Journal of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children''.

Civic work was an important part of his life.  He advocated [[birth control]] and [[civil service reform (disambiguation)|civil service reform]] and opposed [[prohibition]].  He was strongly anti-[[Hohenzollern]] during [[World War I]].<ref name="dab"/> In the summer of 1918, a house fire destroyed the manuscript of his autobiography and other personal papers at his [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George]] home.  

He died on July 10, 1919 in his Summer home in [[Bolton Landing]] at age 89.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Dr. Abraham Jacobi Dies Suddenly At 89.
