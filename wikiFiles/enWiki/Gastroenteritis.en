'''Gastroenteritis'''  is a medical condition characterized by [[inflammation]] (''"-itis"'') of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] that involves both the [[stomach]] (''"gastro"''-) and the [[small intestine]] (''"entero"''-), resulting in some combination of [[diarrhea]], [[vomiting]], and [[abdomen|abdominal]] pain and cramping.<ref name=EBMED2010>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=Amandeep|title=Pediatric Emergency Medicine Practice Acute Gastroenteritis — An Update|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|year=2010|month=July|volume=7|issue=7|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=229}}</ref> Gastroenteritis has also been referred to as '''gastro''', '''stomach bug''', and '''stomach virus'''. Although unrelated to [[influenza]], it has also been called '''stomach flu''' and '''gastric flu'''.

<!--Cause  -->

Less common causes include other bacteria (or their toxins) and parasites. Transmission may occur due to consumption of improperly prepared foods or contaminated water or via close contact with individuals who are infectious.

<!--Treatment and epidemiology  -->
The foundation of management is adequate hydration. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved via [[oral rehydration solution]]. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Gastroenteritis primarily affects children and those in the developing world.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Bristol stool chart.svg|thumb|Type 7 on the [[Bristol Stool Scale|Bristol Stool Chart]] indicates diarrhea]] 
Gastroenteritis typically involves both [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]],<ref name=Eck2011/> or less commonly, presents with only one or the other.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Abdominal cramping may also be present.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72&nbsp;hours after contracting the infectious agent.<ref name=Web09>{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Roger|title=Communicable disease epidemiology and control : a global perspective|year=2009|publisher=Cabi|location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire|isbn=978-1-84593-504-7|page=79|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=pZ9fpHtvOGYC&pg=PA79|edition=3rd}}</ref> If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week.<ref name=Eck2011/> Some viral causes may also be associated with [[fever]], fatigue, [[headache]], and [[myalgia|muscle pain]].<ref name=Eck2011/> If the [[dysentery|stool is bloody]], the cause is less likely to be viral<ref name=Eck2011/> and more likely to be bacterial.<ref name=Bact2007/> Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.<ref name=Bact2007/>

[[Reactive arthritis]] occurs in 1% of people following infections with ''Campylobacter'' species, and [[Guillain-Barre syndrome]] occurs in 0.1%.<ref name=Bact2007/> [[Hemolytic uremic syndrome]] (HUS) may occur due to infection with [[Shiga toxin]]-producing ''Escherichia coli'' or ''Shigella'' species, causing [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet counts]], [[renal failure|poor kidney function]], and [[hemolytic anemia|low red blood cell count (due to their breakdown)]].<ref name=BMJ2007/> Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults.<ref name=M93/> Some viral infections may produce [[Benign infantile epilepsy|benign infantile seizures]].<ref name=EBMED2010/>

==Cause==
[[Viruses]] (particularly [[rotavirus]]) and the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]'' species are the primary causes of gastroenteritis.<ref name=Sz2010/><ref name=Web09/> There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome.<ref name=M93/> Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they are less likely than a viral or bacterial cause.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and relatively poor hygiene.<ref name=EBMED2010/>

===Viral===
[[Rotavirus]], [[norovirus]], [[adenovirus]], and [[astrovirus]] are known to cause [[viral gastroenteritis]].<ref name=Eck2011>{{cite journal |author=Eckardt AJ, Baumgart DC |title=Viral gastroenteritis in adults |journal=Recent Patents on Anti-infective Drug Discovery |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=54–63 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21210762}}</ref><ref name="pmid21173676">{{cite journal |author=Dennehy PH |title=Viral gastroenteritis in children |journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=63–4 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21173676 |doi=10.1097/INF.0b013e3182059102}}</ref> Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children,<ref name=Sz2010/> and produces similar incidence rates in both the [[developed world|developed]] and [[developing world]].<ref name=Rota2011/> Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group.<ref name=Webb2005>{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=A|coauthors=Starr, M|title=Acute gastroenteritis in children.|journal=Australian family physician|date=April 2005 |volume=34|issue=4|pages=227–31|pmid=15861741}}</ref> Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity.<ref name=ID2011>{{cite journal |author=Desselberger U, Huppertz HI |title=Immune responses to rotavirus infection and vaccination and associated correlates of protection |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=203 |issue=2 |pages=188–95 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21288818 |pmc=3071058 |doi=10.1093/infdis/jiq031 |url=}}</ref>

Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks.<ref name=Eck2011/> These localized [[epidemic]]s typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on [[cruise ships]],<ref name=Eck2011/> in hospitals, or in restaurants.<ref name=EBMED2010/> People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended.<ref name=Eck2011/> Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.<ref name=EBMED2010/>

===Bacterial===
[[File:Salmonella Typhimurium Gram.jpg|thumb|''Salmonella enterica'' serovar Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) as seen with a microscope at 1000 fold magnification and following Gram staining.]]
In the developed world ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' is the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to [[poultry]].<ref name=Bact2007>{{cite journal|last=Galanis|first=E|title=Campylobacter and bacterial gastroenteritis.|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association |date=11 September 2007 |volume=177|issue=6|pages=570–1|pmid=17846438|doi=10.1503/cmaj.070660|pmc=1963361}}</ref> In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', and ''Campylobacter'' species.<ref name=Webb2005/> If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food.<ref name=M93/> Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, [[poultry]], seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nyachuba|first=DG|title=Foodborne illness: is it on the rise?|journal=Nutrition Reviews|date=May 2010 |volume=68|issue=5|pages=257–69|pmid=20500787|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00286.x}}</ref> In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, [[cholera]] is a common cause of gastroenteritis.<!-- <ref name=Cholera11/> --> This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.<ref name=Cholera11>{{cite journal|last=Charles|first=RC|coauthors=Ryan, ET|title=Cholera in the 21st century.|journal=Current opinion in infectious diseases|date=October 2011 |volume=24|issue=5|pages=472–7|pmid=21799407|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834a88af}}</ref>

===Parasitic===
A number of [[Protozoa|protozoans]] can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' – but ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' species have also been implicated.<ref name=Webb2005/> As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children.<ref name=BMJ2007/> ''Giardia'' occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere.<ref name=Giar2010>{{cite journal|last=Escobedo|first=AA|coauthors=Almirall, P, Robertson, LJ, Franco, RM, Hanevik, K, Mørch, K, Cimerman, S|title=Giardiasis: the ever-present threat of a neglected disease.|journal=Infectious disorders drug targets|date=October 2010 |volume=10|issue=5|pages=329–48|pmid=20701575}}</ref> It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend [[day care]], men who have sex with men, and following [[disasters]].<ref name=Giar2010/>

===Transmission===
Transmission may occur via consumption of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects.<ref name=Web09/> In places with wet and dry seasons, water quality typically worsens during the [[wet season]], and this correlates with the time of outbreaks.<ref name=Web09/> In [[Temperateness|areas of the world with seasons]], infections are more common in the winter.<ref name=M93/> [[Bottle-feeding]] of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale.<ref name=Web09/> Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children,<ref name=Eck2011/> in crowded households,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grimwood|first=K|coauthors=Forbes, DA|title=Acute and persistent diarrhea.|journal=Pediatric clinics of North America|date=December 2009 |volume=56|issue=6|pages=1343–61|pmid=19962025|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2009.09.004}}</ref> and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status.<ref name=M93/> After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as [[natural reservoirs]] of contagion.<ref name=M93/> While some agents (such as ''Shigella'') only occur in [[primates]], others may occur in a wide variety of animals (such as ''Giardia'').<ref name=M93/>

===Non-infectious===
There are a number of non-infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Some of the more common include medications (like [[NSAIDs]]), certain foods such as [[lactose]] (in those who are intolerant), and [[gluten]] (in those with [[celiac disease]]). [[Crohn's disease]] is also a non-infection source of (often severe) gastroenteritis.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Disease secondary to [[toxin]]s may also occur. Some food related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: [[Ciguatera|ciguatera poisoning]] due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, [[scombroid]] associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, [[Tetrodotoxin#Poisoning|tetrodotoxin poisoning]] from the consumption of [[puffer fish]] among others, and [[botulism]] typically due to improperly preserved food.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=DT|coauthors=Dobmeier, SG; Bechtel, LK; Holstege, CP|title=Food poisoning.|journal=Emergency medicine clinics of North America|date=May 2007 |volume=25|issue=2|pages=357–73; abstract ix|pmid=17482025|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2007.02.014}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Gastroenteritis is defined as [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]] due to infection of the [[small bowel|small]] or [[large bowel]].<ref name=M93>{{harvnb|Mandell|2010|loc=Ch. 93}}</ref> The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory.<ref name=M93/> The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for ''Cryptosporidium'') to as many as 10<sup>8</sup> (for ''Vibrio cholerae'').<ref name=M93/>

==Diagnosis==
Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.<ref name=Eck2011/> Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of the condition.<ref name=Web09/> However, [[stool culture]]s should be performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have been exposed to [[food poisoning]], and those who have recently traveled to the developing world.<ref name=Webb2005/> Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance.<ref name=Eck2011/> As [[hypoglycemia]] occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum [[glucose]] in this population is recommended.<ref name=Tint10/> [[Electrolytes]] and [[creatinine|kidney function]] should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.<ref name=Webb2005/>

===Dehydration===
A determination of whether or not the person has [[dehydration]] is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases.<ref name=EBMED2010/> In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged [[capillary refill]], poor [[skin turgor]], and abnormal breathing.<ref name=Tint10/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=MJ|coauthors=DeWalt, DA, Byerley, JS|title=Is this child dehydrated?|journal=JAMA : the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=9 June 2004 |volume=291|issue=22|pages=2746–54|pmid=15187057|doi=10.1001/jama.291.22.2746}}</ref> Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth.<ref name=EBMED2010/> A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring.<ref name=Tint10/> Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration.<ref name=EBMED2010/>

===Differential diagnosis===
Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include [[appendicitis]], [[volvulus]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, and [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=Webb2005/> Pancreatic insufficiency, [[short bowel syndrome]], [[Whipple's disease]], [[coeliac disease]], and [[laxative]] abuse should also be considered.<ref name="Oxford">{{cite book |editor=Warrell D.A., Cox T.M., Firth J.D., Benz E.J. |title=The Oxford Textbook of Medicine |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-262922-0 |edition=4th |url=http://otm.oxfordmedicine.com/ }}</ref> The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits ''only'' vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).<ref name=EBMED2010/>

Appendicitis may present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases.<ref name=EBMED2010/> This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Classical [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea.<ref name=EBMED2010/> One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.<ref name=EBMED2010/>

==Prevention==
[[File:RotavirusV2009.gif|thumb|Percentage of rotavirus tests with positive results, by surveillance week, United States, July 2000 – June 2009.]]

===Lifestyle===
A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.<ref name=M93/> Personal measures (such as [[hand washing]]) have been found to decrease incidence and prevalence rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.<ref name=Tint10/> Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.<ref name=Tint10/> [[Breastfeeding]] is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.<ref name=Web09/> Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.<ref>{{cite web|title=Viral Gastroenteritis|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/faq.htm|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2012|month=February|year=2011}}</ref>

Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication.<ref name=NICE2009/> The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate [[dehydration]] is [[oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT).<ref name=BMJ2007>{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=EJ|title=Acute gastroenteritis in children.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=6 January 2007 |volume=334|issue=7583|pages=35–40|pmid=17204802|doi=10.1136/bmj.39036.406169.80|pmc=1764079}}</ref> [[Metoclopramide]] and/or [[ondansetron]], however, may be helpful in some children,<ref name="Alhashimi2009">{{cite journal |author=Alhashimi D, Al-Hashimi H, Fedorowicz Z |editor1-last=Alhashimi |editor1-first=Dunia |title=Antiemetics for reducing vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD005506 |year=2009 |pmid=19370620|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005506.pub4 }}</ref> and [[butylscopolamine]] is useful in treating [[abdominal pain]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tytgat GN |title=Hyoscine butylbromide: a review of its use in the treatment of abdominal cramping and pain |journal=Drugs |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=1343–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17547475 }}</ref>

=== Rehydration ===
The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is [[rehydration]]. This is preferably achieved by oral rehydration therapy, although [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] delivery may be required if a there is a [[decreased level of consciousness]] or if dehydration is severe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1039 |title=BestBets: Fluid Treatment of Gastroenteritis in Adults }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Canavan A, Arant BS |title=Diagnosis and management of dehydration in children |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=80 |issue=7 |pages=692–6 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19817339 }}</ref> Oral replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gregorio GV, Gonzales ML, Dans LF, Martinez EG |editor1-last=Gregorio |editor1-first=Germana V |title=Polymer-based oral rehydration solution for treating acute watery diarrhoea |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD006519 |year=2009 |pmid=19370638 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006519.pub2 }}</ref> Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as [[soft drinks]] and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may ''increase'' diarrhea.<ref name=NICE2009/> Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable.<ref name=NICE2009/> A [[nasogastric tube]] can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.<ref name=Webb2005/>

===Dietary===
It is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion,  and that formula-fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT.<ref name=MMWR2003/> Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas usually are not necessary.<ref name=MMWR2003/> Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in [[simple sugar]]s should be avoided.<ref name=MMWR2003/> The [[BRAT diet]] (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea) is no longer recommended, as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding.<ref name=MMWR2003>{{cite journal |author=King CK, Glass R, Bresee JS, Duggan C |title=Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=52 |issue=RR-16 |pages=1–16 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14627948 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5216a1.htm}}</ref> Some [[probiotics]] have been shown to be beneficial in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allen SJ, Martinez EG, Gregorio GV, Dans LF |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Stephen J |title=Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=11 |issue= 11|pages=CD003048 |year=2010 |pmid=21069673 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3 }}</ref> They may also be useful in preventing and treating [[antibiotic associated diarrhea]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hempel|first=S|coauthors=Newberry, SJ; Maher, AR; Wang, Z; Miles, JN; Shanman, R; Johnsen, B; Shekelle, PG|title=Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=9 May 2012 |volume=307|issue=18|pages=1959–69|pmid=22570464|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.3507}}</ref> Fermented milk products (such as [[yogurt]]) are similarly beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mackway-Jones|first=Kevin|title=Does yogurt decrease acute diarrhoeal symptoms in children with acute gastroenteritis?|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1000|work=BestBets|month=June|year=2007}}</ref> [[Zinc]] supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Telmesani|first=AM|title=Oral rehydration salts, zinc supplement and rota virus vaccine in the management of childhood acute diarrhea.|journal=Journal of family and community medicine|date=May 2010 |volume=17|issue=2|pages=79–82|pmid=21359029|doi=10.4103/1319-1683.71988|pmc=3045093}}</ref>

===Antiemetics===
[[Antiemetic]] medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children. [[Ondansetron]] has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DeCamp LR, Byerley JS, Doshi N, Steiner MJ |title=Use of antiemetic agents in acute gastroenteritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=162 |issue=9 |pages=858–65 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18762604|doi=10.1001/archpedi.162.9.858 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17279195">{{cite journal| author = Mehta S, Goldman RD| title = Ondansetron for acute gastroenteritis in children| journal = Can Fam Physician| volume = 52| issue = 11| pages = 1397–8| year = 2006| pmid = 17279195 | url =http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17279195 | pmc = 1783696 }}</ref><ref name=Cochrane2011/> [[Metoclopramide]] might also be helpful.<ref name=Cochrane2011>{{cite journal|last=Fedorowicz|first=Z|coauthors=Jagannath, VA, Carter, B|title=Antiemetics for reducing vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews |date=7 September 2011 |volume=9|pages=CD005506|pmid=21901699|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005506.pub5|issue=9}}</ref> However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sturm JJ, Hirsh DA, Schweickert A, Massey R, Simon HK |title=Ondansetron use in the pediatric emergency department and effects on hospitalization and return rates: are we masking alternative diagnoses? |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=415–22 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20031265 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.11.011 }}</ref> The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ondansetron|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/print/lexicomp/ondansetron.html|work=Lexi-Comp|month=May|year=2011}}</ref> [[Dimenhydrinate]], while reducing vomiting, does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit.<ref name=EBMED2010/>

==History==
The first usage of "gastroenteritis" was in 1825.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Gastroenteritis |format= |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2011 |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> Before this time it was more specifically known as [[typhoid fever]] or "cholera morbus", among others, or less specifically as "griping of the guts", "surfeit", "flux", "colic", "bowel complaint", or any one of a number of other archaic names for acute diarrhea.<ref name="archaic">[http://www.antiquusmorbus.com/English/English.htm Rudy's List of Archaic Medical Terms]</ref>

==Society and culture==
Gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names, including "[[Montezuma's revenge]]", "Delhi belly", "la turista", and "back door sprint", among others.<ref name=M93/> It has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be the origin of the term "no guts no glory".<ref name=M93/>

There are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development.
