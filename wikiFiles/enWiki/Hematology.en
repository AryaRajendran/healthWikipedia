'''Hematology''', [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelled]] '''haematology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''[[‘αἷμα]] haima'' "blood" and [[-logy|-λoγία]]), is the study of [[blood]], the blood-forming organs, and blood diseases.  Hematology includes the study of [[etiology]], [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], treatment, [[prognosis]], and [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] of blood diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as [[blood cells]], [[hemoglobin]], [[blood proteins]], and the mechanism of [[coagulation]]. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a [[medical technologist]]. Hematologists also conduct studies in [[oncology]]—the medical treatment of [[cancer]].

Physicians specialized in hematology are known as ''hematologists'' or '''haematologists'''.  Their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with hematological diseases, although some may also work at the hematology laboratory viewing [[blood film]]s and [[bone marrow]] slides under the [[microscope]], interpreting various hematological test results and [[blood clotting tests|blood clotting test]] results. In some institutions, hematologists also manage the hematology laboratory. Physicians who work in hematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of hematological diseases, referred to as '''hematopathologists'''.  Hematologists and hematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed. Hematology is a distinct subspecialty of internal medicine, separate from but overlapping with the subspecialty of medical [[oncology]]. Hematologists may specialize further or have special interests, for example, in:
*treating bleeding disorders such as [[hemophilia]] and [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]]
*treating hematological malignacies such as [[lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]]
*treating [[hemoglobinopathies]]
*in the science of [[blood transfusion]] and the work of a [[blood bank]]
*in bone marrow and [[stem cell transplantation]]
