'''Growing pains''' are [[pain]] symptoms relatively common in children. Typically, they are located in the muscles, rather than the joints, of the leg and less commonly the arm. They are usually felt on both sides, and appear late in the day or at night, waking the child, with pain varying from mild to very severe. Pain is absent by the morning, and there are no objective clinical signs of inflammation. Pain can recur nightly or be absent for days to months. Growing pain is not associated with other serious disease and usually resolves by late childhood, but frequent episodes are capable of having a substantial effect on the life of the child.<ref name="Uziel_2007">{{cite journal |author=Uziel Y, Hashkes PJ |title=Growing pains in children |journal=Pediatric rheumatology online journal |volume=5 |issue= |pages=5 |year=2007 |pmid=17550631 |doi=10.1186/1546-0096-5-5 |pmc=1869025}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
In the absence of limping, loss of mobility, or physical signs, laboratory investigation to exclude other diagnoses is not warranted.<ref name="Uziel_2007" /><ref name="Goodyear_2006">{{cite journal |author=Goodyear-Smith F, Arroll B |title=Growing pains: Parents and children need reassuring about this self limiting condition of unknown cause |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7566 |pages=456â€“7 |year=2006 |pmid=16946319 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38950.463877.80 |pmc=1557982}}</ref> [[Restless leg syndrome]] is sometimes misdiagnosed as growing pains.<ref name="Goodyear_2006" />

==Epidemiology==
Reported prevalences of growing pains have been between 3% and 49% of children.<ref name="Goodyear_2006" />
Growing pains are said to typically occur in two periods during a child's life, firstly, between about 3 and 5 years old, then later in 8 to 12 year olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/aches/growing_pains.html|title=Growing pains: information on diagnosis and treatment}}</ref> There are however no published epidemiological studies to support this observation. Individuals can vary markedly in when they experience growing pains.

==Cause==
The causes of growing pains are unknown. They are not associated with [[growth spurts]] and some authors suggest that the term 'recurrent limb pain in childhood' be used instead.<ref name="Goodyear_2006" /> Theories of causation include faulty posture, [[vascular perfusion disorder]], tiredness, or psychological causes.<ref name="Goodyear_2006" /> Some parents are able to associate episodes of pain with physical exercise or mood changes in the child.<ref name="Uziel_2007" />

==Treatment==
Parents and children can be substantially reassured by explaining the benign and self limiting nature of the pains.<ref name="Goodyear_2006" /> There are no substantial studies of the effectiveness of any intervention; however local massage, hot baths, hot water bottles or heating pads, and analgesic drugs such as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) are often used.<ref name="Uziel_2007" />
