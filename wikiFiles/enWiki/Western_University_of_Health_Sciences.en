==History==
The school originally opened in 1977 as the [[College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific]] (COMP), offering the [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.) degree. It was the first osteopathic medical school in California to open after the California College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons became an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] granting school, eventually becoming the [[University of California, Irvine School of Medicine]]. At the time, COMP was the only osteopathic medical school west of the [[Rocky Mountains]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Jesse|first=Katz|title=10-Year Quest: California Osteopaths: on the Mend|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-18/news/mn-2144_1_osteopathic-medicine/2|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=August 18, 1987}}</ref> and it remained the only one in California until 1997, when [[Touro University California]] opened in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]].<ref name=41stMedicalTrust2008>{{cite web|title= 41st Medical Trust - New Beginnings for D.O.s in California|url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/themerger/new-beginnings-for-dos.html| publisher= UCI Libraries|accessdate=2011-12-20|date=2008-11-18}}</ref> The inaugural class consisted of 36 students.<ref name=RecordEnroll />

In 1986, the college began offering a second degree, the Master of Science in Health Professions Education.  Four years later, the [[physician assistant]] program opened, which developed into a [[Master's degree|masters level]] program in 2000.  In 1992, the [[physical therapy]] program opened.  The Western Association of Schools and Colleges granted the school accreditation in March 1996, and later that same year, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific was restructured into a university and given the name â€œWestern University of Health Sciences."<ref name=aboutpharm />  The same year, the first classes in the college of pharmacy began.<ref name=aboutpharm>{{cite web|title= Western University of Health Sciences (College of Pharmacy) |publisher= Pharmacy Schools|date=|url= http://www.aboutpharmacyschools.com/pharmacyschool/western-university-of-health-sciences |accessdate=March 5, 2012}}</ref>  

After difficulties with accreditation through the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]]'s Council on Education<ref name=Weiss>{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=Kenneth R.|title=First Veterinary School in Southland Approved for Pomona|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/06/local/me-33897|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=March 6, 2001}}</ref> the College of Veterinary Medicine opened in 1998. It was the first veterinary medical school to open in the United States since 1983,<ref name=Weiss /> and at the time, no member on the Council on Education had ever been involved in accrediting a new veterinary medical school.

==Campus==
The downtown [[Pomona, California]] campus consists of 19 major buildings on {{convert|22|acre|ha}}.<ref name=examine_curriculum /> A portion of the campus was extensively renovated from an outdoor shopping mall. In 1992, the university received the option to buy the Pomona [[Buffum's|Buffum's department store]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Pomona: Option on Buffum's Building |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-08/news/ga-5861_1_pomona|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=March 8, 1992}}</ref> which was built in 1962. The university subsequently acquired the building, which now houses the Health Professions Center.  The University Research Center was once a [[JCPenney]].<ref name=LaTimes /> The Health Science Center, a two-[[Storey|story]] 72,000 square-foot building, was formerly a Nash Department Store.<ref name=Pomona_Starts_Over>{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Denise|title=Pomona Starts Over : The diverse forces of art, education and commerce are sparking a renaissance for the city's faded downtown.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-26/news/ga-24584_1_downtown-pomona/2|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=January 26, 1995}}</ref> 

In August 2001, the university opened the Health Sciences Library on west edge of campus (3rd street). The 35,000 square-foot building was originally constructed in 1929, and previously housed a switching station for the [[Pacific Telephone & Telegraph]] company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Western University to Dedicate New Health Sciences Library and Learning Resources Center|url=http://wsprod.westernu.edu/news/nr_detail.jsp?id=229&groupname=AllNews|date=2 August 2001|publisher=WesternU |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> In 2010, two additional buildings opened on campus, the Health Education Center and the Patient Care Center, along with a parking structure.

In June 2009, groundbreaking took place for the first building on the [[College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Northwest|new medical school]] campus in Lebanon, Oregon. The new {{convert|55000|ft2|adj=on}} building cost about $15 million to build,<ref>{{cite news|last=Weinstein|first=Nathalie|title=Medical school breaks ground in Lebanon|url=http://djcoregon.com/news/2009/06/25/medical-school-breaks-gound-in-lebanon/|accessdate=1 August 2011|newspaper=Daily Journal of Commerce|date=June 25, 2009}}</ref> and opened for classes in August 2011.<ref name="opening"/>

In August 2012, the Center for Oral Health, a non-profit organization focusing on promoting oral health, moved its headquarters from the [[Bay Area|bay area]] of California to Western University of Health Sciences' campus, and established an affiliation with the university.<ref>{{cite web|last=BÃ¡rzaga, MD|first=Conrado E.|title=COH Relocation to Southern California|url=http://www.centerfororalhealth.org/news/coh-relocation-to-southern-california.html|publisher=Center for Oral Health|date=August 15, 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>

==Interprofessional Education==
{{Main|Interprofessional education}}
In 2007, WesternU initiated the planning stages of an Interprofessional Education (IPE) program, involving all 9 its colleges; with goals to improve understanding of other health professions and to provide and promote a team approach to patient-centered care and health care management, leading to improved patient care.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.westernu.edu/interprofessional-about | title= About IPE | author= Pumerantz PhD, Philip | work= Western University of Health Sciences | accessdate= December 21, 2011 }}</ref> While a debate exists on the effectiveness of interprofessional education in encouraging collaborative practice, IPE is becoming a more common component of medical school curriculum in the United States, and many groups, including the [[World Health Organization]], view it as a means of reducing medical errors and improving the health care system<ref name=USNewsIPE>{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2012/03/19/medical-schools-push-teamwork |title=Medical Schools Push Teamwork |author=Kathryn Roethel |date=March 19, 2012 |work= |publisher=US News & World Report |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

As a part of the program, students meet in small groups with a faculty facilitator and discuss the non-clinical aspects of complex cases, such as financial or ethical challenges, communication barriers, interprofessional knowledge and awareness, etc.  In the 2010-11 academic year, the IPE program involved 850 students and 150 faculty members from the 9 colleges at the university. The development of clinical IPE rotations with grand rounds and journal clubs is currently being explored.<ref name=Mackintosh2011>{{cite journal |last1=Mackintosh |first1=Susan E |last2=Adams |first2=Clinton E |last3=Singer-Chang |first3=Gail |last4=Hruby |first4=Raymond |year=2011 |title=Osteopathic Approach to Implementing and Promoting Interprofessional Education |journal= [[JAOA â€“ The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|Journal of the American Osteopathic Association]] |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=206â€“212 |publisher=JAOA |doi= |url= http://www.jaoa.org/content/111/4/206.abstract |accessdate=December 2011}}</ref>
