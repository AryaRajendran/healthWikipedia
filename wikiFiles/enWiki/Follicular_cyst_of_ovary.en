The '''follicular cyst of ovary''', or ''[[graafian follicle]] cyst'', or ''[[ovarian follicle|follicular]] cyst'' is a type of functional<ref>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/functional-ovarian-cysts Functional ovarian cysts] at Cancer Research UK. Retrieved July 2012</ref> simple cyst, and is the most common type of [[ovarian cyst]]. 

==Pathophysiology==
This type can form when ovulation doesn't occur, and a follicle doesn't rupture or release its egg but instead grows until it becomes a cyst, or when a mature follicle [[involute]]s (collapses on itself).  It usually forms during ovulation, and can grow to about 6cm (2.3 inches) in diameter.  It is thin-walled, lined by one or more layers of [[granulosa]] cell, and filled with clear fluid.

==Presentation==
Its rupture can create sharp, severe pain on the side of the ovary on which the cyst appears.  This sharp pain (sometimes called [[mittelschmerz]]) occurs in the middle of the [[menstrual cycle]], during ovulation.  About a fourth of women with this type of cyst experience pain.(citation needed)  

Usually, these cysts produce no symptoms and disappear by themselves within a few months.

==Diagnosis==
[[Ultrasound]] is the primary tool used to document the follicular cyst.  A pelvic exam will also aid in the diagnosis if the cyst is large enough to be seen.  A doctor monitors these to make sure they disappear, and looks at treatment options if they do not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8442 |title=Follicular cyst of the ovary definition|format= |work=MedTerms |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=AltSurg>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativesurgery.com/education/ovariancysts.php |title=Ovarian Cysts |format= |work=The Institute for Female Alternative Medicine.. |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cyst101.com/cause.htm]</ref><ref>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/1040580634.htm]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ovarian-cysts/DS00129 |title=Ovarian cysts |format= |work=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/opath/Chapters/DictionaryF.html+%22follicular+cyst%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=35&gl=us</ref>
