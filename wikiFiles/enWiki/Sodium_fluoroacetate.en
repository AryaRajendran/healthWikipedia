'''Sodium fluoroacetate''' is the [[organofluorine chemistry|organofluorine]] [[chemical compound]] with the formula FCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Na. This colourless [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] has a taste similar to that of [[sodium chloride]] and is used as a [[poison#Metabolic poisons (energy)|metabolic poison]]. It occurs naturally as an anti-[[herbivore]] metabolite in various [[plant]]s but can also be produced synthetically.  It is a derivative of [[fluoroacetic acid]], a [[carboxylic acid]].   It is sold as a [[pesticide]] under the name "1080".   The more common fluorinated acetic acid [[trifluoroacetic acid]] and its derivatives are far less toxic.

==History and production==
The effectiveness of sodium fluoroacetate as a rodenticide was reported in 1942.<ref name=kalmbach>{{cite journal | author = Kalmbach, E. R. | title = Ten-Eighty, a War-Produced Rodenticide | journal = Science | year = 1945 | volume = 102 | issue = 2644 | pages = 232–233 | doi = 10.1126/science.102.2644.232 | pmid = 17778513 }}</ref> The name "1080" refers to the catalogue number of the poison, which became its brand name.<ref name="Proudfoot">{{cite journal | author = Proudfoot, A.

The salt is synthesized by treating sodium chloroacetate with [[potassium fluoride]].<ref name=Aigueperse>{{ Ullmann | author = Aigueperse, J.; Mollard, P.; Devilliers, D.; Chemla, M.; Faron, R.; Romano, R.; Cuer, J.

The only company now producing 1080 is the Tull Chemical Company in Alabama USA, who export the material to Mexico & Israel (as a rodenticide), Australia (where its used to kill dingoes, wild dogs and foxes) and New Zealand (for possum control). 1080 use in the USA itself is tightly controlled, and it may only be used in chemical collars on domestic herbivores, to kill coyotes.

==Occurrence==

===Fluoroacetate occurrence in ''Gastrolobium'' species===
''[[Gastrolobium]]'' is a genus of flowering plants in the family [[Fabaceae]]. There are over 100 species in this genus, and all but two are native to the south west region of Western Australia, where they are known as "poison peas". Gastrolobium growing in south western Australia are unique in their ability to concentrate fluoroacetate from low fluorine soils.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee, J. | title = Deadly plants face threat of extinction | journal = ANU Reporter | year = 1998 | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | publisher = Australian National University | url = http://info.anu.edu.au/mac/Newsletters_and_Journals/ANU_Reporter/_pdf/vol_29_no_06/extinction.html | accessdate = 2012-08-07 }}</ref> Brush-tailed possums, bush rats and western grey kangaroos native to this region are capable of safely eating plants containing fluoroacetate, but livestock and introduced species from elsewhere in Australia are highly-susceptible to the poison,<ref>{{cite web | author = McKenzie, R. | title = Australian Native Poisonous Plants | publisher = Australian Native Plants Society | work = Australian Plants Online | year = 1997 | url = http://anpsa.org.au/APOL7/sep97-4.html | accessdate = 2012-08-07 }}</ref> as are species introduced from outside Australia, such as the [[red fox]]. The fact that many Gastrolobium species also have high secondary toxicity to non-native carnivores is thought to have limited the ability of cats to establish populations in locations where the plants form a major part of the understorey vegetation.<ref>{{cite book | author = Short, J.; Atkins, L.; Turner, B. | year = 2005 | title = Diagnosis of Mammal Decline in Western Australia, with Particular Emphasis on the Possible Role of Feral Cats and Poison Peas | url = http://www.wildliferesearchmanagement.com.au/Report_NGS.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2011-09-26 | publisher = Wildlife Research and Management Pty | location = Australia }}</ref>

The presence of Gastrolobium species in the fields of farmers in [[Western Australia]] has often forced these farmers to 'scalp' their land, that is remove the top soil and any poison pea seed which it may contain, and replace it with a new poison pea-free top soil sourced from elsewhere in which to sow crops. Similarly, following bushfires in north-western [[Queensland]] cattlemen have to move livestock before the poisonous [[Gastrolobium grandiflorum]] emerges from the ashes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Death lurks in the ashes on western farms |publisher=Townsville Bulletin| month = September | year = 2011 | url =http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/09/22/268601_news.html | accessdate = 2011-09-23}}</ref>

==Toxicology==
Fluoroacetate is toxic to all [[obligate aerobic]] organisms and highly toxic to mammals and insects.<ref name="Proudfoot"/> The oral dose of fluoroacetate sufficient to be lethal in humans is 2–10&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="Beasley">{{cite web | last = Beasley| first = Michael | title =Guidelines for the safe use of sodium fluoroacetate (1080) | publisher = New Zealand Occupational Safety & Health Service | month = August | year = 2002 | url =http://www.osh.govt.nz/order/catalogue/pdf/1080guidelines.pdf | accessdate = 2007-12-17|format=PDF}}</ref>

The toxicity varies with species. The [[New Zealand Food Safety Authority]] established lethal doses for a number of species. Dogs, cats and pigs appear to be most susceptible to poisoning.<ref name="ACVM">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Controlled Pesticides: Sodium Fluoroacetate (1080) in Pest Control  | publisher = Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Group | date = | url =http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/acvm/publications/notes/1080-study-notes.pdf | accessdate = 2007-12-17|format=PDF}}</ref>

The [[enzyme]] [[fluoroacetate dehalogenase]] has been discovered in a soil [[bacterium]], which can detoxify fluoroacetate in the surrounding medium.

===Mechanism of action===
Fluoroacetate is similar to acetate, which has a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. Fluoroacetate disrupts the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle) by combining with [[coenzyme A]] to form fluoroacetyl CoA, which reacts with [[citrate synthase]] to produce [[fluorocitric acid|fluorocitrate]]. A metabolite of fluorocitrate binds very tightly to [[aconitase]], thereby halting the citric acid cycle. This inhibition results in an accumulation of citrate in the blood which deprives cells of energy.<ref name="Proudfoot"/>

===Symptoms===
In [[human]]s, the [[symptoms]] of poisoning normally appear between 30 minutes and three hours after exposure. Initial symptoms typically include nausea, [[vomiting]] and abdominal pain; sweating, confusion and agitation follow. In significant poisoning, cardiac abnormalities including [[tachycardia]] or [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]] and [[ECG]] changes develop. Neurological effects include muscle twitching and seizures; [[consciousness]] becomes progressively impaired after a few hours leading to [[coma]]. Death is normally due to [[ventricular arrhythmia]]s, progressive hypotension unresponsive to treatment, and secondary lung infections.<ref name="Proudfoot"/>

Symptoms in domestic animals vary: dogs tend to show nervous system signs such as convulsions, vocalization and uncontrollable running, whilst large herbivores such as cattle and sheep more predominantly show cardiac signs.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=NgMX__L3q40C&pg=PA556 | author = Gupta, R. | title = Veterinary Toxicology: Basic and Clinical Principles | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2007 | page = 556 | isbn = 0-12-370467-7 | accessdate = 2012-08-08 }}</ref>

Sub-lethal doses of sodium fluoroacetate may cause damage to tissues with high energy needs &mdash; in particular, the [[brain]], [[gonad]]s, [[heart]], [[lungs]] and [[fetus]]. Sub-lethal doses are typically completely metabolised and excreted within four days.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Eason, C. T.; Frampton, C. M.; Henderson, R.; Thomas, M. D.; Morgan, D.

===Treatment===
Effective [[antidote]]s are unknown. [[Animal testing|Research]] in [[monkey]]s has shown that the use of [[glyceryl]] mono[[acetate]] can prevent problems if given after ingestion of sodium fluoroacetate, and this therapy has been tested in domestic animals with some positive results. In theory, glyceryl monoacetate supplies acetate ions to allow continuation of cellular respiration which the sodium fluoroacetate had disrupted.<ref>{{ cite book | author = Brent, J. | title = Critical Care Toxicology | publisher = Mosby | location = St. Louis | year = 2005 | page = 970 | isbn = 0-8151-4387-7 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=WuA4LsWXXWEC&pg=PA970 | quote = Glycerol monoacetate, 0.1 to 0.5 mL/kg/hr, as a Krebs cycle substrate replacement, has prolonged survival in a primate model, but it also may aggravate toxicity and seems to be effective only early in the course. | accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}</ref> 

Experiments of Dr Goncharov and co-workers resulted in development of a successful therapeutic complex, containing a phenothiazine compound, a dioic acid compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another aspect the pharmaceutical composition can include a phenothiazine compound, a nitroester compound, ethanol and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<ref>Goncharov N.V., Kuznetsov A.V., Glashkina L.M., Radilov A.S.

In clinical cases, use of [[muscle relaxant]]s, [[anti-convulsant]]s, [[mechanical ventilation]], and other supportive measures may all be required. Few animals or people have been treated successfully after significant sodium fluoroacetate ingestions.<ref>{{ cite book | author = Rippe, J. M.; Irwin, R.

[[Activated charcoal]] should be administered in all suspected ingestions presenting within 1 to 2 hours after ingestion. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Hypocalcemia and prolonged QTc intervals may require calcium and magnesium supplementation. Various treatments have been tested in animals [149,161-163]. The most useful agent appears to be glyceryl monoacetate, which provides excess acetate as a substrate for the TCA cycle. The clinical use of glyceryl monoacetate remains unproven, however. | accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}</ref>

==Pesticide use==
[[Image:Brushtail possum.jpg|thumb|right|Common Brushtail Possum, an invasive pest in New Zealand whose population is controlled with sodium fluoroacetate.]]
Sodium fluoroacetate is used as a [[pesticide]], especially for [[mammal]]ian [[pest (organism)|pest]] species. [[Farmer]]s and [[grazier]]s use the poison to protect pastures and crops from various herbivorous mammals. In [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] it is also used to control invasive non-native mammals that predate or compete with native wildlife and vegetation.

===Australia===
[[Image:1080PoisonWarning gobeirne.jpg|thumb|Sign warning of poisonous sodium fluoroacetate baits]]
In [[Australia]], sodium fluoroacetate was first used in rabbit control programmes in the early 1950s, where it is regarded as having "a long history of proven effectiveness and safety".<ref>{{ cite document | publisher = Department of Agriculture, Department of Conservation and Land Management, Department of Health | year = 2002 | title = 1080 Summary information | work = Miscellaneous Publication No. 011/2002 }}</ref> It is seen as a critical component of the integrated pest control programmes for [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es, wild dogs, and feral pigs. Since 1994, broad-scale fox control using 1080 meat baits in [[Western Australia]] has significantly improved the population numbers of several native species and led, for the first time, to three species of mammals being taken off the state's endangered species list. In Australia, minor direct mortality of native animal populations from 1080 baits is regarded as acceptable, compared to the predatory and competitive effects of those introduced species being managed using 1080.<ref>{{ cite web | title = The use of 1080 for pest control - 4.1 Key facts  | publisher = NZ Department of Conservation | url = http://www.doc.govt.nz/publications/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/the-use-of-1080-for-pest-control/4-information-about-1080/4_1-key-facts/ }}</ref>
 
[[Western Shield]] is a project to boost populations of endangered mammals in south-west Australia conducted by the [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|DEC]]. The project entails distributing fluoroacetate baited meat from the air to kill [[predator]]s. Wild [[dog]]s and [[fox]]es will readily eat the baited meat. [[Cat]]s pose a greater difficulty as they are generally not interested in scavenging.  However, an Australian [[RSPCA]] commissioned study criticized 1080, calling it an inhumane killer.<ref>{{cite web | last =Speechley | first =Jane | title =1080 is not a humane poison: International journal publishes RSPCA paper  | publisher = RSPCA | date = 15 November 2007 | url =http://www.rspca.org.au/mediareleases/MRShow.asp?ID=131 | accessdate = 2007-12-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071118014551/http://www.rspca.org.au/mediareleases/MRShow.asp?ID=131 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-18}}</ref>  Some Western Australian herbivores have, by [[natural selection]], developed partial [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the effects of fluoroacetate,<ref>L.

In 2011, over 3,750 toxic baits containing 3ml of 1080 were laid across 520 hectares between the [[Tasmania]]n settlements of [[Southport]] and [[Hobart]] as part of an ongoing attempt at the world's biggest invasive animal eradication operation – the eradication of [[red fox]]es from the island state. The baits were spread at the rate of one per 10 hectares and were buried, to mitigate the risk to non-target wildlife species like [[Tasmanian devil]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title =Full-on blitz for foxes | publisher = The Mercury (Tasmania) | date = 23 September 2011 | url =http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/09/23/263721_tasmania-news.html | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}</ref>

Native animals are also targeted with 1080. During May 2005 up to 200,000 Bennetts wallabies on King Island were intentionally killed in one of the largest coordinated 1080 poisonings seen in Tasmania;<ref>http://www.kangaroo-protection-coalition.com/wallaby-poison.html</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1438832.htm</ref>

Development and use of sodium fluoroacetate as a predacide and rodenticide in the U.S. began in the 1940s prior to the 1947 enactment of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act by which requirements for federal registration of pesticide products were instituted. In 1964 and again in 1971, the use of poisons to control predatory mammals were reviewed by selected committees. In 1972, EPA cancelled all registered predator control uses of sodium fluoroacetate, sodium cyanide, and strychnine. In 1977, the US Department of the Interior (USDI) applied for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) to investigate the potential risks and benefits associated with the use of sodium fluoroacetate in "toxic collars" which would be placed on the necks of sheep and goats. ... In 1981, EPA was petitioned by the USDI and livestock interests to revisit the 1972 predacide cancellation decision with respect to sodium fluoroacetate. ... In 1985, EPA granted a registration to USDI for a toxic collar product which was transferred in 1986 to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). ... The rodenticide uses of sodium fluoroacetate were cancelled due to lack of supporting data. In 1989, all "special local needs" registrations issued under § 24(c) of FIFRA were cancelled, and all pending applications for Federal registration were denied by August 1990. }}</ref>

==Environmental impacts==

===Water===
Since 1080 is highly water soluble, it will be dispersed and diluted in the environment by rain and stream water. Sodium monofluoroacetate at the concentrations found in the environment after standard baiting operations will break down in natural water containing living organisms, such as aquatic plants or micro-organisms. Water-monitoring surveys, conducted during the 1990s, have confirmed that significant contamination of waterways following aerial application of 1080 bait is unlikely.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Eason | first1 = C.

===Soil===
The fate of 1080 in the soil has been well-established by research defining the degradation of naturally-occurring fluoroacetate (Oliver, 1977). Sodium monofluoroacetate is water soluble and residues from uneaten baits leach into the soil where they are degraded to non-toxic metabolites by soil microorganisms, including bacteria (''[[Pseudomonas]]'') and the common soil fungus (''[[Fusarium solani]]'') (David and Gardiner, 1966; Bong, Cole and Walker, 1979; Walker and Bong, 1981).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eason, C.

===Birds===
Although it is now infrequent, individual aerial 1080 operations can still sometimes affect local [[bird]] populations if not carried out with sufficient care. In [[New Zealand]], individuals from 19 species of native birds and 13 species of introduced birds have been found dead after aerial 1080 drops. Most of these recorded bird deaths were associated with only four operations in the 1970s that used poor quality carrot baits with many small fragments.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Evaluating the use of 1080 - Predators, poisons and silent forests | year = 2011 | publisher = Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment | location = New Zealand | url = http://www.pce.parliament.nz/assets/Uploads/PCE-1080.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref> On the other hand, many native New Zealand bird populations have been successfully protected by reducing predator numbers through aerial 1080 operations.

===Reptiles and amphibians===
[[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s are susceptible to 1080, although much less sensitive to it than [[mammal]]s.<ref>Evaluating the use of 1080 (Parliamentary Commissioner For The Environment, 2011): http://www.pce.parliament.nz/assets/Uploads/PCE-1080.pdf</ref> Amphibian and reptile species that have been tested in Australia are generally more tolerant to 1080 poison than are most other animals.<ref>The Sensitivity of Australian Animals to 1080 Poison VIII.* Amphibians and Reptiles (McIlroy et al. 1985): http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WR9850113.htm</ref> McIlroy (1992) calculated that even if lizards fed entirely on insects or other animals poisoned with 1080 they could never ingest enough poison to receive a lethal dose.<ref>McIlroy, J.C. 1992: Secondary poisoning hazards associated with 1080-treated carrot baiting campaigns against rabbits, 1992</ref> Laboratory trials in New Zealand simulating worst-case scenarios indicate that both [[Archey's frog|''Leiopelma archeyi'']] and [[Hochstetter's frog|''L. hochstetteri'']] can absorb 1080 from contaminated water, substrate, or prey. The chance of this occurring in the wild is ameliorated by a variety of factors, including frog ecology. Captive maintenance and contamination problems rendered parts of this study inconclusive. Further population monitoring is recommended to provide more conclusive evidence than provided by this single study.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Perfect, A. J.; Bell, B.

===Fish===
Fish generally have very low sensitivity to 1080. Toxicity tests have been conducted in the [[USA]] on [[bluegill sunfish]], [[rainbow trout]] and the freshwater invertebrate ''[[Daphnia magna]]''. Tests at different 1080 concentrations on sunfish (for four days) and ''Daphnia'' (two days) showed that 1080 is "practically non-toxic" (a US EPA classification) to both these species. Rainbow trout were also tested over four days at four concentrations ranging from 39 to 170&nbsp;mg 1080 per litre. From these results an LC50 can be calculated, which is the concentration of 1080 per litre of water which theoretically kills 50% of the test fish. The LC50 for rainbow trout was calculated to be 54&nbsp;mg 1080/litre - far in excess of any known concentration of 1080 found in water samples following 1080 aerial operations. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that 1080 is most unlikely to cause mortality in freshwater fish.<ref>The use of 1080 for pest control - Comparison of species sensitivity

===Invertebrates===
Insects are susceptible to 1080 poisoning. Some field trials in [[New Zealand]] have shown that insect numbers can be temporarily reduced within 20&nbsp;cm of toxic baits, but numbers return to normal levels within six days of the bait being removed.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Impacts of 1080-poisoning for possum control on non-target invertebrates | author = Spurr, E.
