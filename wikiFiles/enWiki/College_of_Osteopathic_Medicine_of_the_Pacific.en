Graduates of COMP receive a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.) degree and are referred to as osteopathic physicians.  Osteopathic physicians, like [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D. physicians]], are complete physicians and are licensed to prescribe medication and perform surgery.

== Academics ==
The '''first two years''' of medical school at COMP focus on the basic sciences, and a systems-based approach to basic clinical sciences. Much of the curriculum at COMP is [[Case report|case]]-based,<ref>{{cite news|last=Prep|first=Veritas|title=Medical School Profile: Western University of Health Sciences|url=http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2012/11/05/medical-school-profile-western-university-of-health-sciences|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=US News & World Report|date=November 5, 2012}}</ref> rather than [[lecture]]-based, especially during the second year.

The Intensive Summer Anatomy Course is an optional course for students interested in anatomy.  

The curriculum at COMP includes [[Interprofessional education|Interprofessional Education]] (IPE), a program that involves 9 colleges at WesternU.
