'''Pentylenetetrazol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as metrazol, pentetrazol, pentamethylenetetrazol, Cardiazol or PTZ, is a drug used as a circulatory and respiratory stimulant. High doses cause [[convulsions]], as discovered by the Hungarian-American neurologist and psychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] in 1934. It has been used in [[convulsive therapy]], but was never considered to be effective, and side-effects such as [[seizure]]s were difficult to avoid.  Its approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] was revoked in 1982.<ref name="sciam">{{cite news | author = JR Minkel | title = Drug May Counteract Down Syndrome | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&articleID=F9E196DB-E7F2-99DF-385C9F38537F58D6 | publisher = Scientific American | date = February 25, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-03-20}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Pentylenetetrazol is considered a [[GABA antagonist]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=mesh&list_uids=68010433&dopt=Full Entry for Pentylenetetrazole] in the [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] database</ref> The [[mechanism of action|mechanism]] of the [[epileptogenic]] action of pentylenetetrazol at the cellular [[neurons|neuronal]] level is still unclear. [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] studies have shown it acts at [[cell membrane]] level decreasing the recovery time between [[action potential]]s by increasing [[potassium]] [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] of the [[axon]]. Other studies have implicated an increase in membrane currents of several other ions, such as [[sodium]] and [[calcium]], leading to an overall increase in [[excitability]] of the neuron membrane.

==Uses==
Pentylenetetrazol has been used experimentally to study seizure phenomenon and to identify pharmaceuticals that may control seizure susceptibility. Pentylenetetrazol is also a prototypical [[anxiogenic]] drug and, has been extensively utilized in animal models of [[anxiety]]. Pentylenetetrazol produces a reliable [[discriminative stimulus]] which is largely mediated by the [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] receptor. Several classes of compounds can modulate the pentylenetetrazol discriminative stimulus including [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]], [[5-HT3|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]], [[NMDA]], [[glycine]], and [[L-type calcium channel]] [[ligands]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jung M, Lal H, Gatch M |title=The discriminative stimulus effects of pentylenetetrazol as a model of anxiety: recent developments |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=429–39 |year=2002 |pmid=12204190 |doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(02)00010-6}}</ref>

Recently, Stanford University researchers have renewed interest in PTZ as a candidate for pharmacological treatment of [[Down syndrome]]. Published in the April 2007 issue of [[Nature Neuroscience]], their brief communication outlined an experiment designed to test the underlying theory proposed to explain the purported efficacy of [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] antagonists in restoring the [[declarative memory]] deficits associated with the mouse model of human Down Syndrome. Ts65Dn mice injected with a 2-week regiment of either of  two compounds [[picrotoxin]] or [[bilobalide]] (both GABA antagonists) showed marked improvements in both exploration and recognition of novel objects over controls injected with only saline. These results were duplicated in a second experiment with mice fed either plain milk or a combination of milk and a non-epileptogenic dose of PTZ daily for 17 days.  PTZ-fed mice achieved novel object task scores comparable to wild-type (normal) mice. These improvements persisted at least 1 to 2 months after the treatment regiment. Not surprisingly these compounds' efficacies were accompanied by the normalization of [[Long-term potentiation]] in the [[dentate gyrus]] one month after the end of treatment, further suggesting persistent drug-mediated improvements in learning and memory.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fernandez F, Morishita W, Zuniga E, Nguyen J, Blank M, Malenka R, Garner C |title=Pharmacotherapy for cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Down syndrome |journal=Nat Neurosci |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=411–413 |year=2007 |url=http://med.stanford.edu/nbc/articles/7%20-%20Pharmacotherapy%20for%20Cognitive%20Impairment%20in%20a%20Mouse%20Model%20of%20Down%20Syndrome.pdf |pmid=17322876 |doi=10.1038/nn1860}}</ref>

The finding of pentylenetetrazol's effectiveness in treating a mouse model of Down syndrome has led to it being explored as a means of correcting other learning deficiencies.  Specifically, hamsters denied their natural [[circadian rhythm]] (though not denied sleep) had their memory restored to near-normal levels when treated with pentylenetetrazol.<ref>Ruby et al.; Hippocampal-dependent learning requires a functional circadian system; Proceedings of the  National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2008, vol. 105, no. 40,15593-15598</ref>

==Alternatives==
In 1939, pentylenetetrazol was replaced by [[electroconvulsive therapy]] as the preferred method for inducing seizures in England's mental hospitals.
