A '''physical examination''', '''medical examination''', or '''clinical examination'''  (more popularly known as a '''check-up''' or '''medical''') is the process by which a medical professional investigates the body of a [[patient]] for [[medical sign|signs]] of [[disease]]. It generally follows the taking of the [[medical history]] — an account of the [[symptom]]s as experienced by the patient. Together with the medical history, the physical examination aids in determining the correct [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and devising the treatment plan. This data then becomes part of the [[medical record]].

Routine annual physicals—a physical examination given to an apparently healthy person for no particular purpose, rather than an examination done to discover the cause of the patient's [[chief complaint]]—generally do not provide any health benefits.<ref name="Krogsbøll2012" />

== Medical uses ==
A physical examination may be provided under [[health insurance]] cover, required of new insurance customers, or stipulated as a condition of employment (in this case, it is called pre employment medical clearance). This is a part of the [[insurance medicine]]. In the United States, physicals are also marketed to patients as a one-stop health review, avoiding the inconvenience of attending multiple appointments with different healthcare providers.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Susan |last=Brink |title=$2,000 physicals for busy execs |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/18/health/he-exec18 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=18 February 2008 |accessdate=16 July 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/07/21/229208/index.htm |publisher=CNN.com |date=21 July 1997 |title=2,500 executives flock to Rochester, Minn., for a deluxe, soup-to-nuts physical at the Mayo clinic.

While elective physical exams have become more elaborate, in routine use physical exams have become less complete.  This has led to editorials in medical journals about the importance of an adequate physical examination.

== Format and interpretation ==
[[File:Elderly vietnamese man gets examined.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Auscultation]] of a man in [[Vietnam]]]]
Although providers have varying approaches as to the sequence of body parts, a systematic examination generally starts at the [[Human head|head]] and finishes at the [[limb (anatomy)|extremities]]. After the main organ systems have been investigated by [[inspection (medicine)|inspection]], [[palpation]], [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]], and [[auscultation]], specific tests may follow (such as a [[neurology|neurological]] investigation, [[orthopedic]] examination) or specific tests when a particular disease is suspected (e.g. eliciting [[Trousseau sign of latent tetany|Trousseau's sign]] in [[hypocalcemia]]).

With the clues obtained during the ''history'' and ''physical examination'' the healthcare provider can now formulate a [[differential diagnosis]], a list of potential causes of the symptoms.  Specific diagnostic tests (or occasionally [[empirical therapy]]) generally confirm the cause, or shed light on other, previously overlooked, causes.

While the format of examination as listed below is largely as taught and expected of students, a specialist will focus on their particular field and the nature of the problem described by the patient. Hence a cardiologist will not in routine practice undertake neurological parts of the examination other than noting that the patient is able to use all four limbs on entering the consultation room and during the consultation become aware of their hearing, eyesight and speech. Likewise an Orthopaedic surgeon will examine the affected joint, but may only briefly check the heart sounds and chest to ensure that there is not likely to be any contraindication to surgery raised by the [[anaesthetist]]. A primary care physician will also generally examine the male [[Sex organ|genitals]] but may leave the examination of the female genitalia to a gynecologist.

A complete physical examination includes evaluation of general patient appearance and specific organ systems.  It is recorded in the [[medical record]] in a standard layout which facilitates others later reading the notes.  In practice the [[Vital signs (medicine)|vital signs]] of [[temperature examination]], [[pulse]] and [[blood pressure]] are usually measured first.

=== Example ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Section
! Sample text
! Comments
|-
| General
| "Patient in NAD. [[Vital signs|VS]]: WNL"
| May be split on two lines. "WNL" = "within normal limits".
|-
| [[HEENT examination|HEENT]]:
| "NC/AT. [[PERRLA]], [[EOMI]]. No cervical [[lymphadenopathy|LAD]], no thyromegaly, no [[bruit]], no [[pallor]], [[fundus]]{{dn|date=March 2013}} WNL, [[oropharynx]] WNL, [[tympanic membrane]] WNL, neck supple"
| "Neck" is sometimes split out from "Head". "Good [[dentition]]" may be noted.
|-
| [[Respiratory examination|Resp]] or "Chest"
| "Nontender, CTA bilat" Chest expansion test, normal breathing with little effort, absence of wheezing, rhonchi and crackles.
| More detailed examinations can include [[rales]], [[rhonchi]], [[wheezing]] ("no r/r/w"), and [[Liniment|rubs]]. Other phrases may include "no cyanosis or clubbing" (if section is labeled "Resp" and not "Chest"), "[[fremitus]] WNL", and "no dullnes to percussion".
|-
| [[Cardiovascular examination|CV]] or "Heart"
| "+S1, +S2, RRR, no [[Heart murmur|m]]/[[rubs|r]]/[[Gallop rhythm|g]]"
| If "CV" is used instead of "heart", peripheral pulses are sometimes included in this section (otherwise, they may be in the extremities section)
|-
| [[Abdominal examination|Abd]]
| "Soft, nontender, nondistended, absence of pain, no [[hepatosplenomegaly]], [[bowel sounds|NBS]]"
| If lower back pain is involved, then the "Back" may become a primary section. [[Costovertebral angle tenderness]] may be included in the abdominal section if there is no back section. More detailed examinations may report "+[[psoas sign]], +[[Rovsing's sign]], +[[obturator sign]]". If tenderness was present, it might be reported as "Direct and [[rebound tenderness|rebound]] [[RLQ]] tenderness". "NBS" stands for "normal bowel sounds"; alternatives might include "hypoactive BS" or "hyperactive BS".
|-
| [[Limb (anatomy)|Ext]]
| "No [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]], [[cyanosis]], [[edema]]"
| Checking the fingers for clubbing and cyanosis is sometimes considered part of the pulmonary exam, because it closely involves oxygenation. Examinations of the [[knee]] may involve the [[McMurray test]], [[Lachman test]], and [[drawer test]].
|-
| [[Neurologic exam|Neuro]]
| "A&Ox3, [[cranial nerve|CN]] II-XII grossly intact, [[Sense|Sensation]] intact in all four extremities (dull and sharp), DTR 2+ bilat, [[Romberg's test|Romberg]] negative, [[cerebellar]] [[reflexes]] WNL, normal [[gait]]"
| Sensation may be expanded to include dull, sharp, vibration, temperature, and position sense. A [[mental status exam]] may be reported at the beginning of the neurologic exam, or under a distinct "Psych" section.
|}

Depending upon the [[chief complaint]], additional sections may be included. For example, hearing may be evaluated with a specific [[Weber test]] and [[Rinne test]], or it may be more briefly addressed in a [[cranial nerve]] exam. To give another example, a neurological related complaint might be evaluated with a specific test, such as the [[Romberg maneuver]].

== Vital signs ==

The primary vital signs are:
* [[Temperature examination|Temperature recording]]
* [[blood pressure#Measurement|Blood pressure]]
* [[Pulse]]
* [[Respiratory rate]]

* [[General medical examination]]
* [[Heart sounds]]

== Ineffectiveness ==
An annual physical does not reduce the risk of dying from cancer, heart disease, or any other cause.  It does not reduce the patient's likelihood of being admitted to the hospital, becoming disabled, missing work, or needing additional office visits.  There is no evidence that the routine physical provides any health benefits, although it does increase the number of people who are formally diagnosed with some common conditions, such as mild hypertension.<ref name="Krogsbøll2012">{{cite journal
