Founded by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] [[George Miller Sternberg]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1893, the '''Army Medical School''' (AMS) was by some reckonings the world's first school of [[public health]] and [[preventive medicine]]. (The other institution vying for this distinction is the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] (1916).) The AMS ultimately became the '''Army Medical Center''' (1923), then the '''[[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]''' (1953). 

==History==
Sternberg created the AMS by issuing "[[General Order]] 51" on June 24, 1893. The School was housed, along with the [[Army Medical Library]] in the building of the [[Army Medical Museum and Library]] (affectionately known as the "Old Pickle Factory" or "Old Red") at 7th Street and South B Street (now [[Independence Avenue (Washington D.C.)|Independence Avenue]]), SW, [[Washington, D.C.]] (This site is on the [[National Mall]] where the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[Hirshhorn Museum]] now stands.)

In 1910, the AMS relocated to 721 13th Street, NW and in 1916 to 604 Louisiana Avenue.

In 1923, the "Army Medical Center" (AMC) was created when (1) the AMS became the "Medical Department Professional Service School" (MDPSS) and (2) the MDPSS moved into "Building #40" on the grounds of the [[Walter Reed General Hospital]] (WRGH) in northern Washington, D.C. 

The historic edifice known as Building #40 was constructed at 14th and Dahlia Streets beginning in 1922 and reached completion in 1932.  This facility consists of four "Pavilions": 

*The '''North''' or '''"Vedder Pavilion"''' (named for Col. [[Edward Bright Vedder]] (1878-1952) who established polished rice extract as the proper treatment for [[beri-beri]]); 

*The '''South''' or '''"Craig Pavilion"''' (named for Col. [[Charles Franklin Craig]] (1872-1950) who in the [[Philippines]] proved (1907; with [[Percy M. Ashburn]])  [[dengue]] to be a filterable agent (virus) and later showed the mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' responsible for dengue transmission); 

*The '''East''' or '''"Sternberg Pavilion"''' (named for Gen. Sternberg (1838-1915), the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|U.S. Army Surgeon General]] and co-discoverer of the [[pneumococcus]], known as the "Father of American Bacteriology"); 

*The '''West''' or '''"Siler Pavilion"''' (named for Col. [[Joseph Franklin Siler]] (1875-1960), who in  1925 first injected dengue virus in serum into humans producing disease and "closing the loop" on dengue transmissibility). 
 
In 1947, the MDPSS became the "Army Medical Department Research and Graduate School" (AMDRGS), which in turn became the "Army Medical Service Graduate School" (AMSGS) in 1950.

In September 1951, "General Order Number 8" combined the WRGH & AMC into the present-day [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] (WRAMC).  Three years later, the research elements of this facility became the present-day [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR).
