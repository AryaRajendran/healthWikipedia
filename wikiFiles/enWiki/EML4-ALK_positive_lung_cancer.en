'''EML4-ALK positive lung cancer''' is a medical term that refers to a primary [[malignant]] [[lung]] [[tumor]] whose [[cell (biology)|cell]]s contain a characteristic abnormal configuration of [[DNA]] wherein the ''echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4'' (''[[EML4]]'') [[gene]] is fused to the ''[[anaplastic lymphoma kinase]]'' (''ALK'') [[gene]]. This abnormal [[gene fusion]] leads to the production of a [[protein]] ([[EML4-ALK]]) that appears, in many cases, to promote and maintain the malignant behavior of the [[cancer]] cells.<ref name='SodaChoi'>{{cite journal |author=Soda M, Choi YL, Enomoto M, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small-cell lung cancer |journal=Nature |volume=448 |issue=7153 |pages=561–6 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17625570 |doi=10.1038/nature05945 }}</ref>

The transforming ''EML4-ALK'' fusion gene was first reported in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell 2007 non-small-cell lung cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sasaki T, Rodig SJ, Chirieac LR, Jänne PA |title=The biology and treatment of EML4-ALK non-small cell lung cancer |journal=Eur.

==Classification==
Most lung carcinomas containing the ''EML4-ALK'' gene fusion are [[adenocarcinoma of the lung|adenocarcinomas]].

Some studies suggest that the [[papillary adenocarcinoma]] and the [[signet ring cell adenocarcinoma]]<ref name="KohKim">{{cite journal |author=Koh Y, Kim DW, Kim TM, ''et al.'' |title=Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma: suggestion for an effective screening strategy for these tumors |journal=J Thorac Oncol |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=905–12 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21358343 |doi=10.1097/JTO.0b013e3182111461 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1556-0864&volume=6&issue=5&spage=905}}</ref> variants are more likely to carry this fused gene than other histological variants.

==Epidemiology==
''EML4-ALK'' gene fusions occur almost exclusively in carcinomas arising in non-smokers.<ref name="pmid19147828">{{cite journal |author=Martelli MP, Sozzi G, Hernandez L, ''et al.'' |title=EML4-ALK rearrangement in non-small cell lung cancer and non-tumor lung tissues |journal=Am.

''EML4-ALK'' mutations rarely occur in combination with ''K-RAS'' or ''EGFR'' mutations.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of this lung cancer variant seem to mimic those of the underlying major cell type.

==Screening==
A 2011 consensus recommendation from 37 Canadian lung cancer specialists found that, as of June 2011, there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening of lung cancer speciments for ''EML4-ALK'' fusions, but that may soon change.<ref name="pmid21709590"/>
