'''Antipyretics''' {{IPA|/ænti.paɪˈrɛ.tɪks/}}; an-tee-pahy-'''ret'''-iks; from the Greek '''anti''', ''against'', and '''pyreticus''', (''pertaining to fever'') are [[drug]]s or herbs that reduce [[fever]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antipyretic |title=Definition of antipyretic|accessdate=2007-12-19 |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}</ref>  Antipyretics cause the [[hypothalamus]] to override an [[interleukin]]-induced increase in temperature. The body then works to lower the temperature, resulting in a reduction in fever.

Most antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the United States are [[ibuprofen]] and [[aspirin]], which are used primarily as [[Analgesic|pain relievers]]. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) are antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and pain relievers. There is some debate over the appropriate use of such medications, as fever is part of the body's [[immune system|immune response]] to infection{{citation-needed|date=December 2012}}.

==Non-pharmacological treatment==
[[Bathing]] or sponging with lukewarm or cool water can effectively reduce body temperature in those with [[heat illness]] but not usually in those with fever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=pedi_id/19036&source=preview&selectedTitle=10~150&anchor=H19#H19 |title=UpToDate Inc |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> The use of alcohol baths is not an appropriate cooling method, because there have been reported adverse events associated with systemic absorption of alcohol.<ref>http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/127/3/580</ref>

==Medications==
Many medications have antipyretic effects and thus are useful for fever but not heat illness, including:

* [[NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], [[ketoprofen]], and [[nimesulide]] (not marketed in the US).
* [[Aspirin]], and related salicylates like choline salicylate, magnesium salicylate, and sodium salicylate.
* [[Paracetamol]] (Acetaminophen in the US).
* [[Metamizole]], banned in over 30 countries for causing [[agranulocytosis]]
* [[Nabumetone]]
* [[Phenazone]], also known as antipyrine, available in combination with benzocaine as an [[Antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops|ear drop]] in the US.
* [[Quinine]]

===Plants===
Traditional use of higher plants with antipyretic properties is a common worldwide feature of many ethnobotanical cultural systems. In ethnobotany, plants with naturally occurring antipyretic properties are commonly referred to as [[febrifuge]]s.<ref>Schultes, R.E.; Raffauf, R.F.

===In children===
The effectiveness of [[acetaminophen]] alone as an antipyretic in children is uncertain, with some evidence showing it is no better than physical methods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meremikwu M, Oyo-Ita A |title=Paracetamol for treating fever in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003676 |year=2002 |pmid=12076499 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003676 |quote=Trial evidence that paracetamol has a superior antipyretic effect than placebo is inconclusive. |editor1-last=Meremikwu |editor1-first=Martin M}}</ref> Therapies involving alternating doses of [[acetaminophen]] and [[ibuprofen]] have shown greater antipyretic effect than either drug alone.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpedi.160.2.197 |author=E.
