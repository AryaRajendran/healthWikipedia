Men who choose to wear a brassiere may broadly be divided into two categories, depending on whether or not the brassiere is worn primarily for utilitarian purposes. Some men who have large breasts as a result of [[obesity]] or [[gynecomastia]] may choose to wear a brassiere to provide support for their [[breast]]s and to flatten their appearance. Other men wear bras for [[cross-dressing]], for sexual purposes such as [[transvestic fetishism]] or [[Feminization#Forced Feminization as a sexual practice|feminization]], or as a form of [[Submissive (BDSM)|submission]] to their partner.<ref>[http://www.brassiered.com/ brassiered: a complete guide to brassiere discipline]</ref> [[Petticoat discipline]] may also involve male bra wear.<ref>[http://www.petticoated.com/PDQ.august.06.html Brassiered Husband]</ref> Additionally, some male athletes (more specifically runners) may choose to wear a sports bra under their shirts in order to prevent a common medical condition called [[jogger's nipple]], also known as nipple chafing. This condition is caused by excessive rubbing of wet (sweat soaked) material over one's nipples. The condition, often very painful, can be prevented by wearing a sports bra.

Although some bras for men have been developed, they often differ only superficially from their female counterparts.<ref name="Men Who Need Chest Support">{{cite web | last =Bumgardner  | first =Wendy | title=Men Who Need Chest Support | publisher=[[About.com]] | date=July 26, 2007 | url =http://walking.about.com/od/sportsbras/a/sensmensbra.htm | accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref><ref>[http://www.enell.com/products_for_men.php# Enell Sports Bra: for men]</ref> There is sometimes no medical necessity for men to wear bras, and the same considerations for and against apply to both genders.<ref>[http://www.007b.com/bra-men.php Female Intelligence Agency: Men and bras]</ref>
