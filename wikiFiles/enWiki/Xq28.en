'''Xq28''' is a [[chromosome band]] and [[genetic marker]] situated at the tip of the [[X chromosome]] which has been studied since at least 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6930669 |year=1980 |last1=Pai |first1=GS |last2=Sprenkle |first2=JA |last3=Do |first3=TT |last4=Mareni |first4=CE |last5=Migeon |first5=BR |title=Localization of loci for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and biochemical evidence of nonrandom X chromosome expression from studies of a human X-autosome translocation |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=2810–3 |pmc=349494 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.77.5.2810|bibcode = 1980PNAS...77.2810P }}</ref> The band contains three distinct regions, totaling about 8 Mb of genetic information.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1996PNAS...93.1298D |jstor=38791 |title=A Compositional Map of Human Chromosome Band Xq28 |author1=De Sario |first1=Albertina |last2=Geigl |first2=Eva-Maria |last3=Palmieri |first3=Giuseppe |last4=d'Urso |first4=Michele |last5=Bernardi |first5=Giorgio |volume=93 |year=1996 |pages=1298–302 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.3.1298 |pmid=8577758 |issue=3 |pmc=40074}}</ref> Xq28 contains the 12 genes of the [[melanoma-associated antigen]] (MAGE) family,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8575766 |year=1995 |last1=Rogner |first1=UC |last2=Wilke |first2=K |last3=Steck |first3=E |last4=Korn |first4=B |last5=Poustka |first5=A |title=The melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) family is clustered in the chromosomal band Xq28 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=725–31 |doi=10.1006/geno.1995.9945 |journal=Genomics}}</ref> of which [[MAGEA11]] has been identified as a coregulator for the [[androgen receptor]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21789088 |year=2010 |last1=Wilson |first1=EM |title=Androgen receptor molecular biology and potential targets in prostate cancer |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=105–17 |doi=10.1177/1756287210372380 |pmc=3126091 |journal=Therapeutic advances in urology}}</ref> Duplications of certain genes within Xq28, namely [[MECP2]] and [[IRAK1]], have been associated with phenotypes including anxiety and autism.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=22231481 |year=2012 |last1=Samaco |first1=RC |last2=Mandel-Brehm |first2=C |last3=McGraw |first3=CM |last4=Shaw |first4=CA |last5=McGill |first5=BE |last6=Zoghbi |first6=HY |title=Crh and Oprm1 mediate anxiety-related behavior and social approach in a mouse model of MECP2 duplication syndrome |doi=10.1038/ng.1066 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=206–11}}</ref>

The marker came to the public eye in [[1993 in science|1993]] when studies by [[Dean Hamer]] and others indicated a link between the Xq28 marker and male [[homosexuality]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.8332896 |title=A linkage between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation |year=1993 |last1=Hamer |first1=D. |last2=Hu |first2=S |last3=Magnuson |first3=V. |last4=Hu |first4=N |last5=Pattatucci |first5=A. |journal=Science |volume=261 |issue=5119 |pages=321–7 |pmid=8332896|bibcode = 1993Sci...261..321H }}</ref> but the original study's results have been disputed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/325979.stm Doubt cast on 'gay gene'], April 23, 1999, [[BBC News]]</ref>

==1993 study==
The 1993 study by [[Dean Hamer|Hamer]] examined 114 families of [[Homosexuality|gay]] men in [[Italy]] and found increased rates of homosexuality among maternal uncles and cousins, but not among paternal relatives. [[Genetic linkage]] was studied in 40 of the families, in which there were two gay brothers. A correlation to Xq28 and other [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] markers was found in approximately 64% of the cases. A similar study by the same team conducted in 1995, again based on Italian material corroborated these results, but failed to find a link to the Xq28 gene among homosexual females.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng1195-248 |title=Linkage between sexual orientation and chromosome Xq28 in males but not in females |year=1995 |last1=Hu |first1=Stella |last2=Pattatucci |first2=Angela M.

==1999 study==
A further study of these results in [[1999 in science|1999]] disputed the results. Studying [[Canada|Canadian]] material consisting of 52 pairs of gay brothers, George Rice and others found no statistically significant linkage in [[allele]]s and [[haplotype]]s and concluded against an [[X chromosome|X-linked]] male homosexuality gene.

When the disputing study was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Hamer responded by defending his original results and cited possible problems with how Rice's team
selected their study subjects.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.284.5414.571 |title=Discovery of 'Gay Gene' Questioned |year=1999 |last1=Wickelgren |first1=I. |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5414 |pages=571 |pmid=10328731}}</ref>
