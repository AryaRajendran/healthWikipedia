'''Tetraethyllead''' (common name '''tetraethyl lead'''), abbreviated '''TEL''', is an [[organolead compound]] with the formula ([[ethyl group|CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>]])<sub>4</sub>[[lead|Pb]]. It was mixed with [[gasoline]] (petrol) beginning in the 1920s as an inexpensive [[Octane rating|octane]] booster which allowed [[Compression ratio|engine compression]] to be raised substantially, which in turn increased vehicle performance and fuel economy.<ref name=BMJ1928>{{cite journal|last=|first=|title=TETRA-ETHYL LEAD AS AN ADDITION TO PETROL|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=3504|pages=366|date=1928-03-03|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3504.366|url=}}</ref><ref>{{citation|work=Popular Science|page=94|edition=October 1987|url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=oAAAAAAAMBAJ&&pg=PA94}}</ref> TEL was phased out starting in the US in the mid-1970s because of its [[Lead poisoning|neurotoxicity]] and its damaging effect on [[Catalytic converter#Catalyst poisoning and deactivation|catalytic converters]]. It is still used as an additive in [[Avgas|aviation fuel]] for [[Internal combustion engine|piston engine]]-powered [[Aircraft#Propeller driven|aircraft]], and also in high-octane automotive racing fuels.

==In motor fuel==
Tetraethyl lead was extensively used as an [[gasoline additive|additive to gasoline]], wherein it served as an effective [[antiknock agent]] and prevented exhaust valve and [[valve seat|seat]] wear.

===As valve wear preventive===
Tetraethyl lead works as a buffer against microwelds forming between the hot exhaust valves and their [[Valve seat|seats]].<ref>[http://www.imperialclub.com/Repair/Lit/Master/291/page13.htm Engine Performance Facts and Fixes: No-Lead Fuel]</ref> Once these valves reopen, the microwelds pull apart and leave the valves with a rough surface that would abrade the seats, leading to valve recession. When lead began to be phased out of motor fuel, the automotive industry began specifying hardened valve seats and upgraded exhaust valve materials to prevent valve recession without lead.<ref>[http://www.imperialclub.com/Repair/Lit/Master/302/page04.htm 1973 Cleaner Air System Highlights: Hardened exhaust valve seats]</ref>

===As antiknock agent===
A gasoline-fueled reciprocating engine requires fuel of sufficient [[octane rating]] to prevent uncontrolled combustion known as [[engine knocking]] ("knock" or "ping").<ref name="Seyferth" /> Antiknock agents allow the use of higher [[compression ratio]]s for greater [[fuel efficiency|efficiency]]<ref name="SAEtrans-hce1959">Caris, D. F. and Nelson, E. E. (1959). A New Look at High Compression Engines SAE Trans.</ref> and peak [[power (physics)|power]]. Adding varying amounts of TEL to gasoline allowed easy, inexpensive control of octane ratings; aviation spirits used in WWII reached 150 octane to enable supercharged engines such as the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon]] to produce 1500 HP at altitude.<ref>I Kept No Diary. Air Commodore F.R. Banks, 1978, ISBN 0-904543-9-7</ref> In military aviation, TEL manipulation allowed a range of different fuels to be tailored for particular flight conditions, and ease and safety of handling.

The use of TEL in gasoline started in the US, while in [[Europe]], [[alcohol]] was initially used. The advantages of leaded gasoline &mdash; its higher energy content and storage quality &mdash; eventually led to a universal switch to leaded fuel. One of the greatest advantages of TEL over other antiknock agents or the use of high-octane blend stocks is the very low concentrations needed. Typical formulations called for 1 part of prepared TEL to 1260 parts untreated gasoline. Competing antiknock agents must be used in greater amounts, often reducing the energy content of the gasoline.


===Phaseout and ban===
In most industrialised countries, a phaseout of TEL from motor fuels was completed by the early 2000s because of concerns over air and soil lead levels  and the [[Bioaccumulation|accumulative]] neurotoxicity [[Lead poisoning|of lead]]. Leaded fuel also spoils [[catalytic converter]]s, which were introduced in the 1970s to meet tightening [[Vehicle emissions control|emissions regulations]]. The need for TEL was lessened by several advances in automotive engineering and petroleum chemistry. Safer methods for making higher octane blending stocks such as [[reformate]] and [[iso-octane]] reduced the need to rely on TEL, as did other antiknock additives of varying toxicity  including metallic compounds such as [[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl|MMT]]; [[Oxygenate|oxygenates]] including [[MTBE]], [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|TAME]], and [[ETBE]].

As of June 2011, unleaded automotive gasoline is available almost universally throughout the world and the only countries in which leaded gasoline is the only type available are [[Burma]] and [[Afghanistan]]; Leaded gasoline also remains available in [[Algeria]], [[Georgia_(country)|Georgia]], [[Iraq]], [[North Korea]], and [[Yemen]].<ref name=leadgroup>{{cite web | url = http://www.lead.org.au/fs/fst27.html | title = Countries where Leaded Petrol is Possibly Still Sold for Road Use | date = 2011-06-17 | author = Robert Taylor | publisher = The LEAD Group}}</ref> Lead-replacement additives were scientifically tested and some were approved by the Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs at the UK's [[Motor Industry Research Association]] in 1999. In Europe, Professor [[Derek Bryce-Smith]] was among the first to highlight the potential dangers of TEL and became a leading campaigner for removal of lead additives from petrol.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/jul/19/derek-bryce-smith-obituary Obituary: Derek Bryce Smith]</ref> However, leaded motor fuel re-entered the [[United Kingdom|UK]] market in small quantities from 2000 in response to lobbying from classic-car organisations who contended their vehicles would be rendered useless without leaded fuel. The lead content is up to 0.15&nbsp;grams per litre, and Bayford & Co are the only wholesale supplier.<ref name = fbhvc>{{cite web | url = http://www.fbhvc.co.uk/fuel-information/ | title = Fuel Information | publisher = Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs}}</ref>

Vehicles designed and built to run on leaded fuel may require modification to run on unleaded gasoline. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed to compensate for the relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of [[Hardening (metallurgy)|hardened]] exhaust valves and seats. Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder head gaskets and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons. The availability of high-octane unleaded gasolines has reduced or eliminated the need to alter engines' compression ratios.

Leaded-fuel bans for road vehicles came into effect as follows:

====In race vehicles====
Until recently, leaded fuel was used in professional auto racing. [[NASCAR]] switched to unleaded fuel in 2008 after years of research, spurred when blood tests of NASCAR teams revealed elevated blood lead levels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neil | pmid = 16361219 | first1 = J | year = 2006 | pages = 67–71 | issue = 2 | last2 = Steele | volume = 3 | journal = Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene | first2 = G | last3 = McNair | first3 = CS | last4 = Matusiak | first4 = MM | last5 = Madlem | first5 = J | title = Blood lead levels in NASCAR Nextel Cup Teams | doi = 10.1080/15459620500471221}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://nascar.about.com/od/cars/a/unleaded08.htm | title = NASCAR to Use Unleaded Fuel in 2008}}</ref> An initial test in 2005 with usually dependable motors had led to five cars retiring with engine troubles in a single race.<ref>http://www.startribune.com/sports/motorsports/12092486.html</ref>

====In aviation fuel====
TEL remains an ingredient of 100 [[octane rating|octane]] [[avgas]] for piston-engine aircraft. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and others are working on an economically feasible replacement for leaded avgas. The current formulation of 100LL (low lead) aviation gasoline contains 2.12 grams of TEL per gallon, half the amount of the previous 100 octane avgas (at 4.24 grams per gallon),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/regulatory/reglead.html | title = Issues Related to Lead in Avgas |  publisher = Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association}}</ref> but far more than the 0.1 gram per gallon permitted in automotive leaded gasoline or the 0.001 grams per gallon in automotive unleaded gasoline sold in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.autofuelstc.com/autofuelstc/pa/Information.html | title = Modifications / Octane / Lead Content / Fuel Specs / Limitations / Certification | publisher = Petersen Aviation Inc}}</ref>

====Alternative antiknock agents====
Antiknock agents are classed as "high-percentage" additives, such as alcohol, and "low-percentage" additives based on heavy elements. Since the main problem with TEL is its lead content, many alternative additives that contain less poisonous metals have been examined. A manganese-carrying additive, [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT or methylcymantrene), was used for a time as an antiknock agent, though its safety is controversial and it has been the subject of bans and lawsuits. [[Ferrocene]], an organometallic compound of [[iron]], has also been reported{{By whom|date=August 2011}} as an effective antiknock agent.

High-percentage additives are organic compounds that do not contain metals, but require much higher blending ratios, such as 20–30% for [[benzene]] and ethanol. It had also been established by 1921 that [[ethanol]] was an effective antiknock agent, but TEL was introduced instead mainly for commercial reasons.<ref name="Kitman"/> [[Oxygenate]]s such as [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|TAME]] derived from natural gas, [[MTBE]] made from methanol, and ethanol-derived [[ETBE]], have largely supplanted TEL. MTBE has environmental risks of its own and there are also bans on its use. ETBE requires more expensive [[ethanol]] as a starting material.

Improvements of the gasoline itself decrease the need for added antiknock agents. Synthetic [[iso-octane]] and [[alkylate]] are examples of such blending stocks. Benzene and other high-octane [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatics]] can be also blended to raise the octane number, but they are disfavored today because of toxicity and carcinogenicity.

==Synthesis and properties==
TEL is produced by reacting [[chloroethane]] with a [[sodium]]–[[lead]] [[alloy]].<ref name="Seyferth">{{cite journal | author = Seyferth, D. | title = The Rise and Fall of Tetraethyllead. 2 | journal = [[Organometallics]] | year = 2003 | volume = 22 | pages = 5154–5178 | doi = 10.1021/om030621b | issue = 25}}</ref>

: 4 NaPb + 4 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl  →  (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Pb + 4 NaCl + 3 Pb

Despite decades of research, no reactions were found to improve upon this rather difficult process that involves metallic sodium. The product, TEL, is a [[Viscosity|viscous]] colorless [[liquid]]. Because TEL is charge neutral and contains an exterior of alkyl groups, it is highly [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and soluble in petrol (gasoline).

A process with [[lithium]] was developed, but never put into practice. A related compound, tetramethyllead, was commercially produced by a different electrolytic reaction.<ref name = Seyferth/>

==Reactions==
A noteworthy feature of TEL is the weakness of its four C–Pb bonds. At the temperatures found in [[internal combustion engine]]s,{{nowrap|(CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Pb}} decomposes completely into lead and lead oxides as well as combustible, short-lived ethyl [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]]s. Lead and lead oxide scavenge [[Radical (chemistry)|radical intermediates]] in [[combustion]] reactions. This prevents ignition of unburnt fuel during the engine's exhaust stroke.<ref name="Seyferth" /> Lead itself is the reactive antiknock agent, and TEL serves as a gasoline-soluble lead carrier.<ref name="Seyferth" /> When (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Pb burns, it produces not only carbon dioxide and water, but also lead:

: (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Pb  +  13 O<sub>2</sub>  →  8 CO<sub>2</sub>  +  10 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  Pb

This lead can oxidize further to give species such as [[lead(II) oxide]]:

: 2 Pb  + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 PbO

The Pb and PbO would quickly over-accumulate and destroy an engine. For this reason, the lead scavengers [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] and [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]] are used in conjunction with TEL—these agents form volatile [[lead(II) bromide]] and [[lead(II) chloride]], respectively, which are flushed from the engine and into the air.

==Formulation of ethyl fluid==
[[File:EthylCorporationSign.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sign on an antique gasoline pump advertising tetraethyllead by the Ethyl Corporation]]
TEL was supplied for mixing with raw gasoline in the form of '''ethyl fluid''', which was TEL blended together with the lead scavengers [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] and [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]]. Ethyl fluid also contained a reddish dye to distinguish treated from untreated gasoline and discourage the use of leaded gasoline for other purposes such as cleaning.

Ethyl fluid was added to gasoline at rate of 1:1260, usually at the refinery.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Because of the widespread use and toxic nature of ethyl fluid, the [[Ethyl Corporation]] developed an expertise in its safe handling. In the 1920s, before safety procedures were yet developed, some 17 workers for the Ethyl Corporation and Standard Oil died {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} from the effects of exposure to lead.

The formula for ethyl fluid is:<ref name="Seyferth" />

*Tetraethyllead          61.45%
*[[1,2-Dibromoethane]]        17.85%
*[[1,2-Dichloroethane]]       18.80%
*Inerts & dye             1.90%

Dibromoethane and dichloroethane act in a synergistic manner, where a particular mixing ratio provides the best lead scavenging ability.<ref name="Seyferth" />

==Toxicity==
Lead pollution from engine exhaust is dispersed into the air and into the vicinity of roads and easily inhaled. Contact with concentrated TEL leads to acute [[lead poisoning]]:

Lead is a [[toxic metal]] that accumulates in the body and is associated with subtle and insidious [[neurotoxic]] effects especially at low exposure levels, such as low IQ and antisocial behavior.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rachel.org/files/document/Bone_Lead_Levels_and_Delinquent_Behavior.pdf |title=Bone Lead Levels and Delinquent Behavior |author=Julie A.

 |date=July 1998 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref> It has particularly harmful effects on children. These concerns eventually led to the ban on TEL in automobile gasoline in many countries. Some neurologists have speculated that the lead phaseout may have caused average IQ levels to rise by several points in the US (by reducing cumulative brain damage throughout the population, especially in the young). For the entire US population, during and after the TEL phaseout, the mean blood lead level dropped from 16 μg/dL in 1976 to only 3 μg/dL in 1991.<ref name="Reyes" /> The US Centers for Disease Control considered blood lead levels "elevated" when they were above 10 μg/dL. Lead exposure affects the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) such that a blood lead level of 30 μg/dL is associated with a 6.9-point reduction of IQ, with most reduction (3.9 points) occurring below 10 μg/dL.<ref name="Lanphear 2005">{{cite doi|10.1289/ehp.7688}}</ref>

A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: taking into account a 22-year time lag, the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve.<ref name="Reyes">Reyes, J. W. (2007). [http://www.amherst.edu/~jwreyes/papers/LeadCrimeNBERWP13097.pdf "The Impact of Childhood Lead Exposure on Crime".

Although leaded gasoline is largely gone in North America, it has left high concentrations of lead in the soil adjacent to roads that were constructed prior to its phaseout. Children are particularly at risk if they consume this.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline |title=America's Real Criminal Element: Lead |author=Kevin Drum |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=January/February 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2013 }}</ref>

The toxicity of concentrated TEL was recognized early on, as lead had been recognized since the 19th century as a dangerous substance which could cause [[lead poisoning]].<ref name=Kovarik2005/> In 1924, a public controversy arose over the "loony gas," after several workers died and others went insane in a refinery in New Jersey and a DuPont facility in Ohio.<ref name=Kovarik2005/>  However, for two years prior to this controversy, several public health experts including [[Alice Hamilton]] engaged Midgley and Kettering with letters warning of the dangers to public health of the proposed plan.<ref name=Kovarik2005/> After the death of the workers, dozens of newspapers reported on the issue.<ref name=Kovarik2005/><ref>[http://yarchive.net/chem/tetraethyl_lead.html TEL-related deaths]</ref> In 1925, the sales of TEL were suspended for one year to conduct a hazard assessment.<ref name="Seyferth" /><ref name="Kitman"/>

The U.S. Public Health Service conducted a conference in 1925. The conference was initially expected to last for several days, but reportedly the conference decided that evaluating presentations on alternative anti-knock agents was not "its province", so it lasted a single day.<ref name=Kovarik2005/> Kettering and Midgley stated that no alternatives for anti-knocking were available, although private memos showed discussion of such agents.<ref name=Kovarik2005/> One commonly discussed agent was ethanol, although it was not as cheap.<ref name=Kovarik2005/> The Public Health Service created a committee which reviewed a government-sponsored study of workers and an Ethyl lab test, and concluded that while leaded gasoline should not be banned, it should continue to be investigated.<ref name=Kovarik2005/> The low concentrations present in gasoline and exhaust were not perceived as immediately dangerous. A U.S. Surgeon General committee issued a report in 1926 that concluded there was no real evidence that the sale of TEL was hazardous to human health but urged further study.<ref name="Kitman"/> In the years that followed, research was heavily funded by the lead industry; in 1943, Randolph Byers found children with lead poisoning had behavior problems, but he was threatened with a lawsuit and the research ended.<ref name=Kovarik2005/>

In the late 1920s, Dr. Robert Kehoe of the University of Cincinnati was the Ethyl Corporation's chief medical consultant. In 1928, Dr. Kehoe expressed the opinion that there was no basis for concluding that leaded fuels posed any health threat.<ref name="Kitman" /> He convinced the Surgeon General that the dose–response relationship of lead was "no effect" below a certain threshold.<ref>Bryson, Christopher (2004). ''The Fluoride Deception'', p. 41. Seven Stories Press. Citing historian Lynne Snyder.</ref> As the head of Kettering Laboratories for many years, Kehoe would become a chief promoter of the safety of TEL, an influence that did not begin to wane until about the early 1960s. But by the 1970s, the general opinion of the safety of TEL would change, and by 1976 the U.S. government would begin to require the phaseout of this product.

As early as the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Clair Cameron Patterson|Clair Patterson]] accidentally discovered the pollution caused by TEL in the environment while determining the age of the earth. As he attempted to measure lead content of very old rocks, and the time it took uranium to decay into lead, the readings were made inaccurate by lead in the environment that contaminated his samples. He was then forced to work in a [[clean room]] to keep his samples uncontaminated by environmental pollution of lead. After coming up with a fairly accurate estimate of the age of the earth, he turned to investigating the lead contamination problem by examining ice cores from countries such as [[Greenland]]. He realized that the lead contamination in the environment dated from about the time that TEL became widely used as a fuel additive in gasoline. Being aware of the health dangers posed by lead and suspicious of the pollution caused by TEL, he became one of the earliest and most effective opponents of its use.<ref>Bryson, Bill (2003).

In the 1960s the first clinical works were published proving the toxicity of this compound in humans, e.g. by [[Mirosław Jan Stasik]].<ref>Stasik et al.: Acute Tetraethyllead Poisoning. Arch. Toxikol. 24. 283-291,1969</ref>

In the 1970s [[Herbert Needleman]] found that higher blood levels in children were correlated with decreased school performance. Needleman was repeatedly accused of scientific misconduct by individuals within the lead industry, but he was eventually cleared by a scientific advisory council.<ref name=Kovarik2005/>

In the U.S. in 1972, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] launched an initiative to phase out leaded gasoline based on a regulation under the authority of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Extension of 1970]]. Ethyl Corp's response was to sue the EPA. Although the EPA's regulation was initially dismissed,<ref name=Kovarik2005/> the EPA won the case on appeal, so the TEL phaseout began in 1976 and was completed by 1986. A 1994 study indicated that the concentration of lead in the blood of the U.S. population had dropped 78% from 1976 to 1991.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pirkle, J. L.; Brody, D. J.; Gunter, E.

By 2000, the TEL industry had moved the major portion of their sales to developing countries whose governments they lobbied against phasing out leaded gasoline.<ref name="Kitman"/> Leaded gasoline was withdrawn entirely from the European Union market on 1 January 2000, although it had been banned much earlier in most member states. Other countries also phased out TEL.<ref name=meca2003>{{cite web|url=http://www.meca.org/galleries/default-file/lead0103_%28final%29.pdf |title=The Case for Banning Lead in Gasoline |date=January 2003 |publisher=Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA) |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>
