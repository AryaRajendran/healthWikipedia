'''Willis-Ekbom disease''' ('''WED'''), commonly known as '''Restless Legs Syndrome''' ('''RLS'''), is a [[neurological disorder]] characterized by an irresistible urge to move one's body to stop uncomfortable or odd sensations.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=2103–9 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp021288 |title=Restless Legs Syndrome |year=2003 |last1=Earley |first1=Christopher J. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=348 |issue=21 |pmid=12761367}}</ref> It most commonly affects the legs, but can affect the arms, torso, head, and even [[phantom limb]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=569–70 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2008.152652 |title=Bilateral restless legs affecting a phantom limb, treated with dopamine agonists |year=2009 |last1=Skidmore |first1=F M |last2=Drago |first2=V. |last3=Foster |first3=P S |last4=Heilman |first4=K M |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=80 |issue=5 |pmid=19372293}}</ref> Moving the affected body part modulates the sensations, providing temporary relief. 

WED/RLS sensations range from pain or an aching in the muscles, to "an itch you can't scratch", an unpleasant "tickle that won't stop", or even a "crawling" feeling. The sensations typically begin or intensify during quiet wakefulness, such as when relaxing, reading, studying, or trying to sleep.<ref name=pmid14592341>{{cite journal |pages=101–19 |doi=10.1016/S1389-9457(03)00010-8 |title=Restless legs syndrome: diagnostic criteria, special considerations, and epidemiology A report from the restless legs syndrome diagnosis and epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health |year=2003 |last1=Allen |first1=R |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |pmid=14592341 |last2=Picchietti |first2=D |last3=Hening |first3=WA |last4=Trenkwalder |first4=C |last5=Walters |first5=AS |last6=Montplaisi |first6=J |author7=Restless Legs Syndrome Diagnosis and Epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health |author8=International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group}}</ref> Additionally, most individuals with WED/RLS suffer from [[periodic limb movement disorder]] (limbs jerking during sleep), which is an objective physiologic marker of the disorder and is associated with sleep disruption.<ref name="pmid17634447"/> 

Some controversy surrounds the marketing of drug treatments for WED/RLS.  It is a "spectrum" disease with some people experiencing only a minor annoyance and others suffering major disruption of sleep and significant impairments in quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=807–15 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.07.007 |title=Restless legs syndrome: Understanding its consequences and the need for better treatment |year=2010 |last1=Earley |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Silber |first2=Michael H. |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=11 |issue=9 |pmid=20817595}}</ref>

The sensations—and the need to move—may return immediately after ceasing movement or at a later time. WED/RLS may start at any age, including childhood, and is a progressive disease for some, while the symptoms may remit in others.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=617–22 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2010.67 |title=Family Study of Restless Legs Syndrome in Quebec, Canada: Clinical Characterization of 671 Familial Cases |year=2010 |last1=Xiong |first1=L. |last2=Montplaisir |first2=J. |last3=Desautels |first3=A. |last4=Barhdadi |first4=A. |last5=Turecki |first5=G. |last6=Levchenko |first6=A. |last7=Thibodeau |first7=P. |last8=Dube |first8=M.

*"An urge to move, usually due to uncomfortable sensations that occur primarily in the legs, but occasionally in the arms or elsewhere.
:The sensations are unusual and unlike other common sensations. Those with WED/RLS have a hard time describing them, using words like: uncomfortable, painful, 'antsy', electrical, creeping, itching, [[Paresthesia|pins and needles]], pulling, crawling, and numbness. It is sometimes described similar to a limb 'falling asleep' or an exaggerated sense of positional awareness of the affected area.  The sensation and the urge can occur in any body part; the most cited location is legs, followed by arms. Some people have little or no sensation, yet still have a strong urge to move.
*"Motor restlessness, expressed as activity, which relieves the urge to move.
:Movement usually brings immediate relief, although temporary and partial. Walking is most common; however, stretching, yoga, biking, or other physical activity may relieve the symptoms. Continuous, fast up-and-down movements of the leg, and/or rapidly moving the legs toward then away from each other, may keep sensations at bay without having to walk. Specific movements may be unique to each person.
*"Worsening of symptoms by relaxation.
:Sitting or lying down (reading, plane ride, watching TV) can trigger the sensations and urge to move. Severity depends on the severity of the person's WED/RLS, the degree of restfulness, duration of the inactivity, etc.
*"Variability over the course of the day-night cycle, with symptoms worse in the evening and early in the night.
:Some experience WED/RLS only at bedtime, while others experience it throughout the day and night. Most sufferers experience the worst symptoms in the evening and the least in the morning.
*"Restless legs feel similar to the urge to yawn, situated in the legs or arms." These symptoms of RLS can make sleeping difficult for many patients and a recent poll shows the presence of significant daytime difficulties resulting from this condition.  These problems range from being late for work, and missing work or events because of drowsiness.  Patients with WED/RLS who responded reported driving while drowsy more than patients without WED/RLS.  These daytime difficulties can translate into safety, social and economic issues for the patient and for society.

===NIH criteria===
In 2003, a [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) panel modified their criteria to include the following:
#An urge to move the limbs with or without sensations.
#Improvement with activity.  Many patients find relief when moving and the relief continues while they are moving.  In more severe WED/RLS this relief of symptoms may not be complete or the symptoms may reappear when the movement ceases.
#Worsening at rest.  Patients may describe being the most affected when sitting for a long period of time, such as when traveling in a car or airplane, attending a meeting, or watching a performance.  An increased level of mental awareness may help reduce these symptoms.
#Worsening in the evening or night.<ref name=pmid14592341/>  Patients with mild or moderate WED/RLS show a clear [[circadian rhythm]] to their symptoms, with an increase in sensory symptoms and restlessness in the evening and into the night.

=== Primary and secondary WED/RLS ===
WED/RLS is categorized as either primary or secondary.

*Primary WED/RLS is considered [[idiopathic]] or with no known cause. Primary WED/RLS usually begins slowly, before approximately 40–45 years of age and may disappear for months or even years. It is often progressive and gets worse with age. WED/RLS in children is often misdiagnosed as [[growing pains]].
*Secondary WED/RLS often has a sudden onset after age 40, and may be daily from the beginning. It is most associated with specific medical conditions or the use of certain drugs (see below).

==Research into causes and contributing factors==
===Disease mechanism===
Most research on the disease mechanism of Willis-Ekbom Disease/restless legs syndrome has focused on the [[dopamine]] and [[Human iron metabolism|iron system]].<ref name="pmid15222997">{{cite journal |pages=385–91 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2004.01.012 |title=Dopamine and iron in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS) |year=2004 |last1=Allen |first1=R |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=5 |issue=4 |pmid=15222997}}</ref><ref name="pmid16832090">{{cite journal |pages=125–130 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000223316.53428.c9 |title=Restless legs syndrome: Revisiting the dopamine hypothesis from the spinal cord perspective |year=2006 |last1=Clemens |first1=S. |journal=Neurology |volume=67 |pmid=16832090 |last2=Rye |first2=D |last3=Hochman |first3=S |issue=1}}</ref> These hypotheses are based on the observation that iron and [[levodopa]], a [[pro-drug]] of dopamine that can cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and is metabolized in the brain into dopamine (as well as other mono-amine neurotransmitters of the catecholamine class) can be used to treat RLS, levodopa being a medicine for treating hypodopaminergic (low dopamine) conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]], and also on findings from functional brain imaging (such as [[positron emission tomography]] and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]), [[autopsy]] series and [[animal experiments]].<ref name="pmid16740411">{{cite journal |pages=458–61 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2005.11.009 |title=MRI-determined regional brain iron concentrations in early- and late-onset restless legs syndrome |year=2006 |last1=Earley |first1=C |last2=Bbarker |first2=P |last3=Horska |first3=A |last4=Allen |first4=R |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=7 |issue=5 |pmid=16740411}}</ref> Differences in dopamine- and iron-related markers have also been demonstrated in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of individuals with RLS.<ref name="pmid18226951">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2007.11.012 |title=Abnormally increased CSF 3-Ortho-methyldopa (3-OMD) in untreated restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients indicates more severe disease and possibly abnormally increased dopamine synthesis |year=2009 |last1=Allen |first1=Richard P. |last2=Connor |first2=James R. |last3=Hyland |first3=Keith |last4=Earley |first4=Christopher J. |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=10 |pages=123–128 |pmid=18226951 |issue=1 |pmc=2655320}}</ref> A connection between these two systems is demonstrated by the finding of low iron levels in the [[substantia nigra]] of RLS patients, although other areas may also be involved.<ref name="pmid18442125">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mds.22070 |title=Multiregional brain iron deficiency in restless legs syndrome |year=2008 |last1=Godau |first1=Jana |last2=Klose |first2=Uwe |last3=Di Santo |first3=Adriana |last4=Schweitzer |first4=Katherine |last5=Berg |first5=Daniela |journal=Movement Disorders |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=1184–1187 |pmid=18442125}}</ref>

===Associated medical conditions, medications and life style factors===
The most commonly associated medical condition is [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] (specifically blood [[ferritin]] below 50&nbsp;µg/L<ref name="pmid10905782">{{cite journal |pmid=10905782 |year=2000 |title=Restless legs syndrome: detection and management in primary care.

An association has been observed between [[ADHD]], and WED/RLS or [[periodic limb movement disorder]]. Both conditions appear to have links to dysfunctions related to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]], and common medications for both conditions among other systems, affect dopamine levels in the brain.<ref>[http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/other_disorders_associated_with_attention-deficit_disorder_000030_5.htm Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – Other Disorders Associated with ADHD], University of Maryland Medical Center.</ref> A 2005 study suggested that up to 44% of ADHD sufferers had [[comorbid]] (i.e. coexisting) RLS, and up to 26% of RLS sufferers had confirmed ADHD or symptoms of the condition.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16218085 |year=2005 |last1=Cortese |first1=S |last2=Konofal |first2=E |last3=Lecendreux |first3=M |last4=Arnulf |first4=I |last5=Mouren |first5=MC |last6=Darra |first6=F |last7=Dalla Bernardina |first7=B |title=Restless legs syndrome and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A review of the literature |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1007–13 |journal=Sleep}}</ref> A 2009 study updated this to report that 39% of RLS sufferers also might have ADHD compared to 14% of [[Clinical control group|controls]] and that those showing signs of both had more severe RLS, suggesting that perhaps either the difficulties of WED/RLS and low sleep quality caused ADHD-like distraction or that dopamine was a possible common factor and its improvement helped both, and that RLS sufferers might wish to consider ADHD testing as well, but cautioned that neither condition was proven as the cause of the other.

Certain medications may cause or worsen WED/RLS, or cause it secondarily, including: 
* some [[antiemetic]]s (antidopaminergic ones)
* certain [[antihistamines]] (often in [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] cold medications)
* many [[antidepressants]] (both older [[tricyclics|TCAs]] and newer [[SSRI]]s)<ref>{{cite journal |pages=70–5 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.02.006 |title=Restless legs syndrome as side effect of second generation antidepressants |year=2008 |last1=Rottach |first1=K |last2=Schaner |first2=B |last3=Kirch |first3=M |last4=Zivotofsky |first4=A |last5=Teufel |first5=L |last6=Gallwitz |first6=T |last7=Messer |first7=T |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=43 |pmid=18468624 |issue=1}}</ref>
* [[antipsychotic]]s and certain [[anticonvulsant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* a [[rebound effect]] of sedative-hypnotic drugs such as a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] from discontinuing benzodiazepine tranquillizers or sleeping pills.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=19–28 |doi=10.1016/0740-5472(91)90023-4 |title=Protracted withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines |year=1991 |last1=Ashton |first1=H |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment |volume=8 |pmid=1675688 |issue=1–2}}</ref>
* [[Hypoglycemia]] has also been found to worsen WED/RLS symptoms.<ref name="pmid9613772">{{cite journal |pages=619–20 |doi=10.1002/mds.870130349 |title=Postprandial (Reactive) hypoglycemia and restless leg syndrome: Related neurologic disorders? |year=2004 |last1=Kurlan |first1=Roger |journal=Movement Disorders |volume=13 |issue=3 |pmid=9613772}}</ref>
* Opioid detoxification has been associated with provocation of WED/RLS-like symptoms during withdrawal (opiate withdrawal may also "trigger" the syndrome if the patient already has RLS).<ref>{{cite journal |pages=70–2 |doi=10.1055/s-2003-39047 |title=Transient Restless Legs-like Syndrome as a Complication of Opiate Withrawal |year=2003 |last1=Scherbaum |first1=N. |last2=Stüper |first2=B. |last3=Bonnet |first3=U. |last4=Gastpar |first4=M. |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=36 |issue=2 |pmid=12734764}}</ref>

Both primary and secondary WED/RLS can be worsened by surgery of any kind; however, back surgery or injury can be associated with causing RLS.<ref name="pmid15830971">{{cite journal |pages=69–70 |doi=10.1007/3-211-27458-8_15 |title=Advanced Peripheral Nerve Surgery and Minimal Invasive Spinal Surgery |year=2005 |last1=Crotti |first1=Francesco Maria |last2=Carai |first2=A. |last3=Carai |first3=M. |last4=Sgaramella |first4=E. |last5=Sias |first5=W. |volume=97 |chapter=Entrapment of crural branches of the common peroneal nerve |series=Acta Neurochirurgica |isbn=3-211-23368-7}}</ref>

Withdrawal from opiates can cause WED/RLS at night{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} ranging in discomfort between a feeling of numbness in the muscle and/or bones to feelings of pain and burning, similar to that which can be noticed after exercise due to buildup of [[lactic acid]] in the muscles.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Some{{who|date=June 2012}} believe the movement and/or pain may itself cause a minor release of endorphins, helping one rest—albeit for short periods—by reducing adrenaline levels and inducing natural post exercise sedation.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The cause vs. effect of certain conditions and behaviors observed in some patients (ex. excess weight, lack of exercise, depression or other mental illnesses) is not well established. Loss of sleep due to WED/RLS could cause the conditions, or medication used to treat a condition could cause WED/RLS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/545408_2|title=Exercise and Restless Legs Syndrome|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first1=Barbara A. |last1=Phillips |first2=Pat |last2=Britz |first3=Wayne |last3=Hening |date=October 31, 2005 |title=The NSF 2005 Sleep in American poll and those at risk for RLS |conference=Chest 2005 |url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1213710 |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/10/051031132243.htm |laydate=October 31, 2005 |laysource=ScienceDaily}}</ref>

===Genetics===
More than 60% of cases of WED/RLS are familial<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7701186 |year=1994 |last1=Lavigne |first1=GJ |last2=Montplaisir |first2=JY |title=Restless legs syndrome and sleep bruxism: prevalence and association among Canadians |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=739–43 |journal=Sleep}}</ref> and are inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion with [[variable penetrance]].

No one knows the exact cause of WED/RLS.  Research and brain autopsies have implicated both dopaminergic system and iron insufficiency in the [[substantia nigra]] (study published in ''Neurology'', 2003).<ref>{{cite journal |pages=304–9 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000078887.16593.12 |title=Neuropathological examination suggests impaired brain iron acquisition in restless legs syndrome |year=2003 |last1=Connor |first1=J.R. |last2=Boyer |first2=P.J. |last3=Menzies |first3=S.L. |last4=Dellinger |first4=B. |last5=Allen |first5=R.P. |last6=Ondo |first6=W.G. |last7=Earley |first7=C.J. |journal=Neurology |volume=61 |issue=3 |pmid=12913188}}</ref> Iron is an essential cofactor for the formation of L-dopa, the precursor of dopamine.

Six genetic loci found by [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] are known and listed below. Other than the first one, the remainder of the linkage loci were discovered using an autosomal dominant model of inheritance.

Three genes, [[MEIS1]], [[BTBD9]] and [[MAP2K5]], were found to be associated to WED/RLS.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1000–6 |doi=10.1038/ng2099 |title=Genome-wide association study of restless legs syndrome identifies common variants in three genomic regions |year=2007 |last1=Winkelmann |first1=Juliane |last2=Schormair |first2=Barbara |last3=Lichtner |first3=Peter |last4=Ripke |first4=Stephan |last5=Xiong |first5=Lan |last6=Jalilzadeh |first6=Shapour |last7=Fulda |first7=Stephany |last8=Pütz |first8=Benno |last9=Eckstein |first9=Gertrud |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=39 |issue=8 |pmid=17637780}}</ref>
Their role in RLS [[pathogenesis]] is still unclear.

There is also some evidence that [[periodic limb movements in sleep]] (PLMS) are associated with {{Gene|BTBD9}} on chromosome 6p21.2.<ref name="pmid17634447">{{cite journal |pages=639–47 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa072743 |title=A Genetic Risk Factor for Periodic Limb Movements in Sleep |year=2007 |last1=Stefansson |first1=Hreinn |last2=Rye |first2=David B. |last3=Hicks |first3=Andrew |last4=Petursson |first4=Hjorvar |last5=Ingason |first5=Andres |last6=Thorgeirsson |first6=Thorgeir E. |last7=Palsson |first7=Stefan |last8=Sigmundsson |first8=Thordur |last9=Sigurdsson |first9=Albert P. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=7 |pmid=17634447}}</ref>  The presence of a positive family history suggests that there may be a genetic involvement in the etiology of RLS.

==Diagnosis==
There are no specific tests for WED/RLS, but non-specific laboratory tests are used to rule out other causes such as vitamin deficiencies. According to the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]], four symptoms are used to confirm the diagnosis:<ref>{{cite web|title=Restless Legs Syndrome Factsheet|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/detail_restless_legs.htm|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

*The symptoms are more severe at night and do not occur, or are negligible, in the morning (although in extreme cases, symptoms may occur in the daytime)
*An irresistible urge to move the legs and/or arms, often associated with a sensation of pain, burning, pricking, tingling, numbness, or other unpleasant or unusual sensations
*The sensations begin following relaxation or a period of staying still, and during sleep
*Temporary relief from these sensations during movement of the affected legs and/or arms

==Prevention ==
Other than preventing the underlying causes, generally no method of preventing WED/RLS has been established or studied. If WED/RLS is due to specific treatable causes (specific medications or treatable conditions), then treatment of those causes may also remove or reduce RLS. Otherwise medical responses focus on treating the condition, either [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatically]] or by targeting lifestyle changes and bodily processes capable of modifying its expression or severity.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Treatment==
Treatment of Willis-Ekbom Disease/restless legs syndrome involves identifying the cause of symptoms when possible.  The treatment process is designed to reduce symptoms, including decreasing the number of nights with WED/RLS symptoms, the severity of RLS symptoms and nighttime awakenings.  Improving the quality of life is another goal in treatment.  This means improving overall quality of life, decreasing daytime somnolence, and improving the quality of sleep. Pharmacologic treatment involves [[dopamine agonists]] or [[gabapentin enacarbil]] as first line drugs for daily restless legs syndrome, and [[opioids]] for treatment of resistant cases.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=294–301 |doi=10.1097/NRL.0b013e3181422589 |title=Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movements During Sleep: Diagnosis and Treatment |year=2007 |last1=Karatas |first1=Mehmet |journal=The Neurologist |volume=13 |issue=5 |pmid=17848868}}</ref> 

An algorithm created by [[Mayo Clinic]] researchers and endorsed by the Willis-Eckbom Disease Foundation<ref>Willis-Ekbom Foundation: Winter 2013; New Name, Same Mission, Introducing the Willis-Ekboom Disease Foundation</ref> provides guidance to the treating physician and patient, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.<ref name="MayoAlgo">{{cite journal |pages=916–22 |doi=10.4065/79.7.916 |title=An Algorithm for the Management of Restless Legs Syndrome |year=2004 |last1=Silber |first1=Michael H. |last2=Ehrenberg |first2=Bruce L. |last3=Allen |first3=Richard P. |last4=Buchfuhrer |first4=Mark J. |last5=Earley |first5=Christopher J. |last6=Hening |first6=Wayne A. |last7=Rye |first7=David B. |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=79 |issue=7 |pmid=15244390 |author8=Medical Advisory Board of the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation}}</ref> Treatment of primary RLS should not be considered until possible precipitating medical conditions are ruled out, especially venous disorders. RLS drug therapy is not curative and has side effects such as [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], [[hallucinations]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], or daytime sleep attacks.

Secondary WED/RLS may be cured if precipitating medical conditions (anemia, venous disorder) are managed effectively. Secondary conditions causing WED/RLS include [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]], [[varicose veins]], and [[thyroid]] problems. Karl-Axel Ekbom, in his 1945 doctoral thesis on RLS, suspected venous disease in about 12.5% of cases. But due to the unavailability of Doppler ultrasound imaging technology (the diagnostic tool that detects abnormal blood flow in the veins - "[[venous reflux]]" - the pathological basis for [[varicose veins]]) at that time, Ekbom may have underestimated the role of venous disease. In uncontrolled prospective series, improvement of RLS was achieved in a high percentage of patients presenting with a combination of RLS and venous disease and had sclerotherapy or other treatment for the correction of venous insufficiency.<ref name="pmid18467618">{{cite journal |pages=112–7 |doi=10.1258/phleb.2007.007051 |title=The effect of endovenous laser ablation on restless legs syndrome |year=2008 |last1=Hayes |first1=C A |last2=Kingsley |first2=J R |last3=Hamby |first3=K R |last4=Carlow |first4=J |journal=Phlebology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pmid=18467618}}</ref><ref name="pmid7728485">{{cite journal |pages=328–32 |doi=10.1016/1076-0512(94)00094-7 |year=1995 |last1=Kanter |journal=Dermatologic Surgery |volume=21 |pmid=7728485 |first1=AH |title=The effect of sclerotherapy on restless legs syndrome |issue=4}}</ref>  

Nonpharmacologic treatments may also reduce the symptoms or their severity. For example, since fatigue may worsen the symptoms, then relaxation techniques, soaking in a warm bath, or massaging the legs can all help aid in relaxation and relief of WED/RLS symptoms.  Some other techniques are avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco; exercising every day; maintaining a schedule of relaxation; and avoiding heavy meals before bed.  These techniques can be used with medication or by themselves for those who do not want medication.  For symptoms that occur in the evening, patients may find that activities that alert the mind, such as crossword puzzles and video games, may reduce symptoms.  Many patients may also benefit from WED/RLS support groups.<ref>Willis-Ekbom Disease Foundation; Winter 2013; WED/RLS Support Group Network</ref>

===Stretching, shaking legs and other methods of relief===
Stretching the leg muscles can bring temporary relief.<ref name=pmid14592341/><ref name=pmid11435804>{{cite journal |pages=128–47 |doi=10.1097/00004691-200103000-00004 |title=Restless Legs Syndrome |year=2001 |last1=Allen |first1=Richard P. |last2=Earley |first2=Christopher J. |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=11435804}}</ref>
Walking and moving the legs, as the name "Restless Legs" implies, brings temporary relief. In fact, those suffering from WED/RLS often have an almost uncontrollable need to walk and therefore relieve the symptoms while they are moving.  Unfortunately the symptoms usually return immediately after the moving and walking ceases. Hot <ref> http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/09/restless-legs-syndrome-isnt-trivial </ref> or cold showers or baths have also been known to improve symptoms<ref> http://www.drtatman.com/restless-legs.asp </ref> as has lying on one's front on the floor for approximately half an hour.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2011.01.001 |title=Sexual intercourse and masturbation: Potential relief factors for restless legs syndrome? |year=2011 |last1=Marin |first1=Luis F. |last2=Felicio |first2=André C. |last3=Prado |first3=Gilmar F. |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=422 |pmid=21377419}}</ref>

Monochromatic near-infrared light treatment has also been shown to decrease symptoms associated with WED/RLS. A study showed there was a steady decrease in symptoms over the four weeks in the treatment group, and after four weeks of treatment, the treatment group had a significantly greater improvement in RLS symptoms than the control group.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=345–51 |doi=10.3109/09593985.2010.511440 |title=Restless legs syndrome and near-infrared light: An alternative treatment option |year=2011 |last1=Mitchell |first1=Ulrike H |last2=Myrer |first2=J William |last3=Johnson |first3=A Wayne |last4=Hilton |first4=Sterling C |journal=Physiotherapy Theory and Practice |volume=27 |issue=5 |pmid=20977377}}</ref>

===Iron supplements===
According to some guidelines,<ref name="MayoAlgo"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2377-11-28 |title=Algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of Willis-Ekbom Diseae/restless legs syndrome in primary care |year=2011 |last1=Garcia-Borreguero |first1=Diego |last2=Stillman |first2=Paul |last3=Benes |first3=Heike |last4=Buschmann |first4=Heiner |last5=Chaudhuri |first5=K Ray |last6=Gonzalez Rodríguez |first6=Victor M |last7=Högl |first7=Birgit |last8=Kohnen |first8=Ralf |last9=Monti |first9=Giorgio |journal=BMC Neurology |volume=11 |pages=28 |pmid=21352569 |pmc=3056753}}</ref> all people with WED/RLS should have their serum [[ferritin]] level tested. The ferritin level, a measure of the body's iron stores, should be at least 50&nbsp;µg/L (or ng/mL, an equivalent unit) for those with WED/RLS. Oral iron supplements, taken under a doctor's care, can increase ferritin levels. For some people, increasing ferritin will eliminate or reduce RLS symptoms; a ferritin level of 50&nbsp;µg/L is not sufficient for some sufferers and increasing the level to 80&nbsp;µg/L may further reduce symptoms.  However, at least 40% of people will not notice any improvement.  Treatment with IV iron is being tested at the US [[Mayo Clinic]] and [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]].  It is dangerous to take iron supplements without first having ferritin levels tested, as many people with WED/RLS do not have low ferritin and taking iron when it is not called for can cause [[iron overload disorder]], a potentially dangerous condition.<ref name="pmid17516455">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mds.21545 |title=State of the art in restless legs syndrome therapy: Practice recommendations for treating restless legs syndrome |year=2007 |last1=Oertel |first1=Wolfgang H. |last2=Trenkwalder |first2=Claudia |last3=Zucconi |first3=Marco |last4=Benes |first4=Heike |last5=Borreguero |first5=Diego Garcia |last6=Bassetti |first6=Claudio |last7=Partinen |first7=Markku |last8=Ferini-Strambi |first8=Luigi |last9=Stiasny-Kolster |first9=Karin |journal=Movement Disorders |volume=22 |pages=S466–S475 |pmid=17516455}}</ref>

===Pharmaceuticals===
For those whose WED/RLS disrupts or prevents sleep or regular daily activities, medication may be required. Many doctors currently use, and the [[Mayo Clinic]] [[algorithm]] includes,<ref name="MayoAlgo" /> medication from four categories: {{citation needed|reason=five categories are listed below|date=November 2011}}

#[[Dopamine agonist]]s such as [[ropinirole]], [[pramipexole]], [[carbidopa]]/[[levodopa]] or [[pergolide]].  [[Ropinirole]] (Requip) was first approved In 2005 by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to treat moderate to severe Willis-Ekbom Disease/Restless Legs Syndrome. The drug was first approved for [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1997.  [[Pramipexole]] (Mirapex, Sifrol, Mirapexen in the EU) received a positive recommendation by the EU Scientific Committee in February 2006. The FDA approved Mirapex for sale in the US in 2006. [[Rotigotine]] (Neupro), which is delivered by a [[transdermal patch]] was approved by the FDA in May 2007 for early stage Parkinson's disease, but at that time had not yet been approved for WED/RLS in the US. The Neupro patch was withdrawn from the US market shortly after initial introduction due to problems with the medication delivery system.  [[Rotigotine]] (Neupro), was approved for sale in the EU in 2007 for not only advanced stage Parkinson's disease but also for WED/RLS.   [[Rotigotine]] (Neupro) patches was reintroduced to the U.S. market in mid-2012 after modifications, extensive trials, and subsequent FDA approval, at doses up to 3 mg/day for RLS and up to higher dosesfor Parkinson's.

There are, however, issues with the use of dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists have caused augmentation. This is a medical condition where the drug itself causes symptoms to increase in severity and/or occur earlier in the day. Dopamine agonists may also cause rebound, when symptoms increase as the drug wears off. In many cases, the longer dopamine agonists are used the higher the risk of augmentation and rebound as well as the severity of the symptoms. Also, a recent study indicated that dopamine agonists used in Willis-Ekbom Disease/restless leg syndrome patients can lead to an increase in [[compulsive gambling]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000252368.25106.b6 |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070208222800.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=February 9, 2007 |title=Pathologic gambling in patients with restless legs syndrome treated with dopaminergic agonists |year=2007 |last1=Tippmann-Peikert |first1=M. |last2=Park |first2=J.

Recently, several major pharmaceutical companies are reported to be marketing drugs without an explicit approval for WED/RLS, which are "[[off-label]]" applications for drugs approved for other diseases.   The Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation<ref>* [http://www.rls.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?&pid=471&srcid=-2 RLS Foundation]</ref> received 44% of its $1.4 million in funding from these pharmaceutical groups.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(06)60831-2 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225755.100-patient-groups-special-swallowing-the-best-advice.html |title=Swallowing the best advice? |year=2006 |last1=Marshall |first1=Jessica |last2=Aldhous |first2=Peter |journal=New Scientist |volume=192 |issue=2575 |pages=18}}</ref>

[[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] may help people who experience WED/RLS sensations fall asleep much faster than normal, eliminate nausea caused from medication, and relieve pain. Although still restricted by the Federal Government, many states do consider WED/RLS a medical condition for Medical Marijuana.&nbsp; (A pill form called [[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] eliminates the primary health hazards associated with marijuana use, such as smoking.){{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Quinine]] is frequently used [[off label]] to treat WED/RLS but is not recommended by the FDA due to its risk of serious [[hematological]] side effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm218424.htm |title=Qualaquin (quinine sulfate): New Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy – Risk of serious hematological reactions |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

A [[meta-analysis]] published November 2007 combined previous 6–12 week long placebo-controlled studies done for [[ropinirole]],  which was the first medication to receive FDA-approved labeling for use in WED/RLS, and [[pramipexole]] to indirectly compare adverse reactions and efficacy. It found that while both drugs had the same efficacy, pramipexole had significantly lower incidences of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.

Moreover, these medications were found to be safe and without major side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2011.11.010 |title=Efficacy of vitamins C, E, and their combination for treatment of restless legs syndrome in hemodialysis patients: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial |year=2012 |last1=Sagheb |first1=Mohammad Mahdi |last2=Dormanesh |first2=Banafshe |last3=Fallahzadeh |first3=Mohammad Kazem |last4=Akbari |first4=Hamideh |last5=Sohrabi Nazari |first5=Sahar |last6=Heydari |first6=Seyed Taghi |last7=Behzadi |first7=Saeed |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=542–5 |pmid=22317944}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
WED/RLS symptoms may gradually worsen with age, though more slowly for those with the idiopathic form of WED/RLS than for patients who also suffer from an associated medical condition. Nevertheless, current therapies can control the disorder, minimizing symptoms and increasing periods of restful sleep. In addition, some patients have remissions, periods in which symptoms decrease or disappear for days, weeks, or months, although symptoms usually eventually reappear. Being diagnosed with RLS does not indicate or foreshadow another neurological disease.

==Epidemiology==
Claims about the prevalence of Willis-Ekbom Disease/restless legs syndrome can be confusing because its severity and frequency varies enormously between individual sufferers. WED/RLS affects an estimated 7% to 10% of the general population in North America and Europe.<ref name="ChestReview2006">{{cite journal |pages=1596–604 |doi=10.1378/chest.130.5.1596 |title=Restless Legs Syndrome: A Clinical Update |year=2006 |last1=Gamaldo |first1=C.

==History==
The first known medical description of WED/RLS was by [[Thomas Willis|Sir Thomas Willis]] in 1672.<ref name=pmid15165536
>{{cite journal |pages=279–83 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2004.01.002 |title=Restless legs syndrome: an historical note |year=2004 |last1=Coccagna |first1=G |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=5 |issue=3 |pmid=15165536 |last2=Vetrugno |first2=R |last3=Lombardi |first3=C |last4=Provini |first4=F}}</ref> Willis (1621–1675) is considered to be the founder of clinical neuroscience and is most famous for his description of the [[Circle of Willis]], the arterial circle at the base of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=329–35 |doi=10.1038/nrn1369 |title=Timeline: Thomas Willis (1621–1675), the founder of clinical neuroscience |year=2004 |last1=Molnár |first1=Zoltán |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=4 |pmid=15034557}}</ref> His contributions to the understanding of the human brain and medical science were extensive and revolutionary at the time.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=765–75 |doi=10.3171/JNS/2008/109/10/0765 |title=The legendary contributions of Thomas Willis (1621–1675): The arterial circle and beyond |year=2008 |last1=Rengachary |first1=Setti S. |last2=Xavier |first2=Andrew |last3=Manjila |first3=Sunil |last4=Smerdon |first4=Usha |last5=Parker |first5=Brandon |last6=Hadwan |first6=Suzan |last7=Guthikonda |first7=Murali |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=109 |issue=4 |pmid=18826368}}</ref>   Known to be a keen observer of his patients' symptoms, Willis emphasized the sleep disruption and limb movements experienced by sufferers of RLS.  Initially published in Latin (''De Anima Brutorum'', 1672) but later translated to English (''The London Practice of Physick'', 1685), Willis wrote:

{{cquote|''Wherefore to some, when being abed they betake themselves to sleep, presently in the arms and legs, leapings and contractions on the tendons, and so great a restlessness and tossings of other members ensue, that the diseased are no more able to sleep, than if they were in a place of the greatest torture.''}}

Subsequently, other descriptions of WED/RLS were published, including those by Francois Boissier de Sauvages (1763), Magnus Huss (1849), Theodur Wittmaack (1861), [[George Miller Beard]] (1880), [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]] (1898), [[Hermann Oppenheim]] (1923) and Frederick Gerard Allison (1943).<ref name=pmid15165536/><ref>{{cite journal |pages=586–91 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2008.04.008 |title=Two early descriptions of restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements by Boissier de Sauvages (1763) and Gilles de la Tourette (1898) |year=2009 |last1=Konofal |first1=Eric |last2=Karroum |first2=Elias |last3=Montplaisir |first3=Jacques |last4=Derenne |first4=Jean-Philippe |last5=Arnulf |first5=Isabelle |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=10 |issue=5 |pmid=18752999}}</ref> However, it was not until almost three centuries after Willis, in 1945, that Karl-Axel Ekbom (1907–1977) provided a detailed and comprehensive report of this condition in his doctoral thesis, ''Restless legs: clinical study of hitherto overlooked disease''.<ref>{{Cite journal |pages=1–123 |doi=10.1111/j.0954-6820.1945.tb11970.x |title=PREFACE |year=2009 |last1=Ekrbom |first1=Karl-Axel |journal=Acta Medica Scandinavica |volume=121}}</ref> Ekbom coined the term "restless legs" and continued work on this disorder throughout his career. He described the essential diagnostic symptoms, differential diagnosis from other conditions, prevalence, relation to anemia, and common occurrence during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=254–7 |doi=10.1016/j.parkreldis.2008.07.011 |title=Professor Karl-Axel Ekbom and restless legs syndrome |year=2009 |last1=Teive |first1=Hélio A.G. |last2=Munhoz |first2=Renato P. |last3=Barbosa |first3=Egberto Reis |journal=Parkinsonism & Related Disorders |volume=15 |issue=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=223–4 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2004.04.002 |title=The legacy of Karl-Axel Ekbom |year=2004 |last1=Ulfberg |first1=J |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=5 |issue=3 |pmid=15165526}}</ref> 

Ekbom's work was largely ignored until it was rediscovered by Arthur S. Walters and Wayne A. Hening in the 1980s. Subsequent landmark publications include 1995 and 2003 papers, which revised and updated the diagnostic criteria.<ref name="pmid14592341"/><ref>{{cite journal |pages=634–42 |doi=10.1002/mds.870100517 |title=Toward a better definition of the restless legs syndrome |year=1995 |last1=Walters |first1=Arthur S. |last2=Aldrich |first2=Michael S. |last3=Allen |first3=Richard |last4=Ancoli-Israel |first4=Sonia |last5=Buchholz |first5=David |last6=Chokroverty |first6=Sudhansu |last7=Coccagna |first7=Giorgio |last8=Earley |first8=Christopher |last9=Ehrenberg |first9=Bruce |journal=Movement Disorders |volume=10 |issue=5 |pmid=8552117}}</ref> Journal of Parkinsonism and RLS is the first peer reviewed, online, open access journal dedicated to publishing research about Parkinson's disease and was founded by a Canadian neurologist Dr. Abdul Qayyum Rana.

==Controversy==
As with many diseases with diffuse symptoms, there is controversy among physicians as to whether WED/RLS is a distinct syndrome. The U.S. [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] publishes an information sheet<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/detail_restless_legs.htm Restless Legs Syndrome Fact Sheet]</ref> characterizing the syndrome but acknowledging it as a difficult diagnosis. Some physicians consider it a real entity that has specific diagnostic criteria.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=324–9 |doi=10.1002/mds.870130220 |title=Immobilization tests and periodic leg movements in sleep for the diagnosis of restless leg syndrome |year=1998 |last1=Montplaisir |first1=Jacques |last2=Boucher |first2=Sylvie |last3=Nicolas |first3=Alain |last4=Lesperance |first4=Paul |last5=Gosselin |first5=Anik |last6=Rompré |first6=Pierre |last7=Lavigne |first7=Gilles |journal=Movement Disorders |volume=13 |issue=2 |pmid=9539348}}</ref>

Many doctors express the view that the incidence of Willis-Ekbom Disease/restless leg syndrome is exaggerated by manufacturers of drugs used to treat it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030170 |title=Giving Legs to Restless Legs: A Case Study of How the Media Helps Make People Sick |year=2006 |last1=Woloshin |first1=Steven |last2=Schwartz |first2=Lisa M. |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=e170 |pmid=16597175 |pmc=1434499}}</ref> Others believe it is an underrecognized and undertreated disorder.<ref name="ChestReview2006"/> Some of the controversy results from the fact that certain pharmaceutical companies used medical representatives (''i.e.'', salespeople) to perform investigations into the treatment of WED/RLS even though those companies had no licensed treatments for the condition. Further, [[GlaxoSmithKline]] ran advertisements that, while not promoting off-license use of their drug ([[ropinirole]]) for treatment of WED/RLS, did link to the [http://www.rlsuk-esa.org.uk/ Ekbom Support Group] website. That website contained statements advocating the use of ropinirole to treat WED/RLS. The [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|ABPI]] ruled against GSK in this case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article601394.ece|title=Glaxo's cure for 'restless legs' was an unlicensed drug|last=Templeton|first=Sarah-Kate |date=August 6, 2006|work=Times Online|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd.|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref>

Another point of confusion is that Willis-Ekbom Disease/RLS and [[delusional parasitosis]] are entirely different conditions that share part of the Wittmaack-Ekbom syndrome [[List of eponymous diseases|eponym]], as both syndromes were described by the same person, Karl-Axel Ekbom.<ref name="WhoNamedIt">{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2337|Wittmaack-Ekbom syndrome}}</ref>
