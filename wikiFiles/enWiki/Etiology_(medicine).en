'''Etiology''' (alternatively '''aetiology''', '''aitiology''') ({{IPAc-en|icon|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}) is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. 

The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiologia'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitia'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'').<ref>{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd ed. | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}</ref>

==Description==
In medicine, the term refers to the causes of [[disease]]s or [[pathology|pathologies]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Greene J | url = http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-364.html | title = The three C's of etiology | work = Wide Smiles | year = 1996 | accessdate = 2007-08-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070630061038/http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-364.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-30}} Discusses several examples of the medical usage of the term ''etiology'' in the context of [[cleft lip]]s and explains methods used to study causation.</ref> Where no etiology can be ascertained, the disorder is said to be [[idiopathic]].
Traditional accounts of the causes of disease may point to the "[[evil eye]]".<ref>

Medieval thinking on the etiology of disease showed the influence of [[Galen]] and of [[Hippocrates]].<ref>[http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/83/979/352 Maimonides: an early but accurate view on the treatment of hemorrhoids -- Magrill and Sekaran 83 (979): 352 -- Postgraduate Medical Journal]</ref> Medieval [[Europe]]an doctors generally held the view that disease was related to the air and adopted a [[Miasma theory of disease|miasmatic approach]] to disease etiology.<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/index/w44720475g378602.pdf Case study: the history and ethics clean air]</ref>

Etiological discovery in medicine has a history in [[Robert Koch]]'s demonstration that the tubercle bacillus (''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' complex) causes the disease [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' causes [[anthrax]], and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' causes [[cholera]].  This line of thinking and evidence is summarized in [[Koch's postulates]]. But proof of causation in infectious diseases is limited to individual cases that provide experimental evidence of etiology.

In [[epidemiology]], several lines of evidence together are required to infer causation. [[Austin Bradford Hill|Sir Austin Bradford-Hill]] demonstrated a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, and summarized the line of reasoning in the epidemiological criteria for causation. Dr. Al Evans, a US epidemiologist, synthesized his predecessors' ideas in proposing the Unified Concept of Causation.

Further thinking in epidemiology was required to distinguish [[correlation is not causation|causation from association or statistical correlation]]. Events may occur together simply due to [[Randomness|chance]], [[bias]] or [[confounding]], instead of one event being caused by the other. It is also important to know which event is the cause. Careful sampling and measurement are more important than sophisticated statistical analysis to determine causation. Experimental evidence involving interventions (providing or removing the supposed cause) gives the most compelling evidence of etiology.

Etiology is sometimes a part of a chain of causation. An etiological agent of disease may require an independent co-factor, and be subject to a promoter (increases expression) to cause disease. An example of all the above, which was recognized late, is that [[peptic ulcer disease]] may be induced by stress, requires the presence of acid secretion in the stomach, and has primary etiology in ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection. Many chronic diseases of unknown cause may be studied in this framework to explain multiple epidemiological associations or risk factors which may or may not be causally related, and to seek the actual etiology.

Some diseases, such as [[diabetes]] or [[hepatitis]], are syndromically defined by their signs and [[symptom]]s, but include different conditions with different etiologies. Conversely, a single etiology, such as [[Epstein-Barr virus]], may in different circumstances produce different diseases such as [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], or [[Burkitt's lymphoma]].
