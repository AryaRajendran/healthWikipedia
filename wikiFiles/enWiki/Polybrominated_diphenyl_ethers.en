'''Polybrominated diphenyl ethers''' or '''PBDEs''', are [[organobromine compound]]s that are used as [[flame retardant]].   Like other [[brominated flame retardant]]s, PBDEs have been used in a wide array of products, including building materials, electronics, furnishings, motor vehicles, airplanes, plastics, [[polyurethane]] foams,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3113369/] "Identification of Flame Retardants in Polyurethane Foam Collected From Baby Products"</ref> and textiles.  They are structurally akin to the [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s and other [[polyhalogenated compound]]s, consisting of two [[halogen]]ated aromatic rings. PBDEs are classified according to the average number of [[bromine]] atoms in the molecule.  The health hazards of these chemicals have attracted increasing scrutiny, and they have been shown to reduce fertility in humans at levels found in households.<ref>{{cite pmid|20103495}}</ref>  Their chlorine analogs are [[polychlorinated diphenyl ethers]] (PCDEs). Because of their toxicity and persistence, the industrial production of some PBDEs is restricted  under the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants|Stockholm Convention]], a treaty to control and phase out major [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs).

==Classes of PBDEs==
[[File:Polybrominated diphenyl ether.svg|thumb|right|Chemical structure of PBDEs]]
The family of PBDEs consists of 209 possible substances, which are called [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] (PBDE = C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>(10−x)</sub>Br<sub>x</sub>O (x = 1, 2, ..., 10 = m + n)).  The number of isomers for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, [[pentabromodiphenyl ether|penta-]], hexa-, hepta-, [[octabromodiphenyl ether|octa-]], nona-, and [[decabromodiphenyl ether]]s are 3, 12, 24, 42, 46, 42, 24, 12, 3 and 1, respectively.<ref name="STE">{{cite news | publisher = Science of the Total Environment, vol. 275 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896970100852X | author = Frank Rahman ''et al.'' | title = Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants |pages=1–17 | year = 2001}}</ref> In the United States, PBDEs are marketed with trade names: DE-60F, DE-61, DE-62, and DE-71 applied to pentaBDE mixtures; DE-79 applied to octaBDE mixtures; DE 83R and Saytex 102E applied to decaBDE mixtures. The available commercial PBDE products are not single compounds or even single congeners but rather a mixture of congeners.

===Lower brominated PBDEs===
These species average 1-5 [[bromine]] atoms per molecule and are regarded as more dangerous because they more efficiently [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]]. Lower-brominated PBDEs have been known to affect [[hormone]] levels in the [[thyroid]] gland. Studies have linked them to reproductive and neurological risks at certain concentrations or higher.<ref name="EST1">{{cite news | publisher = [[Environmental Science & Technology]] | url = http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/esthag-w/2001/dec/science/kb_pbde.html | author = Kellyn S. Betts | title = Rapidly rising PBDE levels in North America | date = 2001-12-07}}{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

===Higher brominated PBDEs===
These species average more than 5 [[bromine]] atoms per molecule.  

The commercial mixture, named pentabromodiphenyl ether, contains  the pentabromo derivative predominantly (50-62%), however the mixture also contains tetrabromides (24-38%) and hexabromides (4-8%), as well as traces of the tribromides (0-1%). In similar manner, commercial octabromodiphenyl ether is a mixture of homologs: hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and decabromides.

==Health and environmental concerns==
Since the 1990s, the environmental concern raised because of high lipophilicity and high resistance of PBDEs to degradation processes. While biodegradation is not considered the main pathway for PBDEs, the [[Photodissociation|photolysis]] and [[pyrolysis]] can be of interest in studies of transformation of PBDEs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hutzinger O, ''et al.'' |title=Polybrominated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans |journal=[[Chemosphere]] |volume=16 |pages= 1877–1880 |year=1987 |doi=10.1016/0045-6535(87)90181-0 |last2=Thoma |first2=H. |issue=8–9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Watanabe I, ''et al.'' |title=Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in marine fish, shellfish and river sediments in Japan |journal=[[Chemosphere]] |volume=16 |pages= 2389–2396 |year=1987 |doi=10.1016/0045-6535(87)90297-9 |last2=Kashimoto |first2=Takashi |last3=Tatsukawa |first3=Ryo |issue=10–12 }}</ref> People are exposed to low levels of PBDEs through ingestion of food and by inhalation. PBDEs bioaccumulate in blood, breast milk, and fat tissues. Personnel associated with the manufacture of PBDE-containing products are exposed to highest levels of PBDEs. Bioaccumulation is of particular concern in such instances, especially for personnel in recycling and repair plants of PBDE-containing products. People are also exposed to these chemicals in their domestic environment because of their prevalence in common household items. Studies in [[Canada]] have found significant concentrations of PBDEs in common foods such as [[salmon]], [[ground beef]], [[butter]], and [[cheese]].<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050214.wchemicals14/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth Globe and Mail article] "Common foods laced with chemical"</ref> PBDEs have also been found at high levels in indoor dust, sewage sludge, and effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Increasing PBDE levels have been detected in the blood of [[marine mammal]]s such as [[harbor seal]]s.

There is also growing concern that PBDEs share the environmental long life and [[bioaccumulation]] properties of [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]].<ref>[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2000/108p387-392hooper/hooper-full.html The PBDEs: An Emerging Environmental Challenge and Another Reason for Breast-Milk Monitoring Programs]</ref>

===Case studies===
Studies show that children in the United States, Norway, Australia, and the Faroe Islands have higher levels of PBDEs than adults.<ref>[http://ewg.org/reports/pbdesintoddlers] "Toxic Compounds in Toddlers & Preschoolers 3x Higher Than in Moms"</ref> In the United States, children's blood concentrations average 62 parts per billion (ppb) and range from 24 to 114 ppb. Published studies express concern because exposure to PBDEs impairs development of the nervous system. PBDEs have also been shown to have hormone-disrupting effects, in particular, on [[estrogen]] and [[thyroid hormone]]s. A 2009 animal study conducted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) demonstrates that deiodination, active transport, sulfation, and glucuronidation may be involved in disruption of [[thyroid homeostasis]] after [[perinatal]] exposure to PBDEs during critical developmental time points in utero and shortly after birth.<ref>Szabo DT, Richardson VM, Ross DG, Diliberto JJ, Kodavanti PR, Birnbaum LS (January 2009). "Effects of perinatal PBDE exposure on hepatic phase I, phase II, phase III, and deiodinase 1 gene expression involved in thyroid hormone metabolism in male rat pups". Toxicol. Sci. 107 (1): 27–39. {{doi|10.1093/toxsci/kfn230}}. PMID 18978342.</ref> The adverse effects on hepatic mechanism of thyroid hormone disruption during development have been shown to persist into adulthood. The EPA noted that PBDEs are particularly toxic to the developing brains of animals. Peer-reviewed studies have shown that even a single dose administered to mice during development of the brain can cause permanent changes in behavior, including hyperactivity.<ref>"Developmental exposure to low-dose PBDE-99: effects on male fertility and neurobehavior in rat offspring" Environmental Health Perspectives 2005 volume 113, pp. 149–154. {{DOI|10.1289/ehp.7421}}</ref>

The most-common PBDEs that are used in electronics are in a form known as Deca. Deca is banned in Europe for this use and in some U.S. states. For PBDE, EPA has set reference dose of 7 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, which is "believed to be without appreciable effects". However, Linda Birnbaum, PhD, a senior toxicologist with the EPA notes concern: "What I see is another piece of evidence that supports the fact that levels of these chemicals in children appear to be higher than the levels in their parents; I think this study raises a red flag.<ref>[http://children.webmd.com/news/20080904/fire-retardant-toxins-in-your-kids-blood WebMD article] "Fire Retardants Found in Children's Blood"</ref> Previous study by EWG in 2003 published test results showing that the average level of fire-retardants in breast milk from 20 American mothers was 75 times higher than the average levels measured in Europe.<ref>[http://foodconsumer.org/7777/8888/Agri_amp_Environ_41/090408182008_Toxic_Compounds_in_Toddlers_Preschoolers_3x_Higher_Than_in_Moms.shtml Food Consumer article] "Toxic Compounds in Toddlers & Preschoolers 3x Higher Than in Moms"</ref> 

It has been postulated that increasing levels of PBDEs in the environment could be correlated with the increasing incidence of feline hyperthyroidism.  However, a study in 2007 found that no association could be detected between hyperthyroid cats and serum PBDE levels.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/es0708159 | title = Elevated PBDE Levels in Pet Cats: Sentinels for Humans? | year = 2007 | author = Dye, J.A. | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 41 | pages = 6350 | last2 = Venier | first2 = Marta | last3 = Zhu | first3 = Lingyan | last4 = Ward | first4 = Cynthia R. | last5 = Hites | first5 = Ronald A. | last6 = Birnbaum | first6 = Linda S. | issue = 18}}</ref>

An experiment conducted at [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in 2005 showed that the [[isotopic signature]] of methoxy-PBDEs found in [[whale]] [[blubber]] contained [[carbon-14]], the naturally occurring radioactive [[isotope]] of carbon. Methoxy-PBDEs are produced by some marine species.<ref>{{cite journal | author = A. Malmvärn, Y. Zebühr, L. Kautsky, Å. Bergman, L.

The carbon-14 may instead be in methoxy groups enzymatically added to man-made PBDEs.

A 2010 study found that children with higher concentrations of PBDEs in their umbilical cord blood at birth scored lower on tests of mental and physical development between the ages of one and six. Developmental effects were particularly evident at four years of age, when verbal and full IQ scores were reduced 5.5 to 8.0 points for those with the highest prenatal exposures.<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100119121434.htm</ref>

==Regulations of PBDEs==
As of June 1, 2006 the State of California began prohibiting the manufacture, distribution, and processing of flame-retardant products containing pentabrominated diphenyl ether (pentaBDE) and octabrominated diphenyl (octaBDE). PBDEs are ubiquitous in the environment, and, according to the EPA, exposure may pose health risks. According to U.S. EPA's Integrated Risk Information System, evidence indicates that PBDEs may possess liver toxicity, thyroid toxicity, and neurodevelopmental toxicity.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0035tr.pdf] US Environmental Protection Agency. Toxicological Profile for Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) Integrated Risk Information System, June 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/IRIS/toxreviews/1008tr.pdf] US Environmental Protection Agency.

The European Union decided to ban the use of two classes of flame retardants, in particular, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in electric and electronic devices. This ban was formalised in the [[ROHS|RoHS]] Directive, and an upper limit of 1 g/kg for the sum of PBBs and PBDEs was set. In February 2009, the [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements|Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM)]] released two certified reference materials (CRMs) to help analytical laboratories better detect these two classes of flame retardants. The reference materials were custom-made to contain all relevant PBDEs and PBBs at levels close to the legal limit.

At an international level, in May 2009 the Parties of the Stockholm Convention for Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) took the decision to list commercial penta-BDE and commercial octa-BDE as POP substances. This listing is due to the properties of hexa-BDE (hexabromodiphenyl ether) and hepta-BDE (heptabromodiphenyl ether) which are the main components of commercial octa-BDE, and due to the properties of tetra-BDE (tetrabromodiphenyl ether) and penta-BDE (pentabromodiphenyl ether) which are the main components of commercial penta-BDE.<ref>http://chm.pops.int/Convention/ThePOPs/TheNewPOPs/tabid/2511/Default.aspx</ref>
