'''Reactive arthritis''' is classified as an [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] condition that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body (cross-reactivity). Coming into contact with bacteria and developing an infection can trigger the disease.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reactive Arthritis (Reiter's Syndrome)|author=Mayo Staff|publisher=Mayo Clinic|date=March 5, 2011|accessdate=May 16, 2011|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/reactive-arthritis/DS00486}}</ref> By the time the patient presents with symptoms, oftentimes the "trigger" infection has been cured or is in remission in chronic cases, thus making determination of the initial cause difficult.

The clinical pattern of reactive arthritis commonly consists of an [[inflammatory arthritis|inflammation]] of fewer than five joints which often includes the knee or [[sacroiliac joint]]. The arthritis may be "additive" (more joints become inflamed in addition to the primarily affected one) or "migratory" (new joints become inflamed after the initially inflamed site has already improved).<ref>Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases, By John H. Klippel, page 218</ref><ref>Rheumatology in Practice,  By J. A. Pereira da Silva, Anthony D. Woolf page 5.9</ref>

The arthritis often is coupled with other characteristic symptoms; this is called '''Reiter's Syndrome''' or '''Reiter's arthritis'''. The manifestations of Reiter's Syndrome include the following triad of symptoms: an inflammatory arthritis of large joints, inflammation of the eyes in the form of [[conjunctivitis]] or [[uveitis]], and [[urethritis]] in men or [[cervicitis]] in women. Patients can also present with mucocutaneous lesions, as well as [[psoriasis]]-like skin lesions such as [[circinate balanitis]], and [[keratoderma blennorrhagica]]. [[Enthesitis]] can involve the Achilles tendon resulting in heel pain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Color atlas and synopsis of sexually transmitted diseases, Volume 236|author=H.

The most common triggers are intestinal infections (with [[Salmonella]], [[Shigella]] or [[Campylobacter]]) and sexually transmitted infections (with [[Chlamydia trachomatis]] or [[Neisseria gonorrheae]]). 

It most commonly strikes individuals aged 20–40 years of age, is more common in men than in women, and more common in white than in black people. This is owing to the high frequency the of HLA-B27 gene in the white population.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undifferentiated spondyloarthritis: a longterm followup|author=Sampaio-Barros PD, Bortoluzzo AB, Conde RA, Costallat LT, Samara AM, Bértolo MB|publisher=The Journal of Rheumatology|date= June 2010|pmid=20436080|doi=10.3899/jrheum.090625|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1195–1199|journal=The Journal of Rheumatology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Prevalence and clinical characteristics of ankylosing spondylitis in Iceland - a nationwide study|author=Geirsson AJ, Eyjolfsdottir H, Bjornsdottir G, Kristjansson K, Gudbjornsson B|publisher=Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology|date=May 2010|pmid=20406616|volume=28|issue=3|pages=333–40|journal=Clinical and experimental rheumatology}}</ref> Patients with [[HIV]] have an increased risk of developing Reactive arthritis as well.

A large number of cases during World Wars I and II focused attention on the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis (often with additional mucocutaneous lesions) which at that time was also referred to as "Fiessenger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome". These eponyms are now of historic interest only.<ref>Harrison's Rheumatology, Second Edition [Anthony Fauci, Carol Langford], Ch.9 THE SPONDYLOARTHRITIDES, Reactive Arthritis, page.134</ref> 

==Name==
The condition is also known as '''arthritis urethritica''', '''venereal arthritis''' and '''polyarteritis enterica'''. The name "Reiter’s syndrome", named after the German physician [[Hans Conrad Julius Reiter]] for his contributions to identification and description of the disease, has become unpopular in the past decade as Reiter's history of Nazi party membership, forced human experimentation in the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], and subsequent [[Nuremberg Trials|prosecution in Nuremberg]] as a [[war criminal]], have come to light.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=D. J. |last=Wallace |first2=M. |last2=Weisman |title=Should a war criminal be rewarded with eponymous distinction?

==Signs and symptoms==
Because common systems involved include the eye, the urinary system, and the hands and feet, one clinical [[mnemonic]] for Reiter's syndrome is "Can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree."

Symptoms generally appear within 1–3 weeks but can range from 4 to 35 days from the onset of the inciting episode of the disease.

The classical presentation of the syndrome starts with urinary symptoms such as burning pain on urination ([[dysuria]]) or an increased [[frequency]] of urination. Other urogenital problems may arise such as [[prostatitis]] in men and [[cervicitis]], [[salpingitis]] and/or [[vulvovaginitis]] in women.

The [[arthritis]] that follows usually affects the large joints such as the [[knee]]s causing [[pain]] and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] with relative sparing of small joints such as the wrist and hand.

Eye involvement occurs in about 50% of men with urogenital reactive arthritis syndrome and about 75% of men with enteric reactive arthritis syndrome. [[Conjunctivitis]] and [[uveitis]] can include redness of the eyes, eye pain and irritation, or blurred vision. Eye involvement typically occurs early in the course of reactive arthritis, and symptoms may come and go.

[[File:Feet-Reiters syndrome.jpg|thumb|Keratoderma blennorrhagica due to Reactive arthritis]]
Roughly 20 to 40 percent of the men with the disease develop penile lesions called [[balanitis circinata]] (circinate balanitis). A small percentage of men and women develop small hard [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]s called [[keratoderma blennorrhagica]] on the soles of the feet and, less commonly, on the palms of the hands or elsewhere. In addition, some individuals with reactive arthritis develop mouth ulcers that come and go. In some cases, these ulcers are painless and go unnoticed. Some patients suffer serious gastrointestinal problems similar to those of the [[Crohn's disease]].

About 10 percent of the people with reactive arthritis, especially those with a prolonged course of the disease, will develop cardiac manifestations, including [[aortic regurgitation]] and [[pericarditis]]. Reiter's Syndrome has been described as a pre-cursor for other joint conditions, including [[ankylosing spondylitis]].

In the [[oral cavity]], the patients may suffer from [[recurrent aphthous stomatitis]], [[geographic tongue]] and [[migratory stomatitis]] in higher prevalence than the general population.<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962210004883}}</ref>

==Causes==
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
It is set off by a preceding [[infection]], the most common of which would be a genital infection with ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' in the US. Other bacteria known to cause reactive arthritis which are more common worldwide are ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'' spp., ''[[Shigella]]'' spp., ''[[Yersinia]]'' spp., and ''[[Campylobacter]]'' spp.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hill Gaston JS, Lillicrap MS |title=Arthritis associated with enteric infection |journal=Best pract ice & research. Clinical rheumatology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=219–239 |year=2003 |pmid=12787523 |doi=10.1016/S1521-6942(02)00104-3}}</ref> A bout of [[food poisoning]] or a [[gastrointestinal]] infection may also precede the disease (those last four [[Genus|genera]] of bacteria mentioned are enteric bacteria). There is some circumstantial evidence for other organisms causing the disease, but the details are unclear.<ref>{{cite book | last=Paget | first=Stephen | title=Manual of Rheumatology and Outpatient Orthopedic Disorders: Diagnosis and Therapy |edition=4th | publisher=Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins | year=2000 | pages=chapter 36 | isbn=0-7817-1576-8 }}</ref> Reiter's Syndrome usually manifests about 1–3 weeks after a known infection. The mechanism of interaction between the infecting organism and the host is unknown. Synovial fluid cultures are negative, suggesting that reactive arthritis is caused either by an over-stimulated autoimmune response or by bacterial antigens which have somehow become deposited in the joints.

==Diagnosis==
There are few clinical symptoms, but the clinical picture is dominated by arthritis in one or more joints, resulting in pain, swelling, redness, and heat sensation in the affected areas.

The [[urethra]], [[cervix]] and the [[throat]] may be swabbed in an attempt to [[Microbiological culture|culture]] the causative organisms. Cultures may also be carried out on [[urine]] and [[human feces|stool]] samples or on fluid attained by [[arthrocentesis]].

Tests for [[C-reactive protein]] and [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] are non-specific tests that can be done to corroborate the diagnosis of the syndrome.
Also, a blood test for the genetic marker [[HLA-B27]] may be performed. About 75 percent of all the patients with Reiter's arthritis display this gene. 

===Diagnostic Criteria===

Although there are no definitive criteria to diagnose the existence of reactive arthritis, the [[American College of Rheumatology]] has published [[sensitivity and specificity]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arthritis and Rheumatism|author=American College of Rheumatology|accessdate=May 16, 2011|url=http://www.rheumatology.org/publications/ar/index.asp}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The main goal of treatment is to identify and eradicate the underlying infectious source with the appropriate [[antibiotic]]s if still present. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic for each problem. [[analgesia|Analgesics]] particularly [[NSAIDs]], [[sulfasalazine]], [[steroid]]s and [[immunosuppressant]]s may be needed for patients with severe reactive symptoms that do not respond to any other treatment.

==Prognosis==
Reactive arthritis may be self-limiting, frequently recurring, chronic or progressive. Most patients have severe symptoms lasting a few weeks to six months. Fifteen to 50 percent of cases have recurrent bouts of arthritis. Chronic arthritis or sacroiliitis occurs in 15-30 percent of cases. Repeated attacks over many years are common, and patients sometimes end up with chronic and disabling [[arthritis]], [[heart disease]], [[amyloid]] deposits, [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[immunoglobulin A]] [[nephropathy]], cardiac conduction abnormalities, or [[aortitis]] with [[aortic regurgitation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Reactive Arthritis|author=eMedicine/Medscape|date=Jan 5, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2011|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331347-overview}}</ref> However, most people with reactive arthritis can expect to live [[life expectancy|normal life spans]] and maintain a near-normal lifestyle with modest adaptations to protect the involved organs.

==Epidemiology==

Because women may be underdiagnosed, the exact incidence of reactive arthritis is difficult to estimate. A few studies have been completed, though. In [[Norway]] between 1988 and 1990, incidence was 4.6 cases per 100,000 for Chlamydia-induced Reiter's Syndrome and 5 cases per 100,000 for that induced by enteric bacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kvien |last2=Glennas |first2=A. |last3=Melby |first3=K. |title=Reactive arthritis: Incidence, triggering agents and clinical presentation |journal=[[Journal of Rheumatology]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=115–22 |year=1994 |pmid=8151565 |first=T. |first4=K |last5=Andrup |first5=O |last6=Karstensen |first6=B |last7=Thoen |first7=JE |display-authors=4 |last4=Granfors }}</ref> In 1978 in [[Finland]], the annual incidence was found to be 43.6 per 100,000.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Isomäki |first=H. |last2=Raunio |first2=J. |last3=von Essen |first3=R. |last4=Hämeenkorpi |first4=R. |title=Incidence of rheumatic diseases in Finland |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Rheumatology |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=188–192 |year=1979 |pmid=310157 |doi=10.3109/03009747809095652 }}</ref>
