'''Kabuki syndrome''', also previously known as '''Kabuki makeup syndrome''', '''KMS''' or '''Niikawa–Kuroki Syndrome''', is a  pediatric [[congenital disorder]] of suspected genetic origin [http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/august2010/08232010kabuki.htm][http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n9/full/ng.646.html] with multiple [[congenital anomalies]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. It is quite rare, affecting roughly one in 32,000 births.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kabuki syndrome|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kabuki-syndrome|publisher=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref>  It was discovered and described in 1981 by two Japanese groups, led by the scientists Niikawa and Kuroki.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=  10.1016/S0022-3476(81)80256-9 |author=  Yoshikazu Kuroki, Yasuyuki Suzuki, Hiroyuki Chyo, Akira Hata, Ichiro Matsui |title=A new malformation syndrome of long palpebralfissures, large ears, depressed nasal tip, and skeletal anomalies associated with postnatal dwarfism and mental retardation |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=570–573 |year=1981 |month=October |pmid=7277097 |url=http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476%2881%2980256-9/abstract}}</ref> It is named Kabuki Syndrome because of the facial resemblance of affected individuals with white [[Kabuki]] makeup, a Japanese traditional theatrical form. On the Kabuki Syndrome listserv, children with this syndrome are called Kabuki Kids, or KKs.

== Description ==
There is a wide range of congenital problems associated with Kabuki syndrome with large differences between affected individuals. Some of the common problems are heart defects (30%), urinary tract anomalies, hearing loss (50%), [[hypotonia]], and postnatal growth deficiency (83%). Other characteristics include skeletal abnormality, joint laxity, [[short stature]], and unusual [[Dermatoglyphics|dermatoglyphic]] patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |author=den Biggelaar AM, Kuijpers-Jagtman AM, Bergé SJ, Katsaros C |title=Kabuki-syndroom, een congenitaal syndroom met multipele anomalieën (Kabuki syndrome, a congenital syndrome with multiple anomalies) |language=[[Dutch language|Dutch]] |journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift Voor Tandheelkunde |volume=113 |issue=12 |pages=516–9 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17193989 |doi= |url=http://beheer.ntvt.nl/UserFiles/PDF/NV_1206_R08_516.pdf |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> They often suffer from recurrent [[ear infections]] in infancy.

In terms of development, mild to moderate [[intellectual disability]] is a common feature, seen in 92% of patients. Also, children with Kabuki syndrome often have distinctive behavioural features. For example, 50% are described as unusually sociable, 30% as engaging in only minimal interaction with others, 74% as liking routine and 87% as having a happy disposition. A few have normal intelligence, most of whom have learning difficulties such as struggling with fine motor, speech skills, and memory. 

There is no indication that the [[life expectancy]] of individuals with Kabuki syndrome is shortened. Most medical issues are resolved with medical intervention. The fact that there are relatively few adults known with this syndrome is probably related to its recent discovery in 1980 in Japan and around 1990 in Europe and America.

==Appearance==
[[image:Kabuki syndrome.jpg|thumb|right|A young patient displaying the facial phenotype typical of Kabuki syndrome]]
The facial appearance of individuals with this syndrome include long [[eyelids]] with turning up of the [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] third of the lower eyelid, a broad and depressed [[Human nose|nasal]] tip, large prominent [[earlobe]]s, and a cleft or high-arched palate.

Other clinical features often include [[scoliosis]], short fifth [[finger]], persistence of [[fingerpad]]s, and [[X-ray]] abnormalities of the [[vertebrae]], [[hands]], and [[hip joint]]s.

== Causes ==
Inheritance is thought to be [[autosomal dominant]] or [[X-linked recessive]]; several [[chromosomal abnormalities]] have been found, but none of them appear to be specific to Kabuki Syndrome.
In August 2010, a study<ref name="pmid20711175">{{cite journal| author=Ng SB| title=Exome sequencing identifies MLL2 mutations as a cause of Kabuki syndrome | journal=Nat Genet | year= 2010 | volume=  42| issue=  9| pages=  790–3| pmid=20711175| pmc=2930028 | doi=10.1038/ng.646| author-separator=,| author2=Bigham AW| author3=Buckingham KJ| author4=Hannibal MC| author5=McMillin MJ| author6=Gildersleeve HI| display-authors=6| last7=Beck| first7=Anita E| last8=Tabor| first8=Holly K| last9=Cooper| first9=Gregory M }}</ref><ref>http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/exome-sequencing-study-yields-kabuki-syndrome-gene</ref> found that two thirds of the cases have a loss-of-function mutation in the [[MLL2]] gene, which is coding for a [[histone methyltransferase]]; it can participate in [[epigenetics|epigenetic programming]], and is thought to contribute to [[developmental biology|developmental processes]].

== Terminology ==
Several authors have recommended that the term 'make-up' be removed from the designation of this syndrome because some families considered the term objectionable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hughes HE, Davies SJ |title=Coarctation of the aorta in Kabuki syndrome |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=512–4 |year=1994 |month=June |pmid=8048822 |pmc=1029872 |doi= 10.1136/adc.70.6.512 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Burke LW, Jones MC |title=Kabuki syndrome: underdiagnosed recognizable pattern in cleft palate patients |journal=The Cleft Palate-craniofacial Journal |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=77–84 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=7727492 |doi= 10.1597/1545-1569(1995)032<0077:KSURPI>2.3.CO;2 |url= }}</ref>
