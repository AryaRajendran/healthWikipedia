'''Kidney development''', or '''nephrogenesis''', describes the [[embryology|embryologic]] origins of the [[kidney]], a major organ in the [[urinary system]]. It is often considered in the broader context of the [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]].

==Phases==
The development of the kidney proceeds through a series of successive phases, each marked by the development of a more advanced kidney: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bruce M. Carlson |title=Human Embryology and Developmental Biology |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |edition=3rd edition |year=2004 |isbn=0-323-03649-X}}</ref> The pronephros is the most immature form of kidney, while the metanephros is most developed. The metanephros persists as the definitive adult kidney.

===Pronephros===
{{Main|Pronephros}}
The pronephros develops in the cervical region of the embryo.
During approximately day 22 of human [[gestation]], the paired pronephri appear towards the cranial end of the [[intermediate mesoderm]]. In this region, [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells arrange themselves in a series of tubules called [[nephrotome]]s and join laterally with the [[pronephric duct]]. This duct is fully contained within the embryo and thus cannot excrete filtered material outside the embryo; therefore the pronephros is considered nonfunctional in mammals.

===Mesonephros===
{{Main|Mesonephros}}

The development of the pronephric duct proceeds in a cranial-to-caudal direction. As it elongates caudally, the pronephric duct induces nearby intermediate mesoderm in the thoracolumbar area to become epithelial tubules called [[mesonephric tubule]]s. Each mesonephric tubule receives a blood supply from a branch of the [[aorta]], ending in a capillary tuft analogous to the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]] of the definitive [[nephron]]. The mesonephric tubule forms a capsule around the capillary tuft, allowing for filtration of blood. This filtrate flows through the mesonephric tubule and is drained into the continuation of the pronephric duct, now called the [[mesonephric duct]] or [[Wolffian duct]]. The nephrotomes of the pronephros degenerate while the mesonephric duct extends towards the most caudal end of the embryo, ultimately attaching to the [[cloaca]]. The mammalian mesonephros is similar to the kidneys of [[amphibian|aquatic amphibian]]s and [[fish]]es.

===Metanephros===
During the fifth week of gestation, the mesonephric duct develops an outpouching, the [[ureteric bud]], near its attachment to the cloaca. This bud, also called the metanephrogenic diverticulum, grows posteriorly and towards the head of the embryo. The elongated stalk of the ureteric bud, called the [[metanephric duct]], later forms the [[ureter]]. As the cranial end of the bud extends into the intermediate mesoderm, it undergoes a series of branchings to form the [[collecting duct system]] of the kidney. It also forms the major and minor [[renal calyx|calyces]] and the [[renal pelvis]].

The portion of undifferentiated intermediate mesoderm in contact with the tips of the branching ureteric bud is known as the metanephrogenic blastema. Signals released from the ureteric bud induce the differentiation of the metanephrogenic blastema into the [[renal tubule]]s. As the renal tubules grow, they come into contact and join with [[connecting tubule]]s of the collecting duct system, forming a continuous passage for flow from the renal tubule to the collecting duct. Simultaneously, precursors of vascular endothelial cells begin to take their position at the tips of the renal tubules. These cells differentiate into the cells of the definitive [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]].

In humans, all of the branches of the ureteric bud and the nephronic units have been formed by 32 to 36 weeks of gestation. However, these structures are not yet mature, and will continue to mature after birth. Once matured, humans have an estimated one million nephrons (approximately 500,000 per kidney) or more.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==Migration==
After inducing the metanephric mesenchyme the lower portions of the nephric duct will migrate caudally (downward) and connect with the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], thereby forming the [[ureters]]. The ureters will carry urine from the [[kidneys]] to the bladder for excretion from the [[fetus]] into the [[amniotic sac]]. As the [[fetus]] develops, the [[torso]] elongates and the [[kidneys]] rotate and migrate upwards within the [[abdomen]] which causes the length of the [[ureters]] to increase.
