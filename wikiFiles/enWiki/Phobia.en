{{About|the clinical psychology}}
A '''phobia''' (from the {{lang-el|φόβος}}, ''[[Phobos (moon)|Phóbos]]'', meaning "fear" or "morbid fear") is, when used in the context of [[clinical psychology]], a type of [[anxiety disorder]], usually defined as a persistent fear of an object or situation in which the sufferer commits to great lengths in avoiding, typically disproportional to the actual danger posed, often being recognized as irrational. In the event the phobia cannot be avoided entirely, the sufferer will endure the situation or object with marked [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] and significant interference in social or occupational activities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourne|first=Edmund J.|title=The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook 5th ed.|year=2011|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=572244135|pages=50–51}}</ref>

The terms ''distress'' and ''impairment'' as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) should also take into account the context of the sufferer's environment if attempting a diagnosis. The DSM-IV-TR states that if a phobic stimulus, whether it be an object or a social situation, is absent entirely in an environment&nbsp;— a diagnosis cannot be made.  An example of this situation would be an individual who has a fear of mice ([[Suriphobia]]) but lives in an area devoid of mice.  Even though the concept of mice causes marked distress and impairment within the individual, because the individual does not encounter mice in the environment no actual distress or impairment is ever experienced.  Proximity and the degree to which escape from the phobic stimulus is impossible should also be considered.  As the sufferer approaches a phobic stimulus, anxiety levels increase (e.g. as one gets closer to a snake, fear increases in [[ophidiophobia]]), and the degree to which escape of the phobic stimulus is limited has the effect of varying the intensity of fear in instances such as riding an elevator (e.g. anxiety increases at the midway point between floors and decreases when the floor is reached and the doors open).<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.|year=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-89042-062-9|page=406}}</ref>

The term phobia is encompassing and usually discussed in terms of [[specific phobias]] and [[social phobia]]s. Specific phobias are nouns such as [[arachnophobia]] or [[acrophobia]] which are specific, and social phobias are phobias within social situations such as public speaking and crowded areas.

==Clinical phobias==
[[Psychologist]]s and [[psychiatrist]]s classify most phobias into three categories<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allpsych.com/journal/phobias.html |title=AllPsych Journal &#124; Phobias: Causes and Treatments |publisher=Allpsych.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/numbers.cfm |title=NIMH&nbsp;— The Numbers Count: Mental Disorders in America |publisher=Nimh.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> and, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ([[DSM-IV]]), such phobias are considered to be sub-types of [[anxiety disorder]]. The three categories are:

1. [[Social phobia]]: fear of other people or social situations such as performance anxiety or fears of embarrassment by scrutiny of others. Overcoming social phobia is often very difficult without the help of therapy or support groups. Social phobia may be further subdivided into
::*[[Social anxiety disorder|generalized social phobia]] (also known as [[social anxiety disorder]] or simply [[social anxiety]]).
::*[[specific social phobia]], in which [[anxiety]] is triggered only in specific situations.<ref name="Crozier">{{Cite book |last1=Crozier |first1=W. Ray |last2=Alden |first2=Lynn E. |title=''International Handbook of Social Anxiety: Concepts, Research, and Interventions Relating to the Self and Shyness'' |page=12 |publisher=New York John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. (UK) |year=2001 |isbn=0-471-49129-2}}</ref> The symptoms may extend to psychosomatic manifestation of physical problems. For example, sufferers of [[paruresis]] find it difficult or impossible to urinate in reduced levels of privacy. This goes far beyond mere preference: when the condition triggers, the person physically cannot empty their bladder.

2. [[Specific phobia]]s: fear of a single specific [[-phobia|panic trigger]] such as [[Arachnophobia|spiders]], [[Ophidiophobia|snakes]], [[Cynophobia|dogs]], [[Aquaphobia|water]], [[Acrophobia|heights]], flying, catching a specific illness, etc. Many people have these fears but to a lesser degree than those who suffer from specific phobias. People with the phobias specifically avoid the entity they fear.

3. [[Agoraphobia]]: a generalized fear of leaving home or a small familiar 'safe' area, and of possible [[panic attack]]s that might follow. It may also be caused by various specific phobias such as fear of open spaces, social embarrassment (social agoraphobia), fear of contamination (fear of germs, possibly complicated by [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]) or [[PTSD]] ([[post traumatic stress disorder]]) related to a trauma that occurred out of doors.

Phobias vary in severity among individuals. Some individuals can simply avoid the subject of their fear and suffer relatively mild anxiety over that fear. Others suffer full-fledged panic attacks with all the associated disabling symptoms. Most individuals understand that they are suffering from an irrational fear, but are powerless to override their panic reaction.

==Specific phobias==
A specific phobia is a marked and persistent fear of an object or situation which brings about an excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of, or anticipating, a specific object; the specific phobias may also include concerns with losing control, panicking, and fainting which is the direct result of an encounter with the phobia.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.|year=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-89042-062-9|page=405}}</ref> Specific phobias are defined in relation to objects or situations whereas social phobias emphasize social fear and the evaluations that might accompany them.

The DSM breaks specific phobias into five subtypes: animal, natural environment, blood-injection-injury, situational, and other.<ref>http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=162</ref>  In children, phobias involving animals, natural environment (darkness), and blood-injection-injury usually develop between the ages of 7 and 9, and these are reflective of normal development.  Additionally, specific phobias are most prevalent in children between ages 10 and 13.<ref name="Bolton, D. 2006">{{cite journal |last1=Bolton |first1= D. |last2=Eley |first2=T.

===Diagnosis===
The diagnostic criteria for 300.29 Specific Phobias as outlined by the [[DSM-IV-TR]] are:

:#Marked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).
:#Exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response, which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed panic attack.
:#The person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable.
:#The phobic situation(s) is avoided or else is endured with intense anxiety or distress.
:#The avoidance, anxious anticipation or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobia.
:#In individuals under the age of 18, the duration is at least 6 months.
:#The anxiety, panic attack, or phobic avoidance associated with the specific object or situation are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, such as [[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]] (e.g., fear of dirt in someone with an obsession about contamination), [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (e.g., avoidance of stimuli associated with a severe stressor), [[separation anxiety disorder]] (e.g., avoidance of school), [[social phobia]] (e.g., avoidance of social situations because of fear of embarrassment), [[panic disorder]] with [[agoraphobia]], or agoraphobia without history of panic disorder.

==Social phobia==
Unlike specific phobias, social phobias include fear of public situations and scrutiny which leads to embarrassment or humiliation in the diagnostic criteria.  In social phobias, there is also a generalized category.  Unlike specific phobias which may develop before the age of 10, social phobias are typically not present until pubertal transition. After this transition, the prevalence of social phobia increases with age.  Many adolescents who develop a social phobia consequently become rejected by their peers. As interpersonal dysfunction is a risk factor for depression, there are some negative outcomes for adolescents with social phobia. For example, about 20% of adolescents diagnosed with a social phobia also suffer from depression and use alcohol or other substances.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

===Diagnosis===
The diagnostic criteria for 300.23 Social Phobia as outlined by the [[DSM-IV-TR]]:

:#A marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be humiliating or embarrassing.
:#Exposure to the feared social situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed [[panic attack]].
:#The person recognized that the fear is excessive or unreasonable.
:#The feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress.
:#The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared social or performance situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational (academic) functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobia.
:#In individuals under age 18, the duration is at least 6 months.
:#The avoidance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (such as a drug of abuse or medication) or a general medical condition that is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, [[separation anxiety disorder]], [[body dysmorphic disorder]], a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], [[schizoid personality disorder]]).
:#If a general medical condition or another mental disorder is present (the fear of exposure to the social or performance situation almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response) is unrelated to it, e.g., the fear is not of [[stuttering]], trembling in [[Parkinson's disease]], or exhibiting abnormal eating behavior in [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]].
:Specify if:
::'''Generalized:''' if the fears include most social situations (also consider the additional diagnosis of [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]]).

;Brain regions involved
Beneath the lateral fissure in the cerebral cortex, the insula, or [[insular cortex]], of the brain has been identified as part of the [[limbic system]], along with cingulated gyrus, hippocampus, corpus collosum, and other nearby cortices. This system has been found to play a role in emotion processing <ref name=Tillors>{{cite journal|last=Tillfors|first=Maria|title=Why do some individuals develop social phobia?

In the frontal lobes, other cortices involved with phobia and fear are the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the [[medial prefrontal cortex]]. In the processing of emotional stimuli, studies on phobic reactions to facial expressions have indicated these areas to be involved in processing and responding to negative stimuli.<ref name=Etkin>{{cite journal|last=Etkin|first=Amit|coauthors=Tobias Egner and Raffael Kalisch|title=Emotional processing in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex|journal=Trends Cogn Sci.|year=2011|month=February|volume=15|issue=2|pages=85–93|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.11.004}}</ref> The ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been said to influence the amygdala by monitoring its reaction to emotional stimuli or even fearful memories.<ref name=Tillors>{{cite journal|last=Tillfors|first=Maria|title=Why do some individuals develop social phobia?

The [[hippocampus]] is a horseshoe shaped structure that plays an important part in the brain’s limbic system because of its role in forming memories and connecting them with emotions and the senses. When dealing with fear, the hippocampus receives impulses from the amygdala that allows it to connect the fear with a certain sense, such as a smell or sound.

;Amygdala's role in memory and fear responses
The [[amygdala]] is an "almond shaped" mass of nuclei that is located deep in the brain’s medial temporal lobe. It processes the events associated with fear and is being linked to anxiety disorders and social phobias. The amygdala's ability to respond to fearful stimuli occurs through the process of fear conditioning. Similar to [[classical conditioning]], the amygdala learns to associate a conditioned stimulus with a negative or avoidant stimulus, creating a conditioned fear response that is often seen in phobic individuals. In this way the amygdala is responsible for not only recognizing ceratin stimuli or cues as dangerous, but plays a role in the storage of threatening stimuli to memory. The basolateral nuclei (or [[basolateral amygdala]]) and the hippocampus interact with the amygdala in the storage of memory, which suggests why memories are often remembered more vividly if they have emotional significance.<ref name=Whalen>{{cite book|title=The Human Amygdala|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|editor=Paul J. Whalen and Elizabeth A. Phelps}}</ref>

In addition to memory, the amygdala also triggers the secretion of [[hormone]]s that affect [[fear]] and [[aggression]]. When the fear or aggression response is initiated, the amygdala releases hormones into the body to put the human body into an "alert" state, which prepares the individual to move, run, fight, etc.<ref name=winerman>Winerman, Lea. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/figuring.html "Figuring Out Phobia"], [[American Psychology Association]]: Monitor on Psychology, August 2007.</ref> This defensive "alert" state and response is generally referred to in psychology as the [[fight-or-flight response]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Inside the brain, however, this stress response can be observed in the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).This circuit incorporates the process of receiving stimuli, interpreting it, and releasing certain hormones into the blood stream. The parvocellular neurosecretary neurons of the hypothalamus release [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) which is sent to the anterior pituitary. Here the pituitary releases [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) which ultimately stimulates the release of [[cortisol]]. In relation to anxiety, the amygdala is responsible for activating this circuit, while the hippocampus is responsible for suppressing it. Glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus monitor the amount of cortisol in the system and through negative feedback can tell the hypothalamus to stop releasing CRH.<ref name=Bear>{{cite book|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781760034|edition=Third|editor=Mark F. Bear, Barry W. Connors, Michael A. Paradiso}}</ref>

Studies on mice engineered to have high concentrations of CRH showed higher levels of anxiety, while those engineered to have no or low amounts of CRH receptors were less anxious. In phobic patients, therefore, high amounts of cortisol may be present, or alternatively, there may be low levels of [[glucocorticoid receptor]]s or even [[serotonin]] (5-HT).<ref name=Bear>{{cite book|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781760034|edition=Third|editor=Mark F. Bear, Barry W. Connors, Michael A. Paradiso}}</ref>

;Disruption by damage
For the areas in the brain involved in emotion—most specifically fear— the processing and response to emotional stimuli can be significantly altered when one of these regions becomes lesioned or damaged. Damage to the cortical areas involved in the limbic system such as the cingulate cortex or frontal lobes have resulted in extreme changes in emotion.<ref name=Bear>{{cite book|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781760034|edition=Third|editor=Mark F. Bear, Barry W. Connors, Michael A. Paradiso}}</ref> Other types of damage include [[Klüver-Bucy Syndrome]] and [[Urbach-Wiethe disease]]. In Klüver-Bucy syndrome, a temporal lobectomy, or removal of the temporal lobes results in changes involving fear and aggression. Specifically, the removal of these lobes results in decreased fear, confirming its role in fear recognition and response. Bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobes, which is known as Urbach-Wiethe disease exhibits similar symptoms of decreased fear and aggression, but also an inability to recognize emotional expressions, especially angry or fearful faces.<ref name=Bear>{{cite book|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781760034|edition=Third|editor=Mark F. Bear, Barry W. Connors, Michael A. Paradiso}}</ref>

The amygdala’s role in learned fear includes interactions with other brain regions in the neural circuit of fear. While lesions in the amygdala can inhibit its ability to recognize fearful stimuli, other areas such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala can affect the region's ability to not only become conditioned to fearful stimuli, but to eventually extinguish them. The basolateral nuclei, through receiving stimulus info, undergo synaptic changes which allow the amygdala to develop a conditioned response to fearful stimuli. Lesions in this area, therefore, have been shown to disrupt the acquisition of learned responses to fear.<ref name=Bear>{{cite book|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781760034|edition=Third|editor=Mark F. Bear, Barry W. Connors, Michael A. Paradiso}}</ref> Likewise, lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (the area responsible for monitoring the amygdala) have been shown to not only slow down the speed of extinguishing a learned fear response, but also how effective or strong the extinction is. This suggests there is a pathway or circuit among the amygdala and nearby cortical areas that process emotional stimuli and influence emotional expression, all of which can be disrupted when an area becomes damaged.<ref name=Tillors>{{cite journal|last=Tillfors|first=Maria|title=Why do some individuals develop social phobia? A review with emphasis on the neurobiological influences|journal=Nord J.}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Phobias are a common form of [[anxiety disorder]]s and distributions are heterogeneous by age and gender.  An [[United States|American]] study by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) found that between 8.7 percent and 18.1 percent of Americans suffer from phobias,<ref>Kessler et al., ''Prevalence, Severity, and Comorbidity of 12-Month DSM-IV Disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication'', June 2005, Archive of General Psychiatry, Volume 20</ref> making it the most common [[mental illness]] among women in all age groups and the second most common illness among men older than 25. Between 4 percent and 10 percent of all children experience specific phobias during their lives,<ref name="Bolton, D. 2006"/> and social phobias occur in one percent to three percent of children and adolescents.{{cn|date=April 2013}}  

A Swedish study found that females have a higher incidence than males (26.5 percent for females and 12.4  percent for males).<ref name="Fredrikson1996">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561762 Fredrikson M, Annas P, Fischer H, Wik G., "Gender and age differences in the prevalence of specific fears and phobias.", Behav Res Ther. 1996 Jan;34(1) 33-9.]</ref> Among adults, 21.2 percent of women and 10.9 percent of men have a single specific phobia, while multiple phobias occur in 5.4 percent of females and 1.5 percent of males.<ref name="Fredrikson1996" />  Women are nearly four times as likely as men to have a fear of animals (12.1 percent in women and 3.3 percent in men) — a higher dimorphic than with all specific or generalized phobias or social phobias.<ref name="Fredrikson1996" /> Social phobias are more common in girls than in boys,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Essau | first1 = C.

==Etiology==

===Environmental===
Much of the progress in understanding the acquisition of fear responses in phobias can be attributed to the [[Pavlovian]] Model which is synonymous with [[Classical Conditioning]].<ref name="ProQuest Health and Medical Complete">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=K M|coauthors=M Davis|title=Mechanisms of fear extinction|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=12|issue=2|pages=120–150 |doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001939 |url=http://proquest.umi.com.libris.mtsac.edu/pqdweb?index=51&did=1201968761&SrchMode=1&sid=1&Fmt=6&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName=PQD&TS=1303294470&clientId=132|accessdate=Retrieved April 25, 2011|pmid=17160066}}</ref>  Myers and Davis (2007) describe the acquisition of fear as when a [[conditioned stimulus]] (e.g., a distinctive place) is paired with an aversive [[unconditioned stimulus]] (e.g. a electric shock) to an end result in which the subject exhibits a conditioned feared response to the distinctive place (CS+UCS=CR).  With the fear of heights, or acrophobia the CS is heights such as the top floors of a high rise building or a roller coaster. The UCS can be said to originate from an aversive or traumatizing event in the person's life such as being trapped on a roller coaster as a child or in an elevator at the top floor of a building.  The result of combining these two stimuli leads to a new association called the CR (fear of heights) which is simply the CS (heights) transformed by the aversive UCS (being trapped on a roller coaster or elevator) leading to the feared [[conditioned response]].  This model does not suggest that a conditioned feared response to an object or situation is always a phobia.  To meet the criteria for being diagnosed with a phobia symptoms of impairment and avoidance must be shown.  Impairment, which can be considered along the same lines as a disability from a clinician's standpoint, is defined as being unable to complete routine tasks whether occupational, academic or social. In acrophobia an impairment of occupation could result from not taking a job solely because of its location at the top floor of a building, or socially not participating in a social event at a theme park.  The avoidance aspect is defined as behavior that results in the omission of an aversive event that would otherwise occur with the goal of the preventing anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bolles|first=R. C.|title=Species-specific Defense Reactions and Avoidance Learning|journal=Psychological Review|year=1970|volume=77|pages=32–38|doi=10.1037/h0028589}}</ref>  The direct conditioning model, though very influential in the theory of fear acquisition, should not suggest the only way to acquire a phobia.  Rachman proposed three main pathways to acquire fear conditioning involving direct conditioning, vicarious acquisition and informational/instructional acquisition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rachman|first=S.J.|title=Fear and Courage|year=1978|publisher=WH Freeman & Co.|location=San Francisco}}</ref>

More than just classical conditioning can influence the onset of a phobia.  Rachman (1978) proposed that vicarious acquisition was a critical component to the etiology of phobias, thus information and instruction from the parent and family members is also needed to better understand its onset. Of the research conducted in this area, one of the best examples of how vicarious conditioning, more specifically modeling, effects the acquisition of a phobia comes from Cook and Mineka's (1989) work on rhesus monkeys.  In this experiment, Cook and Mineka, through the use of video, appraised 22 rhesus monkeys on their fear to evolutionary relevant stimuli (e.g. crocodiles and snakes), and evolutionary irrelevant stimuli (e.g. flowers and artificial rabbits) to see if fear conditioning using the direct conditioning model (Pavlov's model) leads to fear acquisition (or more specifically the conditioned fear response). The results of the research showed that after 12 sessions the rhesus monkeys acquired a fear to the evolutionary relevant stimuli and not to the evolutionary irrelevant stimuli; furthermore, the experiment also revealed that when they exposed monkeys to other monkeys that interacted with snakes without showing fear, this group did not acquire the fear, which supports the theory of vicarious conditioning through modeling.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=Michael|coauthors=Mineka, Susan|title=Observational conditioning of fear to fear-relevant versus fear-irrelevant stimuli in rhesus monkeys|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1989|volume=98|issue=4|pages=448–459|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.98.4.448|pmid=2592680}}</ref>  According to Pavlov's theory of classical conditioning, the experimenters should have been able to condition a feared response within the rhesus monkeys to the evolutionary irrelevant stimuli because the Pavlovian model posits that any UCS can elicit a CR.  The result shows the necessary augmentation of the Pavlov model with the vicarious acquisition model.

===Evolutionary===
The circumstance that specific phobias tend to be directed disproportionately against certain objects such as snakes and spiders may have [[evolutionary]] explanations. In this view phobias are [[adaptation]]s that may have been useful in the ancestral environment. On the [[savanna]], unlike dangers such as large predators, snakes and spiders tend to be hidden from view until very close and may be a particular danger to infants and small children, favoring the development of an instinctive fearful response. This view does not necessarily hold that phobias are genetically inevitable. Instead, there may be a genetic predisposition to learn to fear certain things more easily than others.<ref>Why do we think spiders and snakes are so scary? It just might be evolution,  Mark Roth, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Wednesday, March 07, 2007</ref> 

Similarly, primary [[agoraphobia]] may be due to its once having been evolutionary advantageous to avoid exposed, large open spaces without cover or concealment. [[Generalized social phobia]] may be due to its once being usually very dangerous to be confronted by a large group of staring, non-kin, unknown, and not smiling strangers.<ref name="doi10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008}}</ref>

Sexual dimorphism, with women having much higher incidence of phobias than men, may be a result of selection during the Mesozoic (mammalian) period reflecting the higher cost to progeny of the loss of nursing females compared to "expendable" males.<ref name="doi10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008"/>

==Treatments==
Various methods are claimed to treat phobias. Their proposed benefits may vary from person to person.

Some therapists use [[virtual reality]] or imagery exercise to [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitize]] patients to the feared entity. These are parts of [[systematic desensitization]] therapy.

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) can be beneficial. Cognitive behavioral therapy allows the patient to challenge dysfunctional thoughts or beliefs by being mindful of their own feelings with the aim that the patient will realize their fear is irrational. CBT may be conducted in a group setting. Gradual desensitisation treatment and CBT are often successful, provided the patient is willing to endure some discomfort.<ref name=hall>Hall, Lynne L.

CBT is also an effective treatment for phobias in children and adolescents, and it has been adapted to be appropriate for use with this age.  One example of a CBT program targeted towards children is the Coping Cat.  This treatment program can be used with children between the ages of 7 and 13 to treat social phobia.  This program works to decrease negative thinking, increase problem solving, and to provide a functional coping outlook in the child.<ref>Kendall, P. C., Aschenbrand, S. G., & Hudson, J. L. (2003). Child-focused treatment of anxiety. In A. E. Kazdin, J. R. Weisz (Eds.) , Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (pp. 81-100). New York, NY US: Guilford Press</ref>  Another CBT program was developed by Ann Marie Albano to treat social phobia in adolescents.  This program has five stages: Psychoeducation, Skill Building, Problem Solving, Exposure, and Generalization and Maintenance.  Psycho education focuses on identifying and understanding symptoms.  Skill Building focuses on learning cognitive restructuring, social skills, and problem solving skills.  Problem Solving focuses on identifying problems and using a proactive approach to solving them.  Exposure involves exposing the adolescent to social situations in a hierarchical approach.  Finally, Generalization and Maintenance involves practicing the skills learned.<ref>Albano, A. (2003). Treatment of social anxiety disorder. In M. A. Reinecke, F. M. Dattilio, A. Freeman (Eds.) , Cognitive therapy with children and adolescents: A casebook for clinical practice (2nd ed.) (pp. 128-161). New York, NY US: Guilford Press.</ref>

[[Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing]] (EMDR) has been demonstrated in peer-reviewed clinical trials to be effective in treating some phobias. Mainly used to treat [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]], EMDR has been demonstrated as effective in easing phobia symptoms following a specific trauma, such as a fear of dogs following a dog bite.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = De Jongh | first1 = A | last2 = Ten Broeke | first2 = E | last3 = Renssen | first3 = M R. | year = 1999 | title = Treatment of specific phobias with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): protocol, empirical status, and conceptual issues | url = | journal = Journal of anxiety disorders | volume = 13 | issue = 1-2| pages = 69–85 }}</ref>

[[Hypnotherapy]] coupled with [[Neuro-linguistic programming]] can also be used to help remove the associations that trigger a phobic reaction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hypnotist removes phobias with hypnotherapy and NLP |url=http://www.comedywood.com/video/maury-phobias1.wmv |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> However, lack of research and scientific testing compromises its status as an effective treatment.

Antidepressant medications such [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]], [[MAOIs]] may be helpful in some cases of phobia. [[Benzodiazepines]] may be useful in acute treatment of severe symptoms but the risk benefit ratio is against their long-term use in phobic disorders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stein |first1=Dan J |title=Clinical Manual of Anxiety Disorders |url=http://books.google.com/?id=44reFIgFDBMC |edition=1st |date=16 February Fears are common in children and adolescents. However, for some youth, these fears persist and develop into specific phobias. A specific phobia is an intense, enduring fear of an identifiable object or situation that may lead to panic symptoms, distress, and avoidance (e.g., fears of dogs, snakes, storms, heights, costumed characters, the dark, and similar objects or situations). Moreover, phobias can affect a youngster's quality of life by interfering with school, family, friends, and free-time. It is estimated that 5% to 10% of youth will develop a phobia before reaching the age of 16. 2004 |publisher=American Psychiatric Press Inc |location=USA |isbn=978-1-58562-076-0 |page=53 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref>

There are also new pharmacological approaches, which target learning and memory processes that occur during psychotherapy. For example, it has been shown that [[glucocorticoids]] can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21444799 | pmid = 21444799 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1018214108 | volume=108 | issue=16 | title=Glucocorticoids enhance extinction-based psychotherapy | pmc=3081033 | year=2011 | month=April | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | pages=6621–5}}</ref>

[[Emotional Freedom Technique]], a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] [[alternative medicine]] tool, also considered to be [[pseudoscience]] by the mainstream medicine, is allegedly useful.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Another method psychologists and psychiatrists use to treat patients with extreme phobias is prolonged exposure. Prolonged exposure is used in psychotherapy when the person with the phobia is exposed to the object of their fear over a long period of time. This technique is only tested{{clarify|date=August 2012}} when a person has overcome avoidance of or escape from the phobic object or situation. People with slight distress from their phobias usually do not need prolonged exposure to their fear.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=J.P.|coauthors=Marks|title=Prolonged Exposure: A Rapid Treatment For Phobias|journal=British Medical Journal|date=2|year=1971|month=January|volume=1|series=5739|issue=1|pages=13–15|accessdate=18 August 2012|jstor=25413031}}</ref>

For children and adolescents, one of the most effective treatments for specific phobias is participant modeling and reinforced practice.  In this treatment method, the therapist models for the child how they should respond to their fears and then encourages the child to practice this behavior and reinforces their efforts.

These treatment options are not mutually exclusive. Often a therapist will suggest multiple treatments.

=== Hypnosis ===
Hypnotherapy may be used along with other therapies to improve common phobias such as agoraphobia,<ref name="Kraft">{{Cite web |url=http://www.londonhypnotherapyuk.com/agoraphobia-social-phobia.asp |title=The place of hypnosis in psychiatry Part 4: Its application to the treatment of agoraphobia and social phobia |last1=Kraft |first1=D. |last2=Street |first2=H. |year=2011 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> and social phobia.<ref name ="Kraft"/><ref name="Rogers">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hypnosis+in+the+treatment+of+social+phobia.-a0229529946 |title=Hypnosis in the treatment of social phobia |last=Rogers |first=Janet |date=May 2008 |journal=Australian Journal of Clinical & Experimental Hypnosis |volume=36 |number=1 |page=64-68}}</ref><ref name="">{{Cite web |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/books/11090/002 |title=Cognitive-Behavioral Hypnotherapy for phobic anxiety |last1=Schoenberger |first1=Nancy E. |year=1996 |journal=Casebook of clinical hypnosis |page=33-49 |location=Washington |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=429 |doi=10.1037/11090-002}}</ref>

Hypnotherapy aims to get the individual into a relaxed state of mind, where the subconscious mind can be engaged. When using hypnosis, a dissociative technique is recommended which  might include, for example, patients watching a younger version of themselves, watching a film or seeing a reflection. The therapist then enables patients to integrate the present with the past, traumatic experience so that they learn from the events and thus become stronger.<ref name="Kraft"/>
	
Psychodynamic psychotherapy may be used at the beginning of each session to encourage the recall of stimuli. Hypnotherapy sessions may be done in groups as some patients may prefer sessions with others who are facing the same situation much like a support group. Overall, treatment is aimed at reducing the debilitating effects of phobias without the use of medication.<ref name="Kraft"/>

==Non-psychological conditions==
The word ''phobia'' may also signify conditions other than fear. For example, although the term ''[[Aquaphobia|hydrophobia]]'' means a fear of water, it may also mean inability to drink water due to an illness, or may be used to describe a chemical compound which repels water. It was also once used as a [[synonym]] for [[rabies]], as an aversion to water is one of its symptoms. Likewise, the term [[photophobia]] may be used to define a physical complaint (i.e. aversion to light due to inflamed eyes or excessively dilated pupils) and does not necessarily indicate a fear of light.

==Non-clinical uses of the term==
{{Main|List of phobias}}<!-- [[Chemophobia#Definition and uses]] links here -->
It is possible for an individual to develop a phobia over virtually anything. The name of a phobia generally contains a Greek word for what the patient fears plus the suffix ''[[-phobia]]''. Creating these terms is something of a [[word game]]. Few of these terms are found in medical literature. However, this does not necessarily make it a non-psychological condition.

===Terms for prejudice or discrimination===<!-- This section is linked from [[Transphobia]]-->

A number of terms with the suffix [[-phobia]] are used non-clinically but have gained public acceptance. Such terms are primarily understood as negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards certain categories of people or other things, used in an [[analogy]] with the medical usage of the term. Usually these kinds of "phobias" are described as fear, dislike, disapproval, [[prejudice]], [[hatred]], [[discrimination]], or hostility towards the object of the "phobia". Often this attitude is based on prejudices and is a particular case of most [[xenophobia]].

Below are some examples:
* [[Homophobia]] - Negative attitudes and feelings toward homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender ([[LGBT]]).
* [[Biphobia]] - Negative attitudes and feelings towards bisexuality and bisexual people as a social group or as individuals.
* [[Transphobia]] - Negative attitudes and feelings towards transsexualism and transsexual or transgender people, based on the expression of their internal gender identity.
* [[Xenophobia]]&nbsp;– fear or dislike of strangers or the unknown, sometimes used to describe nationalistic political beliefs and movements.
