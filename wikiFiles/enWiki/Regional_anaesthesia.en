'''Regional anaesthesia''' (or '''regional anesthesia''') is [[anesthesia|anaesthesia]] affecting a large part of the body, such as a limb or the lower half of the body. Regional anaesthetic techniques can be divided into central and peripheral techniques. The central techniques include so called [[neuraxial blockade]] ([[epidural]] anaesthesia, [[spinal anaesthesia]]). The peripheral techniques can be further divided into plexus blocks such as [[brachial plexus block]]s, and single nerve blocks. Regional anaesthesia may be performed as a single shot or with a continuous catheter through which medication is given over a prolonged period, e.g. [[continuous peripheral nerve block]] (CPNB). Regional anaesthesia can be provided by injecting local anaesthetics directly into the veins of an arm (provided the venous flow is impeded by a tourniquet.) This is called intravenous regional techniques ([[Intravenous regional anesthesia|Bier block]]).

This differs from ''[[Local anesthesia|Local anaesthesia]]'', which, in a strict sense, is [[anesthesia|anaesthesia]] of a small part of the body such as a tooth or an area of skin, and ''Conduction anaesthesia'' is a comprehensive term which encompasses a great variety of local and regional anaesthetic techniques...

==Indications and applications==
Regional anaesthesia may provide anaesthesia (absence of feeling, including [[pain]]) to allow a [[surgical operation]], or provide post-operative pain relief. Various [[brachial plexus block]]s exist for [[shoulder]] and [[arm]] procedures. Methods similar to routine regional anaesthetic techniques are also often used for treating chronic pain.

In labour and [[childbirth]], [[epidural]] or combined spinal epidurals provide effective pain relief. Regional anaesthesia is now more common than general anaesthesia for [[Caesarean section]] procedures.

Nerve blocks are widely used in [[veterinary medicine]] to diagnose lameness.  A very common application is the diagnosis of [[navicular disease]] in [[horse]]s.

== Relationship to other anaesthetic techniques==
Unlike [[general anaesthesia]], patients may remain awake during the procedure, resulting in reduced [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] and enabling the surgeon to converse with the patient during the procedure if required. However, many patients prefer to receive [[sedation]] either during the block, the procedure, or both.

There is a spectrum of complexity between simple local anaesthetic infiltration and major regional blocks, such as the 'central neuraxial blocks' (spinal and epidural), with nerve blocks lying in the middle. [[Nerve block]]s affecting major peripheral nerves such as the [[femoral nerve]] and [[sciatic nerve]] are also sometimes viewed as regional anaesthetic techniques.

==Complications==
Unlike a minor local anaesthetic infiltration to allow a wound to be sutured, or a skin lesion to be excised, regional anaesthesia may involve large doses of [[local anaesthetic]], or administration of the local anaesthetic very close to, or directly into the central nervous system. Therefore there is a risk of complications from local anaesthetic toxicity (such as seizures and cardiac arrest) and for a syndrome similar to [[spinal shock]].

Most regional anaesthetic techniques, even in expert hands, have a failure rate of 1â€“10%. Therefore, general anaesthesia may become necessary even when a procedure was initially planned to be conducted under a regional technique.

For these reasons, regional anaesthesia is only ever conducted in an environment that is fully equipped and staffed to provide safe general anaesthesia should it be needed.
