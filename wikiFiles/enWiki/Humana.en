==History==

===1961-1993: Nursing homes and hospitals===
The company was founded by David A. Jones, Sr. and Wendell Cherry as a [[nursing home]] company in 1961. Then known as Extendicare, the company became the largest nursing home company in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Extendicare later divested the nursing home chain and moved into purchasing [[hospitals]] in 1972, becoming the world's largest hospital company in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The corporate name was changed to Humana Inc. in 1974. Humana experienced tremendous growth in the years that followed, both organically and through the takeover of American Medicorp Inc. in 1978, which doubled the company's size.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} During the mid-1970s, the company used a [[fast-track construction]] process to complete and open one hospital a month.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This accelerated construction schedule, which compressed time by overlapping processes, allowed Humana to develop hospital projects faster than the industry norm.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} During this construction boom, Humana developed the double corridor model for hospital construction. This highly efficient design minimized the distance between patients and nurses by placing nursing support services in the interior of the building with patient rooms surrounding the perimeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Humana brought the pioneering [[artificial heart]] research of Dr. [[Robert Jarvik]] and Dr. [[William DeVries]], the inventor and surgeon of the first artificial heart implant performed at the [[University of Utah]] in 1982, to create the Humana Heart Institute, in Louisville in 1985.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The 1990s marked Humana's transition into a consumer health benefits company. Humana spun off its hospital operations from the health insurance operations in 1993, creating Galen Health Care, which then merged with Columbia/[[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]].

=== 1984-present: Health insurance ===
As the [[Health care in the United States|American health care system]] evolved in the 1980s, Humana developed and began marketing [[health insurance]] products.

[[UnitedHealth Group|United Healthcare]] attempted to acquire Humana in 1998. United's effort failed when it reported an almost billion-dollar quarterly loss. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In 2001, Humana partnered with [[Navigy, Inc.]], a subsidiary of [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross and Blue Shield]] of Florida, Inc., to launch [[Availity]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In 2005, Humana entered into a [[Partnership|business partnership]] with [[Virgin Group]], offering financial incentives to members for healthy behavior, such as regular exercise.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The Business Health Care Group of Southeast Wisconsin (BHCGSW) chose Humana as its administrative partner to help reduce health care costs. Today, the BHCGSW represents more than 200 member companies, including large and small employers representing more than 150,000 health care consumers in Southeastern Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.humana.com/corporatecomm/newsroom/releases/PR-News-20060706-154547-NR.html |title=Humana Press Release |publisher=Humana.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

In 2006, Humana launched an education campaign to market [[Medicare (United States)#Part C: Medicare Advantage plans|Medicare Advantage]] (MA) and [[Medicare Part D|Prescription Drug Plans]] (PDP) nationwide to Medicare eligible consumers, following the passage of the [[Medicare modernization act]].

Humana also launched [[RightSource]], a national [[mail-order]] retail [[pharmacy]] business in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Humana screened the 1942 classic ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' in select [[movie theater]]s nationwide as part of a campaign to preview its Medicare Advantage consumer services in 2007, marking the first time in more than 60 years that the film was seen nationally in movie theaters.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.humana.com/corporatecomm/newsroom/releases/PR-News-20061009-155557-NR.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061109204943/http://www.humana.com/corporatecomm/newsroom/releases/PR-News-20061009-155557-NR.html|archivedate=2006-11-09 |title=Humana Press Release |publisher=Humana.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

In its March 2008 issue, ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' named Humana one of the Top 5 Most Admired Healthcare Companies in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/mostadmired/2008/industries/61.html |title=America's Most Admired Companies 2008: Industry: Health Care: Insurance, Managed Care &#124; FORTUNE |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

In May 2011, Humana announced that they would be using [[mobileStorm]] to allow transmission of protected health information to patients.<ref>[http://www.smartphonehc.com/2011/05/27/mobilestorm-launches-first-hipaa-compliant-cloud-based-mhealth-communication-platform-announces-humana-as-a-beta-client/ mobileStorm Launches First HIPAA-Compliant, Cloud-based mHealth Communication Platform; Announces Humana as a Beta Client].

[[Image:Humana.jpg|thumb|right|Humana headquarters at the [[Humana Building]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]]]

The [[Humana Building]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] is a well-known example of [[postmodern architecture]] designed by [[Michael Graves]] and completed in 1985. Humana sponsored an [[Architectural design competition|architectural competition]] to determine the design of its headquarters building. [[Scale model]]s of the participants (including the submissions of [[Helmut Jahn]], [[I. M. Pei]], Michael Graves and others) are contained in a vestibule located directly above the Main Street entrance.

Humana also operates a state-of-the-art mail-order facility, ''Right''SourceRx. ''Right''SourceRx operates in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester, Ohio]]. The Humana call center is located in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and other areas.

=== Sponsorship ===
Humana is the official health benefits provider of the [[PGA Tour]] and [[Champions Tour]]. PGA Tour player [[David Toms]] and [[LPGA]] player [[Nancy Scranton]] are both ambassadors for Humana.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Humana Military Healthcare Services===
[[Humana Military Healthcare Services]] (HMHS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Humana. Since 2004, HMHS has acted as the Managed Care Support Contractor for the [[United States Department of Defense]] [[Military Health System]] [[TRICARE]] South Region. In 2009, HMHS' Managed Care Support Contract was awarded to United Military and Veterans Services, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group.  HMHS protested that decision. The protest was upheld in late 2009 by the [[Government Accountability Office]].

==Controversy==
In 1987, Humana sued [[NBC]] over a story line in the television [[medical drama]] ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' whereas the hospital was to be sold to a [[Business|for-profit]] medical corporation and renamed "Ecumena", with subsequent changes to the hospital, both positive and negative, emanating from that change. Humana was successful at forcing NBC into showing a disclaimer at the beginning of the September 30 episode saying that the drama had no connection whatsoever with Humana.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3847944.html |title=Humana lawsuit over `St. Elsewhere' prompts TV disclaimer by NBC |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|date=1987-10-01| accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

On May 30, 1996, [[Linda Peeno]], who was contracted to work for Humana for nine months, testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] as to the downside of [[managed care]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nomanagedcare.org/DrPeenotestimony.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080601094042/http://www.nomanagedcare.org/DrPeenotestimony.html |archivedate=2008-06-01 |title=Testimony of Linda Peeno, MD about Managed Care in the Healthcare Industry - May 30, 1996 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>

{{cquote|I wish to begin by making a public confession: In the spring of 1987, as a physician, I caused the death of a man.

Although this was known to many people, I have not been taken before any court of law or called to account for this in any professional or public forum. In fact, just the opposite occurred: I was "rewarded" for this. It bought me an improved reputation in my job, and contributed to my advancement afterwards. Not only did I demonstrate I could indeed do what was expected of me, I exemplified the "good" company doctor: I saved a half million dollars.}}

{{cquote|I contend that "managed care," as we currently know it, is inherently unethical in its organization and operation. Furthermore, I maintain that we have an industry which can exist only through flagrant ethical violations against individuals and the public.}}

Video of Linda Peeno's testimony appeared in [[Michael Moore]]'s 2007 documentary ''[[Sicko]]''. On June 28, 2007, in a statement about the movie, Humana declared that Peeno was never a Humana "associate" (permanent, full-time employee), but rather a "part-time contractor".  Humana also disputed the portions of Congressional testimony that were shown by saying that because the patient's specific healthcare plan didn't cover heart transplants, the denial of coverage was valid.<ref>{{cite news |title=Humana issues statement on Moore's 'Sicko' |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2007/06/25/daily35.html |publisher=[[Business First]] |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

Humana was also featured in Season One of Moore's ''[[The Awful Truth (TV series)|The Awful Truth]]'', shown refusing to give a [[pancreatic failure]] sufferer authorization for a transplant due to a contradictory policy that stated that all of this man's [[diabetes]] related expenses were covered by his plan (his pancreas was failing due to his diabetes) but in another section, it said that it wouldn't cover organ transplants.  Moore conducted a fake funeral on the front steps of Humana for the man who was sure to die without the transplant.  Three days later, Humana changed their policy and authorized the man's treatment.  This scene was the inspiration for ''Sicko''.

On September 21, 2009 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] opened an investigation into mass mailings sent by Humana to elderly Medicare recipients.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/164893.php Medicare Probes Humana's Letter To Patients About Effects Of Health Reform] Medical News Today 23 Sep 2009</ref> The mail was made to appear to contain official information about [[Medicare Advantage]] and prescription drug benefit information, but instead alleged that core Medicare benefits could be cut by the [[Obama administration]]'s healthcare reform,<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dawn-teo/humana-mailer-targets-eld_b_289421.html Humana Mailer Targets Elderly, Claims Medicare Benefits To Be Cut] ''[[Huffington Post]]''. 2009-09-16.</ref> a claim refuted by John Rother, [[AARP]]'s executive vice president.<ref>{{cite web|last=King |first=Neil |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125112553661853921.html |title=GOP Tees Up Medicare Manifesto |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref> Douglas Elmendorf, the head of the [[Congressional Budget Office]], later supported the claim that Medicare benefits would be cut.<ref>[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9ASN4G80 Budget chief says Medicare benefits could be cut] ERICA WERNER, Associated Press.  September 22, 2009</ref> However, his comments were in reference to just one of several bills being drafted in Congress, and CBO estimates of another healthcare reform bill found that changes to premiums would vary.<ref>[http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=348 The Effect of H.R. 3200 on Medicare Part D Premiums] Congressional Budget Office, Director's Blog. August 28, 2009</ref> The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] instructed Humana to cease all such mailings to Medicare plan members pending an investigation.  HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in a letter to the insurance industry, threatened that bad actors may be excluded from new health insurance markets that will open in 2014. However, in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, Senate Republicans pointed out that a 1997 directive from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services explicitly allowed HMOs to tell members about legislation and urge them to express opinions.

== Humana's Prescription Home Delivery ==
In 2006, Humana started a Prescription Home Delivery Pharmacy called RightSourceRx.<ref name="RightSourceRx.com">[http://www.rightsourcerx.com/ RightSourceRx.com]</ref> Members are now able to get a discount on 90 day prescriptions through RightSource, depending on what their plan allows. RightSource just filled their 500,000th prescription in December 2008.
