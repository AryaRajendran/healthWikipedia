'''Crystal Meth Anonymous''' ('''CMA''') is a California-based Non-Profit, Public Benefit Corporation working as a [[twelve-step program|twelve-step fellowship]] of recovered and recovering [[methamphetamine|crystal meth]] addicts. Participants in local groups of varying sizes meet in order to help others recover from methamphetamine addiction. CMA advocates complete abstinence from methamphetamine, [[alcohol]], [[inhalant]]s, and all other [[psychoactive drug]]s not taken as [[Medical prescription|prescribed]].

== History and demographics ==
CMA was founded on September 16, 1994 in [[West Hollywood, California]]. The first group held its first meeting at  the West Hollywood Alcohol and Drug Center, then located on Santa Monica Blvd.<ref name="CMAHISTORY">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalmeth.org/|title=CMA History |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> CMA now has a presence in over 100 metropolitan areas of the United States, as well as parts of [[Canada]], and [[Australia]].<ref name="MEETINGS">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalmeth.org |title=CMA Meeting Areas |accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> The first CMA World Service Conference was held in Park City, Utah from October 17–19, 2008.<ref name="CMACONF">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalmeth.org/|title=CMA World Service Conference 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> At that convention, the CMA Charter was adopted.<ref>CMA World Services</ref> While many members use Alcoholic's Anonymous' "Big Book" as a guide for their program, others use the "Basic Text" of Narcotics Anonymous or that of other 12-step fellowships. At the first General Service Conference, the delegates unanimously adopted the following statement; "The Fellowship of Crystal Meth Anonymous works a Twelve Step program of recovery. We have not felt the need to elaborate in great detail a specific CMA approach to the Twelve Steps: too many other excellent outlines already exist for following these spiritual principles. But our experience has shown that without the Steps we could not stay sober.<ref>CMA General Service Conference, 2008</ref> 

In 2002, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] estimated 12 million people, age 12 and over, had used methamphetamine—600,000 of which were estimated to be current users—with a growth rate of approximately 300,000 new users per year.<ref name="LEE2006"/> In 2005, a Los Angeles clinic estimated that one out of three gay or bisexual HIV-positive men admitted to using methamphetamine.<ref name="LEE2006">{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Steven |title=Crystal Methamphetamine: Current Issues in Addiction and Treatment |url=http://www.addictionrecov.org/paradigm/P_PR_SP06/paradigmSP06.pdf |journal=Paradigm |year=2006 |month=Spring |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref><ref name="WORTH2005">{{cite journal |last = Worth |first=Heather |coauthors=Rawstorne, Patrick |title=Crystallizing the HIV epidemic: methamphetamine, unsafe sex, and gay diseases of the will |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |year=2005 |month=October |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=483–486 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-6274-9 |issn=1573-2800 |pmid = 16211470}}</ref> [[Methamphetamine]] may lower inhibitions, increasing the likelihood of engaging in [[unprotected sex]] and [[Needle sharing|sharing needles]].<ref name="SANELLO2005">{{cite book |last = Sanello |first = Frank |title = Tweakers: How Crystal Meth Is Ravaging Gay America  |publisher=Alyson Publishing |year=2005 |location=[[Los Angeles, California]] |isbn = 1-55583-884-7 |oclc= 56608054}}</ref> In large metropolitan areas, such as [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]] and [[Washington, DC]], many CMA groups are designated as "gay/lesbian" reflecting the use of methamphetamine in urban gay communities.<ref name="LYONS2006B"/>
