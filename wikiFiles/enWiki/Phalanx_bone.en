In anatomy, '''phalanx bones''' (plural phalanges) are bones that form the skeleton of the toes and the fingers.  In primates such as humans and monkeys, the thumbs and big toes have two phalanges while the other digits have three phalanges. They are also classified as long bones.

The phalanges do not have individual names.  They are named for the digit they represent and their relative location from the center of the body ([[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal or distal]]).
* [[Proximal phalanges]] are closest to the main part of the [[hand]] or [[foot]] and articulate with the [[metacarpal]]s of the hand or [[metatarsal]]s of the foot.
* Middle or [[intermediate phalanges]] are between the distal and proximal. The thumb and big toe do not have middle phalanges.
* [[Distal phalanges]] are at the tips of the fingers and toes.

The term phalanx or phalanges refers to an [[Phalanx formation|ancient Greek army formation]] in which soldiers stand side by side, several rows deep, like an arrangement of fingers or toes.

==Phalangeal formula==
The number of phalanges in animals is often expressed as a "phalangeal formula" that indicates the numbers of phalanges in digits, beginning from the innermost ([[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right .28lateral.29.2C and medial|medial]] or [[proximal]]).

Most land [[mammal]]s including humans have a 2-3-3-3-3 formula in both the [[hand]]s (or [[paw]]s) and [[feet]]. Primitive [[reptile]]s typically had the formula 2-3-4-4-5, and this pattern, with some modification, remained in many later reptiles and in the [[mammal-like reptile]]s. The phalangeal formula in the [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]] of [[cetacea]]ns (marine mammals) is 2-12-8-1.
