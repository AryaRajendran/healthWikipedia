'''Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons''' ('''PAH'''s), also known as '''poly-aromatic hydrocarbons''' or '''polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons''', are potent atmospheric pollutants that consist of fused [[aromatic]] [[simple aromatic ring|rings]] and do not contain [[heteroatom]]s or carry [[substituent]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Fetzer |first = J.

PAHs occur in [[oil]], [[coal]], and [[tar]] deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As a pollutant, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic, and [[teratogen]]ic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |publisher=European Commission, Scientific Committee on Food|date=December 4, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Larsson |first=B.

==Occurrence and pollution==
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are [[lipophilic]], meaning they mix more easily with oil than water. The larger compounds are less water-soluble and less [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]. Because of these properties, PAHs in the environment are found primarily in [[soil]], sediment and oily substances, as opposed to in water or air. However, they are also a component of concern in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] suspended in air.

Natural crude oil and coal deposits contain significant amounts of PAHs, arising from chemical conversion of natural product molecules, such as steroids, to aromatic hydrocarbons. They are also found in processed fossil fuels, [[tar]] and various edible oils.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=nmmpK0oDE20C&pg=PA125 |page=125 |title=Activated carbon applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries |author=Glenn Michael Roy |publisher=CRC Press |year=1995 |isbn=1-56676-198-0}}</ref> In a study evaluating the genotoxic and carcinogenic risks associated with the consumption of repeatedly heated coconut oil (RCO), one of the commonly consumed cooking and frying medium, it was concluded that dietary consumption of RCO can cause a genotoxic and preneoplastic change in the liver.<ref name="British Journal of Nutrition">{{cite journal|last=Srivastava, Singh, George, Bhui, Murari Saxena, Shukla|first=Smita, Madhulika, Jasmine, Kulpreet, Anand, Yogeshwer|title=Genotoxic and carcinogenic risks associated with the dietary consumption|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|date=06|year=2010|month=August|doi=10.1017/S0007114510002229|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FBJN104_09%2FS0007114510002229a.pdf&code=92721de968e05e4fa467b20ce538f628|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref> 

PAHs are one of the most widespread organic pollutants. In addition to their presence in fossil fuels they are also formed by incomplete [[combustion]] of [[carbon]]-containing fuels such as [[wood]], [[coal]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[fat]], [[tobacco]], and [[incense]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Incense link to cancer |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2001-08-02 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1467409.stm}}</ref> Different types of combustion yield different distributions of PAHs in both relative amounts of individual PAHs and in which [[isomer]]s are produced. Thus, coal burning produces a different mixture than motor-fuel combustion or a forest fire, making the compounds potentially useful as indicators of the burning history. Hydrocarbon emissions from fossil fuel-burning engines are regulated in developed countries.<ref>For example, EPA regulations for small engines are at 40 CFR §90.103; see [[emission standard]] for more information.</ref>

==List of PAHs==
Although the health effects of individual PAHs are not exactly alike, the following 18 PAHs are considered as a group in this profile issued by the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR):<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ ATSDR]</ref>

==Human health==
The toxicity of PAHs is structure-dependent. Isomers (PAHs with the same formula and number of rings) can vary from being nontoxic to extremely toxic. One PAH compound, [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], is notable for being the first chemical carcinogen to be discovered (and is one of many carcinogens found in [[Chemicals in a cigarette|cigarette smoke]]). The EPA has classified seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: [[benz(a)anthracene|benz[''a'']anthracene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']fluoranthene]], [[chrysene]], [[dibenz(a,h)anthracene]], and [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]].

PAHs known for their [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic and [[teratogen]]ic properties are [[benzo(a)anthracene|benz[''a'']anthracene]] and [[chrysene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(j)fluoranthene|benzo[''j'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[benzo(ghi)perylene|benzo[''ghi'']perylene]], [[coronene]], [[dibenz(a,h)anthracene]] ({{chem|C|20|H|14}}), [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]] ({{chem|C|22|H|12}}) and [[ovalene]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Luch, A.|year=2005|title=The Carcinogenic Effects of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons|place=London|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-417-5}}</ref>

High prenatal exposure to PAH is associated with lower IQ and childhood asthma.<ref>[http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2009/07/20/exposure-to-common-pollutant-in-womb-might-lower-iq.html Exposure to Common Pollutant in Womb Might Lower IQ]</ref>   The Center for Children's Environmental Health reports studies that demonstrate that exposure to PAH pollution during pregnancy is related to adverse birth outcomes including low birth weight, premature delivery, and heart malformations.  Cord blood of exposed babies shows DNA damage that has been linked to cancer.  Follow-up studies show a higher level of developmental delays at age three, lower scores on IQ tests and increased behaviorial problems at ages six and eight.<ref>
http://www.ccceh.org/pdf-press/Time10-4-10.pdf</ref>

In addition, a 2012 [[Columbia University]] study in ''[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]'' linked prenatal exposure to pollutants and eventual child behavioral outcomes. The study found that exposure to higher levels of PAH was associated with a 24% higher score of anxiety/depression for children ages 6 to 7 than those with low exposure levels. Infants found to have elevated PAH levels in their umbilical cord blood were 46% more likely to eventually score highly on the anxiety/depression scale than those with low PAH levels in cord blood.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/prenatal-pah-exposure-child-behavior-problems/ | title=Prenatal Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) Exposure and Child Behavior at Age 6-7}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved 4 April 2012</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 =Perera | first1 = Frederica P. | last2 = Tang | first2 = Deliang | last3 = Wang | first3 = Shuang  | last4 = Vishnevetsky | first4 = Julia | year = 2012 | title = Prenatal Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) Exposure and Child Behavior at age 6-7 | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | doi = 10.1289/ehp.1104315}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
The simplest PAHs, as defined by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) (G.P Moss, IUPAC nomenclature for fused-ring systems), are [[phenanthrene]] and [[anthracene]], which both contain three fused aromatic rings. Smaller molecules, such as [[benzene]], are not PAHs.

PAHs may contain four-, five-, six- or seven-member rings, but those with five or six are most common. PAHs composed only of six-membered rings are called '''alternant''' PAHs. Certain alternant PAHs are called '''benzenoid''' PAHs. The name comes from [[benzene]], an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] with a single, six-membered ring. These can be benzene rings interconnected with each other by single carbon-carbon bonds and with no rings remaining that do not contain a complete benzene ring. The set of alternant PAHs is closely related to a set of mathematical entities called [[polyhex (mathematics)|polyhex]]es, which are planar figures composed by conjoining regular [[hexagon]]s of identical size.

PAHs containing up to six fused aromatic rings are often known as "small" PAHs, and those containing more than six aromatic rings are called "large" PAHs. Due to the availability of samples of the various small PAHs, the bulk of research on PAHs has been of those of up to six rings. The biological activity and occurrence of the large PAHs does appear to be a continuation of the small PAHs. They are found as combustion products, but at lower levels than the small PAHs due to the kinetic limitation of their production through addition of successive rings. In addition, with many more isomers possible for larger PAHs, the occurrence of specific structures is much smaller.

PAHs possess very characteristic [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|UV absorbance spectra]]. These often possess many absorbance bands and are unique for each ring structure. Thus, for a set of [[isomer]]s, each isomer has a different UV absorbance spectrum than the others. This is particularly useful in the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also [[fluorescent]], emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). The extended pi-electron electronic structures of PAHs lead to these spectra, as well as to certain large PAHs also exhibiting [[semiconductor|semi-conducting]] and other behaviors.

[[Naphthalene]] (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, a constituent of some [[mothball]]s), consisting of two coplanar six-membered rings sharing an edge, is another aromatic hydrocarbon. By formal convention, it is not a true PAH, though is referred to as a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

Aqueous solubility decreases approximately one order of magnitude for each additional ring.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has designated 32 PAH compounds as priority pollutants. The original 16 are listed. They are [[naphthalene]], [[acenaphthylene]], [[acenaphthene]], [[fluorene]], [[phenanthrene]], [[anthracene]], [[fluoranthene]], [[pyrene]], [[benzo(a)anthracene|benzo[''a'']anthracene]], [[chrysene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']flouranthene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[dibenz(ah)anthracene]], [[benzo(ghi)perylene|benzo[''ghi'']perylene]], and [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]]. This list of the 16 EPA priority PAHs is often targeted for measurement in environmental samples.

==Aromaticity==
Although PAHs clearly are aromatic compounds, the degree of [[aromaticity]] can be different for each ring segment. According to '''Clar's rule''' (formulated by Erich Clar in 1964)<ref>{{cite book |author=Clar, E. (Erich) |year=1964 |title=Polycyclic Hydrocarbons |place=New York |publisher=[[Academic Press]]. [http://lccn.loc.gov/63012392 LCCN 63012392]}}</ref> for PAHs the [[resonance structure]] with the most disjoint aromatic п-sextets—i.e. benzene-like moieties—is the most important for the characterization of the properties.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/poc.938|title=Assessment of Clar's aromatic π-sextet rule by means of PDI, NICS and HOMA indicators of local aromaticity|year=2005|last1=Portella|first1=Guillem|last2=Poater|first2=Jordi|last3=Solà|first3=Miquel|journal=Journal of Physical Organic Chemistry|volume=18 |issue=8|pages=785}}</ref>

For example, in [[phenanthrene]] ('''1''') one Clar structure has two sextets at the extremities, while the other resonance structure has just one central sextet. Therefore in this molecule the outer rings are firmly aromatic while its central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive. In contrast, in [[anthracene]] ('''2''') the number of sextets is just one and aromaticity spreads out. This difference in number of sextets is reflected in the UV absorbance spectra of these two isomers. [[Phenanthrene]] has a highest wavelength absorbance around 290&nbsp;nm, while [[anthracene]] has highest wavelength bands around 380&nbsp;nm. Three Clar structures with two sextets are present in [[chrysene]] ('''3''') and by superposition the aromaticity in the outer ring is larger than in the inner rings. Another relevant Clar hydrocarbon is [[zethrene]].
