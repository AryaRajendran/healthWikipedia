==Background==
Born Denham Harman, he earned his BS and Ph.D. in 1943 from the College of Chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and his M.D. from [[Stanford University]], finishing his internship in 1954. 

Immediately after earning his Ph.D., in 1943, Harman joined the [[Chemical kinetics|reaction kinetics]] department of [[Shell Oil]] in Emeryville, [[California]]. He worked for six years as a Shell research [[chemist]], in part studying [[radical (chemistry)|free radical reactions]] in petroleum products. During that period he was granted 35 [[patent]]s, one for a compound used in plastic strips to kill [[fly|flies]] ("Shell No Pest Strip"). 

Harman became fascinated with the phenomenon of [[ageing|aging]], its cause and possible cure. To assist him in understanding this problem,  he went to medical school at Stanford University. Harman became [[Chair (official)|chair]] of [[Cardiovascular_disease#Research|cardiovascular research]] at the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center|University of Nebraska College of Medicine]] in 1958. 

Harman has been married to the same woman for most of his life,  a [[journalism]] student whom he met at a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] dance while at the University of California. The couple has four children and four grandchildren. Harman maintained a healthy [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] throughout his life. He has never [[Tobacco smoking|smoked]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinks alcohol]] in moderation. He ran two miles a day until he was 82. He quit because of a back injury, but he continued to take regular walks to help him maintain a weight of 140 pounds on his 5-foot-10 frame.

==Development of the Free Radical Theory of Aging==
In 1954, between his [[medical intern|internship]] and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[internal medicine]], Harman became a research associate at the Donner Laboratory of [[Medical Physics]] at [[University of California|UC Berkeley]],<ref name="Hplus" /> where he was able to pursue the puzzle of the [[senescence|cause of aging]]. After four months of frustration he hit upon the idea of [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] as cause of the damage to macromolecules known as "[[ageing|aging]]". Although initially other scientists were reluctant to accept his theory, he was finally able to get it published in what is now a much-cited article in the Journal of Gerontology.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Harman, D | title=Aging: a theory based on free radical and radiation chemistry | journal=Journal of Gerontology | volume=11 | issue=3 | year=1956 | pages=298–300 | pmid=13332224 }}</ref>

Harman attempted to detect free radicals in association with the [[enzyme]] [[catalase]], but without success. He attempted to do [[Life expectancy|life span]] studies with short-lived strains of [[mouse|mice]] subject to [[radiation]] and given the radiation protection compound 2-MEA ([[Cysteamine|2-mercaptoethylamine]]), and was able to show a 30% increase in [[Life expectancy|average life expectancy]]. He was able to show extension of life expectancy with a number of [[antioxidant]]s.

In 1961, Harman published a study showing that the degree of [[polyunsaturated|polyunsaturation]] in fats had a dramatic effect on [[cancer]] rates in mice. The most highly [[Unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated dietary fats]] were found to be the most [[carcinogen]]ic.

In 1968 Harman published a dietary antioxidant study showing that the food preservative [[Butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]] fed over a lifetime to mice produced a 45% increase in life span. Harman became concerned that although many of his studies showed an increase in [[Life expectancy|average lifespan]] by antioxidants, none showed an increase in [[maximum life span]]. 

After years of frustration over his inability to increase maximum lifespan with antioxidant supplements, Harman came to the conclusion that [[mitochondria]] were producing as well as being damaged by free radicals, but that [[exogenous]] antioxidants don't enter the mitochondria. And that it is mitochondria that determine lifespan. He published his ideas on what he called the "[[Free_radical_theory#Mitochondrial_theory_of_aging|mitochondrial theory of aging]]" in the April 1972 issue of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.<ref name="Hplus" /><ref>{{cite journal | author=Harman, D | title=A biologic clock: the mitochondria? | journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume=20 | issue=4 | year=1972 | pages=145–147 | pmid=5016631 }}</ref>

==Organizational Accomplishments==
In 1969 Harman became concerned that few of those involved in [[gerontology]] were studying the [[biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing|aging]], and fewer still had a serious interest in discovering the cause of aging. In 1970 he became a founder of the [[American Aging Association]] (AGE) to create a society of scientists focused on aging research and advocacy of aging research.  In 1985 he became a founder of the <!--Keep the following red link!
