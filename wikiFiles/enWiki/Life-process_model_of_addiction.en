The '''life-process model of addiction''' is the view that [[Substance dependence|addiction]] is not a [[disease]] but rather a [[habit (psychology)|habitual]] response and a source of gratification and security that can be understood only in the context of [[society|social relationship]]s and experiences.

This model of addiction is in direct opposition to the [[disease model of addiction]]. The proponents of the life-process model argue that the [[biological process|biological mechanisms]] that might account for addictive [[behavior]] have not been identified and thus do not support using the term ''disease'', preferring to emphasize the individual's ability to overcome addiction by repairing relationships and personal strength of will.
