'''Lung abscess''' is [[necrosis]] of the [[pulmonary]] tissue and formation of cavities (more than 2&nbsp;cm)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bartlett JG, Finegold SM |title=Anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=413–50 |year=1972 |pmid=4564416 |doi=}}</ref> containing necrotic debris or fluid caused by [[microbial]] infection.

This pus-filled cavity is often caused by aspiration, which may occur during altered consciousness.  [[Alcoholism]] is the most common condition predisposing to lung abscesses.

Lung abscess is considered '''primary''' (60%<ref name="medscape">{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/534860 |title=Pneumonia and Other Pulmonary Infections: Lung Abscess, Medscape |accessdate=2007-06-20 |format= |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011102817/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/534860 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-11}}</ref>) when it results from existing lung [[parenchymal]] process and is termed '''secondary''' when it complicates another process e.g. [[Blood vessel|vascular]] [[emboli]] or follows rupture of [[extrapulmonary]] [[abscess]] into lung.

== Causes ==
;Conditions contributing to lung abscess
*Aspiration of [[oropharyngeal]] or [[gastric secretion]]
*Septic emboli
*[[Necrotizing]] [[pneumonia]]
*[[Vasculitis]]: [[Wegener's granulomatosis]]
*Necrotizing [[tumors]]: 8% to 18% are due to [[neoplasms]] across all age groups, higher in older people; primary [[squamous carcinoma]] of the lung is the most common.

;Organisms
In the post-antibiotic era pattern of frequency is changing. In older studies anaerobes were found in up to 90% cases but they are much less frequent now.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bartlett JG |title=The role of anaerobic bacteria in lung abscess |journal=Clin.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Onset of symptoms is often gradual, but in necrotizing staphylococcal or gram-negative bacillary pneumonias patients can be acutely ill. [[Cough]], fever with shivering and [[night sweats]] are often present. Cough can be productive with foul smelling [[purulent]] [[sputum]] (≈70%) or less frequently with blood (i.e. [[hemoptysis]] in one third cases).<ref name="Moreira">{{cite journal |author=Moreira Jda S, Camargo Jde J, Felicetti JC, Goldenfun PR, Moreira AL, Porto Nda S |title=Lung abscess: analysis of 252 consecutive cases diagnosed between 1968 and 2004 |journal=Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicaça̋o oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=136–43 |year=2006 |pmid=17273583 |doi=}}</ref> Affected individuals may also complain of chest pain, shortness of breath, [[lethargy]] and other features of chronic illness.

Patients are generally [[cachexia|cachectic]] at presentation. Finger [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] is present in one third of patients.<ref name="Moreira"/> Dental decay is common especially in alcoholics and children. On examination of chest there will be features of consolidation such as localized dullness on [[percussion]], [[Breath sounds|bronchial breath sound]] etc.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Abscess.jpg|thumb|Pathology image of a lung abscess.]]
;Chest Xray and other imaging studies
Abscess is often [[unilateral]] and single involving posterior segments of the upper lobes and the apical segments of the lower lobes as these areas are gravity dependent when lying down. Presence of air-fluid levels implies rupture into the [[bronchial tree]] or rarely growth of gas forming organism.
;Laboratory studies
Raised inflammatory markers (high [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]], [[C-reactive protein|CRP]]) are usual but not specific. Examination of sputum is important in any pulmonary infections and here often reveals mixed flora. [[Respiration (physiology)|Transtracheal]] of [[bronchus|Transbronchial]] (via bronchoscopy) aspirates can also be cultured. Fibre optic [[bronchoscopy]] is often performed to exclude obstructive lesion; it also helps in bronchial drainage of pus.

== Management ==
Broadspectrum [[antibiotic]] to cover mixed flora is the mainstay of treatment. Pulmonary physiotherapy and [[postural drainage]] are also important. Surgical procedures are required in selective patients for drainage or pulmonary resection.

== Complications ==
Rare nowadays but include spread of infection to other lung segments, [[bronchiectasis]], [[empyema]], and [[bacteraemia]] with [[metastasis|metastatic]] infection such as [[brain abscess]].<ref name="medscape"/>

== Prognosis ==
Most cases respond to antibiotic and prognosis is usually excellent unless there is a debilitating underlying condition. Mortality from lung abscess alone is around 5% and is improving.
