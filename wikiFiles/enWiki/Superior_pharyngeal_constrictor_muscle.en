The '''superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle''' is a muscle in the [[pharynx]]. It is the highest located muscle of the thee [[pharyngeal constrictor]]s. The muscle is a quadrilateral muscle, thinner and paler than the [[inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle]] and [[middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle]]. 

The muscle can divided into four parts: A pterygopharyngeal, buccopharyngeal, myolopharyngeal and a glossopharyngeal part.

== Origin and insertion ==
The four parts of this muscle arise from:<br />
- the lower third of the posterior margin of the [[medial pterygoid plate]] and its [[hamulus]] ('''Pterygopharyngeal part''')<br />
- from the [[pterygomandibular raphe]] ('''Buccopharyngeal part''')<br />
- from the [[alveolar process]] of the [[Human mandible|mandible]] above the posterior end of the [[mylohyoid line]] ('''Myolopharyngeal part''')<br />
- and by a few fibers from the side of the [[tongue]] ('''Glossopharyngeal part''')<br /> 

The fibers curve backward to be inserted into the [[Pharyngeal raphe|median raphe]], being also prolonged by means of an [[aponeurosis]] to the [[pharyngeal spine]] on the basilar part of the [[occipital bone]]. 

The superior fibers arch beneath the [[levator veli palatini]] muscle and the [[Eustachian tube]].

==Relations==
The interval between the upper border of the muscle and the [[base of the skull]] is closed by the [[pharyngeal aponeurosis]], and is known as the [[sinus of Morgagni]].

==Action==
As soon as the [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of food is received in the pharynx, the elevator muscles relax, the pharynx descends, and the constrictors contract upon the bolus, and convey it downward into the [[esophagus]].

==Innervation==
The superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle is innervated by the [[Pharyngeal branch of vagus nerve|pharyngeal branch]] of the [[vagus nerve]] via the [[pharyngeal plexus]].
