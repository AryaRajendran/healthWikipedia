'''Gerald B. Appel''' (born 1947) is an American physician and [[kidney]] researcher known both for his celebrity patients and for his scholarly work on the renal manifestations of [[systemic lupus erythematosis]].  He is also the world's foremost authority on diseases of the [[glomerulus]], having published more than one hundred academic papers on the subject.  Appel is currently Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Nephrology at [[Columbia University Medical Center]] in New York City, where he also runs the Center for Glomerular Diseases, the nation's largest institute for research into the treatment of intrinsic diseases of the kidney.  The [[National Kidney Foundation]] awarded Appel its lifetime achievement award in 2005, naming him "the foremost academic nephrologist of the past twenty-five years."<ref>''Kidney News'', Oct. 2005</ref> 

Appel gained widespread recognition during the early 2000s for his role in securing a kidney transplant for professional basketball player [[Alonzo Mourning]] and for enabling Mourning to return to the court for an NBA championship.<ref>Robertson, L.

Hardy.
