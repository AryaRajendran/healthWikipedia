The '''insulin-like growth factors''' (IGFs) are [[protein]]s with high [[Homology (biology)|sequence similarity]] to [[insulin]]. IGFs are part of a [[complex system]] that cells use to communicate with their [[physiology|physiologic]] environment. This complex system (often referred to as the IGF "axis") consists of two [[cell-surface receptor]]s (IGF1R and IGF2R), two [[ligand]]s ([[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) and [[ Insulin-like growth factor 2]] (IGF-2)), a family of six high-affinity [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein|IGF-binding proteins]] (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6), as well as associated [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein|IGFBP]] degrading [[enzyme]]s, referred to collectively as [[protease]]s.

== IGF1/GH Axis ==

The IGF "axis" is also commonly referred to as the Growth Hormone/IGF1 Axis. [[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) is mainly secreted by the liver as a result of stimulation by [[growth hormone]] (GH). IGF-1 is important for both the regulation of normal physiology, as well as a number of pathological states, including [[cancer]]. The IGF axis has been shown to play roles in the promotion of [[cell proliferation]] and the inhibition of [[cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]). [[Insulin-like growth factor 2]] (IGF-2) is thought to be a primary [[growth factor]] required for early development while [[IGF-1]] expression is required for achieving maximal growth. [[Gene knockout]] studies in mice have confirmed this, though other animals are likely to regulate the expression of these genes in distinct ways. While IGF-2 may be primarily [[fetus|fetal]] in action it is also essential for development and function of organs such as the [[brain]], [[liver]] and [[kidney]].

Factors that are known to cause variation in the levels of GH and IGF-1 in the circulation include an individuals genetic make-up, the time of day, their age, sex, exercise status, stress levels, genetics, nutrition level and [[body mass index]] (BMI), disease state, race, estrogen status and [[xenobiotic]] intake.

IGF-I has an involvement in regulating [[neural development]] including  [[neurogenesis]], [[myelination]], [[synaptogenesis]], and [[dendritic]] branching and [[neuroprotection]] after neuronal damage. Increased serum levels of IGF-I in children link to higher [[IQ]].<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Gunnell, David | last2 = Miller | first2 = LL | last3 = Rogers | first3 = I | last4 = Holly | first4 = JM | last5 = Alspac Study | first5 = Team | title = Association of Insulin-like Growth Factor I and Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein-3 with Intelligence Quotient Among 8- to 9-Year-Old Children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/116/5/e681 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 116 | issue = 5 | pages = e681 | date = 11/01/2005 | pmid = 16263982 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2004-2390 }}</ref>

IGF-1 shapes the development of the [[cochlea]] through controlling [[apoptosis]]. Its deficit can cause [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] loss. Serum level of it also underlies a correlation between short [[human height|height]] and reduced hearing abilities particularly around 3–5 years of age, and at age 18 (late [[puberty]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Welch | first1 = D | last2 = Dawes | first2 = PJ. | year = 2007 | title = Childhood hearing is associated with growth rates in infancy and adolescence | url = | journal = Pediatr Res | volume = 62 | issue = 4| pages = 495–8 | pmid = 17667854 | doi = 10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181425869 }}</ref>

==IGF receptors==

The IGFs are known to bind the [[IGF-1 receptor]], the [[insulin receptor]], the [[insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor|IGF-2 receptor]], the insulin-related receptor and possibly other receptors.  The [[IGF-1 receptor]] is the "physiological" receptor—[[IGF-1]] binds to it at significantly higher affinity than it binds the insulin receptor.  Like the insulin receptor, the IGF-1 receptor is a [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]—meaning the receptor signals by causing the addition of a phosphate molecule on particular tyrosines. The IGF-2 receptor only binds IGF-2 and acts as a "clearance receptor"—it activates no intracellular signaling pathways, functioning only as an IGF-2 sequestering agent and preventing IGF-2 signaling.

==Organs and tissues affected by IGF-1==

Since many distinct tissue types express the [[IGF-1 receptor]], IGF-1's effects are diverse.   It acts as a [[neurotrophic]] factor, inducing the survival of neurons.  It causes [[skeletal muscle]] [[hypertrophy]], by inducing [[protein synthesis]], and by blocking [[muscle atrophy]].  It is protective for [[cartilage]] cells, and is associated with activation of [[osteocytes]], and thus may be an anabolic factor for [[bone]].   Since at high concentrations it is capable of activating the [[insulin receptor]], it can also complement for the effects of [[insulin]].

== IGF-Binding Proteins ==

IGF-1 and IGF-2 are regulated by a family of proteins known as the [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein|IGF-Binding Proteins]].  These proteins help to modulate IGF action in complex ways that involve both inhibiting IGF action by preventing binding to the IGF-1 receptor as well as promoting IGF action possibly through aiding in delivery to the receptor and increasing IGF half-life.  Currently, there are six characterized IGF Binding Proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6).  There is currently significant data suggesting that IGFBPs play important roles in addition to their ability to regulate IGFs.

== Diseases affected by IGF ==

Studies of recent interest show that the Insulin/IGF axis play an important role in [[Senescence|aging]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Nematode]]s, [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit-flies]] and other organisms have an increased life span when the gene equivalent to the mammalian insulin is [[Gene knockout|knocked out]].  It is somewhat difficult to relate this finding to the mammal, however, because in the smaller organism there are many genes (at least 37 in the nematode<ref name="pmid11274053">

Simpler organisms typically have fewer receptors (only one known in the nematode){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and the roles of these other insulins are unknown.  Additionally, these animals do not have specialized organs ([[Islets of Langerhans]]), which sense insulin in response to glucose homeostasis. Moreover, IGF1 affects lifespan in nematodes by causing dauer formation, a developmental stage of C. elegans larva. There is no mammalian correlate. Therefore it is an open question as to whether either IGF-1 or insulin in the mammal may perturb aging, although there is the suggestion that dietary restriction phenomena may be related.

Other studies are beginning to uncover the important role the IGFs play in diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]], showing for instance that IGF-1 stimulates growth of both prostate and breast cancer cells.  Researchers are not in complete agreement about the degree of cancer risk that IGF-1 poses.<ref name="pmid1713219">
