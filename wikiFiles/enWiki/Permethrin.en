'''Permethrin''' is a common [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] chemical, widely used as an [[insecticide]], [[acaricide]], and [[insect repellent]]. It belongs to the family of synthetic chemicals called [[pyrethroid]]s and functions as a [[neurotoxin]], affecting [[neuron]] [[cell membrane|membrane]]s by prolonging sodium channel activation. It is not known to rapidly harm most [[mammal]]s or [[bird]]s, but is dangerously toxic to [[cat]]s<ref>{{cite web |publisher=ASPCA National Animal Poison Control Center |title=Permethrin Hazards For Cats |url=http://www.vetprof.com/clientinfo/permethrincats.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=About.com |title=Cat Flea Control Products Warning |author=Franny Syufy |url=http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/a/permethrin.htm}}</ref> and [[fish]]. In general, it has a low mammalian toxicity and is poorly absorbed by skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/metiram-propoxur/permethrin-ext.html |title=Permethrin |publisher=Pmep.cce.cornell.edu |date=16 April 1986 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

In medicine, permethrin is a first-line treatment for [[scabies]]; a 5% (w/w) cream is marketed by [[Johnson & Johnson]] under the name '''Lyclear.''' In [[Nordic countries]] and [[Canada]], it is marketed under trade name '''Nix''', often available over the counter.

==Uses==
Permethrin is used:
* as an insecticide
** in agriculture, to protect crops
** in agriculture, to kill livestock parasites
** for industrial/domestic insect control
* as an insect repellent or insect screen
** in timber treatment
** as a personal protective measure (cloth impregnant, used primarily for US military uniforms and mosquito nets)
** in pet flea preventative collars or treatment.

=== Pest control ===
In agriculture, permethrin is mainly used on [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[maize]], and [[alfalfa]] crops. Its use is controversial because, as a [[broad-spectrum]] chemical, it kills indiscriminately; as well as the intended pests, it can harm beneficial insects including [[honey bee]]s, and aquatic life.<ref>{{cite journal | author = R. H. Ian | title = Aquatic organisms and pyrethroids | year = 1989 | journal = [[Pesticide Science]] | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–457 | doi = 10.1002/ps.2780270408}}</ref>

Permethrin kills ticks on contact with treated clothing. A method of reducing deer tick populations by treating rodent vectors involves stuffing biodegradable cardboard tubes with permethrin-treated cotton. Mice collect the cotton for lining their nests. Permethrin on the cotton instantly kills any immature ticks that are feeding on the mice. It is important to put the tubes where mice will find them, such as in dense, dark brush, or at the base of a log; mice are unlikely to gather cotton from an open lawn.

Permethrin is used in tropical areas to prevent [[mosquito]]-borne disease such as [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]]. [[Mosquito nets]] used to cover beds may be treated with a solution of permethrin. This increases the effectiveness of the bed net by killing parasitic insects before they are able to find gaps or holes in the net. Military personnel training in malaria-endemic areas may be instructed to treat their uniforms with permethrin, as well. An application should last several washes.

===Personal healthcare ===
Permethrin is used on humans to eradicate parasites such as [[head lice]], mites responsible for [[scabies]] and pest repellent clothing treatment; the common prescription is Permethrin with 5% concentration for scabies, and OTC (over-the-counter) treatment for head lice/crabs is usually permethrin with 1% concentration. Pharmaceutical grade permethrin 99% is differentiated from pesticide grade 94% by a higher purity, well specified impurities and lower content of the toxic CIS component at 25% as opposed to 40% in the pesticide grade. It is offered commercially by companies like [[VAV Life Sciences]], Dow Chemicals etc. and used extensively by agencies working in forest areas such as the US Army.<ref>[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/PHC%20Resource%20Library/PermethrinFTUFSMar10.pdf Permethrin Factory-Treated Flame Resistant ACU’s: U.S. Army Public Health Command]</ref>

Permethrin is also used in industrial and domestic settings to control pests such as [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. It may be incorporated in formulations of wood preservative <ref>[http://www.birdbrand.co.uk/acatalog/Wood_Preservatives.html See entry for Complete Wood Preservative]</ref>

===Military use===
In order to better protect soldiers from the risk and annoyance of biting insects, the US Army is fielding uniforms factory treated with permethrin.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/88171/Army_s_new_ACUs_combat_insect_borne_diseases/ Insect-repelling ACUs now available to all Soldiers], United States Army</ref>

==Stereochemistry==
Permethrin has four [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] (two [[enantiomer|enantiomeric pairs]]), arising from the two [[stereocenter|stereocentres]] in the [[cyclopropane]] ring. The ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' enantiomeric pair is known as '''transpermethrin'''.

</gallery>

==Toxicology and safety==
Permethrin acts as a [[neurotoxin]], slowing down the [[nervous system]] through [[Neural binding|binding]] to [[sodium channel]]s. This action is negatively correlated to [[temperature]], thus, in general, showing more acute effects on [[wikt:cold-blooded|cold-blooded]] animals (insects, fish, frogs...) over [[warm-blooded]] animals ([[mammal]]s and birds):
* Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and aquatic life in general, so extreme care must be taken when using products containing permethrin near water sources.
* Permethrin is also highly [[toxic]] to cats, and flea and tick-repellent formulas intended and labeled for (the more resistant) dogs may contain permethrin and cause feline permethrin [[toxic]]osis in cats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/7088397.stm |title=report "Cats 'killed by flea treatment'" |publisher=BBC News |date=10 November 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>
* Very high [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]]s will have tangible [[neurotoxic]] effects on [[mammal]]s and birds, including human beings.

Due to high toxicity for aquatic life, permethrin and permethrin-contaminated water should be properly disposed of. [[Chemical decomposition|Degradation]] is quick and should the chemical be disposed of far from any aquatic life, the negative effects would be minimized. In a non-industrial context, the [[contaminant]] may be placed in direct sunlight to induce [[photodegradation]]. Contaminated water exposed to direct sunlight will be cleared of the permethrin and any known pollutant [[subproduct]]s after a few hours.

===Human exposure===
According to the [[Connecticut Department of Public Health]], permethrin "has low mammalian toxicity, is poorly absorbed through the skin and is rapidly inactivated by the body. Skin reactions have been uncommon."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dph.state.ct.us/BCH/infectiousdise/tickborne/tick.htm#Permethrin | title = Tick Bite Prevention | author = Kirby C. Stafford III | date = February 1999 | publisher = Connecticut Department of Public Health}}</ref>

Excessive exposure to permethrin can cause [[nausea]], headache, muscle weakness, excessive [[salivation]], shortness of breath, and [[seizure]]s. Worker exposure to the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the [[urinary]] [[metabolite]]s, while severe [[Drug overdose|overdosage]] may be confirmed by measurement of permethrin in [[Blood serum|serum]] or [[blood plasma]].<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1215-1216.</ref>

Permethrin does not present any notable [[genotoxicity]] or [[immunotoxicity]] in humans and farm animals, but is classified by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) as a likely human [[carcinogen]], based on reproducible studies in which mice fed permethrin developed liver and lung [[tumor]]s.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/permethrin_fs.htm Permethrin Facts], US EPA, June 2006.</ref> Carcinogenic action in [[Human nose|nasal]] [[mucosal]] cells due to [[inhalation]] exposure is suspected, due to observed genotoxicity in human tissue samples, and in rat livers the evidence of increased [[pre-neoplastic]] [[lesion]]s raises concern over [[oral administration|oral]] exposure.<ref>{{cite journal | author = M.

Studies by Bloomquist et al., 2002<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12428726] Neurotoxicology. 2002 Oct;23(4-5):537-44.</ref> suggested a link of permethrin exposure to [[Parkinson's disease]], including very small (per kg.) exposures:
: ''2002 study'' - "Our studies have documented low-dose effects of permethrin, doses below one-one thousandth of a [[lethal dose]] for a mouse, with effects on those [[brain pathway]]s [that are] involved in Parkinson's Disease [...] We have found effects consistent with a pre-parkinsonsian condition, but not yet full-blown [[parkinsonism]]."&nbsp;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2881431.stm] BBC News, March 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.cals.vt.edu/news/archives/20030324.html] Virginia Tech, March 2003.</ref>

However a more recent 2007 study by the same researcher concluded that there was "little hazard to humans"
: ''2007 study'' - "long-term, low-dose exposure to permethrin alone did not cause signs of neurotoxicity to [[striatal]] [[dopaminergic]] [[neural]] terminals, or enhance the effects of [[MPTP]]. We conclude that, under typical use conditions, permethrin poses little Parkinsonian hazard to humans, including when impregnated into clothing for control of biting flies"<ref>
