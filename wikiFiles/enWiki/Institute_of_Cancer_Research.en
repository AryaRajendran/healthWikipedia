'''The Institute of Cancer Research''' (the '''ICR''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[research institute]] and [[university]] located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] specialised in [[oncology]], and a constituent college of the [[University of London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lon.ac.uk/colleges_institutes |title=University of London: Colleges/Institutes |publisher=Lon.ac.uk |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> It was founded in 1909 as a research department of the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]] and joined the University of London in 2003.<ref name=2009review/> It has been responsible for a number of breakthrough discoveries, including that the basic cause of cancer is damage to [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/about_us/achievements/long_term_achievements/index.shtml|title=Long-term Achievements|accessdate=23 February 2011|publisher=Institute of Cancer Research}}</ref>

The ICR occupies two sites, one in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Central London]] and one in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], southwest London, and had a total income of £85.4 million in 2010/11, of which £50.5 million was from research grants and contracts.<ref name="2011 annual account"/> The ICR provides both taught postgraduate degree programmes and research degrees and currently has around 340 students. Together with the Royal Marsden Hospital the ICR forms the largest comprehensive cancer centre in [[Europe]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/britains-best-hospitals-a-patients-guide-798352.html|title=Britain's best hospitals: A patients' guide|accessdate=20 October 2010|publisher=The Independent| date=20 March 2008}}</ref> and was ranked first amongst all British higher education institutions in the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' 2008 Research Assessment Exercise Table of Excellence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=404786|title=RAE 2008: The results|accessdate=20 October 2010|publisher=Times Higher Education| date=18 December 2008}}</ref> 

The ICR receives its external grant funding from the government body the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], from government research council bodies and from charities including the [[Wellcome Trust]], [[Cancer Research UK]], [[Breakthrough Breast Cancer]] and [[Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research]]. It also receives voluntary income from legacies and from public and corporate donations. It runs the Everyman Campaign fundraising appeal, which raises awareness of male cancers and funds research into testicular and prostate cancer at the Everyman Centre, which is based at the ICR.

== History ==

=== 1909 to 1970 ===

The ICR was founded in 1909, when a new laboratory building adjoining The Cancer Hospital (later named the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]]) was established with Dr Alexander Paine as its first Director.<ref name=2009review>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/about_us/annual_review/15136.pdf|title=Annual Review 2009|accessdate=21 October 2010|publisher=Institute of Cancer Research}}</ref> In 1910 Dr Robert Knox was appointed to head the Electrical and Radio-therapeutic Department at The Cancer Hospital and established the first professionally designed [[Radiology|X-ray Department]] for treatment and diagnosis in Britain. The Cancer Hospital Research Institute was officially opened by [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught]] in 1911. In 1921 Professor Archibald Leitch was appointed Director of The Cancer Hospital Research Institute. The Institute became a postgraduate School of the [[University of London]] in 1927.<ref name=2009review/> In 1931 [[Ernest Kennaway|Professor Sir Ernest Kennaway FRS]] became Director of the Institute. In 1932 a research team led by Professor Kennaway fractionated coal tar and isolated [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[a]pyrene]], which he identified as one of the chemical constituents that induced cancer in mice. These were the first research findings to show that a pure chemical substance can cause cancer. In 1936 Professor Kennaway proposed the potential of a link between [[smoking]] and [[lung cancer]]. The Cancer Hospital Research Institute moved to a new site on [[Fulham Road]] in Chelsea in 1939 and was renamed the Chester Beatty Research Institute. In 1946 Professor Sir Alexander Haddow FRS became the Director of the Chester Beatty Research Institute. In 1947, while conducting research at the Institute, Professor David Galton became the first physician in the world to use [[aminopterin]] (the forerunner of the [[methotrexate]] drug) in the treatment of adult [[leukaemia]], producing remission in some cancer patients.<ref name=2009review/>

During the 1940s Haddow established a Clinical Chemotherapy Research Unit - the first such unit in Europe - in partnership with the Royal Marsden Hospital and under Galton's leadership. The partnership was unique at the time in being able to take the drug discoveries directly into a partner hospital for clinical trials in cancer patients. The unit led to the Institute's discovery of three successful chemotherapy drugs in the 1950s: [[busulphan]] (Myleran), [[chlorambucil]] (Leukeran) and [[melphalan]] (Alkeran).<ref name=2009review/> 

In 1952 the ICR's Dr Eric Boyland had proposed that certain chemicals that cause cancer (carcinogens) react with [[DNA]] through an [[alkylation]] mechanism that damaged the DNA molecule. In follow-up research at the ICR in 1964, Professors Peter Brookes and [[Philip Lawley]] proved that chemical carcinogens act by damaging DNA, leading to mutations and the formation of tumours, proving that cancer is a genetic disease based on mutational events.<ref name=2009review/> 

In 1954 the Institute was officially renamed The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). The ICR established a second campus in Sutton, Surrey in 1956. Whilst working at the ICR in 1961, [[Jacques Miller|Professor Jacques Miller]] discovered the immunological role of the [[thymus]], as the repository of a special class of [[lymphocytes]] ([[T cells]]) essential for the mounting of an immune response.

=== 1970 to 2000===
Scientists at the ICR were instrumental in the development of one of the world's most widely used anti-cancer drugs, [[carboplatin]] (Paraplatin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/business/88/8826bus1.html |title=Collaboration Yielded A New Class Of Cancer Drugs |publisher=Chemical and Engineering News  |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}</ref> Carboplatin’s development began in 1970 after scientists in the United States discovered that the platinum-based compound cisplatin was effective against many tumours – but had serious side-effects. A team of ICR and RMH scientists and clinicians including Professors Ken Harrap and Tom Connors, Dr Hilary Calvert and Hospital Consultant Dr Eve Wiltshaw recognised its potential but also the need for a less toxic alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieu.icr.ac.uk/about_us/history/history3.htm |title=Drug discoveries raise profile of cancer chemotherapy |publisher=The Institute of Cancer Research's Interactive Education Unit |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}</ref> In collaboration with the chemical and precious metal company [[Johnson Matthey plc]] the ICR scientists evaluated some 300 different platinum-containing molecules and developed a series of second-generation compounds, of which carboplatin was selected as the lead. The first clinical trial of carboplatin was carried out in 1981 and it was launched commercially as Parplatin (manufacturered by Bristol-Myers) in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/pmr-v30-i3-116-119.pdf |title=Scientific Symposium on Paraplatin |publisher=Platinum metals review |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}</ref> As of 2012 carboplatin is in use for a range of cancers including ovarian and lung. For the development of these platinum-based anticancer drugs the ICR, together with The Royal Marsden Hospital and [[Johnson Matthey|Johnson Matthey plc]], received the [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen’s Award for Technological Achievement]] in 1991.

During the 1980s ICR scientists including Professors Hilary Calvert, and Ken Harrap and Dr Ann Jackman developed [[raltitrexed]] (Tomudex) at the ICR, a drug active for the treatment of colon and other cancers. In 1983 research teams at the Chester Beatty Laboratory of the ICR led by Professors Chris Marshall FRS and Alan Hall FRS discovered [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|N-RAS]], one of the first human cancer transforming genes ([[oncogenes]]). Professor Alan Hall went on in 1992 to discover that the molecular mechanism for the motility behaviour of animal cells (cell to cell attachment and cell movement) is through control of cytoskeletal assembly by specific [[GTPase-activating protein|GTPase-proteins]], known as [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] and [[Rac (GTPase)|Rac]]. The discovery is of fundamental significance in cancer research since cell motility is a key feature of cancer cell behaviour during metastasis (the spread of tumours around the human body). 

In 1994 an ICR team led by Professor Michael Stratton discovered the gene BRCA2, which has been linked to breast cancer, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer.<ref>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/265/5181/2088</ref> Professor Ashworth’s team in the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at the ICR established the connection between mutations in the BRCA2 gene and the operation of DNA repair pathways in cancer cells. This later led to the development of a [[PARP inhibitor]] drug, [[olaparib]], which targets the DNA repair pathways of cancer cells. A Phase I trial of olaparib found in June 2009 that tumours shrank or stabilised for more than half of patients with [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] mutations <ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/361/2/123 |title=NEJM - Inhibition of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase in Tumors from BRCA Mutation Carriers |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0900212 |publisher=Content.nejm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> It is believed that the drug may also be useful in other patients whose cancer it is linked to an error in their DNA repair pathway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/press/press_archive/press_releases_2009/13445.shtml |title=New Drug Targeting Cancer Weakness Shows Great Promise |publisher=Icr.ac.uk |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> 

In 1999 the Chester Beatty Laboratory in Chelsea was redeveloped and extended to incorporate the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, which was opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH The Prince of Wales]] in 1999.<ref name=2009review/>

=== 2000 to present ===

In 2000 Professor Michael Stratton at the ICR initiated the [[Cancer Genome Project]], which was aimed at capitalizing on the knowledge from the Human Genome sequence to screen all human genes in cancer cells to identify those genes responsible for specific cancers. The project was established at the genome sequencing facilities of the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]] near Cambridge, of which Professor Stratton is now the Director. One of the first major achievements of the Cancer Genome Project has been the characterisation of the cancer gene BRAF in collaboration with ICR scientists Professors Chris Marshall and Richard Marais. The research by the ICR team, published in June 2002, revealed that damage to the BRAF gene could cause up to 70 per cent of melanoma skin cancers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/press/press_archive/press_releases_2009/12212.shtml |title=Scientists Unravel Crucial Skin Cancer Switch |publisher=Icr.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/abstract/S1535-6108(09)00074-9 |title=Cancer Cell - Oncogenic Braf Induces Melanocyte Senescence and Melanoma in Mice |publisher=Cell.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> This has been instrumental in speeding up the development of new drugs for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Since 2002 the ICR has been working to develop drugs that inhibit BRAF in melanoma and other cancers where the gene is defective.<ref>ICR website: http://www.icr.ac.uk/about_us/feature_articles/braf_inhibitors/index.shtml Retrieved 7 February 2011</ref> 

In the five years from 2004/05, the ICR developed on average two drug development candidates per year. Since 2006, it has licenced three novel series of anti-cancer drugs to major pharmaceutical companies: [[Hsp90]] inhibitors to [[Novartis]], [[AKT|PKB]] inhibitors to [[AstraZeneca]] and [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3Kinase]] inhibitors to [[Genentech]]. The PIl3Kinase inhibitor GDC-0941, licensed to Genentech by Piramed, is thought to have potential in a range of human cancers. In laboratory experiments, ICR scientists found that the drug reduced the growth of glioblastoma (the most common form of brain tumour), it decreased the growth of ovarian tumours and in other studies, it was active against cell lines derived from other human cancers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/press/press_archive/press_releases_2009/13521.shtml |title=New Drug Blocks Common Cancer Pathway |publisher=Icr.ac.uk |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref>

In March 2009, a key enzyme (LOX) involved in cancer spread, [[metastasis]], a process that causes 90% of all cancer patient deaths, was found at Stanford University by [http://www.erlerlab.org Dr Janine Erler] for breast cancer <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/press/press_archive/press_releases_2009/10425.shtml |title=Key Jigsaw Piece in Cancer Spread |publisher=Icr.ac.uk |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> and later confirmed to be involved in the spread of bowel cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/press/press_archive/press_releases_2011/16929.shtml |title=New Targeted Treatment Strategy Could Help Bowel Cancer Patients |publisher=Icr.ac.uk |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}</ref> Also in 2009, the Integrative Network Biology initiative (INBi) was founded and established by Prof [http://www.lindinglab.org Rune Linding] with the aim of performing quantitative systems and network biology studies of the metastatic process. As part of this initiative, the ICR also established core facilities in proteomics equipped with state-of-the-art mass spectrometers and in supercomputing to support research projects demanding computational systems biology. The core activities of INBi has now relocated to the Technical University of Denmark ([http://www.dtu.dk DTU]).

In conjunction with [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust]], the ICR tested a promising new prostate cancer drug called [[abiraterone]], which it discovered and developed.<ref>http://www.icr.ac.uk/press/press_archive/press_releases_2009/13049.shtml</ref> A randomised placebo-controlled Phase III trial reported in October 2010 that abiraterone could extend survival in some men with late stage prostate cancer.<ref>ESMO conference website http://www.esmo.org/events/milan-2010-congress/news/view.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=964&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=585&cHash=3d2ec25340 Retrieved on February 8, 2011</ref> The trial, funded by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies]], included 1,195 patients from 13 countries whose advanced prostate cancer had stopped responding to standard therapies. Abiraterone extended the average overall survival of patients from 10.9 months to 14.8 months compared to a placebo, without many of the unpleasant side-effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. The FDA in April 2011 approved the drug for sale in the US under the trade name Zytiga.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm253139.htm</ref>

==Sites==
{{sect-expand|date=January 2013}}
The ICR occupies two sites, one in Chelsea, Central London and one in Sutton,  southwest London.

== Research==

The ICR pursues its research focused into three main research themes: [[genetic epidemiology]], [[molecular pathology]], and therapeutic development. These areas of research are essential for the development of personalised cancer medicine.

Towards this aim, the ICR and The Royal Marsden are currently building a dedicated £17 million Centre for Molecular Pathology <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/support_us/appeals/mol_pathology/index.shtml |title=The Centre for Molecular Pathology
|publisher=Icr.ac.uk |accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> (CMP), which opened on the 20th November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/press/press_archive/press_releases_2012/23340.shtml  |title=The Centre for Molecular Pathology is opened
|publisher=Icr.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref> The centre will exploit the increasing availability of information about the genetic make-up of different cancer types, in order to design new "personalised" treatments that target cancers' specific molecular defects. The CMP also aims to develop molecular diagnostic techniques that will accurately predict who will benefit most from a treatment, ensuring a patient receives the optimum drug(s) for the best possible outcome. The CMP will build on the organisations' existing expertise in breast, prostate and paediatric cancers, while providing opportunities for new developments in other cancers such as gastrointestinal, renal, gynaecological, melanoma, head & neck cancers and sarcomas.

The organisation’s research direction is set out in the ICR Scientific Strategy 2010 - 2015, which aims to develop key research areas while enhancing partnership affiliations. Its four objectives are to maintain, develop and exploit the unique relationship with the Marsden; to ensure a balanced portfolio of basic and applied research; to develop treatment regimes to the genetic makeup of patient and tumour (personalised medicine) and to recruit, retain and motivate the best staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ac.uk/about_us/scientific_strategy/index.shtml |title=Scientific Strategy|publisher=Icr.ac.uk |accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref>

== Teaching ==
The ICR runs an MSc in Oncology programme, which is a modular course aimed primarily at Specialist Registrars in Clinical and Medical Oncology.<ref name="2011 annual account"/> The course has exit points at Certificate, Diploma and MSc degree level.<ref name="2011 annual account"/>
