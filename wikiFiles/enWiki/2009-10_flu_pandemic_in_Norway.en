{{See also|2009 swine flu outbreak by country}}
Norway experienced the initial phases of a new influenza pandemic in the spring of 2009. Initial cases were tourists returning from other affected areas. In the summer of 2009, local person-to-person infection within Norway established itself. Soon thereafter, the number of patients tested for swine flu exceeded capacity, and authorities recommended that only patients with severe symptoms be tested. The first death from swine flu was reported in early September. As of October 2009, Norway is notable among the Scandinavian countries for a high number of swine flu deaths - 29 deaths as of January 4, 2010. All 19 counties of Norway now have confirmed cases, and 5 of these have had deaths from swine flu. Only Svalbard has no cases of swine flu.  Norwegian authorities had a pre-existing pandemic flu vaccine agreement with the pharmaceutical industry, and when the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, about 10 million doses of new flu vaccine were ordered. The first widespread vaccination started in [[Bergen]] on October 22, with several hundred queuing up. The new flu has been given widespread media coverage. The Norwegian government publishes a regular tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of swine flu, but makes clear that this is a gross underestimation of the true number of swine flu cases.

A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed and many countries have recommended it be stockpiles so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans,the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid lost of life. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and commonly bird flu.

== Timeline overview ==
On April 25, 2009, the Norwegian Institute for Public Health increased their alertness as a result of reports of a severe influenza in [[Mexico]].<ref>http://www.vg.no/helse/artikkel.php?artid=542311</ref> Three days later, it was considered "highly likely" that the new flu would reach Norway within the next few weeks<ref>http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=542692</ref> and the first confirmed cases came on May 9, 2009. The initial suspected and confirmed cases were tourists returning from affected areas.<ref>http://www.vg.no/helse/svineinfluensa/artikkel.php?artid=542742</ref> During the summer of 2009, local spread was established.

On May 9, 2009 the first confirmed cases were reported in two students from Oslo and Telemark returning from abroad.<ref>http://www.vg.no/helse/svineinfluensa/artikkel.php?artid=572553</ref> As of early July 2009, there were 42 confirmed cases of swine flu, 39 of which were infected while abroad.<ref>http://www.vg.no/helse/svineinfluensa/artikkel.php?artid=567832</ref> In late July 2009, a local outbreak was reported in a summer camp in Western Norway.<ref>http://www.vg.no/helse/svineinfluensa/artikkel.php?artid=564547</ref> The number of patients tested for suspected new flu increased beyond capacity, and by late July 2009 Norwegian authorities were recommending that only patients with severe symptoms were to be tested, as well as a few sentinel cases to confirm local spread.<ref>http://www.vg.no/helse/svineinfluensa/artikkel.php?artid=564976</ref>

== Influenza surveillance ==
The Norwegian government has operated an influenza surveillance system for many years. In this system, 201 selected general practices throughout the country report weekly on what percentage of their doctor contacts that are given the diagnosis of influenza-like illness. These practices cover about 15% of the population. The results of the influenza surveillance during the 2009 flu pandemic in Norway are shown in the figure below. The share of doctor contacts that ended in a diagnosis of influenza-like illness shot up to close to 10% in week 44. The last time this percentage was as high was in the 1999-2000 flu season.

On the basis of the last reported data as of November 4, 2009, the Norwegian Public Health Institute conclude that "the pandemic influenza virus is spreading epidemically in large parts of the country."<ref>http://www.fhi.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=233&trg=MainLeft_5565&MainArea_5661=5565:0:15,1214:1:0:0:::0:0&MainLeft_5565=5544:80997::1:5569:1:::0:0</ref>

== Scenarios ==

The probable scenario is that 30% of the population fall ill, after half a year; 15% of the population will be in ill and in bed. About half of the infected population is will become sick. This means that about 700,000 Norwegians will fall ill and that in this period an extra 700 – 3,000 deaths relative to the regular influenza season is expected.
 	
The worst case scenario would be that 50% of the population will fall ill within a half a year, 25% of the population will be ill and in bed. This means that 1.2 million Norwegians will fall ill in this period and that in this period an extra 5,000 – 13,000 deaths relative to the regular [[Flu season|influenza season is expected]].
 	
If 30% of the population becomes infected and 15% of the population falls ill in half a year, about 4-5% of these will be ill and in bed as the epidemic is on its worst. If 50% of the population becomes infected; and 25% falls ill and becomes ill and in bed, about 8% of these will be sick and in bed when the pandemic is at its worst. These numbers are estimated as an average nationwide, and that there might be great geographical differences, and in some areas a much greater amount of people might be ill at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=542579 |title=13.000 døde av svineinfluensa - VG Nett om Svineinfluensa |publisher=Vg.no |date= |accessdate=2009-04-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090430133547/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=542579| archivedate= 30 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="regjeringen.no">http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/kilde/hod/pla/2006/0001/ddd/pdfv/273635-beredskapsplan_pandemi.pdf</ref>

== Preparations ==
Norway has a stockpile of 1.4 million doses of [[Tamiflu]], and has ordered 200,000 doses of [[Relenza]].

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) announced{{when|date=December 2010}} that it would be only a matter of time before the virus was being transmitted within Norway and that cases of travelers falling ill would be expected the next weeks.  The main goals would be to reduce the spread of the virus in Norway as soon as it started.  Even so, closure of public institutions such as schools and kindergartens was to be avoided as long as possible.<ref name="fhi.no">http://www.fhi.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=233&trg=MainLeft_5799&MainArea_5661=5799:0:15,5008:1:0:0:::0:0&MainLeft_5799=5544:76458::1:5800:1:::0:0</ref>

As of May 15, the Norwegian government lifted the advice not to travel to Mexico.  Even so, people with increased risk of complications with the influenza are still advised to consider the need to travel.<ref>http://www.pandemi.no/pandemi/aktuelt/frar_der_ikke_lenger_mexico_reiser_401154</ref>

In early May Norway pre-ordered 4.7 million doses of the not-yet-developed ''Swine Influenza vaccine''; the price was estimated to be $47.5 million.<ref name="vg.no">http://www.vg.no/nyheter/svineinfluensa/artikkel.php?artid=543222</ref><ref>http://www.pandemi.no/pandemi/aktuelt/innkj_p_av_prepandemivaksine_mot_ny_influensa_a__h1n1__401514</ref>  In that connection Health Care Minister Bjarne Håkon Hanssen said:

<blockquote>

''The contract we are entering into will make it possible to secure vaccine for the population before a pandemic is declared. For myself and for the government it is important to follow up on the advice from the Pandemic Committee....  This is also in line with professional advice from the Health institutions.'' )<ref name="vg.no" />
	
</blockquote>

=== Vaccine ===

As of the fall of 2009, Norway will be supplied with 9,4 million dosages of the pandemic vaccine ([[GlaxoSmithKline]]). This means that every Norwegian can be given up to two dosages of the vaccine. The vaccine was intended to be ready for use, after clinical trials, in November/December.  Because swine influenza still was considered to be a mild disease, the pandemic vaccine would not be taken into use before approval by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA).

==== Distribution ====
Norway will have enough vaccine for everyone by fall 2009, however it might still be necessary to give early vaccinations to certain people, depending on H1N1/09 pandemic development in the winter season in the southern hemisphere. The main targets for early vaccinations are health personnel and people with increased risk of complications, with the Health Care Ministry giving recommendations about which groups should be prioritized.

Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) updates their homepage with information about the swine flu outbreak in Norway every day at 10:00 ([[UTC]]).<ref name="fhi.no" /> FHI believe that the [[northern hemisphere]] will not be greatly affected by the virus, with the exception of a few outbreaks in enclosed places (schools and other institutions, cruise ships), followed by a bigger epidemic in the fall or winter. Still the a lower probability that the first wave will strike Norway as early as this summer, just like the United States are experiencing right now. It is not yet certain how many Norwegians will fall ill even though a few estimates have been made.<ref>http://www.fhi.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=233&trg=MainLeft_6129&MainArea_5661=6129:0:15,5008:1:0:0:::0:0&MainLeft_6129=5544:76879::1:6130:1:::0:0</ref>

This means the trip home to Norway will be delayed, and that he will have to spend at least ten days in isolation. This case is however not reported as a Norwegian case of swine influenza, but a German one.<ref>http://www.vg.no/nyheter/svineinfluensa/artikkel.php?artid=543784</ref>
