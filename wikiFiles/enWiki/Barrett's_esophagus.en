'''Barrett esophagus''' ([[American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#Simplification_of_ae_and_oe|British English]]: '''Barrett's oesophagus'''), sometimes called '''Barrett syndrome''' or '''columnar epithelium lined lower oesophagus''' ('''CELLO'''), refers to an abnormal change ([[metaplasia]]) in the cells of the lower portion of the [[esophagus]]. When the normal [[squamous epithelium]] lining of the esophagus is replaced by [[goblet cells]] (cells usually found lower in the gastrointestinal tract), Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed. The medical significance of Barrett esophagus is its strong association with esophageal [[adenocarcinoma]], a particularly lethal cancer. 

The main cause of Barrett esophagus is thought to be an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from [[reflux esophagitis]].<ref name=Stein_1993>{{cite journal |author=Stein H, Siewert J |title=Barrett's esophagus: pathogenesis, epidemiology, functional abnormalities, malignant degeneration, and surgical management |journal=Dysphagia |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=276–88 |year=1993 |pmid=8359051 |doi=10.1007/BF01354551}}</ref>  In the last 4 years, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been increasing in the Western world. Barrett esophagus is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn ([[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], GERD), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett esophagus do not have symptoms.<ref name="pmid19269522"/> It is considered to be a [[premalignant condition]] because it is associated with an increased risk of [[esophageal cancer]] (more specifically, adenocarcinoma) of about 0.5% per patient-year.

Diagnosis of Barrett esophagus requires [[endoscopy]] (more specifically, [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]], a procedure in which a fibre optic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and [[duodenum]]) and [[biopsy]]. The cells of Barrett esophagus, after biopsy, are classified into four general categories: non-dysplastic, low-grade [[dysplasia]], high-grade dysplasia, and frank [[carcinoma]].  High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma can be treated by endoscopic resection and new endoscopic therapies such as [[radiofrequency ablation]], whereas advanced stages (submucosal)are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment.  Non-dysplastic and low-grade patients are generally advised to undergo annual observation with endoscopy, with radiofrequency ablation as a therapeutic option.  In high-grade dysplasia, the risk of developing cancer might be at 10% per patient-year or greater.<ref name="pmid19269522"/>

The condition is named after [[Norman Barrett]] (1903&ndash;1979) who described the condition in 1950.<ref name="Barrett">{{cite journal |author=BARRETT NR |title=Chronic peptic ulcer of the oesophagus and 'oesophagitis' |journal=Br J Surg |volume=38 |issue=150 |pages=175–82 |year=1950 |month=October |pmid=14791960 |doi= 10.1002/bjs.18003815005|url=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The change from normal to premalignant cells that indicate Barrett esophagus does not cause any particular symptoms. Barrett esophagus, however, is associated with the following symptoms:

* frequent and longstanding [[heartburn]]
* trouble swallowing ([[dysphagia]])
* vomiting blood ([[hematemesis]])
* pain under the breastbone where the esophagus meets the stomach
* unintentional weight loss because eating is painful

The risk of developing Barrett esophagus is increased by central (vs. peripheral) obesity.<ref name="Edelstein">{{cite journal |author=Edelstein ZR, Farrow DC, Bronner MP, Rosen SN, Vaughan TL |title=Central adiposity and risk of Barrett esophagus |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=403–11 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17681161 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2007.05.026 |url=}}</ref> The exact mechanism is unclear.

==Mechanism==
Barrett esophagus occurs due to chronic inflammation.  The principal cause of the chronic inflammation is [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], GERD (UK: GORD).  In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to the cells of the lower esophagus. Recently, it was shown that [[bile acids]] are able to induce intestinal differentiation, in gastroesophageal junction cells, through inhibition of the [[Epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) receptor and the [[protein kinase]] enzyme [[Akt]].<ref name="Gong">{{cite journal |author = Gong L, Debruyne PR, Witek M, Nielsen K, Snook A, Lin JE, Bombonati A, Palazzo J, Schulz S, Waldman SA |title = Bile acids initiate lineage-addicted gastroesophageal tumorigenesis by suppressing the EGF receptor-AKT axis |journal=Clin Transl Sci. |volume=2 |issue= 4|pages=286–93 |year= 2009 |pmid= 20443907 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-8062.2009.00131.x}}</ref> This results in the eventual up-regulation of the p50 subunit of protein complex [[NF-κB]] ([[NFKB1]]), and ultimately activation of the [[homeobox]] gene [[CDX2]], which is responsible for the expression of intestinal enzymes such as [[Guanylate cyclase 2C]].<ref name="Debruyne_2006">{{cite journal | author = Debruyne PR, Witek M, Gong L, Birbe R, Chervoneva I, Jin T, Domon-Cell C, Palazzo JP, Freund JN, Li P, Pitari GM, Schulz S, Waldman SA | title = Bile acids induce ectopic expression of intestinal guanylyl cyclase C through nuclear factor-kappaB and Cdx2 in human esophageal cells | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 130 | issue = 4 | pages = 1191–206 | year = 2006 | month = April | pmid = 16618413 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.12.032 | url = | issn = }}</ref> This mechanism also explains the selection of [[HER2/neu]] (also called ERBB2) and the overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis, and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with [[trastuzumab]] ([[Herceptin]]) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).

Researchers are unable to predict which heartburn sufferers will develop Barrett esophagus. While there is no relationship between the severity of heartburn and the development of Barrett esophagus, there is a relationship between chronic heartburn and the development of Barrett esophagus. Sometimes people with Barrett esophagus will have no heartburn symptoms at all. In rare cases, damage to the esophagus may be caused by swallowing a corrosive substance such as [[lye]].

==Diagnosis==

[[Image:Barretts esophagus alcian blue high mag.jpg|thumb|right|250px|High magnification micrograph of Barrett esophagus showing the characteristic [[goblet cell]]s. Alcian blue stain.]]
Both macroscopic (from endoscopy) and microscopic positive findings are required to make a diagnosis. Barrett esophagus is marked by the presence of [[columnar epithelia]] in the lower esophagus, replacing the normal [[squamous cell]] epithelium&mdash;an example of [[metaplasia]]. The secretory columnar epithelium may be more able to withstand the erosive action of the gastric secretions; however, this metaplasia confers an increased risk of [[adenocarcinoma]].<ref name=Fléjou_2005>{{cite journal |author=Fléjou J |title=Barrett's oesophagus: from metaplasia to dysplasia and cancer |journal=Gut |volume=54 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=i6–12 |year=2005 |pmid=15711008 |doi=10.1136/gut.2004.041525 |pmc=1867794}}</ref>

The presence of goblet cells, called intestinal metaplasia, is necessary to make a diagnosis of Barrett esophagus.  This frequently occurs in the presence of other metaplastic columnar cells but only the presence of goblet cells is diagnostic.

The metaplasia of Barrett esophagus is grossly visible through a [[gastroscope]], but biopsy specimens must be examined under a [[microscope]] to determine whether cells are gastric or colonic in nature. Colonic metaplasia is usually identified by finding [[goblet cells]] in the epithelium and is necessary for the true diagnosis of Barrett.

There are many histologic mimics of Barrett esophagus (i.e. goblet cells occurring in the transitional epithelium of normal esophageal submucosal gland ducts, "pseudogoblet cells" in which abundant foveolar (gastric) type mucin simulates the acid mucin true goblet cells).  Assessment of relationship to submucosal glands and transitional-type epithelium with examination of multiple levels through the tissue may allow the pathologist to reliably distinguish between goblet cells of submucosal gland ducts and true Barrett esophagus (specialized columnar metaplasia).  Use of the histochemical stain Alcian blue pH 2.5 is also frequently used to distinguish true intestinal-type mucins from their histologic mimics.  Recently, immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to CDX-2 (specific for mid and hindgut intestinal derivation) has also been utilized to identify true intestinal-type metaplastic cells. It has been shown that the protein [[AGR2]] is elevated in Barrett esophagus,<ref name="Pohler">{{cite journal |author = Elizabeth Pohler, Ashley L. Craig, James Cotton, Laura Lawrie, John F.

After the initial diagnosis of Barrett esophagus is rendered, affected persons undergo annual surveillance to detect changes that indicate higher risk to progression to cancer:  development of dysplasia.  There is considerable variability in assessment for dysplasia among pathologists.  Recently, gastroenterology and GI pathology societies have recommended that any diagnosis of high grade dysplasia in Barrett be confirmed by at least two fellowship trained GI pathologists prior to definitive treatment for patients.

==Management==
Many patients with Barrett's esophagus do not have dysplasia. Medical societies recommend that if a patient has Barrett's esophagus, and if the past two endoscopy and biopsy examinations have confirmed the absence of dysplasia, then the patient should not have another endoscopy within three years.<ref name="AGAfive">{{Citation |author1 =  American Gastroenterological Association |author1-link =  American Gastroenterological Association |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Gastroenterological Association]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AGA.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="barretts">{{cite PMID|21376940}}</ref><ref name="updatesbarretts">{{cite PMID|18341497}}</ref>

Many professional medical societies propose endoscopic [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] of patients with GERD and endoscopic surveillance of patients with Barrett esophagus, although little direct evidence supports this practice, which is common in many developed countries.<ref name="pmid19269522"/> Treatment options for high-grade dysplasia include surgical removal of the esophagus ([[esophagectomy]]) or endoscopic treatments such as [[endoscopic mucosal resection]] or ablation (destruction).<ref name="pmid19269522"/>

The risk of malignancy is highest in the U.S. in Caucasian men more than 50 years of age with more than 5 years of symptoms. Current recommendations include routine [[endoscopy]] and [[biopsy]] (looking for [[dysplastic change]]s). Although in the past physicians have taken a watchful waiting approach, newly published research supports consideration of intervention for Barrett's esophagus. [[Radiofrequency ablation]] is a new treatment modality for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia, and has been the subject of numerous published clinical trials.<ref name=Fleischer_2010>{{cite journal|author=Fleischer DE, Overholt, BF, Sharma VK, et al. |title=Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's esophagus: 5-year outcomes from a prospective multicenter trial |journal=Endoscopy |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=781–9 |year=2010 |pmid=20857372}}</ref><ref name=Shaheen_2010NEJM>{{cite journal|author=Shaheen NJ, Sharma, P, Overholt, BF, et al. |title=Radiofrequency Ablation in Barrett's Esophagus with Dysplasia |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=22 |pages=2277–88 |year=2009 |pmid=19474425}}</ref><ref name=Shaheen_Gastro2011>{{cite journal|author=Shaheen NJ, Overholt, BF, Sampliner, RE et al. |title=Durability of Ablation in Barrett's Esophagus with Dysplasia |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=460–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21679712}}</ref><ref name=Bergmangut_2011>{{cite journal|author=van Vilsteren FG, Pouw RE, Seewald, S et al. |title=Stepwise radical endoscopic resection versus radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's oesophagus with high grade dysplasia or early cancer: a multicentre randomised trial |journal=Gut |volume=60 |issue= 6 |pages=765–73 |pmid=21209124}}</ref> The findings demonstrate radiofrequency ablation has an efficacy of 80-90% or greater with respect to complete clearance of Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia with durability up to 5 years and a favorable safety profile.<ref name=Fleischer_2010/><ref name=Shaheen_2010NEJM/><ref name=Shaheen_Gastro2011/><ref name=Bergmangut_2011/>

Proton pump inhibitor drugs have not yet been proven to prevent esophageal cancer. [[Laser surgery#Medical|Laser treatment]] is used in severe dysplasia, while overt malignancy may require [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], or systemic [[chemotherapy]]. Additionally, a recent 5-year random-controlled trial has shown that [[photodynamic therapy]] using photofrin is statistically more effective in eliminating dysplastic growth areas than sole use of a proton pump inhibitor.<ref name=Overholt_2007>{{cite journal |author=Overholt BF, Wang KK, Burdick JS, et al. |title=Five-year efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy with Photofrin in Barrett high-grade dysplasia. |journal=Gastrointestinal endoscopy |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=460–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17643436 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2006.12.037}}</ref> There is presently no reliable way to determine which patients with Barrett esophagus will go on to develop [[esophageal cancer]], although a recent study found that the detection of three different genetic abnormalities were associated with as much as a 79% chance of developing cancer in 6 years.<ref name=Galipeau_2007>{{cite journal |author=Galipeau P, Li X, Blount  PL, Maley CC, Sanchez CA Odze RD, Ayub K, Rabinovitch PS, Vaughan TV, Reid BJ |title=NSAIDs modulate CDKN2A, TP53, and DNA content risk for progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e67 |year=2007 |pmid=17326708 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040067 |pmc=1808095}}</ref>
