'''Takayasu's disease''' (also known as "aortic arch syndrome", "nonspecific aortoarteritis" and the "pulseless disease"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|841}}) is a form of large vessel [[granulomatous]] [[vasculitis]]<ref name=mk>American College of Physicians (ACP). <u>Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program (MKSAP-15): Rheumatology</u>. "Systemic Vasculitis." Pg. 65–67. 2009, ACP. [http://mksap15.acponline.org/]</ref> with massive [[intima]]l [[fibrosis]] and vascular narrowing, affecting often young or middle-aged women of [[Asia]]n descent. It mainly affects the [[aorta]] (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and its branches, as well as the [[pulmonary arteries]]. Females are about 8–9 times more likely to be affected than males.<ref name=mk /><ref name=emedpedtakay>{{Emedicine|PED|1956|Takayasu Arteritis - Pediatrics}}</ref> Patients often notice the [[disease]] symptoms between 15 and 30 years of age. In the [[Western world]], [[atherosclerosis]] is a more frequent cause of obstruction of the aortic arch vessels than Takayasu's arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis is similar to other forms of vasculitis, including [[giant cell arteritis]].<ref name=mk />  Due to obstruction of the main branches of the aorta, including the left [[common carotid artery]], the [[brachiocephalic artery]], and the left [[subclavian artery]], Takayasu's arteritis can present as pulseless upper extremities (arms, hands, and wrists with weak or absent pulses on the physical examination) which may be why it is also commonly referred to as the "pulseless disease".

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Takayasu arteritis.JPG|thumb|Axial T1-weighted post-gadolinium MRI in a patient with Takayasu arteritis showing thickened, enhancing aortic wall, consistent with large vessel vasculitis]]
Although its [[etiology]] is unknown, the condition is characterized by segmental and patchy [[granuloma]]tous [[inflammation]] of the aorta and its major derivative branches. This inflammation leads to arterial [[stenosis]], [[thrombosis]], and [[aneurysm]]s.<ref name=emedpedtakay /> There is also irregular fibrosis of the blood vessels due to chronic vasculitis, leading to sometimes massive intimal fibrosis (fibrosis of the inner section of the blood vessels).<ref name=kaplan>John Barone, M.D. <u>USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes</u>. "Vascular Pathology." 2008, Kaplan Inc. pg 101.</ref> Prominent narrowing due to inflammation, granuloma, and fibrosis is often seen in arterial studies such as [[magnetic resonance angiography]] (MRA), [[computed tomography angiography]] (CTA), or arterial [[angiography]] (DSA).

==Symptoms==

Some patients develop an initial "inflammatory phase" characterized by systemic illness with [[symptom]]s of [[malaise]], [[fever]], [[sleep hyperhidrosis|night sweats]], [[weight loss]], [[arthralgia]], and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]. There is also often [[anemia]] and marked elevation of the [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] or [[C-reactive protein]] (nonspecific markers of inflammation). The initial "inflammatory phase" is often followed by a secondary "pulseless phase".<ref name=mk /> The "pulseless phase" is characterized by vascular insufficiency from intimal narrowing of the vessels manifesting as arm or leg [[claudication]], [[renal artery stenosis]] causing hypertension, and neurological manifestations due to decreased blood flow to the brain.<ref name=mk /> Of note is the function of renal artery stenosis in causation of high blood pressure: Normally perfused kidneys produce proportionate amount of a substance called [[renin]]. Stenosis of the renal arteries causes hypo-perfusion (decreased blood flow) of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]], resulting in exaggerated secretion of renin, and high blood levels of [[aldosterone]], eventually leading to water and salt retention and high blood pressure. The neurological symptoms of the disease vary depending on the degree, and the nature of the blood vessel obstruction and can range from lightheadedness, to seizures in severe cases. One rare but important feature of the Takayasu's arteritis is [[human eye|ocular]] involvement in form of visual field defects, vision loss, or retinal hemorrhage.<ref name=kaplan /><ref>{{cite journal|title=Ocular manifestations of the aortic arch syndrome (pulseless disease; Takayasu's disease) (Translated from French)|author=Milan B, Josip K.|date=November 1967| issue=11 | volume=200 | pmid=6079381|pages=1168–79|journal=Annales d'oculistique}}</ref> Some patients with Takayasu's arteritis may present with only late vascular changes, without an antecedent systemic illness. In the late stage, weakness of the arterial walls may give rise to localized [[aneurysm]]s. As with all aneurysms, possibility of rupture and vascular bleeding is existent and requires monitoring. [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is commonly found in this disease, mainly due to decreased circulation of the blood to the arms.

==Treatments==
The great majority of patients with Takayasu’s arteritis respond to [[steroids]] such as [[prednisone]]. The usual starting dose is approximately 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (for most people, this is approximately 60 milligrams a day). Because of the significant [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] of long-term high–dose prednisone use, the starting dose is tapered over several weeks to a dose that the [[physician]] feels is tolerable for the patient.

Surgical options may need to be explored for patients who do not respond to steroids.  Re-perfusion of tissue can be achieved by large vessel reconstructive surgery such as bypass grafting.  Grafting autologous tissue has the highest rates of success.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is not as effective in the long term but has fewer risks.

==History==
The first case of Takayasu’s arteritis was described in 1908 by Japanese [[ophthalmologist]] [[Mikito Takayasu]] at the Annual Meeting of the Japan Ophthalmology Society.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2722}}</ref><ref>M. Takayasu. A case with peculiar changes of the central retinal vessels. Acta Societatis ophthalmologicae Japonicae, Tokyo 1908, 12: 554.</ref> Takayasu described a peculiar "wreathlike" appearance of the [[blood vessel]]s in the back of the eye ([[retina]]). Two [[Japan]]ese physicians at the same meeting (Drs. Onishi and Kagoshima) also reported similar eye findings in patients whose [[Pulse|wrist pulse]]s were absent. It is now known that the blood vessel malformations that occur in the retina are an [[Angiogenesis|angiogenic]] response to the arterial narrowings in the neck, and that the absence of pulses noted in some patients occurs because of narrowings of the blood vessels to the arms. The eye findings described by Takayasu are rarely seen in patients from [[North America]] and British Columbia{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.
