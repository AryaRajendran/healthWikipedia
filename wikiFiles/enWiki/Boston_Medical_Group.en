Originally founded in [[Australia]], The company opened its first office in the United States in [[Costa Mesa, California]] in 1998. Currently, Boston Medical Group has twenty-one office locations across the [[United States]] in states including [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Michigan]], [[New York]], [[Colorado]] and [[Florida]] as well as over half a dozen additional offices in several other countries, including [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] and [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite news |work=[[El Norte (Monterrey)|El Norte]] |location=Monterrey, Mexico, Spain and Australia. |date=1998-07-14 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-1228053_ITM |title=Ofrecen la solucion a problemas masculinos |language=Spanish}}</ref>

==Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction, Premature Ejaculation & Hormone Therapy==

The office's primary treatment, called intracavernous pharmacotherapy (ICP), consists of administering an injection of a [[vasodilator]] drug by shoving a needle directly into the penis, which increases blood flow, and causes an erection in minutes in many patients.<ref>{{cite journal |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2002-07-08 |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/nightlife/sex/features/6204/index2.html |title=Where's Woody?}}</ref> 

ICP treatment has been used to help create and maintain erections in patients who do not respond to more mainstream medications or are prohibited from taking these drugs because of a heart condition, diabetes or blood pressure since ICP treatments are localized and do not typically interact with other systemic medications. 

Intracavernous pharmacotherapy can be used in patients with a wide variety of ailments wherein other medications might not be as effective. For example, a study showed that over seventy percent of patients with a spinal cord injury responded positively to intracavernous pharmacotherapy and were able to achieve an erection.<ref>[http://www.biomedsearch.com/nih/Vasoactive-intracavernous-pharmacotherapy-treatment-erectile/2442418.html Vasoactive intracavernous pharmacotherapy for the treatment of erectile impotence in men with spinal cord injury], from BioMedSearch</ref>

In addition to ICP, Boston Medical Group also offers treatments in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), specifically for low testosterone (Low T), a sublingual form of the well-known drug Viagra which is dissolved under the tongue and quickly enters the blood stream and a variety of treatment programs designed to specifically address low libido, ED, and premature ejaculation.

==Coverage in Media==

On April 7, 2011 the Los Angeles Times published an expose about Boston Male Medical Group's sales and compensation practices.  The article was titled "Clinic settles lawsuits but still faces scrutiny over erectile dysfunction injections" and subtitled "Boston Medical Group doctors get bonuses to promote the drug injections. Some patients say they suffered from priapism and permanent damage because they were not informed of the risks." <ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/07/local/la-me-boston-medical-20110404 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Alan | last=Zarembo | title=Clinic settles lawsuits but still faces scrutiny over erectile dysfunction injections | date=2011-04-07}}</ref>

==Competitors==
Boston Medical Group is often viewed as the first nationwide network of physicians dedicated to the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction since it was brought to the United States from Australia in 1998. Since then, many physicians have started their own practices based on similar practices and protocols developed by Boston Medical Group and the patented method of treatment they use known as the Boston Method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20090035221|title=US Patent for Erectile Dysfunction Treatment}}</ref>

==Legal Cases==

After admitting to not keeping proper records in 2001 and 2002, one doctor at an office location in Manhattan was placed on probation for five years by the New York state Health Department, and was no longer allowed to treat patients with erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation and other sexual problems.<ref name="NYPost">{{cite news |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2004-11-12 |url=http://moreresults.factiva.com/results/index/index.aspx?ref=NYPO000020041112e0bc0000e |title=Sex Doc in Rise and Fall - Bad Erection Injection}}</ref> 

John Henry Howard v. Boston Medical Group trial of September 2009 was successfully appealed in favor of Boston Medical Group and decided on July 12, 2011 by the Georgia Court of Appeals noting that proper instruction was ignored by the patient and that Boston Medical Group acted correctly to ensure proper patient care.<ref>[http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20GACO%2020110712221.xml&docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR John Henry Howard v.
