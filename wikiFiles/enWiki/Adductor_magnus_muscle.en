The '''adductor magnus''' is a large triangular muscle, situated on the [[ medial (disambiguation) | medial ]] side of the [[thigh]].

It consists of two parts. The portion which arises from the [[ischiopubic ramus]] (a small part of the [[inferior pubic ramus|inferior ramus of the pubis]], and the [[inferior ramus of the ischium]]) is called the adductor portion or [[adductor minimus]], and the portion arising from the [[tuberosity of the ischium]] is called the "hamstring portion". Due to its common embryonic origin, innervation, and action the hamstring portion is often considered part of the [[hamstring]] group of muscles.

== Origin and insertion ==

=== Adductor portion ===

Those fibers which arise from the ramus of the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] are short, horizontal in direction, and are inserted into the rough line of the [[femur]] leading from the [[greater trochanter]] to the [[linea aspera]], medial to the [[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]].

Those fibers from the ramus of the [[ischium]] are directed downward and laterally with different degrees of obliquity, to be inserted, by means of a broad [[aponeurosis]], into the linea aspera and the upper part of its medial prolongation below.

=== Hamstring portion ===

The medial portion of the muscle, composed principally of the fibers arising from the tuberosity of the ischium, forms a thick fleshy mass consisting of coarse bundles which descend almost vertically, and end about the lower third of the thigh in a rounded tendon which is inserted into the [[adductor tubercle of femur|adductor tubercle]] on the [[medial condyle of femur|medial condyle of the femur]], and is connected by a fibrous expansion to the line leading upward from the tubercle to the [[linea aspera]].

== Relations ==

By its anterior surface the adductor magnus is in relation with the [[pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[femoral artery]] and [[femoral vein|vein]], [[Profunda femoris artery|profunda artery]] and [[profunda femoris vein|vein]], with their branches, and with the posterior branches of the [[obturator artery]], [[obturator veins|obturator vein]] and [[obturator nerve]].

By its posterior surface with the [[semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], [[semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[biceps femoris muscle|biceps]], and [[gluteus maximus muscle]].

By its inner border with the [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]].

By its upper border with the [[obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]], and [[quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]].<ref>Wilson, Erasmus (1851) [http://books.google.com/books?id=t2M1AV1aYWQC&pg=PA261 ''The anatomist's vade mecum: a system of human anatomy''], p 261</ref>

== Innervation ==

The adductor and hamstring portions of the muscle are innervated by two different nerves. The adductor portion is innervated by the posterior division of the [[obturator nerve]] while the hamstring portion is innervated by the [[tibial nerve]].<ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|255|||}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rad.washington.edu/academics/academic-sections/msk/muscle-atlas/lower-body/adductor-magnus |title=Adductor Magnus| publisher=Department of Radiology, University of Washington |accessdate=2010-08-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100828111101/http://www.rad.washington.edu/academics/academic-sections/msk/muscle-atlas/lower-body/adductor-magnus| archivedate= 28 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

== Osseoaponeurotic openings ==
{{see|Adductor hiatus|Adductor canal}}

At the insertion of the muscle, there is a series of [[osseoaponeurotic]] openings, formed by tendinous arches attached to the bone. The upper four openings are small, and give passage to the [[perforating arteries|perforating branches]] of the [[profunda femoris artery]]. The lowest (often referred to as the [[adductor hiatus]]) is large, and transmits the [[femoral vessels]] to the [[popliteal fossa]].

== Action ==

The adductor magnus is a powerful [[Anatomical terms of motion|adductor]] of the [[thigh]], made especially active when the legs are moved from a wide spread position to one in which the legs parallel each other. The part attached to the ''[[linea aspera]]'' acts as a lateral rotator. The part which reaches the medial epicondyle acts as a medial rotator when the leg is rotated outwards and flexed, and also acts to extend the hip joint.<ref name="Platzer-242">Platzer, Werner (2004), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Bl8RO_Tq7zoC&pg=PA242" Color Atlas of Human Anatomy, Vol. 1, Locomotor System]'', Thieme, 5th ed, p 242</ref>

== Variation ==

The upper, lateral part of the adductor magnus is an incompletely separated division often considered a separate muscle&nbsp;— the [[adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]].<ref name="Platzer-242" /> These two muscles are frequently separated by a branch of the superior [[perforating artery|perforating branch]] of the [[profunda femoris artery]].<ref name="Bergman-etal">Bergman, Ronald A.; Afifi, Adel K.; Miyauchi, Ryosuke (2010), [http://www.anatomyatlases.org/AnatomicVariants/MuscularSystem/Text/A/27Adductor.shtml ''Adductor Minimus (Henle, Günther)''], Anatomy Atlases</ref>

== Ontogeny and phylogeny ==

In other [[tetrapods]], the adductor magnus crosses the knee joint and inserts into the tibia. In humans, the distal part of the tendon detaches and becomes the medial collateral ligament of the knee. Because of this, the medial collateral ligament of the knee in humans may contain a few muscle fibres as an atavistic variation.<ref>Norman Eizenberg et al., ''General Anatomy: Principles and Applications'' (2008), p 53.</ref>
