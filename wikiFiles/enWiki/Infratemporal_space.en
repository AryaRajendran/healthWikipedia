The '''Infratemporal space''' (also termed the '''infra-temporal space''' or the '''infra-temporal portion of the deep temporal space''')<ref name="Topazian 2002">{{cite book|last=Topazian RG, Goldberg MH, Hupp JR|title=Oral and maxillofacial infections|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0721692715|pages=188–213|edition=4. ed.}}</ref> is a [[fascial spaces of the head and neck|fascial space of the head and neck]] (sometimes also termed [[fascia]]l spaces or tissue spaces). It is a [[potential space]] in the side of the head, and is paired on either side. It is located posterior to the [[maxilla]], between the [[Pterygoid processes of the sphenoid|lateral pterygoid plate]] of the [[sphenoid bone]] medially and by the [[base of skull]] superiorly.<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=317–333|edition=5th}}</ref> The term is derived from ''[[wikt:infra-|infra-]]'' meaning below and ''temporal'' which refers to the [[temporalis muscle]].

The infratemporal space is the inferior portion of the [[deep temporal space]], which is one of the four [[compartment (anatomy)|compartment]]s of the [[masticator space]], along with the [[pterygomandibular space]], the [[submasseteric space]] and the [[superficial temporal space]].<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> The deep temporal space is separated from the pterygomandibular space by the [[lateral pterygoid muscle]] inferiorly and from the superficial temporal space by the temporalis muscle laterally. The deep temporal space and the superficial temporal space together make up the temporal spaces.<ref name="Hargreaves 2010">{{cite book|last=Hargreaves KM, Cohen S (editors), Berman LH (web editor)|title=Cohen's pathways of the pulp|year=2010|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-06489-7|pages=590–594|edition=10th}}</ref>

==Location and structure==

===Anatomic boundaries===

The boundaries of the infratemporal space are:<ref name="Mani 2008">{{cite book|last=Mani|first=K George Varghese, foreword by Varghese|title=A practical guide to hospital dentistry|year=2008|publisher=Jaypee Bros. Medical Pub|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788184482430|page=64}}</ref> 
* the greater wing of the sphenoid bone superiorly
* the pterygomandibular space inferiorly
* the infra-temporal surface of the maxilla anteriorly,
* the lateral pterygoid plate, part of the lateral pterygoid muscle and lateral pharyngeal wall medially

===Communications===
The communications of the infratemporal space are:<ref name="Mani 2008" /> 
* the pterygomandibular space inferiorly,
* the buccal space anteriorly and inferiorly,
* to the [[cavernous sinus]] via the [[pterygoid plexus]] of veins.

===Contents===
The contents of the infratemporal space are:<ref name="Hupp 2008" />
* branches of the [[maxillary artery]],
* the pterygoid venous plexus.

==Clinical relevance==
Infections of the infratemporal space are rare. They may be significant however, as it is possible for infection to spread via emissary veins from the pterygoid plexus to the cavernous sinus, which may result in [[cavernous sinus thrombosis]], a rare but life-threatening condition.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
The signs and symptoms of an infratemporal space infection are swelling of the face in the region of the [[sigmoid notch]], swelling of the mouth in the region of the maxillary tuberosity and marked [[trismus]] (difficulty opening the mouth), since some of the [[muscles of mastication]] are restricted by the swelling.<ref name="Mani 2008" /> Treatment of an abscess of this space is usually by surgical [[incision and drainage]], with the incision being placed on the face (a small horizontal incision posterior to the junction of the temporal and frontal process of the [[zygomatic bone]]. or both on the face and inside the mouth.<ref name="Hupp 2008" />

===Odontogenic infection===
The spread of [[odontogenic infection]]s may sometimes involve the infratemporal space. The most likely causative tooth is the maxillary third molar (upper [[wisdom tooth]]).
