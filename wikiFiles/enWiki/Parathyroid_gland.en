The '''parathyroid glands''' are small [[endocrine system|endocrine]] [[gland]]s in the neck that produce [[parathyroid hormone]].  Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, which are usually located on the rear surface of the [[thyroid gland]], or, in rare cases, within the thyroid gland itself or in the chest. Parathyroid glands control the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.

==Anatomy==

The parathyroid glands are four or more small glands, about the size of a grain of rice, located on the posterior surface (back side) of the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands usually weigh between 25&nbsp;mg and 40&nbsp;mg in humans. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher (closer to the head) are called the '''superior parathyroid glands''', while the lower two are called the '''inferior parathyroid glands'''. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands.

The parathyroid glands are named for their proximity to the thyroid but serve a completely different role than the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands are quite easily recognizable from the thyroid as they have densely packed cells, in contrast with the follicle structure of the [[thyroid]].<ref>{{BUHistology|15001ooa}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lappas D, Noussios G, Anagnostis P, Adamidou F, Chatzigeorgiou A, Skandalakis P |title=Location, number and morphology of parathyroid glands: results from a large anatomical series |journal=Anat Sci Int |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=160–4 |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22689148 |doi=10.1007/s12565-012-0142-1 |url=}}</ref> However, at surgery, they are harder to differentiate from the thyroid or fat.

Because the inferior thyroid arteries provide the primary blood supply to the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland where the parathyroid glands are located, branches of these arteries usually supply the parathyroid glands. However they may also be supplied by the branches of the superior thyroid arteries; the thyroid ima artery; or the laryngeal, tracheal and esophageal artery. Parathyroid veins drain into thyroid plexus of veins of the thyroid gland.

Lymphatic vessels from the parathyroid glands drain into deep cervical lymph nodes and paratracheal lymph nodes.

In the histological sense, they distinguish themselves from the thyroid gland, as they contain two types of cells:<ref>{{BUHistology|15002loa}}</ref>

==History==
The parathyroid glands were first discovered in the [[Indian Rhinoceros]] by [[Richard Owen]] in 1850.<ref name="Cave1953">{{cite book|last=Cave|first=A.J.E.|editor=E.

==Physiology==
The major function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's [[calcium]] level within a very narrow range, so that the [[nervous system|nervous]] and [[muscular system]]s can function properly.

[[Parathyroid hormone]] (PTH, also known as parathormone) is a small [[protein]] that takes part in the control of calcium and [[phosphorus|phosphate]] [[homeostasis]], as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of [[calcitonin]]. 

'''Calcium''' 

PTH increases blood calcium levels by stimulating [[osteoclast]]s to break down bone and release calcium. PTH also increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption by activating [[vitamin D]], and promotes calcium conservation (reabsorption) by the [[kidney]]s. 

'''Phosphate'''

PTH is the major regulator of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal and also distal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus.

Through activation of Vitamin D the absorption of Phosphate is increased.

==Role in disease==
{{main|Parathyroid disease}}
Many conditions are associated with disorders of parathyroid function. These can be divided into those causing [[hyperparathyroidism]], and those causing [[hypoparathyroidism]].

==Embryology and evolution==

The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of [[neural crest]] [[mesenchyme]] and third and fourth [[branchial pouch]] [[endoderm]].

[[Eya-1]] (transcripitonal co-activator), [[Six-1]] (a homeobox transcription factor), and [[Gcm-2]] (a transcription factor) have been associated with the development of the parathyroid gland, and alterations in these genes alters parathyroid gland development.

The superior parathyroids arise from the fourth pharyngeal pouch, and the inferior parathyroids arise from the third pharyngeal pouch. They are vertically transposed during embryogenesis. This is significant in function-preserving parathyroidectomy, because both the superior and the inferior parathyroids are supplied by the inferior thyroid artery. If the surgeon is to leave a single functional parathyroid for the patient, he/she must preserve the appropriate blood supply.

===In other animals===
Parathyroid glands are found in all adult [[tetrapod]]s, although they vary in their number, and in their exact position. [[Mammal]]s typically have four parathyroids, while other groups typically have six. The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning and irregular muscle contractions. <ref>{{cite book|title=Disease and Its Causes|year=1913|publisher=New York Henry Holt and Company London Williams and Norgate The University Press, Cambridge, U.S.A|location=United States|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/manybooks_pdf_new/councilmanw15281528315283-8?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAITZP2AAM27ZGISNQ&Expires=1367017007&Signature=bLVYP0SQHeAi4HeGuy6qsaPNFmg%3D|author=W. T. COUNCILMAN|archivedate=March 8, 2005|language=English|chapter=One}}</ref> 

Fish do not possess parathyroid glands, although the [[ultimobranchial gland]]s, which are found close to the [[oesophagus]], may have a similar function and could even be [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the tetrapod parathyroids. Even these glands are absent in the most primitive vertebrates, the [[jawless fish]], but as these species have no bone in their skeletons, only [[cartilage]], it may be that they have less need to regulate calcium metabolism.

The conserved homology of genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills with those in the parathryroid glands of birds and mammals is recognized by [[evolutionary developmental biology]] as evolution-using genes and gene networks in novel ways to generate new structures with some similar functions and novel functions.
