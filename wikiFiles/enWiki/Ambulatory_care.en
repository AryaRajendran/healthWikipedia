'''Ambulatory care''' is a personal [[health care]] consultation, treatment or intervention using advanced [[medical technology]] or [[Medical procedure|procedures]] delivered on an ''[[outpatient]]'' basis (i.e. where the patient's stay at the [[hospital]] or [[clinic]], from the time of registration to discharge, occurs on a single calendar day).<ref>William Osler Health System.

Many medical investigations and treatments for acute illness and preventive health care can be performed on an ambulatory basis, including minor surgical and medical procedures, most types of dental services, dermatology services, and many types of [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] procedures (e.g. [[blood test]]s, [[medical imaging|X-rays]], [[endoscopy]] and [[biopsy]] procedures of superficial organs). Other types of ambulatory care services include [[Emergency department|emergency]] visits, rehabilitation visits, and in some cases telephone consultations.<ref name="CIHI">Canadian Institute for Health Information.

Ambulatory care services represent the most significant contributor to increasing hospital expenditures and to the performance of the [[health care system]] in most countries, including most developing countries.<ref name="Classification">Karpiel MS.

Health care organizations use different ways to define the nature of care provided as "ambulatory" versus inpatient or other types of care.<ref name="CIHI"/><ref name="Classification"/><ref>Verran JA.

Sites where ambulatory care can be delivered include:

{{anchor|Doctor's office}}[[File:Doctorsoffice.jpg|thumb|190px|right|An examination room in a doctor's office.]]
* Doctor's surgeries (known as doctor's offices in [[American English]]): This is the most common site for the delivery of ambulatory care in many countries, and usually consists of a [[physician's visit]].  Physicians of many specialties deliver ambulatory care.  These physicians include specialists in [[family medicine]], [[internal medicine]], [[obstetrics]], [[gynaecology]], [[cardiology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[endocrinology]], [[ophthalmology]], and [[dermatology]].

* [[Clinic]]s: Including ambulatory care clinics, [[polyclinic]]s, [[ambulatory surgery center]]s, and urgent care centres.
** In the United States, the [http://www.ucaoa.org/ Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA)]  estimates that over 15,000 urgent care centers deliver urgent care services.  These centers are designed to evaluate and treat conditions that are not severe enough to require treatment in a hospital emergency department but still require treatment beyond normal physician office hours or before a physician appointment is available.
** In Russia and other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Feldsher]] health stations are the main site for ambulatory care in rural areas.<ref>Shabarova Z. [http://www.aiha.com/resources/Html/zoya.htm Primary Health Care in the NIS: Soviet Primary Health Care system review.] Accessed 25 July 2011.</ref>

* [[Hospital]]s: Including [[emergency department]]s and other hospital-based services such as same day surgery services and mental health services.
** Hospital emergency departments: Some visits to emergency departments result in hospital admission, so these would be considered [[emergency medicine]] visits rather than ambulatory care.  Most visits to hospital emergency departments, however, do not require hospital admission.  
* Non-medical institution-based settings: Including school and prison health; vision, dental and pharmaceutical care.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== Revisit ==
One or more planned revisits to settings of ambulatory care is the main method of follow-up of previous care in both ambulatory and inpatient settings. It can be regarded as an intermediate level of follow-up between continuous [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] in an inpatient setting on one hand, and the situation where an individual is advised to return only when (or if) symptoms appear or reappear on the other.
