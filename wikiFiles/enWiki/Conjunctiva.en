The '''conjunctiva''' lines the inside of the [[eyelid]]s and covers the [[sclera]] (white part of the [[human eye|eye]]). It is composed of non-keratinized, [[stratified columnar epithelium]] with goblet cells.

==Function==
The conjunctiva helps lubricate the [[human eye|eye]] by producing [[mucus]] and [[tears]], although a smaller volume of [[tears]] than the [[lacrimal gland]].<ref>London Place Eye Center (2003). [http://www.lasereye.com/conjuc.htm Conjunctivitis]. Retrieved July 25, 2004.</ref>
It also contributes to [[immune system|immune surveillance]] and helps to prevent the entrance of [[microbes]] into the eye.

== Anatomy ==

=== Gross anatomy ===
The conjunctiva is typically divided into three parts:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Part
! Area
|-
| Palpebral or tarsal conjunctiva
| Lines the eyelids.
|-
| Bulbar or ocular conjunctiva
| Covers the eyeball, over the anterior [[sclera]]. This region of the conjunctiva is tightly bound to the underlying sclera by [[Tenon's capsule]] and moves with the eyeball movements.
|-
| Fornix conjunctiva
| Forms the junction between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctivas.  It is loose and flexible, allowing the free movement of the lids and eyeball.<ref>Eye, human Encyclopaedia Britannica</ref>
|}

=== Sensory Innervation ===
Sensory innervation of the conjunctiva is divided into four parts:<ref>http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u06/u06_b06.htm</ref>

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Area
! Nerve
|-
| Superior
|
* Supraorbital nerve
* Supratrochlear nerve
* Infratrochlear nerve
|-
| Inferior
| Infraorbital nerve
|-
| Lateral
| Lacrimal nerve (with contribution from zygomaticofacial nerve)
|-
| Circumcorneal
| Long ciliary nerves
|}

=== Histology ===
The conjunctiva consists of non-keratinized, [[stratified squamous epithelium]], with interspersed [[goblet cells]].<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|page=2426|edition=24th ed.}}</ref> The epithelial layer contains blood vessels, fibrous tissue, and lymphatic channels.<ref name=Cecil /> Accessory lacrimal glands in the conjunctiva constantly produce the aqueous portion of tears.<ref name=Cecil /> Additional cells present in the conjunctival epithelium include [[melanocytes]], [[Lymphocyte|T and B cell lymphocytes]].<ref name=Cecil />

==Diseases and disorders==
{{main|List of eye diseases and disorders}}
Disorders of the conjunctiva and [[cornea]] are a common source of eye complaints.

The surface of the eye is exposed to various external influences and is especially susceptible to [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[infections]], chemical irritation, [[allergic reactions]] and [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|dryness]].

The conjunctiva can become [[inflammation|inflamed]] secondary to bacterial infection. The resultant condition is known as [[conjunctivitis]] and commonly referred to as pinkeye.

Conjunctival irritation can occur for a wide variety of reasons including [[dry eye]] and overexposure to VOCs ([[Volatile organic compound]]s).

[[Leptospirosis]], an infection with Leptospira, can cause [[conjunctival suffusion]], which is characterized by chemosis, and redness without exudates.

With age, the conjunctiva can stretch and loosen from the underlying sclera, leading to the formation of conjunctival folds, a condition known as [[conjunctivochalasis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=19916 |title=Conjunctivochalasis - Medical Definition |publisher=Medilexicon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref><ref>WL Hughes Conjunctivochalasis.
