'''Peripheral vascular disease''' (PVD), commonly referred to as '''peripheral artery disease '''(PAD) or '''peripheral artery occlusive disease''' (PAOD), refers to the obstruction of large [[artery|arteries]] ''not'' within the [[coronary]], [[aortic arch]] vasculature, or [[brain]].  PVD can result from [[atherosclerosis]], [[inflammation|inflammatory]] processes leading to [[stenosis]], an [[embolism]], or [[thrombus]] formation. It causes either [[Acute (medical)|acute]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[ischemia]] (lack of blood supply). Often PVD is a term used to refer to atherosclerotic blockages found in the lower extremity.<ref name=Merck>{{MerckManual|07|080|f||Peripheral Arterial Disease}}, Retrieved on August 9, 2010</ref>

PVD also includes a subset of diseases classified as microvascular diseases resulting from episodal narrowing of the arteries ([[Raynaud's phenomenon]]), or widening thereof ([[erythromelalgia]]), i.e. vascular spasms.

==Classification==
Peripheral artery occlusive disease is commonly divided in the Fontaine stages, introduced by René Fontaine in 1954 for [[ischemia]]:<ref>{{cite journal | author=Fontaine R, Kim M, Kieny R | title=Die chirugische Behandlung der peripheren Durchblutungsstörungen. (Surgical treatment of peripheral circulation disorders) | journal=Helvetica Chirurgica Acta | year=1954 | volume=21 | issue=5/6 | pages=499&ndash;533 | language=German | pmid=14366554}}</ref><ref name=TASC2/>

*'''Stage I''': Asymptomatic, incomplete blood vessel obstruction   
*'''Stage II''': Mild [[claudication]]
:*'''Stage IIA''': Claudication at a distance of greater than 200 metres
:*'''Stage IIB''': Claudication distance of less than 200 metres
*'''Stage III''': [[Rest pain]], mostly in the feet
*'''Stage IV''': [[Necrosis]] and/or [[gangrene]] of the limb

A more recent classification by Rutherford consists of three grades and six categories:<ref name=TASC2/>
*'''Category  0''': Asymptomatic
*'''Category  1''': Mild claudication
*'''Category 2''': Moderate claudication 
*'''Category 3''': Severe claudication
*'''Category 4''': Rest pain
*'''Category 5''': Minor tissue loss; Ischemic ulceration not exceeding ulcer of the digits of the foot
*'''Category 6''': Major tissue loss; Severe ischemic ulcers or frank gangrene

==Symptoms==
About 20% of patients with mild PAD may be asymptomatic; other symptoms include:<ref name=Merck/>
* [[Claudication]]—pain, weakness, numbness, or cramping in muscles due to decreased blood flow
* Sores, wounds, or ulcers that heal slowly or not at all
* Noticeable change in color (blueness or paleness) or temperature (coolness) when compared to the other limb (termed unilateral dependent rubor; when both limbs are affected this is termed bilateral dependent rubor)
* Diminished hair and nail growth on affected limb and digits

==Causes==
Risk factors contributing to PAD are the same as those for [[atherosclerosis]]:<ref name=Merck/><ref>Joosten MM, Pai JK, Bertoia ML, Rimm EB, Spiegelman D, Mittleman MA, Mukamal KJ.

* [[Dyslipidemia]] (high low density lipoprotein [LDL] [[cholesterol]], low high density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol) - elevation of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and [[triglyceride]] levels each have been correlated with accelerated PAD. Correction of dyslipidemia by diet and/or medication is associated with a major improvement in  rates of heart attack and stroke.<ref>Unit ES: Efficacy and safety of cholesterol-lowering treatment: prospective meta-analysis of data from 90 056 participants in 14 randomised trials of statins.

==  Individuals at Risk for Lower Extremity Peripheral Arterial Disease<ref name= TASC2/><ref name=Acc/><ref name=aha/>==
*  All patients who have Leg symptoms with exertion (suggestive of [[claudication]]) or ischemic [[rest pain]].
*  All patients aged 65 years and over regardless of [[risk factor]] status.
*  All patients between the age of 50 to 69 and who have a cardiovascular risk factor (particularly [[diabetes]] or smoking).
*  Age less than 50 years, with diabetes and one other atherosclerosis risk factor (smoking, [[dyslipidemia]], [[hypertension]], or [[hyperhomocysteinemia]]).
*  Abnormal lower extremity [[pulse examination]].
*  Known atherosclerotic coronary, carotid, or renal artery disease.
* All patients with a [[Framingham risk score]] 10%-20%

   

==Diagnosis==
Upon suspicion of PVD, the first-line study is the [[ankle brachial pressure index]] (ABPI/ABI). When the blood pressure readings in the ankles is lower than that in the arms, blockages in the arteries which provide blood from the heart to the ankle are suspected. Normal ABI range of 1.00 to 1.40.The patient is diagnosed with PAD when the ABI is ≤ 0.90 . ABI values of 0.91 to 0.99 are considered ‘‘borderline’’ and values >1.40 indicate noncompressible arteries. PAD is graded as mild to moderate if the ABI is between 0.41 and 0.90, and an ABI less than 0.40 is suggestive of severe PAD. These relative categories have prognostic value<ref name=Acc/><ref name=aha/>

In patients with suspected PAD but normal resting ABIs, exercise testing of ABI can be done. A base line ABI is obtained prior to exercise. The patient is then asked exercise (usually patients are made to walk in treadmill at a constant speed) until claudication pain occurs (or a maximum of 5 minutes), following which the ankle pressure is again measured. A decrease in ABI of15%-20%would be diagnostic of PAD .<ref name=Acc/><ref name= TASC2/>

It is possible for conditions which stiffen the vessel walls (such as calcifications that occur in the setting of chronic diabetes) to produce [[false negatives]] usually, but not always, indicated by abnormally high ABIs (> 1.40). Such results and suspicions merit further investigation and higher level studies.<ref name="Vowden">{{cite journal |author=Vowden P, Vowden K |title=Doppler assessment and ABPI: Interpretation in the management of leg ulceration |journal=Worldwide Wounds  |month=March |year=2001 |url=http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2001/march/Vowden/Doppler-assessment-and-ABPI.html}} - describes ABPI procedure, interpretation of results, and notes the somewhat arbitrary selection of "ABPI of 0.8 has become the accepted endpoint for high compression therapy, the trigger for referral for a vascular surgical opinion and the defining upper marker for an ulcer of mixed aetiology"</ref>

If ABIs are abnormal the next step is generally a lower limb [[Medical ultrasonography#Doppler sonography|doppler ultrasound]] examination to look at site and extent of [[atherosclerosis]]. Other imaging can be performed by [[angiogram|angiography]],<ref name=Merck/> where a catheter is inserted into the common [[femoral artery]] and selectively guided to the artery in question. While injecting a [[Radiodensity|radiodense]] contrast agent an [[X-ray]] is taken. Any flow limiting [[stenosis|stenoses]] found in the x-ray can be identified and treated by [[atherectomy]], [[angioplasty]] or [[stent]]ing. Contrast angiography is the most readily available and widely used imaging technique.
 
Modern multislice [[computerized tomography]] (CT) scanners provide direct imaging of the arterial system as an alternative to angiography. CT provides complete evaluation of the [[aorta]] and lower limb arteries without the need for an angiogram's arterial injection of contrast agent.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of a large magnet, radio frequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images to provide pictures of blood vessels inside the body. The advantages of MRA include its safety and ability to provide high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the entire abdomen, pelvis and lower extremities in one setting.<ref>Leiner T, Kessels AG, Nelemans PJ, Vasbinder GBC, de Haan MW, Kitslaar PE, Ho KYJ, Tordoir JH, van Engelshoven JM: Peripheral Arterial Disease: Comparison of Color Duplex US and Contrast-enhanced MR Angiography for Diagnosis1.

==Treatment==
Dependent on the severity of the disease, the following steps can be taken:<ref name=PMID12637405/>
* [[Smoking cessation]] (cigarettes promote PVD and are a risk factor for [[cardiovascular disease]]).
* Management of diabetes.
* Management of hypertension.
* Management of cholesterol, and medication with [[antiplatelet drug]]s.  Medication with [[aspirin]], [[clopidogrel]] and [[statins]], which reduce clot formation and cholesterol levels, respectively, can help with disease progression and address the other cardiovascular risks that the patient is likely to have.
* Regular exercise for those with claudication helps open up alternative small vessels (collateral flow) and the limitation in walking often improves.  Treadmill exercise (35 to 50 minutes, 3 to 4 times per week<ref name=Merck/>) has been reviewed as another treatment with a number of positive outcomes including reduction in cardiovascular events and improved quality of life.
* [[Cilostazol]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robless P, Mikhailidis DP, Stansby GP |title=Cilostazol for peripheral arterial disease |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD003748 |year=2008 |pmid=18254032 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003748.pub3 |url= |editor1-last=Robless |editor1-first=Peter}}</ref> or [[pentoxifylline]] treatment to relieve symptoms of claudication.<ref name=Merck/>
Treatment with other drugs or vitamins are unsupported by clinical evidence, "but trials evaluating the effect of folate and vitamin B-12 on [[Hyperhomocysteinemia|hyperhomocysteinaemia]], a putative vascular risk factor, are near completion".<ref name=PMID12637405/>

After a trial of the best medical treatment outline above, if symptoms remain unnacceptable, patients may be referred to a vascular or endovascular surgeon; however, "No convincing evidence supports the use of percutaneous balloon angioplasty or stenting in patients with intermittent claudication".<ref name=PMID12637405/>

* [[Angioplasty]] (PTA or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) can be done on solitary lesions in large [[artery|arteries]], such as the [[femoral artery]], but angioplasty may not have sustained benefits.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fowkes FG, Gillespie IN |title=Angioplasty (versus non surgical management) for intermittent claudication |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000017 |year=2000 |pmid=10796469 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000017 |url= |editor1-last=Fowkes |editor1-first=Gerry}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Twine CP, Coulston J, Shandall A, McLain AD |title=Angioplasty versus stenting for superficial femoral artery lesions |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD006767 |year=2009 |pmid=19370653 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006767.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Twine |editor1-first=Christopher P}}</ref>Patency rates following angioplasty is highest for [[iliac Arteries]], and decrease with artery towards toes.other criteria that affect out come following revascularization are length of the lesion, number of lesion.<ref>Johnston KW, Rae M, Hogg-Johnston SA, Colapinto RF, Walker PM, Baird RJ, Sniderman KW, Kalman P: 5-year results of a prospective study of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.

* [[Atherectomy|Plaque excision]], in which the plaque is scraped off of the inside of the vessel wall.
* Occasionally, [[Bypass (surgical)|bypass]] grafting is needed to circumvent a seriously stenosed area of the arterial vasculature. Generally, the [[saphenous vein]] is used, although artificial ([[Gore-Tex]]) material is often used for large tracts when the veins are of lesser quality.
* Rarely, [[sympathectomy]] is used - removing the nerves that make arteries contract, effectively leading to vasodilatation.
* When [[gangrene]] of the toes has set in, [[amputation]] is often a last resort to stop infected dying tissues from causing [[septicemia]].
* [[Arterial thrombosis]] or embolism has a dismal prognosis, but is occasionally treated successfully with [[thrombolysis]].

===Guidelines===
Several different guideline standards have been developed, including:

==Prognosis==
Individuals with PAD have an "exceptionally elevated risk for cardiovascular events and the majority will eventually die of a cardiac or cerebrovascular etiology"; <ref name=PMID17580733>{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/vhrm.2007.3.2.229 |author=Shammas NW |title=Epidemiology, classification, and modifiable risk factors of peripheral arterial disease |journal=Vasc Health Risk Manag |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=229–34 |year=2007 |pmid=17580733 |pmc=1994028}}</ref> prognosis is correlated with the severity of the PAD as measured by the [[Ankle brachial pressure index]] (ABPI). <ref name=PMID17580733/> Large-vessel PAD increases mortality from cardiovascular disease significantly.  PAD carries a greater than "20% risk of a coronary event in 10 years".<ref name=PMID17580733/> 

There is a low risk that an individual with claudication will develop severe ischemia and require amputation, but the risk of death from coronary events is three to four times higher than matched controls without claudication. <ref name=PMID12637405>{{cite journal |author=Burns P, Gough S, Bradbury AW |title=Management of peripheral arterial disease in primary care |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7389 |pages=584–8 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12637405 |pmc=1125476 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7389.584}}</ref> Of patients with intermittent claudication, only "7% will undergo lower extremity bypass surgery, 4% major amputations, and 16% worsening claudication", but stroke and heart attack events are elevated, and the "5-year mortality rate is estimated to be 30% (versus 10% in controls)".<ref name=PMID17580733/>

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease in the general population is 12–14%, affecting up to 20% of those over 70;<ref name=PMID17580733/> 70%–80% of affected individuals are asymptomatic; only a minority ever require revascularisation or amputation.  Peripheral vascular disease affects 1 in 3 diabetics over the age of 50.

In the USA peripheral arterial disease affects 12–20 percent of Americans age 65 and older. Approximately 10 million Americans have PVD. Despite its prevalence and cardiovascular risk implications, only 25 percent of PAD patients are undergoing treatment. 

The incidence of symptomatic PVD increases with age, from about 0.3% per year for men aged 40–55 years to about 1% per year for men aged over 75 years. The prevalence of PVD varies considerably depending on how PAD is defined, and the age of the population being studied. Diagnosis is critical, as people with PAD have a four to five times higher risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[stroke]].

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study trials in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, demonstrated that glycemic control is more strongly associated with microvascular disease than macrovascular disease. It may be that pathologic changes occurring in small vessels are more sensitive to chronically elevated glucose levels than is atherosclerosis occurring in larger arteries.<ref name=diabetesjournals>{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-2018 |author=Selvin E, Wattanakit K, Steffes MW, Coresh J, Sharrett AR |title=HbA1c and peripheral arterial disease in diabetes: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=877–82 |year=2006 |month=April  |pmid=16567831|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/4/877.long}}</ref>
