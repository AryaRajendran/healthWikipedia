'''Polytetrafluoroethylene''' ('''PTFE''') is a synthetic [[fluoropolymer]] of [[tetrafluoroethylene]] that finds numerous applications. The best known brand name of PTFE is '''Teflon''' by [[DuPont]] Co.

PTFE is a [[fluorocarbon]] solid, as it is a high-[[molecular weight|molecular-weight]] compound consisting wholly of [[carbon]] and [[fluorine]]. PTFE is [[hydrophobic]]: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated [[London dispersion force]]s due to the high [[electronegativity]] of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of [[friction]] against any solid.

PTFE is used as a [[non-stick]] coating for pans and other [[cookware]]. It is very non-reactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon–fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is also commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions.

It is commonly believed that Teflon is a spin-off product from the [[NASA]] space projects. Though it has been used by NASA, the assumption is incorrect.<ref name="NASASpinOff">[http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinfaq.htm NASA Spinoff] under Are Tang, Teflon, and Velcro NASA spinoffs?</ref>

== History ==
PTFE was accidentally discovered in 1938 by [[Roy Plunkett]], in New Jersey while he was working for [[Kinetic Chemicals]]. As Plunkett was attempting to make a new [[chlorofluorocarbon]] refrigerant, the [[tetrafluoroethylene]] gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling "empty." Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart. Inside, he found it coated with a waxy white material which was oddly slippery. Analysis of the material showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure. Kinetic Chemicals patented the new fluorinated plastic (analogous to known [[polyethylene]]) in 1941,<ref>{{Cite patent|inventor-last = Plunkett|inventor-first = Roy J|inventorlink = Roy Plunkett|issue-date = 4 February 1941|title = Tetrafluoroethylene polymers|country-code = US|patent-number = 2230654}}</ref> and registered the Teflon trademark in 1945.<ref name="fluoroboom">{{cite news|title = History Timeline 1930: The Fluorocarbon Boom|url= http://www2.dupont.com/Refrigerants/en_US/sales_support/history_1930.html|accessdate =10 June 2009|publisher=''[[DuPont]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = Roy Plunkett: 1938|url = http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1938_dupont/1938_indepth.html|accessdate =10 June 2009}}</ref>

DuPont, which founded Kinetic Chemicals in partnership with [[General Motors]], was producing over two million pounds (900 tons) of Teflon brand PTFE per year in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]], by 1948.<ref>American Heritage's Invention & Technology, Fall 2010, vol. 25, no. 3, p. 42</ref> An early advanced use was in the [[Manhattan Project]] as a material to coat valves and seals in the pipes holding highly reactive [[uranium hexafluoride]] at the vast [[K-25]] [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment]] plant at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].<ref name = "rhodes">

The [[coefficient of friction]] of plastics is usually measured against polished steel.<ref>[http://www.matweb.com/reference/coefficient-of-friction.asp Coefficient of Friction (COF) Testing of Plastics] MatWeb Material Property Data Retrieved 1 January 2007.</ref> PTFE's coefficient of friction is 0.05 to 0.10,<ref name=dupont/> which is the third-lowest of any known solid material ([[Aluminium magnesium boride|BAM]] being the first, with a coefficient of friction of 0.02; [[diamond-like carbon]] being second-lowest at 0.05). PTFE's resistance to [[van der Waals force]]s means that it is the only known surface to which a [[gecko]] cannot stick.<ref name="gecko">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071014063923/http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~peattiea/research_main.html Research into Gecko Adhesion ]", ''[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]'', 2007-10-14, Retrieved 8 April 2010.</ref>

PTFE has excellent [[dielectric]] properties. This is especially true at high [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]], making it suitable for use as an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] in [[cable]]s and [[electrical connector|connector]] assemblies and as a material for [[printed circuit board]]s used at [[microwave]] frequencies. Combined with its high melting temperature, this makes it the material of choice as a high-performance substitute for the weaker and lower melting point [[polyethylene]] that is commonly used in low-cost applications.

Because of its chemical inertness, PTFE cannot be [[cross-link]]ed like an [[elastomer]]. Therefore, it has no "memory" and is subject to [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. This is advantageous when used as a [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]], because the material creeps a small amount to conform to the mating surface. However, to keep the seal from creeping too much, fillers are used, which can also improve wear resistance and reduce friction. Sometimes, metal springs apply continuous force to PTFE seals to give good contact, while permitting a beneficially low percentage of creep.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== Applications and uses ==
Owing to its low friction, it is used for applications where sliding action of parts is needed: [[plain bearing]]s, [[gear]]s, [[slide plate]]s, etc. In these applications, it performs significantly better than [[nylon]] and [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]]; it is comparable to [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE), although UHMWPE is more resistant to wear than PTFE, for these applications, versions of PTFE with mineral oil or [[molybdenum disulfide]] embedded as additional [[lubricant]]s in its matrix are being manufactured.
Its extremely high bulk [[resistivity]] makes it an ideal material for fabricating long-life [[electret]]s, useful devices that are the [[electrostatic]] analogues of [[magnet]]s.

[[Gore-Tex]] is a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores. The roof of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis]], USA,  is one of the largest applications of PTFE coatings, using {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of the material in a double-layered, white dome, made using fiberglass with a PTFE coating.

PTFE is also used as a film interface patch for sports and medical applications, featuring a pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, which is installed in strategic high friction areas of footwear, insoles, [[ankle-foot orthosis]], and other medical devices to prevent and relieve friction-induced blisters, calluses, and foot ulceration.

Powdered PTFE is used in [[pyrotechnic composition]]s as [[oxidizer]]s together with powdered metals such as [[aluminium]] and [[magnesium]]. Upon ignition, these mixtures form carbonaceous [[soot]] and the corresponding metal [[fluoride]], and release large amounts of heat. Hence they are used as [[infrared decoy flare]]s and [[igniter]]s for [[solid-fuel rocket]] [[propellant]]s.<ref name=koch>{{cite journal|author=E.-C. Koch|title=Metal-Fluorocarbon Pyrolants:III. Development and Application of Magnesium/Teflon/Viton|journal=Propellants Explosives Pyrotechnics |year=2002|volume=27|pages=262–266|doi=10.1002/1521-4087(200211)27:5<262::AID-PREP262>3.0.CO;2-8|issue=5}}</ref>

In optical [[radiometry]], sheets made from PTFE are used as measuring heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., [[illuminance]] meters and [[Ultraviolet|UV]] [[radiometer]]s) due to its capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant over a wide range of wavelengths, from UV down to near [[infrared]]. In this region, the relation of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a [[diffuser (optics)|diffuser]] (PTFE sheet) radiates like [[Lambert's cosine law]]. Thus, PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g., in solar [[irradiance]] measurements.

PTFE is also used to coat certain types of hardened, [[Armour-piercing bullet|armor-piercing bullet]]s, so as to prevent the increased wear on the firearm's rifling that would result from the harder projectile, however it is not the PTFE itself that gives the bullet its armor-piercing property.<ref>[http://www.guncite.com/ktwint.html].</ref>

High corrosion resistance favors the use of PTFE in laboratory environments as containers, as magnetic stirrer coatings, and as tubing for highly corrosive chemicals such as [[hydrofluoric acid]], which will dissolve glass containers. It is used in containers for storing [[fluoroantimonic acid]], a [[superacid]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

PTFE tubes are used in gas-gas heat exchangers in gas cleaning of waste incinerators. Unit power capacity is typically several megawatts.

PTFE is also widely used as a [[thread seal tape]] in plumbing applications, largely replacing paste thread dope.

PTFE membrane filters are among the most efficient used in industrial air filtration applications. Filter coated with a PTFE membrane are often used within a [[dust collection system]] to collect [[aerosol|particulate matter]] from air streams in applications involving high temperatures and high particulate loads such as coal-fired power plants, cement production, and steel foundries.

PTFE grafts can be used to bypass [[stenosis|stenotic]] [[artery|arteries]] in peripheral vascular disease, if a suitable autologous [[vein]] graft is not available.

PTFE can be used to prevent insects climbing up surfaces painted with the material. PTFE is so slippery that insects cannot get a grip and tend to fall off. For example, PTFE is used to prevent ants climbing out of [[formicarium|formicaria]].
PTFE is also sometimes used as feet for [[computer mice]], to reduce the friction with a [[mousepad]] or other tracking surface.<ref>[http://mindprod.com/bgloss/mousefeet.html Mouse Feet] Computer Hardware Buyers' Glossary, 20 April 2007. Retrieved 07 January 2012.</ref>

Meat is usually fried between {{convert|400| and |450|F|C}}, and most oils will start to smoke before a temperature of {{convert|500|F|C}} is reached, but there are at least two cooking oils (refined [[safflower oil]] and [[avocado oil]]) that have a higher [[smoke point]] than {{convert|500|F|C}}. Empty cookware can also exceed this temperature upon heating.

== Similar polymers ==
[[File:PFA structure.PNG|thumb|Teflon is also used as the trade name for a polymer with similar properties, perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin (PFA).]]

Other polymers with similar composition are also known by the Teflon trade name:
*[[Perfluoroalkoxy]] (PFA)
*[[Fluorinated ethylene propylene]] (FEP)

These retain the useful PTFE properties of low friction and nonreactivity, but are more easily formable. For example, FEP is softer than PTFE and melts at {{convert|533|K}}; it is also highly transparent and resistant to sunlight.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100724195156/http://www.texloc.com/closet/cl_fep_properties.htm FEP Detailed Properties], Parker-TexLoc, 13 April 2006.
