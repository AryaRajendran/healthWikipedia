A '''tumor''' ([[American English]]) or '''tumour''' ([[British English]]) is commonly used as a synonym for a [[neoplasm]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |title=Tumor |edition=31st |year=2007 |publisher=[[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] |isbn=9781849723480 }}</ref> (a solid or fluid-filled [cystic] [[lesion]] that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of ''neoplastic'' cells) that appears enlarged in size. ''Tumor'' is not synonymous with [[cancer]]. While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be [[Benign tumor|benign]], [[precancerous condition|pre-malignant]], or [[Malignancy|malignant]], or can represent a lesion without any cancerous potential whatsoever.

The terms "mass" and "nodule" are often used synonymously with "tumor". Generally speaking, however, the term "tumor" is used generically, without reference to the physical size of the lesion. More specifically, the term "mass" is often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters (mm) in greatest direction, while the term "[[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]" is usually used when the size of the lesion is less than 20&nbsp;mm in its greatest dimension (25.4&nbsp;mm = 1&nbsp;inch).

== Etymology ==
The term tumour/tumor is derived from the [[Latin]] word for "swelling" – ''tumor''. It is similar to the [[Old French]] ''tumour'' (contemporary French: ''tumeur''). In the Commonwealth the spelling "tumour" is commonly used, whereas in the U.S. it is usually spelled "tumor".

In its medical sense it has traditionally meant an abnormal swelling of the flesh. The Roman medical encyclopedist [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca 30 BC–38 AD) described the four cardinal signs of acute [[inflammation]] as ''tumor'', ''[[Pain|dolor]]'', ''calor'', and ''[[rubor]]'' (swelling, pain, increased heat, and redness). His treatise, [[De Medicina]], was the first medical book printed in 1478 following the invention of the movable-type printing press.

In contemporary English, the word tumor is often used as a synonym for a cystic (liquid-filled) growth or solid [[neoplasm]] (cancerous or non-cancerous),<ref>''Tumor'' in [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001310.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia]</ref> with other forms of swelling often referred to as ''[[Swelling (medical)|swellings]]''.<ref>''Swelling'' in [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003103.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia]</ref>

Related terms are common in the medical literature, where the nouns tumefaction and [[tumescence]] (derived from the adjective tumefied), are current medical terms for non-neoplastic swelling. This type of swelling is most often caused by inflammation caused by trauma, infection, and other factors.

Tumors may be caused by conditions other than an overgrowth of neoplastic cells, however. Cysts (such as sebaceous cysts) are also referred to as tumors, even though they have no neoplastic cells. This is standard in medical billing terminology (especially when billing for a growth whose pathology has yet to be determined).

== Causes ==
[[Image:Hidradenoma.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Neoplasm|Neoplastic]] tumor of the cheek skin, here a [[Benign tumor|benign neoplasm]] of the [[sweat glands]] called [[hidradenoma]], which is not solid but is fluid-filled]]
A neoplasm can be caused by an abnormal proliferation of tissues, which can be caused by genetic [[mutation]]s. Not all types of neoplasms cause a tumorous overgrowth of tissue, however (such as [[leukemia]] or [[carcinoma in situ]]). 

Recently, tumor growth has been studied using mathematics and continuum mechanics. Vascular tumors are thus looked at as being amalgams of a solid skeleton formed by sticky cells and an organic liquid filling the spaces in which cells can grow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ambrosi |first1=D. |last2=Mollica |first2=F. |year=2002 |title=On the mechanics of a growing tumor |journal=International Journal of Engineering Science |volume=40 |issue=12 |pages=1297–1316 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7225(02)00014-9}}</ref> Under this type of model, mechanical stresses and strains can be dealt with and their influence on the growth of the tumor and the surrounding tissue and vasculature elucidated. Recent findings from experiments that use this model show that active growth of the tumor is restricted to the outer edges of the tumor, and that stiffening of the underlying normal tissue inhibits tumor growth as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Volokh |first=K.Y. |year=2006 |title=Stresses in growing soft tissues |journal=Acta Biomaterialia |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=493–504 |doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2006.04.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706106000432}}</ref>

Benign conditions that are ''not'' associated with an abnormal proliferation of tissue (such as [[sebaceous cyst]]s) can also present as tumors, however, but have no malignant potential. [[Breast cyst]]s (as occur commonly during pregnancy and at other times) are another example, as are other encapsulated glandular swellings (thyroid, adrenal gland, pancreas).

Encapsulated hematomas, encapsulated necrotic tissue (from an insect bite, foreign body, or other noxious mechanism), [[keloid]]s (discrete overgrowths of scar tissue) and [[granuloma]]s may also present as tumors.

Discrete localized enlargements of normal structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or [[Enteric duplication cyst|gastrointestinal duplications]]) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It can be dangerous to [[biopsy]] a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy and/or surgical exploration/excision in an attempt to avoid such severe complications.

The nature of a tumor is determined by imaging, by surgical exploration, and/or by a [[Anatomical pathology|pathologist]] after examination of the tissue from a biopsy or a [[Surgery|surgical specimen]].
