==Signs and Symptoms==

Patients diagnosed with porencephaly display a variety of symptoms, from mild to severe effects on the patient. Patients with severe cases of porencephaly suffer [[epileptic seizures]] and developmental delays, whereas patients with a mild case of porencephaly display little to no seizures and healthy neurodevelopment. Infants with extensive defects show symptoms of the disorder shortly after birth, and the diagnosis is usually made before the age of 1.<ref name="Parker"/><ref name="Shimizu">Shimizu, M. , Maeda, T. , & Izumi, T.

[[File:Brain MRI 0037 10.jpg|thumb|Brain MRI 0037 10]]

Porencephaly is a rare disorder. The exact prevalence of porencephaly is not known; however, it has been reported that 6.8% of patients with [[cerebral palsy]] or 68% of patients with [[epilepsy]] and congenital vascular [[hemiparesis]] have porencephaly.<ref name="Debus"/> Porencephaly has a number of different, often unknown, causes including absence of brain development and destruction of brain tissue. With limited research, the most commonly regarded cause of porencephaly is disturbances in blood circulation, ultimately leading to brain damage.<ref name="Yoneda"/> However, a number of different and multiple factors such as abnormal brain development or damage to the brain tissue can also affect the development of porencephaly.<ref name="Parker"/> 

The following text lists out potential risk factors of developing porencephaly and porencephalic cysts and cavities along with brief description of certain terminologies.<ref name="Hirowatari"/><ref name="Yoneda"/><ref name="Shimizu"/><ref name = "Tonni">Tonni, G. , Ferrari, B. , Defelice, C. , & Centini, G.

Cysts or cavities can occur anywhere within the brain and the locations of these cysts depend highly on the patient. Cysts can develop in the [[frontal lobe]], [[parietal lobe]], [[forebrain]], [[hindbrain]], [[temporal lobe]], or virtually anywhere in the [[cerebral hemisphere]].<ref name="Shimizu"/>

===Genetics===

From recent studies, [[mutations|de novo]] and inherited mutations in the gene ''[[COL4A1]]'', suggesting genetic predisposition within the family, that encodes [[type IV collagen α1 chain]] has shown to be associated with and present in patients with porencephaly. ''COL4A1'' mutation causes a variety of [[phenotypes]], including porencephaly, infantile [[hemiplegia]], and [[cerebral small vessel diseases]] involving both [[stroke]] and [[infarction]].<ref name="Yoneda"/> Abnormal gene expression of ''COL4A1'' can contribute to the development of porencephaly. ''COL4A1'' gene expresses a type IV collagen (basement protein) that is present in all tissue and blood vessels and is extremely important for the structural stability of vascular [[basement membranes]]. The ''COL4A1'' protein provides a strong layer around blood vessels.<ref name="Thomas">Thomas, L. (2005). Genetic Mutation Predisposes to Porencephaly. Lancet Neurology, 4(7), 400.</ref> The mutation can weaken the blood vessels within the brain, elevating the probability of a [[hemorrhage]], and eventually promoting internal bleeding then leading to porencephaly during neurodevelopment of infantile stage.<ref name="Yoneda"/> Therefore, the formation of cavities can be a result of hemorrhages which promote [[cerebral degeneration]].<ref name="Thomas"/> In a mouse model, mouse with ''COL4A1'' mutations displayed [[cerebral hemorrhage]], porencephaly, and abnormal development of vascular basement membranes, such as uneven edges, inconsistent shapes, and highly variable thickness.<ref name="Yoneda"/> Purposely causing a mutation in the ''COL4A1'' gene caused several mouse to develop cerebral hemorrhage and porencephaly-like diseases. Though, there is no direct correlation between mutations of the ''COL4A1'' gene, it appears that it has an influential effect on the development of porencephaly.<ref name="Schmidt">Schmidt, M. , Klumpp, S. , Amort, K. , Jawinski, S. , & Kramer, M. (2012). Porencephaly in Dogs and Cats: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings and Clinical Signs. Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound: The Official Journal of the American College of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association, 53(2), 142-149.</ref><ref name ="Meuwissen">Meuwissen, M. , de Vries, L. , Verbeek, H. , Lequin, M. , Govaert, P. , et al. (2011). Sporadic COL4A1 Mutations with Extensive Prenatal Porencephaly Resembling Hydranencephaly. Neurology,76(9), 844-846.</ref><ref name = "Breedveld">Breedveld, G. , de Coo, I. , Lequin, M. , Arts, W. , Heutink, P. , et al. (2006). Novel Mutations in Three Families Confirm a Major Role of COL4A1 in Hereditary Porencephaly. Journal of Medical Genetics, 43(6), 490-495.</ref>

Another genetic mutation, ''[[factor V G1691A]]'' mutation, has been reported to show possible association to the development of porencephaly. A mutation in ''factor V G1691A'' increases the risk of [[thrombosis]], blood clots, in [[neonates]], infants, and children.<ref name="Debus">Debus, O. , Kosch, A. , Strater, R. , Rossi, R. , & Nowak-Gottl, U. (2004). The ''factor V G1691A'' Mutation is a Risk for Porencephaly: A Case-control Study.Annals of Neurology, 56(2), 287-290.</ref> Therefore, 76 porencephalic and 76 healthy infants were investigated for ''factor V G1691A'' mutation along with other different [[prothrombotic risk factors]]. The results indicated that there was  higher prevalence of the ''factor V G1691A'' mutation in the porencephalic patient group. The prediction that childhood porencephaly is caused by [[hypercoagulable state]], a condition where one has a higher chance of developing blood clots, was supported by the significance of the ''factor V G1691A'' mutation. Also, pregnant women in hypercoagulable state can cause the fetus to have the same risks, therefore possibly causing fetal loss, brain damage, lesions, and infections that lead to porencephaly.  However, other different prothrombotic risk factors individually did not reach statistical significance to link it to the development of porencephaly, but a combination of multiple prothrombotic risk factors in the porencephaly group was significant. Overall, ''factor V G1691A'' mutation has been linked to the development of porencephaly. However, this one mutation is not the cause of porencephaly, and whether further prothrombiotic risk factors are associated with porencephaly still remains unknown.<ref name="Debus"/>

==Diagnostics==

The presence of porencephalic cysts or cavities can be detected using trans-illumination of the skull of infant patients. Porencephaly is usually diagnosed clinically using the patients and families history, clinical observations, or based on the presence of certain characteristic neurological and physiological features of porencephaly. Advanced medical imaging with [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), or with [[ultrasonography]] can be used as a method to exclude other possible neurological disorders. The diagnosis can be made antenatally with ultrasound. Other assessments include memory, speech, or intellect testing to help further determine the exact diagnose of the disorder.<ref name="Parker"/>

==Treatments==

Currently, there is no cure for porencephaly because of the limited resources and knowledge about the neurological disorder. However, several treatment options are available. Treatment may include physical therapy, rehabilitation, medication for [[seizures]] or [[epilepsy]], [[shunt (medical)]], or [[neurosurgery]] (removal of the cyst).<ref name="Parker"/> According to the location, extent of the lesion, size of cavities, and severity of the disorder, combinations of treatment methods are imposed. In porencephaly patients, patients achieved good seizure control with appropriate drug therapy including [[valproate]], [[carbamazepine]], and [[clobazam]].<ref name="Yoneda"/><ref name="Shimizu"/> Also, [[anti-epileptic drugs]] served as another positive method of treatment.<ref name="Shimizu"/>

==Prognosis==
The severity of the symptoms associated with porencephaly varies significantly across the population of those affected, depending on the location of the cyst and damage of the brain. For some patients with porencephaly, only minor neurological problems may develop, and those patients can live normal lives. Therefore, based on the level of severity, self-care is possible, but for the more serious cases lifelong care will be necessary.<ref name="Parker"/> For those that have severe disability, early diagnosis, medication, participation in rehabilitation related to fine-motor control skills, and communication therapies can significantly improve the symptoms and ability of the patient with porencephaly to live a normal life. Infants with porencephaly that survive, with proper treatment, can display proper communication skills, movement, and live a normal life.

==Research==
Under the United States federal government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and National Institute of Health are involved in conducting and supporting research related to normal and abnormal brain and nervous system development. Information gained from the research is used to develop understanding of the mechanism of porencephaly and used to offer new methods of treatment and prevention for developmental brain disorders such as porencephaly.<ref name="Parker"/>
