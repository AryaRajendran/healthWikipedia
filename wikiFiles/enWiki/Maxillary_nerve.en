The '''maxillary nerve''' (CN V<sub>2</sub>) is one of the three branches of the [[trigeminal nerve]], the fifth [[cranial nerve]].  It comprises the principal functions of sensation from the [[maxilla|maxillary]], [[nasal cavity]], [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]], the [[palate]] and subsequently that of the mid-face,<ref>Monkhouse, Stanley (2006)., page 5, Table 1.1 - "Synopsis of cranial nerves"</ref> and is intermediate, both in position and size, between the [[ophthalmic nerve]] and the [[mandibular nerve]]. Its function is the transmission of sensory fibers from the maxillary teeth, the skin between the [[palpebral fissure]] and the [[mouth]], and from the nasal cavity and sinuses.<ref>Monkhouse, Stanley (2006)., page 56, Section 9.1 - Functions</ref>

==Path==
[[Image:Maxillary example system.svg|thumb|600px|right|An illustration of the path of the Maxillary nerve.]]
Anterior to the [[trigeminal ganglion]], the maxillary nerve passes through the [[cavernous sinus]] and exits the [[human skull|skull]] through the [[foramen rotundum]].
[[File:Maxillary nerve.jpg|thumb|right|600px|Maxillary nerve.]]

It begins at the middle of the [[trigeminal ganglion]] as a flattened plexiform band, and, passing horizontally forward, it leaves the skull through the [[foramen rotundum]], where it becomes more cylindrical in form, and firmer in texture. 

It then crosses the [[pterygopalatine fossa]], inclines lateralward on the back of the [[maxilla]], and enters the orbit through the [[inferior orbital fissure]]. It traverses the infraorbital groove and canal in the floor of the orbit, and appears upon the face at the [[infraorbital foramen]]. There, it is called the [[infraorbital nerve]], a terminal branch. 

At its termination, the nerve lies beneath the [[quadratus labii superioris]], and divides into a leash of branches that spread out upon the side of the [[Human nose|nose]], the lower [[eyelid]], and the upper [[lip]], joining with filaments of the [[facial nerve]].

==Branches==

Its branches may be divided into four groups, depending upon where they branch off: in the cranium, in the pterygopalatine fossa, in the infraorbital canal, or on the face.

===In the cranium===
* [[Middle meningeal nerve]] in the [[meninges]]

===From the pterygopalatine fossa===
* [[Infraorbital nerve]] through [[Infraorbital canal]]
* [[Zygomatic nerve]] ([[zygomaticotemporal nerve]], [[zygomaticofacial nerve]]) through [[Inferior orbital fissure]]
* [[Nasal Branches]] ([[nasopalatine]]) through [[Sphenopalatine foramen]]
* Superior alveolar nerves ([[Posterior superior alveolar nerve]], [[Middle superior alveolar nerve]], [[Anterior superior alveolar nerve]])
* Palatine Nerves ([[Greater palatine nerve]], [[Lesser palatine nerve]])
* [[Pharyngeal nerve]]

===In the infraorbital canal===
* [[Anterior superior alveolar nerve]]
* [[Infraorbital nerve]]

===On the face===
* [[Inferior palpebral nerve]]
* [[Superior labial nerve]]
