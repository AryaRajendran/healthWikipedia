'''Teenage Cancer Trust''' is a charity that focuses on the needs of [[teenager]]s and young adults with [[cancer]], [[leukaemia]], Hodgkin’s and related diseases by providing specialist teenage units in [[National Health Service|NHS]] [[hospital]]s. The units are dedicated areas for teenage and young adult patients, who are involved in their concept and creation. Medical facilities on the units are  colourful and vibrant environments, equipped with computers, TVs, game consoles – designed to be places where friends and family feel comfortable to visit.

To date, the charity has built 25 units in [[London]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[Sheffield]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Manchester]], [[Glasgow]], [[Southampton]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Cardiff]], [[Bristol]], [[Cambridge]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leicester]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]].

The charity also serves as an advocate for teenage cancer needs, becoming instrumental in the establishment of related research and national and international forums.  It also provides support services and education related to teen cancer.

==History==
The idea for the charity grew by chance, out of the eagerness of a group of women to organise a fashion show to fund a children's intensive care heart unit at Guy's Hospital, London.  Established in 1990, the charity’s work has expanded dramatically. As well as an Education and Awareness team with a schools programme providing information, education and advice that reaches pupils all over the UK, the charity funds and organises a forum for professionals to ensure information and best practice sharing. It sponsors a teenage conference, Find Your Sense of Tumour, an International Conference on Cancer and the Adolescent and have just appointed the world’s first Professor of Adolescent Cancer Medicine. 

Each day in the UK, 6 teenagers will find out they have cancer. That is over 2,200 new diagnoses each year.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In many cases, cancer in teens is not picked up early enough and symptoms are dismissed as growing pains or sports injuries. Because teenagers are undergoing growth spurts, their cancers grow faster than other age groups and they can be at greater risk.

Cancer is the most common cause of non-accidental death in teens and young adults in the UK. By the age of 15 teens have a 1 in 600 chance of developing cancer. By the age of 24 young adults will have had a 1 in 285 chance of developing cancer. In the last 30 years the incidence of cancer in the teenage and young adult group has increased by 50% and for the first time ever, the number of teens with cancer now exceeds the number of children with cancer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
