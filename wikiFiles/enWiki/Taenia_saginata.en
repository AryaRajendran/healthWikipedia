'''''Taenia saginata''''', also known as '''''Taeniarhynchus saginata''''' or the '''beef tapeworm''', is a [[parasite]] of both [[cattle]] and humans, causing [[taeniasis]] in humans. ''Taenia saginata'' occurs where [[cattle]] are raised by infected humans maintaining poor [[hygiene]], human [[feces]] are improperly disposed of, meat inspection programs are poor, and where meat is eaten without proper cooking. The disease is relatively common in [[Africa]], some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Latin America]].<ref name="lange">Lange Microbiology, Chapter 46. Medical Parasitology.</ref>

==Description==
''T. saginata'' is normally 4 m to 10 m in length, but can become very large, over 12 m long in some situations. The body is whitish in colour, divided into the anterior [[scolex]], followed by a short neck and a highly extended body proper called the strobila. Unlike other [[tapeworms]], the [[scolex]] does not have a [[rostellum]] or scolex armature.  It is composed of four powerful [[Sucker (platyhelminth anatomy)|sucker]]s. The strobila is composed a series of ribbon-like segments called [[proglottid]]s. The segments are made up of mature and gravid proglottids. ''T. saginata'' is the largest of [[genus]] ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]'', consisting between 1000 to 2000 proglottids, and can also have a lifespan of 25 years in a host's intestine.<ref name="Bog">Bogitsh BJ, Carter CE (2005). ''Human Parasitology, 3rd Edition''. Academic Press, pp. 273-277. ISBN 0-12-088468-2</ref>  The mature proglottid contains the [[uterus]] (unbranched), [[ovary]], [[genital]] pore, [[testes]], and [[vitelline|vitelline gland]]. It does not have a [[digestive system]], mouth, [[anus]], or digestive tract.  It is also an [[acoelomate]], meaning it does not have a body cavity. In the [[gravid proglottid]], the uterus is branched and filled with eggs. The gravid segments detach and are passed in the feces. Each of these segments can act as a [[worm]]. When they dry up, the proglottid ruptures, and the eggs are released.  The egg can only infect [[cattle]], the [[intermediate host]]. Inside the cow's [[duodenum]], the oncosphere hatches with the help of the [[gastric secretion|gastric]] and [[intestinal secretion]]s, and migrates through the [[blood]] to the [[muscle]]. There it develops into infective [[cysticercoid cysticerci]].<ref name="schmidt">Roberts L, Janovy JrJ, Schmidt GD (2005). ''Foundations of Parasitology (8th edn).''

==Life cycle==
[[File:Taenia saginataD.JPG|thumb|'''Taenia saginata''' [[proglottid]] stained to show uterine branches.  The pore on the side identifies ''T. saginata'' as a [[cyclophyllid]] [[cestode]].]]

The [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] is indirect and complicated, and is completed in humans as the [[definitive host]] and cattle as the [[intermediate host]]. The adult worm inhabits the [[small intestine]] of humans. Fertilized eggs are released through the faeces along with the [[gravid proglottid]] which gets detached from the strobila. Cattle ingest the infective [[embryo]] while grazing. The [[digestive enzymes]] will break the thick shell of the egg and allow formation of the [[zygote]]s called "oncospheres". These zygotes then penetrate the [[mucus|mucous]] layer of the [[digestive system|digestive tract]] and enter the [[blood circulation|circulation]] of the host. This is where the young [[larva|larval stages]] form a pea-sized, fluid filled cyst, also known as “Cysticercus bovis” and these cysts seem to form in the muscular fibers and are sometimes seen in specific organs like the [[lungs]] and [[liver]]. Humans acquire the infective [[larva]]e from eating undercooked meat i.e.,measley beef. The [[digestive enzyme]]s break down the [[cysticercoid|cysticercus]] and the larval cyst is released and the inverted [[scolex]] is able to come out and attach to the host’s [[intestine]]. Adult [[tapeworm]] take about 2 months to develop, and within three months it can reach 5 m long.<ref name="Bog"/>

==Epidemiology==
The disease is relatively common in [[Africa]], some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Latin America]].<ref name="lange"/> Humans become infected when they eat undercooked beef.  Prevention is easy; cook beef until it is no longer pink inside and 56°C in the center, because this kills the cysticerci.  Also, beef frozen at -5°C is considered to be safe to consume.<ref name="schmidt"/>

This parasite is found anywhere where beef is eaten, even in countries such as the United States, with strict federal sanitation policies.  In the US, the incidence of infection is low, but 25% of infected cattle are still sold.<ref name="schmidt"/>

==Symptoms==
Tapeworms are usually [[asymptomatic]]. However heavy infection often results in weight loss, [[dizziness]], [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], [[headache]]s, [[nausea]], [[constipation]], or [[indigestion|chronic indigestion]], and loss of [[appetite]].  There can be intestinal obstruction in humans and this can be alleviated by surgery. The tapeworm can also expel [[antigen]]s that can cause an allergic reaction in the individual.<ref name="schmidt"/>

==Diagnosis==

The basic [[diagnosis]] is done from a stool sample. [[Feces]] are examined to find parasite eggs. The eggs look like other eggs from the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Taeniidae]], so it is only possible to identify the eggs to the family, not to the species level. Since it is difficult to diagnose using eggs alone, looking at the scolex or the gravid proglottids can help identify it as ''Taenia saginata''.<ref name="schmidt"/> Proglottids sometimes trickle down the thighs of infected humans and are visible with unaided eye, so can aid with identification. Observation of scolex help distinguish between ''T. saginata'', ''[[Taenia solium|T. solium]]'' and ''[[Taenia asiatica|T. asiatica]]''. When the [[uterus]] is injected with [[India ink]], its branches become visible. Counting the uterine branches enables some identification (''Taenia saginata'' uteri have 12 or more branches on each side, while other species such as ''[[Taenia solium]]'' only have five to 10).<ref name="lange"/>

Differentiation of the [[species]] from other species of ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]'', such as ''[[Taenia solium|T. solium]]'' and ''T. asiatica'', is notoriously difficult because of their close [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] resemblance, and their eggs are more or less identical. Identification often requires [[histology|histological]] observation of the [[uterus|uterine branches]] and [[PCR]] detection of [[ribosome|ribosomal 5.8S gene]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=González LM, Montero E, Harrison LJ, Parkhouse RM, Garate T. |title=Differential diagnosis of Taenia saginata and Taenia solium infection by PCR. |journal=J Clin Microbiol. |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=737–744 |year=2000 |pmid=10655377 |pmc=86191 }}</ref> ''T. saginata''’s [[uterus]]  stems out from its center to form 12 to 20 branches, but in contrast to its closely related ''Taenia'' species, the branches are much less in number and comparatively thicker; in addition, the [[ovary|ovaries]] are bilobed and [[testis|testes]] are twice as many.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zarlenga DS. |title=The differentiation of a newly described Asian taeniid from Taenia saginata using enzymatically amplified non-transcribed ribosomal DNA repeat sequences. |journal=Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health.  |volume=22 |issue=suppl |pages=251–255 |year=1991 |pmid=1822899 }}</ref>

[[Eosinophilia]] and elevated [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] levels are chief hematological findings.

==Treatment==
Treatment for [[cestode]] infection with the drug [[praziquantel]] opens membrane [[calcium channel]]s, causing [[paralysis]] of the worm, thus aiding the body in expelling the parasite through [[peristalsis]]. [[Niclosamide]], used to treat many different kinds of infections with [[trematodes]] and adult tapeworms, is also quite effective.

== Prevention ==

Adequate cooking (56°C for 5 minutes) of beef viscera destroys cysticerci. Refrigeration, freezing (-10°C for 9 days) or long period [[Salting (food)|salting]] is lethal to cysticerci. Inspection of beef and proper disposal of human excreta are also important measures.
