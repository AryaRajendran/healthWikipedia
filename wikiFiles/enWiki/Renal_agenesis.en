'''Renal agenesis''' is a medical condition in which one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) fetal [[kidney]]s fail to develop.

It can be associated with ''[[RET proto-oncogene|RET]]'' or ''[[UPK3A]]''.<ref>{{OMIM|191830}}</ref>

==Bilateral==
{{main|Potter sequence}}
Bilateral renal agenesis is the uncommon and serious failure of both a fetus' [[kidney]]s to develop during [[gestation]], and is one causative agent of [[Potter sequence]]. This absence of kidneys causes [[oligohydramnios]], a deficiency of amniotic fluid in a pregnant woman, which can place extra pressure on the developing baby and cause further malformations.  The condition is frequently, but not always the result of a [[genetic disorder]], and is more common in infants born to one or more parents with a malformed or absent kidney.  Males are more commonly affected and most infants that are born alive do not live beyond four hours.

==Unilateral renal agenesis==
This is much more common, but is not usually of any major health consequence, as long as the other kidney is healthy. It is associated with an increased incidence of [[mullerian duct]] abnormalities which are abnormalities of the development of the female reproductive tract and can be a cause of infertility.  The odds of a person being born with this condition are roughly 1 in 750. Adults with unilateral renal agenesis have considerably higher chances of hypertension (high blood pressure).  People with this condition are advised to approach contact sports with caution.
