The '''University of California, San Francisco''' ('''UCSF''') is a center of health sciences research, patient care, and education; located in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Though one of the ten campuses of the [[University of California]], it is unique for being the only University of California campus dedicated solely to graduate education, and in health and [[biomedical science]]s. Some of UCSF's treatment centers include [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]]s and [[liver transplantation]], [[radiology]], [[neurosurgery]], [[neurology]], [[oncology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[gene therapy]], [[women's health]], [[fetal surgery]], [[pediatrics]], and [[internal medicine]].

Founded in 1873, the mission of UCSF is to serve as a "public university dedicated to saving lives and improving health."  The UCSF Medical Center is consistently<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2011/07/10275/ucsf-medical-center-named-top-10-hospital-11th-consecutive-year| title =UCSF Medical Center Named Top 10 Hospital for 11th Consecutive Year |author=Karin Rush-Monroe |publisher=UCSF |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}</ref> ranked among the top 10 hospitals in the United States by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-hospitals/articles/2010/07/14/best-hospitals-2010-11-the-honor-roll |title=Best Hospitals 2011–12: the Honor Roll – US News and World Report |publisher=Health.usnews.com |date=July 18, 2011 |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> who also ranked UCSF’s medical school specialty program in [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome|AIDS]] medical care first in the country.

UCSF is administered separately from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|Hastings College of Law]], another [[University of California|UC]] institution located in San Francisco.  In recent years, UCSF and UC Hastings have increased their collaboration, including the formation of the UCSF/Hastings Consortium on Law, Science, and Health Policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uchastings.edu/academics/jd-program/law-science/law-science-health-policy.html |title=UCSF/Hastings Consortium |publisher=Uchastings.edu |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:UCSF 1908.jpg|thumb|UCSF in 1908, with the streetcar that used to run on Parnassus Avenue]]
