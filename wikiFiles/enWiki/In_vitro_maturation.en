'''In vitro maturation''' ('''IVM''') is the technique of letting [[ovarian follicle]]s mature [[in vitro]].

==Techniques available==
The ability of in IVM depends on how mature the follicle already is. There are several stages in [[folliculogenesis]], starting with a primordial follicle, which then becomes a primary, secondary, early tertiary ([[follicular antrum|antral]]), late tertiary and eventually a preovulatory follicle.
If a follicle has reached the early tertiary or antral stage, IVM can be carried out. A few live births have already been made<ref name=ncbi>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11255547&dopt=Citation NCBI:In vitro maturation of oocytes. Hardy K, Wright CS, Franks S, Winston RM]</ref> by taking small early tertiary follicles, letting them mature in vitro and subsequently [[fertilizing]] them.
However, for follicles that haven't reached the early tertiary stage, IVM is still under development. There are a lot of cellular changes in the [[oocyte]] and the rest of the cells in the follicle, which makes it very susceptible. Nevertheless, it is possible to let a primordial follicle mature to a secondary follicle outside the body by growing it in a slice of ovarian tissue.<ref name=ncbi/> The subsequent maturity from secondary to early tertiary stage can then be supported in test-tubes.<ref name=ncbi/>

IVM can be expanded with ''hCG-priming'', which is exposing the ovarian tissue to [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG). This results in an expanding or dispersed pattern of the [[cumulus oophorus]] around the egg cell, facilitating its identification within follicular fluid.<ref name=Son2010>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq014}}</ref> However, the evidence of a clinical effect of hCG priming is still lacking.<ref name=Son2010/> IVM can also be expanded with [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI), which should be performed at least one hour (and optimally two to four hours) after the first [[polar body]] extrusion.<ref name="Cha2007">

==Applications==
*Facilitate [[IVF]], and provide an alternative to [[ovulation induction]]. Before an IVF, an [[ovarian hyperstimulation]] is usually performed. By injecting gonadotropins, multiple oocytes will mature. Similar methods are applied in ovulation induction for other purposes. However, with IVM, injection of gonadotropins into the body isn't essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body, such as prior to IVF.<ref name=vejledning>[http://www.sst.dk/publ/Publ2006/KOT/kunstig_befrugtning/Vejl_ivf_oa_dec06.pdf Vejledning om kunstig befrugtning 2006 (Danish)]</ref> However, there still isn't enough evidence to prove the effectiveness and security of the technique.<ref name=vejledning/>

*For research. There are a million of oocytes in the ovary at birth, but only about 400 of these will be ovulated. The rest will die by [[Ovarian follicle atresia]]. When oocytes destined to die are extracted, IVM enables the maturation of these follicles. Thus, they can be studied to gather more information on folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation.<ref name=ncbi/>
