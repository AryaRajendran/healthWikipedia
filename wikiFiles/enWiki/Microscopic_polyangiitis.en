'''Microscopic polyangiitis''' (also known as "Microscopic polyarteritis,"<ref name="Bolognia" /> "Microscopic polyarteritis nodosa,"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book

 |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 }}</ref> "MPA"<ref name=FDA20110419/>) is an ill-defined [[autoimmune disease]] characterized by a systemic, [[pauci-immune]], necrotizing, small-vessel [[vasculitis]] without clinical or pathological evidence of necrotizing [[granulomatous]] [[inflammation]].

==Presentation==
Clinical features may include constitutional symptoms like fever, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and renal failure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Altaie R, Ditizio F, Fahy GT |title=Microscopic polyangitis presenting with sub-acute reversible optic neuropathy |journal=Eye (Lond) |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=363–5 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15272290 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701479 }}</ref> A majority of patients may have [[hematuria]] and [[proteinuria]]. [[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis]] may occur. Because many different organ systems may be involved, a wide range of symptoms are possible in MPA.

[[Purpura]] and [[livedo]] may be present.<ref name="pmid19059827">{{cite journal |author=Nagai Y, Hasegawa M, Igarashi N, Tanaka S, Yamanaka M, Ishikawa O |title=Cutaneous manifestations and histological features of microscopic polyangiitis |journal=Eur J Dermatol |volume= 19|issue= 1|pages= 57–60|year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19059827 |doi=10.1684/ejd.2008.0566 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Laboratory tests may reveal an increased [[sedimentation rate]], elevated [[CRP]], [[anemia]] and elevated creatinine due to renal impairment. An important diagnostic test is the presence of [[perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies]] (p-ANCA) with [[myeloperoxidase]] specificity<ref name="pmid15319159">{{cite journal |author=Seishima M, Oyama Z, Oda M |title=Skin eruptions associated with microscopic polyangiitis |journal=Eur J Dermatol |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=255–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15319159 |url=http://www.john-libbey-eurotext.fr/medline.md?issn=1167-1122&vol=14&iss=4&page=255}}</ref> (a constituent of [[neutrophil]] granules), and [[protein]] and red blood cells in the [[urine]].  

In patients with neuropathy, an EMG may reveal a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy.

==Cause==
While the mechanism of disease has yet to be fully elucidated, the leading hypothesis is that the process is begun with an autoimmune process of unknown etiology that triggers production of [[ANCA|p-ANCA]]. These antibodies will circulate at low levels until a pro-inflammatory trigger — such as infection, malignancy, or drug therapy. The trigger upregulates production of p-ANCA. Then, the large number of antibodies make it more likely that they will bind a neutrophil. Once bound, the neutrophil degranulates. The degranulation releases toxins that cause endothelial injury.<ref name="pmid12370273">{{cite journal |author=Xiao H, Heeringa P, Hu P, ''et al.'' |title=Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies specific for myeloperoxidase cause glomerulonephritis and vasculitis in mice |journal=J.

==Treatment==
The customary treatment involves long term dosage of [[prednisone]], alternated or combined with [[cytotoxic]] drugs, such as [[cyclophosphamide]] or [[azathioprine]]. 

[[Plasmapheresis]] may also be indicated in the acute setting to remove ANCA antibodies.
