The '''human gastrointestinal tract''' is the [[stomach]] and [[intestine]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000109945|gastrointestinal tract}}</ref> sometimes including all the structures from the [[human mouth|mouth]] to the [[anus]].<ref>{{MeshName|Gastrointestinal+tract}}</ref> (The "digestive system" is a broader term that includes other structures, including the [[accessory organs of digestion]]).<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952042|digestive system}}</ref>

In an [[adult]] [[male]] [[human]], the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is {{Convert|5|m|sigfig=1}} long in a live subject, or up to {{Convert|9|m|sigfig=1}} without the effect of [[muscle tone]], and consists of the upper and lower GI tracts. The tract may also be divided into [[foregut]], [[midgut]], and [[hindgut]], reflecting the [[embryology|embryological]] origin of each segment of the tract.

The GI tract always releases [[hormone]]s to help regulate the digestive process. These hormones, including [[gastrin]], [[secretin]], [[cholecystokinin]], and [[grehlin]], are mediated through either [[intracrine]] or [[autocrine]] mechanisms, indicating that the cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout [[evolution]].<ref>Nelson RJ. 2005. Introduction to [[Neuroendocrinology | Behavioral Endocrinology]]. Sinauer Associates: Massachusetts. p 57.</ref>

==Upper gastrointestinal tract==
{{Digestive system diagram}} <!--To edit, search for Template:Digestive system diagram

The upper gastrointestinal tract consists of the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]], and [[duodenum]].<ref>{{MeshName|Upper+Gastrointestinal+Tract}}</ref>
The exact demarcation between "upper" and "lower" can vary. Upon [[dissection]], the duodenum may appear to be a unified organ, but it is often divided into two parts based upon function, arterial supply, or embryology.

==Lower gastrointestinal tract==
The lower gastrointestinal tract includes most of the [[small intestine]] and all of the [[large intestine]].<ref>{{MeSH name|Lower+Gastrointestinal+Tract}}</ref> According to some sources, it also includes the [[anus]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

*[[Bowel]] or [[intestine]]
**[[Small Intestine]]: Has three parts:
***[[Duodenum]]: Here the digestive juices from the [[pancreas]] ([[digestive enzymes]]) and hormones and the [[gall bladder]] ([[bile]]) mix. The digestive enzymes break down proteins and bile and [[emulsify]] fats into [[micelles]]. The [[duodenum]] contains [[Brunner's glands]] which produce bicarbonate. In combination with bicarbonate from pancreatic juice, this neutralizes [[HCl]] of the stomach.
***[[Jejunum]]: This is the midsection of the intestine, connecting the duodenum to the ileum. It contains the [[plicae circulares]], and [[intestinal villus|villi]] to increase the surface area of that part of the GI Tract. Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids, fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream.
***[[Ileum]]: Has [[intestinal villus|villi]] and absorbs mainly [[vitamin B12]] and [[bile acids]], as well as any other remaining nutrients.
**[[Large Intestine]]: Has three parts:
***[[Caecum]]: The [[Vermiform appendix]] is attached to the [[caecum]].
***[[Colon (anatomy)|Colon]]:  Includes the [[ascending colon]], [[transverse colon]], [[descending colon]] and [[sigmoid Flexure]]: The main function of the Colon is to absorb water, but it also contains [[bacteria]] that produce beneficial [[vitamin]]s like [[vitamin K]].
***[[Rectum]]
*[[Anus]]: Passes [[fecal matter]] from the body.

The [[Ligament of Treitz]] is sometimes used to divide the upper and lower GI tracts.<ref name="Warrell2005">{{cite book|author=David A. Warrell|title=Oxford textbook of medicine: Sections 18-33|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hL1NKQJlY1IC&pg=PA511|accessdate=1 July 2010|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856978-7|pages=511–}}</ref>

==Embryology==
The [[gut (anatomy)|gut]] is an [[endoderm]]-derived structure. At approximately the sixteenth day of human development, the [[embryo]] begins to fold [[ventral]]ly (with the embryo's ventral surface becoming [[concave polygon|concave]]) in two directions: the sides of the embryo fold in on each other and the head and tail fold toward one another. The result is that a piece of the [[yolk sac]], an [[endoderm]]-lined structure in contact with the [[ventral]] aspect of the embryo, begins to be pinched off to become the primitive gut. The yolk sac remains connected to the gut tube via the [[vitelline duct]]. Usually this structure regresses during development; in cases where it does not, it is known as [[Meckel's diverticulum]].

During [[fetus|fetal]] life, the primitive gut can be divided into three segments: [[foregut]], [[midgut]], and [[hindgut]]. Although these terms are often used in reference to segments of the primitive gut, they are also used regularly to describe components of the definitive gut as well.

Each segment of the gut gives rise to specific gut and gut-related structures in later development. Components derived from the gut proper, including the [[stomach]] and [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], develop as swellings or dilatations of the primitive gut. In contrast, gut-related derivatives — that is, those structures that derive from the primitive gut but are not part of the gut proper, in general develop as out-pouchings of the primitive gut. The blood vessels supplying these structures remain constant throughout development.<ref>{{cite book | author = Bruce M.

==Transit time==
The time taken for food or other ingested objects to transit through the gastrointestinal tract varies depending on many factors, but roughly, it takes less than an hour after a meal for 50% of stomach contents to empty into the intestines and total emptying of the stomach takes around 2 hours. Subsequently, 50% emptying of the small intestine takes 1 to 2 hours. Finally, transit through the colon takes 12 to 50 hours with wide variation between individuals.<ref>Kim SK. Small intestine transit time in the normal small bowel study.

==Pathology==
{{Main|Digestive disease}}
There are a number of diseases and conditions affecting the gastrointestinal system, including:
*[[Appendicitis]]
*[[Cancer]]
*[[Celiac Disease]]
*[[Cholera]]
*[[Colorectal cancer]]
*[[Diarrhoea]]
*[[Diverticulitis]]
*[[Enteric duplication cyst]]
*[[Gastroenteritis]], also known as "stomach flu"; an inflammation of the stomach and intestines
*[[Giardiasis]]
*[[Inflammatory bowel disease]] (including [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]])
*[[Irritable bowel syndrome]]
*[[Pancreatitis]]
*[[Peptic ulcer disease]]
*[[Yellow Fever]]

==Immune function==
The gastrointestinal tract is also a prominent part of the [[immune system]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Richard Coico, Geoffrey Sunshine, Eli Benjamini | title = Immunology: a short course | publisher = Wiley-Liss | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-471-22689-0}}</ref> The surface area of the digestive tract is estimated to be the surface area of a football field. With such a large exposure, the immune system must work hard to prevent pathogens from entering into blood and lymph.<ref>Animal Physiology textbook</ref>

The low [[pH]] (ranging from 1 to 4) of the stomach is fatal for many [[microorganism]]s that enter it. Similarly, [[mucus]] (containing [[IgA]] [[antibodies]]) neutralizes many of these microorganisms. Other factors in the GI tract help with immune function as well, including [[enzyme]]s in [[saliva]] and [[bile]]. [[Enzyme]]s such as Cyp3A4, along with the antiporter activities, also are instrumental in the intestine's role of detoxification of [[antigen]]s and [[xenobiotic]]s, such as drugs, involved in [[first pass metabolism]].

Health-enhancing [[Gut flora|intestinal bacteria]] serve to prevent the overgrowth of potentially harmful [[bacteria]] in the gut. These two types of bacteria compete for space and "food," as there are limited resources within the intestinal tract. A ratio of 80-85% beneficial to 15-20% potentially harmful bacteria generally is considered normal within the intestines. Microorganisms also are kept at bay by an extensive immune system comprising the [[gut-associated lymphoid tissue]] (GALT).

==Histology==
[[File:Gut wall.svg|thumb|right|250px|General structure of the gut wall]]
The gastrointestinal tract has a form of general histology with some differences that reflect the specialization in functional anatomy.<ref>{{cite book | author = Abraham L. Kierszenbaum | title = Histology and cell biology: an introduction to pathology | publisher = Mosby | location = St. Louis | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-323-01639-1}}</ref> The GI tract can be divided into four concentric layers in the following order:
* [[Mucosa]]
* [[Submucosa]]
* ''[[Muscularis externa]]'' (the external muscular layer)
* [[Adventitia]] or [[serosa]]

===Mucosa===
The mucosa is the innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract. that is surrounding the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], or open space within the tube. This layer comes in direct contact with digested food ([[chyme]]),

The mucosa is made up of three layers:
* Epithelium - innermost layer. Responsible for most digestive, absorptive and secretory processes.
* Lamina propria - a layer of connective tissue. Unusually cellular compared to most connective tissue
* Muscularis mucosae - a thin layer of smooth muscle. Function is still under debate

The mucosae are highly specialized in each organ of the gastrointestinal tract to deal with the different conditions. The most variation is seen in the epithelium. 

In the esophagus, the epithelium is stratified, squamous and non-keratinising, for protective purposes.

In the stomach it is simple columnar, and is organised into gastric pits and glands to deal with secretion. The [[gastro-oesophageal junction]] is extremely abrupt.

The small intestine epithelium (particularly the [[ileum]]) is specialised for absorption; it is organised into plicae circulares and villi, and the enterocytes have microvilli. This creates a brush border which greatly increases the surface area for absoption. The epithelium is simple columnar with microvilli. In the ileum there are occasionally [[Peyer's patch]]es in the lamina propria.

The colon has simple columnar epithelium with no villi. There are goblet cells. 

The appendix has a mucosa resembling the colon but is heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes.

The ano-rectal junction (at the [[pectinate line]]) is again very abrupt; there is a transition from simple columnar to stratified squamous non-keratinising epithelium (as in the oesophagus) for protective purposes.

===Submucosa===<!-- This section is linked from [[Intestine]] -->
The submucosa consists of a dense irregular layer of connective tissue with large blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscularis externa. It contains [[Meissner's plexus]], an [[enteric nervous system|enteric nervous plexus]], situated on the inner surface of the ''muscularis externa''.

===Muscularis externa===<!-- This section is linked from [[Intestine]] -->
The muscularis externa consists of an inner circular layer and a [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] outer muscular layer. The circular muscle layer prevents food from traveling backward and the longitudinal layer shortens the tract. The layers are not truly longitudinal or circular, rather the layers of muscle are helical with different pitches. The inner circular is helical with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is helical with a much shallower pitch. 

The coordinated contractions of these layers is called [[peristalsis]] and propels the food through the tract. Food in the GI tract is called a bolus (ball of food) from the mouth down to the stomach. After the stomach, the food is partially digested and semi-liquid, and is referred to as [[chyme]]. In the large intestine the remaining semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces.

Between the two muscle layers are the myenteric or [[Auerbach's plexus]]. This controls peristalsis. Activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells ([[interstitial cells of Cajal]]). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity ([[basal electrical rhythm]]) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can of course be modulated by the rest of the [[autonomic nervous system]].

The thickness of muscularis externa varies in each part of the tract. In the colon, for example, the muscularis externa is much thicker because the faeces are large and heavy, and require more force to push along. The outer longitudinal layer of the colon thins out into 3 discontinuous longitudinal bands, known as tiniae coli (bands of the colon). This is one of the 3 features helping to distinguish between the large and small intestine.

Occasionally in the large intestine (2-3 times a day) there will be mass contraction of certain segments, moving a lot of faeces along. This is generally when one gets the urge to defecate.

The pylorus of the stomach has a thickened portion of the inner circular layer: the [[pyloric sphincter]]. Alone among the GI tract, the stomach has a third layer of muscularis externa. This is the inner oblique layer, and helps churn the chyme in the stomach.

===Adventitia/serosa===
The outermost layer of the GI tract consists of several layers of [[connective tissue]].

Intraperitoneal parts of the GI tract are covered with [[serosa]]. These include most of the [[stomach]], first part of the [[duodenum]], all of the [[small intestine]], [[caecum]] and [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], [[transverse colon]], [[sigmoid colon]] and [[rectum]]. In these sections of the gut there is clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue. These parts of the tract have a [[mesentery]].

[[Retroperitoneal]] parts are covered with [[adventitia]]. They blend in to the surrounding tissue and are fixed in position. For example, the retroperitoneal section of the duodenum usually passes through the [[transpyloric plane]]. These include the [[oesophagus]], [[pylorus]] of the stomach, distal [[duodenum]], [[ascending colon]], [[descending colon]] and [[anal canal]]. In addition, the [[human mouth|oral cavity]] has adventitia.
