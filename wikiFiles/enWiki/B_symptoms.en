'''B symptoms''' refer to [[:wikt:systemic|systemic]] symptoms of [[fever]], [[night sweat]]s, and [[weight loss]] which can be associated with both [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. The presence or absence of B symptoms has prognostic significance and is reflected in the [[cancer staging|staging]] of these [[lymphoma]]s.

==Description and nomenclature==

B symptoms are so called because [[Ann Arbor staging]] of lymphomas includes both a number (I-IV) and a letter (A or B);.<ref name="pmid5121694">{{cite journal |author=Carbone PP, Kaplan HS, Musshoff K, Smithers DW, Tubiana M |title=Report of the Committee on Hodgkin's Disease Staging Classification |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=1860–1 |year=1971 |month=November |pmid=5121694 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=5121694}}</ref> "A" indicates the absence of systemic symptoms, while "B" indicates their presence.

B symptoms include:
* Fever greater than 38°C. [[Pel-Ebstein fever]], the classic intermittent fever associated with Hodgkin disease, occurs at variable intervals of days to weeks and lasts for 1–2 weeks before resolving. However, fever associated with lymphoma can follow virtually any pattern.
* Drenching sweats, especially at night.
* Unintentional weight loss of >10% of normal body weight over a period of 6 months or less.

==Prognostic importance==

The presence of B symptoms is a marker for more advanced disease with systemic, rather than merely local, involvement. B symptoms are a clear negative [[prognosis|prognostic factor]] in Hodgkin lymphoma.<ref>Reevaluation of prognostic significance of symptoms in Hodgkin's disease.

===Relative importance of specific B symptoms===
It has been suggested that, in Hodgkin lymphoma, fever and weight loss are much more prognostically significant than night sweats. In one series of patients with early-stage Hodgkin disease, the presence or absence of night sweats had no impact on cure rates and outcome. However, fever and weight loss had a pronounced negative impact on cure and survival rates, regardless of treatment modality.<ref>Stage I to IIB Hodgkin's disease: the combined experience at Stanford University and the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy.

=="B symptoms" in other diseases==

Similar systemic symptoms can be found in non-cancerous states such as [[tuberculosis]] and various [[inflammation|inflammatory]] or [[rheumatology|rheumatologic]] conditions. In these settings, the term "B symptoms" is sometimes colloquially applied to refer to such systemic or [[constitutional symptoms]]. However, in a pure sense, the term "B symptoms" is restricted to lymphoma staging.
