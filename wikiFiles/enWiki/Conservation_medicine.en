'''Conservation medicine''' is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that studies the relationship between [[human]] and [[animal]] [[health]], and  [[natural environment|environment]]al conditions. Also known as '''ecological medicine''', '''environmental medicine''', or '''medical geology'''.

The environmental causes of health problems are complex, global, and poorly understood. Conservation medicine practitioners form multidisciplinary teams to tackle these issues. Teams may involve [[physician]]s and [[veterinarian]]s working alongside [[researcher]]s and [[clinician]]s from diverse disciplines, including [[microbiology|microbiologists]], [[pathology|pathologists]], [[landscape]] analysts, [[marine biology|marine biologists]], [[toxicology|toxicologists]], [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[climate]] biologists, [[anthropology|anthropologists]], [[economics|economists]], and [[political science|political scientists]].

Clinical areas include [[HIV]], [[Lyme disease]], [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] (SARS), [[avian influenza]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Malaria]], [[Nipah virus]], and other emerging [[infectious disease]]s.  

The term ''conservation medicine'' was first used in the mid-1990s, and represents a significant [[paradigm]] shift in both [[medicine]] and [[environmentalism]]. While the hands-on process in individual cases is complicated, the underlying concept of interrelationships is quite intuitive, namely, that all things{{vague|date=February 2012}} are related. The threat of [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] diseases&mdash;cross-[[species]] diseases that travel to humans from other animals&mdash;is central. For example, burning huge areas of [[forest]] to make way for farmland is normally seen as an environmental and economic concern. That action may displace a wild animal species, which comes into contact with and infects a domesticated animal species, creating a veterinary problem. The domesticated animal then enters the human food chain and infects people, and a new health threat emerges. Conventional approaches to environmental protection and animal and human health only as an exception examine these connections, whereas in conservation medicine, such relationships are fundamental. Professionals from the many disciplines involved, who usually operate in well-separated spheres, necessarily work closely together.

==Social impact==

By looking at the environment and health as a continuum, conservation medicine has the potential to effect rapid change in public opinion on complex societal issues, by making the distant and ill-defined, local and pressing. For instance, [[global warming]] may have vaguely defined long-term impacts, but when an immediate effect is a relatively slight rise in air [[temperature]], which in turn raises the flight ceiling for temperature-sensitive [[mosquito]]es, allowing them to infect higher flying migratory [[bird]]s, which in turn carry a disease from one country or continent to another, the issue becomes more real. Likewise, the broad topic of [[suburban sprawl]] is made more relevant when seen in terms of the immediate imbalance it brings to rural ecosystems, which increases population densities and forces humans into closer contact with, certain animals (like [[rodent]]s), increasing the risk of new cross-species diseases. When tied to actual cases (like SARS or HIV/AIDS), this holistic outlook seems likely to resonate more powerfully with the public than the more abstract explanations of environmental and health issues that are currently common.
