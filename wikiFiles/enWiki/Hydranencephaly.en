'''Hydranencephaly''' is a condition where the brain cerebral hemispheres are absent and replaced by sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid.<ref>http://www.disabled-world.com/health/neurology/hydranencephaly.php</ref>

Hydranencephaly (or hydroanencephaly)<ref name="National Organization for Rare Disorders">{{cite web|last=National Organization for Rare Disorders|title=Hydranencephaly|url=http://www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/rare-diseases/byID/369/viewFullReport|work=Rare Diseases Information}}</ref> is a type of [[cephalic disorder]]. 
These disorders are congenital conditions that derive from either damage to, or abnormal development of, the fetal nervous system in the earliest stages of development in utero. Cephalic is the medical term for “head” or “head end of body.” These conditions do not have any definitive identifiable cause factor; instead generally attributed to a variety of hereditary or genetic conditions, but also by environmental factors such as maternal infection, pharmaceutical intake, or even exposure to high levels of radiation.<ref name="National Institute of Neurological Conditions and Stroke">{{cite web|last=National Institute of Neurological Conditions and Stroke|first=NINDS|title=Hydranencephaly Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydranencephaly/hydranencephaly.htm|work=Disorders}}</ref>  

This is a rare condition in which the cerebral hemispheres are absent and replaced by sacs filled with [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. 

This should not be confused with '''[[hydrocephalus]]''', which is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles.

In [[hemihydranencephaly]], only half of the brain is filled with fluid.<ref name="pmid15995064">{{cite journal |author=Ulmer S, Moeller F, Brockmann MA, Kuhtz-Buschbeck JP, Stephani U, Jansen O |title=Living a normal life with the nondominant hemisphere: magnetic resonance imaging findings and clinical outcome for a patient with left-hemispheric hydranencephaly |journal=Pediatrics |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=242–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15995064 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-0425}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Usually the cerebellum and brainstem are formed normally, although in some cases the cerebellum may also be absent. An infant with hydranencephaly may appear normal at birth or may have some distortion of the skull and upper facial features due to fluid pressure inside the skull. The infant's head size and spontaneous reflexes such as sucking, swallowing, crying, and moving the [[arm]]s and [[leg]]s may all seem normal, depending on the severity of the condition. However, after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased [[muscle]] tone ([[hypertonia]]). After several months of life, [[seizure]]s and [[hydrocephalus]] may develop. Other symptoms may include visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, spastic quadriparesis ([[paralysis]]), and intellectual deficits. 

Some infants may have additional abnormalities at birth including seizures, [[myoclonus]] (involuntary sudden, rapid jerks), and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] problems.

Still other infants display no obvious symptoms at birth, going many months without a confirmed diagnosis of hydranencephaly. In some cases a severe hydrocephalus, or other cephalic conditions, diagnosis is misdiagnosed.

==Causes==
Hydranencephaly is an extreme form of [[porencephaly]], which is characterized by a cyst or cavity in the cerebral hemispheres.

Although the exact cause of hydranencephaly remains undetermined in most cases, the most likely general cause is by vascular insult such as stroke or injury, intrauterine infections, or traumatic disorders after the first trimester of pregnancy. In a number of cases where intrauterine infection was determined the causing factor, most involved toxoplasmosis and viral infections such as enterovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, cytomegalic, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, and syncytial viruses. Another cause factor is determined to be monochorionic twin pregnancies, involving the death of one twin in the second trimester, which in turn causes vascular exchange to the living twin through placental circulation through twin-to-twin transfusion, causing hydranencephaly in the surviving fetus.<ref name="Kurtz & Johnson">{{cite web|last=Kurtz & Johnson|first=Alfred & Pamela|title=Case Number 7: Hydranencephaly|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/210/2/419.full#ref-3|work=Radiology, 210, 419-422}}</ref> One medical journal reports hydranencephaly as an autosomal inherited disorder with an unknown mode of transmission, where an unknown blockage of the carotid artery where it enters the cranium causes obstruction and damage to the cerebral cortex.<ref name="National Organization for Rare Disorders"/> 

As a recessive genetic condition, both parents must carry the asymptomatic gene and pass it along to their child, a chance of roughly 25 percent. Despite determination of cause, hydranencephaly inflicts both males and females in equal numbers.

Though hydranencephaly is typically a congenital disorder, it can occur as a postnatal diagnosis in the aftermath of meningitis, intracerebral infarction, and ischemia (stroke), or other traumatic brain injury.<ref name="Dubey">{{cite web|last=Dubey|first=AK Lt Col|title=Is it Hydranencephaly-A Variant?|url=http://medind.nic.in/maa/t02/i4/maat02i4p338g.PDF|work=MJAFI 2002; 58:338-339|accessdate=2011}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] may be delayed for several months because the infant's early behavior appears to be relatively normal. [[Transillumination]], an examination in which [[light]] is passed through body tissues, can be used to diagnose hydranencephaly. An accurate, confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth, though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography (ultrasound) can identify characteristic physical abnormalities that exist. Through thorough clinical evaluation, via physical findings, detailed patient history, and advanced imaging techniques, such as angiogram, computerized tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or more rarely transillumination (shining of bright light through the skull) after birth are the most accurate diagnostic techniques.<ref name="National Organization for Rare Disorders"/> However, diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between severe obstructive hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly, leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis.<ref name="Dubey"/>

Preliminary diagnosis may be made in utero via standard ultrasound, and can be confirmed with a standard anatomy ultrasound. This sometimes proves to provide a misdiagnosis of differential diagnoses including bilaterally symmetric schizencephaly (a less destructive developmental process on the brain), severe hydrocephalus (cerebrospinal fluid excess within the skull), and alobar holoprosencephaly (a neurological developmental anomaly). Once destruction of the brain is complete, the cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees. Though the cerebral cortex is absent, in most cases the fetal head remains enlarged due to the continued production by the choroid plexus of cerebrospinal fluid that is inadequately reabsorbed causing increased intracranial pressure.<ref name="Kurtz & Johnson"/>

==Occurrence==
This condition possesses isolated occurrences, affecting less than 1 in 10,000 births worldwide<ref name="Kurtz & Johnson"/> and officially classifying hydranencephaly as a rare disorder by affecting fewer than 1 in 200,000 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rare Disease Day: February 28|title=What is  a Rare Disease?|url=http://www.rarediseaseday.org/article/what-is-a-rare-disease|work=Rare Disease|accessdate=2011}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
There is no standard treatment for hydranencephaly. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Hydrocephalus may be treated with a [[shunt (medical)|shunt]].

The prognosis for children with hydranencephaly is generally quite poor.  Death usually occurs in the first year of life.<ref name="pmid10963978">{{cite journal |author=McAbee GN, Chan A, Erde EL |title=Prolonged survival with hydranencephaly: report of two patients and literature review |journal=Pediatr. Neurol. |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=80–4 |year=2000 |pmid=10963978|doi=10.1016/S0887-8994(00)00154-5}}</ref> 

Medical text identifies that hydranencephalic children simply have only their brain stem function remaining, thus leaving formal treatment options as symptomatic and supportive.<ref name="Kurtz & Johnson"/> Severe hydrocephalus causing macrocephaly, a larger than average head circumference, can easily be managed by placement of a shunt<ref name="National Institute of Neurological Conditions and Stroke"/>   and oftentimes displays a misdiagnosis of another lesser variation of cephalic condition due to the blanketing nature of hydrocephalus.<ref name="Kurtz & Johnson"/> Plagiocephaly, the asymmetrical distortion of the skull, is another typical associated condition that is easily managed through positioning and strengthening exercises to prevent torticollis, a constant spasm or extreme tightening of the neck muscles.
