== History ==
{{see also|Twelve-step program#History |l1=Twelve-step program: History}}

The first meetings began in February 1982 in [[Southern California]] by several [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA) members to focus specifically on smoking cessation. These AA members began meeting under the name Smokers Anonymous in [[Los Angeles]], shortly thereafter another group independently started in [[San Francisco]]. In 1986 the group members met for their first conference  in [[Bakersfield, California]] to form a fellowship, originally known as ''Smokers Anonymous'', later changing the name to Nicotine Anonymous as the Smokers Anonymous trademark was not available. In 2000, "NicA" was selected to abbreviate Nicotine Anonymous at the annual World Service Conference.<ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/><ref name="NICASITEHIST">{{cite web |title =  A Brief History of Nicotine Anonymous | format = PDF | author = Nicotine Anonymous | accessdate = 2007-09-18 | url = http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/admin/prod_images/Brief%20History%20of%20Nicotine%20Anonymousrevised.pdf}}</ref>

== Structure ==
Adapted with permission of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] World Services, Inc., the [[Twelve Traditions]] are utilized by Nicotine Anonymous as fundamental guiding principles. Nicotine Anonymous operates with an elected, all volunteer, nine member National Board of Directors and a set of [[by-laws]]. The Board meets regularly to discuss how to be of service to the organization including organizing the NicA annual conference and monitoring the NicA national clearing house, Nicotine Anonymous World Services, located in Dallas, TX. The NicA clearing house keeps regularly updating meeting lists, manages the website, and serves as a resource for members or any interested smoker.<ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/> There are no dues or fees for NicA membership, as stated in Tradition Three: "the only requirement for Nicotine Anonymous membership is a desire to stop using nicotine."<ref name="NICATRADITIONS">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/pubs_content.php?pub_id=19 |title=Nicotine Anonymous Publications, Literature and Pamphlets |accessdate=2008-05-01 |date=2008-05-01 |author=Nicotine Anonymous |publisher=Nicotine Anonymous World Services}}</ref>

== Comparison ==
There are several commercial and nonprofit programs supporting smoking cessation programs in the United States. Low-cost options, in addition to Nicotine Anonymous, are sponsored by groups such as The [[American Cancer Society]], The [[American Lung Association]], The [[American Heart Association]] and The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Commercial programs include cognitive-behavioral group therapy, [[nicotine replacement therapy|nicotine replacement therapies]] and [[bupropion]]. Combinations of these approaches, marketed in commercial packages such as Smokeless and Smoke Stoppers, are licensed to treatment providers and conducted on an inpatient or outpatient basis. These are in addition to local programs ran by regional treatment facilities.<ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/><ref name="GREEN2003">{{cite journal |last=Green |first=Amanda |coauthors=Yancy, William S.; Braxton, Loretta; Westman, Eric C. |title=Residential Smoking Therapy |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=275–280 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.2003.11114.x |month=April |year=2003 |pmid=12709094 |pmc=1494850}}</ref>

NicA is unique among the array of treatment options as its meetings are held weekly, nicotine users and ex-nicotine users can leave and enter the process as they please. Most other treatment programs are run episodically, making it difficult for members to pick it up midway through or begin when a program is not being offered.<ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/>
 
In 1996, NicA ranked twelfth in size among the thirteen twelve-step organizations studied by Klaus Makela.<ref name="MAKELA1996">{{cite book |last=Makela |first=Klaus |title=Alcoholics Anonymous as a Mutual-help Movement: A Study in Eight Societies |year=1996 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |isbn=0-299-15004-6}}</ref> Sponsorship and lifetime attendance is not emphasized as much as in as in other [[twelve-step program]]s. The average meeting size is about seven people.<ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/>

Although both drinking and smoking are recognized by many respondents as imposing burdens on the family,<ref name="ROBIN1996">{{cite journal |last=Robin |first=Room |title=Patterns of family responses to alcohol and tobacco problems |journal=Drugs and Alcohol Review |volume=15 |issue=2 |month=June |year=1996 |pages=171–181 |doi=10.1080/09595239600185821 |pmid=16203367}}</ref> there are no auxiliary support groups for friends and family of smokers related to NicA; as [[Al-Anon]] meetings were created for friends and family members of [[alcoholics]]. Nicotine Anonymous World Services does, however, offer a pamphlet, ''Are You Concerned About Someone Who Smokes or Chews Tobacco?'' with information for friends and family of nicotine users.<ref name="NICAPUBS">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/pubs_content.php?pub_id=7 |title=Nicotine Anonymous Publications, Literature and Pamplets (sic) |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

== Effectiveness ==

Success in achieving smoking abstinence using current smoking therapies such as Nicotine Anonymous, cognitive-behavioral group therapy, nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion (Zyban) ranges from 9% to 40% in different studies.<ref name="GREEN2003"/> Alcoholics and drug addicts have better smoking cessation success rates when attempting to quit smoking early in recovery. <ref name="SUSSMAN2002">{{cite journal | last = Sussman | first = S. | title = Smoking cessation among persons in recovery |  journal = Substance Use and Misuse | volume = 37 | issue = 8 – 10 | year = 2002 | pages = 1275–1298 | pmid = 12180567 | issn = 1082-6084 | doi = 10.1081/JA-120004185}}</ref> Combining psychosocial and pharmacological treatments increases smoking cessation success rates.<ref name="HUGHES2003">{{cite journal | last = Hughes | first = John R. | title = Motivating and Helping Smokers to Stop Smoking | journal = Journal of General Internal Medicine | issn = 0884-8734 | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | month = December | year = 2003 | pages = 1053–1057 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2003.20640.x | pmid = 14687265 | pmc = 1494968}}</ref> Acupuncture, hypnosis, inpatient treatment, and Nicotine Anonymous have not been shown effective thus far.<ref name="FIORE2000">{{cite book |last=Fiore |first=Michael C. |coauthors=Bailey, William C.; Cohen, Stuart J.; Dorfman, Sally Faith; Goldstein, Michael G.; Gritz, Ellen R.; Heyman, Richard B.; Jaén, Carlos Roberto; Kottke, Thomas E.; Lando, Harry A.; Mecklenburg, Robert E.; Mullen, Patricia Dolan; Nett, Louise M.; Robinson, Lawrence; Stitzer, Maxine L.; Tommasello, Anthony C.; Villejo, Louise; Wewers, Mary Ellen |title=Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: Clinical Practice Guideline |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service |month=June |year=2000 |location=[[Rockville, MD]] |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=hstat2.chapter.7644}}</ref>

In a controlled study 205 alcoholics, with heavy tobacco dependence (an average of 26.8 cigarettes per day) and three months or more of continuous abstinence from drugs and alcohol, were placed at random in one of three treatment groups: an American Lung Association Quit Program plus Nicotine Anonymous meetings group, a behavioral counseling plus physical exercise group, or a behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group.  The effectiveness of the treatment programs was measured at post-treatment, six months, and twelve-months following post-treatment based on self-reports confirmed by confirmed biochemical and informant reports. Immediately following treatment the behavior counseling and exercise group had the highest quit percentage (60%) followed by the behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group, with the ALA quit program plus NicA group at 31%. At the six-month follow up all groups had similar percentages of members maintaining abstinence from tobacco (29%, 27%, and 21%, respectively) and also at twelve-months (27%, 27%, and 26%, respectively). Out of all the participants, only 4% relapsed on alcohol or drugs. The alcohol relapse rate did not differ by treatment group.<ref name="MARTIN1997">{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=M.E. |coauthors=Calfas, K.J.; Patten, C.A.; Polarek, M.; Hofstetter, C.R.; Noto, J.; Beach, D. |title=Prospective evaluation of three smoking interventions in 205 recovering alcoholics: one-year results of Project SCRAP-Tobacco |journal=Journal of Consulting and  Clinical Psychology |issn=1939-2117 |year=1997 |month=February |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=190–194 |pmid=9103749 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.65.1.190}}</ref>

=== Demographics ===
In a survey of 104 smokers (ages 18 an older) 78% reported they believed spiritual resources could be helpful in an attempt to quit smoking. In the same survey, male smokers, ages 31 and over, and females were found to be significantly more open to using spiritual resources in the smoking cessation process than controls. Heavy smokers, those smoking more than fifteen cigarettes per day, were also significantly more receptive to encouragement of spiritual resources in an attempt to quit.<ref name="GONZALES2007">{{cite journal | last = Gonzales | first = David | coauthors = Redtomahawk, Donovan; Pizacani, Barbara; Bjornson, Wendy G.; Spradley, Janet; Allen, Elizabeth; Lees, Paul | year = 2007 | month = February | pages = 299–303 | doi = 10.1080/14622200601078582 | journal = Nicotine & Tobacco Research | title = Support for spirituality in smoking cessation: Results of pilot survey | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a770733791~db=all | volume = 9 | pmid = 17365761 | issue = 2}}</ref>

===Analysis===
A NicA pamphlet, ''Tips for Gaining Freedom from Nicotine'', was reviewed in 1999 by a [[Sampling (statistics)#Convenience_sampling|convenience sample]] of twelve professional colleagues of psychologist Edward Lichtenstein. These professionals were asked to review the cessation tips from the pamphlet and rate them on whether they were cognitive, behavioral, or neither. To that extent, they also rated how consistent the tips were with current cognitive-behavioral cessation techniques. It was found that many of the tips were very consistent with modern cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment programs. The cognitive behavioral tips included setting dates, making commitments, planning things to keep one's mind of smoking, having something to fidget with, having something to put in one's mouth, rewarding oneself when goals has been met, remembering that discomfort associated with withdrawal will subside within two weeks. Other tips were found to be spiritual or exhortational such as: "Remember, every minute you were sucking on cigarettes they were sucking on you," or "Don't say, I'll take my chances' and continue to smoke. They are not ours to take ... that is up to God."<ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/> Since 1999 many of the NicA pamphlets have been updated and current versions may not contain the information analyzed.<ref name="NICAPUBS"/>
