'''Toxocariasis''' is an illness of humans caused by a [[larvae]] (immature worms) of either the dog [[roundworm]] (''[[Toxocara canis]]''), the cat roundworm (''[[Toxocara cati]]'') or the fox (''[[Toxocara canis]]''). Toxocariasis is often called visceral larva migrans (VLM). Depending on geographic location, degree of [[eosinophilia]], eye and/or pulmonary signs the terms [[human eye|ocular]] larva migrans (OLM), [[Weingarten's disease]], [[Frimodt-Moller]]'s syndrome, and eosiniphilic pseudoleukemia <ref name="afip.org">Marty, Aileen.

Other terms sometimes or rarely used include nematode opthalmitis, toxocaral disease, toxocarose, and covert toxocariasis,<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/>).  This [[zoonotic]], [[helminth]]ic infection is a major cause of blindness and may provoke [[rheumatic]], [[neurologic]], or [[asthmatic]] symptoms.<ref>Schantz PM.

''[[Toxocara canis]]'' and ''[[Toxocara cati]]'' are perhaps the most [[ubiquitous]] [[gastrointestinal]] worms ([[helminth]]s) of domestic dogs and cats and foxes. There are many 'accidental' or [[paratenic]] hosts including humans, birds, pigs, rodents, goats, monkeys, and rabbits.<ref name="afip.org"/> In paratenic hosts the larvae never mature and remain at the L2 stage.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta">Markell, Edward K. and Marietta Voge.

There are three main syndromes: ''[[visceral larva migrans]]'' (VLM), which encompasses diseases associated with major organs; ''covert toxocariasis'', which is a milder version of VLM; and ''ocular larva migrans'' (OLM), in which pathological effects on the host are restricted to the eye and the [[optic nerve]].<ref name=Despommier>{{cite journal |author= Despommier D. |title=Toxocariasis: clinical aspects, epidemiology, medical ecology, and molecular aspects |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=265–272 |year=2003 |pmid=12692098 |doi= 10.1128/CMR.16.2.265-272.2003 |pmc= 153144}}</ref>

==History of discovery==
Werner described a parasitic nematode in dogs in 1782 which he named ''Ascaris canis''. Johnston determined that what Werner had described was actually a member of the genus ''Toxocara'' established by Stiles in 1905. Fữlleborn speculated that ''T canis'' larvae might cause granulomatous nodules in humans. In 1947 Perlingiero and Gyorgy described the first case of what was probably toxocariasis.  Their patient was a 2-year old boy from Florida who had classical symptoms and esoinophilic necrotizing granulomas.<ref>Marty, Aileen. Toxocariasis Chapter 27, pages 411- 421 in Meyers WM, Neafie RC, Marty AM, Wear DJ. (Eds) Pathology of Infectious Diseases Volume I: Helminthiases. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington DC. 2000;http://www.afip.org/cgi-bin/description.cgi?item=FS28</ref> In 1950, Campbell-Wilder was the first to describe toxocariasis in humans; she published a paper describing ocular granulomas in patients with endophthalmitis, Coasts disease, or pseudoglioma. Two years later, Beaver et al. published the presence of ''Toxocara'' larvae in granulomas removed from patients with symptoms similar to those in Wilder’s patients.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V.

==Clinical presentation==
Physiological reactions to ''Toxocara'' infection depend on the host’s immune response and the parasitic load.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung">Huh, Sun and Sooung Lee. eMedicine from WebMD. “Toxocariasis.” 20 Aug. 2008. 26 Jan. 2009.<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/229855-overview></ref> Most cases of ''Toxocara'' infection are asymptomatic, especially in adults.<ref name="CDC3">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Parasitic diseases. "Fact Sheet: Toxocariasis." 5 Nov. 2007. 19 Jan. 2009. <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/toxocara/factsht_toxocara.htm></ref><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC2">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Covert toxocariasis is the least serious of the three syndromes and is believed to be due to chronic exposure.  Signs and symptoms of covert toxocariasis are coughing, fever, abdominal pain, headaches, and changes in behavior and ability to sleep.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> Upon medical examination, wheezing, [[hepatomegaly]], and [[lymphadenitis]] are often noted.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/>   

High parasitic loads or repeated infection can lead to visceral larva migrans (VLM).<ref name="CDC3"/> VLM is primarily diagnosed in young children, because they are more prone to exposure and ingestion of infective eggs.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/> ''Toxocara'' infection commonly resolves itself within weeks, but chronic [[eosinophilia]] may result.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/>  In VLM, larvae migration incites inflammation of internal organs and sometimes the central nervous system.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC3"/> Symptoms depend on the organ(s) affected.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> Patients can present with pallor, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, fever, headache, rash, cough, asthma, chest tightness, increased irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> Sometimes the subcutaneous migration tracks of the larvae can be seen.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/> Patients are commonly diagnosed with pneumonia, bronchospasms, chronic pulmonary inflammation, hypereosinophilia, hepatomegaly, [[hypergammaglobulinaemia]] (IgM, IgG, and IgE classes), [[leucocytosis]], and elevated anti-A and –B isohaemagglutinins.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Despommier"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="CDC3"/> Severe cases have occurred in people who are hypersensitive to allergens; in rare cases, epilepsy, inflammation of the heart, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, and death have resulted from VLM.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> 

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Ocular granuloma.jpg|thumb|left|Ocular granuloma from L2 larvae]] -->
Ocular larva migrans (OLM) is rare compared with VLM.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref>The Merck Veterinary Manual. “Roundworm.” 2008. 26 Jan. 2009 <http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/23505.htm></ref> A light ''Toxocara'' burden is thought to induce a low immune response, allowing a larva to enter the host’s eye.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> Although there have been cases of concurrent OLM and VLM, these are extremely exceptional.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> OLM often occurs in just one eye and from a single larva migrating into and encysting within the orbit.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="ocular larva migrans">Review of Optometry Online: Handbook of Ocular Disease Management.

A case study published in 2008 supported the hypothesis that eosinophilic cellulitis may also be caused by infection with ''Toxocara''.  In this study, the adult patient presented with eosinophilic cellulitis, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and a positive [[ELISA]] for ''T. cani''s.<ref>Bassukas, Ioannis D., Georgios Gaitanis, Aikaterini Zioga, Christina Boboyianni, and Christina Stergiopoulou. Febrile “migrating” eosinophilic cellulitis with hepatosplenomegaly: adult Toxocariasis – a case report. Cases Journal 2008, 1:356</ref>

==Transmission==
Transmission of ''Toxocara'' to humans is usually through ingestion of infective eggs.<ref name="CDC3"/><ref name="CDC1">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Parasitic diseases. "Guidelines for Veterinarians: Prevention of Zoonotic Transmission of Ascarids and Hookworms of Dogs and Cats." 27 Sept. 2004 19 Jan. 2009 <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/ascaris/prevention.htm></ref> ''T. canis'' can lay around 200,000 eggs per day. <ref name="Cheprasov"/>  These eggs are passed in cat or dog feces, but the defecation habits of dogs cause ''T. canis'' transmission to be more common than that of ''T. cati''. <ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="CDC1"/> Both ''Toxocara canis'' and ''Toxocara cati'' eggs require a several week incubation period in moist, humid, weather, outside of a host before becoming infective, so fresh eggs cannot cause toxocariasis.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC1"/> <ref name="Cheprasov"/>

Many objects and surfaces can become contaminated with infectious ''Toxocara'' eggs.  Flies that feed on feces can spread ''Toxocara'' eggs to surfaces or foods.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> Young children who put contaminated objects in their mouths or eat dirt ([[Pica (disorder)|pica]]) are at risk of developing symptoms.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Despommier"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> Humans can also contaminate foods by not washing their hands before eating.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC3"/> 

Humans are not the only accidental hosts of ''Toxocara''.  Eating undercooked rabbit, chicken, or sheep can lead to infection; encysted larvae in the meat can become reactivated and migrate through a human host, causing toxocariasis.  Special attention should be paid to thoroughly cooking giblets and liver to avoid transmission.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/>

==Reservoir==
Dogs and foxes are the reservoir for ''Toxocara canis'', but puppies and cubs pose the greatest risk of spreading the infection to humans.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC3"/> Infection in most adult dogs is characterized by encysted second stage larvae.  However, these larvae can become reactivated in pregnant females and cross the placental barrier to infect the pups.  Vertical transmission can also occur through breastmilk.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="CDC4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, DPDx: Parasites and Health.  “Toxocariasis.” 19 Jan. 2009 <http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Toxocariasis.htm></ref> Infectious mothers, and puppies under five weeks old, pass eggs in their feces.<ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="CDC4"/> Approximately 50% of  puppies and 20% of adult dogs are infected with ''T. canis''.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/> 

Cats are the reservoir for ''Toxocara cati''.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC3"/> As with ''T. canis'', encysted second stage larvae in pregnant or lactating cats become reactivated.  However, vertical transmission can only occur through breastfeeding.<ref name="CDC1"/>

==Vector==
Flies can act as mechanical vectors for Toxocara, but most infections occur without a vector.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/>

==Incubation period==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Embryonated egg.jpg|thumb|right|''Toxocara canis'' embryonated egg]] -->
The incubation period for ''Toxocara canis'' and ''cati'' eggs depends on temperature and humidity.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="CDC1"/> Under ideal summer conditions, eggs can mature to the infective stage after two weeks outside of a host.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC1"/> ''Toxocara'' eggs can remain infectious for years, as they are very resistant to the effects of chemicals, as well as changes in temperature.<ref name="Harris Linton"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="Soskolne">Soskolne, Gayle. The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology: Animal Diversity Web. “Toxocara cati.” 2001. 26 Jan. 2009 <http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Toxocara_cati.html></ref>

==Morphology==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Adulttoxocara.png|thumb|left]] -->
Both species produce eggs that are brown and pitted.<ref name="Harris Linton"/><ref>The Merck Veterinary Manual. “Roundworm.” 2008. 26 Jan. 2009 <http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/23505.htm></ref><ref name="Soskolne"/> ''T. canis'' eggs measure 75-90&nbsp;µm and are spherical in shape, whereas the eggs of ''T. cati'' are 65-70&nbsp;µm in diameter and oblong.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Harris Linton"/><ref name="Soskolne"/> Second stage larvae hatch from these eggs and are approximately 0.5mm long and 0.02mm wide.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> Adults of both species have complete digestive systems and three lips, each composed of a dentigerous ridge.<ref name="Harris Linton"/><ref name="Soskolne"/>

Adult ''T. canis'' are found only within dogs and foxes and the males are 4–6&nbsp;cm in length, with a curved posterior end.<ref name="Despommier"/><ref name="Harris Linton"/> The males each have spicules and one “tubular tesis.”<ref name="Harris Linton"/> Females can be as long as 15&nbsp;cm, with the vulva stretching one third of their bodylength.<ref name="Harris Linton"/> The females do not curve at the posterior end.<ref name="Despommier"/><ref name="Harris Linton"/> 

''T. cati'' adult females are approximately 10&nbsp;cm long, while males are typically 6&nbsp;cm or less.  The ''T. cati'' adults only occur within cats, and male ''T. cati'' are curved at the posterior end.<ref name="Soskolne"/>

==Life cycle==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Tlifecycle.png|thumb|left]] -->
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Toxocaralifecycle.jpg|thumb|right]] -->
Both cats, dogs and foxes can become infected with ''Toxocara'' through the ingestion of eggs or by transmission of the larvae from a mother to her offspring.<ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="CDC4"/> Transmission to cats and dogs can also occur by ingestion of infected accidental hosts, such as earthworms, cockroaches, rodents, rabbits, chickens, or sheep.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="Soskolne"/> 

Eggs hatch as second stage larvae in the intestines of the cat, dog or fox host (for consistency, this article will assume that second stage larvae emerge from ''Toxocara'' eggs, although there is debate as to whether larvae are truly in their second or third stage of development).<ref name="Despommier"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> Larvae enter the bloodstream and migrate to the lungs, where they are coughed up and swallowed.  The larvae mature into adults within the small intestine of a cat, dog or fox, where mating and egg laying occurs.<ref name="Harris Linton"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="ocular larva migrans"/><ref name="CDC1"/> Eggs are passed in the feces and only become infective after several weeks outside of a host.  During this incubation period, molting from first to second (and possibly third) stage larva takes place within the egg.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="Soskolne"/> In most adult dogs, cats and foxes, the full lifecycle does not occur, but instead second stage larvae encyst after a period of migration through the body.  Reactivation of the larvae is common only in pregnant or lactating cats, dogs and foxes.  The full lifecycle usually only occurs in these females and their offspring.<ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="CDC4"/>
 
Second stage larvae will also hatch in the small intestine of an accidental host, such as a human, after ingestion of infective eggs.  The larvae will then migrate through the organs and tissues of the accidental host, most commonly the lungs, liver, eyes, and brain.  Since L2 larvae cannot mature in accidental hosts, after this period of migration, ''Toxocara'' larvae will encyst as second stage larvae.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC1"/>

==Diagnostics==
Finding ''Toxocara'' larvae within a patient is the only definitive diagnosis for toxocariasis; however, biopsies to look for second stage larvae in humans are generally not very effective.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> PCR, ELISA, and serological testing are more commonly used to diagnose ''Toxocara'' infection.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> Serological tests are dependant on the number of larvae within the patient, and are unfortunately not very specific.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> ELISAs are much more reliable and currently have a 78% sensitivity and a 90% specificity.<ref name="Auweerter">Auweerter, Paul. Johns Hopkins. Point-of-Care Information Technology Center: ABX Guide. “Toxocariasis.”  8 Jan. 2008. 19 Feb. 2009 <http://prod.hopkins-abxguide.org/pathogens/parasites/toxocariasis.html?contentInstanceId=425999&siteId=153></ref> A 2007 study announced an ELISA specific to ''Toxocara canis'', which will minimize false positives from cross reactions with similar roundworms and will help distinguish if a patient is infected with ''T. canis'' or ''T. cati''.<ref>Iddawela, R.D., R.P.V.J.

==Treatment==
Toxocariasis will often resolve itself, because the ''Toxocara'' larvae cannot mature within human hosts.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/> Corticosteroids are prescribed in severe cases of VLM or if the patient is diagnosed with OLM.  Either  albendazole (preferred) or mebendazole (“second line therapy”) may be prescribed.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="ocular larva migrans"/><ref name="Auweerter"/> Granulomas can be surgically removed, or laser photocoagulation and cryoretinopexy can be used to destroy ocular granulomas.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V.

==Epidemiology==
Humans are accidental hosts of ''Toxocara'', yet toxocariasis is seen throughout the world.  Most cases of toxocariasis are seen in people under the age of twenty.<ref name="CDC2"/> Seroprevalence is higher in developing countries, but can be considerable in first world countries, as well.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> In Bali, St. Lucia, Nepal and other countries, seroprevalence is over fifty percent.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> Previous to 2007, the U.S. seroprevalence was thought to be around 5% in children.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/> However, Won et al. discovered that U.S. seroprevalence is actually 14% for the population at large.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/><ref name="CDC2"/> In many countries, toxocariasis is considered very rare.   Approximately 10,000 clinical cases are seen a year in the U.S., with ten percent being OLM.<ref name="CDC2"/><ref name="ocular larva migrans"/> Permanent vision loss occurs in 700 of these  cases.<ref name="ocular larva migrans"/> 

Young children are at the greatest risk of infection because they play outside and tend to place contaminated objects and dirt in their mouths.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Despommier"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> Dog ownership is another known risk factor for transmission.<ref name="Despommier"/> There is also a significant correlation between high ''Toxocara'' antibody titers and epilepsy in children.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/>

Parasitic loads as high as 300 larvae in a single gram of liver have been noted in humans.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> The “excretory-secretory antigens of larvae… released from their outer epicuticle coat [and]… readily sloughed off when bound by specific antibodies” incite the host’s immune response.<ref name="Huh, Sun, Sooung"/> The tipping point between development of VLM and OLM is believed to be between 100 and 200 larvae.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> The lighter infection in OLM is believed to stimulate a lower immune response and allow for migration of a larva into the eye.  Larvae are thought to enter the eye through the optic nerve, central retinal artery, short posterior ciliary arteries, soft tissues, or cerebrospinal fluid.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="ocular larva migrans"/> Ocular granulomas that form around a larva typically are peripheral in the retina or optic disc.<ref name="ocular larva migrans"/>

Visceral larva migrans seems to affect children aged 1-4 more often while ocular larva migrans more frequently affects children aged 7-8. Between 4.6% and 23% of U.S. children have been infected with the dog roundworm egg. This number is much higher in other parts of the world, such as Colombia, where up to 81% of children have been infected. <ref name="Cheprasov" />

==Public health and preventions==
Actively involving veterinarians and pet owners is important for controlling the transmission of ''Toxocara'' from pets to humans. A group very actively involved in promoting a reduction of infections in dogs in the United States is the [[Companion Animal Parasite Council|Companion Animal Parasite Council -- CAPC]].  Since pregnant or lactating dogs and cats and their offspring have the highest, active parasitic load, these animals should be placed on a deworming program.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="CDC3"/><ref name="CDC1"/> Pet feces should be picked up and disposed of or buried, as they may contain ''Toxocara'' eggs.<ref name="CDC3"/> Practicing this measure in public areas, such as parks and beaches, is especially essential for decreasing transmission. <ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Despommier"/> Up to 20% of soil samples of U.S. playgrounds have found roundworm eggs. <ref name="Cheprasov"> Cheprasov, Artem. 2012. Death at the Playground. Guru Magazine. 11. pp. 59-61.</ref> Also, sandboxes should be covered when not in use to prevent cats from using them as litter boxes.  Hand washing before eating and after playing with pets, as well as after handling dirt will reduce the chances of ingesting ''Toxocara'' eggs.<ref name="Markell, Edward, Marietta"/><ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/><ref name="CDC3"/> Washing all fruits and vegetables, keeping pets out of gardens and thoroughly cooking meats can also prevent transmission.<ref name="Holland, Celia and H.V. Smith"/> Finally, teaching children not to place nonfood items, especially dirt, in their mouths will drastically reduce the chances of infection.<ref name="CDC3"/> 
 
Toxocariasis has been named one of the neglected diseases of U.S. poverty, because of its prevalence in Appalachia, the southern U.S., inner city settings, and minority populations.<ref name="Hotez">{{cite journal | author = Hotez PJ | last2 = Brooker | first2 = Simon | editor1-last = Brooker | editor1-first = Simon | title = Neglected Infections of Poverty in the United States of America | journal = PLOS: Neglected Tropical Diseases | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = e256 | year = 2008 | month = June | pmid =  18575621 | pmc = 2430531| doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000256}}</ref> Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine available or under development.<ref name="CDC2"/><ref name="Hotez"/> However, the mitochondrial genomes of both ''T. cati'' and ''T. canis'' have recently been sequenced, which could lead to breakthroughs in treatment and prevention.<ref>Li, Ming-Wei, Rui-Qing Lin, Hui-Qun Song, Xiang-Yun Wu and Xing-Quan Zhu.
