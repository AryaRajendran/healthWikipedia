'''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive''' ('''ADHD-PI''') is one of the three subtypes of [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). The term was formally changed in 1994 in the new [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition]] (DSM-IV) to "ADHD predominantly inattentive" (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), though the term attention deficit disorder is still widely used. ADHD-PI is similar to the other subtypes of ADHD in that it is characterized primarily by inattention, easy distractibility, disorganization, procrastination, and forgetfulness; where it differs is in [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy - fatigue]], and having fewer or no symptoms of [[hyperactivity]] or impulsiveness typical of the other ADHD subtypes. Different countries have used different ways of diagnosing ADHD-PI. In the United Kingdom, diagnosis is based on quite a narrow set of symptoms, and about 0.5–1% of children are thought to have attention or hyperactivity problems. The United States used a much broader definition of the term ADHD. As a result, up to 10% of children in the U.S. were described as having ADHD. Current estimates suggest that ADHD is present throughout the world in about 1–5% of the population. About five times more boys than girls are diagnosed with ADHD. Medications include two classes of drugs, [[stimulants]] and non-stimulants. Drugs for ADHD are divided into first-line medications and second-line medications. First-line medications include several of the stimulants, and tend to have a higher response rate and effect size than second-line medications. Although medication can help improve concentration, it does not cure ADHD and the symptoms will come back once the medication stops.

==Differences from other ADHD subtypes==
ADHD-I is similar to the other subtypes of ADHD in that it is characterized primarily by inattention, easy distractibility, disorganization, procrastination, and forgetfulness; where it differs is in [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy - fatigue]], and having fewer or no symptoms of [[hyperactivity]] or impulsiveness typical of the other ADHD subtypes.<ref name="add_college">{{cite book | last = Quinn | first = Patricia | title = ADD and the College Student: A Guide for High School and College Students with Attention Deficit Disorder | publisher = Magination Press | year = 1994 | location = New York, NY | pages = 2–3 | url = http://www.maginationpress.com/4416630.html | isbn = 1-55798-663-0}}</ref> In some cases, children who enjoy learning may develop a sense of fear when faced with structured or planned work, especially long or group-based that requires extended focus, even if they thoroughly understand the topic.

The inattentive children may realize on some level that they are somehow different internally from their peers. However, they are also likely to accept and internalize the continuous negative feedback, creating a negative [[self-image]] that becomes [[self-reinforcing]].  If these children progress into adulthood undiagnosed or untreated, their inattentiveness, ongoing frustrations, and poor self-image frequently create numerous and severe problems maintaining healthy relationships, succeeding in [[postsecondary]] schooling, or succeeding in the workplace.  These problems can compound frustrations and low [[self-esteem]], and will often lead to the development of secondary pathologies including [[anxiety disorders]], [[sexual promiscuity]], [[mood disorders]], and [[substance abuse]].<ref name="adhd_in_adulthood"/>

It has been suggested<ref name="add_college">{{cite book | last = Quinn | first = Patricia | title = ADD and the College Student: A Guide for High School and College Students with Attention Deficit Disorder | publisher = Magination Press | year = 1994 | location = New York, NY | pages = 13 | url = http://www.maginationpress.com/4416630.html | isbn = 1-55798-663-0}}</ref>  that some of the symptoms of ADHD present in childhood appear to be less overt in adulthood.  This is likely due to an adult's ability to make [[cognitive]] adjustments and develop [[coping skill]]s minimizing the frequency of inattentive or hyperactive behaviors.  However, the core problems of ADHD do not disappear with age.<ref name="adhd_in_adulthood"/>  Some researchers have suggested that individuals with reduced or less overt hyperactivity symptoms should receive the ADHD-combined diagnosis.

In the [[Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#DSM-III_.281980.29|DSM-III]], sluggishness, drowsiness, and [[daydreaming]] were listed as characteristics of ADD without hyperactivity. The symptoms were removed from the ADHD criteria in DSM-IV because, although those with ADHD were found to have these symptoms, this only occurred with the absence of hyperactive symptoms. These distinct symptoms were described as [[sluggish cognitive tempo]] (SCT).

A meta-analysis of 37 studies on cognitive differences between those with ADHD-Inattentive type and ADHD-Combined type found that "the ADHD/C subtype performed better than the ADHD/I subtype in the areas of processing speed, attention, performance IQ, memory, and fluency. The ADHD/I subtype performed better than the ADHD/C group on measures of flexibility, working memory, visual/spatial ability, motor ability, and language. Both the ADHD/C and ADHD/I groups were found to perform more poorly than the control group on measures of inhibition, however, there was no difference found between the two groups. Furthermore the ADHD/C and ADHD/I subtypes did not differ on measures of sustained attention."<ref name="Lane, B. 2004">Lane, B. (2004).

==Symptoms==

===DSM-IV criteria===
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] allows for diagnosis of the ''predominantly inattentive'' subtype of ADHD (under code 314.00) if the individual presents six or more of the following symptoms of inattention for at least six months to a point that is disruptive and inappropriate for developmental level:

*Often does not give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities.
*Often has trouble keeping attention on tasks or play activities
*Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.
*Often does not follow instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions).
*Often has trouble organizing activities.
*Often avoids, dislikes, or doesn't want to do things that take a lot of mental effort for a long period (such as schoolwork or homework).
*Often loses things needed for tasks and activities (e.g. toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools).
*Is often easily distracted.
*Is often forgetful in daily activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behavenet.com/attention-deficithyperactivity-disorder |title=Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>

An ADD diagnosis is contingent upon the symptoms of impairment presenting themselves in two or more settings (e.g., at school or work and at home). There must also be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. Lastly, the symptoms must not occur exclusively during the course of a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], or other [[psychotic disorder]], and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., [[mood disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[dissociative disorder]], [[personality disorder]]).

==Prevalence in children==

It is difficult to say exactly how many children worldwide have ADHD because different countries have used different ways of diagnosing it, while some do not diagnose it at all. In the UK, diagnosis is based on quite a narrow set of symptoms, and about 0.5–1% of children are thought to have attention or hyperactivity problems. In comparison, until recently, professionals in the U.S. used a much broader definition of the term ADHD. As a result, up to 10% of children in the U.S. were described as having ADHD. Current estimates suggest that ADHD is present throughout the world in about 1–5% of the population. About five times more boys than girls are diagnosed with ADHD. Boys are seen as the prototypical ADHD child, therefore they are often overdiagnosed with ADHD than girls.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bruchmuller |first=Katrin |coauthors=Margraf, Schneider |title=Is ADHD diagnosed in accord with diagnostic criteria? Overdiagnosis and influence of client gender on diagnosis |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |year=2012 |volume=80 |pages=128–138 |doi=10.1037/a0026582 |url=http://my.apa.org |accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> This may be partly because of the particular ways they express their difficulties. Boys and girls both have attention problems, but boys are more likely to be overactive and difficult to manage. Children from all cultures and social groups are diagnosed with ADHD. However, children from certain backgrounds may be particularly likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, because of different expectations about how they should behave. It is therefore important to ensure that a child's cultural background is understood and taken into account as part of the assessment.<ref name="whatisadd">{{cite web |url=http://whatisadd.net |title=What is ADD |accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>

Second-line medications are usually anti-depressant medications such as [[Zoloft]], [[Prozac]], and [[Wellbutrin]]. These medications can help with fidgeting, inattentiveness, irritability, and trouble sleeping. Some of the symptoms the medications target are also found with ADD patients.<ref>[http://www.healing-arts.org/children/ADHD/medications.htm Pharmaceutical treatments for ADHD-Medications]. Retrieved 2011-04-09</ref>

Although ADHD has most often been treated with medication there are questions as to the efficacy of these medications. Medications do not cure ADHD; they are used solely to treat the symptoms associated with this disorder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/complete-index.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental health}}</ref> The symptoms will come back once the medication stops. Also, medication works better for some patients while it barely works for others.<ref name="Medications2">{{cite web|url=http://helpguide.org/mental/adhd_medications.htm |title=Are ADHD Drugs Right for You or Your Child?|accessdate=2010-04-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100411085751/http://helpguide.org/mental/adhd_medications.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Many studies have shown the use of psychostimulants to be an effective treatment for ADHD, as well as ADD, however these studies have shown a number of methodological flaws. Firstly they measure behaviour changes from the perspective of the parents, or teachers involved and assume that this change in behaviour is helping the child without ever consulting with the child.<ref name="Visser 2009 127–140">{{cite journal|last=Visser|first=john|coauthors=Jehan|title=ADHD: a scientific fact or a factual opinion? A critique of the veracity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|journal=Emotional and behavioural difficulties|date=June 2009|year=2009|volume=14|pages=127–140}}</ref> This has led to a questioning of who the medication is actually helping, and if the medication is being used simply to eliminate unwanted childhood behaviours rather than to actually help the child. Although most studies focus on children with ADHD the side effects and potential misuse of stimulant medications is identical for ADHD as many of the same medications are used (e.g. ritalin).

These studies have often failed to look at long-term efficacy and side effects. The psychostimulants used to treat ADHD normally start to lose efficacy after a very short period (often less than six weeks<ref name="Visser 2009 127–140"/>) and as this efficacy decreases the dosage given to the child must be increased, leading to a continuous cycle of more and more medication. These medications do work very quickly once administered and so may affect behaviour almost immediately, although this has again led to the idea that the medication may be getting used as a way to remove unwanted behaviours in a short-term situation.

Some have expressed concerns that educators may place undue pressure on students and their parents to use stimulant medication.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Rowenna|title=Are drugs the solution to the problem of ADHD among young people|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/may/11/ritalin-adhd-drugs}}</ref>

Along with medication, behavioral therapy is recommended to improve organizational skills, study techniques or social functioning.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Children with ADHD can be extremely disorganized. Parents should work with them to find specific places for everything and teach kids to use [[calendars]] and schedules. Parents are advised to get children into sports to help them build discipline, [[confidence]], and improve their social skills. Physical activity boosts the brain’s [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]] levels and all these neurotransmitters affect focus and attention. Some sports may be too challenging and would add frustration. Parents should talk with their children about what activities and exercises most stimulate and satisfy them before signing them up for classes or sports.<ref name="Additude">{{cite web|url=http://www.additudemag.com/adhd-web/article/571.html |title=The Best Summer Sports for ADHD Kids|accessdate=2010-04-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100420032346/http://www.additudemag.com/adhd-web/article/571.html| archivedate= 20 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
