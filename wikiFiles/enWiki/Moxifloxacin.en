'''Moxifloxacin''' is a fourth-generation synthetic [[fluoroquinolone]] [[antibacterial agent]] developed by Bayer AG (initially called BAY 12-8039). It is marketed worldwide (as the hydrochloride) under the brand names '''Avelox''', '''Avalox''', and '''Avelon''' for oral treatment. In most countries, the drug is also available in parenteral form for intravenous infusion. Moxifloxacin is also sold in an ophthalmic solution (eye drops) under the brand names '''Vigamox''', '''Moxeza''' for the treatment of conjunctivitis (pink eye).

A United States patent application was submitted on 30 June 1989, for Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride).<ref name=vision3001>{{cite web |author=Drugwatch |title=Avelox Patent Family |url=http://www.drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/tradename/index.php?query=AVELOX |accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> In 1999 Avelox was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in the United States.<ref name="Details for NDA:021085">{{cite web |title=Details for NDA:021085 |url=http://www.drugpatentwatch.com/premium/preview/NDA/index.php?021085 |publisher=DrugPatentWatch |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>

In the United States, moxifloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/021085s55-021277s052lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> In the European Union, it is licensed for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bacterial sinusitis. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2010/08/WC500095423.pdf |title=www.emea.europa.eu |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  In the US, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings against skin reactions. 

Avelox (moxifloxacin) was launched in the United States in 1999 and is currently{{when|date=June 2012}} marketed in more than 80 countries worldwide. In the United States, Avelox is marketed by Bayer's partner Merck. 

In 2011 the FDA added two boxed warnings for this drug in reference to spontaneous tendon ruptures and the fact that moxifloxacin may cause worsening of [[myasthenia gravis]] symptoms, including muscle weakness and life-threatening breathing problems.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/021085s047,021277s041lbl.pdf</ref>

Most recently,{{when|date=June 2012}} the German regulatory authorities placed additional restrictions on the use of oral moxifloxacin in patients with acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) stating that in case of these diseases moxifloxacin should only be prescribed when other antibiotics that have been initially recommended for treatment cannot be used or have failed. Additional notice was given that rhabdomyolysis, the exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and the risk of cardiac arrhythmia in women and older patients, was associated with moxifloxacin.<ref>{{Citation
 | url = http://www.akdae.de/Arzneimittelsicherheit/RHB/Archiv/2009/20090119.pdf
 | accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref>  QT prolongations induced by moxifloxacin were discussed extensively at the pre-approval FDA Advisory Committee meeting, but the meeting adjourned with a majority vote in favor of approval. The official US prescribing information notes that no increase in cardiovascular mortality or morbidity was seen among approximately 15,500 patients enrolled in pre-approval clinical trials, nor in 18,000 additional patients in a post-approval study. The Prescribing Information notes that caution should be exercised in using the drug in patients who are at high risk of arrhythmia to to pre-existing conditions or concomitant treatment with other drugs that prolong the QT interval.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov"/>

==Contraindications==

There are only two listed contraindications found within the 2008 package insert:

*"[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs): Although not observed with moxifloxacin in preclinical and clinical trials, the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone may increase the risks of [[Central nervous system|CNS]] stimulation and convulsions."<ref name="insert">{{cite web |author=Bayer |title=AVELOX (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) Tablets AVELOX I.V.

*"Moxifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components."<ref name="insert" />

Though not stated as such within the package insert, ziprasidone is also considered to be contraindicated, as it may have the potential to prolong QT interval. Moxifloxacin should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants).<ref name="umm.edu">{{cite web |title=Moxifloxacin |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/drugs/moxifloxacin-088848.htm |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center |year=2009 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>

Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients suffering from diabetes, as glucose regulation may be significantly altered.<ref name="umm.edu"/>

Moxifloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, [[pregnancy]], nursing mothers, patients with a history of tendon disorder, patients with documented QT prolongation,<ref>http://www.akdae.de/Arzneimittelsicherheit/RHB/Archiv/2009/20090119.pdf</ref> and patients with [[epilepsy]] or other seizure disorders. Coadministration of moxifloxacin with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval or induce bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, amiodarone) should be avoided. Careful consideration should be given in the use of moxifloxacin in patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with conduction abnormalities.<ref name="umm.edu"/>

*'''Pregnancy'''
The fluoroquinolones rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and are extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. For this reason, the fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother's milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child's suffering from this syndrome as well, even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shin HC, Kim JC, Chung MK |title=Fetal and maternal tissue distribution of the new fluoroquinolone DW-116 in pregnant rats |journal=Comp.

*'''Pediatric population'''
With limited exceptions, fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the FDA due to the risk injury to the musculoskeletal system. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure), and Levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure). However, the fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK. It does not appear that there have been any pediatric trials involving oral or IV moxifloxacin to date. 

Within one study it was stated that the pediatric patient has a 3.4% chance of experiencing a serious musculoskeletal adverse event compared to 1.8% for a control group treated with other antibiotics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Noel GJ, Bradley JS, Kauffman RE |title=Comparative safety profile of levofloxacin in 2523 children with a focus on four specific musculoskeletal disorders |journal=Pediatr.

==Interactions==
Antacids containing [[aluminium]] or [[magnesium]] [[ion]]s inhibit the absorption of moxifloxacin. Drugs that prolong the [[QT interval]] (e.g., [[pimozide]]) may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The INR ([[prothrombin time|International Normalised Ratio]]) may be increased or decreased in patients treated with [[warfarin]]. Moxifloxacin has been shown in a number of case reports to interact with warfarin.<ref name="pmid15632222">{{cite journal |author=Elbe DH, Chang SW |title=Moxifloxacin-warfarin interaction: a series of five case reports |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=361–4 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15632222 |doi=10.1345/aph.1E179 |url=http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/abstract/39/2/361}}</ref> The exact mechanism for the warfarin-quinolone drug interaction is unknown.<ref name="scoup.net">{{cite web |author=Karen E. Brown |title=Top Ten Dangerous Drug Interactions in Long-Term Care |url=http://www.scoup.net/m3project/topten/#10 |publisher=Medication Management Project |accessdate=1 August 2009}}

</ref> A precautionary measure would be to monitor the INR more closely and, if necessary, adjust the anticoagulant dose as necessary. Moxifloxacin does not appear to inhibit theophylline metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stass HH |date=29 June – 3 July 1997 |title=Bay 12-8039 (BA) does not interact with theophylline (TH) |journal=Presented at the 20th International Congress of Chemotherapy }}</ref> However, caution may be warranted when using theophylline with all of the fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Drug Interaction Facts notes that some fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin, interact with theophylline.<ref name="scoup.net"/>

===Significant interactions===
Moxifloxacin is not believed to be associated with clinically significant drug interactions due to inhibition or stimulation of hepatic metabolism. Thus, it should not, for the most part, require special clinical or laboratory monitoring to ensure its safety.<ref>[http://cme.medscape.com/viewarticle/409517_8 Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, there is an additive effect of moxifloxacin and drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. Therefore, moxifloxacin should be used with caution when given concurrently with such drugs. Moxifloxacin also has a potential for a serious drug interaction with NSAIDS. In addition, the package insert cautions that prothrombin time should be closely monitored if moxifloxacin is concomitantly administered with warfarin.<ref>http://69.20.19.211/cder/warn/dec99/wl121599.pdf</ref>

A potentially serious drug interaction is the combination of [[corticosteroids]] and moxifloxacin, as this combination increases tendon toxicity, which has potential to result in [[tendonitis]] and disability.<ref>{{cite web |author=Renata Albrecht |title=NDA 21-085/S-012 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2002/21-085s012ltr.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=16 May 2002 |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>

==Overdose==
"In the event of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained. ECG monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure. About 3% and 9% of the dose of moxifloxacin, as well as about 2% and 4.5% of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively."(sic) Quoting from the 29 December 2008 package insert for Avelox.<ref name="insert" />

==Mechanism of action==
Moxifloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.

"Moxifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is available as the monohydrochloride salt of 13 1-cyclopropyl-7-[(S,S)-2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl]-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3 14 quinoline carboxylic acid. It is a slightly yellow to yellow crystalline substance with a molecular 15 weight of 437.9. Its empirical formula is C21H24FN3O4 *HCl." Quoting from the 29 December 2008 package insert for Avelox.<ref name="insert" />

There are a number of endogenous compounds that have been reported to be affected by moxifloxacin as inhibitors, alteraters, and depletors. See the latest package insert for Ciprofloxacin for additional details.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Approximately 52% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. The cytochrome P450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism, and is not affected by moxifloxacin. The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for approximately 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. Approximately 14% of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (M2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are approximately 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of M1 are, in general, less than 10% those of moxifloxacin.<ref name="insert" />

In vitro studies with cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit 80 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.<ref name="insert" />

The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects have not been studied.<ref name="insert" />

The half-life of moxifloxacin is 11.5-15.6 hours (single-dose, oral).<ref name="drugbank.ca">{{cite web |title=Drug card for Moxifloxacin (DB00218) |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00218 |publisher=DrugBank |location=Canada |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> Approximately 45% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug (~20% in urine and ~25% in feces). A total of 96% ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. The mean (± SD) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2 L/hr and 2.6 ± 0.5 L/hr, respectively.<ref name="drugbank.ca"/> The CSF penetration of moxifloxacin is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis.<ref>{{cite journal|pages=1080–2|title=Pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma in patients with tuberculous meningitis|author=Alffenaar J.

==Patent==
A United States patent application was made on 30 June 1989, for Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride),(Bayer A.G. being the assignee), which was subsequently approved on 5 February 1991. This patent was scheduled to expire on 30 June 2009. However, this patent was extended for an additional two and one half years on 16 September 2004, and as such is not expected to expire until 2012.<ref>http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/term/certs/4990517.pdf</ref>
Moxifloxacin was subsequently (ten years later) approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in the United States in 1999. There have been at least four additional United States patents filed regarding moxifloxacin hydrochloride since the 1989 United States application,<ref name="Inventors/Applicants"/><ref>US 4990517 A (Feb 1991) Petersen ''et al.''

==Antibiotic misuse and bacterial resistance==
{{See also|Antibiotic misuse|Antibiotic resistance}}
[[antibiotic resistance|Resistance]] to moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous [[pathogen]]s, including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[enterococci]], and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' now exhibit resistance worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacobs MR |title=Antimicrobial Agents And Resistance--Fifth International Symposium |journal=IDrugs |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=542–6 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15973559 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Widespread veterinary usage of the fluoroquinolones, in particular in Europe, has been implicated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Update On Extra-Label Use Of Fluoroquinolones |url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm127657.htm |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=16 July 1999 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>

Though considered to be a very important and necessary drug required to treat severe and life-threatening bacterial infections, the associated scripting abuse of moxifloxacin remains unchecked, which has contributed to the problem of bacterial resistance. The [[overuse of antibiotics]], such as happens with children suffering from [[otitis media]], has given rise to a breed of super-bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics entirely.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Froom J, Culpepper L, Jacobs M |title=Antimicrobials for acute otitis media?

For example, the use of the fluoroquinolones had increased three-fold in an emergency room environment in the United States between 1995 and 2002, while the use of safer alternatives such as [[macrolides]] declined significantly.<ref name="pmid15757551">{{cite journal |author=MacDougall C, Guglielmo BJ, Maselli J, Gonzales R |title=Antimicrobial drug prescribing for pneumonia in ambulatory care |journal=Emerging Infect.

Fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of [[antibiotics]] to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the FDA, such as [[acute bronchitis]], [[otitis media]], and acute [[upper respiratory tract infection]], according to a study that was supported in part by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.<ref name="pmid15745724"/><ref>K08 HS14563 and HS11313</ref> In addition, they are commonly prescribed for medical conditions that are not even bacterial to begin with, such as viral infections, or those to which no proven benefit exist.
