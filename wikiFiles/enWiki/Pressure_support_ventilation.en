'''Pressure support''' is a spontaneous [[modes of mechanical ventilation|mode of ventilation]] also named ''Pressure Support Ventilation'' (PSV). The patient initiates every breath and the ventilator delivers support with the preset pressure value. With support from the ventilator, the patient also regulates their own [[respiratory rate]] and their [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]].<ref name="pmid21235833">{{cite journal| author=Bonett S, Banner MJ, Euliano NR, Peters CW, Layon AJ, Gabrielli A| title=Pressure support ventilation advisory system provides valid recommendations for setting ventilator. | journal=Respir Care | year= 2011 | volume= 56 | issue= 3 | pages= 271–7 | pmid=21235833 | doi=10.4187/respcare.00656 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=21235833 }}</ref> 

In Pressure Support, the set inspiratory pressure [[Support (technical analysis)|support level]] is kept constant and there is a decelerating flow. The patient triggers all breaths. If there is a change in the mechanical properties of the lung/thorax and patient effort, the delivered tidal volume will be affected. The user must then regulate the pressure support level to obtain desired ventilation.<ref>MAQUET, "Modes of ventilation in SERVO-i, invasive and non-invasive", 2008 MAQUET [[Intensive care medicine|Critical Care]] AB, Order No 66 14 692</ref><ref>MAQUET, "Modes of ventilation in SERVO-s, invasive and non-invasive", 2009 MAQUET Critical Care AB, Order No 66 61 131</ref>
