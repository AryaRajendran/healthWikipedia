[[File:Hemodialysismachine.jpg|thumb|A [[hemodialysis]] machine, used to physiologically aid or replace the kidneys in renal failure]]

'''Renal failure''' (also '''kidney failure''' or '''renal insufficiency''') is a medical condition in which the [[kidney]]s fail to adequately filter waste products from the blood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/kidneyfailure.html |title=Kidney Failure |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> The two main forms are [[acute kidney injury]], which is often reversible with adequate treatment, and [[chronic kidney disease]], which is often not reversible. In both cases, there is usually an underlying cause.

Renal failure is mainly determined by a decrease in [[Renal function|glomerular filtration rate]], the rate at which blood is filtered in the [[Glomerulus|glomeruli]] of the kidney. This is detected by a [[oliguria|decrease]] in or [[anuria|absence of urine production]] or determination of waste products ([[creatinine]] or [[urea]]) in the blood. Depending on the cause, [[hematuria]] (blood loss in the urine) and [[proteinuria]] (protein loss in the urine) may be noted.

In renal failure, there may be problems with increased fluid in the body (leading to swelling), [[acidosis|increased acid levels]], [[hyperkalemia|raised levels of potassium]], [[hypocalcemia|decreased levels of calcium]], [[hyperphosphatemia|increased levels of phosphate]], and in later stages [[anemia]]. Bone health may also be affected. Long-term kidney problems are associated with an increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/691369 |title=Insulin Resistance in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease |year=2012 |last1=Liao |first1=Min-Tser |last2=Sung |first2=Chih-Chien |last3=Hung |first3=Kuo-Chin |last4=Wu |first4=Chia-Chao |last5=Lo |first5=Lan |last6=Lu |first6=Kuo-Cheng |journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology |volume=2012 |pages=1–5 |pmid=21836813 |last7=Rahman |first7=K |pmc=3151496}}</ref>

==Classification==
Can be divided into two categories: [[acute kidney injury]] or [[chronic kidney disease]]. The type of renal failure is determined by the trend in the serum [[Creatinine#Diagnostic use|creatinine]]. Other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney injury from chronic kidney disease include [[anemia]] and the kidney size on [[medical ultrasound|ultrasound]]. Chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size.

===Acute kidney injury===
{{main|Acute kidney injury}} 

[[Acute kidney injury]] (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF),<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=23194202 |year=2012 |last1=Moore |first1=EM |last2=Bellomo |first2=R |last3=Nichol |first3=AD |title=The meaning of acute kidney injury and its relevance to intensive care and anaesthesia |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=929–48 |journal=Anaesthesia and intensive care}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4414/smw.2012.13662 |title=New insights in acute kidney failure in the critically ill |year=2012 |last1=Ricci |first1=Zaccaria |last2=Ronco |first2=Claudio |journal=Swiss Medical Weekly |pmid=22923149 |volume=142 |pages=w13662}}</ref> is a rapidly progressive loss of [[renal function]],<ref name="Adam">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001530/ |title=Acute kidney failure |author=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> generally characterized by [[oliguria]] (decreased [[urine]] production, quantified as less than 400 [[millilitres|mL]] per day in adults,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199803053381007 |title=Acute Oliguria |year=1998 |last1=Klahr |first1=Saulo |last2=Miller |first2=Steven B. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=338 |issue=10 |pages=671–5 |pmid=9486997}}</ref> less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children or less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants); and [[Water-electrolyte imbalance|fluid and electrolyte imbalance]]. AKI can result from a variety of causes, generally classified as ''prerenal'', ''intrinsic'', and ''postrenal''. The underlying cause must be identified and treated to arrest the progress, and [[dialysis]] may be necessary to bridge the time gap required for treating these fundamental causes.

===Chronic kidney disease===
{{main|Chronic kidney disease}}

[[Chronic kidney disease]] (CKD) can also develop slowly and, initially, show few symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000471.htm |title=Chronic kidney disease |author=Medline Plus |year=2011 |work=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> CKD can be the long term consequence of irreversible acute disease or part of a disease progression.

===Acute-on-chronic renal failure===
Acute kidney injuries can be present on top of chronic kidney disease, a condition called acute-on-chronic renal failure (AoCRF). The acute part of AoCRF may be reversible, and the goal of treatment, as with AKI, is to return the patient to baseline renal function, typically measured by serum [[creatinine]]. Like AKI, AoCRF can be difficult to distinguish from chronic kidney disease if the patient has not been monitored by a [[physician]] and no baseline (i.e., past) blood work is available for comparison.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms can vary from person to person. Someone in early stage kidney disease may not feel sick or notice symptoms as they occur. When kidneys fail to filter properly, waste accumulates in the blood and the body, a condition called [[azotemia]]. Very low levels of azotaemia may produce few, if any, symptoms. If the disease progresses, symptoms become noticeable (if the failure is of sufficient degree to cause symptoms). Renal failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed [[uraemia]].<ref name="grinsted">{{cite web  | last = Dr Per Grinsted  | title = Kidney failure (renal failure with uremia, or azotaemia)  | date = 2005-03-02  | url = http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/kidneyfailure.htm  | accessdate = 2009-05-26}}</ref>

*High levels of urea in the blood, which can result in:
** [[Vomiting]] and/or [[diarrhea]], which may lead to [[dehydration]]
** [[Nausea]]
** Weight loss
** Nocturnal urination
** More frequent urination, or in greater amounts than usual, with pale urine
** Less frequent urination, or in smaller amounts than usual, with dark coloured urine
** Blood in the urine
** Pressure, or difficulty urinating
** Unusual amounts of urination, usually in large quantities
*A build up of [[phosphates]] in the blood that diseased kidneys cannot filter out may cause:
** Itching
** Bone damage
** Nonunion in broken bones
** [[Muscle cramps]] (caused by low levels of calcium which can be associated with [[hyperphosphatemia]])
*A build up of [[potassium]] in the blood that diseased kidneys cannot filter out (called [[hyperkalemia]]) may cause:
** Abnormal heart rhythms
** Muscle paralysis<ref>{{cite web  | last = MedicineNet, Inc. | title = Hyperkalemia  | date = 2008-07-03  | url = http://www.medicinenet.com/hyperkalemia/page4.htm  | accessdate = 2009-05-26}}</ref>
*Failure of kidneys to remove excess fluid may cause:
** Swelling of the legs, ankles, feet, face and/or hands
** Shortness of breath due to extra fluid on the lungs (may also be caused by anemia)
*Polycystic kidney disease, which causes large, fluid-filled cysts on the kidneys and sometimes the liver, can cause:
** Pain in the back or side
*Healthy kidneys produce the hormone [[erythropoietin]] that stimulates the [[bone marrow]] to make oxygen-carrying red blood cells. As the kidneys fail, they produce less erythropoietin, resulting in decreased production of red blood cells to replace the natural breakdown of old red blood cells. As a result, the blood carries less hemoglobin, a condition known as anemia. This can result in:
** Feeling tired and/or weak
** Memory problems
** Difficulty concentrating
** [[Dizziness]]
** Low blood pressure
*Normally, proteins are too large to pass through the kidneys, however, they are able to pass through when the glomeruli are damaged. This does not cause symptoms until extensive kidney damage has occurred,<ref name="proteinuria">{{cite web  | last = Lee A. Hebert, M.D., Jeanne Charleston, R.N. and Edgar Miller, M.D. | title = Proteinuria | year = 2009  | url = http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/proteinuria/  | accessdate = 2011-03-24}}</ref> after which symptoms include:

==Causes==

===Acute renal failure===
Acute kidney failure usually occurs when the blood supply to the kidneys is suddenly interrupted or when the kidneys become overloaded with toxins. Causes of acute failure include accidents, injuries, or complications from surgeries in which the kidneys are deprived of normal blood flow for extended periods of time. Heart-bypass surgery is an example of one such procedure.

Drug overdoses, accidental or from chemical overloads of drugs such as antibiotics or chemotherapy, may also cause the onset of acute kidney failure. Unlike chronic kidney disease, however, the kidneys can often recover from acute failure, allowing the patient to resume a normal life. People suffering from acute failure require supportive treatment until their kidneys recover function, and they often remain at increased risk of developing future kidney failure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/Kudiseases/pubs/yourkidneys/#7 |title=The Kidneys and How They Work
 |author=National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>

Among the accidental causes of renal failure is the [[crush syndrome]], when large amounts of [[toxin]]s are suddenly released in the [[blood circulation]] after a long compressed [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] is suddenly relieved from the pressure obstructing the blood flow through its tissues, causing [[ischemia]]. The resulting overload can lead to the [[clogging]] and the destruction of the kidneys. It is a [[reperfusion injury]] that appears after the release of the crushing pressure. The mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products – notably [[myoglobin]], [[potassium]], and [[phosphorus]] – that are the products of [[rhabdomyolysis]] (the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by [[ischemia|ischemic]] conditions). The specific action on the [[kidney]]s is not fully understood, but may be due in part to [[nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] [[metabolite]]s of myoglobin.

===Chronic kidney disease===
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has numerous causes. The most common causes of CKD are [[diabetes mellitus]] and long-term, uncontrolled [[hypertension]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=23120821 |year=2011 |last1=Kes |first1=Petar |last2=Basić-Jukić |first2=Nikolina |last3=Ljutić |first3=Dragan |last4=Brunetta-Gavranić |first4=Bruna |title=Uloga arterijske hipertenzije u nastanku kroničnog zatajenja bubrega |trans_title=The role of arterial hypertension in the development of chronic renal failure |language=Croatian |volume=65 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=78–84 |journal=Acta Medica Croatica |url=http://www.amzh.hr/amc/pdf/amc_2011%20vol%2065%20supplement%203.pdf}}</ref> [[Polycystic kidney disease]] is another well-known cause of CKD. The majority of people afflicted with polycystic kidney disease have a family history of the disease. Other genetic illnesses affect kidney function, as well.

Overuse of common drugs such as [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], and [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) can also cause chronic kidney damage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199412223312502 |title=Risk of Kidney Failure Associated with the Use of Acetaminophen, Aspirin, and Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs |year=1994 |last1=Perneger |first1=Thomas V. |last2=Whelton |first2=Paul K. |last3=Klag |first3=Michael J. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=331 |issue=25 |pages=1675–9 |pmid=7969358}}</ref>

Some infectious diseases, such as [[hantavirus]], can attack the kidneys, causing kidney failure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome |title=Renal involvement with hantavirus infection (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) |first1=Gerald B |last1=Appel |first2=Jukka |last2=Mustonen |year=2012 |work= |publisher=[[UpToDate]] |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>

==Diagnostic approach==

===Measurement for CKD===
;Stages of kidney failure

Chronic kidney failure is measured in five stages, which are calculated using a patient’s GFR, or [[glomerular filtration rate]]. Stage 1 CKD is mildly diminished renal function, with few overt symptoms. Stages 2 and 3 need increasing levels of supportive care from their medical providers to slow and treat their renal dysfunction. Patients in stages 4 and 5 usually require preparation of the patient towards active treatment in order to survive. [[Chronic kidney disease|Stage 5 CKD]] is considered a severe illness and requires some form of renal replacement therapy ([[dialysis]]) or [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] whenever feasible.

;Glomerular filtration rate

A normal GFR varies according to many factors, including sex, age, body size and race. Renal professionals consider the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to be the best overall index of kidney function.<ref>Fadem, Stephen Z., M.D., [http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/gfr_calculator.cfm FACP, FASN. Calculators for HealthCare Professionals. National Kidney Foundation. 13 Oct 2008]</ref> [[The National Kidney Foundation]] offers an easy to use on-line GFR calculator<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/gfr_calculator.cfm |title=GFR calculator |publisher=Kidney.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25}}</ref> for anyone who is interested in knowing their glomerular filtration rate. (A serum [[creatinine]] level, a simple blood test, is needed to use the calculator).

===Use of the term ''uremia''===
Before the advancement of modern medicine, renal failure was often referred to as uremic poisoning. Uremia was the term for the contamination of the blood with urine. Starting around 1847, this included reduced urine output, which was thought to be caused by the urine mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The term ''[[uremia]]'' is now used for the illness accompanying kidney failure.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra071313 |title=Uremia |year=2007 |last1=Meyer |first1=Timothy W. |last2=Hostetter |first2=Thomas H. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1316–25 |pmid=17898101}}</ref>
