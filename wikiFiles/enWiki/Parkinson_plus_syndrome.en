The atypical parkinsonian or Parkinson Plus syndromes are often difficult to differentiate from Parkinson's disease and each other. They include [[multiple system atrophy]] (MSA), [[progressive supranuclear palsy]] (PSP), and [[corticobasal degeneration]] (CBD). [[Dementia with Lewy bodies]] (DLB), may or may not be part of the PD spectrum, but it is increasingly recognized as the second most common type of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease. These disorders are currently lumped into two groups, the [[lewy neurites|synucleinopathies]] and the [[tauopathies]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mark, M. H. |title=Lumping and splitting the Parkinson Plus syndromes: dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and cortical-basal ganglionic degeneration.|journal=Neurologic Clinics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=607–27 |year=2001 |pmid=11532646}}</ref>

Additional Parkinson-plus syndromes include [[Pick's disease]] and '''[[olivopontocerebellar atrophy]]''' (OPCA).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Constance Ward|url=[http://www.aann.org/ce/pdf/0608b.pdf Characteristics and Symptom Management of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: A Multidisciplinary Approach]|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Nursing|volume=38|issue=4|pages=242–247|year=2006|PMID=16925000|title=Characteristics and symptom management of progressive supranuclear palsy: a multidisciplinary approach}}</ref> The latter is characterized by [[ataxia]] and [[dysarthria]], and may occur either as an inherited disorder or as a variant of multiple system atrophy. MSA is also characterized by [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] failure, formerly known as [[Shy-Drager syndrome]].<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/msa_orthostatic_hypotension/msa_orthostatic_hypotension.htm Multiple System Atrophy with Orthostatic Hypotension Information Page]</ref>

Clinical features that distinguish Parkinson-plus syndromes from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease include symmetrical onset, a lack of or irregular [[resting tremor]],  and a reduced response to [[Dopaminergic agonists|dopaminergic drugs]] (including [[levodopa]]).<ref name=Mitra /> Additional features include [[bradykinesia]], early-onset postural instability, increased [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]] in axial muscles, [[dysautonomia]], [[alien limb syndrome]], [[supranuclear palsy|supranuclear gaze palsy]], [[apraxia]], involvement of the cerebellum including the [[pyramidal cells]], and in some instances significant cognitive impairment.<ref name=Mitra />

Accurate diagnosis of these Parkinson-plus syndromes is improved when precise diagnostic criteria are used.<ref name=Mitra /> Since diagnosis of individual Parkinson-plus syndromes is difficult, the prognosis is often poor. Proper diagnosis of these neurodegenerative disorders is important as individual treatments will vary depending on the condition. [[Nuclear medicine]] [[SPECT]] procedure using [[iodine-123|123I]]-[[IBZM]], is an effective tool in the establishment of the differential diagnosis between patients with Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-Plus syndromes.<ref>[http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/39/6/954 Loss of Dopamine-D2 Receptor Binding Sites in Parkinsonian Plus Syndromes]</ref>

==Treatments==
The Parkinson-plus syndromes are usually more rapidly progressive and less likely to respond to anti-parkinsonian medication than Parkinson's disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|authors=Litvan I, Campbell G, Mangone CA, Verny M, McKee A, Chaudhuri KR, Jellinger K, Pearce RK, D'Olhaberriague L.|title=Which clinical features differentiate progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olzewski syndrome) from related disorders|journal=Brain|year=1997|month=Jan|volume=120|pages=65–74|pmid=9055798|issue=1|author=Litvan I, Campbell G, Mangone CA, ''et al.''}}</ref> However, the additional features of the [[disease]]s may respond to [[medication]]s not used in Parkinson's disease.

Current therapy for Parkinson-plus syndromes is centered around a multidisciplinary treatment of symptoms.<ref>Molloy, F. M., & Healy, D. G. (2011). Parkinsonism Plus Syndromes. In O. Hardiman & C.
