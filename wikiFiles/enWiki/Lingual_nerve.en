The '''lingual nerve''' is a branch of the [[mandibular nerve|mandibular division]] of the [[trigeminal nerve]] (CN V<sub>3</sub>), which supplies sensory innervation to the [[tongue]].  It also carries fibers from the  [[facial nerve]], which return taste information from the anterior two thirds of the tongue. 

==Function==
The lingual nerve supplies [[general somatic afferent]] innervation from the [[mucous membrane]] of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. 

It also carries nerve fibers that are not part of the trigeminal nerve, including the [[chorda tympani nerve]] of the facial nerve, which provides special sensation (taste) to the anterior 2/3 part of the tongue as well as [[parasympathetic]] and sympathetic fibers. 

The [[submandibular ganglion]] is suspended by two nerve filaments from the lingual nerve.

==Path==
The lingual nerve lies at first beneath the [[lateral pterygoid muscle]], medial to and in front of the [[inferior alveolar nerve]], and is occasionally joined to this nerve by a branch which may cross the [[internal maxillary artery]]. 

The [[chorda tympani]] (a branch of the facial nerve, CN VII) joins it at an acute angle here, carrying taste fibers from the anterior two thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to the [[submandibular ganglion]].

The nerve then passes between the [[medial pterygoid muscle]] and the ramus of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], and crosses obliquely to the side of the tongue over the [[constrictor pharyngis superior]] and [[styloglossus]], and then between the [[hyoglossus]] and deep part of the [[submandibular gland]]; it finally runs from laterally to medially inferiorly crossing the duct of the submandibular gland, and along the tongue to its tip becoming the sublingual nerve, lying immediately beneath the [[mucous membrane]].

==Lingual nerve injuries==
Dental procedures and in particular the administration of local anaesthetic can cause damage to the lingual nerve leading to lingual nerve neuropathy.
