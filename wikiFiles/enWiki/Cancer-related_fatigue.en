'''Cancer-related fatigue''' is a subjective [[symptom]] of [[fatigue (medicine)|fatigue]] that is experienced by nearly all [[cancer]] patients.  

Among patients receiving cancer treatment other than surgery, it is essentially universal.  Fatigue is a normal and expected side effect of most forms of [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[biotherapy]].<ref name=nccn />  On average, cancer-related fatigue is "more severe, more distressing, and less likely to be relieved by rest" than fatigue experienced by healthy people.<ref name=nccn />  It can range from mild to severe, and may be either temporary or a long-term effect.  

Fatigue may be a symptom of the cancer, or it may be the result of treatments for the cancer.

==Definition==
The [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] defines cancer-related fatigue as "a distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning".<ref name=nccn>{{cite web|url=http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/fatigue.pdf |title=NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology:  Cancer-Related Fatigue |publisher=[[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]]|edition=Version 1.2010 |date=22 January 2010}}

Cancer-related fatigue manifests as a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] fatigue (persistent fatigue not relieved by rest). The exact process of fatigue remains unknown - it may  relate to [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]]; however [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]] is not directly associated with cancer.<ref name=nci>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/fatigue/patient/allpages |title=Fatigue |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The [[pathophysiology]] of cancer-related fatigue is poorly understood.  It may be caused by the cancer or the effects it has on the body, by the body's response to the cancer, or by the [[cancer treatment]]s.  

Fatigue is a common [[symptom]] of cancer.<ref name=nci />

Some fatigue is caused by cancer treatments.  This may show a characteristic pattern.  For example, people on many [[chemotherapy regimen]]s often feel more fatigue in the week after treatments, and less fatigue as they recover from that round of medications.  People receiving [[radiation therapy]], by contrast, often find their fatigue steadily increases until the end of treatment.<ref name=nci />

Proposed mechanisms by which cancer can cause fatigue include an increase in [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]]s, dysregulation of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]], disruption of [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[muscle loss]] and [[cancer wasting]], and genetic problems.<ref name=nccn />  Additionally, some forms of cancer may cause fatigue through more direct mechanisms, such as a [[leukemia]] that causes [[anemia]] by preventing the [[bone marrow]] from producing blood cells efficiently.

==Screening==
The [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] recommends that every cancer patient be systematically screened for fatigue at the first visit with an [[oncologist]], throughout treatment, and afterwards.<ref name=nccn />  [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] typically involves a simple question, like "On a [[scale of one to ten]], how tired have you felt during the last week?" 

More detailed information may be collected in a [[symptom journal]].

==Evaluation==
Some causes of cancer-related fatigue are treatable, and evaluation is directed towards identifying these treatable causes.  Treatable causes of cancer-related fatigue include: [[anemia]], [[pain]], [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]], [[sleep disturbance]]s, nutritional disturbances, decreased [[physical fitness]] and activity, side effects from medications (e.g., [[sedative]]s), [[abuse of alcohol]] or other substances.<ref name=nccn />  Additionally, [[Comorbidity|other medical conditions]], such as [[infection]]s, [[heart disease]], or [[endocrine dysfunction]] (e.g., [[hot flashes]]), can cause fatigue, and may also need treatment.

==Management==
Treatment depends on the patient's overall situation.  A patient who is in active treatment may have different priorities than a person who has completed treatment, or who is at the end of life.

Some management strategies may help all patients and could be supported by the work of an [[Occupational Therapist]].  These include scheduling high-priority tasks during the patient's best time of day, using labor-saving devices, delegating tasks to caregivers, and avoiding unimportant activities, so that the patient will have more energy available for other activities.

Patients who are not at the end of life may benefit from physical exercise or [[physical therapy]].  Engaging in moderate activity reduces fatigue.<ref name=nccn />

While [[antidepressant]]s are ineffective at reducing fatigue in non-depressed cancer patients, the stimulant [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin) may reduce fatigue in some patients.<ref name=nccn />

At the end of life, fatigue is usually associated with other symptoms, especially anemia, side effects from many medications and previous treatments, and poor nutritional status.<ref name=nccn />  Pain, [[dyspnea|difficulty breathing]], and fatigue form a common symptom cluster.  Fatigue often increases as patients with advanced cancer approach death.  As a result, people who are dying often sleep much more than a healthy person.

===Addressing specific causes===
If the fatigue is caused or exacerbated by a specific medical condition, such as anemia, then treatment of that medical condition should reduce the fatigue.

* [[Anemia]]:  Loss of oxygen-carrying red blood cells is a common cause of fatigue.  Medications to improve blood production or [[blood transfusion]]s frequently reduce fatigue.
* [[Pain]]:  A variety of approaches to managing [[cancer pain]] may be used, particularly [[analgesic]] medications.
* [[Stress (medicine)|Emotional distress]]:  Anxiety and depression are strongly associated with fatigue in cancer patients.  [[Psychosocial]] treatments directed at reducing stress and increasing [[coping skill]]s may reduce fatigue.  Additionally, some patients in active treatment worry that the fatigue indicates treatment failure, and this anxiety may increase their fatigue in a [[vicious cycle]].  Education about fatigue as a normal side effect can reassure the patient.<ref name=nccn />  Up to 25% of cancer patients will experience depression.<ref name=nci />
* [[Sleep disturbance]]s:  Patients who do not sleep well are more tired than others.  Cancer patients commonly experience [[insomnia]] or [[hypersomnia]].  Sleep disturbances may be caused by sleeping too much during the day, by [[restless leg syndrome]], by pain, by anxiety, or by other medical conditions, like [[obstructive sleep apnea]] or [[menopause]].  Practicing good [[sleep hygiene]] may reduce fatigue by improving sleep quality.
* Nutritional disturbances:  Patients may have difficulty eating, may not be absorbing food well, or may have chosen an extreme diet as an [[alternative cancer treatment]].  [[Loss of appetite]], [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] may result in the patient consuming too few calories or becoming dehydrated.<ref name=nci />
* [[Physical fitness]] decreases with inactivity and so fatigue increases.
* Side effects from medications:  Fatigue and sleepiness are known side effects with some kinds of medications.  Sometimes a change of medication, the dose, or the timing of the medication may result in less fatigue.  For example, an [[antihistamine]] might be taken shortly before sleep, rather than in the middle of the day.
* [[Substance abuse]]:  [[Alcohol]], [[marijuana]], and [[depressant|many other drugs]] can produce fatigue as a side effect. 
* Other medical conditions:  Cancer and its treatment usually put intense physical stress on the body, which can exacerbate other medical conditions.  Additionally, fatigue may result from an infection.<ref name=nci />

==Prognosis==
Fatigue caused by the cancer or its treatment often resolves if treatment is successful.  However, some patients experience long-term fatigue.  When strict definitions are used, about 20% of long-term, disease-free [[cancer survivor]]s report fatigue.<ref name=nccn />  Under looser definitions, up to half of cancer survivors report fatigue.<ref name=nccn />  However, these studies are largely limited to white patients with [[breast cancer]], or peripheral [[stem cell transplant]] or [[bone marrow transplant]] patients, and the incidence may be different for survivors of other cancers.

Experiencing fatigue before treatment, being depressed or anxious, getting too little exercise, and having other medical conditions are all associated with higher levels of fatigue in post-treatment cancer survivors.<ref name=nccn />  Receiving multiple types of treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, is associated with more fatigue.<ref name=nci />  Older adults have a higher risk of long-term fatigue.<ref name=nci />
