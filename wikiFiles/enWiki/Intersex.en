'''Intersex''', in [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s, is a variation in [[sex]] characteristics including [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, and/or [[genital]]s that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female. Such variation may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal [[genotype]] and sexual [[phenotype]] other than XY-male and XX-female.<ref name="Money">{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |coauthors=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man & Woman Boy & Girl.

Research in the late 20th century has led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal—if relatively rare—forms of human biology. [[Milton Diamond]], one of the most outspoken experts on matters affecting intersex people, stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to such people.

==Conditions and scope==

There are a variety of opinions on what conditions are and are not intersex. For instance, the defunct [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) definition states that the following conditions "sometimes involve intersex anatomy" (note this does not mean they are always intersex conditions):<ref name="titleIntersex conditions|Intersex Society of North America">{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/conditions|title=Intersex conditions|work=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>

===Prevalence===
The prevalence of intersex depends on which definition is used. According to the ISNA definition above, 1 percent of live births exhibit some degree of sexual ambiguity.<ref name="ISNA frequency">{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency |title=How common is intersex? &#124; Intersex Society of North America |publisher=Isna.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births are ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including [[surgery]] to assign them to a given sex category (i.e. male or female). According to Fausto-Sterling's definition of intersex,<ref name="sexing"/> on the other hand, 1.7 percent of human births are intersex.<ref name="sexing"/> She writes,
{{cquote|While male and female stand on the extreme ends of a biological continuum, there are many bodies [...] that evidently mix together anatomical components conventionally attributed to both males and females. The implications of my argument for a sexual continuum are profound. If nature really offers us more than two sexes, then it follows that our current notions of masculinity and femininity are cultural conceits.
[...] Modern surgical techniques help maintain the two-sex system. Today children who are born "either/or-neither/both" — a fairly common phenomenon — usually disappear from view because doctors "correct" them right away with surgery.<ref name="sexing">{{cite book

====Ambiguous genitalia====
[[File:Ambiguous genitalia.jpg|thumb|170px|Ambiguous genitalia in infant [[autopsy]]]]
Ambiguous genitalia appear as a large clitoris or small penis.

Because there is variation in all of the processes of the [[Sex organ#Development|development of the sex organs]], a child can be born with a [[sexual anatomy]] that is typically female, or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average [[clitoris]] ([[clitoral hypertrophy]]), or typically male, masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average [[penis]] that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline ("[[hypospadic]]"), and empty scrotum.

Fertility is variable. According to some,<ref>W. S. Alexander M.D., O. D. Beresford M.D,. M.R.C.P. (1953) wrote about extensively about 'female pseudohermaphrodite' origins in utera, in his paper MASCULINIZATION OF OVARIAN ORIGIN, published An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Volume 60 Issue 2 pp. 252–258, April 1953.</ref><ref>Am J Psychiatry 164:1499–1505, October 2007: Noted Mayo Clinic researchers J.M.

Found here: http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC1702.HTM</ref> are vestiges of outdated 19th century thinking. According to others, the terms "male pseudohermaphrodite", and "female pseudohermaphrodite" are used to define the gender in terms of the [[histology]] (microscopic appearance) of the [[gonad]]s.<ref name="isbn0-7817-9485-4">{{cite book |author=Langman, Jan; Thomas Sadler |title=Langman's medical embryology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2006 |page=252 |isbn=0-7817-9485-4 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

====="True hermaphroditism"=====
A "[[true hermaphrodite]]" is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue.

In 2003, researchers at [[UCLA]] published their studies of a lateral [[gynandromorph]]ic hermaphroditic [[zebra finch]], which had a testicle on the right and an ovary on the left. Its entire body was split down the middle between female and male, with hormones from both gonads running through the blood.<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | date = 2003-04-15 | volume = 100 | issue = 8 | pages = 4873–4878 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0636925100 | pmc = 153648 | title = Neural, not gonadal, origin of brain sex differences in a gynandromorphic finch | author = Robert J. Agate, William Grisham, Juli Wade, Suzanne Mann, John Wingfield, Carolyn Schanen, Aarno Palotie, and Arthur P. Arnold | pmid = 12672961 }}</ref> This is an example of [[mosaicism]] or [[chimerism]].

This extreme example of hermaphroditism is quite rare.

=====Ovotestes=====
Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of [[ovotestis|ovotestes]]. The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of [[streak gonads]]. Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male," and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development."<ref name="titleovo-testes">{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/conditions/ovo-testes |title=ovo-testes (formerly called "true hermaphroditism") | work=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2007-12-09 |format= }}</ref>

Intersex activist [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] is an example of someone with ovotestes.<ref name="weil">Weil, Elizabeth (September, 2006). [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html What if It's (Sort of) a Boy and (Sort of) a Girl?] ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.</ref>

====Other diagnostic signs====
In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed:

For instance, a [[karyotype]] display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.

===Management===
Clinical management of intersex can be categorized into one of the following two:<ref>[http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/26/5/413 Enhancing Human Traits: Ethical and Social Implications] Edited by Erik Parens, Washington DC, Georgetown University Press, 1998.</ref>

#Treatments: Restore functionality (or potential functionality)
#Enhancements: Give the ability to identify with “mainstream” people, e.g., [[breast enlargement surgery]]
However, there are other categorization systems of management of intersex, which falls into neither category.<ref name=holmes>Holmes M. (2002). Rethinking the Meaning and Management of Intersexuality. Sexualities, 159–180."</ref>

In any case, the most common procedure is surgery.

====Surgery====
The exact procedure of the surgery depends on what is the cause of a less common body phenotype in the first place. There is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. A traditional approach to the management of intersexuality has been surgery. However, some<ref name=holmes/> (Alice Dreger) say that surgical treatment is socially motivated and, hence, ethically questionable; without evidence, doctors regularly assume that intersex persons cannot have a clear gender identity. This is often taken further with parents of intersex babies advised that without surgery their child will be stigmatized. Further, since almost all such surgeries are undertaken to fashion female genitalia for the child, it is more difficult for the child to present as male if they later find they identify as or are genetically male. 20-50% of surgical cases result in a loss of sexual sensation (Newman 1991, 1992).

Typically, surgery is performed at birth. Intersex advocates such as Anne Fausto-Sterling in her ''Sexing the Body'' argue surgery on intersex babies should wait until the child can make an informed decision, and label surgery without consent as [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]].

===Causes===

====Typical sex development====
{{Main|Sexual differentiation}}
The common pathway of [[sexual differentiation]], where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.

During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo.<ref name="Kolodny"/> During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable," with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state," may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events.<ref name="Kolodny"/> Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.

At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately Week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the [[Müllerian duct|Müllerian duct system]] develops into the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tubes]], and inner third of the vagina.
In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone [[Anti-Müllerian hormone|MIH]] causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the [[Wolffian duct|Wolffian duct system]], which develops into the [[vas deferens]], seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.<ref name="Kolodny">{{Cite book

By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.

====Conditions====
{{Refimprove section|date = April 2010}}
The final body appearance does not always correspond with what is dictated by the genes. In other words, there is sometimes an incongruity between genetic (or chromosomal) and phenotypic (or physical appearance) sex. Citing medical research regarding other factors that influence sexual differentiation, the [[Intersex Society of North America]] challenges the [[XY sex-determination system]]'s assumption that chromosomal sex is the determining factor of a person's "true" biological sex.<ref name="ISNA3">Intersex Society of North America (May 24, 2006).

|-
| '''X/Y''' || '''Name''' || '''Description'''
 |-
 | XX || [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) || The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the [[adrenal gland]]s produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero

In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]], which is the most common form of CAH.

Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17α-hydroxylase deficiency]] are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.

See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.
 |-
 | XX || [[Progestin-induced virilisation]] || In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by use of [[progestin]], a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males.<ref name=hplace>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthyplace.com/communities/gender/intersexuals/intersexuality_faq.htm#anchor777213 |title=2000 Intersex Society of North America – What is Progestin Induced Virilisation? |publisher=Healthyplace.com |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>
 |-
 | XX || [[Freemartin]]ism || This condition occurs commonly in all species of [[Bovinae|cattle]] and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the [[placenta]]e of [[fraternal twins]] usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a ''freemartin'' is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a [[Castration|castrated]] male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs{{spaced ndash}}in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.
 |-
 | XY || [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) || People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees.

Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a [[vagina]] and no [[uterus]], [[cervix]], or [[ovaries]], and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.

In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as [[clitoromegaly]], or a small penis, which is called [[micropenis]] or microphallus; hypospadias and [[cryptorchidism]] may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.
 |-
 | XY || [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5-ARD) || The condition affects individuals with a [[Y chromosome]], making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |title=eMedicine article on 5-ARD |publisher=Emedicine.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.
 |-
 | XY || [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) || In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency]], CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.
 |-
 | XY || [[Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome]] (PMDS) || The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce [[Müllerian inhibiting factor]] during fetal development.
 |-
 | XY || [[Anorchia]] || Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with Anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce [[gamete]]s necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to [[gender dysphoria]], as anorchic individuals are typically [[sex assignment|assigned male at birth]].
 |-
|XY||Gonadal Dysgenesis|| It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. <br/> It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whos gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous.<ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000 52">{{cite book|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|pages=52|author=Anne Fausto-Sterling|authorlink=Of Gender and Genitals}}</ref> 
|-
|XY||[[Hypospadias]]|| It is caused by various causes,including alterations in testosterone metabolism.<br/>	The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis.<ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000 52"/> 
|-
 | Other || Unusual chromosomal sex || In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example [[Turner syndrome]] ([[Turner syndrome|XO]]), [[Triple X syndrome]] ([[Triple-X syndrome|XXX]]), [[Klinefelter's Syndrome]], ([[Klinefelter's Syndrome|XXY/XXXY]]), [[XYY syndrome]] ([[XYY syndrome|XYY]]), [[XX male syndrome|de la Chapelle syndrome]] ([[XX male]]), [[Swyer syndrome]] ([[Swyer syndrome|XY female]]), and there are many other individuals who do not follow the typical patterns (such as individuals with four or even more sex chromosomes).
 |-
 | Other || [[Mosaicism]] and [[chimerism]] || A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either [[mosaicism]] or [[chimerism]]. In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos.

In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other.<ref name="pmid991437">{{cite journal |author=De Marchi M, Carbonara AO, Carozzi F, ''et al.'' |title=True hermaphroditism with XX/XY sex chromosome mosaicism: report of a case |journal=Clin.

However, not all cases of mosaicism and chimerism involve intersex.

===Hermaphrodite===
{{Main|Hermaphrodite}}
A [[hermaphrodite]] is a plant or animal that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex".<ref name="Cawadias, A. P. 1943">Cawadias, A. P. (1943) ''Hermaphoditus the Human Intersex'', London, Heinemann Medical Books Ltd.</ref> 

Currently, however, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation, as well as social self-identification. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals can be stigmatizing and misleading.<ref>http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite</ref>

===Transgender===

The term [[transgender]] describes the condition in which one's [[gender identity]] does not match one's assigned sex. Some individuals may be both intersex and transgender but the two terms are not equivalent.<ref>http://www.isna.org/faq/transgender</ref>

===Disorders of sex development===
{{Main|Disorders of sex development }}
"[[Disorders of sex development]]" (DSD) is a term that has both supporters and opponents. It is defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical.

A number of critics of traditional terminology, including the now defunct [[Intersex Society of North America]], intersex activists, and some medical experts moved to eliminate the term "intersex" in medical usage, replacing it with disorders of sex development in order to avoid conflating anatomy with identity.<ref name="ISNADSD">Intersex Society of North America (May 24, 2006).

Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy.<ref>Feder, E.

==Intersex people in society==

===History===
Intersex people are treated in different ways by different cultures. In some cultures, such people were included in larger "[[third gender]]" or gender-blending social roles along with other individuals. In most societies, intersex people have been expected to conform to either a female or a male [[gender role]].<ref>Gagnon and Simon 1973.</ref> Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as an emergency once they were born. The parents of the intersex babies were not content about the situation. Psychologists, sexologists, and researchers had a theory that it was better if the baby's genitalia were changed when they were younger than when they were a mature adult. The scientist thought that helped with the confusion.<ref>Fausto-Sterling,"of gender and genitals" from Sexing the Body</ref>  

Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. An example is one of the [[Sumer]]ian [[creation myth]]s from more than 4,000 years ago. The story has [[Ninmah]], a [[mother goddess]], fashioning mankind out of clay.<ref name="titleThe Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature">{{cite web |url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.1.2# |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |accessdate=2007-12-09 |format= |work=}}</ref> She boasts that she will determine the fate – good or bad – for all she fashions. [[Enki]], the father god, retorts as follows.

:Enki answered Ninmah: "I will counterbalance whatever fate – good or bad – you happen to decide." Ninmah took clay from the top of the ''abzu'' [ab = water, zu = far] in her hand and she fashioned from it first a man who could not bend his outstretched weak hands. Enki looked at the man who cannot bend his outstretched weak hands, and decreed his fate: he appointed him as a servant of the king.

:... [Three men and one woman with atypical biology are formed and Enki gives each of them various forms of status to ensure respect for their uniqueness] ...

: Sixth, she fashioned one with neither penis nor vagina on its body. Enki looked at the one with neither penis nor vagina on its body and gave it the name ''Nibru'' [eunuch(?)], and decreed as its fate to stand before the king."

During the [[Victorian era]], medical authors introduced the terms "true hermaphrodite" for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, verified under a microscope, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. In Europe, the term 'intersexual' was first to be used before the Second World War.<ref>Hirschfeld, M. (1923) 'Die Intersexuelle Konstitution.' Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen, 23, 3–27.</ref><ref>Voss, Heinz-Juergen: Sex In The Making - A Biological Account. Online: http://DasEndeDesSex.blogsport.de/images/voss_2011_sex_in_the_making.pdf</ref> The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' came from British specialist Cawadias in the 1940s.<ref name="Cawadias, A. P. 1943"/> This suggestion was taken up by specialists in the UK during the 1960s, by both those who rejected Money's framework (then emerging from the USA),<ref>Armstrong, C. N. (1964) "Intersexuality in Man", IN ARMSTRONG, C. N. & MARSHALL, A. J. (Eds.) ''Intersexuality in Vertebrates Including Man'', London, New York, Academic Press Ltd.</ref> and those who endorsed that approach.<ref>Dewhurst, S. J. & Gordon, R. R. (1969) ''The Intersexual Disorders'', London, Baillière Tindall & Cassell.</ref>

Since the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Since the advancements in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all.<ref>Alice Domurat Dreger, "Ambiguous Sex"--or Ambivalent Medicine?", ''The Hastings Center Report'' May/June 1998, Volume 28, Issue 3, pp. 24–35.</ref> Contemporary social activists, scientists and health practitioners, among others, have begun to revisit the issue.  Awareness of the existence of physical sexual variation in human beings has increased.

Some groups, such as [[Intersex Society of North America|ISNA]], and some clinicians, such as those at University College Hospital London, have questioned the practice of performing [[intersex surgery|genital corrective surgery]] on intersex children.  Dialogue between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations.<ref>Richard Ekins, ''Male Femaling: A Grounded Theory Approach to Cross-dressing and Sex-changing'', New York: Routledge 1997, p. 55-M.</ref><ref>Marjorie Garber, ''Vested Interests: Crossdressing and Cultural Anxiety'', New York: Routledge 1992, p. 101.</ref> There are intersex groups, such as [[Organisation Intersex International|OII]], who argue that the various degrees of intersex are natural human variations that should not be subject to correction. 

There are not many available cases concerning children with intersex conditions, but one important one that has led the way into changing the framework of how children of intersex conditions should be treated was the Colombian Case.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Skyler|title=Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Development: The Constitutional Issues Created by the Surgical Treatment of Intersex Children|journal=McGeorge Law Review|year=2010-2011|volume=42|pages=863|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcglr42&div=66&g_sent=1&collection=journals|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> The case has significantly reduced the power doctors and parents have to decide surgical procedures on the children's ambiguous genitalia.  
By the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]], on Case 1 Part 1 (SU-337 of 1999), doctors are obligated to inform parents on all the aspects of the intersex child. Parents can only consent to surgery, if they have received accurate information,  and consent can not be given after the child reaches an age of five. By then the child will have, supposedly, realized their gender identity. .<ref>{{cite web|title=Corte Constitucional de Colombia: Sentencia T-1025/02|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2002/t-1025-02.htm|accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> The court case has led to setting legal guidelines to how doctor's surgical practice on intersex children.

The writer [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] [[neologism|coined]] the words ''herm'' (for "true hermaphrodite"), ''merm'' (for "male pseudo-hermaphrodite"), and ''ferm'' (for "female pseudo-hermaphrodite"), and proposed that these be recognized as sexes along with female and male. Her terms were "tongue-in-cheek"; she no longer advocates these terms even as a rhetorical device.  The activist [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] criticized these terms in a letter to ''[[The Sciences]]'', also criticizing the traditional standard of medical care.  Chase announced the creation of the [[Intersex Society of North America]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Sociological approaches===
The first sociologist to work on 'intersexuality' was [[Harold Garfinkel]] in 1967 using a method derived from [[Phenomenology (psychology)|sociological phenomenology]] he called [[ethnomethodology]]. He based his analysis on the everyday commonsense understandings of 'Agnes', a woman undergoing social and surgical gender reassignment.<ref>{{Cite book

|title = Studies in ethnomethodology

|publisher = Prentice-Hall
}}</ref> Ethnomethodology was also used in 1978 by Kessler and McKenna, who argue that, while gender can be seen as a social accomplishment, cross-cultural studies render gender as problematic as they highlight how it is usually regarded as a fact, when it can be shown to be constructed in different ways. They point to different cultural approaches to gender roles, and how 'hermaphrodites' and 'berdaches' are incorporated socially, as disruptive to fixed ideas about sex, gender, and gender-roles. They argue that what we 'know' about gender is grounded in the 'everyday social construction of a world of two genders', where gender attribution seems more important than gender differentiation.<ref>{{Cite book

===Recent debates===

====Gender and sexual self-identification====
Some people with intersex conditions self-identify as intersex, and some do not.<ref>Sharon Preves, "Intersex and Identity, the Contested Self". Rutgers, 2003.</ref><ref>Catherine Harper, "Intersex". Berg, 2007.</ref>

====Surgery====
Depending on the type of intersex condition, surgery may be performed for aesthetic or social purposes. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a [[cleft lip]] (as opposed to a [[cleft palate]]), genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life (such as loss of sensation in the genitals, for example, when a [[clitoris]] deemed too large or penile is reduced/removed), or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability, which may have been avoided without the surgery. In other cases, negative consequences may be avoided with surgery.

Opponents maintain that there is no compelling evidence that the presumed social benefits of such "normalizing" surgery outweigh the potential costs.<ref name="ISNA4">Intersex Society of North America (May 24, 2006). [http://www.isna.org/faq/healthy What evidence is there that you can grow up psychologically healthy with intersex genitals (without "normalizing" surgeries)?]. Retrieved 25 November 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300 | work=BBC News | title=Health Check: The boy who was raised a girl | date=2010-11-23}}</ref> Opponents claim this led to the degrading interpretation that females are essentially castrated males. This view overlooks the embryological origin of the penis/clitoris.

Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially.  The child was seen to be in need of correction in order to be socially accepted in the future.  However the situation proved to be far more complex than was originally thought.  In the first surgeries, parents were not often consulted on the decision-making process when choosing the sex of the child. Doctors took it upon themselves to decide what was best based on certain forms of evidence, such as hormonal levels, or other extreme forms. Biologist Anne Fausto Sterling states that in the past doctors would decide if the sex were to be male or female based on the measurements of the penis or the clitoris.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=Chapter 3|pages=44–77}}</ref> For example in one study of 100 newborn males, those with penises measuring in at 2.9 to 4.5 centimeters are deemed acceptable and therefore designated as male. However one that measured less than 1.5 centimeters would undergo a female assignment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sterlin|first=Anne|title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=Chapter 3|pages=44–77}}</ref>  The idea of the environment and social norms shaping the sex of the child was completely ignored.

However, many intersex individuals have resented the medical intervention, and some have been so discontented with their surgically assigned gender as to opt for [[sexual reassignment surgery]] later in life. The [[Declaration of Montreal]] first demanded prohibition of unnecessary post-birth surgery to reinforce gender assignment until a child is old enough to understand and give [[informed consent]]. This was detailed in the context of existing UN declarations and conventions under Principle 18 of [[The Yogyakarta Principles]], which called on states to:

{{Quotation|
B. Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure that no child’s body is irreversibly altered by medical procedures in an attempt to impose a gender identity without the full, free and informed consent of the child in accordance with the age and maturity of the child and guided by the principle that in all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration;<br>
<br>
C. Establish child protection mechanisms whereby no child is at risk of, or subjected to, medical abuse;|The Yogyakarta Principles}}

Intersex advocates and experts have critiqued the necessity of early interventions, citing individual's experiences of intervention and the lack of follow-up studies showing clear benefits. Specialists at the Intersex Clinic at University College London began to publish evidence in 2001 that indicated the harm that can arise as a result of inappropriate interventions, and advised minimising the use of childhood surgical procedures.<ref>Sarah M Creighton, Catherine L Minto, Stuart J Steele, "Objective cosmetic and anatomical outcomes at adolescence of feminising surgery for ambiguous genitalia done in childhood" (Lancet 2001; 358:124-25).</ref><ref>Sarah M Creighton, "Editorial: Surgery for Intersex" (Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 2001; 94:218–220).</ref><ref>Sarah M Creighton, Catherine L Minto, Christopher Woodhouse, "Long term sexual function in intersex conditions with ambiguous genitalia" (Journal of Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology 2001; 14:141–142).</ref><ref>Sarah M Creighton, Catherine L Minto, Stuart J Steele, "Cosmetic and anatomical outcomes following feminising childhood surgery for intersex conditions" (Journal of Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology 2001; 14:142).</ref><ref>Sarah M Creighton, Catherine L Minto, "Sexual function in adult women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome" (Journal of Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology 2001; 14:144–145).</ref><ref>Sarah M Creighton, Catherine Minto, "Managing intersex: Most vaginal surgery in childhood should be deferred" (BMJ 2001; 323:1264–1265).</ref><ref>Catherine L Minto, Lih-Mei Liao, Christopher RJ Woodhouse, Phillip G Ransley, Sarah M Creighton, "The effect of clitoral surgery on sexual outcome in individuals who have intersex conditions with ambiguous genitalia: a cross-sectional study" (Lancet 2003; 361:1252–1257).</ref><ref>Sarah Creighton, Philip Ransley, Patrick Duffy, Duncan Wilcox, Imran Mushtaq, Peter Cuckow, Christopher Woodhouse, Catherine Minto, Naomi Crouch, Richard Stanhope, Ieuan Hughes, Mehul Dattani, Peter Hindmarsh, Caroline Brain, John Achermann, Gerard Conway, Lih Mei Liao, Angela Barnicoat, and Les Perry, "Regarding the Consensus Statement on 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency from the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and The European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology" (Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 2003; 88:3455).</ref><ref>Catherine L Minto, Lih-Mei Liao, Gerald S Conway, Sarah M Creighton, "Sexual function in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome" (Fertility and Sterility 2003; 80 157–164).</ref><ref>Naomi S Crouch, Catherine L Minto, Lih-Mei Liao, Christopher R J Woodhouse, Sarah M Creighton, "Genital sensation after feminizing genitoplasty for congenital adrenal hyperplasia: a pilot study" (BJU International 2004; 93:135–138).</ref>

Studies done on individuals with intersex conditions or DSDS, have revealed how surgical intervention has had psychological effects, leading to the impact on well being and quality of life. Genitoplasty, plastic surgery done on the genitalia, does not ensure a successful psychological outcome for the patient and might require psychological support when the patient is trying to distinguish a gender identity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome: Sexuality, Psychological Effects, and Quality of Life|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083318808003306|publisher=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|author=E.J. Bean|coauthors=T. Mazur, A.D. Robinson,}}</ref> Other than the possible negative psychological outcomes, surgeries, like with a [[vaginoplasty]], can have physical outcomes, one common one being scarring, which can be a factor to insensitivity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|pages=85–86}}</ref> Other cases where vaginoplasty has caused complications, is that the implant or artificial vagina will not stay in place, or need further surgeries.<ref name="XXXY">{{cite web|title=XXXY|url=http://www.berkeleymedia.com/catalog/berkeleymedia/films/womens_studies_gender_studies/gay_lesbian_transgender_issues/xxxy}}</ref> One of the reasons there are many complications is doctors who do not specialize in genitoplasty or similar surgeries ([[phalloplasty]], vaginoplasty) usually reconstruct the child's ambiguous genitalia.

====Gender dysphoria====
The proposed revisions for [[DSM-5]] include a change from using [[Gender Identity Disorder]] to ''Gender Dysphoria''.  This revised code now specifically includes intersex people as people with [[Disorders of Sex Development]].<ref name="DSM5prop">[DSM-5 proposed revisions on GI(D)|http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=482]</ref>  This move has been criticised by one intersex advocacy group in Australia,<ref name="OIIA">[OII Australia Position Statement on DSM-5 proposals|http://oiiaustralia.com/organisation-intersex-international-position-statement-dsmv-draft-february-2010/]</ref> and criticism from the intersex community has been lodged with the appropriate DSM5 subcommittee.<ref name="OIIDSM5">[[OII response to DSM5 GID proposals|http://www.intersexualite.org/DSM5.html]]</ref> The UK Intersex Association (UKIA) is also highly critical of the label ‘disorders’ and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. UKIA supports the suggestion put forward by Profs. Milton Diamond and Hazel Beh that the more neutral and less pathologising term "Variations of Sex Development" would be more appropriate in medical discussion.

===Intersex in popular culture===

====Books====

The Japanese manga series ''[[I.S. (manga)|I.S.]]'', first published in 2003, features intersexual characters and how they deal with intersex-related issues and influence the lives of people around them. 

In 2012  the character [[Shining Knight]] was revealed as [[DC Comics]]’s first intersex character in Demon Knights #14.<ref>http://www.gay.net/gaming-collectibles/2012/11/16/week-geek-dc-outs-first-intersex-superhero-minnie-mouse-works-runway</ref>

====Film====
The 1995 film ''Hermaphrodites Speak!'' is a 30 minute documentary film from the United States in which several intersex people at the first retreat of the [[Intersex Society of North America]] discuss their lives and the medical treatment and parenting they received.

In 2000, Porter Gale, Masters in Documentary Film and Video from Stanford University,and Laleh Soomekh, produced ''XXXY'', a documentary revealing the intersex individuals' opinions on the surgical procedures done on children with intersex conditions or DSDs, while providing a medical professional's opinion as well. The film clearly shows the dissatisfaction and the painful repercussions for the children who went through sex reassignment surgeries.<ref name="XXXY"/> 

In 2006, Ajae Clearway produced an award winning documentary giving voice to various intersex individuals and their experiences with surgeries, and advocates for informed consent. The film ''One in Two Thousand'' educates the viewer on notions of sexuality, and the opposition on unnecessary surgeries.<ref name="Fanlight Productions">{{cite web|title=One in 2000|url=http://www.fanlight.com/catalog/films/459_ots.php|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> 

The 2007 Argentine film ''[[XXY (film)|XXY]]'' centres around a young intersex person who is assisted in presenting as a girl with medication. The film deals with discrimination, sexuality and gender identity.

In 2010, Australian documentary-maker Phoebe Hart directed an autobiographical documentary of her personal experience as an intersex person. The film, ''[[Orchids, My Intersex Adventure]]'', explores the various social scenarios faced by many intersex individuals.

In 2012, the film ''Intersexion'' was awarded the Best Feature Documentary award at the [[Documentary Edge Festival]], hosted by [[Mani Bruce Mitchell]], CEO of the first Intersex Trust in the world (ITANZ). The film was directed by Grant Lahood. The film follows Mani as s/he visits intersex people in America, Ireland, Germany, South Africa and Australia.

====TV and Radio====
Intersex was discussed on British TV for the first time in 1966, and became a topic of interest for broadcast TV and radio in the United States and other countries from 1989.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the 2000 ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' episode "The Little Things", Ken has to deal with the discovery that his girlfriend had been born with ambiguous genitalia.

In the 2009 episode of [[House (TV series)|House]] entitled, "[[The Softer Side (House)|The Softer Side]]", a teenager with [[46, XX/XY|Genetic Mosaicism]] that is unaware of his (the gender his parents choose for him) condition develops [[dehydration]] and is admitted to Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. 

The 2012 ''[[Emily Owens, M.D.]]'' episode "Emily and... the Question of Faith" featured an intersex baby.<ref>http://www.afterellen.com/content/2012/11/emily-owens-md-recap-ep-6-god-and-gender</ref>

In the 2010 ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'' episode "Show Me on Montana", Drs. Flame and Maestro try to convince a hermaphrodite child which gender to choose, with each doctor vying for their own gender.

===Education===
In secondary schools, biology and sex education instructors often place most emphasis on the most common XX and XY genotypes. Thus, people nowadays may be more likely to look towards the sex chromosomes than, for example, the histology of the gonads. However, according to researcher Eric Vilain at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], "the biology of gender is far more complicated than XX or XY chromosomes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-02/dnnl-dma020305.php |title=Defining male and female |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=2005-02-18 |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Many different criteria have been proposed, and there is little consensus.<ref name="what">ISNA.
