'''John Julian Cuttance Wild''' (August 11, 1914 &ndash; September 18, 2009) was an [[England|English]]-born [[United States|American]] physician who was part of the first group to use [[ultrasound]] for body imaging, most notably for diagnosing cancer. Modern ultrasonic diagnostic medical scans are descendants of the equipment Wild and his colleagues developed in the 1950s.  He has been described as the "father of medical ultrasound".<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Watts | first1 = Geof | title = John Wild: Inventor of diagnostic ultrasound in medicine  | journal = BMJ  | volume = 339 | issue = 339 | pages = b4428 | month = Oct | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b4428}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Wild was born in [[Kent]], England on August 11, 1914. He attended [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in the City of London and took out his first [[patent]] at the age of 14, for a device to distribute hot and cold water evenly when filling a [[bathtub]].<ref>''[[Last Word]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 27 September 2009</ref> At the [[University of Cambridge]], he studied the [[Natural Sciences Tripos]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1936, followed by a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] in 1940 and became a [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1942.<ref name=NYTObit>Glaser, Vicki.

Accessed October 7, 2009.</ref> He was elected as a member of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] in 1944 and joined the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] that same year, leaving in 1945 with the  rank of major.<ref name=History>[http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/jjwildbio.html John J.

==Ultrasound==
He emigrated to the United States in 1946, taking a position at the [[University of Minnesota]]. After starting at the school's department of surgery, he shifted to the electrical engineering department in 1950. As a surgeon during [[World War II]] he had seen many patients who had suffered bowel failure experienced because of bomb explosions from German [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and had developed a technique called the "Wild tube" to deal with the problem.<ref name=WashPostObit/> After seeing patients in the U.S. with similar conditions, Wild conceived the idea of using ultrasound as a noninvasive means to determine the level of injuries suffered in the intestines of patients, with the sound bouncing back from the tissue identifying the thickness and resiliency of that portion of the intestine. He had developed the technique after having heard of high-frequency sounds being used as a means to identify cracks in tank armor.<ref name=NYTObit/> While the early machines operated at too low a resolution for the purpose of scanning the intestines, by 1951 he and Dr. John Reid gained access to equipment that operated at the 15 [[MHz]] range, providing the detail needed to scan internally and to distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissue. Wild and his team were able to take ultrasound scans of breast tissue that could be used as a noninvasive means to identify and diagnose tumors. Together with Reid, Wild developed tools for scanning rectal and vaginal tissues.<ref name=History/>

Their work was published in the journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' in March 1951<ref name="WILD-1951">{{Cite journal  | last1 = WILD | first1 = JJ. | last2 = NEAL | first2 = D. | title = Use of high-frequency ultrasonic waves for detecting changes of texture in living tissues. | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 6656 | pages = 655–7 | month = Mar | year = 1951 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(51)92403-8 | pmid = 14814827 }}</ref> and in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in March 1952.<ref name="WILD-1952">{{Cite journal  | last1 = WILD | first1 = JJ. | last2 = REID | first2 = JM. | title = Application of echo-ranging techniques to the determination of structure of biological tissues. | journal = Science | volume = 115 | issue = 2983 | pages = 226–30 | month = Feb | year = 1952 | doi = 10.1126/science.115.2983.226 | pmid = 14913217 }}</ref> Wild and Reid stated that they planned the "immediate application of echography to the detection of tumors in accessible sites in the living intact human organism" through the process of "record[ing] soft tissue structure by tracing the information obtained from a sound beam sweeping through the tissues onto a fluorescent television screen". They were credited in ''Diagnosis of Diseases of the Breast'' as "the first to develop equipment specifically designed for breast scanning", as well as "the first to differentiate between cystic and solid masses in the breast by means of ultrasonography".<ref name=NYTObit/>

Wild earned the 1991 [[Japan Prize]], with a cash prize of 10 million yen (then approximately US$370,000), in recognition for his innovations in the field of ultrasound imaging.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>Staff.

==Death==
A resident of [[St. Louis Park, Minnesota]], Wild died at age 95 on September 18, 2009 at the N. C. Little Memorial Hospice in [[Edina, Minnesota]] because of complications from a [[stroke]].<ref name=WashPostObit>Sullivan, Patricia.
