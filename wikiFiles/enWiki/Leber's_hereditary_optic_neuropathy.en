'''Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)''' or '''Leber optic atrophy''' is a [[Human mitochondrial genetics|mitochondrially inherited]] (mother to all offspring) degeneration of [[retina]]l [[ganglion cell]]s (RGCs) and their [[axon]]s that leads to an acute or subacute loss of central vision; this affects predominantly young adult males.  However, LHON is only transmitted through the mother as it is primarily due to [[mutation]]s in the mitochondrial (not nuclear) [[genome]] and only the [[ovum|egg]] contributes [[mitochondria]] to the [[embryo]]. LHON is usually due to one of three pathogenic mitochondrial [[DNA]] (mtDNA) [[point mutation]]s. These mutations are at [[nucleotide]] positions 11778 [[guanine|G]] to [[adenine|A]], 3460 [[guanine|G]] to [[adenine|A]] and 14484 [[thymine|T]] to [[cytosine|C]], respectively in the ND4, ND1 and ND6 subunit [[gene]]s of [[electron transfer chain|complex I]] of the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] chain in mitochondria.  Men cannot pass on the disease to their offspring.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bandelt HJ, Kong QP, Parson W, Salas A |title=More evidence for non-maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA? |journal=J.

==History==

This disease was first described by the German ophthalmologist [[ Theodor Leber|Theodor Leber]] (1840–1917) in 1871.<ref name=Leber1871>Leber T. Ueber hereditaere und congenital angelegte sehnervenleiden (1871) Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 17:249–291</ref> In this paper Leber described four families in which a number of young men suffered abrupt loss of vision in both eyes either simultaneously or sequentially. This disease was initially thought to be X linked but was subsequently shown to be mitochondrial.<ref name=Erickson1972>{{cite journal | author = Erickson RP | year = 1972 | title = Leber's optic atrophy, a possible example of maternal inheritance | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 348–349 }}</ref> The nature of the causative mutation was first identified in 1988 by Wallace ''et al.'' who discovered the [[guanine]] (G) to [[adenosine]] (A) mutation at nucleotide position 11778 in nine families.<ref name=Wallace1988>{{cite journal | author = Wallace DC, Singh G, Lott MT, Hodge JA, Schurr TG, Lezza AM, Elsas LJ 2nd, Nikoskelainen EK | year = 1988 | title = Mitochondrial DNA mutation associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy | url = | journal = Science | volume = 242 | issue = 4884| pages = 1427–1430 }}</ref> This mutation converts a highly conserved [[arginine]] to [[histidine]] at [[codon]] 340 in the [[NADH dehydrogenase]] subunit 4 of [[complex I]] of the [[mitochondria]]l respiratory chain.

==Signs & symptoms==
Clinically, there is an acute onset of visual loss, first in one [[human eye|eye]], and then a few weeks to months later in the other. Onset is usually young adulthood, but age range at onset from 7-75 is reported. The age of onset is slightly higher in females (range 19–55 years: mean 31.3 years) than males (range 15–53 years: mean 24.3). The male to female ratio varies between mutations: 3:1 for 3460 G>A, 6:1 for 11778 G>A and 8:1 for 14484 T>C.

This typically evolves to very severe [[optic atrophy]] and permanent decrease of [[visual acuity]]. Both eyes become affected either simultaneously (25% of cases) or sequentially (75% of cases) with a median inter-eye delay of 8 weeks. Rarely only one eye may be affected. In the acute stage, lasting a few weeks, the affected eye demonstrates an edematous appearance of the nerve fiber layer especially in the arcuate bundles and enlarged or telangectatic and tortuous peripapillary vessels (microangiopathy). The main features are seen on [[Fundus (eye)|fundus]] [[Fundoscopy|examination]], just before or subsequent to the onset of visual loss. A [[Marcus Gunn pupil|pupillary defect]] may be visible in the acute stage as well. Examination reveals decreased visual acuity, loss of [[color vision]] and a cecocentral [[scotoma]] on [[perimetry|visual field examination]].

"LHON Plus" is a name given to rare strains of the disorder with eye disease together with other conditions.<ref name="Nikoskelainen1995">{{cite journal |author=Nikoskelainen EK, Marttila RJ, Huoponen K, ''et al.'' |title=Leber's "plus": neurological abnormalities in patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy |journal=J.

==Genetics==
[[Image:Mitochondrial.jpg|thumb|right|Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy has a [[Human mitochondrial genetics|mitochondrial inheritance]] pattern.]]
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a condition related to changes in [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria have a distinct [[mitochondrial genome]] composed of mtDNA.

Mutations in the [[MT-ND1]], [[MT-ND4]], [[MT-ND4L]], and [[MT-ND6]] genes cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.<ref name="titleOMIM - LEBER OPTIC ATROPHY">{{OMIM|535000|LEBER OPTIC ATROPHY}}</ref> These genes code for the [[NADH dehydrogenase]] protein involved in the normal mitochondrial function of [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. Oxidative phosphorylation uses a series of four large multienzyme complexes, which are all embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane to convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy. Mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process to cause a variety of syndromes depending on the type of mutation and other factors. It remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

==Epidemiology==
In Northern European populations about one in 9000 people carry one of the three primary LHON mutations.<ref>{{cite journal

Genet. |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=333–9 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12518276 |pmc=379226 |doi=10.1086/346066 |url=}}</ref>

The LHON ND4 G11778A mutation dominates as the primary mutation in most of the world
with 70% of European cases  and 90% of Asian cases. Due to  a [[Founder effect]], the LHON ND6 T14484C mutation accounts for 86% of LHON cases in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].<ref name="pmid15954041">{{cite journal |author=Laberge AM, Jomphe M, Houde L, ''et al.'' |title=A "Fille du Roy" Introduced the T14484C Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy Mutation in French Canadians |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=313–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15954041 |doi=10.1086/432491 |pmc=1224533}}</ref>

More than 50 percent of males with a mutation and more than 85 percent of females with a mutation never experience vision loss or related medical problems. The particular mutation type may predict likelihood of [[penetrance]], severity of illness and probability of vision recovery in the affected. As a rule of thumb, a woman who harbors a homoplasmic primary LHON mutation has a ~40% risk of having an affected son and a ~10% risk of having an affected daughter. 

Additional factors may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use may be involved, although studies of these factors have produced conflicting results. Researchers are also investigating whether changes in additional genes, particularly genes on the X chromosome,<ref name="Hudson2007a">{{cite journal |author=Hudson G, Carelli V, Horvath R, Zeviani M, Smeets HJ, Chinnery PF |title=X-Inactivation patterns in females harboring mtDNA mutations that cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy |journal=Mol.

== Pathophysiology ==
The eye pathology is limited to the retinal ganglion cell layer especially the maculopapillary bundle. Degeneration is evident from the retinal ganglion cell bodies to the axonal pathways leading to the [[lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate nucleii]]. Experimental evidence reveals impaired glutamate transport and increased [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) causing [[apoptosis]] of retinal ganglion cells. Also, experiments suggest that normal non LHON affected retinal ganglion cells produce less of the potent [[superoxide]] [[free radical|radical]] than other normal central nervous system neurons.<ref>{{cite journal

These experiments may in part explain the death of LHON affected retinal ganglion cells in preference to other central nervous system neurons which also carry LHON affected mitochondria.

== Diagnosis and management ==

Without a known family history of LHON the diagnosis usually requires a [[Neuro-ophthalmologist|neuro-ophthalmological]] evaluation and blood testing for mitochondrial DNA assessment.<ref>[http://www.genetests.org/servlet/access?prg=j&db=genetests&site=gt&id=8888890&fcn=c&qry=2450&res=nous&res=nointl&key=8BaWvqtcN8XtG&show_flag=c GeneTests LHON search]</ref> It is  important to  exclude other possible  causes of vision loss and important associated  syndromes such as heart electrical conduction  system abnormalities.  The prognosis for those affected left untreated is almost always that of continued significant visual loss in  both eyes. Regular corrected [[visual acuity]] and [[perimetry]] checks are advised for follow up of affected individuals.  There is beneficial treatment available for some  cases of this disease especially  for   early onset disease.<ref name="Klopstock2011"/> Also, experimental  treatment  protocols are in  progress.<ref name="Shrader2011"/> [[Genetic counselling]] should be offered. Health and lifestyle  choices  should  be  reassessed   particularly  in   light  of   toxic and    nutritional  theories  of  gene  expression. Vision aides assistance and  work  rehabilitation should  be   used  to assist  in  maintaining   employment.

For those who are  carriers of a LHON mutation, preclinical markers may be used to monitor progress.<ref name="Sadun2006">{{cite journal

[[Optical coherence tomography]] can be used for more detailed study of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Red green [[color vision]] testing may detect losses. [[Contrast sensitivity]] may be diminished. There could be an abnormal [[electroretinogram]] or [[visual evoked potentials]]. [[Neuron-specific enolase]] and axonal heavy chain [[neurofilament]] blood markers may predict conversion to affected status.
 
Avoiding optic nerve toxins is generally advised, especially tobacco and alcohol. Certain prescription drugs are known to be a potential risk, so all drugs should be  treated  with suspicion and checked before use by those at risk. Ethambutol, in particular, has been implicated as triggering visual loss in carriers of LHON.  In fact, [[Toxic and Nutritional Optic Neuropathy|toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies]] may have overlaps with LHON in symptoms, mitochondrial mechanisms of disease and management.<ref name="Carelli2004">{{cite journal
