A '''mouth ulcer''' (also termed an '''oral ulcer''', or a '''mucosal ulcer''') is an [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]] that occurs on the [[mucous membrane]] of the [[oral cavity]]. More plainly, a mouth ulcer is a sore or open lesion in the mouth.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{cite web|last=Vorvick LJ, Zieve D.|title=Mouth ulcers on MedlinePlus|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001448.htm|publisher=A.D.A.M., Inc|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref> Mouth ulcers are very common, occurring in association with many diseases and by many different mechanisms, but usually there is no serious underlying cause. The two most common causes of oral ulceration are local trauma (e.g. rubbing from a sharp edge on a filling) and [[aphthous stomatitis]] ("canker sores"), a condition characterized by recurrent formation of oral ulcers for largely unknown reasons. Some consider ulcers on the lips or on the skin around the mouth to be included under the general term oral ulceration (e.g. an ulcer left by rupture of a blister caused by [[herpes labialis]], i.e. a cold sore). Mouth ulcers often cause pain and discomfort, and may alter the person's choice of food while healing occurs (e.g. avoiding acidic or spicy foods and beverages). They may occur singly or multiple ulcers may occur at the same time (a "crop" of ulcers). Once formed, the ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection. Rarely, a mouth ulcer that does not heal for many weeks may be a sign of [[oral cancer]].

==Definition==
[[File:Erosion excoriation ulcer 2.svg|thumbnail|right|Diagramatic representation of mucosal erosion (left), excoriation (center), and ulceration (right).]]
An '''ulcer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|l|s|ər}}; from [[Latin]] ''ulcus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] "ἕλκος" - ''elkos'', "wound") is a break in the skin or mucous membrane with loss of surface tissue, disintegration and [[necrosis]] of [[epithelium|epithelial tissue]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ulcer on Merriam-Webster medical dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/ulcer|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref> A ''mucosal ulcer'' is an ulcer which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane. An ulcer is a tissue defect which has penetrated the epithelial-[[connective tissue]] border, with its base at a deep level in the [[submucosa]], or even within muscle or [[periosteum]].<ref name="Loevy 1993" /> An ulcer is a deeper breech of the epithelium than an erosion or an excoriation, and involves damage to both epithelium and [[lamina propria]].<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" />

An ''[[Cutaneous condition#Primary lesions|erosion]]'' is a superficial breach of the epithelium, with little damage to the underlying [[lamina propria]].<ref name="OMF medicine textbook">{{cite book|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-443-06818-8|pages=131–139|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 14: Soreness and ulcers}}</ref> A ''mucosal erosion'' is an erosion which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane.

''[[Excoriation]]'' is a term sometimes used to describe a breach of the epithelium which is deeper than an erosion but shallower than an ulcer. This type of lesion is tangential to the [[rete pegs]] and shows punctiform (small pinhead spots) bleeding, caused by exposed [[capillary]] loops.<ref name="Loevy 1993">{{cite book|last=Loevy|first=Manfred Strassburg, Gerdt Knolle ; translated by Hannelore Taschini|title=Diseases of the Oral Mucosa : A Colour Atlas.|year=1993|publisher=Quintessence Pub. Co., U.S.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-86715-210-4|edition=2nd|page=32}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
Aphthous stomatitis or local trauma are very common causes of oral ulceration, the many other possible causes are all rare in comparison.

===Local trauma===
Most mouth ulcers that are not associated with [[recurrent aphthous stomatitis]] are caused by local trauma. The mucous membrane lining of the mouth is thinner than the skin, and easily damaged by mechanical, thermal (heat/cold), chemical or electrical means, or by irradiation.

====Mechanical====
Common causes of oral ulceration include rubbing on sharp edges of teeth, fillings, crowns, false teeth (dentures), braces ([[dental braces|orthodontic appliances]]). Accidental biting caused by a lack of awareness of painful stimuli in the mouth (following a [[local anesthetic]] e.g. during dental treatment) may cause ulceration which the person becomes aware of as the anesthetic wears off and the full sensation returns. Eating rough foods (e.g. potato chips) can damage the lining of the mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absent minded habit or as a type of deliberate [[self harm]] ([[Factitious disorder|factitious]] ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue or lips, rubbing a finger nail, pen or tooth pick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the [[Frenulum labii superioris|upper labial frenum]] may be a sign of [[child abuse]] (non-accidental injury).<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, when incidental [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of [[petroleum jelly]] to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.
The [[lingual frenum]] is vulnerable to ulceration by repeated friction during sexual activity. Ulceration of the lingual frenum caused by [[cunnilingus]] is horizontal, the lesion corresponding to the contact of the ventral tongue with the incisal edge of the mandibular incisor teeth when the tongue is in its most forward position. This type of lesion resolves in 7–10&nbsp;days, but may recur with repeated performances. Chronic ulceration at this site can cause linear fibrous hyperplasia. The incisal edges of the mandibular teeth can be smoothed to minimize the chance of trauma.<ref name="OMF path textbook">{{cite book|last=BW Neville, DD Damm, CM Allen, JE Bouquot|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-7216-9003-3|pages=253–284|edition=2.}}</ref>

====Electrical and thermal burns====
Electrical burns in the mouth are fairly common. They are usually caused by chewing on live electrical wiring. Saliva acts as a conducting medium and an electrical arc flows between the electrical source and the tissues, causing extreme heat and possible tissue destruction. Thermal burns usually result from placing hot food or beverages in the mouth. This may occur in those who eat or drink before a local anesthetic has worn off. The normal painful sensation is absent and a burn may occur. Microwave ovens sometimes produce food which is cold externally and very hot internally, and this has led to a rise in the frequency of intra-oral thermal burns. Thermal food burns are usually on the palate or posterior buccal mucosa, and appear as zones of erythema and ulceration with necrotic epithelium peripherally. Electrical burns more commonly affect the oral commissure (corner of the mouth). The lesions are usually initially painless, charred and yellow with little bleeding. Swelling then develops and by the fourth day following the burn the area becomes necrotic and the epithelium sloughs off.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /><!-- all this section supported by OMF path textbook, pp 258 -->

====Chemical injury====
Caustic chemicals may cause ulceration of the oral mucosa if they are of strong enough concentration and in contact for a sufficient length of time. The holding of medication in the mouth instead of swallowing it occurs mostly in children, those under psychiatric care, or simply because of a lack of understanding. Holding an [[asprin]] tablet next to a painful tooth in an attempt to relieve [[pulpitis]] (toothache) is common, and leads to epithelial necrosis. Chewable aspirin tablets also need to be swallowed, and the residue quickly cleared from the mouth. Other caustic medications include [[eugenol]] and [[chlorpromazine]]. [[Hydrogen peroxide]], used to treat gum disease, is also capable of causing epithelial necrosis at concentrations of 1-3%. [[Silver nitrate]], sometimes used for pain relief from aphthous ulceration, acts as a chemical cauterant and destroys nerve endings, but the mucosal damage is increased. [[Phenol]] is used during dental treatment as a cavity sterilizing agent and cauterizing material, and it is also present in some over the counter agents again intended to treat aphthous ulcerations. Mucosal necrosis has been reported to occur with concentrations of 0.5%. Other materials used in [[endodontics]] are also caustic, which is part of the reason why use of a [[Dental dam|rubber dam]] is now recommended.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /><!-- all this seciton supported by OMF path textbook, pp&nbsp;259–260 -->

====Irradiation====
As a result of [[radiotherapy]] to the mouth, radiation induced [[stomatitis]] may develop, which can be associated with mucosal erosions and ulceration. If the salivary glands are irradiated, there may also be [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth), making the oral mucosa more vulnerable to frictional damage as the lubricating function of saliva is lost, and mucosal [[atrophy]] (thinning) which makes a breech of the epithelium more likely. Radiation to the bones of the jaws causes damage to [[osteocyte]]s and impairs the blood supply. The affected hard tissues become hypovascular (reduced number of blood vessels), hypocellular (reduced numebr of cells) and hypoxic (low levels of oxygen). [[Osteoradionecrosis]] is the term for when such an area of irradiated bone does not heal from this damage. This usually occurs in the [[mandible]], and causes chronic pain and surface ulceration, sometimes resulting in non healing bone being exposed through a soft tissue defect. Prevention of osteradionecrosis is part of the reason why all teeth of questionable prognosis are removed before the start of a course of radiotherapy.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /><!-- all this seciton supported by OMF path textbook, pp&nbsp;263–264 -->

===Aphthous stomatitis===
[[Image:Mouth sore.JPG|thumb|An [[aphthous ulcer]] on the labial mucosa. Note erythematous halo surrounding lesion.]]
[[Aphthous stomatitis]] (also termed recurrent aphthous stomatits, RAS, and commonly called "canker sores") is a very common cause of oral ulceration. 10-25% of the general population suffer from this non-contagious condition. The appearance of aphthous stomatitis varies as there are 3 types, namely minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthous ulceration and herpetiform ulceration. Minor aphthous ulceration is the most common type, presenting with 1-6 small (2-4mm diameter), round/oval ulcers with a yellow-grey color and an erythematous (red) "halo". These ulcers heal with no permanent scarring in about 7–10&nbsp;days. Ulcers recur at intervals of about 1–4&nbsp;months. Major aphthous ulceration is less common than the minor type, but produces more severe lesions and symptoms. Major aphthous ulceration presents with larger (>1&nbsp;cm diameter) ulcers that take much longer to heal (10–40&nbsp;days) and may leave scarring. The minor and major subtypes of aphthous stomatitis usually produce lesions on the non-keratonized oral mucosa (i.e. the inside of the cheeks, lips, underneath the tongue and the [[floor of mouth]]), but less commonly major aphthous ulcers may occur in other parts of the mouth on keratinized mucosal surfaces. The least common type is herpetiform ulceration, so named because the condition resembles [[primary herpetic gingivostomatitis]]. Herpetiform ulcers begin as small blisters (vesicles) which break down into 2-3mm sized ulcers. Herpetiform ulcers appear in "crops" sometimes hundreds in number, which can coalesce to form larger areas of ulceration. This subtype may cause extreme pain, heals with scarring and may recur frequently. The exact cause of aphthous stomatitis is unknown, but there may be a genetic predisposition in some people. Other possible causes include [[hematinic]] deficiency ([[folate]], [[vitamin B]], [[iron]]), stopping smoking, [[stress (psychological)|stress]], [[menstruation]], trauma, food [[allergy|allergies]] or hypersensitivity to [[sodium lauryl sulphate]] (found in many brands of [[toothpaste]]). Aphthous stomatitis has no clinically detectable signs or symptoms outside the mouth, but the recurrent ulceration can cause much discomfort to sufferers. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pain and swelling and speeding healing, and may involve systemic or topical [[steroid]]s, [[analgesic]]s (pain killers), [[antiseptic]]s, [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]] or barrier pastes to protect the raw area(s).<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" />

===Infection===

Many infections can cause oral ulceration (see table). The most common is [[Herpes simplex]] virus ([[herpes labialis]], [[primary herpetic gingivostomatitis]]), [[Varicella zoster virus|Varicella Zoster]] ([[chicken pox]], [[shingles]]) and [[coxsackie A virus]] ([[hand, foot and mouth disease]]). [[Human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) creates immunodeficiencies which allow opportunistic infections or neoplasms to proliferate. Bacterial processes leading to ulceration can be caused by  ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' ([[tuberculosis]]) and ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' ([[syphilis]]). Opportunistic activity by combinations of otherwise normal bacterial flora, such as aerobic streptococi, ''Neisseria'', ''Actinomyces'', spirochetes, and ''Bacteroides'' species can prolong the ulcerative process. Fungal causes include ''Coccidioides immitis'' ([[valley fever]]), ''Cryptococcus neoformans'' ([[cryptococcosis]]), ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]'' ("North American [[Blastomycosis]]").<ref name="Contemp Oral path">{{Cite book

===Malignant neoplasms===
[[File:PLoS oral cancer.png|right|thumb|Advanced [[oral cancer]]. Note rolled margins of central ulcer and surrounding areas of [[premalignant]] change]]
Rarely, a persistent, non healing mouth ulcer may be a [[cancer]]ous lesion (see: [[oral cancer]]). Malignancies in the mouth are usually [[carcinoma]]s, but [[lymphoma]]s, [[sarcoma]]s and others may also be possible. Either the tumor arises in the mouth, or it may grow to involve the mouth, e.g. from the [[maxillary sinus]], [[salivary gland]]s, [[nasal cavity]] or peri-oral skin. The most common type of oral cancer is [[squamous cell carcinoma]]. The main causes are long term [[smoking]] and [[alcohol]] consumption (particularly together) and [[betel]] use. Common sites of oral cancer are the lower lip, the floor of the mouth, and the sides and underside of the tongue, but it is possible to have a tumor anywhere in the mouth. Appearances vary greatly, but a typical malignant ulcer would be a persistent, expanding lesion which is totally red ([[erythroplasia]]) or speckled red and white (erythroleukoplakia). Malignant lesions also typically feel [[induration|indurated]] (hardened) and attached to adjacent structures, with "rolled" margins or a punched out appearance and bleeds easily on gentle manipulation.<ref name="Contemp OMFS textbook">{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=editors, James R. Hupp, Edward Ellis, Myron R.|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-04903-0|edition=5th|page=433}}</ref>

===Other causes===
A wide range of [[systemic disease]]s may cause mouth ulcers. [[hematologic disorder|Hematological]] causes include [[anemia]], [[hematinic]] deficiencies, [[neutropenia]], [[hypereosinophilic syndrome]], [[leukemia]], [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]s, other white cells [[dyscrasia]]s and [[gammopathy|gammopathies]]. [[Gastrointestinal disorder|Gastrointestinal]] causes include [[celiac disease]], [[Crohn's disease]] ([[orofacial granulomatosis]]), and [[ulcerative colitis]].  [[Cutaneous condition|Dermatological]] causes include [[chronic ulcerative stomatitis]], [[dermatitis herpetiformis]], [[epidermolysis bullosa]], [[erythema multiforme]] (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), [[Angina bullosa haemorrhagica]], [[lichen planus]], [[linear IgA disease]], [[pemphigoid]] and [[pemphigus vulgaris]]. Other examples of systemic disease capable of causing mouth ulcers include [[lupus erythematosus]], [[Sweet syndrome]], [[Reiter syndrome]], [[Behçet syndrome]], [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], [[periarteritis nodosa]], [[giant cell arteritis]], [[diabetes]], [[glucagonoma]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis]].<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" />

The conditions [[Eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa|eosinophilic ulcer]] and [[necrotizing sialometaplasia]] may present as oral ulceration.

[[Macroglossia]], an abnormally large tongue, can be associated with ulceration if the tongue protrudes constantly from the mouth.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> <!-- p.9 --> [[Caliber persistent artery]] describes a common vascular anomaly where a main arterial branch extends into superficial submucosal tissues without a reduction of diameter. This commonly occurs in elderly people on the lip and may be associated with ulceration.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> <!-- p.15 -->

==Pathophysiology==

The exact pathogenesis is dependent upon the cause. Ulcers and erosions can be the result of a spectrum of conditions including those causing auto-immune epithelial damage, damage because of an immune defect (e.g. HIV, [[leukemia]], infections e.g. [[Herpesviridae|herpes viruses]]) or nutritional disorders (e.g. vitamin deficiencies). Simple mechanisms which predispose the mouth to trauma and ulceration are [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth - as saliva usually lubricates the mucous membrane and controls bacterial levels) and epithelial atrophy (thinning, e.g. after [[radiotherapy]]), making the lining more fragile and easily breached.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook">{{cite book|last=Tyldesley|first=Anne Field, Lesley Longman in collaboration with William R.|title=Tyldesley's Oral medicine|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-263147-0|pages=7–8, 25, 35, 41, 43–44, 51–56|edition=5th}}</ref>{{rp|7}} [[Stomatitis]] is a general term meaning inflammation within the mouth, and often may be associated with ulceration.<ref name="Cawson Oral Path textbook">{{cite book|last=RA Cawson, EW Odell, S Porter|title=Cawson's essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine.|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-443-07106-3|pages=178–191|edition=7.}}</ref> Pathologically, the mouth represents a transition between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin, meaning that many gastrointestinal and cutaneous conditions can involve the mouth. Some conditions usually associated with the whole gastrointestinal tract may present only in the mouth, e.g. [[orofacial granulomatosis]]/oral [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name="Zbar 2012">{{cite journal|last=Zbar AP, Ben-Horin S, Beer-Gabel M, Eliakim R.|title=Oral Crohn's disease: is it a separable disease from orofacial granulomatosis?

The different conditions mean that many conditions which produce characteristic lesions on the skin produce only non specific lesions in the mouth.<ref name="Burket OM textbook">{{cite book|last=Glick|first=Martin S. Greenberg, Michael|title=Burket's oral medicine diagnosis & treatment|year=2003|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton, Ont.|isbn=1-55009-186-7|pages=50–79|edition=10th}}</ref> The vesicles and bullae of blistering mucocutaneous disorders progress quickly to ulceration in the mouth, because of moisture and trauma from food and teeth. The high bacterial load in the mouth means that ulcers may become secondarily infected. Cytotoxic drugs administered during chemotherapy target cells with fast turnovers such as malignant cells. However, the epithelia of the mouth also has a high turnover rate and makes oral ulceration a common side effect of chemotherapy.

Erosions, which involve the epithelial layer, are red in appearance since the underlying lamina propria shows through. When the full thickness of the epithelium is penetrated (ulceration), the lesion becomes covered with a [[fibrin]]ous [[exudate]] and takes on a yellow-grey color. Because an ulcer is a breach of the normal lining, when seen in cross section, the lesion is a crater. A "halo" may be present, which is a reddening of the surrounding mucosa and is caused by inflammation. There may also be [[edema]] (swelling) around the ulcer. Chronic trauma may produce an ulcer with a [[keratosis|keratotic]] (white, thickened mucosa) margin.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> Malignant lesions may ulcerate either because the tumor infiltrates the mucosa from adjacent tissues, or because the lesion originates within the mucosa itself, and the disorganized growth leads to a break in the normal architecture of the lining tissues. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an [[immunodeficiency]], signaling low levels of [[immunoglobulin]] in the oral mucous membranes. [[Chemotherapy]], [[HIV]], and [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]] are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation. [[Autoimmunity]] is also a cause of oral ulceration. [[Mucous membrane pemphigoid]], an autoimmune reaction to the epithelial [[basement membrane]], causes [[desquamation]]/ulceration of the oral mucosa.
Numerous aphthous ulcers could be indicative of an inflammatory autoimmune disease called [[Behçet's disease]]. This can later involve skin lesions and [[uveitis]] in the eyes. [[Vitamin C]] deficiency may lead to [[scurvy]] which impairs wound healing, which can contribute to ulcer formation.<ref name="Contemp Oral path" /> For a detailed discussion of the pathophysiology of aphthous stomatitis, see [[Aphthous stomatitis#Causes]].

==Diagnostic approach==
Diagnosis of mouth ulcers usually consists of a medical history followed by an oral examination as well as examination of any other involved area. The following details may be pertinent: The duration that the lesion has been present, the location, the number of ulcers, the size, the color and whether it is hard to touch, bleeds or has a rolled edge. As a general rule, a mouth ulcer that does not heal within 2 or 3&nbsp;weeks should be examined by a health care professional who is able to rule out oral cancer (e.g. a [[dentist]], [[oral medicine|oral physician]], [[oral surgeon]]/ [[maxillofacial surgeon]]).<ref name=MedlinePlus /><ref name="Scully 2000">{{cite journal|last=Scully|first=C|coauthors=Shotts, R|title=ABC of oral health. Mouth ulcers and other causes of orofacial soreness and pain|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2000 Jul 15|volume=321|issue=7254|pages=162–5|pmid=10894697|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7254.162|pmc=1118165}}</ref>  If there have been previous ulcers which have healed, then this again makes cancer unlikely. An ulcer that keeps forming on the same site and then healing may be caused by a nearby sharp surface, and ulcers that heal and then recur at different sites are likely to be RAS. Malignant ulcers are likely to be single in number, and conversely, multiple ulcers are very unlikely to be oral cancer. The size of the ulcers may be helpful in distinguishing the types of RAS, as can the location (minor RAS mainly occurs on non-keratonizing mucosa, major RAS occurs anywhere in the mouth or oropharynx). Induration, contact bleeding and rolled margins are features of a malignant ulcer. There may be nearby causative factor, e.g. a broken tooth with a sharp edge that is traumatizing the tissues. Otherwise, the person may be asked about problems elsewhere, e.g. ulceration of the genital mucous membranes,<ref name="Keogan 2009">{{cite journal|last=Keogan|first=MT|title=Clinical Immunology Review Series: an approach to the patient with recurrent orogenital ulceration, including Behçet's syndrome|journal=Clinical and experimental immunology|date=2009 Apr|volume=156|issue=1|pages=1–11|pmid=19210521|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03857.x|pmc=2673735}}</ref> eye lesions or digestive problems, swollen glands in neck ([[lymphadenopathy]]) or a  general unwell feeling. The diagnosis comes mostly from the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (vitamin deficiency, anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or [[urinalysis]] (diabetes). A [[biopsy]] (minor procedure to cut out a small sample of the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without [[immunofluorescence]] may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch and sore. They usually have an irregular border with erythematous margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" />{{rp|52}}

==Treatment==
Treatment is cause related, but also [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]] if the underlying cause is unknown or not correctable. It is also important to note that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from simply smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma, to addressing underlying factors such as dry mouth or substituting a problem medication. Maintaining good [[oral hygiene]] and use of an [[antiseptic]] mouthwashes/sprays (e.g. [[chlorhexidine]]) can prevent secondary infection and therefore hasten healing. A topical analgesic (e.g. [[benzydamine]] mouthwash) may reduce pain. Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. An [[antifungal medication|antifungal]] drug may be used to prevent [[oral candidiasis]] developing in those who use prolonged steroids.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain.<ref name=MedlinePlus /> Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" />{{rp|53}}

==Epidemiology==
Oral ulceration is a common cause for people to seek medical or dental advice.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" />{{rp|52}} A breach of the oral mucosa probably affects most people at various times during life.
