The '''superficial branch of the [[radial nerve]]'''  passes along the front of the radial side of the [[forearm]] to the commencement of its lower third. 

It lies at first slightly lateral to the radial artery, concealed beneath the [[Brachioradialis]]. In the middle third of the forearm, it lies behind the same muscle, close to the lateral side of the artery. 

It quits the artery about 7 cm. above the wrist, passes beneath the tendon of the Brachioradialis, and, piercing the deep fascia, divides into two branches: lateral and medial.

==Lateral branch==
The ''lateral branch'', the smaller, supplies the radial side of the thumb (by a digital nerve), the skin of the radial side and ball of the thumb, joining with the volar branch of the [[Lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm|lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve]].

==Medial branch==
The ''medial branch'' communicates, above the wrist, with the dorsal branch of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous, and, on the back of the hand, with the dorsal branch of the [[ulnar nerve]]. 

It then divides into four digital nerves, which are distributed as follows: the first supplies the ulnar side of the thumb; the second, the radial side of the [[index finger]]; the third, the adjoining sides of the index and middle fingers; the fourth communicates with a filament from the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve, and supplies the adjacent sides of the middle and ring fingers.
