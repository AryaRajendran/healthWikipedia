'''AA amyloidosis''' is a form of [[amyloidosis]], i.e. a disease characterized by the abnormal deposition of fibers of insoluble protein in the extracellular space of various tissues and organs. In AA amyloidosis, the deposited protein is [[serum amyloid A protein]] (SAA), an [[acute-phase protein]] which is normally soluble and whose plasma concentration is highest during [[inflammation]].<ref name="pmid17554117">{{cite journal |author=Lachmann HJ, Goodman HJ, Gilbertson JA, ''et al.'' |title=Natural history and outcome in systemic AA amyloidosis |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=356 |issue=23 |pages=2361â€“71 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17554117 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa070265 |url=http://rushrenalorientation.com/www.rushrenalorientation.com/Reading_List_files/Amyloidosis%20AA%20NEJM%2007_1.pdf}}</ref> AA amyloidosis is therefore a complication of a number of inflammatory diseases and infections, such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[bronchiectasis]], chronic [[osteomyelitis]], and the inheritable condition called [[familial Mediterranean fever]].<ref name=Kumar5>Chapter 5 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref> It can also be caused by [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[renal cell carcinoma]].

The SAA protein is mainly deposited in the liver, spleen and kidney, and AA amyloidosis can lead to [[nephrotic syndrome]].<ref name=>{{cite web|title=AA (Inflammatory) Amyloidosis |work=Medscape Reference|date=|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/335559-overview}}</ref><ref name="urlBU">{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/amyloid/resources/physician-resources/clinical-aa/ |title=AA Amyloidosis |work= BU Amyloid Treatment & Research Program|accessdate=}}</ref>

==Current Clinical Research==
[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01215747?term=aa+amyloidosis&rank=1 Kiacta - (eprodisate disodium)] is currently being evaluated as a protector of renal function in AA amyloidosis.
