'''Pendred syndrome''' or '''Pendred disease''' is a [[genetic disorder]] leading to congenital bilateral (both sides) [[sensorineural hearing loss]] and [[goitre]] with occasional [[hypothyroidism]] (decreased [[thyroid|thyroid gland]] function). There is no specific treatment, other than supportive measures for the hearing loss and [[thyroid hormone]] supplementation in case of hypothyroidism. It is named after Dr Vaughan Pendred (1869–1946), the [[England|English]] doctor who first described the condition in an [[Ireland|Irish]] family living in [[Durham]] in 1896.<ref name=Pendred>{{cite journal | author=Pendred V | title=Deaf-mutism and goitre | journal=Lancet | year=1896 |volume=2 | issue=3808 | pages=532 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)74403-0}}</ref><ref name=Pearce>{{cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Pendred's syndrome |journal=Eur.

==Signs and symptoms==
The hearing loss of Pendred's syndrome is often, although not always, present from birth, and language acquisition may be a significant problem if deafness is severe in childhood. The hearing loss typically worsens over the years, and progression can be step-wise and related to minor head trauma. In some cases, language development worsens after [[head injury]], demonstrating that the inner ear is sensitive to trauma in Pendred syndrome; this is as a consequence of the widened vestibular aqueducts usual in this syndrome.<ref name=Reardon>{{cite journal |author=Reardon W, Coffey R, Phelps PD, ''et al.'' |title=Pendred syndrome--100 years of underascertainment? |journal=QJM |volume=90 |issue=7 |pages=443–7 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9302427 |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/90/7/443 | format=PDF |doi=10.1093/qjmed/90.7.443}}</ref> Vestibular function varies in Pendred syndrome and vertigo can be a feature of minor head trauma. A goitre is present in 75% of all cases.<ref name=Reardon/>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Audiometry]] (measuring ability to hear sounds of a particular pitch) is usually abnormal, but the findings are not particularly specific and an audiogram is not sufficient to diagnose Pendred's syndrome. A thyroid goitre may be present in the first decade and is usual towards the end of the second decade. [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scanning]] of the inner ear usually shows widened or large vestibular aqueducts with enlarged endolymphatic sacs and may show abnormalities of the cochleae known as [[Mondini dysplasia]].<ref name=Reardon/> Genetic testing to identify the Pendrin gene usually establishes the diagnosis. If the condition is suspected, a "perchlorate discharge test" is sometimes performed. This test is highly [[sensitivity (test)|sensitive]], but may also be abnormal in other thyroid conditions.<ref name=Reardon/> If a goitre is present, [[thyroid function tests]] are performed to identify mild cases of thyroid dysfunction even if they are not yet causing symptoms.<ref name=NIDCD>{{cite web |author=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders | url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pendred.asp |title=Pendred Syndrome |date = October 2006|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>

==Genetics==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Pendred syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Pendred syndrome inherits in an [[autosomal recessive]] manner, meaning that one would need to inherit an abnormal gene from each parent to develop the condition. This also means that a sibling of a patient with Pendred's syndrome has a 25% chance of also having the condition.

It has been linked to [[mutation]]s in the ''PDS'' [[gene]], which codes for the ''[[pendrin]]'' protein (solute carrier family 26, member 4, [[SLC26A4]]). The gene is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 7 (human)|chromosome 7]] (7q31).<ref name=Sheffield>{{cite journal |author=Sheffield VC, Kraiem Z, Beck JC, ''et al.'' |title=Pendred syndrome maps to chromosome 7q21-34 and is caused by an intrinsic defect in thyroid iodine organification |journal=Nat.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

SLC26A4 can be found in the [[cochlea]] (part of the inner ear), [[thyroid]] and the [[kidney]]. In the kidney, it participates in the secretion of [[bicarbonate]]. However, Pendred's syndrome is not known to lead to kidney problems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Royaux IE, Wall SM, Karniski LP, ''et al.'' |title=Pendrin, encoded by the Pendred syndrome gene, resides in the apical region of renal intercalated cells and mediates bicarbonate secretion |journal=Proc.

==Treatment==
No specific treatment exists for Pendred syndrome. [[Speech and language pathology|Speech and language support]], and [[cochlear implant]]s, may improve language skills.<ref name=NIDCD/> If thyroid hormone levels are decreased, [[thyroxine]] may be required. Patients are advised to take precautions against head injury.<ref name=NIDCD/>
