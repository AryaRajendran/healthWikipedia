The '''macula''' or '''macula lutea''' (from [[Latin]] ''macula'', "spot" + ''lutea'', "yellow") is an oval-shaped highly pigmented [[yellow]] spot near the center of the [[retina]] of the [[human eye]]. It has a diameter of around 1.5&nbsp;mm and is often [[histologically]] defined as having two or more layers of [[ganglion cell]]s. Near its center is the [[fovea]], a small pit that contains the largest concentration of [[cone cell]]s in the eye and is responsible for central, high resolution vision.  The macula also contains the [[parafovea]] and [[perifovea]].

Because the macula is yellow in color it absorbs excess blue and ultraviolet light that enter the eye, and acts as a natural sunblock (analogous to sunglasses) for this area of the retina. The yellow colour comes from its content of [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]], which are yellow [[xanthophyll]] [[carotenoid]]s, derived from the diet. Zeaxanthin predominates at the macula, while lutein predominates elsewhere in the retina. There is some evidence that these carotenoids protect the pigmented region from some types of [[macular degeneration]].

Structures in the macula are specialized for high [[Visual acuity|acuity]] vision. Within the macula are the [[fovea]] and [[foveola]] which contain a high density of [[Cone cell|cones]] (photoreceptors with high acuity).

==Clinical significance==
Whereas loss of [[peripheral vision]] may go unnoticed for some time, damage to the macula will result in loss of central vision, which is usually immediately obvious.
The progressive destruction of the macula is a [[disease]] known as [[macular degeneration]] and can sometimes lead to the creation of a macular hole. Macular holes are rarely caused by trauma, but if a severe blow is delivered it can burst the blood vessels going to the macula, destroying it.

Visual input from the macula occupies a substantial portion of the brain's visual capacity.  As a result, some forms of [[Visual field#Visual field loss|visual field loss]] can occur without involving the macula; this is termed '''macular sparing'''.  (For example, [[visual field testing]] might demonstrate ''[[homonymous hemianopia]] with macular sparing''.)

In the case of Occipitoparital ischemia owing to occlusion of elements of either [[posterior cerebral artery]], patients may display cortical [[blindness]] (which involves blindness that the patient denies having, as seen in [[Anton-Babinski syndrome|Anton's Syndrome]]), yet display sparing of the macula. This selective sparing is due to the collateral circulation offered to macular tracts by the [[middle cerebral artery]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Helseth,|first=Erek|title=Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1160677-overview#aw2aab6b2|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> Neurological examination that confirms macular sparing can go far in representing the type of damage mediated by an infarct, in this case, indicating that the caudal visual cortex (which is the principal recipient of macular projections of the optic nerve) has been spared. Further, it indicates that cortical damage rostral to, and including, [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] is an unlikely outcome of the infarction, as too much of the lateral geniculate nucleus is, proportionally, devoted to macular-stream processing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Siegel|first=Allan|title=Essential Neuroscience|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=978-0-7813-9121-2{{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}|edition=First Revised|coauthors=Sapru, Hreday N.|editor=Betty Sun}}</ref>
