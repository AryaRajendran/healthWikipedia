'''Bilevel positive airway pressure''' ('''BPAP''') is a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [[Modes of mechanical ventilation|mode]] used during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. It delivers a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP).  B<sub>PAP</sub> can be described as a continuous positive airway pressure system with a time-cycled or flow-cycled change of the applied CPAP level.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = C. Hormann, M.

== Use ==
Bilevel positive airway pressure is used when positive airway pressure is needed with the addition of pressure support.  Common situations where positive airway pressure is indicated are those where taking a breath is difficult.  These include [[pneumonia]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]] and [[status asthmaticus]].<ref name="pmid21567114">{{cite journal| author=Williams AM, Abramo TJ, Shah MV, Miller RA, Burney-Jones C, Rooks S et al.| title=Safety and clinical findings of BiPAP utilization in children 20 kg or less for asthma exacerbations. | journal=Intensive Care Med | year= 2011 | volume= 37 | issue= 8 | pages= 1338–43 | pmid=21567114 | doi=10.1007/s00134-011-2238-9 | pmc= | url= }} </ref><ref name="pmid17157675">{{cite journal| author=Beers SL, Abramo TJ, Bracken A, Wiebe RA| title=Bilevel positive airway pressure in the treatment of status asthmaticus in pediatrics. | journal=Am J Emerg Med | year= 2007 | volume= 25 | issue= 1 | pages= 6–9 | pmid=17157675 | doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2006.07.001 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=17157675  }} </ref>

==Discouraged terminology==
Often BPAP is incorrectly referred to as "BiPAP". {{refnec|BiPAP®  is the name of a portable ventilator manufactured by [[Respironics Corporation]] and is just one of many ventilators that can deliver BPAP|date=March 2013}}.

==Settings and measurements==
*'''IPAP''': this is the pressure applied during patient triggered breaths.
*'''EPAP''': this is the pressure applied in between patient triggered breaths. It could also be considered a continuous positive pressure.
*'''''Fi''O<sub>2</sub>''': The [[FiO2|fraction of O<sub>2</sub> percentage]] that is being added to the delivered air.
*'''V<sub>f</sub>''': on many machines a respiratory rate it set as a guarantee for intermittent bursts of IPAP.

==History==
Biphasic/bilevel as a mode of ventilation was first presented in 1988 by Professor Benzer of Innsbruck and his group. His theory consisted of alternating [[PEEP]] levels.<ref>Benzer H (1988) Ventilatory support by intermittent changes in PEEP levels. 4th European Congress on Intensive Care Medicine. Baveno-Stresa</ref> This was the first time the acronym BIPAP was used and was followed in 1989 with the publication of a new approach to ventilatory technique<ref>Baum M, Benzer H, Putensen CH, Koller W. & Putz G (1989) – eine neue Form der augmentierenden Beatmung. Anaesthetist 38:452-458</ref> by Baum & Benzer which was also the first full year of commercial introduction of "Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure" as an integrated mode of ventilation on the Evita ventilator.  This concept was introduced as a positive adjunct to weaning from ventilator support.
