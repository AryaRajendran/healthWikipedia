'''''Anisakis''''' is a [[genus]] of [[parasitic]] [[nematode]]s, which have life cycles involving [[fish]] and [[marine mammal]]s.<ref>Berger SA, Marr JS. Human Parasitic Diseases Sourcebook. Jones and Bartlett Publishers: Sudbury, Massachusetts, 2006.</ref>  They are infective to humans and cause [[#Anisakiasis|anisakiasis]].  People who produce [[immunoglobulin E]] in response to this parasite may subsequently have an allergic reaction, including [[anaphylactic|anaphylaxis]], after eating fish that have been infected with ''Anisakis'' species.

==Life cycle==
[[File:Anisakiasis 01.png|thumb|left|Complex life cycle of ''Anisakis'' worms]]
''Anisakis'' species have complex [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s which pass through a number of hosts through the course of their lives. Eggs hatch in seawater, and [[larva]]e are eaten by crustaceans, usually [[Krill|euphausids]]. The infected crustacean is subsequently eaten by a fish or squid, and the nematode burrows into the wall of the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] and [[cyst|encysts]] in a protective coat, usually on the outside of the [[viscera]]l organs, but occasionally in the [[muscle]] or beneath the [[skin]]. The life cycle is completed when an infected fish is eaten by a marine mammal, such as a [[whale]], [[Pinniped|seal]], or [[dolphin]]. The nematode excysts in the intestine, feeds, grows, mates and releases eggs into the seawater in the host's [[feces]]. As the gut of a marine mammal is functionally very similar to that of a human, ''Anisakis'' species are able to infect humans who eat raw or undercooked fish.

The known [[biodiversity|diversity]] of the genus has increased greatly over the past 20 years, with the advent of modern [[gene]]tic techniques in [[scientific classification|species identification]]. Each final host species was discovered to have its own biochemically and genetically identifiable "sibling species" of ''Anisakis'', which is reproductively isolated. This finding has allowed the proportion of different sibling species in a fish to be used as an indicator of [[population]] identity in fish stocks.

==Morphology==
[[File:So4b-08.jpg|thumb|right|A scanning electron micrograph of the mouthparts of ''A. simplex'']]
Anisakids share the common features of all nematodes; the [[wikt:vermiform|vermiform]] body plan, round in [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] and a lack of [[segmentation (biology)|segmentation]]. The body cavity is reduced to a narrow [[body cavity|pseudocoel]]. The [[Mouth (animal)|mouth]] is located [[anterior]]ly, and surrounded by projections used in feeding and sensation, with the [[anus]] slightly offset from the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]]. The [[squamous epithelium]] secretes a layered [[cuticle]] to protect the body from digestive juices.

As with all parasites with a complex life cycle involving a number of hosts, details of the morphology vary depending on the host and life cycle stage. In the stage which infects fish, ''Anisakis'' species are found in a distinctive "watch-spring coil" shape. They are roughly 2&nbsp;cm long when uncoiled. When in the final host, anisakids are longer, thicker and more sturdy, to deal with the hazardous environment of a mammalian gut.

==Health implications==
Anisakids pose a risk to human health through intestinal infection with worms from the eating of underprocessed fish, and through allergic reactions to chemicals left by the worms in fish flesh.<ref name="pmid17823758">{{cite journal |author=Amato Neto V, Amato JG, Amato VS |title=Probable recognition of human anisakiasis in Brazil |journal=Rev.

Anisakiasis is a human parasitic infection of the gastrointestinal tract caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood containing larvae of the nematode ''Anisakis simplex''.  The first case of human infection by a member of the family Anisakidae was reported in the Netherlands by Van Thiel, who described the presence of a marine nematode in a patient suffering from acute abdominal pain. <ref name=Audicana> {{cite journal

}}</ref> It is frequently reported in areas of the world where fish is consumed raw, lightly pickled or salted.  The areas of highest prevalence are [[Scandinavia]] (from [[cod]] [[livers]]), [[Japan]] (after eating [[sushi]] and [[sashimi]]), the [[Netherlands]] (by eating infected [[Soused herring|fermented herrings]] (''maatjes'')), and along the [[Pacific]] coast of [[South America]] (from eating ''[[ceviche]]''). Fewer than ten cases occur annually in the United States.<ref name=FDA>[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070768.htm] ''Bad Bug Book: Foodborne Pathogens Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook.'' Food and Drug Administration.</ref>  Development of better diagnostic tools and greater awareness has led to more frequent reporting of anisakiasis. 

Within hours after ingestion of infective larvae, violent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may occur.  Occasionally, the larvae are regurgitated.  If the larvae pass into the bowel, a severe [[eosinophilic]] [[granulomatous]] response may also occur one to two weeks following infection, causing symptoms mimicking [[Crohn's disease]].

Diagnosis can be made by gastroscopic examination, during which the 2-cm larvae are visually observed and removed, or by histopathologic examination of tissue removed at biopsy or during surgery.

Raising consumer and producer awareness about the existence of anisakid worms in fish is a critical and effective prevention strategy. Anisakiasis can be easily prevented by adequate cooking at temperatures greater than 60°C or freezing. The FDA recommends all shellfish and fish intended for raw consumption be blast frozen to -35°C or below for 15 hours or be regularly frozen to -20°C or below for seven days. <ref name=FDA/> Salting and marinating will not necessarily kill the parasites. Humans are thought to be more at risk of anisakiasis from eating wild fish than farmed fish. Many countries require all types of fish with potential risk intended for raw consumption to be previously frozen to kill parasites. The mandate to freeze herring in the Netherlands has virtually eliminated human anisakiasis. <ref name="John>{{cite book

===Allergic reactions===
Even when thoroughly cooked, ''Anisakis'' larvae pose a health risk to humans. Anisakids (and related species such as the sealworm, ''Pseudoterranova'' species, and the codworm ''Hysterothylacium aduncum'') release a number of [[biochemical]]s into the surrounding tissues when they infect a fish. They are also often consumed whole, accidentally, inside a fillet of fish.

[[File:Anisakids.jpg|thumb|right|Anisakid larvae in the body cavity of a [[herring]] ''(Clupea harengus)'']]

Acute allergic manifestations, such as [[urticaria]] and [[anaphylaxis]], may occur with or without accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms. The frequency of allergic symptoms in connection with fish ingestion has led to the concept of gastroallergic anisakiasis, an acute IgE-mediated generalized reaction. <ref name=Audicana/> Occupational allergy, including asthma, conjunctivitis, and contact dermatitis, has been observed in fish processing workers. <ref name=Nieuwenhuizen> {{cite journal

Sensitivization and allergy are determined by skin-prick test and detection of specific antibodies against ''Anisakis''. Hypersensitivity is indicated by a rapid rise in levels of [[immunoglobulin E|IgE]] in the first several days following consumption of infected fish. <ref name=Audicana/>

==Treatment==
For the worm, humans are a dead-end host.  ''Anisakis'' and ''Pseudoterranova'' larvae cannot survive in humans, and will eventually die. In some cases, the infection will resolve with only symptomatic treatment.<ref name="pmid19336962">{{cite journal |author=Nakaji K |title=Enteric anisakiasis which improved with conservative treatment |journal=Intern.

==Occurrence==
Larval anisakids are common parasites of marine and anadromous fish (e.g. [[salmon]], [[sardine]]), and can also be found in squid and cuttlefish. In contrast, they are absent from fish in waters of low salinity, due to the physiological requirements of [[euphausiids]], which are needed to complete their life cycle.
Anisakids are also uncommon in areas where cetaceans are rare, such as the southern [[North Sea]].<ref>{{cite journal
