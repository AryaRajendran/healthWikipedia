In 1982, some small-scale clinical investigations of lovastatin, a polyketide-derived natural product isolated from ''Aspergillus terreus'', in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, with very few adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought to be associated with compactin, clinical studies continued.

Large-scale trials confirmed the effectiveness of lovastatin. Observed tolerability continued to be excellent, and lovastatin was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in 1987.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=019643&TABLE1=OB_Rx FDA Orange Book Detail for application N019643 showing approval for 20 mg tablets on Aug 31, 1987 and 40 mg tablets on Dec 14, 1988]</ref> It was the first statin approved by the FDA.<ref>{{cite journal|first= Akira|last= Endo|title= The origin of the statins |journal= Atheroscler Suppl. |year= 2004|month= Oct|volume= 5|issue= 3|pages= 125–30|pmid= 15531285|doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosissup.2004.08.033 }}</ref> 

Lovastatin at its maximal recommended dose of 80&nbsp;mg daily produced a mean reduction in LDL cholesterol of 40%, a far greater reduction than could be obtained with any of the treatments available at the time. Equally important, the drug produced very few adverse effects and was easy for patients to take, so was rapidly accepted by prescribers and patients. The most significant adverse effect is [[rhabdomyolysis]]; this is rare and may occur with the use of any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.

In 1998, the FDA placed a ban on the sale of dietary supplements derived from [[red yeast rice]], which naturally contains lovastatin, arguing that products containing prescription agents require drug approval.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  This ban was subsequently rescinded, in light of law that upholds that natural products are not patentable.

==Mechanism of action==
Lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.<!--
  --><ref name="Alberts98">{{cite journal | author = Alberts AW | title = Discovery, biochemistry and biology of lovastatin | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 62 | pages = 10J–15J | year = 1998| doi = 10.1016/0002-9149(88)90002-1 | pmid = 3055919 | issue = 15}}</ref>
Mevalonate is a required building block for cholesterol biosynthesis and lovastatin interferes with its production by acting as a reversible competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA, which binds to the HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin, being inactive in the native form, the form in which it is administered, is hydrolysed to the β-hydroxy acid form in the body; this is the active form.

==Discovery, biochemistry and biology==
[[Image:Lovastatin2.png|180px|thumb|right|A ball-and-stick model of lovastatin]]

An elevated concentration of plasma cholesterol, especially [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally accepted as a major risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007115.htm Coronary heart disease: MedLine Plus Medical Encyclopedia]</ref> The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the [[isoprene]]s that are building-blocks of [[squalene]], the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.<ref name="Alberts98"/>

HMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring.

Lovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Endo]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of [[mevastatin]], a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of ''Penicillium citrium''.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Akira|last=Endo|coauthors=Kuroda M., Tsujita Y.|title=ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium|journal=Journal of Antibiotics (Tokyo)|year=1976|month=December|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1346–8|pmid=1010803|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.29.1346}}</ref>  Mevastatin was demonstrated to be an unusually potent inhibitor of the target enzyme and of cholesterol biosynthesis. Subsequent to the first reports describing mevastatin, efforts were initiated to search for other naturally occurring inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase. This led to the discovery of a novel fungal metabolite – lovastatin. The structure of lovastatin was determined to be different from that of mevastatin by the presence of a six alphamethyl group in the hexahydronaphthalene ring.

Key points from the study of the biosynthesis of lovastatin:

* Lovastatin is composed of two polyketide chains derived from acetate, two and four carbons long, coupled in head-to-tail fashion.
* The six alphamethyl group and the methyl group on the four-carbon side-chain are derived from the methyl group of methionine.
* The six alphamethyl group is added before closure of the rings.

This implies that lovastatin is a unique compound synthesized by ''A. terreus'' and that mevastatin is not an intermediate in its formation.

===Biosynthesis using Diels-Alder catalyzed cyclization===

''In vitro'' formation of a triketide lactone using a genetically modified protein derived from 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been demonstrated. Witter and Vederas observed, "the stereochemistry of the molecule supports the intriguing idea that an enzyme-catalyzed [[Diels-Alder]] reaction may occur during assembly of the polyketide chain. It, thus, appears that biological Diels-Alder reactions may be triggered by generation of reactive triene systems on an enzyme surface."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Witter | first =DJ | coauthors = Vederas, JC |title=Putative Diels-Alder catalyzed cyclization during the biosynthesis of lovastatin |journal=[[J Org Chem]] |volume=61 |issue=8|pages=2613–23|year=1996 |doi=10.1021/jo952117p |pmid = 11667090}}</ref>

===Total synthesis===
A major bulk of work in the synthesis of lovastatin was done by M. Hirama in the 1980s.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Hirama M, Vet M | title = A chiral total synthesis of compactin | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 104 | page = 4251| year = 1982| doi = 10.1021/ja00379a037 | issue = 15}}</ref>

Hirama synthesized compactin and used one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence is shown in the schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in [[methanol]] and then [[silylation]] to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the [[silyl ether]]. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with [[Acetic anhydride|Ac<sub>2</sub>O]] and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in [[chlorobenzene]] for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.

Simple organic reactions were used to get to lovastatin as shown in the scheme.

==Pharmacology and dose==
{{Main|statin}}
The mode of action of statins is [[HMG-CoA reductase]] enzyme inhibition.  This enzyme is needed by the body to make cholesterol.

Lovastatin causes cholesterol to be lost from LDL, but also reduces the concentration of circulating LDL particles.  Apolipoprotein B concentration falls substantially during treatment with lovastatin.  Lovastatin's ability to lower LDL is thought to be due to a reduction in VLDL, which is a precursor to LDL.  Also, lovastatin may increase the number of LDL receptors on the surface of cell membranes, and thus increase the breakdown of LDL.

Lovastatin can also produce slight to moderate increases in HDL, and slight to moderate decreases in [[triglycerides]].  Both of these effects are typically beneficial to a patient with a poor lipid profile.

Both lovastatin and its b-hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound (>95%) to human plasma proteins. Animal studies demonstrated that lovastatin crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite web | title=Lovastatin | url=http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/lovastat.htm | publisher=Rxlist.com}}</ref>
Elderly patients, or those with [[renal]] insufficiency, may have higher plasma concentrations of lovastatin after administration and may require a lower dose.  The usual recommended starting dose is 20&nbsp;mg once a day given with the evening meal, and the dose range is 10–80&nbsp;mg a day in a single dose, or divided into two doses.

Lovastatin and other statins have recently been studied for their [[chemopreventive]] and [[chemotherapeutic]] effects in certain cancers. However, based on clinical evidence, such effects could not be demonstrated.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = MS | title = Therapy insight: Potential of statins for cancer chemoprevention and therapy | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16264880 | journal = Nature clinical practice.

For that purpose, lovastatin is also used experimentally.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rao S, Porter DC, Chen X, Herliczek T, Lowe M, Keyomarsi K |title=Lovastatin-mediated G1 arrest is through inhibition of the proteasome, independent of hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase |journal=Proc.

==Side effects and contraindications==
Lovastatin is usually well tolerated. As with all statin drugs, it can rarely cause [[myopathy]] or [[rhabdomyolysis]]. This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor.

Components of grapefruit juice, the [[flavonoid]] [[naringin]], or the [[furanocoumarin]] [[bergamottin]] inhibit CYP3A4 ''in vitro'',<ref>David G. Bailey, J. Malcolm, O. Arnold, J. David Spence (1998). "Grapefruit juice-drug interactions". Br J Clin Pharmacol 46 (2): 101–110. doi:10.1046/j.1365-2125.1998.00764.x. PMC 1873672. PMID 9723817.</ref> and may account for the ''in vivo'' effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of lovastatin, and increasing its plasma concentrations.<ref>Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1998 Apr;63(4):397-402. Grapefruit juice greatly increases serum concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid. Kantola T, Kivistö KT, Neuvonen PJ. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9585793</ref>

Lovastatin at doses higher than 20&nbsp;mg per day should not be used in conjunction with [[gemfibrozil]] (Lopid) or other [[fibrate]]s, [[niacin]], or [[cyclosporine]], because of the significantly increased  risk of [[rhabdomyolysis]]. Additional drugs that should not be taken alongside lovastatin include, but are not limited to: [[cholestyramine]] (Questran), [[colestipol]] (Colestid), and [[danazol]] (Danocrine).<ref name="Rxlist">{{cite web|last=Stöppler|first=Melissa|title=Mevacor Side Effects Center|url=http://www.rxlist.com/mevacor-side-effects-drug-center.htm|publisher=RxList|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>

==Pharmacopoeia information==
Lovastatin tablets are preserved when stored in well-closed, light-resistant containers in a cool place or at controlled room temperature.

Lovastatin tablets are tested for dissolution and assay as per the USP.

Limit for dissolution – Not less than 80% (Q) of the labeled amount of lovastatin is dissolved in 30 minutes.

Limit for assay – Each tablet contains not less than 90% and not more than 110% of the labeled amount of lovastatin, tested by HPLC analysis.

==Other applications==
In plant physiology, lovastatin has occasionally been used as inhibitor of [[cytokinin]] biosynthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=     Hartig K, Beck E|title=         Assessment of lovastatin application as tool in probing cytokinin-mediated cell cycle regulation|journal=     Physiologia Plantarum|year=2005|volume=125|issue=2|pages=260–267 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2005.00556.x}}</ref>

Lovastatin is currently in phase one of clinical trial (NCT00352599) to evaluate safety for treatment of cognitive deficits in patients with [[neurofibromatosis type I]].  This drug has been shown to reverse spatial deficits in [[mice]].<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00352599?term=NCT00352599&rank=1 "Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Lovastatin in Individuals With Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1)" ]</ref>
