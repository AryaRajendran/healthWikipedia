'''Post-traumatic seizures''' ('''PTS''') are [[seizure]]s that result from [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), [[brain damage]] caused by [[physical trauma]]. PTS may be a risk factor for [[post-traumatic epilepsy]] (PTE), but a person who has a seizure or seizures due to traumatic brain injury does not necessarily have PTE, which is a form of [[epilepsy]], a chronic condition in which seizures occur repeatedly. However, "PTS" and "PTE" may be used interchangeably in medical literature.<ref name=Silver05/>

Seizures are usually an indication of a more severe TBI.<ref name=Silver05/>  Seizures that occur shortly after a person suffers a brain injury may further damage the already vulnerable brain.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> They may reduce the amount of oxygen available to the brain,<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> cause excitatory [[neurotransmitter]]s to be released in excess, increase the brain's [[metabolism|metabolic]] need, and raise the [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the intracranial space]], further contributing to damage.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> Thus, people who suffer severe head trauma are given [[anticonvulsant]] medications as a precaution against seizures.<ref name="IudiceMurri"/> 

Around 5–7% of people hospitalized with TBI have at least one seizure.<ref name="TeasellBayona"/>  PTS are more likely to occur in more severe injuries, and certain types of injuries increase the risk further.  The risk that a person will suffer PTS becomes progressively lower as time passes after the injury.  However, TBI survivors may still be at risk over 15&nbsp;years after the injury.<ref name="Frey03"/>  Children and older adults are at a higher risk for PTS.

==Classification==
In the mid 1970s, PTS was first classified by [[Bryan Jennett]] into '''early''' and '''late seizures''', those occurring within the first week of injury and those occurring after a week, respectively.<ref name="SwashM98">

</ref> Though the seven day cutoff for early seizures is used widely, it is arbitrary; seizures occurring after the first week but within the first month of injury may share characteristics with early seizures.<ref name="Chang03"/>  Some studies use a 30&nbsp;day cutoff for early seizures instead.<ref name="Garga06">

</ref> Later it became accepted to further divide seizures into '''immediate PTS''',  seizures occurring within 24 hours of injury; early PTS, with seizures between a day and a week after trauma; and late PTS, seizures more than one week after trauma.<ref name=Cuccurullo/>  Some consider late PTS to be synonymous with [[post-traumatic epilepsy]].<ref name="Benardo03">

Immediate and early seizures are thought to be a direct reaction to the injury, while late seizures are believed to result from damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] by mechanisms such as [[excitotoxicity]] and iron from blood.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> Immediate seizures occurring within two seconds of injury probably occur because the force from the injury stimulates brain tissue that has a low threshold for seizures when stimulated.<ref name="Maria">

==Assessment and treatment==
Medical personnel aim to determine whether a seizure is caused by a change in the patient's biochemistry, such as [[hyponatremia]].<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> [[Neurological examination]]s and tests to measure levels of serum [[electrolyte]]s are performed.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>

[[Neuroimaging]] is used to guide treatment.  Often, [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is performed in any patient with PTS, but the less sensitive but more easily accessed [[CT scan]] may also be used.<ref name=PosnerLorenzo>Posner E, Lorenzo N (October 11, 2006).

Seizures that result from TBI are often difficult to treat.<ref name="Herman02"/> Antiepileptic drugs that may be given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] shortly after injury include phenytoin, [[sodium valproate]], [[carbamazepine]], and phenobarbital.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>  Antiepileptic drugs do not prevent all seizures in all people,<ref name="Frey03"/> but phenytoin and sodium valproate usually stop seizures that are in progress.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>

==Prognosis==
PTS is associated with a generally good prognosis.<ref name="Maria"/> It is unknown exactly how long after a TBI a person is at higher risk for seizures than the rest of the population, but estimates have suggested lengths of 10 to over 15&nbsp;years.<ref name="Frey03"/> For most people with TBI, seizures do not occur after three months, and only 20–25% of people who suffer TBI have PTS more than two years after the injury.<ref name=Cuccurullo/>  However, moderate and severe TBI still confer a high risk for PTS for up to five&nbsp;years after the injury.<ref name="TeasellBayona"/> 

Studies have reported that 25–40% of PTS patients go into [[Remission (medicine)|remission]]; later studies conducted after the development of more effective seizure medications reported higher overall remission rates.<ref name="Frey03"/> In one quarter of people with seizures from a head trauma, medication controls them well.<ref name=Silver05>

}} 
</ref> and it is difficult to isolate PTS from severity of injury as a factor in PTE development.<ref name="Herman02"/> About 3% of patients with no early seizures develop late PTE; this number is 25% in those who do have early PTS, and the distinction is greater if other risk factors for developing PTE are excluded.<ref name=eepilepsy/>  Seizures that occur immediately after an insult are commonly believed not to confer an increased risk of recurring seizures, but evidence from at least one study has suggested that both immediate and early seizures may be risk factors for late seizures.<ref name="Frey03"/>  Early seizures may be less of a predictor for PTE in children; while as many as a third of adults with early seizures develop PTE, the portion of children with early PTS who have late seizures is less than one fifth in children and may be as low as one tenth.<ref name="Barrow92"/>  The incidence of late seizures is about half that in adults with comparable injuries.<ref name="Barrow92"/>

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:Pts bar graph by severity.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[relative risk]] of PTS increases with the severity of injury.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>]]

Research has found that the incidence of PTS varies widely based on the population studied; it may be as low as 4.4% or as high as 53%.<ref name="Frey03"/> Of all TBI patients who are hospitalized, 5 to 7% have PTS.<ref name="TeasellBayona"/> PTS occur in about 3.1% of traumatic brain injuries, but the severity of injury affects the likelihood of occurrence.<ref name=Cuccurullo/> 

The most important factor in whether a person will develop early and late seizures is the extent of the damage to the brain.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy">

</ref>  More severe brain injury also confers a risk for developing PTS for a longer time after the event.<ref name="TeasellBayona"/>  One study found that the probability that seizures will occur within 5&nbsp;years of injury is in 0.5% of [[mild traumatic brain injury|mild traumatic brain injuries]] (defined as no [[skull fracture]] and less than 30&nbsp;minutes of [[post-traumatic amnesia]], abbreviated PTA, or [[loss of consciousness]], abbreviated LOC); 1.2% of moderate injuries (skull fracture or PTA or LOC lasting between  30&nbsp;minutes and 24&nbsp;hours); and 10.0% of severe injuries (cerebral contusion, [[intracranial hematoma]], or LOC or PTA for over 24&nbsp;hours).<ref name="D'AmbrosioPerucca04">

}}
</ref> Another study found that the risk of seizures 5&nbsp;years after TBI is 1.5% in mild (defined as PTA or LOC for less than 30&nbsp;minutes), 2.9% in moderate (LOC lasting between 30&nbsp;minutes and 1&nbsp;day), and 17.2% in severe TBI (cerebral contusion, subdural hematoma, or LOC for over a day; image at right).<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/><ref name="GuptaWyllie06"/> 

Immediate seizures have an incidence of 1 to 4%, that of early seizures is 4 to 25%, and that of late seizures is 9 to 42%.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/>
 
Age influences the risk for PTS.  As age increases, risk of early and late seizures decreases; one study found that early PTS occurred in 30.8% of children age 7 or under, 20% of children between ages 8 and 16, and 8.4% of people who were over 16 at the time they were injured (graph at right).<ref name="Frey03"/><ref name="pmid10386527">

===Risk factors===
The chances that a person will suffer PTS are influenced by factors involving the injury and the person. The largest risks for PTS are having an altered level of consciousness for a protracted time after the injury, severe injuries with focal lesions, and fractures.<ref name="Garga06"/> The single largest risk for PTS is [[penetrating head trauma]], which carries a 35 to 50% risk of seizures within 15&nbsp;years.<ref name="AgrawalTimothy"/> If a fragment of metal remains in within the skull after injury, the risk of both early and late PTS may be increased.<ref name="Frey03"/>  Head trauma survivors who [[alcohol abuse|abused alcohol]] before the injury also at higher risk for developing seizures.<ref name="TeasellBayona"/> 

Occurrence of seizures varies widely even among people with similar injuries.<ref name="Frey03"/>  It is not known whether genetics play a role in PTS risk.<ref name="GuptaWyllie06"/>  Studies have had conflicting results with regard to the question of whether people with PTS are more likely to have family members with seizures, which would suggest a genetic role in PTS.<ref name="GuptaWyllie06"/> Most studies have found that epilepsy in family members does not significantly increase the risk of PTS.<ref name="Frey03"/> People with the [[ApoE-ε4]] allele may also be at higher risk for late PTS.<ref name=Silver05/>

Risks for late PTS include [[hydrocephalus]], reduced blood flow to the [[temporal lobe]]s of the brain,<ref name=Silver05/> [[brain contusion]]s, [[subdural hematoma]]s,<ref name="Frey03"/> a torn [[dura mater]], and  [[focal neurological deficit]]s.<ref name=Cuccurullo/> PTA that lasts for longer than 24&nbsp;hours after the injury is a risk factor for both early and late PTS.<ref name=Silver05/>  Up to 86% of people who have one late post-traumatic seizure have another within two years.<ref name="Frey03">
