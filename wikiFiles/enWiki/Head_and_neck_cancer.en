'''Head and neck cancer''' refers to a group of biologically similar cancers that start in the [[lip]], [[oral cavity]] (mouth), [[nasal cavity]] (inside the nose), [[paranasal sinuses]], [[Human pharynx|pharynx]], and [[larynx]]. 90% of head and neck cancers are [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s ('''SCCHN'''),<ref>http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Headneck/Aboutheadneckcancers/Typesofheadneckcancer.aspx</ref> originating from the [[mucosa]]l lining ([[epithelium]]) of these regions.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/templates/doc.aspx?viewid=7BDB0B90-2F6E-48A0-BCEA-00B2920A8933 NCI fact sheet on head and neck cancer]</ref> Head and neck cancers often spread to the [[lymph node]]s of the [[neck]], and this is often the first (and sometimes only) sign of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Head and neck cancer is strongly associated with certain environmental and lifestyle risk factors, including [[tobacco smoking]], [[alcohol]] consumption, [[UV light]], particular chemicals used in certain workplaces, and certain strains of [[virus]]es, such as [[human papillomavirus]].<ref name=ridge/> These cancers are frequently aggressive in their biologic behavior; patients with these types of cancer are at a higher risk of developing another cancer in the head and neck area.<ref name=ridge>Ridge JA, Glisson BS, Lango MN, et al. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter04/article/10165/1402663 "Head and Neck Tumors"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> Head and neck cancer is highly curable if detected early, usually with some form of [[surgery]], but [[radiation therapy]] may also play an important role, while [[chemotherapy]] is often ineffective. The 2009 estimated number of head and neck cancer in the US is of 35,720 new cases.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/downloads/stt/CFF2009_EstCD_3.pdf Estimated New Cancer Cases and Deaths by Sex, US, 2009]</ref>

===Oral cavity===
{{Main|Oral cancer | Oropharyngeal cancer}}

Squamous cell cancers are common in the oral cavity, including the inner lip, [[tongue]], [[floor of mouth]], [[gingiva]]e, and [[hard palate]]. Cancers of the oral cavity are strongly associated with [[tobacco]] use, especially use of [[chewing tobacco]] or "dip", as well as heavy [[alcohol]] use. Cancers of this region, particularly the tongue, are more frequently treated with [[surgery]] than are other head and neck cancers.

Surgeries for oral cancers include
* Maxillectomy (can be done with or without [[orbital exenteration]])
* Mandibulectomy (removal of the mandible or lower jaw or part of it)
* [[Glossectomy]] (tongue removal, can be total, hemi or partial)
* Radical [[neck dissection]]
* [[Mohs surgery|Moh's procedure]]
* Combinational e.g., glossectomy and laryngectomy done together.

The defect is typically covered/improved by using another part of the body and/or skin grafts and/or wearing a [[prosthesis]].

===Nasopharynx===
[[Nasopharyngeal carcinoma|Nasopharyngeal cancer]] arises in the [[nasopharynx]], the region in which the [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]] and the [[Eustachian tube]]s connect with the upper part of the throat. While some nasopharyngeal cancers are biologically similar to the common HNSCC, "poorly differentiated" nasopharyngeal carcinoma is distinct in its [[epidemiology]], biology, clinical behavior, and treatment, and is treated as a separate disease by many experts.

===Oropharynx===
{{Main| Oropharyngeal cancer}}
Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) begins in the [[oropharynx]], the middle part of the throat that includes the [[soft palate]], the base of the [[tongue]], and the [[tonsil]]s. Squamous cell cancers of the tonsils are more strongly associated with [[human papillomavirus]] infection than are cancers of other regions of the head and neck.

===Hypopharynx===
The hypopharynx includes the pyriform sinuses, the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the postcricoid area. Tumors of the hypopharynx frequently have an advanced stage at diagnosis, and have the most adverse prognoses of pharyngeal tumors. They tend to [[metastasis|metastasize]] early due to the extensive lymphatic network around the [[larynx]].

===Larynx===
{{Main|Laryngeal cancer}}

Laryngeal cancer begins in the [[larynx]] or "voice box." Cancer may occur on the [[vocal folds]] themselves ("glottic" cancer), or on tissues above and below the true cords ("supraglottic" and "subglottic" cancers respectively). Laryngeal cancer is strongly associated with [[tobacco smoking]].

Surgery can include partial laryngectomy (removal of part of the larynx) and total laryngectomy (removal of the whole larynx). If the whole larynx has been removed the person is left with a permanent tracheostomy and can learn to speak again in a new way with the help of intensive teaching and speech therapy and/or an electronic device.

===Trachea===
Cancer of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] is a rare malignancy which can be biologically similar in many ways to head and neck cancer, and is sometimes classified as such.

Most tumors of the [[salivary glands]] differ from the common carcinomas of the head and neck in [[etiology]], [[histopathology]], clinical presentation, and therapy, Other uncommon tumors arising in the head and neck include [[teratoma]]s, [[adenocarcinomas]], [[adenoid cystic carcinoma]]s, and [[mucoepidermoid carcinoma]]s.<ref name=ridge/> Rarer still are [[melanomas]] and [[lymphomas]] of the upper aerodigestive tract.

==Signs and symptoms==
Throat cancer usually begins with symptoms that seem harmless enough, like an enlarged [[lymph node]] on the outside of the neck, a sore throat or a hoarse sounding voice. However, in the case of throat cancer, these conditions may persist and become chronic. There may be a lump or a sore in the throat or neck that does not heal or go away. There may be difficult or painful swallowing. Speaking may become difficult. There may be a persistent earache. Other possible but less common symptoms include some numbness or [[paralysis]] of the face muscles.

Presenting symptoms include
*[[Tumor|Mass]] in the neck
*Neck pain
*Bleeding from the mouth
*Sinus congestion, especially with [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]]
*Bad breath
*Sore tongue
*Painless ulcer or sores in the mouth that do not heal
*White, red or dark patches in the mouth that will not go away
*[[Otalgia|Earache]]
*Unusual bleeding or numbness in the mouth
*Lump in the lip, mouth or [[Gingiva|gums]]
*Enlarged [[Lymph node|lymph glands]] in the neck
*Slurring of speech (if the cancer is affecting the tongue)
*Hoarse voice which persists for more than six weeks
*Sore throat which persists for more than six weeks
*Difficulty swallowing food
*Change in diet or weight loss

==Causes==
[[ethanol|Alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] play a significant role.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Murata M, Takayama K, Choi B, Pak A |title=A nested case-control study on alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, and cancer |journal=Cancer Detect Prev |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=557–65 |year=1996 |pmid=8939341}}</ref> Alcohol and tobacco are likely [[synergistic]] in causing cancer of the head and neck.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Murata M, Takayama K, Choi B, Pak A |title=A nested case-control study on alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, and cancer |journal=Cancer Detect Prev |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=557–65 |year=1996 |pmid=8939341}}</ref>
Smokeless tobacco is an etiologic agent for oral and pharyngeal cancers (oropharyngeal cancer).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Winn D |title=Smokeless tobacco and aerodigestive tract cancers: recent research directions |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol |volume=320 |issue= |pages=39–46 |year= 1992|pmid=1442283|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-3468-6_6|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-0-306-44244-5}}</ref>
[[Cigar]] smoking is an important risk factor for oral cancers as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Iribarren C, Tekawa I, Sidney S, Friedman G |title=Effect of cigar smoking on the risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer in men |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=340 |issue=23 |pages=1773–80 |year=1999 |pmid=10362820 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402301}}</ref>
Other potential environmental [[carcinogens]] include occupational exposures such as [[nickel refining]], exposure to textile fibers, and woodworking. In one large, controlled study, [[marijuana]] use was not shown to be associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma.<ref>Rosenblatt KA. (2004). Marijuana use and risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer Res. 1;64(11):4049-54. PMID 15173020</ref> In another study, [[marijuana]] use was shown to be a potential protective factor against the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.<ref>Liang C. (2009). A population-based case-control study of marijuana use and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer Prev Res (Phila Pa). 2(8):759-68. PMID 19638490</ref> However, [[cigarette]] smokers have a lifetime increased risk for head and neck cancers that is 5- to 25-fold increased over the general population.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Andre K, Schraub S, Mercier M, Bontemps P |title=Role of alcohol and tobacco in the aetiology of head and neck cancer: a case-control study in the Doubs region of France |journal=Eur J Cancer B Oral Oncol |volume=31B |issue=5 |pages=301–9 |year=1995 |pmid=8704646 |doi=10.1016/0964-1955(95)00041-0}}</ref>
The ex-smoker's risk for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck begins to approach the risk in the general population twenty years after smoking cessation. The high prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use worldwide and the high association of these cancers with these substances makes them ideal targets for enhanced cancer prevention.

===Dietary causes===
Excessive consumption of processed meats and red meat were associated with increased rates of cancer of the head and neck in one study, while consumption of raw and cooked vegetables seemed to be protective.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Levi F, Pasche C, La Vecchia C, Lucchini F, Franceschi S, Monnier P |title=Food groups and risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer |journal=Int J Cancer |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=705–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9688303 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980831)77:5<705::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-Z}}</ref>

[[Vitamin E]] was not found to prevent the development of [[leukoplakia]], the white plaques that are the precursor for carcinomas of the mucosal surfaces, in adult smokers.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.1998.tb00261.x |author=Liede K, Hietanen J, Saxen L, Haukka J, Timonen T, Häyrinen-Immonen R, Heinonen O |title=Long-term supplementation with alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene and prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in smokers |journal=Oral Dis |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=78–83 |year=1998 |pmid=9680894}}</ref>
Another study examined a combination of Vitamin E and [[beta carotene]] in smokers with early-stage cancer of the oropharynx, and found a worse [[prognosis]] in the vitamin users.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bairati I, Meyer F, Gélinas M, Fortin A, Nabid A, Brochet F, Mercier J, Têtu B, Harel F, Mâsse B, Vigneault E, Vass S, del Vecchio P, Roy J |title=A randomized trial of antioxidant vitamins to prevent second primary cancers in head and neck cancer patients |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst |volume=97 |issue=7 |pages=481–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15812073 |doi=10.1093/jnci/dji095}}</ref>

===Betel nut===
[[Betel nut]] chewing is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jeng J, Chang M, Hahn L |title=Role of areca nut in betel quid-associated chemical carcinogenesis: current awareness and future perspectives |journal=Oral Oncol |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=477–92 |year=2001 |pmid=11435174 |doi=10.1016/S1368-8375(01)00003-3}}</ref>

===Human papillomavirus===
Recent evidence is accumulating pointing to a viral origin for some head and neck cancers.<ref name=AMN>{{Cite web| author = Everett E. Vokes | title =Head and Neck Cancer | work =Head and Neck Cancer | url=http://www.health.am/cr/head-and-neck-cancer/ | year = 2006 | month= June 28 | publisher=Armenian Health Network, Health.am | accessdate=2007-09-25}}</ref>

[[Human papillomavirus]] (HPV), in particular HPV16, is a causal factor for some head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).<ref>[http://www.la-press.com/redirect_file.php?fileId=1510&filename=CMENT-Moss-et-al&fileType=pdf Biomarkers for Cancers of the Head and Neck]</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17494927}}</ref> Approximately 15 to 25% of HNSCC contain genomic DNA from HPV,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-04-0551}}</ref> and the association varies based on the site of the tumor, especially [[HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer]], with highest distribution in the [[tonsils]], where
HPV DNA is found in (45 to 67%) of the cases,<ref>{{cite pmid|16644882}}</ref> less often in the hypopharynx (13%–25%), and least often in the oral cavity (12%–18%) and larynx (3%–7%).<ref>{{cite pmid|9028373}}</ref>

Some experts estimate that while up to 50% of cancers of the tonsil may be infected with HPV, only 50% of these are likely to be caused by HPV (as opposed to the usual [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] causes). The role of HPV in the remaining 25-30% is not yet clear.<ref>{{Cite journal| title = Molecular Classification Identifies a Subset of Human Papillomavirus-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancers With Favorable Prognosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.00.3335 | author = Weinberger, et al. | url = http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/JCO.2004.00.3335v1| pmid = 16401683| year = 2006| last2 = Yu| first2 = Z| last3 = Haffty| first3 = BG| last4 = Kowalski| first4 = D| last5 = Harigopal| first5 = M| last6 = Brandsma| first6 = J| last7 = Sasaki| first7 = C| last8 = Joe| first8 = J| last9 = Camp| first9 = RL| volume = 24| issue = 5| pages = 736–47}}</ref> Oral sex is not risk free and can result in HPV-related cancer.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Human Papillomavirus Infection and Oropharyngeal Cancer | author = Haddad, Robert I., MD | url = http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/facts/pdf/hpv_Infection.pdf |year = 2007}}</ref>

===Epstein-Barr virus===
[[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) infection is associated with [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma|nasopharyngeal cancer]].<ref name="AMN" /> Nasopharyngeal cancer occurs endemically in some countries of the Mediterranean and Asia, where EBV [[antibody]] [[titers]] can be measured to screen high-risk populations.<ref name="AMN" />
Nasopharyngeal cancer has also been associated with consumption of salted fish, which may contain high levels of [[nitrites]].

===Gastroesophageal reflux disease===
The presence of [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|acid reflux disease]] (GERD - gastroesphogeal reflux disease) or larynx reflux disease can also be a major factor. In the case of acid reflux disease, stomach acids flow up into the [[esophagus]] and damage its lining, making it more susceptible to throat cancer.

===Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation===
Patients after [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) are at a higher risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Post-HSCT oral cancer may have more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis, when compared to oral cancer in non-HSCT patients.<ref name="HSCT">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Zeevi I, ''et al.'' |title=Oral cancer in patients after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: long-term follow-up suggests an increased risk for recurrence |journal=Transplantation |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1243–4 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21119507 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f9caaa}}</ref> This effect is supposed to be owing to the continuous lifelong [[immune system|immune]] suppression and chronic oral [[graft-versus-host disease]].<ref name="HSCT" />

===Other possible causes===
There are a wide variety of factors which can put someone at a heightened risk for throat cancer. Such factors include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] or [[chewing tobacco|chewing]] [[tobacco]] or other things, such as [[gutkha]], or [[paan]], heavy [[alcohol]] consumption, poor diet resulting in [[vitamin]] deficiencies (worse if this is caused by heavy alcohol intake), weakened [[immune system]], [[asbestos]] exposure, prolonged exposure to wood dust or paint fumes, exposure to [[petroleum]] industry chemicals, and being over the age of 55 years. Another risk factor includes the appearance of white patches or spots in the mouth, known as [[leukoplakia]];<ref name=ridge/> in about ⅓ of the cases this develops into cancer.

==Diagnosis==

|footer=Left inferior internal jugular node metastases with extranodal invasion, two years after [[brachytherapy]] of [[oral cancer|tongue cancer]]. [[PET-CT]] scanning of a male patient in his 30's, 64 minutes after [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|fludeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F)]] was administered, shows some fluff around the tumor.}}
A patient usually presents to the physician complaining of one or more of the above [[symptoms]]. The patient will typically undergo a [[needle biopsy]] of this lesion, and a [[histopathologic]] information is available, a multidisciplinary discussion of the optimal treatment strategy will be undertaken between the [[radiation oncologist]], [[surgical oncology|surgical oncologist]], and [[medical oncology|medical oncologist]].

===Histopathology===
Throat cancers are classified according to their [[histology]] or cell structure, and are commonly referred to by their location in the oral cavity and neck. This is because where the cancer appears in the throat affects the prognosis - some throat cancers are more aggressive than others depending upon their location. The stage at which the cancer is diagnosed is also a critical factor in the prognosis of throat cancer.

====Squamous cell carcinoma====
[[Squamous cell]]s are the [[epithelium]] (tissue layer) that is the surface cells of much of the body. [[Skin]] and [[mucous membranes]] are squamous cells. This is the most common form of larynx cancer, accounting for over 90% of throat cancer.<ref name=ridge/> Squamous cell carcinoma is most likely to appear in males over 40 years of age with a history of heavy alcohol use coupled with smoking.

====Adenocarcinoma====
[[Adenocarcinoma]] is a cancer of the [[columnar epithelium]] typical of the lower [[esophagus]]. It is typical of Barrett's esophagus but may be at another location. Adenocarcinoma is thought of as a product of Barrett's esophagus.

==Prevention==
Avoidance of recognised risk factors (as described above) is the single most effective form of prevention. Regular dental examinations may identify pre-cancerous lesions in the oral cavity.

When diagnosed early, oral, head and neck cancers can be treated more easily and the chances of survival increase tremendously.

It is expected that [[HPV vaccine]]s may reduce the risk of HPV-induced head and neck cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G, Dempsey A |title=The role of HPV in head and neck cancer and review of the HPV vaccine |journal=Prev Med |volume=53 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S5–S11 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21962471 |pmc=3287051 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.08.001 |url=}}</ref>

==Management==
===General considerations===
Improvements in diagnosis and local management, as well as [[targeted therapy]], have led to improvements in quality of life and survival for head and neck cancer patients since 1992.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Al-Sarraf M |title=Treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer: historical and critical review |journal=Cancer Control |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=387–99 |year= 2002|pmid=12410178}}</ref>

After a histologic diagnosis has been established and tumor extent determined, the selection of appropriate treatment for a specific cancer depends on a complex array of variables, including tumor site, relative morbidity of various treatment options, patient performance and nutritional status, concomitant health problems, social and logistic factors, previous primary tumors, and patient preference. Treatment planning generally requires a multidisciplinary approach involving specialist surgeons and medical and radiation oncologists.

Several generalizations are useful in therapeutic decision making, but variations on these themes are numerous. Surgical resection and radiation therapy are the mainstays of treatment for most head and neck cancers and remain the standard of care in most cases. For small primary cancers without regional metastases (stage I or II), wide surgical excision alone or curative radiation therapy alone is used. More extensive primary tumors, or those with regional metastases (stage III or IV), planned combinations of pre- or postoperative radiation and complete surgical excision are generally used. More recently, as historical survival and control rates are recognized as less than satisfactory, there has been an emphasis on the use of various induction or concomitant chemotherapy regimens.

Many different treatments and therapies are used in the treatment of throat cancer. The type of treatment and therapies used are largely determined by the location of the cancer in the throat area and also the extent to which the cancer has spread at time of diagnosis. Patients’ also have the right to decide whether or not they wish to consent to a particular treatment. For example, some may decide to not undergo radiation therapy which has serious side effects if it means they will be extending their lives by only a few months or so. Others may feel that the extra time is worth it and wish to pursue the treatments.

===Surgery===
[[Surgery]] as a treatment is frequently used in most types of head and neck cancer. Usually the goal is to remove the cancerous cells entirely. This can be particularly tricky if the cancer is near the [[larynx]] and can result in the patient being unable to speak. Surgery is also commonly used to resect (remove) some or all of the cervical lymph nodes to prevent further spread of the disease.

[[CO2 laser surgery]] is also another form of treatment. [[Transoral laser microsurgery]] allows surgeons to remove tumors from the voice box with no external incisions. It also allows access to tumors that are not reachable with robotic surgery. A microscope helps the surgeon clearly view the margins of the tumor, minimizing the amount of normal tissue removed or damaged during surgery. This technique helps give the patient as much speech and swallowing function as possible after surgery.<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.org/throat-cancer/treatment.html</ref>

===Radiation therapy===
[[Image:radiation-mask.jpg|right|thumb|Radiation mask used in treatment of throat cancer]]
[[Radiation therapy]] is the most common form of treatment. There are different forms of radiation therapy, including 3D conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, which are commonly used in the treatments of cancers of the head and neck. Most patients with head and neck cancer who are treated in the United States and Europe are treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy using high energy photons.

===Chemotherapy===
[[Chemotherapy]] in throat cancer is not generally used to ''cure'' the cancer as such. Instead, it is used to provide an inhospitable environment for metastases so that they will not establish in other parts of the body. Typical chemotherapy agents are a combination of [[paclitaxel]] and [[carboplatin]]. [[Cetuximab]] is also used in the treatment of throat cancer.

[[Docetaxel]]-based chemotherapy has shown a very good response in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Taxotere is the only [[taxane]] approved by US FDA for Head and neck cancer, in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil for the induction treatment of patients with inoperable, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-docetaxel</ref>

While not specifically a chemotherapy, [[amifostine]] is often administered [[intravenously]] by a chemotherapy clinic prior to a patient's [[IMRT]] radiotherapy sessions. Amifostine protects the patient's gums and [[salivary glands]] from the effects of radiation.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Photodynamic therapy===
[[Photodynamic therapy]] may have promise in treating mucosal dysplasia and small head and neck tumors.<ref name=ridge/> [[Amphinex]] is giving good results in early clinical trials for treatment of advanced head and neck cancer.<ref>"Inoperable cancers killed by new laser surgery" The Times. UK. 3-April-2010 p15</ref>

===Targeted therapy===
[[Targeted therapy]], according to the [[National Cancer Institute]], is "a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells."  Some [[targeted therapy]] used in squamous cell cancers of the head and neck include [[cetuximab]], [[bevacizumab]] and [[erlotinib]].

The best quality data are available for [[cetuximab]] since the 2006 publication of a randomized clinical trial comparing radiation treatment plus cetuximab versus radiation treatment alone.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bonner J, Harari P, Giralt J, Azarnia N, Shin D, Cohen R, Jones C, Sur R, Raben D, Jassem J, Ove R, Kies M, Baselga J, Youssoufian H, Amellal N, Rowinsky E, Ang K |title=Radiotherapy plus cetuximab for squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=6 |pages=567–78 |year=2006 |pmid=16467544 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053422}}</ref> This study found that concurrent [[cetuximab]] and radiotherapy improves survival and locoregional disease control compared to radiotherapy alone, without a substantial increase in [[adverse effect|side effects]], as would be expected with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which is the current gold standard treatment for advanced head and neck cancer. Whilst this study is of pivotal significance, interpretation is difficult since cetuximab-radiotherapy was not directly compared to chemoradiotherapy. The results of ongoing studies to clarify the role of [[cetuximab]] in this disease are awaited with interest.

Another study evaluated the impact of adding [[cetuximab]] to conventional chemotherapy ([[cisplatin]]) versus [[cisplatin]] alone. This study found no improvement in survival or disease-free survival with the addition of [[cetuximab]] to the conventional chemotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Burtness B, Goldwasser M, Flood W, Mattar B, Forastiere A |title=Phase III randomized trial of cisplatin plus placebo compared with cisplatin plus cetuximab in metastatic/recurrent head and neck cancer: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study |journal=J Clin Oncol |volume=23 |issue=34 |pages=8646–54 |year=2005 |pmid=16314626 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.02.4646}}</ref>

However, another study which completed in March 2007 found that there was an improvement in survival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

A 2010 review concluded that the combination of cetuximab and platin/5-fluorouracil should be considered the current standard first-line regimen.<ref>http://journals.lww.com/co-oncology/Abstract/2010/05000/Advances_in_the_systemic_treatment_of_head_and.8.aspx Advances in the systemic treatment of head and neck cancers.</ref>

Head and neck cancer clinical trials employing [[bevacizumab]], an inhibitor of the [[angiogenesis]] receptor [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]], were recruiting patients {{As of|March 2007}}.

[[Erlotinib]] is an oral [[EGFR inhibitor]], and was found in one [[Phase II clinical trial]] to retard disease progression.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Soulieres D, Senzer N, Vokes E, Hidalgo M, Agarwala S, Siu L |title=Multicenter phase II study of erlotinib, an oral epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck |journal=J Clin Oncol |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=77–85 |year=2004 |pmid=14701768 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2004.06.075}}</ref>
Scientific evidence for the effectiveness of [[erlotinib]] is otherwise lacking to this point. A clinical trial evaluating the use of [[erlotinib]] in [[metastatic]] head and neck cancer is recruiting patients as of March, 2007.

==Prognosis==
Although early-stage head and neck cancers (especially laryngeal and oral cavity) have high cure rates, up to 50% of head and neck cancer patients present with advanced disease.<ref name="Gourin C, Podolsky R 2006 1093–106">{{Cite journal|author=Gourin C, Podolsky R |title=Racial disparities in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=1093–106 |year=2006 |pmid=16826042 |doi=10.1097/01.mlg.0000224939.61503.83}}</ref>
Cure rates decrease in locally advanced cases, whose probability of cure is inversely related to tumor size and even more so to the extent of regional node involvement.
Consensus panels in America ([[AJCC]]) and Europe ([[UICC]]) have established staging systems for head and neck squamous cancers. These staging systems attempt to standardize clinical trial criteria for research studies, and attempt to define prognostic categories of disease. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are staged according to the [[TNM staging system|TNM]] classification system, where T is the size and configuration of the tumor, N is the presence or absence of lymph node metastases, and M is the presence or absence of distant metastases. The T, N, and M characteristics are combined to produce a “stage” of the cancer, from I to IVB.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Iro H, Waldfahrer F |title=Evaluation of the newly updated TNM classification of head and neck carcinoma with data from 3247 patients |journal=Cancer |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=2201–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9827726 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981115)83:10<2201::AID-CNCR20>3.0.CO;2-7}}</ref>

===Residual deficits===
Even after successful definitive therapy, head and neck cancer patients face tremendous impacts on quality of life.<ref>Brook I. Neck Cancer- A Physicians’ Personal Experience. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2009;135:118.</ref> Despite marked advances in reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, intensity-modulated radiotherapy ([[IMRT]]) and conservation approaches to certain malignancies, some patients continue to have significant functional deficits.<ref>Brook I.

===Problem of second primaries===
Survival advantages provided by new treatment modalities have been undermined by the significant percentage of patients cured of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who subsequently develop second primary tumors. The incidence of second primary tumors ranges in studies from 9.1%<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jones A, Morar P, Phillips D, Field J, Husband D, Helliwell T |title=Second primary tumors in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1343–53 |year=1995 |pmid=7882285 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950315)75:6<1343::AID-CNCR2820750617>3.0.CO;2-T}}</ref>
to 23%<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cooper J, Pajak T, Rubin P, Tupchong L, Brady L, Leibel S, Laramore G, Marcial V, Davis L, Cox J |title=Second malignancies in patients who have head and neck cancer: incidence, effect on survival and implications based on the RTOG experience |journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=449–56 |year=1989 |pmid=2674073|doi=10.1016/0360-3016(89)90094-1}}</ref>
at 20 years. Second primary tumors are the major threat to long-term survival after successful therapy of early-stage HNSCC. Their high incidence results from the same carcinogenic exposure responsible for the initial primary process, called [[field cancerization]].

===Digestive system===
As it can impair a person’s ability to swallow and eat, throat cancer affects the [[digestive system]]. The difficulty in swallowing can lead to a person to [[choking|choke]] on their food in the early stages of digestion and interfere with the food’s smooth travels down into the [[esophagus]] and beyond.

The treatments for throat cancer can also be harmful to the digestive system as well as other body systems. Radiation therapy can lead to [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], which can deprive a body of vital fluids (although these may be obtained through intravenous fluids if necessary). Frequent vomiting can lead to an electrolyte imbalance which has serious consequences for the proper functioning of the heart. Frequent vomiting can also upset the balance of stomach acids which has a negative impact on the digestive system, especially the lining of the stomach and esophagus.

===Respiratory system===
In the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the [[mouth]] and behind the [[Human nose|nose]] may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the [[lung]]s and interfering with the person’s ability to [[breath]]e; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to [[lung cancer]].

===Others===
Like any [[cancer]], [[metastasize|metastasization]] affects many areas of the body, as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and [[organ (biology)|organ]] to organ. For example, if it spreads to the [[bone marrow]], it will prevent the body from producing enough [[red blood cell]]s and affects the proper functioning of the [[white blood cell]]s and the body's [[immune system]]; spreading to the [[circulatory system]] will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer can throw the [[nervous system]] into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body.

===Symptoms and side effects===
Patients with head and neck cancer may experience the following symptoms and treatment side effects:<ref name=ridge/>
*Eating problems
*Pain associated with lesions
*[[Mucositis]]
*[[Nephrotoxicity]] and [[ototoxicity]]
*[[Xerostomia]]

The number of new cases of head and neck cancers in the United States was 40,490 in 2006, accounting for about 3% of adult malignancies. 11,170 patients died of their disease in 2006.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jemal A, Siegel R, Ward E, Murray T, Xu J, Smigal C, Thun M |title=Cancer statistics, 2006 |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=106–30 |year= 2006|pmid=16514137 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.56.2.106}}</ref> The worldwide incidence exceeds half a million cases annually. In North America and Europe, the tumors usually arise from the oral cavity, oropharynx, or larynx, whereas nasopharyngeal cancer is more common in the Mediterranean countries and in the Far East. In Southeast China and Taiwan, head and neck cancer, specifically [[nasopharyngeal cancer]] is the most common cause of death in young men.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Titcomb C |title=High incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Asia |journal=J Insur Med |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=235–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11558403}}</ref>

* In 2008, there were 22,900 cases of oral cavity cancer, 12,250 cases of laryngeal cancer, and 12,410 cases of pharyngeal cancer in the United States.<ref name=ridge/>
