'''Mesenteric ischemia''' (or '''Mesenteric ischaemia''' - British English) is a medical condition in which inflammation and injury of the small intestine result from inadequate blood supply.<ref name="pmid10784596">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0016-5085(00)70183-1|noedit}}</ref><ref name="pmid10784595">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0016-5085(00)70182-X|noedit}}</ref> Causes of the reduced blood flow can include changes in the systemic circulation (e.g. [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]) or local factors such as [[vasoconstriction|constriction of blood vessels]] or a [[blood clot]]. It is more common in the elderly.<ref name="pmid11432300">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0889-8553(05)70190-4|noedit}}</ref><ref name="pmid9146714">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0039-6109(05)70550-8|noedit}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Three progressive phases of ischemic colitis have been described:<ref>

*A ''hyper active'' stage occurs first, in which the primary symptoms are severe abdominal pain and the passage of bloody stools. Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase.

*A ''paralytic'' phase can follow if ischemia continues; in this phase, the abdominal pain becomes more widespread, the belly becomes more tender to the touch, and bowel [[peristalsis|motility]] decreases, resulting in abdominal bloating, no further bloody stools, and absent bowel sounds on exam.

*Finally, a ''shock'' phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining. This can result in [[Shock (medical)|shock]] and [[metabolic acidosis]] with [[dehydration]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]], and confusion. Patients who progress to this phase are often critically ill and require [[intensive care]].

===Clinical findings===
Symptoms of mesenteric ischemia vary and can be acute (especially if embolic),<ref name="pmid15159262">{{cite journal |author=Oldenburg WA, Lau LL, Rodenberg TJ, Edmonds HJ, Burger CD |title=Acute mesenteric ischemia: a clinical review |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=164 |issue=10 |pages=1054–62 |year=2004 |pmid=15159262 | doi=10.1001/archinte.164.10.1054}}</ref> subacute, or chronic.<ref name="pmid2691119">{{cite journal |author=Font VE, Hermann RE, Longworth DL |title=Chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis: difficult diagnosis and therapy |journal=Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine |volume=56 |issue=8 |pages=823–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2691119}}</ref>

Vasc. Surg. |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=445–52 |year=2002 |pmid=11877691|doi=10.1067/mva.2002.120373  }}</ref> In a series of 58 patients with mesenteric ischemia due to mixed causes:<ref name="pmid11877691"/>
* [[abdominal pain]] was present in 95% (median of 24 hours duration). The other three patients presented with shock and [[metabolic acidosis]].
* [[nausea]] in 44%
* [[vomiting]] in 35%
* [[diarrhea]] in 35%
* [[heart rate]] > 100 in 33%
* '[[Rectal bleeding|blood per rectum]]' in 16% (not stated if this number also included occult blood - presumably not)
* [[constipation]] 7%

===Diagnostic heuristics===
In the absence of adequate quantitative studies to guide diagnosis, various heuristics help guide diagnosis:
* Mesenteric ischemia "''should be suspected when individuals, especially those at high risk for acute mesenteric ischemia, develop severe and persisting abdominal pain that is disproportionate to their abdominal findings''"<ref name="pmid10784595"/>
* Regarding mesenteric arterial thrombosis or embolism: "''...early symptoms are present and are relative mild in 50% of cases for three to four days before medical attention is sought''".<ref name="isbn9780195175455">

* Regarding mesenteric arterial thrombosis or embolism: "''Any patient with an arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation who complains of abdominal pain is highly suspected of having embolization to the superior mesenteric artery until proved otherwise''".<ref name="isbn9780195175455"/>
* Regarding nonocclusive intestinal ischemia: "''Any patient who takes digitalis and diuretics and who complains of abdominal pain must be considered to have nonocclusive ischemia until proved otherwise''".<ref name="isbn9780195175455"/>

==Diagnosis==
It is difficult to diagnose mesenteric ischemia early.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Evennett NJ, Petrov MS, Mittal A, Windsor JA |title=Systematic review and pooled estimates for the diagnostic accuracy of serological markers for intestinal ischemia |journal=World J Surg |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1374–83 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19424744 |doi=10.1007/s00268-009-0074-7 |url=}}</ref>  One must also differentiate [[ischemic colitis]], which often resolves on its own, from the more immediately life-threatening condition of acute mesenteric ischemia of the [[small bowel]].

===Blood tests===
In a series of 58 patients with mesenteric ischemia due to mixed causes:<ref name="pmid11877691"/>
* [[White blood cell count]] >10.5 in 98% (probably an overestimate as only tested in 81% of patients)
* [[Lactic acid]] elevated 91% (probably an overestimate as only tested in 57% of patients)

===Devices for diagnosis during endoscopy===
A number of devices have been used to assess the sufficiency of oxygen delivery to the colon. The earliest devices were based on tonometry, and required time to equilibrate and estimate the pHi, roughly an estimate of local CO2 levels. The first device approved by the U.S. FDA (in 2004) used visible light spectroscopy to analyze capillary oxygen levels. Use during Aortic Aneurysm repair detected when colon oxygen levels fell below sustainable levels, allowing real-time repair. In several studies, specificity has been 83% for chronic mesenteric ischemia and 90% or higher for acute colonic ischemia, with a sensitivity of 71%-92%. This device must be placed using endoscopy, however.,,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee ES, Bass A, Arko FR, et al. | title = Intraoperative colon mucosal oxygen saturation during aortic surgery | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–24 | year = 2006| pmid = 16978651 | doi = 10.1016/j.jss.2006.05.014 | journal = The Journal of surgical research}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Friedland S, Benaron D, Coogan S, et al. | title = Diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia by visible light spectroscopy during endoscopy | journal = Gastrointest Endosc | volume = 65| issue = 2 | pages = 294–300 | year = 2007| pmid = 17137857 | doi = 10.1016/j.gie.2006.05.007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee ES, Pevec WC, Link DP, et al. | title = Use of T-stat to Predict Colonic Ischemia during and after Endovascular Aneurysm Repair: A case report | journal = J Vasc Surg | volume = 47| issue = 3 | pages = 632–634 | year = 2008| pmid = 18295116 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2007.09.037 | pmc = 2707776}}</ref>

===Computed tomography===
[[Computed tomography]] (CT scan) is often used.<ref name="pmid3336673">{{cite journal | author = Alpern M, Glazer G, Francis I | title = Ischemic or infarcted bowel: CT findings | journal = Radiology | volume = 166 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = 149–52 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3336673}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Taourel P, Deneuville M, Pradel J, Régent D, Bruel J | title = Acute mesenteric ischemia: diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT | journal = Radiology | volume = 199 | issue = 3 | pages = 632–6 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8637978|doi=|url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/reprint/199/3/632.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The accuracy of the [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] depends on whether a small bowel obstruction (SBO) is present.<ref name="pmid15835585">{{cite journal |author=Staunton M, Malone DE |title=Can acute mesenteric ischemia be ruled out using computed tomography?

===Mesenteric angiography===
As the etiology of the ischemia can be due to embolic or thrombotic occlusion of the mesenteric vessels or nonocclusive ichemia, the best way to differentiate between the etiologies is through the use of mesenteric angiography. Though it has serious risks, angiography provides the possibility of direct infusion of vasodilators in the setting of nonocclusive ischemia <ref>Kao, Lillian S., and Tammy Lee.

==Treatment==
"Surgical revascularisation remains the treatment of choice for mesenteric  ischaemia, but thrombolytic medical treatment and vascular interventional  radiological techniques have a growing role".<ref name="pmid12816826">{{cite journal |author=Sreenarasimhaiah J |title=Diagnosis and management of intestinal ischaemic disorders |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7403 |pages=1372–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12816826 | doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7403.1372 |pmc=1126251}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends on prompt diagnosis (less than 12–24 hours and before gangrene)<ref name="pmid10784596"/> and the underlying cause:<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Schoots IG, Koffeman GI, Legemate DA, Levi M, van Gulik TM |title=Systematic review of survival after acute mesenteric ischaemia according to disease aetiology |journal=The British journal of surgery |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=17–27 |year=2004 |pmid=14716789 |doi=10.1002/bjs.4459}}</ref>
