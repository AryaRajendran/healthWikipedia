'''Asymmetric dimethylarginine''' (ADMA) is a naturally occurring chemical found in [[blood plasma]]. It is a [[metabolism|metabolic]] [[by-product]] of continual [[protein]] modification processes in the [[cytoplasm]] of all human cells. It is closely related to L-[[arginine]], a conditionally-essential [[amino acid]]. ADMA interferes with L-arginine in the production of [[nitric oxide]], a key chemical involved in normal [[endothelium|endothelial]] function and, by extension, [[circulatory system|cardiovascular]] health.

==Discovery==
{{section-diffuse|date=July 2012}}
Patrick Vallance and his [[London]] co-workers first noted the interference role for asymmetric dimethylarginine.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Vallance P., Leone A.,  Calver A.,  Collier J., Moncada S. | year=1992 | title=Endogenous dimethyl-arginine as an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis | journal=J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol | volume=20 |issue=Suppli. 12 | pages=S60–S62}}</ref>
Today biochemical and clinical research continues into the role of ADMA in [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[erectile dysfunction]] and certain forms of [[kidney]] disease.

==Synthesis and regulation in the body==
[[Image:Heart-and-lungs.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Cardiovascular]] effects have been linked to ADMA]]
Asymmetric dimethylarginine is created in protein [[methylation]], a common mechanism of post-translational protein modification. This reaction is catalyzed by an [[enzyme]] set called S-adenosylmethionine protein N-methyltransferases (protein methylases I and II).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rawal N, Rajpurohit R, Lischwe MA, Williams KR, Paik WK, Kim S | title=Structural specificity of substrate for S-adenosylmethionine:protein arginine N-methyltransferases | journal=Biochim Biophys Acta | year=1995 | pages=11–8 | volume=1248 | issue=1 | pmid=7536038 | doi=10.1016/0167-4838(94)00213-Z}}</ref>
The methyl groups transferred to create ADMA are derived from the [[methyl]] group donor S-adenosylmethionine, an intermediate in the metabolism of [[homocysteine]]. (Homocysteine is an important blood chemical because it is also a [[genetic marker|marker]] of cardiovascular disease). After [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]], ADMA migrates into the [[extracellular]] space and thence into blood plasma.  Asymmetric dimethylarginine is measured using [[high-performance liquid chromatography]].

ADMA concentrations are substantially elevated by native or oxidized [[LDL]] [[cholesterol]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Boger RH, Sydow K, Borlak J, Thum T, Lenzen H, Schubert B, Tsikas D, Bode-Boger SM | title=LDL cholesterol upregulates synthesis of asymmetrical dimethylarginine in human endothelial cells: involvement of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases | journal=Circ Res | date=21 July 2000| pages=99–105 | volume=87 | issue=2 | pmid=10903992 | url=http://circres.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/87/2/99 | doi=10.1161/01.RES.87.2.99 }}</ref>
Thus a spiralling effect occurs with high endothelial LDL levels causing greater ADMA values, which in turn inhibit NO production needed to promote [[vasodilation]]. The elimination of ADMA occurs through urine excretion and metabolism by the enzyme [[dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase]] (DDAH). The role of homocysteine as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease is suggested to be mediated by homocysteine down-regulating production of DDAH in the body.  [[Polyphenol antioxidant]]s also play a role in down-regulating homocysteine.

==ADMA and suggested lines of therapeutic research==
[[Image:Kidney section.jpg|thumb|right|160px|ADMA may play a role in certain forms of [[kidney]] disease]]
With raised levels of ADMA seemingly to be associated with adverse human health consequences for cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, and also a wide range of diseases of the elderly, the possible lowering of ADMA levels may have important therapeutic effects. However, it has yet to be established whether ADMA levels can be manipulated and, more important, if this results in useful clinical benefits.

The association of ADMA with abnormalities of lipid regulation suggested that supplements of [[fatty acid|free fatty acids]] might manipulate ADMA levels. However, research has failed to show that these have an effect.<ref name=NutrMetab2006-Eid>{{cite journal | author=Eid HM, Arnesen H, Hjerkinn EM, Lyberg T, Ellingsen I, Seljeflot I | title=Effect of diet and omega-3 fatty acid intervention on asymmetric dimethylarginine | journal=Nutr Metab (Lond) | year=2006 | pages=4 | volume=3 | pmid=16396682 | url =http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/3/1/4 | doi=10.1186/1743-7075-3-4 | pmc=1343562 | issue=1}}</ref><ref name=HormMetabRes2005-Namiranian>{{cite journal | author=Namiranian K, Mittermayer F, Artwohl M, Pleiner J, Schaller G, Mayer BX, Bayerle-Eder M, Roden M, Baumgartner-Parzer S, Wolzt M | title=Free fatty acids do not acutely increase asymmetrical dimethylarginine concentrations | journal=Horm Metab Res | year=2005 | pages=768–72 | volume=37 | issue=12 | pmid=16372232 | doi=10.1055/s-2005-921100}}</ref>

Direct alteration of ADMA levels with supplements of L-arginine have been suggested.<ref name="VascMed2003-Bode-Boger">{{cite journal | author=Bode-Boger SM, Muke J, Surdacki A, Brabant G, Boger RH, Frolich JC | title=Oral L-arginine improves endothelial function in healthy individuals older than 70 years | journal=Vasc Med | year=2003 | pages=77–81 | volume=8 | issue=2 | pmid=14518608 | doi=10.1191/1358863x03vm474oa}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=John P. Cooke | title=The Cardiovascular Cure | publisher=Random House | year=2002 | isbn=0-7679-0881-3}}</ref>
The hope is that such intervention might not only improve endothelial function but also reduce clinical symptoms of overt cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rector TS, Bank AJ, Mullen KA, Tschumperlin LK, Sih R, Pillai K, Kubo SH | title=Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of supplemental oral L-arginine in patients with heart failure | journal=Circulation | date=15 June 1996| pages=2135–41 | volume=93 | issue=12 | pmid=8925582 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/93/12/2135 | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.93.12.2135 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Ceremuzynski L, Chamiec T, Herbaczynska-Cedro K | title=Effect of supplemental oral L-arginine on exercise capacity in patients with stable angina pectoris | journal=Am J Cardiol | year=1997 | pages=331–3 | volume=80 | issue=3 | pmid=9264427 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00354-8}}</ref>
However studies show inconsistency in results in a clinical context,<ref name="JNutr2004-Loscalzo">{{cite journal | author=Loscalzo J | title=L-arginine and atherothrombosis | journal=J Nutr | year=2004 | pages=2798S–2800S; discussion 2818S–2819S | volume=134 | issue=10 Suppl | pmid=15465788 }}</ref>
and the recent results with manipulating homocysteine levels warrant extreme care with what clinical outcomes might arise from this approach.

[[Statin]]s, as well as affecting circulating cholesterol levels, also increase nitric oxide levels and so have a direct effect on blood supply to the heart. Elevated levels of ADMA seems to modify this effect and so may have consequences for patients' responsiveness to taking statins.<ref name="VascMed2003-Janatuinen">{{cite journal | author=Janatuinen T, Laakso J, Laaksonen R, Vesalainen R, Nuutila P, Lehtimaki T, Raitakari OT, Knuuti J | title=Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine modifies the effect of pravastatin on myocardial blood flow in young adults | journal=Vasc Med | year=2003 | pages=185–9 | volume=8 | issue=3 | pmid=14989559 | doi=10.1191/1358863x03vm490oa}}</ref>
