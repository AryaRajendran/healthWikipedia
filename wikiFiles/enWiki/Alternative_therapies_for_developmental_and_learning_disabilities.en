'''Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities''' include a range of practices used in the treatment of [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD]], [[Asperger syndrome]], [[autism]], [[Down syndrome]] and other [[developmental disability|developmental]] and [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]]. Treatments include changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[dietary supplement]]s, [[biofeedback]], [[chelation therapy]], [[homeopathy]], [[massage]] and [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]]. These therapies generally rely on theories that have little scientific basis, lacking well-controlled, large, randomized trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy; small trials that have reported beneficial effects can be generally explained by the ordinary [[regression to the mean|waxing and waning of the underlying conditions]].<ref name=Weber/>

==Treatment needs==
There are a number of non-standard treatments for developmental and learning disabilities. There is a call for alternative therapies particularly when a condition lacks a reliable remediation. For example, there is no cure for autism; the main goals of mainstream behavioral and medical management are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title= Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |author= Myers SM, Johnson CP, Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}</ref> Some alternative therapies, such as [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]]s, may be appealing to some parents because the treatment recommended by most experts is thought to be "cold and manipulative".<ref>{{Cite book| last=Vyse| first=Stuart| chapter=Where Do Fads Come From?| editor-last= Jacobson, Foxx & Mulick| editor-first=| title=Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities.

Alternative treatments to a [[Methylphenidate|stimulant medication]] range from natural products to [[psychotherapeutic]] techniques and highly technological interventions. It has been argued that although texts that promote alternative therapies do not directly accuse parents of inadequacy, the claims that the disability is caused by certain factors, such as poor nutrition, supports the culture of mother-blame.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Malacrida| title = Alternative Therapies and Attention Deficit Disorder: Discourses of Maternal Responsibility and Risk| journal = Gender & Society| volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 366–385| year = 2002| url =http://gas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/16/3/366| doi = 10.1177/0891243202016003006| first1 = C.}}</ref>

== Prevalence ==
From 12% to 64% of families of a child with ADHD use an alternative therapy, with the lower estimates likely come from narrower definitions of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM).<ref name=Weber>{{cite journal |journal= Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=983–1006 |title= Complementary and alternative medical therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism |author= Weber W, Newmark S |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.09.006 |pmid=18061787}}</ref> School teachers, family and friends are the most common source of suggestion of alternative therapies for ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Stubberfield| title = Utilization of alternative therapies in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder| journal = Journal of paediatrics and child health | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 450–453| year = 1999| url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdf?vid=2&hid=112&sid=93fb7429-4ea3-4507-a752-330a00d6c0a5%40sessionmgr2| doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1754.1999.355401.x| pmid = 10571757| first1 = T| last2 = Parry| first2 = T| last3 = Parry| first3 = TS}}</ref> In 2003, 64 percent of families of a child with special health care needs reported that they use alternative therapies. These therapies included [[spiritual healing]], [[massage]], [[chiropractic]], [[herbs]] and special [[diet (nutrition)|diets]], [[homeopathy]], [[self hypnosis]] and other methods of [[alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]]. The need for an alternative therapy was related to the child's condition and to its evaluation as repairable or not.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Sanders et al.| title = Use of Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapies Among Children With Special Health Care Needs in Southern Arizona | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 111 | issue = 3| pages = 584–587| year = 2003| url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/111/3/584?ck=nck| doi = 10.1542/peds.111.3.584| pmid = 12612240| first1 = H| last2 = Davis| first2 = MF| last3 = Duncan| first3 = B| last4 = Meaney| first4 = FJ| last5 = Haynes| first5 = J| last6 = Barton| first6 = LL}}</ref> A 2008 study found that about 40% of Hong Kong children with [[autism spectrum disorder]] were treated with CAM, with the most popular therapies being [[acupuncture]], [[sensory integration therapy]], and [[Chinese herbology]]; the 40% is a lower prevalence than in Canada and the U.S., where biological-based therapies such as special diets predominate.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Wong VC |title= Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD): comparison of Chinese and western culture (part A) |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=454–63 |year=2009 |pmid=18784992 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0644-9}}</ref> In the U.S. CAM is used by an estimated 20–40% of healthy children, 30–70% of children with special health care needs, and 52–95% of children with autism, and a 2009 survey of U.S. [[primary care physician]]s found that more of them recommended than discouraged [[multivitamin]]s, [[essential fatty acid]]s, [[melatonin]], and [[probiotics]] as CAM [[treatments for autism]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Golnik AE, Ireland M |title= Complementary alternative medicine for children with autism: a physician survey |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume= 39|issue= 7|pages= 996–1005|year=2009 |pmid=19280328 |doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0714-7}}</ref>

==Evidence basis==
Complementary and alternative medicine often lacks support in [[Evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]], so its safety and [[efficacy]] are often questionable. Some therapists who advocate CAM may claim to cure many conditions or disabilities that are not diseases and therefore cannot be "cured".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

While some experts encourage parents to be open-minded, others argue that treatments and services with no proven efficacy have ''opportunity costs'' because they displace the opportunity to participate in efficient treatments and services.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Newsom C. and Hovanovitz C. A.| chapter=The Nature and Value of Empirically Validated Interventions| editor-last= Jacobson, Foxx & Mulick| editor-first=| title=Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities.

Lilienfeld, <blockquote>many individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either. As a result, they may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. Thus, even ineffective treatments that are by themselves innocuous can indirectly produce negative consequences.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Lilienfeld S.

There is often little or no scientific evidence for effectiveness of alternative therapies.<ref name=Weber/><ref>Lack of scientific evidence for CAM:

Some phenomena to be considered when evaluating studies are the [[placebo effect]], the [[Hawthorne effect]] and different types of attentional and motivational effects. Doubtless, people with disabilities may benefit from some alternative therapies, at least for relaxation, social interaction, personal development and self-esteem. This can be important because many children with learning difficulties suffer from low self-esteem.
   
For instance, a randomised controlled trial with dyslexic children was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of [[Sunflower therapy]] which includes [[applied kinesiology]], [[physical manipulation]], [[massage]], [[homeopathy]], [[herbal remedies]] and [[neuro-linguistic programming]]. There were no significant improvements in cognitive nor literacy test performance associated with the treatment, but there were significant improvements in [[self-esteem]] for the treatment group. This study did not control for the [[placebo effect]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bull, L.| title = Sunflower therapy for children with specific learning difficulties (dyslexia): A randomised, controlled trial | journal = Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice | issue = 1 | pages = 15–24 | date = February 2007 | url = http://rss.sciencedirect.com/getMessage?registrationId=IDHAIEHAJJHBQDIBKDHHIMJIJFIEKKKAMVJILLKHIN}}</ref>

==Precautions==
Because many alternative therapies have not been evaluated in scientific studies there may be no guarantee for their safety. In most countries, with the exception of [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]], complementary medical disciplines have not been state registered. This means there is no law to forbid anyone from setting up as a practitioner even with no qualification nor experience. There are also a lot of 'universities' offering all kinds of alternative medicine degrees for a fee, and their certificates can look very real. These organisations may, on the other hand, offer ongoing training and an insurance to their registered members.

Experts of alternative therapies advise customers to be careful when choosing a therapist. Before taking a therapy, it is wise to find out whether or not previous customers recommend it, the therapist has a qualification and is a registered practitioner, whether the therapy could be dangerous, how much the treatment costs, and whether money will be refunded if the therapy does not work.
