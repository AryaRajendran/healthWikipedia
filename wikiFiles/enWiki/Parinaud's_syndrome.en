'''Parinaud's Syndrome''', also known as '''dorsal midbrain syndrome''' is a group of abnormalities of [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] and [[pupil]] dysfunction. It is caused by [[lesion]]s of the upper [[brain stem]] and is named for [[Henri Parinaud]]<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1906}}</ref><ref>H. Parinaud. Paralysie des mouvements associés des yeux. Archives de neurologie, Paris, 1883, 5: 145-172.</ref> (1844–1905), considered to be the father of French [[ophthalmology]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Parinaud's Syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities of eye movement and pupil dysfunction, characterized by:

# Paralysis of upgaze: Downward gaze is usually preserved. This vertical palsy is [[supranuclear]], so [[doll's head maneuver]] should elevate the eyes, but eventually all upward gaze mechanisms fail.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1215453-overview] Neuro-Opthalmic Examination</ref>
# Pseudo-[[Argyll Robertson pupils]]: Accommodative paresis ensues, and pupils become mid-dilated and show light-near dissociation.
# Convergence-Retraction [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]: Attempts at upward gaze often produce this phenomenon. On fast up-gaze, the eyes pull in and the globes retract. The easiest way to bring out this reaction is to ask the patient to follow down-going stripes on an optokinetic drum.
# [[Eyelid]] retraction ([[Collier's sign]])
# Conjugate down gaze in the primary position: "setting-sun sign". Neurosurgeons will often see this sign most commonly in patients with failed ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

It is also commonly associated with bilateral [[papilledema]]. It has less commonly been associated with spasm of [[Accommodation reflex|accommodation]] on attempted upward gaze, pseudoabducens palsy (also known as thalamic [[esotropia]]) or slower movements of the abducting eye than the adducting eye during horizontal saccades, see-saw [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] and associated ocular motility deficits including [[skew deviation]], [[oculomotor nerve]] palsy, [[trochlear nerve]] palsy and [[internuclear ophthalmoplegia]].

==Causes==
[[image:Parinaud's syndrome.svg|400px|right|thumb|cross section of [[midbrain]] showing lesion]]
Parinaud's Syndrome results from injury, either direct or compressive, to the dorsal [[midbrain]].  Specifically, compression or ischemic damage of the [[mesencephalic]] tectum, including the [[superior colliculus]] adjacent [[oculomotor]] (origin of [[cranial nerve]] III) and [[Edinger-Westphal_nucleus|Edinger-Westphal]] nuclei, causing dysfunction to the motor function of the eye.

Classically, it has been associated with three major groups:

# Young patients with [[brain tumors]] in the [[pineal gland]] or [[midbrain]]: [[pinealoma]] ([[Germinoma#Intracranial_germinoma|intracranial germinomas]]) are the most common lesion producing this syndrome.
# Women in their 20s-30s with [[multiple sclerosis]]
# Older patients following [[stroke]] of the upper brainstem

However, any other compression, ischemia or damage to this region can produce these phenomena: obstructive [[hydrocephalus]], midbrain hemorrhage, [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation]], trauma and brainstem [[toxoplasmosis]] infection. Neoplasms and giant aneurysms of the [[posterior fossa]] have also been associated with the midbrain syndrome.

Vertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia has also been associated with metabolic disorders, such as [[Niemann-Pick disease]], [[Wilson's disease]], [[kernicterus]], and [[barbiturate]] overdose.

==Prognosis and Treatment==
The eye findings of Parinaud's Syndrome generally improve slowly over months, especially with resolution of the causative factor; continued resolution after the first 3-6 months of onset is uncommon. However, rapid resolution after normalization of intracranial pressure following placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt has been reported.

Treatment is primarily directed towards etiology of the dorsal midbrain syndrome. A thorough workup, including neuroimaging is essential to rule out anatomic lesions or other causes of this syndrome. Visually significant upgaze palsy can be relieved with bilateral inferior rectus recessions. Retraction nystagmus and convergence movement are usually improved with this procedure as well.
