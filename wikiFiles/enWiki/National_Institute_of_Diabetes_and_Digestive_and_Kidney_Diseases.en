==National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases==

'''full protection:''' high level of unauthorized modifications; government agency.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, conducts and supports research on many of the most serious diseases affecting public health. The Institute supports much of the clinical research on the diseases of internal medicine and related subspecialty fields as well as many basic science disciplines.

== Mission<ref name="Almanac">The NIH Almanac: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NIDDK.htm. 13 Apr. 2012. Web. 24 Aug. 2012</ref> ==

The mission of NIDDK is to conduct and support medical research and research training and to disseminate science-based information on diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases, to improve people’s health and quality of life.

== Overview<ref name="Almanac" /> ==

The NIDDK supports a wide range of medical research through grants to universities and other medical research institutions across the country. The Institute also supports government scientists who conduct basic, translational, and clinical research across a broad spectrum of research topics and serious, chronic diseases and conditions related to the Institute's mission. In addition, the NIDDK supports research training for students and scientists at various stages of their careers and a range of education and outreach programs to bring science-based information to patients and their families, health care professionals, and the public.

External research funded by the NIDDK is organized into three scientific program divisions: Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases; Digestive Diseases and Nutrition; and Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases.

The NIDDK’s overarching principles in moving research forward include:maintaining a vigorous, investigator-initiated research portfolio that supports cross-cutting science that can be broadly applied to many disease-specific research areas; supporting pivotal clinical studies and trials, with a focus on substantial participation from minority and underserved groups; preserving a stable pool of talented new investigators; fostering exceptional research training and mentoring opportunities; and ensuring that science-based health information reaches patients, their families, health care providers and the public through communications and outreach activities.

== Establishment and History of the Institute<ref name="60 Years">NIDDK: 60 Years of Discovery, 1950-2010. http://www2.niddk.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/EBC94D8F-1ABB-4B07-814D-B0FF37E5EBF1/0/FebDoc2011_60thAnniversary_508.pdf. 2012. Web. 28 Aug. 2012</ref> ==

On August 15, 1950, President Harry S. Truman signed the Omnibus Medical Research Act into law, establishing the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, the forerunner to the NIDDK. In the ensuing years, the Institute was renamed several times. In 1986, one of the Institute's former Divisions became the core of a new, separate NIH component focused on arthritis and other diseases, and the Institute acquired its current name: the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

== NIDDK Director Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D., M.A.C.P.<ref name="Almanac" /><ref name="Rodgers">Griffin Rodgers, MD: NIDDK. http://www2.niddk.nih.gov/NIDDKLabs/IntramuralFaculty/RodgersGriffin.htm. 17 Dec. 2008. Web. 27 Aug. 2012</ref> ==

Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D., M.A.C.P., was named director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)—one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—on April 1, 2007. Dr. Rodgers had served as the NIDDK's acting director since March 2006 and was the Institute's deputy director from 2001-2009. Dr. Rodgers also has been chief of the Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch since 1998. The branch is now administratively managed by the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. 

Dr. Rodgers received his undergraduate, graduate, and medical degrees from Brown University in Providence, RI. He performed his residency and chief residency in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital and the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. His fellowship training in hematology/oncology was through a joint program of the NIH with George Washington University and the Washington Veterans Administration Medical Center. In addition to his medical and research training, Dr. Rodgers earned a master's degree in business administration, with a focus on the business of medicine, from Johns Hopkins University in 2005. 

As a research investigator, Dr. Rodgers is widely recognized for his contributions to the development of the first effective, and now FDA-approved, therapy for sickle cell anemia. He was a principal investigator in clinical trials to develop therapy for patients with sickle cell disease. He also performed basic research that focused on understanding the molecular basis of how certain drugs induce gamma-globin gene expression. Recently, he and his collaborators have reported on a modified blood stem-cell transplant regimen that is highly effective in reversing sickle cell disease in adults and is associated with relatively low toxicity.

Dr. Rodgers has been honored for his research with numerous awards, including the 1998 Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award, the 2000 Arthur S. Flemming Award, the Legacy of Leadership Award in 2002, and a Mastership from the American College of Physicians in 2005.

Dr. Rodgers has been an invited professor at medical schools and hospitals in France, Italy, China, Japan, and Korea. He has been honored with many named lectureships at American medical centers. He has published over 200 original research articles, reviews, and book chapters and has edited four books and monographs.

Dr. Rodgers served as governor to the American College of Physicians for the Department of Health and Human Services from 1994 to 1997. He is a member of the American Society of Hematology, the American Society of Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, among others. He served as chair of the Hematology Subspecialty Board and a member of the American Board of Internal Medicine Board of Directors. Dr. Rodgers is board certified in internal medicine, emergency medicine, and hematology.

*the [http://www2.niddk.nih.gov/Funding/Grants/GrantsManagement.htm Grants Management Branch], the focal point for all business-related activities associated with the negotiation, award, and administration of grants and cooperative agreements within the NIDDK 
*the [http://www2.niddk.nih.gov/Funding/Grants/GrantReview/ Scientific Review Branch], which coordinates the initial scientific peer review of applications submitted in response to Request for Applications (RFAs), training and career awards, program projects, multi-center clinical trials, and research contracts, including Loan Repayment Program applications. Most R01s, fellowship, and SBIR grant applications are reviewed in the [http://cms.csr.nih.gov/ Center for Scientific Review]. 
*the Office of Research Evaluation and Operations (OREO), within the DEA Office of the Director, oversees and coordinates disease coding/reporting for the NIDDK extramural program, manages the Early Notification System and NIH Guide publication process associated with NIDDK Funding Opportunity Announcements, and supports NIDDK Advisory Council activities.  The office also facilitates harmonization of activities among NIDDK's four extramural divisions and coordinates or performs special projects at the request of the NIDDK leadership.

'''NIDDK Clearinghouses'''<ref name="Clearinghouses">NIDDK Clearinghouses Publications Catalog. https://catalog.niddk.nih.gov/index.cfm. Web. 28 Aug. 2012</ref>

The NIDDK operates three clearinghouses that provide information about diabetes, digestive diseases, and kidney and urologic diseases to patients, their families, health professionals, and the general public: 

*the [http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/ National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse] (NDIC) 
*the [http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse] (NDDIC) 
*the [http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/ National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse] (NKUDIC) 

Each clearinghouse was authorized by Congress to increase knowledge and understanding about these areas by disseminating information.

The clearinghouses launched two additional information services in 2004 to focus on additional NIDDK-related conditions such as hormone and blood disorders: 

*the [http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/ National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service]
*the [http://hematologic.niddk.nih.gov/ National Hematologic Diseases Information Service]. 

The clearinghouses and information services translate science into easy-to-understand information for the public. They provide print and online information and resources for patients, the public, and health professionals, including many easy-to-read publications available in several languages and in large print. The clearinghouses answer inquiries and work closely with professional and patient-advocacy organizations and U.S. government agencies to coordinate resources on relevant topics. 

'''NIDDK Public Awareness Campaigns'''<ref name="Almanac" />

The clearinghouses also manage three public awareness campaigns directed at conditions that are frequently underdiagnosed or untreated: 

The [http://celiac.nih.gov/ Celiac Disease Awareness Campaign] promotes public awareness about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease. The NDDIC-based campaign provides current, comprehensive, science-based information about the disease, including news, e-blasts, feature stories, educational materials and resources, practice guidelines, and contacts for patient-advocacy and not-for-profit organizations devoted to celiac disease awareness.

The NDDIC's [http://bowelcontrol.nih.gov/index.aspx "Let's Talk about Bowel Control"] awareness campaign provides resources to health care providers and the public about how to talk about and manage problems with bowel control. Resources include news, information about research and clinical trials, fact sheets, online tools, and links to other organizations.

To raise awareness about the common but infrequently discussed problem of urinary incontinence, the NKUDIC created the "[http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/bladdercontrol/ Bladder Control for Women]" awareness campaign, which promotes resources to help women understand the condition and talk about it with their doctors. A booklet, fact sheets, online diary, poster, and other resources are available from the campaign.
