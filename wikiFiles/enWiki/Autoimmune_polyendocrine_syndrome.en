In [[medicine]], '''autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes''', also called '''polyglandular autoimmune syndrome''' (PGAS),<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/88/7/2983.full}}</ref> are a heterogeneous group<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eisenbarth GS, Gottlieb PA |title=Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=350 |issue=20 |pages=2068–79 |year=2004 |pmid=15141045 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra030158 |url=}}</ref> of [[rare disease]]s characterised by [[autoimmune]] activity against more than one [[endocrine organ]]s, although non-endocrine organs can be affected.

There are three "autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes", and a number of other diseases which have endocrine autoimmunity as one of their features.

== The syndromes ==
* [[Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1]] (APECED or Whitaker's syndrome)
* [[Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2]] (Schmidt's syndrome)
* The most serious but rarest form is the ''[[Sex linkage|X-linked]] polyendocrinopathy, immunodeficiency and [[diarrhea]]''-syndrome, also called [[IPEX (syndrome)|XLAAD]] (X-linked autoimmunity and allergic dysregulation) or [[IPEX (syndrome)|IPEX]] (immune dysfunction, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy, X-linked). This is due to mutation of the ''[[FOXP3]]'' gene on the X chromosome.<ref name="pmid18481161">{{cite journal |author=Yong PL, Russo P, Sullivan KE |title=Use of Sirolimus in IPEX and IPEX-Like Children |journal=J. Clin.

Boys are affected, while girls are carriers and might suffer mild disease.

== Other diseases ==
Other diseases featuring polycrine autoimmunity:
* Chromosomal abnormalities ([[Down's syndrome]]) increase the risk of endocrine autoimmunity
* [[POEMS syndrome]] - the ''E'' is for endocrinopathy; the cause is a [[paraprotein]] excreted by a plasmacytoma or [[multiple myeloma]]; other features are [[polyneuropathy]], organomegaly ([[hepatomegaly]] and [[splenomegaly]]), M-protein (paraprotein) and skin changes.
* Several{{Which|date=April 2009}} very [[rare disease]]s.

== Management ==
In principle, the component diseases are managed as usual. The challenge is to detect the possibility of any of the above syndromes, and to anticipate other manifestations. For example, in a patient with known Type 2 autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome but no features of [[Addison's disease]], regular screening for [[antibody|antibodies]] against 21-hydroxylase (a feature of Addison's) may prompt early intervention and [[hydrocortisone]] replacement to prevent characteristic crises.
