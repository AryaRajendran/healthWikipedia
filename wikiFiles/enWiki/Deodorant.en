'''Deodorants''' are substances applied to the body to affect [[body odor]] caused by [[bacteria]]l growth and the smell associated with bacterial breakdown of [[perspiration]] in armpits, feet and other areas of the body. A subgroup of deodorants, '''antiperspirants''', affect odor as well as prevent sweating by affecting [[sweat gland]]s. Antiperspirants are typically applied to the [[underarm]]s, while deodorants may also be used on feet and other areas in the form of [[body spray]]s. In the United States, deodorants are classified and regulated as [[cosmetics]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<!-- <ref name="fda-cosmetics"/> -->  Antiperspirants are classified as [[Over-the-counter drug|drugs]] by the FDA.<ref name="fda-cosmetics"/>

[[File:Stick deodorant.jpg|thumb|Stick antiperspirant/deodorant]]
Human perspiration is largely odorless until it is [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] by [[bacteria]] that thrive in hot, humid environments. The human underarm is among the most consistently warm areas on the surface of the human body, and [[sweat gland]]s provide moisture, which when excreted, has a vital cooling effect. When adult armpits are washed with [[alkaline]] pH soap, the skin loses its [[acid mantle]] (pH 4.5 - 6), raising the skin pH and disrupting the skin barrier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuehl BL, Fyfe KS, Shear NH |title=Cutaneous cleansers |journal=Skin Therapy Lett |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=1–4 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12858234}}</ref>  As many bacteria thrive in this elevated pH environment,<ref name="Stenzaly-Achtert"/> this makes the skin susceptible to bacterial colonization.<ref name="Stenzaly-Achtert">{{cite journal |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0846.2000.006002087.x |author=Stenzaly-Achtert S, Schölermann A, Schreiber J, Diec KH, Rippke F, Bielfeldt S |title=Axillary pH and influence of deodorants |journal=Skin Res Technol |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87–91 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=11428948}}</ref>  The bacteria feed on the sweat from the [[apocrine sweat gland|apocrine glands]] and on dead skin and hair cells, releasing [[trans-3-Methyl-2-hexenoic acid]] in their waste, which is the primary cause of body odor.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/20.4.401 |author=Pierce JD Jr, Zeng XN, Aronov EV, Preti G, Wysocki CJ |title=Cross-adaptation of sweaty-smelling 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid by a structurally similar, pleasant-smelling odorant |journal=Chem Senses |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=401–11 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=8590025}}</ref> [[Underarm hair]] wicks the moisture away from the skin and aids in keeping the skin dry enough to prevent or diminish bacterial colonization.

Deodorants are classified and regulated as [[cosmetics]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)<ref name="fda-cosmetics">[http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/CosmeticsQA/ucm136560.htm Cosmetics Q&A: "Personal Care Products"]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</ref> and are designed to eliminate odor. Deodorants are usually [[alcohol]]-based. Alcohol initially stimulates sweating, but may also temporarily kill bacteria.<ref name="eNotes">{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/antiperspirant-deodorant-stick |title=Antiperspirant/Deodorant Stick |work=eNotes}}</ref> Deodorants can be formulated with other, more persistent [[antimicrobial]]s such as [[triclosan]], or with metal [[chelant]] compounds that slow bacterial growth. Deodorants may contain [[perfume]] fragrances or natural [[essential oil]]s intended to mask the odor of perspiration.

Deodorants combined with antiperspirant agents are classified as [[drugs]] by the FDA.<ref name="fda-cosmetics"/> Antiperspirants attempt to stop or significantly reduce perspiration and thus reduce the moist climate in which bacteria thrive. [[Aluminium chloride]], [[aluminium chlorohydrate]], and [[aluminium]]-[[zirconium]] compounds, most notably [[aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly]] and [[aluminium zirconium trichlorohydrex gly]], are frequently used in antiperspirants. Aluminium chlorohydrate and aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrate gly are the most frequent active ingredients in commercial antiperspirants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lukacs VA, Korting HC |title=[Antiperspirants and deodorants--ingredients and evaluation] |language=German |journal=Dermatosen in Beruf Und Umwelt |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=53–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2656175}}</ref> Aluminium-based complexes react with the [[electrolyte]]s in the sweat to form a gel plug in the duct of the sweat gland. The plugs prevent the gland from excreting liquid and are removed over time by the natural [[Desquamation|sloughing]] of the skin. The metal salts work in another way to prevent sweat from reaching the surface of the skin: the  aluminium salts interact with the keratin fibrils in the sweat ducts and form a physical plug that prevents sweat from reaching the skin’s surface. Aluminium salts also have a slight [[astringent]] effect on the pores; causing them to contract, further preventing sweat from reaching the surface of the skin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Draelos ZD |title=Antiperspirants and the hyperhidrosis patient |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=220–224 |year=2001 |month=September |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8019.2001.01028.x}}</ref> The blockage of a large number of sweat glands reduces the amount of sweat produced in the underarms, though this may vary from person to person.

Over-the-counter products labeled as "natural deodorant crystal" containing the chemical [[potassium alum]] have gained new-found popularity as an alternative health product.<ref name="Gallego"/> A popular alternative to modern commercial deodorants is [[ammonium alum]], which is a common type of [[alum]] sold in crystal form and often referred to as a ''deodorant crystal''. It has been used as a deodorant throughout history in Thailand, the Far East, Mexico and other countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Deodorants and antiperspirants come in many forms. What is commonly used varies in different countries. In Europe, [[aerosol spray]]s are popular, as are cream and roll-on forms. In the United States, solid or gel forms are dominant.
