'''''The New England Journal of Medicine''''' ('''''NEJM''''') is an [[English language|English-language]] [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[public health journal|medical journal]] published by the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] and it is among the most prestigious in the world. It describes itself as the oldest continuously published medical journal in the world.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/05/health/the-doctor-s-world-editor-of-journal-envisions-new-directions-and-lighter-tone.html | work=The New York Times | title=THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; Editor of Journal Envisions New Directions and Lighter Tone | first1=Lawrence K. | last1=Altman | date=February 5, 1991}}</ref> The journal publishes [[editorial]]s, papers on original research, [[review article]]s, correspondence, and [[case report]]s, and has a special section called "Images in Clinical Medicine".

==History==
[[File:Nejm 01011814.jpg|left|thumb|January 1814 edition of the Journal.]]
In September 1811, [[John Collins Warren]], a Boston physician,<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Cary | first1 = John | title = Joseph Warren: Physician, Politician, Patriot | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 1961 | accessdate = 2011-12-22}}</ref> along with James Jackson, submitted a formal prospectus to establish the ''New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and Collateral Branches of Science'' as a medical and philosophical journal.<ref>{{cite news | title = | date = 1811-09-28 | work = Boston Patriot | accessdate = 2011-12-22}}</ref> Subsequently, the first issue of the ''New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and the Collateral Branches of Medical Science'' was published in January 1812.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nejm.org/toc/nejms/1/1 | title = January 1, 1812, table of contents for the New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and the Collateral Branches of Medical Science | accessdate = 2011-12-22}}</ref> The journal was published quarterly.

[[File:1823 intell.JPG|left|thumb|1823 Boston Medical Intelligencer.]]
On April 29, 1823, another publication, the ''Boston Medical Intelligencer'', appeared under the stewardship of [[Jerome V.C. Smith]].<ref name="countway.harvard.edu">{{cite web | url = https://www.countway.harvard.edu/chm/rarebooks/exhibits/BML_1805/bml_1805.htm | title = The Boston Medical Library: A reconstruction of the collection of 1805 and its history | accessdate = 2011-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Fitz-Gilbert Waters | first1 = Henry | title = The New England historical and genealogical register, Volume 48 | publisher = New England Historic Genealogical Society | year = 1961 | accessdate = 2011-12-22}}</ref> 

[[File:1828 bostmed.JPG|right|thumb|1828 Boston Medical and Surgical Journal.]]
The ''Intelligencer'' ran into financial troubles in the spring of 1827, and the editors of the ''New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and the Collateral Branches of Medical Science''  purchased it in February 1828 merging the two publications to form the ''Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'',<ref name="countway.harvard.edu"/> published weekly. 

The Massachusetts Medical Society purchased it in 1921 for $1<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nejm.org/page/about-nejm/history-and-mission | title = About NEJM: Past and Present | accessdate = 2011-12-22}}</ref> and renamed it in 1928 the ''New England Journal of Medicine''.

Notable articles from the course of the ''New England Journal of Medicine's'' history include:

*In November 1846, [[Henry Jacob Bigelow]], a Boston surgeon, reported a breakthrough in the search for surgical [[anesthetics]] with the first uses of inhaled ether in 1846. This allowed patients to remain sedated during operations ranging from [[dental extraction]] to [[amputation]].<ref name="Bigelow1846">{{cite journal|last1=Bigelow|first1=Henry Jacob|title=Insensibility during Surgical Operations Produced by Inhalation|journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal |volume=35|issue=16|year=1846|pages=309–317 |issn=0096-6762 |doi=10.1056/NEJM184611180351601}}</ref> "A patient has been rendered completely insensible during an amputation of the thigh, regain consciousness after a short interval," Bigelow wrote. "Other severe operations have been performed without the knowledge of the patients."
*In June 1906, [[James Homer Wright]] published an article that described how he stained and studied [[bone marrow]] with descriptions of what are now known as [[megakaryocytes]] and [[platelets]].<ref name="Wright1906">{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=James Homer|title=The Origin and Nature of the Blood Plates|journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal|volume=154|issue=23|year=1906|pages=643–645|issn=0096-6762|doi=10.1056/NEJM190606071542301}}</ref>
*In October 1872, a lecture by C.E. Brown-Sequard was published that proposed the then-revolutionary idea that one [[cerebral hemisphere]] can influence both sides of the body. The neurologist would go on to describe what is now known as the [[Brown-Sequard syndrome]].<ref name="Brown-SequardWebber1872">{{cite journal|last1=Brown-Sequard|first1=C. E.|last2=Webber|first2=S. G.|title=The Origin and Signification of the Symptoms of Brain Disease|journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal|volume=87|issue=16|year=1872|pages=261–263|issn=0096-6762|doi=10.1056/NEJM187210170871601}}</ref>
*In June 1948, [[Sidney Farber]] reported promising results in treatment of early childhood [[leukemia]]. Based on anecdotal evidence that children with acute leukemia worsened if they were given [[folic acid]], he worked on blocking folic acid metabolism. His team gave 16 infants and children with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] a folic acid inhibitor, [[aminopterin]] -– 10 showed improvement by clinical and hematologic parameters after three months.<ref name="FarberDiamond1948">{{cite journal|last1=Farber|first1=Sidney|last2=Diamond|first2=Louis K.|last3=Mercer|first3=Robert D.|last4=Sylvester|first4=Robert F.|last5=Wolff|first5=James A.|title=Temporary Remissions in Acute Leukemia in Children Produced by Folic Acid Antagonist, 4-Aminopteroyl-Glutamic Acid (Aminopterin)|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=238|issue=23|year=1948|pages=787–793|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM194806032382301|pmid=18860765}}</ref> In his article, Farber advised receiving the results cautiously: "It is again emphasized that these remissions are temporary in character and that the substance is toxic and may be productive of even greater disturbances than have been encountered so far in our studies," he wrote. "No evidence has been mentioned in this report that would justify the suggestion of the term 'cure' of acute leukemia in children."
*In November 1952, cardiologist [[Paul Zoll]] published an early report on resuscitation of the heart. "The purpose of this report is to describe the successful use in 2 patients of a quick, simple, effective and safe method of arousing the heart from ventricular standstill by an artificial, external, electric pacemaker," he wrote. "For the first time it was possible to keep a patient alive during [[ventricular asystole]] lasting for hours to days. This procedure may prove valuable in many clinical situations."<ref name="Brown-SequardWebber1872"/>
*In February 1973, NEJM published the first report of polyp removal using a [[colonoscope]] and introduced a procedure during screening to reduce cancer risk. The authors reported on 218 patients, from whom they removed 303 polyps (at one or more procedures per patient).<ref name="WolffShinya1973">{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=William I.|last2=Shinya|first2=Hiromi|title=Polypectomy Via the Fiberoptic Colonoscope|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=288|issue=7|year=1973|pages=329–332|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM197302152880701}}</ref>
*In December 1981, two landmark articles<ref name="GottliebSchroff1981">{{cite journal|last1=Gottlieb|first1=Michael S.|last2=Schroff|first2=Robert|last3=Schanker|first3=Howard M.|last4=Weisman|first4=Joel D.|last5=Fan|first5=Peng Thim|last6=Wolf|first6=Robert A.|last7=Saxon|first7=Andrew|title=Pneumocystis cariniiPneumonia and Mucosal Candidiasis in Previously Healthy Homosexual Men|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=305|issue=24|year=1981|pages=1425–1431|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM198112103052401|pmid=6272109}}</ref><ref name="MasurMichelis1981">{{cite journal|last1=Masur|first1=Henry|last2=Michelis|first2=Mary Ann|last3=Greene|first3=Jeffrey B.|last4=Onorato|first4=Ida|last5=Vande Stouwe|first5=Robert A.|last6=Holzman|first6=Robert S.|last7=Wormser|first7=Gary|last8=Brettman|first8=Lee|last9=Lange|first9=Michael|last10=Murray|first10=Henry W.|last11=Cunningham-Rundles|first11=Susanna|title=An Outbreak of Community-AcquiredPneumocystis cariniiPneumonia|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=305|issue=24|year=1981|pages=1431–1438|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM198112103052402|pmid=6975437}}</ref> described the clinical course of four patients -– first reported in the CDC's June 1981 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report—with the disease that would come to be known as [[AIDS]].
*In April 2001, Druker et al. reported a targeted therapy for [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]]. Based on the knowledge that BCR-ABL, a constitutively activated [[tyrosine kinase]], causes CML, the authors tested with success an inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase in patients who had failed first-line therapy. The finding helped begin the era of designing cancer drugs to target specific molecular abnormalities.<ref name="DrukerTalpaz2001">{{cite journal|last1=Druker|first1=Brian J.|last2=Talpaz|first2=Moshe|last3=Resta|first3=Debra J.|last4=Peng|first4=Bin|last5=Buchdunger|first5=Elisabeth|last6=Ford|first6=John M.|last7=Lydon|first7=Nicholas B.|last8=Kantarjian|first8=Hagop|last9=Capdeville|first9=Renaud|last10=Ohno-Jones|first10=Sayuri|last11=Sawyers|first11=Charles L.|title=Efficacy and Safety of a Specific Inhibitor of the BCR-ABL Tyrosine Kinase in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=344|issue=14|year=2001|pages=1031–1037|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM200104053441401|pmid=11287972}}</ref>

== Website ==

On April 25, 1996, NEJM announced their new website, which published each week the abstracts for research articles and the full text of editorials, cases, and letters to the editor. After print publishing for 184 years this was the NEJM's first use of the Internet for electronic publication.<ref name="Campion1996">{{cite journal|last1=Campion|first1=Edward W.|title=TheJournal's New Presence on the Internet|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=334|issue=17|year=1996|pages=1129–1129|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM199604253341712}}</ref>

The website was launched several months earlier in 1996, but the editors wanted proof that weekly electronic publication would work. Only then was an announcement approved for publication on the editorial page. Two years later, online publication extended to include the full text of all articles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://nejm200.nejm.org/timeline/milestone/1750 | title = First NEJM website | accessdate = 2012-05-07}}</ref>

Since its launch, NEJM has added to its website:
* Videos in Clinical Medicine, peer-reviewed educational videos to teach procedures requiring skilled techniques and specialized physical examination.<ref name="McMahonIngelfinger2006">{{cite journal|last1=McMahon|first1=Graham T.|last2=Ingelfinger|first2=Julie R.|last3=Campion|first3=Edward W.|title=Videos in Clinical Medicine — A New Journal Feature|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|year=2006|pages=1635–1635|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMe068044}}</ref>
* Interactive Medical Cases, which mimic a clinical encounter by presenting the patient's history with results of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests.

==Influence==
The website for the [[George Polk Awards]] noted that its 1977 award to the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' "provided the first significant mainstream visibility for a publication that would achieve enormous attention and prestige in the ensuing decades."<ref>[http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/history.html The George Polk Awards for Journalism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The journal usually has the highest [[impact factor]] of the journals of [[medicine|clinical medicine]] (including the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', and ''[[The Lancet]]''); in 2006, the impact factor was 51, according to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the first research journal to break 50.{{Nonspecific|date=September 2010}}{{Full|date=November 2012}}

==Ingelfinger rule==

''The New England Journal of Medicine'' requires that articles it publishes not have been published or released elsewhere. Referred to as the [[Ingelfinger rule]], this policy protects the originality of content. 

The rule was first described in a 1969 editorial by Franz Ingelfinger, the editor-in-chief at that time.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Definition of Sole Contribution |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=281 |issue=12 |year=1969 |pages=676–677 |issn=0028-4793 |doi=10.1056/NEJM196909182811208}}</ref> Most medical journals have similar rules in place.

==Vioxx correction controversy==
{{See also|Vioxx#VIGOR study and publishing controversy|label 1=VIGOR study and publishing controversy}}
In the early 2000s, the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' was involved in a controversy around problems with research on the drug [[Rofecoxib|Vioxx]]. A study was published in the journal in November 2000 which noted an increase in [[myocardial infarction]] amongst those taking Vioxx.<ref>{{citation | author= Bombardier C, Laine L, Reicin A, Shapiro D, Burgos-Vargas R, Davis B, Day R, Ferraz MB, Hawkey CJ, Hochberg MC, Kvien TK, Schnitzer TJ; VIGOR Study Group | year=2000 | title= Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | volume=343 | issue=21 | pages=1520–1528 | pmid=11087881 | doi=10.1056/NEJM200011233432103}}.</ref> According to [[Richard Smith (editor)|Richard Smith]], the former editor of the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'', concerns about the correctness of that study were raised with the journal's editor, [[Jeffrey M. Drazen|Jeff Drazen]], as early as August 2001. That year, both the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' also cast doubt on the validity of the data interpretation that had been published in the ''NEJM''.<ref name="BMJ">{{cite journal |pmc=1502213 |title =NEJM "failed its readers" by delay in publishing its concerns about VIGOR trial |first =Roger |last=Dobson |date=July 15, 2006 |pmid=16840463 |doi=10.1136/bmj.333.7559.116-f |volume=333 |issue=7559 |journal=BMJ |pages=116}}</ref> [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] withdrew the drug from market in September 2004. In December 2005, ''NEJM'' published an expression of concern about the original study following discovery that the authors knew more about certain adverse events than they disclosed at the time of publication. From the Expression of Concern: "Until the end of November 2005, we believed that these were late events that were not known to the authors in time to be included in the article published in the Journal on November 23, 2000. It now appears, however, from a memorandum dated July 5, 2000, that was obtained by subpoena in the Vioxx litigation and made available to the Journal, that at least two of the authors knew about the three additional myocardial infarctions at least two weeks before the authors submitted the first of two revisions and 4 1/2 months before publication of the article."<ref name="NEJM">{{cite web |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe058314 |title=Expression of Concern: Bombardier et al., "Comparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib and Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis," N Engl J Med 2000;343:1520-8. |first =Gregory |last=Curfman |accessdate =May 13, 2011 |date=December 29, 2005}}</ref> During the five-year period between publication and Expression of Concern, it has been estimated that Merck paid ''NEJM'' as much as US$836,000 for article reprints that Merck used for promotional purposes.<ref>Trudo Lemmens & Ron A.
