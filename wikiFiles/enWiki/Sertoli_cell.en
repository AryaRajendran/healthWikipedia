A '''Sertoli cell''' (a kind of [[sustentacular cell]]) is a 'nurse' [[cell (biology)|cell]] of the [[testicle|testes]] that is part of a [[seminiferous tubule]]. 

It is activated by [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and has [[FSH-receptor]] on its membranes. It is specifically located in the convoluted seminiferous tubules (since this is the only place in the testes where the spermatozoa are produced).

==Functions==

Because its main function is to nourish the developing sperm cells through the stages of [[spermatogenesis]], the Sertoli cell has also been called the "mother" or "nurse" cell. Sertoli cells also act as phagocytes, consuming the residual cytoplasm during spermatogenesis. Translocation of germ cells from the base to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules occurs by conformational changes in the lateral margins of the Sertoli cells.

===Secretory===
Sertoli cells secrete the following substances: 

* [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] (AMH) - secreted during the early stages of [[fetus|fetal]] life.

* [[inhibin]] and [[activin]]s - secreted after puberty, and work together to regulate [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] secretion

* [[androgen binding protein]] (also called testosterone binding globulin) - increases testosterone concentration in the seminiferous tubules to stimulate spermatogenesis

* [[estradiol]] - [[aromatase]] from Sertoli cells convert [[testosterone]] to 17 beta estradiol to direct [[spermatogenesis]]

* [[glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor]] (GDNF) - has been demonstrated to function in promoting undifferentiating spermatogonia, which ensures stem cell self-renewal during the perinatal period.

* the Ets related molecule ([[ERM transcription factor]]) - needed for maintenance of the spermatogonial stem cell in the adult testis.

* [[transferrin]] - a blood plasma protein for iron ion delivery <ref>{{cite journal | author = Xiong X, Wang A, Liu G, Liu H, Wang C, Xia T, Chen X, Yang K | title = Effects of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene on the expressions of transferrin and androgen-binding protein in rat Sertoli cells | journal = Environ Res | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 334–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16380112 | doi = 10.1016/j.envres.2005.11.003}}</ref>

===Structural===
The tight junctions of Sertoli cells form the [[blood-testis barrier]], a structure that partitions the interstitial [[blood]] compartment of the testis from the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules.  Because of the [[apical (anatomy)|apical]] progression of the spermatogonia, the tight junctions must be dynamically reformed and broken to allow the immunoidentical [[spermatogonia]] to cross through the blood-testis barrier so they can become immunologically unique.  Sertoli cells control the entry and exit of [[nutrient]]s, [[hormone]]s and other chemicals into the tubules of the testis as well as make the adluminal compartment an immune-privileged site. 

The cell is also responsible for establishing and maintaining the spermatogonial [[stem cell]] niche, which ensures the renewal of stem cells and the differentiation of [[Spermatogonium|spermatogonia]] into mature germ cells that progress stepwise through the long process of spermatogenesis, ending in the release of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]. Sertoli cells bind to spermatogonial cells via N-cadherins and galctosyltransferase (via carbohydrate residues).

===Other functions===
During the [[Spermiogenesis#Maturation phase|maturation phase of spermiogenesis]], the Sertoli cells consume the unneeded portions of the spermatozoa.

==Production of Sertoli cells==
Sertoli cells are required for male sexual development. During male development, the gene [[SRY]] activates [[SOX9]], which then activates and forms a feedforward loop with [[FGF9]]. Sertoli cell [[proliferation]] and [[differentiation]] is mainly activated by FGF9.<ref>{{cite pmid | 16700629}}</ref> The absence of FGF9 tends to cause a female to develop <ref name="Moniot">{{cite journal | last=Moniot | first=Brigitte | last2=Declosmenil | first2=Faustine | last3=Barrionuevo | first3=Francisco | last4=Scherer | first4=Gerd | last5=Aritake | first5=Kosuke | last6=Malki | first6=Safia | last7=Marzi | first7=Laetitia | last8=Cohen-Solal | first8=Ann | last9=Georg | first9=Ina | last10=Klattig | first10=Jürgen | last11=Englert | first11=Christoph | last12=Kim | first12=Yuna | last13=Capel | first13=Blanche | last14=Eguchi | first14=Naomi | last15=Urade | first15=Yoshihiro | last16=Boizet-Bonhoure | first16=Brigitte | last17=Poulat | first17=Francis | year=2009 | title=The PGD2 pathway, independently of FGF9, amplifies SOX9 activity in Sertoli cells during male sexual differentiation| journal=Development| volume=136| issue=11| pages=1813–1821| publisher=The Company of Biologists Ltd. | pmid=19429785 | doi=10.1242/dev.032631}}</ref>

Once fully differentiated, the Sertoli cell is unable to proliferate. Therefore, once spermatogenesis has begun, no more Sertoli cells are created. 

Recently however, some scientists have found a way to grow these cells outside of the body. This gives rise to the possibility of repairing some defects that cause male infertility.

It has been suggested that they may derive from [[mesonephros]].<ref name="VizeWoolf2003">{{cite book|author1=Peter D. Vize|author2=Adrian S.

==Nomenclature==
Sertoli cells are called so because of their [[eponym]] [[Enrico Sertoli]], an Italian physiologist who discovered them while studying medicine in the University of Pavia, Italy.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|518}}</ref>

He published a description of this cell in 1865. The cell was discovered by Sertoli with a Belthle microscope purchased in 1862, which he used while studying medicine. 

In the 1865 publication, his first description used the terms "tree-like cell" or "stringy cell" and most importantly he referred to these "mother cells." It was other scientists who used Enrico's family name, Sertoli, to label these cell in publications, starting in 1888. As of 2006, two textbooks that are devoted specifically to the Sertoli cell have been published.

==Histology==
On slides, using standard staining, it can be easy to confuse the Sertoli cells with the other cells of the germinal epithelium. The most distinctive feature of the Sertoli cells is the dark [[nucleolus]].<ref>[http://www.cvm.okstate.edu/instruction/mm_curr/histology/MR/HiMRP4.htm OSU Center for Veterinary Health Sciences - OSU-CVHS Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Pathology==
[[Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour]] are part of the [[sex cord-stromal tumour]] group of [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian neoplasm]]s.
