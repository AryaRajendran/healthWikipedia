'''Plexopathy''' is a disorder affecting a [[wikt:network|network]] of [[nerves]], [[blood vessels]], or [[lymph vessels]].<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=44504 Plexopathy] entry in the public domain NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms</ref> The region of nerves it affects are at the brachial or lumbosacral plexus. Symptoms include pain, loss of motor control, and sensory deficits. <ref name="HN"/>

There are two main types of plexopathy; [[Brachial plexopathy]] and Lumbosacral Plexopathy. They are usually caused from some sort of localized [[Physical trauma|trauma]] such as a [[dislocated shoulder]]. The disorder can also be caused secondary to a compression, co-morbid [[vascular disease]], [[infection]], or may be [[idiopathic]] with an unknown cause. <ref name="HN">{{cite book|title=Harwood-Nuss' Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine|editor=Allan B.

==Evaluation and management==
The first steps in the evaluation and later management of plexopathy would consist of gathering a  [[medical history]] and conducting a [[physical examination]] by a healthcare clinician. Motor function defect patterns detected within either the upper or lower extremities help with [[diagnosis]] of the disorder. <ref name="HN"/>

[[X-rays]] of the cervical spine, chest, and shoulder are usually ordered if symptoms point to acute lumbosacral plexopathy. If the physical history reveals a history of [[diabetes]], [[collagen vascular disease]], or [[symptoms]] of [[infection]], the physician may order a series of blood tests including a [[complete blood count]] (CBC) and a [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP). <ref name="HN"/>

==Treatment==
Mild cases are usually treated by the administration of [[analgesia]] and [[muscle relaxers]]. Reduced and limited physical activity with repeated follow-ups with the health care provider are required for one diagnosed with plexopathy. Individuals with prolonged, chronic symptoms will require additional testing and treatment. <ref name=HN/> With brachial plexopathy, surgical decompression may be warranted if the pathophysiology of the disease is causing pressure on the affected nerves. "In some cases, no treatment is required and recovery happens on its own." <ref name="NYtimes">{{cite news|url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/brachial-plexopathy/overview.html|title=Brachial Plexopathy|date=2009-12-09|work=Health Guide|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref> Treatment for lumbosacral plexopathy that is not cause by trauma, but instead from [[diabetic plexopathy]], is directed at controlling the person's blood sugar level. By preventing the deterioration of the nerve fibers from [[hyperglycemia]], patients may recover significant muscle strength. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3841/is_199903/ai_n8843305/|title=Lumbosacral Plexopathies: Diagnosis and rehabilitation|work=BNET|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=10 December 2009 | year=1999}}</ref>

==Disposition==
Plexopathy symptoms often resemble [[spinal cord]] disorders. <ref>{{cite book|last=Dyck|first=PJ|coauthors=Thomas, PK|title=Peripheral Neuropathy|publisher=WB Sanders|location=Philadelphia|year=1993|edition=3rd}}</ref> A neurosurgical consultation is usually undertaken to insure proper diagnosis, management, and treatment. Patients with chronic symptoms will likely be advised to follow-up with outpatient care from either their health care provider or specialist. <ref name=HN/>
