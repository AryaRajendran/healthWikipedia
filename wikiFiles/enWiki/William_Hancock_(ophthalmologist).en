In 1896 he qualified as a surgeon, gaining the dual qualifications [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|M.R.C.S]] and [[Royal College of Physicians|L.R.C.P.]].  He became a [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]] two years later in 1898.

==Sporting career==
Hancock played one [[First-class cricket|first-class]] cricket match for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in 1892.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/3/3596/3596.html |title=Player Profile: William Hancock |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-11-06}}</ref>  He also represented his county at [[tennis]], and in his ''British Medical Journal'' obituary it is claimed that he would have gained international honours in rugby had it not been for a knee injury.<ref name="bmjobit"/>

His brother [[Froude Hancock|Philip Froude Hancock]] made ten international appearances in international rugby for England and Britain, and another, [[Frank Hancock]] captained Wales in the same sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiveliscomberugby.co.uk/History.htm |title=Club History |publisher=Wiveliscombe R.F.C |accessdate=2010-11-06}}</ref>  Of the ten brothers, seven, including William, played rugby union for Somerset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiveliscombe.com/a_short_history/ |title=A Short History |publisher=Wiveliscombe Parish Council |date=2005-06-15 |accessdate=2010-11-06}}</ref> His nephew, Frank Hancock's son [[Ralph Hancock (cricketer)|Ralph]], played cricket for Somerset in nine matches between 1907 and 1914.

==Personal life and death==
Hancock married Margaret Hay Sweet Escott in 1899 and the couple had four children. He suffered from abdominal pain for 18 months, which in December 1909 became worse and he was forced to rest in bed for four weeks. Initially the symptoms appeared to have faded, but the acute pain returned, and Hancock required an operation for [[appendicitis]]. The operation was successful, and Hancock was making a good recovery until four days later.  He died of [[pulmonary embolism]] and [[thrombosis]] the following day.<ref name="bmjobit"/>
