'''[[Multiple sclerosis]]''' is a condition in which the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] of a person present a special kind of distributed lesions (sclerosis) whose pathophysiology is complex and still under investigation. It is considered a '''pathological entity''' by some authors<ref name="brain.oxfordjournals.org">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp342 | title = Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis | year = 2010 | author = Lassmann H | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 317 }}</ref> and a '''clinical entity''' by some others.<ref name="pmid11456302">{{cite journal |author=McDonald WI, Compston A, Edan G, ''et al.'' |title=Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis |url=http://www.msdiagnosed.org/McDonald.pdf|journal=[[Ann.

A protein called Interleukin 12 is responsible for the differentiation of naive T cells into inflammatory T cells.

MS symptoms develop as the cumulative result of multiple [[lesion]]s in the brain and [[spinal cord]]. This is why symptoms can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where their lesions occur.

Repair processes, called remyelination, also play an important role in MS. Remyelination is one of the reasons why, especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms tend to decrease or disappear temporarily. Nevertheless, nerve damage and irreversible loss of neurons occur early in MS.

The [[oligodendrocyte]]s that originally formed a [[myelin sheath]] cannot completely rebuild a destroyed myelin sheath. However, the central nervous system can recruit oligodendrocyte [[stem cell]]s capable of proliferation and migration and differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The newly-formed myelin sheaths are thinner and often not as effective as the original ones. Repeated attacks lead to successively fewer effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. Under laboratory conditions, stem cells are quite capable of proliferating and differentiating into remyelinating oligodendrocytes; it is therefore suspected that inflammatory conditions or axonal damage somehow inhibit stem cell proliferation and differentiation in affected areas<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolswijk G |title=Chronic stage multiple sclerosis lesions contain a relatively quiescent population of oligodendrocyte precursor cells |journal=J Neurosci. |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=601–9 |date=15 January 1998|pmid=9425002 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9425002 }}</ref>

===Brain lesions distribution===

Due to the distribution of the lesions, since 1916 they are also known as [[Dawson's fingers]].<ref>[http://radiopaedia.org/articles/dawson-fingers Dawson fingers, at Radiopedia]</ref> They appear around the brain blood vessels.

===Spinal cord damage===

Cervical spinal cord has been found to be affected by MS even without attacks, and damage correlates with disability.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Agosta F, Pagani E, Caputo D, Filippi M |title=Associations between cervical cord gray matter damage and disability in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=Arch.

Progressive tissue loss and injury occur in the cervical cord of MS patients. These two components of cord damage are not interrelated, suggesting that a multiparametric MRI approach is needed to get estimates of such a damage. MS cord pathology is independent of brain changes, develops at different rates according to disease phenotype, and is associated to medium-term disability accrual.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Agosta F, Absinta M, Sormani MP, ''et al.'' |title=In vivo assessment of cervical cord damage in MS patients: a longitudinal diffusion tensor MRI study |journal=Brain |volume=130 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=2211–9 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17535835 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm110 }}</ref>

Spinal cord presents grey matter lesions, that can be confirmed post-mortem and by high field MR imaging. Spinal cord grey matter lesions may be detected on MRI more readily than GM lesions in the brain, making the cord a promising site to study the grey matter demyelination.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilmore C, Geurts J, Evangelou N, ''et al.'' |title=Spinal cord grey matter lesions in multiple sclerosis detected by post-mortem high field MR imaging |journal=Multiple Sclerosis |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18845658 |doi=10.1177/1352458508096876 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=180–8 }}</ref>

===Retina and optic nerve damage===

The Retina and the [[optic nerve]] originate as outgrowths of the [[brain]] during embryonic development, so the retina is considered part of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).<ref>"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]</ref> It is the only part of the CNS that can be imaged non-invasively in the living organism.

===Peripheral nervous system involvement===

Though MS is defined as a CNS condition, some reports link problems in the peripheral nervous system with the presence of MS plaques in the CNS<ref>Charles M. Poser, The peripheral nervous system in multiple sclerosis: A review and pathogenetic hypothesis, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-510X(87)90262-0</ref>

===Lesion structure===
[[Image:Demyelination.svg|thumb|200|Layers of a lesion]]

[[Multiple sclerosis]] is a condition defined by the presence of a special kind of lesions in the brain and spinal cord.<ref name="pmid11456302" /> Therefore it is very important to establish what those "lesions typical of MS" are. They mainly consist in [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]] and scarring in the fatty [[myelin]] sheaths around the [[axon]]s of the brain and spinal cord.<ref name="pmid18970977">{{cite journal

* '''[[#Normal appearing White Matter|NAWM]] border with the lesion:''' These areas contained activated [[microglia]], antibodies binding to [[astrocytes]], axons, [[oligodendrocytes]] and [[dendritic cells]] along blood vessels. No T or B cells are present.
* '''Lesion external layer:''' Number of oligodendrocyte cell bodies decreases. Remaining oligodendrocytes are sometimes swollen or dying. Myelin sheaths are still intact but swollen. Small increase in microglia and T cells.
* '''Active layer:''' [[Phagocytic]] demyelinating areas: There is myelin debris taken up by local microglia and [[phagocytes]] entering from the bloodstream. More T cells in these areas, and in the space adjacent to blood vessels.
* '''Recently demyelinated tissue:''' Tissues were full of myelin-containing phagocytes. Signs of early remyelination together with small numbers of oligodendrocytes. Large numbers of T cells, B cells, and other immune cells concentrated around blood vessels.
* '''Inactive layer:''' Again activated microglia and dendritic cells were also found around blood vessels.

===Lesions under MRI===

Most MS lesions are isointense to white matter (they appear bright) on T1-weighted MRI, but some are "hypointense" (lower intensity). These are called "black holes" (BH). They appear specially in the supratentorial region of the brain. 

When BH's appear, around half of them revert in a month. This is considered a sign of remyelination. When they remain, this is regarded as a sign of permanent demyelination and axonal loss. This has been shown on post-mortem autopsies.<ref>van Walderveen MA; Kamphorst W; Scheltens P; van Waesberghe JH; Ravid R; Valk J; Polman CH; Barkhof F, Histopathologic correlate of hypointense lesions on T1-weighted spin-echo MRI in multiple sclerosis. [http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/abstract.do?topicKey=demyelin/4438&refNum=38]</ref>

Small lesions are invisible under MRI. Therefore clinically assisted [[McDonald criteria|diagnostic criteria]] are still required for a more accurate MS diagnosis than MRI alone.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2156195 | volume=109 | issue=1–2 | title=Identification of two types of excitatory monosynaptic inputs in frog spinal motoneurones | year=1990 | month=February | author=Antonov SM, Kalinina NI, Kurchavyj GG, Magazanik LG, Shupliakov OV, Vesselkin NP | pages=82–7 | journal = Neuroscience letters | doi=10.1016/0304-3940(90)90541-G}}</ref>

The '''lesion evolution under MRI''' has been reported to begin as a pattern of central hyperintensity. This was seen in the majority of new lesions, both on proton density and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.<ref>Charles R. G. Guttmann, Sungkee S. Ahn, Liangge Hsu, Ron Kikinis, and Ferenc A.

Whatever the demyelination process is, currently it is possible to detect lesions before demyelination, and they show clusters of activated microglia and leukocyte infiltration, together with oligodendrocytes abnormalities<ref name=vanderValk09/>

==Blood–brain barrier disruption==

The [[blood–brain barrier]] ('''BBB''') is a protective barrier that denies the entrance of foreign material into the nervous system. BBB disruption is the moment in which penetration of the barrier by lymphocytes occur and has been considered one of the early problems in MS lesions.<ref>Alireza Minagar and J Steven Alexander, Blood–brain barrier disruption in multiple sclerosis [http://www.direct-ms.org/sites/default/files/Minagar%20BBB%20disruption%2003.pdf]</ref>

The BBB is composed of [[endothelial cell]]s which line the [[blood vessel]] walls of the central nervous system. Compared to normal endothelial cells, the cells lining the BBB are connected by [[occludin]] and [[claudin]] which form [[tight junction]]s in order to create a barrier to keep out larger molecules such as proteins. In order to pass through, molecules must be taken in by [[transport protein]]s or an alteration in the BBB permeability must occur, such as interactions with associated [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor proteins]] like ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3.<ref name="Correale 2006 148">{{cite journal|last=Correale|first=Jorge|coauthors=Andrés Villa|title=The blood–brain-barrier in multiple sclerosis: Functional roles and  therapeutic targeting|journal=Autoimmunity|date=24|year=2006|month=July|volume=40|issue=2|page=148|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> The BBB is compromised due to active recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and their migration across the barrier. Release of [[chemokine]]s allow for the activation of [[Cell adhesion molecule|adhesion molecules]] on the lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in an interaction with the endothelial cells of the BBB which then activate the expression of [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s to degrade the barrier.<ref name="Correale 2006 148"/> This results in disruption of the BBB, causing an increase in barrier permeability due to the degradation of tight junctions which maintain barrier integrity. Inducing the formation of tight junctions can restore BBB integrity and reduces its permeability, which can be used to reduce the damage caused by lymphocyte and monocyte migration across the barrier as restored integrity would restrict their movement.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cristante|first=Enrico|coauthors=Simon McArthur, Claudio Mauro, Elisa Maggiolo, Ignacio A. Romero, Marzena Wylezinska-Arridge, Pierre O. Couraud, Jordi Lopez-Tremoleda, Helen C. Christian, Babette B. Weksler, Andrea Malaspina, Egle Solito|title=Identification of an essential endogenous regulator  of blood–brain barrier integrity, and its pathological  and therapeutic implications|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States|date=15|year=2013|month=January|volume=110|issue=3|page=832|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1209362110|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>  

After barrier breakdown symptoms may appear, such as [[edema|swelling]]. Activation of [[macrophages]] and lymphocytes and their migration across the barrier may result in direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Prat|first=Elisabetta|coauthors=Roland Martin|title=The immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|year=2002|month=March/April|volume=39|issue=2|page=187|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> After demyelination has occurred, the degraded myelin sheath components, such as [[myelin basic protein]]s and [[Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein]]s, are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of [[protein]]s such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity.<ref name="Gray E, Thomas TL, Betmouni S, Scolding N, Love S 2008 888–99">{{cite journal |author=Gray E, Thomas TL, Betmouni S, Scolding N, Love S |title=Elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 and degradation of perineuronal nets in cerebrocortical multiple sclerosis plaques |journal=J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=888–99 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18716555 |doi=10.1097/NEN.0b013e318183d003 }}</ref>

===Postmortem BBB study===

Postmortem studies of the BBB, specially the vascular endotelium, show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1.<ref>Washington R, Burton J, Todd RF 3rd, Newman W, Dragovic L, Dore-Duffy P.

=== In vivo BBB study===

As lesions appear (using [[MRI]]) in "Normal-appearing white matter" (NAWM), the cause that finally triggers the BBB disruption is supposed to be there.<ref name="Werring DJ, Brassat D, Droogan AG, et al. 2000 1667–76">{{cite journal |author=Werring DJ, Brassat D, Droogan AG, ''et al.'' |title=The pathogenesis of lesions and normal-appearing white matter changes in multiple sclerosis: a serial diffusion MRI study |journal=Brain |volume=123 |pages=1667–76 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10908196 |doi= 10.1093/brain/123.8.1667|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10908196 |issue=8}}</ref> The damaged white matter is known as "Normal-appearing white matter" (NAWM) and is where lesions appear.<ref name="Goodkin DE, Rooney WD, Sloan R, et al. 1998 1689–97"/> These lesions form in NAWM before blood–brain barrier breakdown.<ref name=pmid11603615>{{cite journal |title=Pathological abnormalities in the normal-appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis |year=2001 |author=Allen et al. |journal=Neurol Sci  |pmid=11603615 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=141–4 |doi=10.1007/s100720170012 |last2=McQuaid |first2=S |last3=Mirakhur |first3=M |last4=Nevin |first4=G}}</ref>

==Damage before BBB disruption==

===Special MRI methods===
Before BBB disruption, brain tissues present normal aspect under normal MRI (Normal appearing [[white matter]], NAWM and normal appearing [[grey matter]], NAGM), but show several abnormalities under special MRI technologies:

[[Magnetization transfer]] [[Relaxation (NMR)|multi-echo T(2) relaxation]].

[[Diffusion MRI|Diffusion tensor MRI]] or [[Magnetization transfer|Magnetic Transfer]] MRI are two options to enhance MRI-hidden abnormalities discovery.

Several findings in these areas have been shown. Post-mortem studies over NAWM and NAGM areas (Normal appearing White and Gray Matters) show several biochemical alterations, like increased protein [[carbonylation]] and high levels of [[Glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP), which in NAGM areas comes together with higher than normal concentration of protein [[carbonyl]]s, suggesting reduced levels of antioxidants and the presence of small lesions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bizzozero OA, DeJesus G, Callahan K, Pastuszyn A. |title=Elevated protein carbonylation in the brain white matter and gray matter of patients with multiple sclerosis |journal= Journal of neuroscience research|volume= 81|issue= 5|pages= 687–95|year= 2005|pmid=16007681 |doi=10.1002/jnr.20587}}</ref> The amount of interneuronal [[Parvalbumin]] is lower than normal in brain's motor cortex areas,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clements RJ, McDonough J, Freeman EJ. |title=Distribution of parvalbumin and calretinin immunoreactive interneurons in motor cortex from multiple sclerosis post-mortem tissue |journal= Experimental brain research.

====Normal appearing White Matter====

The white matter with hidden but MRI-visible damage is known as "Normal-appearing white matter" (NAWM) and is where lesions appear.<ref name="Goodkin DE, Rooney WD, Sloan R, et al. 1998 1689–97"/> It has been shown that a steady and moderate increase of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can precede the development of new plaques and be followed by a rapid and marked increase at the time of Gadolinium enhancement and a slower decay after the cessation of enhancement.<ref>Werring DJ, Brassat D, Droogan AG, Clark CA, Symms MR, Barker GJ, MacManus DG, Thompson AJ, Miller DH., The pathogenesis of lesions and normal-appearing white matter changes in multiple sclerosis: a serial diffusion MRI study, NMR Research Unit, Queen Square, London, UK.</ref>

BBB disruption takes place on NAWM areas.<ref name="Werring DJ, Brassat D, Droogan AG, et al. 2000 1667–76"/> This can be read in different ways. Maybe some hidden changes in White Matter structure trigger the BBB disruption, or maybe the same process that creates the NAWM areas disrupts the BBB after some time.

Pre-active lesions are lesions in an early stage of development. They resolve sometimes without further damage, and not always develop into demyelinating lesions.<ref name=vanderValk09/> They present clusters of activated microglia in otherwise normal-appearing white matter. 

[[Oligodendrocyte]] abnormalities appear to be crucially involved.<ref name=pmid11603615/><ref>{{cite journal |

NAWM shows a decreased [[perfusion]] which does not appear to be secondary to axonal loss.<ref name="Keyser"/> The reduced perfusion of the NAWM in MS might be caused by a widespread [[astrocyte]] dysfunction, possibly related to a deficiency in astrocytic beta(2)-adrenergic receptors and a reduced formation of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], resulting in a reduced uptake of K(+) at the [[nodes of Ranvier]] and a reduced release of K(+) in the perivascular spaces.<ref>{{cite journal |author=De Keyser J, Steen C, Mostert JP, Koch MW. |title=Hypoperfusion of the cerebral white matter in multiple sclerosis: possible mechanisms and pathophysiological significance |journal= Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism |volume= 28|issue= 10|pages= 1645–51|year=2008 |pmid=18594554 |doi=10.1038/jcbfm.2008.72}}</ref> This would be consistent again with cases of [[Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]].

====Dirty appearing white matter====

Dirty-appearing white matter (referred to as DAWM like the former case) is defined as a region with ill-defined borders of intermediate
signal intensity between that of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and that of plaque on T2-weighted and proton density imaging.<ref>G. R. W. Moore, C. Laule, A. MacKay, E. Leung, D. K. B. Li, G. Zhao, A. L. Traboulsee, D. W. Paty , Dirty-appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis, Journal of Neurology. 04/2012; 255(11):1802-1811. DOI:10.1007/s00415-008-0002-z</ref> It is probably created by loss of myelin phospholipids, detected by the short T2 component, and axonal reduction.

==Origin of the normal-appearing tissues==

The cause why the normal appearing areas appear in the brain is unknown. Historically, several theories about how this happens has been presented.

===Old blood flow theories===

Venous pathology has been associated with MS for more than a century. Pathologist [[Georg Eduard Rindfleisch]] noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around veins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lassmann H |date=July 2005 |title=Multiple sclerosis pathology: evolution of pathogenetic concepts |journal=[[Brain Pathology]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=217–22 |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.2005.tb00523.x |pmid=16196388 }}{{vn|date=September 2010}}</ref>  Some other authors like [[Tracy Putnam]]<ref>Putnam, T.J. (1937) Evidence of vascular occlusion in multiple sclerosis</ref> pointed to venous obstructions.

Some authors like [[Franz Schelling]] proposed a mechanical damage procedure based on violent blood reflux.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 3641027 | last1 = Schelling  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | first1 = F | title = Damaging venous reflux into the skull or spine: relevance to multiple sclerosis | journal = Medical hypotheses| volume=21 | issue=2 | year=1986 | month=October | pages=141–8 | doi = 10.1016/0306-9877(86)90003-4}}</ref> Later the focus moved to softer hemodynamic abnormalities, which were showing precede changes in sub-cortical gray matter<ref name=pmid19181347>{{cite journal |author=Varga AW, Johnson G, Babb JS, Herbert J, Grossman RI, Inglese M |title=White Matter Hemodynamic Abnormalities precede Sub-cortical Gray Matter Changes in Multiple Sclerosis |journal=J.

At this time the evidence is largely anecdotal and some MS patients have no blood flow issues.  Possibly vascular problems may be an aggravating factor, like many others in MS. Indeed the research, by demonstrating patients with no hemodynamic problems actually prove that this is not the only cause of MS.

===Endothelium theories===

Other theories point to a possible primary endothelial dysfunction.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17239011 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.2006.00781.x | volume=33 | issue=1 | title=Persistent endothelial abnormalities and blood–brain barrier leak in primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis | year=2007 | month=February | author=Leech S, Kirk J, Plumb J, McQuaid S | journal=Neuropathol.

Some morphologically special medullar lesions (wedge-shaped) have also been linked to venous insufficiency.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20056253  | author-separator =, | last1 = Qiu | author-name-separator=  | first1 = W| doi=10.1016/j.jns.2009.12.017 | last2 = Raven | first2 = S | last3 = Wu | first3 = JS | last4 = Carroll | first4 = WM | last5 = Mastaglia | first5 = FL | last6 = Kermode | first6 = AG | title = Wedge-shaped medullary lesions in multiple sclerosis | journal = Journal of the neurological sciences | volume=290 | issue=1–2 | year=2010 | month=March | pages=190–3}}</ref>

It has also been pointed out that some infectious agents with positive correlation to MS, specially [[Chlamydia pneumoniae]], can cause problems in veins and arteries walls<ref>J. Gutiérrez, J. Linares-Palomino, C. Lopez-Espada, M. Rodríguez, E. Ros, G. Piédrola and M. del C. Maroto, Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA in the Arterial Wall of Patients with Peripheral Vascular Disease, Infection,  Volume 29, Number 4 (2001), 196-200, DOI: 10.1007/s15010-001-1180-0</ref>

===CCSVI===

The term "chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency" was coined in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni, who described it in patients with multiple sclerosis. Instead of intracranial venous problems he described extracranial blockages, and he stated that the location of those obstructions seemed to  influence the clinical course of the disease.<ref name="pmid19060024">{{Cite journal |author=Zamboni P, Galeotti R, Menegatti E, ''et al.'' |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=J.

J. Neurol. Sci. 2010; 37: 745-757 }}</ref>

A more detailed evidence of a correlation between the place and type of venous malformations imaged and the reported symptoms of multiple sclerosis in the same patients was published in 2010.<ref name="pmid20351674">{{Cite journal|author=Bartolomei I. et al |title=Haemodynamic patterns in chronic cereblrospinal venous insufficiency in multiple sclerosis.

===CSF flow theories===

Other theories focus in the possible role of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] flow impairment.<ref>Damadian RV, Chu D.

CSF dynamics and brain volume in multiple sclerosis are associated with extracranial venous flow anomalies, 2010 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20351670]</ref>

Currently a small trial with 8 participants has been performed<ref>Raymond V. Damadian and David Chu, The Possible Role of Cranio-Cervical Trauma and Abnormal CSF Hydrodynamics in the Genesis of Multiple Sclerosis [http://www.fonar.com/news/pdf/PCP41_damadian.pdf][http://www.fonar.com/news/110211.htm][http://www.fonar.com/news/100511.htm]</ref>

==Molecular biomarkers==

Diagnosis of MS has always been made by clinical examination, supported by MRI or CSF tests. According with the autoimmune hypothesis, researchers expect to find biomarkers able to yield a better diagnosis. As of 2009 no biomarker with perfect correlation has been found, but some of them have shown a special behavior.

===In blood===

Blood serum of MS patients shows abnormalities. [[Endothelin]]-1 shows maybe the most striking discordance between patients and controls, being a 224% higher in patients than controls.<ref>Haufschild T, Shaw SG, Kesselring J, Flammer J.

===MS types by RNA===

Also in blood serum can be found the RNA type of the MS patient. Two types have been proposed classifying the patients as MSA or MSB, allegedly predicting future inflammatory events.<ref>Linda Ottoboni, Brendan T. Keenan, Pablo Tamayo, Manik Kuchroo, Jill P.

Also a specific MS protein has been found in CSF, [[chromogranin A]], possibly related to axonal degeneration. It appears together with clusterin and complement C3, markers of complement-mediated inflammatory reactions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stoop MP, Dekker LJ, Titulaer MK, ''et al.'' |title=Multiple sclerosis-related proteins identified in cerebrospinal fluid by advanced mass spectrometry |journal=Proteomics |volume= 8|issue= 8|pages= 1576–85|year=2008 |pmid=18351689 |doi=10.1002/pmic.200700446}}</ref> Also [[Fibroblast growth factor]]-2 appear higher at CSF.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sarchielli P, Di Filippo M, Ercolani MV, ''et al.''|title=Fibroblast growth factor-2 levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients |journal=Neurosci Lett. |pmid=18353554 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2008.02.040 |volume=435 |issue=3 |year=2008 |month=April |pages=223–8}}</ref>

CSF also shows [[oligoclonal bands]] (OCB) in the majority (around 95%) of the patients. Several studies have reported differences between patients with and without OCB with regard to clinical parameters such as age, gender, disease duration, clinical severity and several MRI characteristics, together with a varying lesion load.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huttner HB, Schellinger PD, Struffert T, ''et al.'' |title=MRI criteria in MS patients with negative and positive oligoclonal bands: equal fulfillment of Barkhof's criteria but different lesion patterns |journal=J.

[[Varicella-zoster virus]] particles have been found in CSF of patients during relapses, but this particles are virtually absent during remissions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sotelo J, Martínez-Palomo A, Ordoñez G, Pineda B. |title=Varicella-zoster virus in cerebrospinal fluid at relapses of multiple sclerosis |journal=Ann Neurol. |volume= 63|issue= 3|pages= 303–11|year=2008 |pmid=18306233 |doi=10.1002/ana.21316}}</ref> Plasma Cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients could also be used for diagnosis, because they have been found to produce myelin-specific antibodies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=von Büdingen HC, Harrer MD, Kuenzle S, Meier M, Goebels N |title=Clonally expanded plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients produce myelin-specific antibodies |journal=Eur J Immunol. |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=2014–23 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18521957 |doi=10.1002/eji.200737784 }}</ref> As of 2011, a recently discovered myelin protein [[TPPP|TPPP/p25]], has been found in CSF of MS patients<ref>{{cite journal|pmid= 21565174 | doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.130 | volume=409 | issue=1 | title=A new myelin protein, TPPP/p25, reduced in demyelinated lesions is enriched in cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis | year=2011 | month=May | author=Vincze O, Oláh J, Zádori D, Klivényi P, Vécsei L, Ovádi J | journal=Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. | pages=137–41}}</ref>

==In brain cells==

Abnormal sodium distribution has been reported in living MS brains. In the early-stage RRMS patients, sodium MRI revealed abnormally high concentrations of sodium in brainstem, cerebellum and temporal pole. In the advanced-stage RRMS patients, abnormally high sodium accumulation was widespread throughout the whole brain, including normal appearing brain tissue.<ref>Cozzone, Zaaraoui and Ranjeva, "Distribution of Brain Sodium Accumulation Correlates with Disability in Multiple Sclerosis–A Cross-Sectional 23Na MR Imaging Study." Radiological Society of North America</ref> It is currently unknown wether post-mortem brains are consistent with this observation.

=== Subgroups by molecular biomarkers ===

Differences have been found between the proteines expressed by patients and healthy subjects, and between attacks and remissions. Using [[DNA microarray]] technology groups of molecular biomarkers can be established.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Satoh J. |title=Molecular biomarkers for prediction of multiple sclerosis relapse |journal=Nippon Rinsho |year=2008 |pmid=18540355 |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1103–11 |language=Japanese |trans_title=Molecular biomarkers for prediction of multiple sclerosis relapse }}</ref> For example, it is known that Anti-lipid oligoclonal IgM bands (OCMB) distinguish MS patients with early aggressive course and that these patients show a favourable response to immunomodulatory treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=García-Barragán N, Villar LM, Espiño M, Sádaba MC, González-Porqué P, Alvarez-Cermeño JC |title=Multiple sclerosis patients with anti-lipid oligoclonal IgM show early favourable response to immunomodulatory treatment |journal=Eur.

It seems that Fas and MIF are candidate biomarkers of progressive neurodegeneration. Upregulated levels of sFas (soluble form of [[Fas receptor|Fas]] molecule) were found in MS patients with hypotense lesions with progressive neurodegeneration, and also levels of MIF appeared to be higher in progressive than in non-progressing patients. Serum TNF-α and CCL2 seem to reflect the presence of inflammatory responses in primary progressive MS.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21397339 | doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2011.02.009 | volume=234 | issue=1–2 | title=Disease-associated inflammatory biomarker profiles in blood in different subtypes of multiple sclerosis: Prospective clinical and MRI follow-up study | year=2011 | month=May | author=Hagman S, Raunio M, Rossi M, Dastidar P, Elovaara I | pages=141–7 | journal = Journal of Neuroimmunology}}</ref>

==Heterogeneity of the disease==

Multiple sclerosis has been reported to be heterogeneus in its behavior, in its underlying mechanisms and recently also in its response to medication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leussink VI, Lehmann HC, Meyer Zu Hörste G, Hartung HP, Stüve O, Kieseier BC |title=Rituximab induces clinical stabilization in a patient with fulminant multiple sclerosis not responding to natalizumab : Evidence for disease heterogeneity |journal=J Neurology |volume=255 |issue=9 |pages=1436–8 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18685916 |doi=10.1007/s00415-008-0956-x }}</ref>

Four different damage patterns have been identified by her team in the scars of the brain tissue. Understanding lesion patterns can provide information about differences in disease between individuals and enable doctors to make more accurate treatment decisions. According to one of the researchers involved in the original research "Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity."

Also known as '''Lassmann patterns''',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gold R, Linington C |title=Devic's disease: bridging the gap between laboratory and clinic |journal=Brain |volume=125 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1425–7 |year=2002 |month=July |pmid=12076994 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/7/1425 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf147}}</ref> it is believed that they may correlate with differences in disease type and prognosis, and perhaps with different responses to treatment. This report suggests that there may be several types of MS with different immune-related causes, and that MS may be a family of several diseases. The four identified patterns are [http://www.neurologyreviews.com/aug02/nr_aug02_mslesion.html]:

; Pattern I : The scar presents [[T-cells]] and [[macrophages]] around blood vessels, with preservation of [[oligodendrocyte]]s, but no signs of [[complement system]] activation.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://immserv1.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec10/lec10_97.html| title=Part 1B Pathology: Lecture 11 - The Complement System| accessdate=2006-05-10| first=Nick| last=Holmes| date=15 November 2001}}</ref>
; Pattern II : The scar presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes, as before, but also signs of [[complement system]] activation can be found.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/122/12/2279| journal=Brain| volume=122| issue=12| pages=2279–2295| month=December| year=1999| title=A quantitative analysis of oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis lesions - A study of 113 cases| first=Claudia| last=Lucchinetti| coauthors=Wolfgang Brück, Joseph Parisi, Bernd Scheithauer, Moses Rodriguez and Hans Lassmann| accessdate=2006-05-10| doi=10.1093/brain/122.12.2279| pmid=10581222}}</ref> Though this pattern could be considered similar to damage seen in NMO, some authors report no AQP4 damage in pattern II lesions<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19822791 | doi=10.1001/archneurol.2009.199 | volume=66 | issue=10 | title=Humoral pattern II multiple sclerosis pathology not associated with neuromyelitis Optica IgG | pmc=2767176 | year=2009 | month=October | author=Kale N, Pittock SJ, Lennon VA, ''et al.'' | journal=Arch. Neurol. | pages=1298–9}}</ref>
; Pattern III : The scars are diffuse with inflammation, distal [[oligodendrogliopathy]] and [[microglia]]l activation. There is also loss of [[myelin-associated glycoprotein]] (MAG). The scars do not surround the blood vessels, and in fact, a rim of preserved myelin appears around the vessels. There is evidence of partial remyelinization and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. For some researchers this pattern is an early stage of the evolution of the others.<ref name=Barnett/>
; Pattern IV : The scar presents sharp borders and [[oligodendrocyte]] degeneration, with a rim of normal appearing [[white matter]]. There is a lack of oligodendrocytes in the center of the scar. There is no complement activation or MAG loss.

The meaning of this fact is controversial. For some investigation teams it means that MS is a heterogeneous disease. Others maintain that the shape of the scars can change with time from one type to other and this could be a marker of the disease evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michael H. Barnett, MBBS and John W.

Several correlations have been studied:

*'''With clinical courses:''' No definitive relationship between these patterns and the clinical subtypes has been established by now, but some relations have been established. All the cases with PPMS (primary progressive) had pattern IV (oligodendrocyte degeneration) in the original study<ref>[http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/12/2784 Primary progressive multiple sclerosis]</ref> and nobody with RRMS was found with this pattern. [[Balo concentric sclerosis]] lesions have been classified as pattern III (distal oligodendrogliopathy).<ref>(Article in Spanish) Estudio longitudinal mediante imagen de resonancia magnética (RM) del efecto de la azatioprina [http://www.fedem.org/revista/n13/actualidad.html]</ref> [[Neuromyelitis optica]] was associated with pattern II (complement mediated demyelination), though they show a perivascular distribution, at difference from MS pattern II lesions.<ref>The Mystery of the Multiple Sclerosis Lesion, Frontiers Beyond the Decade of the Brain, Medscape  [http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:xLNFPncN2OkJ:doctor.medscape.com/viewarticle/433621+the+lesion+project+neuromyelitis+optica&hl=es&gl=es&ct=clnk&cd=7&client=firefox-a]</ref>

*'''With MRI and MRS findings:''' The researchers are attempting this with magnetic resonance images to confirm their initial findings of different patterns of immune pathology and any evidence of possible disease "sub-types" of underlying pathologies. It is possible that such "sub-types" of MS may evolve differently over time and may respond differently to the same therapies.

==Primary progressive MS==

It is currently discussed wether Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) is a different pathological entity or a different degree of the same pathology. No agreement has been stablished but there are some pathological features that are specific to PPMS. For example, meningeal inflammation is different respect standard cases of Recurrent-Recidivant MS (RRMS)<ref>Choi SR, Howell OW, Carassiti D, Magliozzi R, Gveric D, Muraro PA, Nicholas R, Roncaroli F, Reynolds R., Meningeal inflammation plays a role in the pathology of primary progressive multiple sclerosis, PMID 22907116</ref>

==Pathology of early MS and silent MS==

Current [[McDonald criteria]] usually do not allow to stablish a diagnosis for definite MS before two clinical attacks have appeared. This means that for clinical definite cases, MS condition has been present for a long time, difficulting the study of the initial stages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frisullo G, Nociti V, Iorio R, ''et al.'' |title=The persistency of high levels of pSTAT3 expression in circulating CD4+ T cells from CIS patients favors the early conversion to clinically defined multiple sclerosis |journal=J Neuroimmunol. |volume=205 |issue=1-2 |pages=126–34 |year=2008 |month= December|pmid=18926576 |doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2008.09.003 }}</ref> Therefore for studying this initial stage no clinical CDMS cases and pathological definitions are normally used.<ref name="brain.oxfordjournals.org"/> Sometimes patients with their first isolated attack (Clinically Isolated syndrome, or CIS) are used instead.

Cases of MS before the CIS are sometimes found during other neurological inspections and are referred to as '''subclinical MS'''.,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hakiki B, Goretti B, Portaccio E, Zipoli V, Amato MP. |title=Subclinical MS: follow-up of four cases |journal= European Journal of Neurology|volume= 15|issue= 8|pages= 858–61|year=2008 |pmid=18507677 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2008.02155.x}}</ref> or sometimes '''Clinically silent MS'''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Engell T |title=A clinical patho-anatomical study of clinically silent multiple sclerosis |journal=Acta Neurol. Scand. |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=428–30 |year=1989 |month=May |pmid=2741673 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1989.tb03811.x }}</ref> The previous reference states that clinically silent MS plaques were located in the periventricular areas. This reference also reports an estimate of the prevalence of silent MS as high as about 25%.

Scler. | pages=55–62}}</ref>

Also cases after the CIS but before the confirming second attack ('''Preclinical MS''') can  be accepted to study the initial MS pathology<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lebrun C, Bensa C, Debouverie M, ''et al.'' |title=Unexpected multiple sclerosis: follow-up of 30 patients with magnetic resonance imaging and clinical conversion profile |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=195–198 |year=2008 |pmid=18202208 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2006.108274}}</ref> 

These studies are performed for ethiological research purposes and not for improving diagnosis.
