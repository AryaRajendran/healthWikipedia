'''Early intervention in psychosis''' is a clinical approach to those experiencing symptoms of [[psychosis]] for the first time. It forms part of a new prevention paradigm for psychiatry<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Patrick McGorry|McGorry PD]], Killackey EJ |title=Early intervention in psychosis: a new evidence based paradigm |journal=Epidemiol Psichiatr Soc |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=237–47 |year=2002 |pmid=12585014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Patrick McGorry|McGorry PD]], Killackey E, Yung A |title=Early intervention in psychosis: concepts, evidence and future directions |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=148–56 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18836582 |pmc=2559918}}</ref> and is leading to reform of [[community mental health service|mental health services]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Killackey E, Yung AR, [[Patrick McGorry|McGorry PD]] |title=Early psychosis: where we've been, where we still have to go |journal=Epidemiol Psichiatr Soc |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=102–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17619539}}</ref> especially in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iris-initiative.org.uk/about-us/history-of-ei-development-in-uk.html |title=IRIS History of the development of EI in the UK |accessdate= 2009-12-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Joseph R, Birchwood M |title=The national policy reforms for mental health services and the story of early intervention services in the United Kingdom |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=362–5 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16151542 |pmc=1197282 |url=http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/jpn/vol-30/issue-5/pdf/pg362.pdf}}</ref>
 
This approach centers on the early detection and treatment of early symptoms of psychosis during the formative years of the psychotic condition. The first three to five years are believed by some to be a critical period.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birchwood M |coauthors=Tood P; Jackson C |year=1988 |title=Early intervention in psychosis: the critical period hypothesis |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=Supplement 33 |issue=33 |pages=53–59 |pmid=9764127 |accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref> The aim is to reduce the usual delays to treatment for those in their first episode of psychosis. The provision of optimal treatments in these early years is thought to prevent relapses and reduce the long term impact of the condition. It is considered a [[prevention (medical)|secondary prevention]] strategy.

The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) has been shown as an indicator of [[prognosis]], with a longer DUP associated with more long term disability.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Marshall M |coauthors=Lewis S; Lockwood A; Drake R; Jones P; Croudace T |year=2005 |title=Association between duration of untreated psychosis and outcome in cohorts of first-episode patients: a systematic review |journal=[[Arch Gen Psychiatry]] |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=975–983 |pmid=16143729 |accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/62/9/975 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.9.975}}</ref>

==Components of the model==
There are a number of functional components of the early psychosis model,<ref>Edwards, J. & McGorry, P.D. (2002) (eds). ''Implementing Early Intervention in Psychosis. A guide to establishing early psychotic services.'' London. Martin Dunitz.</ref><ref name="IEPAWG">{{cite journal |author=International Early Psychosis Association Writing Group |year=2005 |title=International clinical practice guidelines for early psychosis |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=Supplement 48 |pages=s120-s124 |pmid=16055801 |accessdate= 2009-02-14 |doi=10.1192/bjp.187.48.s120}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Marshall M |coauthors=Lockwood A; Lewis S; Fiander M |year=2004 |title=Essential elements of an early intervention service for psychosis: the opinions of expert clinicians |journal=[[BMC journals|BMC Psychiatry]] |volume=4 |page=17 |pmid=15230978 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |url= http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/4/17 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-4-17 |pmc=455683}}</ref> and they can be structured as different sub-teams within early psychosis services. The emerging pattern of sub-teams are currently:

===Early psychosis treatment teams===
Multiple discipline clinical teams providing an intensive case management approach for the first three to five years. The approach is similar to [[assertive community treatment]], but with an increased focus on the engagement and treatment of this previously untreated population and the provision of evidence based, optimal interventions for clients in their first episode of psychosis. For example, the use of low-dose [[antipsychotic]] medication is promoted ("start low, go slow"), with a need for monitoring of side effects and an intensive and deliberate period of psycho-education for patients and families that are new to the mental health system. Interventions to prevent a further episodes of psychosis (a "relapse") and strategies that encourage a return to normal vocation and social activity are a priority. There is a concept of phase specific treatment for acute, early recovery and late recovery periods in the first episode of psychosis.

===Early detection function===
Interventions aimed at improving the detection and engagement of those early in the course of their psychotic conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Larsen TK |coauthors=Friis S; Haahr U; Joa I; Johannessen JO; Melle I; Opjordsmoen S; Simonsen E; Vaglum P |year=2001 |title=Early detection and intervention in first-episode schizophrenia: a critical review |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=323–334 |pmid=11380302 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0447.2001.00131.x}}</ref> Key tasks include being aware of early signs of psychosis and improving pathways into treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johannessen JO, McGlashan TH, Larsen TK, ''et al.'' |title=Early detection strategies for untreated first-episode psychosis |journal=Schizophr.

Prodrome or [[at risk mental state]] clinics are specialist services for those with subclinical symptoms of psychosis or other indicators of risk of transition to psychosis.

==History==
Early intervention in psychosis is a preventative approach for psychosis that has evolved as contemporary [[recovery model|recovery]] views of psychosis and [[schizophrenia]] have gained acceptance. It subscribes to a "post Kraepelin" concept of schizophrenia, challenging the current assumptions originally promoted by [[Emil Kraepelin]] in the 19th century, that schizophrenia (or [[dementia praecox]]) was a condition with a progressing and deteriorating course.  Psychosis is now formulated within a [[diathesis–stress model]], allowing a more hopeful view of prognosis, and expects full recovery for those with early emerging psychotic symptoms. It is more aligned with psychosis as continuum (such as with the concept of [[schizotypy]]) with multiple contributing factors, rather than schizophrenia as simply a neurobiological [[disease]].

Within this changing view of psychosis and schizophrenia, the model has developed from a divergence of several different ideas, and from a number of sites beginning with the [[deinstitutionalisation|closure of psychiatric institutions]] signaling move toward community based care.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Falloon I.R. | year = 1992 | title = Early intervention for fist episodes of schizophrenia: A preliminary exploration | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 4–15 | pmid = 1557469 }}</ref> In 1986, the Northwick Park study<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnstone EC |coauthors=Crow TJ; Johnson AL; MacMillan JF |year=1986 |title=The Northwick Park Study of first episodes of schizophrenia.

In the 1990s, evidence began to emerge that [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] was an effective treatment for [[delusion]]s and [[hallucination]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sensky T, Turkington D, Kingdon D, Scott JL, Scott J, Siddle R, O'Carroll M, Barnes TR |title=A randomized controlled trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy for persistent symptoms in schizophrenia resistant to medication |journal=Arch.

==Clinical outcome evidence==
A number of studies have been carried out to see whether the early psychosis approach reduces the severity of symptoms, improves relapse rates, and decreases the use of inpatient care, in comparison to standard care. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that: "There is some support for specialised early intervention services, but further trials would be desirable, and there is a question of whether gains are maintained. There is some support for phase-specific treatment focused on employment and family therapy, but again, this needs replicating with larger and longer trials."<ref>Marshall, M. & Rathbone, J. (2011). Early intervention for psychosis. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 15(6), CD004718.</ref> Advocates of early intervention for psychosis have been accused of selectively citing findings that support the benefits of early intervention, but ignoring findings that do not.<ref>Amos, A. (2013). An axeman in the cherry orchard: early intervention rhetoric distorts public policy. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 47(4), 317-320.</ref>

==Evidence on cost==
Studies have been published claiming that early psychosis services cost less than standard services, largely through reduced in-patient costs, and also save other costs to society.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1751-7893.2009.00145.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mihalopoulos C, McGorry PD, Carter RC |title=Is phase-specific, community-oriented treatment of early psychosis an economically viable method of improving outcome? |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=47–55 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10442439 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1999.tb10913.x}}</ref> However, the claimed savings have been disputed. A 2012 systematic review of the evidence concluded that: "The published literature does not support the contention that early intervention for psychosis reduces costs or achieves cost-effectiveness".<ref>Amos, A. (2012). Assessing the cost of early intervention in psychosis: a systematic review.  Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 46(8), 719-734.</ref>

==Reform of mental health services==
===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] has probably made the most significant service reform with their adoption of early psychosis teams, with early psychosis now considered as an integral part of comprehensive community mental health services. ''The Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide'' outlines service specifications and forms the basis of a newly developed fidelity tool.<ref name="implementation2001"/><ref>Birchwood, unpublished.</ref> There is a requirement for services to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis, as this has been shown to be associated with better long term outcome. The implementation guideline recommends:
* 14 to 35 year age entry criteria
* First three years of psychotic illness
* Aim to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 3 months
* Maximum caseload ratio of 1 care coordinator to 10–15 clients
* For every 250,000 (depending on population characteristics), one team
**Total caseload 120 to 150
**1.5 doctors per team
**Other specialist staff to provide specific evidence based interventions

===Australia and New Zealand===
In [[Australia]] the EPPIC initiative provides early intervention services.<ref>http://www.eppic.org.au/psychosis</ref> In the Australian government's 2011 budget, $222.4 million was provided to fund 12 new EPPIC centres in collaboration with the states and territories.<ref>http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/2011-12-budget-offers-greater-support-fo-mental-health-patients</ref> However, there have been criticisms of the evidence base for this expansion and of the claimed cost savings.<ref>Raven M. Evaluating evidence for Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centres (EPPIC).

[[New Zealand]] has operated significant early psychosis teams for more than ten years, following the inclusion of early psychosis in a mental health policy document in 1997.<ref>''Blueprint for mental health service''.</ref> There is a national early psychosis professional group, New Zealand Early Intervention in Psychosis Steering Group,<ref>http://www.earlypsychosis.org.nz</ref>  organising training events and producing local resources.

===Scandinavia===
Early psychosis programmes have continued to develop from the original TIPS services in [[Norway]]<ref name="TIPS"/> and the OPUS randomised trial in [[Denmark]].<ref name="OPUS1year">{{cite journal |author=Petersen L |coauthors=Nordentoft M; Jeppesen P; Ohlenschaeger J; Thorup A; Christensen TØ; Krarup G; Dahlstrøm J; Haastrup B; Jørgensen P |year=2005 |title=Improving 1-year outcome in first-episode psychosis: OPUS trial |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=187 | issue = Supplement 48 |pages=s98-s103 |pmid=16055817 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |doi=10.1192/bjp.187.48.s98}}</ref>

===North America===
[[Canada]] has extensive coverage across most provinces, including established clinical services and comprehensive academic research in [[British Columbia]] ([[Vancouver]]), [[Alberta]] (EPT in [[Calgary]]), and [[Ontario]] (PEPP, FEPP).  In the United States, the Early Assessment and Support Alliance is implementing early psychosis intervention statewide.<ref>http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/mentalhealth/services/easa/main.shtml</ref>

===Asia===
The first meeting of the [[Asia]]n Network of Early Psychosis (ANEP) was held in 2004.
