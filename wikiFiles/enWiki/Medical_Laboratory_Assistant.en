'''Medical Laboratory Assistants''' (MLAs) prepare, and in some cases process [[human sample|samples]] within a [[pathology]] laboratory. They also utilise pre-analytical systems in order for [[biomedical scientist]]s (BMS) or Medical Laboratory Scientific Officers to process the [[biochemistry|biochemical]] tests requested on the sample. The majority of an MLA's time is spent in processing [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s. As such, the MLA has to have excellent knowledge of their particular sample acceptance policy, whilst obeying the [[Data Protection Act 1998|data protection act]], [[Physician-patient privilege|patient confidentiality]], [http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/ COSHH] and the [http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/InformationPolicy/PatientConfidentialityAndCaldicottGuardians/AccessHealthRecordsArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4100563&chk=ZdxTGp Caldicott] rules.

A typical method of sample acceptance (in a clinical chemistry lab) is as follows:

# Sample is received.
# Sample is checked (to ensure that the sample is sent in the correct container for the specimen).
# Patient's details checked and matched on both form and sample (non-matching samples and/or forms rejected).
# Sample and form labelled with unique identifying number (UIN).
# Tests requested on form receipted onto UIN on computer system.
# Samples placed either on pre-analytical system by MLA or analysed immediately by BMS (dependent on test requested).
# UIN attached to patient using patient identifying details on form.

MLA's also deal with all sample queries and give low level advice to clinical staff on sample acceptance and correct sampling method. They may also do minor upkeep on the pre-analytical systems as well as further upkeep on some [[point of care]] analysers &mdash; depending on the laboratory in which they are based.
