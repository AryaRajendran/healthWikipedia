The '''visual system''' is the part of the [[central nervous system]] which gives organisms the ability to [[visual perception|process visual detail]], as well as enabling the formation of several non-imagephoto response functions. It detects and interprets information from [[visible light]] to build a representation of the surrounding environment. The visual system carries out a number of complex tasks, including the reception of light and the formation of monocular representations; the buildup of a binocular perception from a pair of two dimensional projections; the identification and categorization of visual objects; assessing distances to and between objects; and guiding body movements in relation to visual objects. The psychological process of visual information is known as [[visual perception]], a lack of which is called [[blindness]].  Non-image forming visual functions, independent of visual perception, include the [[pupillary light reflex]] (PLR) and circadian [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|photoentrainment]].

==History==

In the second half of the 19th century, many motifs of the [[nervous system]] were identified such as the [[neuron doctrine]] and brain localisation, which related to the [[neuron]] being the basic unit of the nervous system and [[Functional specialization (brain)|functional localisation in the brain]], respectively. These would become tenets of the fledgling [[neuroscience]] and would support further understanding of the visual system.

The notion that the [[cerebral cortex]] is divided into functionally distinct cortices now known to be responsible for capacities such as [[touch]] ([[somatosensory cortex]]), [[Motion (physics)|movement]] ([[motor cortex]]), and vision ([[visual cortex]]), was first proposed by [[Franz Joseph Gall]] in 1810.<ref name="Gross, 1994">{{cite journal |author=Gross CG |title=How inferior temporal cortex became a visual area |journal=Cereb.

==Biology of the visual system==
===Eye===
{{Main|Eye}}

The eye is a complex biological device. The functioning of a camera is often compared with the workings of the eye, mostly since both focus light from external objects in the [[field of view]] onto a light-sensitive medium. In the case of the camera, this medium is film or an electronic sensor; in the case of the eye, it is an array of visual receptors. With this simple geometrical similarity, based on the laws of optics, the eye functions as  a [[transducer]], as does a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD camera]].

Light entering the eye is [[refracted]] as it passes through the [[cornea]]. It then passes through the [[pupil]] (controlled by the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]) and is further refracted by the [[lens (vision)|lens]]. The cornea and lens act together as a compound lens to project an inverted image onto the retina.

====Retina====
[[Image:Cajal Retina.jpg|thumb|left|[[S. Ramón y Cajal]], ''Structure of the [[Mammal]]ian Retina, 1900'']]
{{Main|Retina}}
The retina consists of a large number of [[photoreceptor cell]]s which contain particular [[protein]] [[molecule]]s called [[opsin]]s. In humans, two types of opsins are involved in conscious vision: [[Rod cell|rod opsins]] and [[Cone cell|cone opsins]]. (A third type, [[melanopsin]] in some of the retinal ganglion cells (RGC), part of the body clock mechanism, is probably not involved in conscious vision, as these RGC do not project to the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN) but to the [[Pretectal area|pretectal olivary nucleus]] (PON).<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Güler | first = A.D. | coauthors = et al | date = | year = 2008 | month = May | title =  Melanopsin cells are the principal conduits for rod/cone input to non-image forming vision | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7191 | pages = 102–5 | publisher = | pmid =  18432195 | doi = 10.1038/nature06829| bibcode = | oclc = | format = Abstract | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = | pmc = 2871301 | postscript = . | ref = harv }}</ref>) An opsin absorbs a [[photon]] (a particle of light) and transmits a signal to the [[cell (biology)|cell]] through a [[signal transduction pathway]], resulting in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor. (For more information, see [[Photoreceptor cell]]).

Rods and cones differ in function. Rods are found primarily in the periphery of the retina and are used to see at low levels of light. Cones are found primarily in the center (or [[fovea]]) of the retina.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} There are three types of cones that differ in the [[wavelengths]] of light they absorb; they are usually called short or blue, middle or green, and long or red. Cones are used primarily to distinguish [[color]] and other features of the visual world at normal levels of light.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In the retina, the photoreceptors synapse directly onto [[bipolar cell of the retina|bipolar cell]]s, which in turn synapse onto [[ganglion cell]]s of the outermost layer, which will then conduct [[action potentials]] to the [[brain]]. A significant amount of [[visual processing]] arises from the patterns of communication between [[neuron]]s in the retina. About 130 million photoreceptors absorb light, yet roughly 1.2 million [[axons]] of ganglion cells transmit information from the retina to the brain. The processing in the retina includes the formation of center-surround [[receptive fields]] of bipolar and ganglion cells in the retina, as well as convergence and divergence from photoreceptor to bipolar cell. In addition, other neurons in the retina, particularly [[Horizontal cell|horizontal]] and [[amacrine cell]]s, transmit information laterally (from a neuron in one layer to an adjacent neuron in the same layer), resulting in more complex receptive fields that can be either indifferent to color and sensitive to [[motion (physics)|motion]] or sensitive to color and indifferent to motion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
'''Mechanism of generating visual signals''': The retina adapts to its change in light through the use of the rods. In the dark, the retinal has a bent shape called cis-retinal. When light is present, the retinal changes to a straight form called trans-retinal and breaks away from the opsin. This is called bleaching because the purified rhodopsin changes from violet to colorless in the light. In the dark, the rhodopsin absorbs no light therefore releasing glutamate cells which inhibit the bipolar cell. This inhibits the release of neurotransmitters to the ganglion cell. In the light, glutamate secretion ceases which no longer inhibits the bipolar cell from releasing neurotransmitters to the ganglion cell and therefore an image can be detected.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth D. ''Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function''. 5th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010.</ref><ref>http://webvision.med.utah.edu/GCPHYS1.HTM</ref>

The final result of all this processing is five different populations of ganglion cells that send visual (image-forming and non-image-forming) information to the brain:
#M cells, with large center-surround receptive fields that are sensitive to [[Depth perception|depth]], indifferent to color, and rapidly adapt to a stimulus;
#P cells, with smaller center-surround receptive fields that are sensitive to color and [[shape]];
#K cells, with very large center-only receptive fields that are sensitive to color and indifferent to shape or depth;
#[[Photosensitive ganglion cell|another population that is intrinsically photosensitive]]; and
#a final population that is used for eye movements. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A 2006 [[University of Pennsylvania]] study calculated the approximate [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of human retinas to be about 8960 kilobits per second, whereas [[guinea pig]] retinas transfer at about 875 kilobits.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-speed-of-sight Calculating the speed of sight – being-human – 28 July 2006 – New Scientist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2007 Zaidi and co-researchers on both sides of the Atlantic studying patients without rods and cones, discovered that the novel photoreceptive ganglion cell in humans also has a role in conscious and unconscious visual perception.<ref name="Zaidi, 2007">{{cite journal |author=Zaidi FH, Hull JT, Peirson SN, ''et al.'' |title=Short-wavelength light sensitivity of circadian, pupillary, and visual awareness in humans lacking an outer retina |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=24 |pages=2122–8 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18082405 |pmc=2151130 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.034 |url= |ref=harv}}</ref> The peak spectral sensitivity was 481&nbsp;nm. This shows that there are two pathways for sight in the retina – one based on classic photoreceptors (rods and cones) and the other, newly discovered, based on photoreceptive ganglion cells which act as rudimentary visual brightness detectors.

====Photochemistry====
{{Main|Visual cycle}}
In the visual system, '''retinal''', technically called ''retinene<sub>1</sub>'' or "retinaldehyde", is a light-sensitive [[retinene]] molecule found in the rods and cones of the [[retina]].  Retinal is the fundamental structure involved in the transduction of [[light]] into visual signals, i.e. nerve impulses in the ocular system of the [[central nervous system]].  In the presence of light, the retinal molecule changes configuration and as a result a nerve impulse is generated.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Fibers to thalamus===
====Optic nerve====
{{Main|Optic nerve}}
[[Image:1543,Vesalius'Fabrica,VisualSystem,V1.jpg|right|thumb|Information flow from the [[eye]]s (top), crossing at the [[optic chiasm]]a, joining left and right eye information in the [[optic tract]], and layering left and right visual stimuli in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]]. [[Visual_cortex#Primary_visual_cortex_.28V1.29|V1]] in red at bottom of image.
(1543 image from [[Andreas Vesalius]]' ''Fabrica'')]]
The information about the image via the eye is transmitted to the brain along the [[optic nerve]].  Different populations of ganglion cells in the retina send information to the brain through the optic nerve. About 90% of the [[axons]] in the optic nerve go to the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] in the [[thalamus]]. These axons originate from the M, P, and K ganglion cells in the retina, see above. This parallel processing is important for reconstructing the visual world; each type of information will go through a different route to [[perception]]. Another population sends information to the [[superior colliculus]] in the [[midbrain]], which assists in controlling eye movements ([[saccades]])<ref name='nolte'>{{cite book |author=Sundsten, John W.; Nolte, John |title=The human brain: an introduction to its functional anatomy |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2001 |pages=410–447 |isbn=0-323-01320-1 |oclc=47892833 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> as well as other motor responses.

A final population of [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s, containing [[melanopsin]], sends information via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (RHT) to the [[pretectum]] (pupillary reflex), to several structures involved in the control of [[circadian rhythms]] and [[sleep]] such as the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN, the biological clock), and to the [[ventrolateral preoptic nucleus]] ([[VLPO]], a region involved in sleep regulation).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lucas RJ, Hattar S, Takao M, Berson DM, Foster RG, Yau KW |title=Diminished pupillary light reflex at high irradiances in melanopsin-knockout mice |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5604 |pages=245–7 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12522249 |doi=10.1126/science.1077293 |url= |ref=harv}}</ref> A recently discovered role for photoreceptive ganglion cells is that they mediate conscious and unconscious vision – acting as rudimentary visual brightness detectors as shown in rodless coneless eyes.<ref name="Zaidi, 2007"/>

====Optic chiasm====
{{Main|Optic chiasm}}
The optic nerves from both eyes meet and cross at the optic chiasm,<ref>{{cite book |author=Turner, Howard R. |title=Science in medieval Islam: an illustrated introduction |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1997 chapter=Optics |pages=197 |isbn=0-292-78149-0 |oclc=440896281 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><!--[http://www.stanford.edu/~kendric/DPC3/medieval_eye_files/medieval_eye.pdf Another link to al-Haytham's sketch of optic chiasm]--><ref>{{harvnb|Vesalius|1543}}</ref> at the base of the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain. At this point the information coming from both eyes is combined and then splits according to the [[visual field]].  The corresponding halves of the field of view (right and left) are sent to the left and right halves of the brain, respectively, to be processed. That is, the right side of primary visual cortex deals with the left half of the ''field of view'' from both eyes, and similarly for the left brain.<ref name='nolte'/> A small region in the center of the field of view is processed redundantly by both halves of the brain.

====Optic tract====
{{Main|Optic tract}}
Information from the right ''visual field'' (now on the left side of the brain) travels in the left optic tract.  Information from the left ''visual field'' travels in the right optic tract.  Each optic tract terminates in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN) in the thalamus.
[[Image:Lateral geniculate nucleus.png|left|thumb|200px|Six layers in the LGN]]

===Lateral geniculate nucleus===
{{Main|lateral geniculate nucleus}}

The '''lateral geniculate nucleus''' (LGN) is a sensory relay nucleus in the thalamus of the brain. The LGN consists of six layers in [[human]]s and other [[primate]]s starting from catarhinians, including cercopithecidae and apes. Layers 1, 4, and 6 correspond to information from the contralateral (crossed) fibers of the nasal retina (temporal visual field); layers 2, 3, and 5 correspond to [[information]] from the ipsilateral (uncrossed) fibers of the temporal retina (nasal visual field). Layer one (1) contains M cells which correspond to the M (magnocellular) cells of the optic nerve of the opposite eye and are concerned with depth or motion. Layers four and six (4 & 6) of the LGN also connect to the opposite eye, but to the P cells (color and edges) of the optic nerve. By contrast, layers two, three and five (2, 3, & 5) of the LGN connect to the M cells and P (parvocellular) cells of the optic nerve for the same side of the brain as its respective LGN. Spread out, the six layers of the LGN are the area of a [[credit card]] and about three times its thickness.  The LGN is rolled up into two ellipsoids about the size and shape of two small birds' eggs. In between the six layers are smaller cells that receive information from the K cells (color) in the retina.  The neurons of the LGN then relay the visual image to the [[primary visual cortex]] (V1) which is located at the back of the brain ([[caudal end]]) in the [[occipital lobe]] in and close to the calcarine sulcus. The LGN is not just a simple relay station but it is also a center for processing; it receives reciprocal input from the cortical and subcortical layers and reciprocal innervation from the visual cortex.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

[[Image:Lisa analysis.png|left|thumb|200px| Scheme of the optic tract with image being decomosed on the way, up to simple cortical cells (simplified).]]

===Optic radiation===
{{Main|Optic radiation}}

The '''optic radiations''', one on each side of the brain, carry information from the thalamic [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] to layer 4 of the [[visual cortex]]. The P layer neurons of the LGN relay to V1 layer 4C β. The M layer neurons relay to V1 layer 4C α. The K layer neurons in the LGN relay to large neurons called blobs in layers 2 and 3 of V1. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

There is a direct correspondence from an angular position in the [[field of view]] of the eye, all the way through the optic tract to a nerve position in V1.
At this juncture in V1, the image path ceases to be straightforward; there is more cross-connection within the visual cortex.

===Visual cortex===
{{Main|Visual cortex}}
[[Image:Brodmann areas 17 18 19.png|thumb|200px|[[Visual cortex]]: V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 (also called MT)]]
The visual cortex is the largest system in the human brain and is responsible for processing the visual image. It lies at the rear of the brain (highlighted in the image), above the [[cerebellum]].  The region that receives information directly from the LGN is called the [[Visual_cortex#Primary_visual_cortex_.28V1.29|primary visual cortex]], (also called V1 and striate cortex). Visual information then flows through a cortical hierarchy.  These areas include V2, V3, V4 and area V5/MT (the exact connectivity depends on the species of the animal). These secondary visual areas (collectively termed the extrastriate visual cortex) process a wide variety of visual primitives. Neurons in V1 and V2 respond selectively to bars of specific orientations, or combinations of bars.  These are believed to support edge and corner detection.  Similarly, basic information about color and motion is processed here.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jessell, Thomas M.; Kandel, Eric R.; Schwartz, James H. |title=Principles of neural science |publisher=McGraw-Hill |chapter=27. Central visual pathways |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=533–540 |isbn=0-8385-7701-6 |oclc=42073108 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Visual association cortex===
{{Main|Two Streams hypothesis}}
As visual information passes forward through the visual hierarchy, the complexity of the neural representations increases.  Whereas a V1 neuron may respond selectively to a line segment of a particular orientation in a particular retinotopic location, neurons in the lateral occipital complex respond selectively to complete object (e.g., a figure drawing), and neurons in visual association cortex may respond selectively to human faces, or to a particular object.

Along with this increasing complexity of neural representation may come a level of specialization of processing into two distinct pathways: the dorsal stream and the ventral stream (the [[Two Streams hypothesis]],<ref name=UngerleiderMishkin>{{Cite journal |journal=Behav. Brain Res. |year=1982 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=57–77 |title=Contribution of striate inputs to the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex in monkeys |author=Mishkin M, Ungerleider LG. |pmid=7126325 |doi=10.1016/0166-4328(82)90081-X |postscript=. |ref=harv}}</ref> first proposed by Ungerleider and Mishkin in 1982). The dorsal stream, commonly referred to as the "where" stream, is involved in spatial attention (covert and overt), and communicates with regions that control eye movements and hand movements.  More recently, this area has been called the "how" stream to emphasize its role in guiding behaviors to spatial locations. The ventral stream, commonly referred as the "what" stream, is involved in the recognition, identification and categorization of visual stimuli.

However, there is still much debate about the degree of specialization within these two pathways, since they are in fact heavily interconnected.<ref name=Farivar>{{Cite journal|journal=Brain Res. Rev.|year=2009|title=Dorsal-ventral integration in object recognition|author=Farivar R.|doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2009.05.006|pmid=19481571|volume=61|issue=2|pages=144–53|postscript=.|ref=harv}}</ref>

===Visual categorization fMRI studies===
Alexander Huth, et.al., at the University of California, Berkeley, have demonstrated how five human subjects, each viewing over two hours of movie clips, were each scanned by [[functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] instruments. Each brain scan recorded blood flow in thousands of individual locations, across their respective brains. [[Principal components analysis]] of regularized linear regressions revealed 1700 visual categories of 30,000 locations in cortex. Huth et.al. found highly organized, overlapping maps that occupied over 20% of cortex.<ref>Alexander Huth, Shiniji Nishimoto, An T. Vu, and Jack Gallant, (December 19, 2012), [http://gallantlab.org/semanticmovies/ "A Continuous Semantic Space Describes the Representation of Thousands of Object and Action Categories Across the Human Brain"], ''[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/12/19/semanticspace/ Neuron']'</ref>

==Visual system and balance==
Along with [[proprioception]] and [[vestibular function]], the visual system plays an important role in the ability of an individual to control balance and maintain an upright posture.  When these three conditions are isolated and balance is tested, it has been found that vision is the most significant contributor to balance, playing a bigger role than either of the two other intrinsic mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hansson EE, Beckman A, Håkansson A |title=Effect of vision, proprioception, and the position of the vestibular organ on postural sway |journal=Acta Otolaryngol. |volume=130 |issue=12 |pages=1358–63 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=20632903 |doi=10.3109/00016489.2010.498024 |url= |ref=harv}}</ref> The clarity with which an individual can see his environment, as well as the size of the visual field, the susceptibility of the individual to light and glare, and poor depth perception play important roles in providing a feedback loop to the brain on the body's movement through the environment.
