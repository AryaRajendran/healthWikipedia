'''Stomatognathic disease''' or '''mouth disease''' refers to the diseases of the [[mouth]] ("stoma") and [[jaw]] <ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gnath(o)-</ref> ("gnath"). It is the term used by [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] (along with the synonym '''dental diseases'''), but other organizations use different terms. 

The mouth is an important organ with many different functions. It is also prone to a variety of medical and dental disorders.<ref>[http://www.mouth-disease.com/ Mouth Disease Information] Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref>

The clinical evaluation and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[oral mucosa|oral mucosal]] [[disease|diseases]] are in the scope of oral & maxillofacial pathology specialists and [[oral medicine]] practitioners,<ref name=Oral_mucosal>{{cite journal|last=Zadik|first=Yehuda|coauthors=Orbach Hadas; Panzok Amy; Smith Yoav; Czerninski Rakefet|title=Evaluation of oral mucosal diseases: inter- and intra-observer analyses|journal=J Oral Pathol Med  |year=2011|pmid=21883487|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0714.2011.01070.x/abstract|accessdate=15 December 2011|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0714.2011.01070.x|volume=41|issue=1|pages=68–72}}</ref> both disciplines of [[dentistry]].  
When a [[microscope|microscopic]] evaluation is needed, a [[biopsy]] is taken, and microscopically observed by a [[pathologist]]. The [[American Dental Association]] uses the term '''oral and maxillofacial pathology''', and describes it as "the specialty of [[dentistry]] and [[pathology]] which deals with the nature, identification, and management of diseases affecting the oral and maxillofacial regions. It is a science that investigates the causes, processes and effects of these diseases."<ref name="urlADA.org: Dentistry Definitions">{{cite web |url=http://www.ada.org/prof/ed/specialties/definitions.asp#definition |title=ADA.org: Dentistry Definitions |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] uses the term "Diseases of oral cavity, salivary glands and jaws."<ref name="urlICD-10:">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gk00.htm+k00 |title=ICD-10: |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Oral and maxillofacial pathology==
Oral and maxillofacial pathology, also sometimes termed oral pathology, is a speciality involved with the diagnosis and study of the causes and effects of diseases affecting the oral and maxillofacial regions (i.e. the mouth, the jaws and the face). It can be considered a speciality of dentistry and pathology.<ref name="Neville 2001">{{cite book|last=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CA, Bouquot JE.|first=|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia?page=ix (preface)|isbn=0721690033|edition=2nd}}</ref> Oral pathology is a closely allied speciality with [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], [[oral surgery]] and [[oral medicine]].

===Training===
====United Kingdom====
There are less than 30 oral pathologists in the UK. No medical degree is mandatory, only a dental degree. The shortest pathway to becoming a oral pathologist in the UK is completion of 2 years general professional training and then 5 years in a diagnostic histopathology training course. After passing the required exams and gaining a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training, the trainee is entitled to apply for registration as a specialist.<ref>{{cite web|title=The British Society of Oral & Maxillofacial Pathologists|url=http://www.bsomp.org.uk/content-wide.aspx?Group=career&Page=career_advice|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>

==Examples of conditions which can involve the mouth==
===Infections===
====Bacterial infections====
=====Scarlet fever=====
[[Scarlet fever]] is caused by [[streptococci]] species, and starts as [[tonsilitis]] and [[pharyngitis]] before involving the soft palate and the tongue. It usually occurs in children where a fever occurs and a rash develops on the skin. It is treated with penicillin and the prognosis is generally excellent.<ref name="Neville 2001">{{cite book|last=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CA, Bouquot JE.|first=|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0721690033|pages=165-166|edition=2nd}}</ref>

====Viral infections====

=====Herpes simplex virus=====
Another very common disorder of the oral cavity is infection with [[herpes simplex]] virus (HSV). This virus can cause [[blister]]s and sores around the mouth ([[gingivostomatitis]]) and lips ([[herpes labialis]]). HSV infections tend to recur periodically. Although many people get infected with the virus, only 10% actually develop the sores. The sores may last anywhere from 3–10 days and are very infectious. Some people have recurrences either in the same location or at a nearby site. Unless the individual has an impaired [[immune system]], e.g., owing to [[HIV]] or [[cancer]]-related immune suppression,<ref name="Cancer">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, ''et al.'' |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993–1006 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3}}</ref>
recurrent infections tend to be mild in nature and may be brought on by [[stress (biology)|stress]], sun, menstrual periods, trauma or physical stress.<ref>[http://www.herpesguide.ca/ Herpes Guide: How do I know if I have herpes] Canadian Herpes Information portal. Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref>

=====Mumps=====
[[Mumps]] of the salivary glands is a viral infection of the [[parotid gland]]s. This results in painful swelling at the sides of the mouth in both adults and children. The infection is quite contagious. Today mumps is prevented by getting [[vaccination|vaccinated]] in infancy. There is no specific treatment for mumps except for hydration and painkillers. Sometimes mumps can cause inflammation of the brain, testicular swelling or hearing loss.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/mumps.html What are Mumps] Ministry of health and long term care portal.

====Fungal infections====
=====Oral candidiasis=====
[[File:Oral thrush Aphthae Candida albicans. PHIL 1217 lores.jpg|thumbnail|right|Pseudomembranous candidiasis of the posterior mouth and oropharynx]]
[[Oral candidiasis]] is by far the most common fungal infection that occurs in the mouth. It usually occurs in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] individuals. Individuals who have undergone a transplant, [[HIV]], cancer or use [[corticosteroid]]s commonly develop candida of the mouth and oral cavity. Other risk factors are [[denture]]s and [[tongue]] [[tongue piercing|piercing]].<ref name="Candida">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Yehuda, Burnstein Saar, Derazne Estella, Sandler Vadim, Ianculovici Clariel, Halperin Tamar |title=Colonization of Candida: prevalence among tongue-pierced and non-pierced immunocompetent adults |journal=Oral Dis |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=172–5 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=19732353 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2009.01618.x}}</ref> The typical signs are a white patch that may be associated with burning, soreness, irritation or a white cheesy like appearance. Once the diagnosis is made, candida can be treated with a variety of anti fungal drugs.<ref>[http://www.colgate.com/app/Colgate/US/OC/Information/OralHealthAtAnyAge/Adults/WomensHealth/WomensOralHealthandOverallHealth.cvsp Women's Oral Health and Overall</ref>

===Salivary gland diseases===
There are both major and minor [[salivary gland]] in the mouth which secrete [[saliva]] and a variety of [[enzyme]]s to help process foods and make [[swallowing]] easy. These salivary glands can get infected or inflamed and can also be very painful; sometimes the salivary glands also develop benign and malignant [[cancer]]s.<ref>[http://www.vin.com/VINDBPub/SearchPB/Proceedings/PR05000/PR00045.htm Recognizing Oral Disease] World Small Animal Veterinary Association. Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref>
However, the most common problem with salivary gland is formation of stones in the small ducts which prevent free flowing of saliva. The gland swells as they cannot empty and often get infected. While most stones in the duct may resolve, sometimes surgery and [[antibiotic]]s are required.

===Mucosal disease===
====Aphthous stomatitis====
[[File:Aphthous ulcer.jpg|thumbnail|right|2 minor aphthae on the lower labial mucosa]]
[[Aphthous stomatitis]] is a condition where ulcers (canker sores) appear on the inside of the mouth, lips and on tongue. Most small canker sores disappear within 10–14 days. Canker sores are most common in young and middle aged individuals. Sometimes individuals with allergies are more prone to these sores. Besides an awkward sensation, these sores can also cause [[Paresthesia|tingling]] or a burning sensation. Unlike herpes sores, canker sores are always found inside the mouth and are usually less painful.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Good oral hygiene does help but sometime one may have to use a topical corticosteroid.<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/health-encyc/Diseases-of-The-Body/Diseases-of-the-Digestive-System-The-oral-cavity.html Diseases of the Digestive System The oral cavity] FAQ's Health Portal. Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref>

====Geographic tongue====
[[File:Geographic tongue (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|right|Geographic tongue]]
[[Migratory stomatitis]] is a condition that involves the [[tongue]] and other [[oral cavity|oral]] [[mucosa]]. The common migratory glossitis ([[geographic tongue]]) affects the anterior two thirds of the dorsal and lateral tongue mucosa of 1% to 2.5% of the population, with one
report of up to 12.7% of the population. The tongue is often fissured, especially. in elderly individuals. In the American population, a lower prevalence was reported among Mexican Americans (compared with Caucasians and African Americans) and cigarette smokers. When other oral mucosa, beside the dorsal and lateral tongue, are involved, the term migratory stomatitis (or ectopic geographic tongue) is preferred. In this condition, lesions infrequently involve also the ventral tongue and buccal or labial mucosa. They are rarely reported on the [[soft palate]] and [[floor of mouth|floor of the mouth]].<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962210004883}}</ref>

====Oral cancer====
[[File:PLoS oral cancer.png|thumbnail|right|An example of oral cancer. ]]
[[Oral cancer]] may occur on the lips, tongue, gums, floor of the mouth or inside the cheeks. The majority of cancers of the mouth are [[squamous cell carcinoma]]. Oral cancers are usually painless in the initial stages or may appear like an ulcer. Causes of oral cancer include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, exposure to sunlight (lip cancer), chewing tobacco, infection with [[human papillomavirus]], and [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].<ref name="HSCT">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Zeevi I, ''et al.'' |title=Oral cancer in patients after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: long-term follow-up suggests an increased risk for recurrence |journal=Transplantation |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1243–4 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21119507 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f9caaa}}</ref> The earlier the oral cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances for full recovery. If you have a suspicious mass or ulcer on the mouth which has been persistent, then you should always get a dentist to look at it. Diagnosis is usually made with a biopsy and the treatment depends on the exact type of cancer, where it is situated, and extent of spreading.

===Others===
====Burning mouth syndrome====
[[Burning mouth syndrome]] (BMS) is a disorder where there is a burning sensation in the mouth that has no identifiable medical or dental cause. The disorder can affect anyone but tends to occur most often in middle aged women. BMS has been hypothesized to be linked to a variety of factors such as the [[menopause]], dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]) and allergies. BMS usually lasts for several years before disappearing for unknown reasons. Other features of this disorder include [[anxiety]], depression and social isolation. There is no cure for this disorder and treatment includes use of hydrating agents, pain medications, vitamin supplements or the usage of  antidepressants.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0215/p615.html Burning Mouth Syndrome] American Academy of Family Physicians. Retrieved on 2010-02-01</ref>

====Halitosis====
Bad breath ([[halitosis]]) is a sign or a symptom rather than a specific pathology. It has many causes including smoking, alcohol, poor care of dentures, gum disease, chronic lung disease, breathing through the mouth, [[sinusitis]], liver disease, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], pregnancy, not brushing or flossing on a regular basis. Medications that cause dryness in the mouth can also cause bad breath. These include [[antidepressant]]s, [[H1 antagonist|anti histamines]] and [[antipsychotic]]s. The best way to prevent bad breath is to brush teeth frequently, clean the tongue, keep the nose and sinus clean and drink adequate water.
