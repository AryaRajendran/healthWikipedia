'''SH-SY5Y''' is a human derived [[Immortalised cell line|cell line]] used in scientific research. The original cell line, called SK-N-SH, from which it was subcloned was isolated from a bone marrow biopsy taken from a four year-old female with [[neuroblastoma]]. SH-SY5Y cells are often used as ''in vitro'' models of neuronal function and differentiation.

==History==
SH-SY5Y was cloned from a bone marrow biopsy derived line called SK-N-SH and first reported in 1973. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Biedler JL, Helson L, Spengler BA |title=Morphology and growth, tumorigenicity, and cytogenetics of human neuroblastoma cells in continuous culture |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=2643–52 |year=1973 |month=November |pmid=4748425 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/11/2643}}</ref> A neuroblast-like subclone of SK-N-SH, named SH-SY, was subcloned as SH-SY5, which was subcloned a third time to produce the SH-SY5Y line, first described in 1978.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Biedler JL, Roffler-Tarlov S, Schachner M, Freedman LS |title=Multiple neurotransmitter synthesis by human neuroblastoma cell lines and clones |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=38 |issue=11 Pt 1 |pages=3751–7 |year=1978 |month=November |pmid=29704 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/11_Part_1/3751}}</ref> The cloning process is essentially artificial selection, involving expansion of individual cells or a small group of cells that express a particular phenotype of interest, in this particular case neuron-like characteristic. The SH-SY5Y line is genetically female with two X and no Y chromosome, as expected given an origin from a four year-old female.

==Morphology==
The cells typically grow in tissue culture in two distinct ways. Some grow into clumps of cells which float in the media, while others form clumps which stick to the dish. Cells with short spiny [[neurite]]-like processes migrate out from these adherent clumps. SH-SY5Y cells possess an abnormal chromosome 1, where there is an additional copy of a 1q segment and is referred to trisomy 1q. SH-SY5Y cells are known to be dopamine beta hydroxylase active, acetylcholinergic, glutamatergic and adenosinergic. The cells have very different growth phases, outlined in the surrounding pictures. The cells both propagate via [[mitosis]] and differentiate by extending [[neurites]] to the surrounding area. While dividing, the aggregated [[cell (biology)|cell]]s can look so different from the differentiated cells following the K'anul-index tumor cellularity (TNF, for Tumor Necrosis Factor), that new scientists often mistake one or the other for contamination. The dividing cells can form clusters of cells which are reminders of their cancerous nature, but certain treatments such as [[retinoic acid]] and [[BDNF]] can force the cells to [[dendrify]] and differentiate.

==Media and Cultivation==
The most common growing cocktail used is a 1:1 mixture of [[DMEM]] and [[Ham's F12]] medium and 10% supplemental [[fetal bovine serum]]. The DMEM usually contains 1.5 g/L [[sodium bicarbonate]], 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM [[sodium pyruvate]] and 0.1 mM nonessential [[amino acids]]. The cells are always grown at 37 degrees Celsius with 95% air and 5% [[carbon dioxide]]. It is advised to cultivate the cells in flasks which are coated for cell culture adhesion, this will aid in differention and [[dendrification]] of the neuroblastoma. In general the cells are quite robust and will grow in most widely used tissue culture media. 

SH-SY5Y has a dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity and can convert glutamate to GABA. It will also form tumors in nude mice in around 3–4 weeks. The loss of neuronal characteristics has been described with increasing passage numbers. Therefore it is recommended not to be used after passage 20 or verify specific characteristics such as noradrenalin uptake or neuronal tumor markers.
