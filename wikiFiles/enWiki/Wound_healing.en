'''Wound healing''', or '''cicatrisation''', is an intricate process in which the skin (or another organ-tissue) repairs itself after injury.<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy">Nguyen, D.T., Orgill D.P., Murphy G.F. (2009). [http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:SMwjTN1yYb8J:scholar.google.com/+nguyen+orgill+murphy&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5 Chapter 4: The Pathophysiologic Basis for Wound Healing and Cutaneous Regeneration].

Once the protective barrier is broken, the normal (physiologic) process of wound healing is immediately set in motion. The classic model of wound healing is divided into three or four sequential, yet overlapping,<ref name="Stadelmann"/> phases: (1) [[hemostasis]] (not considered a phase by some authors), (2) inflammatory, (3) proliferative and (4) remodeling.<ref name="Quinn">Quinn, J.V.

This clot acts to control active [[bleeding]] (hemostasis). The speed of wound healing can be impacted by many factors, including the bloodstream levels of hormones such as oxytocin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Poquérusse|first=Jessie|title=The Neuroscience of Sharing|url=https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref>

In the inflammatory phase, bacteria and debris are [[phagocytosed]] and removed, and factors are released that cause the migration and division of cells involved in the proliferative phase.

The proliferative phase is characterized by [[angiogenesis]], [[collagen]] deposition, [[granulation tissue]] formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction.<ref name="Midwood">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2003.12.003 | last1 = Midwood | first1 = K.S. | last2 = Williams | first2 = L.V. | last3 = Schwarzbauer | first3 = J.E. | year = 2004 | title = Tissue repair and the dynamics of the extracellular matrix | url = | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 1031–1037 | pmid = 15094118 }}</ref>  In angiogenesis, new blood vessels are formed by vascular endothelial cells.<ref name="chang">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020007 | last1 = Chang | first1 = HY | last2 = Sneddon | first2 = JB | last3 = Alizadeh | first3 = AA | last4 = Sood | first4 = R | last5 = West | first5 = RB | last6 = Montgomery | first6 = K | last7 = Chi | first7 = JT | last8 = Van De Rijn | first8 = M | last9 = Botstein | first9 = D | title = Gene expression signature of fibroblast serum response predicts human cancer progression: similarities between tumors and wounds | url = http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020007 | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = E7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14737219 | pmc = 314300 }}</ref>  
In fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation, [[fibroblast]]s grow and form a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) by excreting collagen and fibronectin.<ref name="Midwood"/>  Concurrently, re-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which [[epithelial cell]]s proliferate and 'crawl' atop the wound bed, providing cover for the new tissue.<ref name="Garg">Garg, H.G. (2000).  ''Scarless Wound Healing''.  New York Marcel Dekker, Inc. Electronic book.</ref>  

In contraction, the wound is made smaller by the action of [[myofibroblast]]s, which establish a grip on the wound edges and contract themselves using a mechanism similar to that in smooth muscle cells.  When the cells' roles are close to complete, unneeded cells undergo apoptosis.<ref name="Midwood"/>

In the maturation and remodeling phase, collagen is remodeled and realigned along tension lines and cells that are no longer needed are removed by [[apoptosis]].

However, this process is not only complex but fragile, and susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing [[chronic wound]]s. Factors which may contribute to this include diabetes, venous or arterial disease, old age, and infection.<ref name="Enoch">Enoch, S. Price, P. (2004).

As mentioned above, wound healing is classically divided into hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs considerable overlapping among individual phases. Recently, a complementary model has been described,<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/> such that the many elements of wound healing are more-clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility in the fields of [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the ''early phase'' and the ''cellular phase'':<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/> 

The early phase, which begins immediately following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to hemostasis and formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix—providing structural support for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.

The cellular phase follows the early phase, and involves several types of cells working together to mount an inflammatory response, synthesize granulation tissue, and restore the epithelial layer.<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/> Subdivisions of the cellular phase are:  [1] [[Macrophage]]s and inflammatory components (within 1–2 days), [2] [[Epithelial]]-[[mesenchymal]] interaction: re-epithelialization ([[phenotype]] change within hours, migration begins on day 1 or 2, [3] [[Fibroblasts]] and [[myofibroblasts]]: progressive alignment, collagen production, and matrix contraction (between day 4 day 14), [4] [[Endothelial cell]]s and angiogenesis (begins on day 4), [5] Dermal matrix: elements of fabrication (begins on day 4, lasting 2 weeks) and alteration/remodeling (begins after week 2, lasting weeks to months—depending on wound size.).<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/>

== Inflammatory phase ==
[[File:Scab.jpg|thumb|A scab covering a healing wound]]
Just before the inflammatory phase is initiated, the [[clotting cascade|clotting]] cascade takes place in order to obtain [[hemostasis]], or stop blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract [[cell (biology)|cells]] that [[phagocytosis|phagocytise]] debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.

===Clotting cascade===
{{Main|Coagulation}}

When [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] is first wounded, [[blood]] comes in contact with [[collagen]], triggering blood [[platelet]]s to begin secreting inflammatory factors.<ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006">Rosenberg L., de la Torre J. (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic457.htm Wound Healing, Growth Factors].  Emedicine.com. Accessed January 20, 2008.</ref>  Platelets also express [[glycoprotein]]s on their [[cell membrane]]s that allow them to stick to one another and to [[platelet aggregation|aggregate]], forming a mass.<ref name="Midwood"/>

[[Fibrin]] and [[fibronectin]] cross-link together and form a plug that traps [[protein]]s and particles and prevents further blood loss.<ref name="Sandeman">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0047-6374(00)00177-9 | last1 = Sandeman | first1 = S.R. | last2 = Allen | first2 = M.C. | last3 = Liu | first3 = C. | last4 = Faragher | first4 = R.G.A. | last5 = Lloyd | first5 = A.W. | year = 2000 | title = Human keratocyte migration into collagen gels declines with in vitro ageing | url = | journal = Mechanisms of Ageing and Development | volume = 119 | issue = 3| pages = 149–157 | pmid = 11080534 }}</ref>  This fibrin-fibronectin plug is also the main structural support for the wound until collagen is deposited.<ref name="Midwood"/> Migratory cells use this plug as a matrix to crawl across, and platelets adhere to it and secrete factors.<ref name="Midwood"/>  The clot is eventually lysed and replaced with [[granulation tissue]] and then later with collagen.

Platelets, the cells present in the highest numbers shortly after a wound occurs, release a number of things into the blood, including ECM proteins and [[cytokine]]s, including [[growth factor]]s.<ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/>  Growth factors stimulate cells to speed their rate of division.  Platelets also release other proinflammatory factors like [[serotonin]], [[bradykinin]], [[prostaglandin]]s, [[prostacyclin]]s, [[thromboxane]], and [[histamine]],<ref name="Stadelmann"/> which serve a number of purposes, including to increase cell proliferation and migration to the area and to cause [[blood vessel]]s to become dilated and [[porous]].

===Vasoconstriction and vasodilation===
Immediately after a [[blood vessel]] is breached, ruptured [[cell membrane]]s release inflammatory factors like [[thromboxane]]s and [[prostaglandin]]s that cause the vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area.<ref name="Stadelmann"/>  This [[vasoconstriction]] lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by [[vasodilation]], a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding.<ref name="Stadelmann"/>  Vasodilation is the result of factors released by platelets and other cells.  The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is [[histamine]].<ref name="Stadelmann"/><ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/>  Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become [[edema]]tous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area.<ref name="Stadelmann"/>  Increased [[porosity]] of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like [[leukocyte]]s into the wound site from the [[bloodstream]].<ref name="Dealey">Dealey C.

===Polymorphonuclear neutrophils===
Within an hour of wounding, [[granulocyte|polymorphonuclear neutrophil]]s (PMNs) arrive at the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound for the first two days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day.<ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann">de la Torre J., Sholar A.

Accessed January 20, 2008.</ref> They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as [[kinin]]s.  Neutrophils phagocytise debris and bacteria and also kill bacteria by releasing [[free radical]]s in what is called a '[[respiratory burst]]'.<ref name="Greenhalgh">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1357-2725(98)00058-2 | last1 = Greenhalgh | first1 = D.G. | year = 1998 | title = The role of apoptosis in wound healing | url = | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 9| pages = 1019–1030 | pmid = 9785465 }}</ref><ref name="muller">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0305-4179(03)00198-0 | last1 = Muller | first1 = M.J. | last2 = Hollyoak | first2 = M.A. | last3 = Moaveni | first3 = Z. | last4 = La | first4 = T. | last5 = Brown | first5 = H. | last6 = Herndon | first6 = D.N. | last7 = Heggers | first7 = J.P. | year = 2003 | title = Retardation of wound healing by silver sulfadiazine is reversed by Aloe vera and nystatin | url = | journal = Burns | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 834–836 | pmid = 14636760 }}</ref>  They also cleanse the wound by secreting [[protease]]s that break down damaged tissue.

Other leukocytes to enter the area include [[helper T cell]]s, which secrete [[cytokines]] to cause more T cells to divide and to increase inflammation and enhance vasodilation and vessel permeability.<ref name="Dealey"/><ref name="Santoro">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.10.033 | last1 = Santoro | first1 = M.M. | last2 = Gaudino | first2 = G. | year = 2005 | title = Cellular and molecular facets of keratinocyte reepithelization during wound healing | url = | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 304 | issue = 1| pages = 274–286 | pmid = 15707592 }}</ref>  T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.<ref name="Dealey"/>

===Macrophages===
Macrophages are essential for wound healing.<ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/>  They replace PMNs as the predominant cells in the wound by two days after injury.<ref name="Expert Reviews">Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine.

The macrophage's main role is to phagocytize bacteria and damaged tissue,<ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/> and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases.<ref name="Deodhar and Rana">{{cite journal | last1 = Deodhar | first1 = AK | last2 = Rana | first2 = RE | title = Surgical physiology of wound healing: a review | url = http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=1997;volume=43;issue=2;spage=52;epage=6;aulast=Deodhar | journal = Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 52–6 | date = 4/1/1997 | pmid = 10740722 }}</ref>  Macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines, especially during the third and fourth post-wounding days.

=== Decline of inflammatory phase===
As inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site.<ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/>  These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative phase is underway.<ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/> In vitro evidence, obtained using the [[dermal equivalent]] model, suggests that the presence of macrophages actually delays wound contraction and thus the disappearance of macrophages from the wound may be essential for subsequent phases to occur.<ref name="springerlink.com">{{cite journal | last1= Newton | first1= P.

Because inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, clearing debris and inducing the proliferation phase, it is a necessary part of healing.  However, inflammation can lead to [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage if it lasts too long.<ref name="Midwood"/> Thus the reduction of inflammation is frequently a goal in therapeutic settings.  Inflammation lasts as long as there is debris in the wound.  Thus the presence of dirt or other objects can extend the inflammatory phase for too long, leading to a [[chronic wound]].

== Proliferative phase ==

About two or three days after the wound occurs, [[fibroblasts]] begin to enter the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase even before the inflammatory phase has ended.<ref name="Falanga, 2005">Falanga V.  (2005). Wound Healing.  American Academy of Dermatology (AAD).</ref>  As in the other phases of wound healing, steps in the proliferative phase do not occur in a series but rather partially overlap in time.

===Angiogenesis===
Also called neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound.<ref name="Kuwahara">Kuwahara R.T. and Rasberry R.  2007.  [http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic533.htm Chemical Peels]. Emedicine.com.  Accessed September 15, 2007.</ref> Because the activity of fibroblasts and epithelial cells requires oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is imperative for other stages in wound healing, like epidermal and fibroblast migration.  The tissue in which angiogenesis has occurred typically looks red (is [[erythema]]tous) due to the presence of [[capillary|capillaries]].<ref name="Kuwahara"/>

[[Stem cell]]s of [[endothelial cell]]s, originating from parts of uninjured blood vessels, develop [[pseudopod]]ia and push through the [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] into the wound site to establish new blood vessels.<ref name="Greenhalgh"/>  

[[Endothelial cell]]s are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin scab and [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] by angiogenic factors released by other cells,<ref name="romo">Romo T. and Pearson J.M. 2005.  [http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic13.htm Wound Healing, Skin].  Emedicine.com. Accessed December 27, 2006.</ref> e.g. from macrophages and platelets when in a low-oxygen environment.  Endothelial growth and proliferation is also directly stimulated by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and presence of [[lactic acid]] in the wound.<ref name="Falanga, 2005"/> 

To migrate, endothelial cells need [[collagenase]]s and [[plasminogen activator]] to degrade the clot and part of the ECM.<ref name="Stadelmann"/><ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/> [[Zinc]]-dependent [[metalloproteinase]]s digest [[basement membrane]] and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.<ref name="Lansdown">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2613.2001.00180.x | last1 = Lansdown | first1 = A.B.G. | last2 = Sampson | first2 = B. | last3 = Rowe | first3 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Experimental observations in the rat on the influence of cadmium on skin wound repair | url = | journal = International Journal of Experimental Pathology | volume = 82 | issue = 1| pages = 35–41 | pmid = 11422539 | pmc = 2517695 }}</ref>

When macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells are no longer in a hypoxic, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors.<ref name="Greenhalgh"/>  Thus, when tissue is adequately [[perfusion|perfused]], migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced. Eventually blood vessels that are no longer needed die by [[apoptosis]].<ref name="romo"/>

===Fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation===
Simultaneously with angiogenesis, [[fibroblast]]s begin accumulating in the wound site.  Fibroblasts begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding as the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers peak at one to two weeks post-wounding.<ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/>  By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound<ref name="Stadelmann"/>  Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding.

In the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts mainly migrate and proliferate, while later, they are the main cells that lay down the collagen matrix in the wound site.<ref name="Stadelmann"/>  Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells/precursors).<ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/>  Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed by the end of the inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin.<ref name="romo"/>   Fibroblasts then deposit [[ground substance]] into the wound bed, and later collagen, which they can adhere to for migration.<ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/>

[[Granulation tissue]] functions as rudimentary tissue, and begins to appear in the wound already during the inflammatory phase, two to five days post wounding, and continues growing until the wound bed is covered.  Granulation tissue consists of new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and the components of a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM). The provisional ECM is different in composition from the ECM in normal tissue and its components originate from fibroblasts.<ref name="merc"/> Such components include fibronectin, collagen, [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[elastin]], [[glycoprotein]]s and [[proteoglycan]]s.<ref name="romo"/>  Its main components are fibronectin and [[hyaluronan]], which create a very hydrated matrix and facilitate cell migration.<ref name="Lorenz"/> Later this provisional matrix is replaced with an ECM that more closely resembles that found in non-injured tissue.

Growth factors ([[PDGF]], [[TGF-β]]) and fibronectin encourage proliferation, migration to the wound bed, and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts.  Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site.  Hypoxia also contributes to fibroblast proliferation and excretion of growth factors, though too little oxygen will inhibit their growth and deposition of ECM components, and can lead to excessive, fibrotic [[scar|scarring.]]

====Collagen deposition====
One of fibroblasts' most important duties is the production of [[collagen]].<ref name="Kuwahara"/> 

Collagen deposition is important because it increases the strength of the wound; before it is laid down, the only thing holding the wound closed is the fibrin-fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to [[traumatic injury]].<ref name="Greenhalgh"/>  Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue construction attach to, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix laid down by fibroblasts.<ref name="Ruszczak">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.003 | last1 = Ruszczak | first1 = Z. | year = 2003 | title = Effect of collagen matrices on dermal wound healing | url = | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 12| pages = 1595–1611 | pmid = 14623403 }}</ref>

===Epithelialization===
The formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment.<ref name="romo"/>  [[Stratum basale|Basal]] [[keratinocyte]]s from the wound edges and [[dermal appendage]]s such as [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat glands]] and [[Sebaceous gland|sebacious (oil) glands]] are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization phase of wound healing.<ref name="DiPietro"/>  They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle.

===Contraction===<!-- This section is linked from [[Contraction]] -->
Contraction is a key phase of wound healing. If contraction continues for too long, it can lead to disfigurement and loss of function.<ref name="Hinz">{{cite journal | last1 = Hinz | first1 = B | title = Masters and servants of the force: the role of matrix adhesions in myofibroblast force perception and transmission | journal = [[European Journal of Cell Biology]] | volume = 85 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 175–81 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16546559 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.004 }}</ref> Thus there is a great interest in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modelled in vitro using the [[collagen gel contraction assay]] or the [[dermal equivalent]] model.<ref name="springerlink.com"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1083/jcb.124.4.401 | last1 = Grinnell | first1 = F. | year = 1994 | title = Fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and wound contraction | url = | journal = J. Cell Biol | volume = 124 | issue = 4| pages = 401–404 | pmid = 8106541 | pmc = 2119916 }}</ref>

Contraction commences approximately a week after wounding, when fibroblasts have differentiated into [[myofibroblast]]s <ref name="Eichler and Carlson">{{cite journal | last1 = Eichler | first1 = MJ | last2 = Carlson | first2 = MA | title = Modeling dermal granulation tissue with the linear fibroblast-populated collagen matrix: a comparison with the round matrix model | journal = Journal of dermatological science | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–108 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16226016 | doi = 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2005.09.002 }}</ref>  In [[full thickness]] wounds, contraction peaks at 5 to 15 days post wounding.<ref name="romo"/> Contraction can last for several weeks<ref name="Mulvaney"/> and continues even after the wound is completely reepithelialized.<ref name="Stadelmann"/> A large wound can become 40 to 80% smaller after contraction.<ref name="Lorenz"/><ref name="DiPietro"/>  Wounds can contract at a speed of up to 0.75&nbsp;mm per day, depending on how loose the tissue in the wounded area is.<ref name="romo"/>  Contraction usually does not occur symmetrically; rather most wounds have an 'axis of contraction' which allows for greater organization and alignment of cells with collagen.<ref name="Eichler and Carlson"/>

At first, contraction occurs without myofibroblast involvement.<ref name="Mirastschijski">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.007 | last1 = Mirastschijski | first1 = U. | last2 = Haaksma | first2 = C.J. | last3 = Tomasek | first3 = J.J. | last4 = Ågren | first4 = M.S. | year = 2004 | title = Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM 6001 attenuates keratinocyte migration, contraction and myofibroblast formation in skin wounds | url = | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 299 | issue = 2| pages = 465–475 | pmid = 15350544 }}</ref>  Later, fibroblasts, stimulated by growth factors, differentiate into myofibroblasts.  Myofibroblasts, which are similar to smooth muscle cells, are responsible for contraction.<ref name="Mirastschijski"/>  Myofibroblasts contain the same kind of actin as that found in [[smooth muscle]] cells.<ref name="Hinz"/>

Myofibroblasts are attracted by fibronectin and growth factors and they move along fibronectin linked to fibrin in the provisional ECM in order to reach the wound edges.<ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/>  They form connections to the ECM at the wound edges, and they attach to each other and to the wound edges by [[desmosomes]].  Also, at an adhesion called the [[fibronexus]], actin in the myofibroblast is linked across the cell membrane to molecules in the extracellular matrix like fibronectin and collagen.<ref name="Mirastschijski"/>  Myofibroblasts have many such adhesions, which allow them to pull the ECM when they contract, reducing the wound size.<ref name="Hinz"/>  In this part of contraction, closure occurs more quickly than in the first, myofibroblast-independent part.<ref name="Mirastschijski"/>  

As the actin in myofibroblasts contracts, the wound edges are pulled together.  Fibroblasts lay down collagen to reinforce the wound as myofibroblasts contract<ref name="Stadelmann"/> The contraction stage in proliferation ends as myofibroblasts stop contracting and commit apoptosis.<ref name="Hinz"/>  The breakdown of the provisional matrix leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondroitin sulfate, which gradually triggers fibroblasts to stop migrating and proliferating.<ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/>  These events signal the onset of the maturation stage of wound healing.

== Maturation and remodeling==
When the levels of collagen production and degradation equalize, the maturation phase of tissue repair is said to have begun.<ref name="Greenhalgh"/> During maturation, [[type III collagen]], which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by type I collagen.<ref name="Dealey"/> Originally disorganized collagen fibers are rearranged, cross-linked, and aligned along [[tension lines]].<ref name="Lorenz"/> The onset of the maturation phase may vary extensively, depending on the size of the wound and whether it was initially closed or left open,<ref name="merc"/> ranging from approximately 3 days<ref name=pollock/> to 3 weeks<ref>[http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/Extrace-Matric-Acute-Chronic-Wounds.html worldwidewounds.com] > [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/images/New_fig_3.jpg Figure 3 – The time relationship between the different processes of wound healing.] by Gregory S Schultz, Glenn Ladwig and Annette Wysocki – in turn adapted from Asmussen PD, Sollner B. Mechanism of wound healing. In: Wound Care. Tutorial Medical Series. Stuttgart: Hippokrates Verlag, 1993.</ref> The maturation phase can last for a year or longer, similarly depending on wound type.<ref name="merc"/>

As the phase progresses, the [[tensile strength]] of the wound increases, with the strength approaching 50% that of [[tissue (biology)|normal tissue]] by three months after injury and ultimately becoming as much as 80% as strong as normal tissue.<ref name="merc"/>  Since activity at the wound site is reduced, the scar loses its red appearance as [[blood vessel]]s that are no longer needed are removed by [[apoptosis]].<ref name="Greenhalgh"/>

The phases of wound healing normally progress in a predictable, timely manner; if they do not, healing may progress inappropriately to either a [[chronic wound]] <ref name="Midwood"/> such as a [[venous ulcer]] or pathological scarring such as a [[keloid scar]].<ref name="O'Leary">{{cite journal |pmid=12666691 |year=2002 |last1=O'Leary |first1=R |last2=Wood |first2=EJ |last3=Guillou |first3=PJ |title=Pathological scarring: Strategic interventions |volume=168 |issue=10 |pages=523–34 |journal=The European journal of surgery}}</ref><ref name="Desmouliere">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1067-1927.2005.130102.x |title=Tissue repair, contraction, and the myofibroblast |year=2005 |last1=Desmoulière |first1=Alexis |last2=Chaponnier |first2=Christine |last3=Gabbiani |first3=Giulio |journal=Wound Repair and Regeneration |volume=13 |pages=7–12 |pmid=15659031 |issue=1}}</ref>

==Factors affecting Wound Healing==
Many factors controlling the efficacy, speed, and manner of wound healing fall under two types: Local and Systemic Factors.

===Local Factors===

* Mechanical Factors
* Edema
* Ischemia and Necrosis
* Foreign Bodies
* Low Oxygen Tension

===Systemic Factors===

* Inadequete Perfusion
* Inflammation
* Nutrient
* Metabolic Diseases
* Immunosuppression
* Connective Tissue Disorders
* Smoking

== Research and development ==
Up until a decade ago, the classic paradigm of wound healing, involving [[stem cells]] restricted to organ-specific lineages, had never been seriously challenged. Since then, the notion of [[adult stem cells]] having cellular ''plasticity'' or the ability to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation.<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/> To be more specific, [[hematopoietic]] [[progenitor cells]] (that give rise to mature cells in the blood) may have the ability ''de-differentiate''  back into hematopoietic stem cells and/or ''transdifferentiate'' into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts.<ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al.">{{cite journal | last1=Song | first1=G | last2=Nguyen | first2=DT | last3=Pietramaggiori | first3=G | last4=Scherer | first4=S | last5=Chen | first5=B | last6=Zhan | first6=Q | last7=Ogawa | first7=R | last8=Yannas | first8=IV | last9=Wagers | first9=AJ | title=Use of the parabiotic model in studies of cutaneous wound healing to define the participation of circulating cells | journal=Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=426–432 | year=2010 |pmid = 20546556 | pmc=2935287 | doi=10.1111/j.1524-475X.2010.00595.x }}</ref>

===Stem cells and cellular plasticity===
Multipotent adult stem cells have the capacity to be self-renewing and give rise to different cell types. Stem cells give rise to progenitor cells, which are cells that are not self-renewing, but can generate several types of cells. The extent of stem cell involvement in cutaneous (skin) wound healing is complex and not fully understood. 

It is thought that the epidermis and dermis are reconstituted by mitotically active stem cells that reside at the apex of [[rete ridges]] (basal stem cells or BSC), the bulge of [[hair follicle]]s (hair follicular stem cell or HFSC), and the papillary dermis (dermal stem cells).<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/> Moreover, bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in cutaneous wound healing.<ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/>

In rare circumstances, such as extensive cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in the bone marrow are induced to participate in the healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair.<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/> These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSC) and (2) [[hematopoietic stem cells]] (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation ([[endothelial]] progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same type of setting, are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels.<ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/> Moreover, it thought that, extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of [[leukocytes]] (circulating [[fibrocyte]]s) to the injured region, where they perform various  functions related to wound healing.<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/>

=== Wound repair versus regeneration ===
There is a subtle distinction between ‘repair’ and ‘regeneration'.<ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/> An injury is an interruption of morphology and/or functionality of a given tissue. Repair refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury in an effort to re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost/damaged tissue. True tissue [[regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] refers to the replacement of lost/damaged tissue with an ‘exact’ copy, such that both morphology and functionality are completely restored. Mammals do not regenerate spontaneously. In some instances, such as skin, ‘partial regeneration’ may be induced by the use of biodegradable ([[collagen]]-[[glycoaminoglycan]]) scaffolds. These scaffolds are structurally analogous to [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) found in normal/un-injured dermis.<ref name="Yannas, Lee, Orgill, Skrabut, Murphy">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.3.933 |title=Synthesis and Characterization of a Model Extracellular Matrix that Induces Partial Regeneration of Adult Mammalian Skin |year=1989 |last1=Yannas |first1=I.

Pharmaceutical agents have been investigated which may be able to turn off [[myofibroblast]] differentiation<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05501.x |title=Pioglitazone-induced myofibroblast cell death: Implications for cutaneous scarring |year=2003 |last1=O'Leary |first1=R. |last2=Ponnambalam |first2=S. |last3=Wood |first3=E.J. |journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=149 |issue=3 |pages=665–7 |pmid=14511015}}</ref>

A new way of thinking derived from the notion that [[heparan sulfate]]s are key player in tissue homeostasis:  the process that makes the tissue replace dead cells by identical cells. In wound areas, tissue homeostasis is lost as the heparan sulfates are degraded preventing the replacement of dead cells by identical cells. [[Heparan sulfate analogue]]s cannot be degraded by all know heparanases and glycanases and bind to the free heparin sulfate binding spots on the ECM, therefore preserving the normal tissue homeostasis and preventing scarring.<ref name="Tong2">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1524-475X.2009.00548.x |title=Stimulated neovascularization, inflammation resolution and collagen maturation in healing rat cutaneous wounds by a heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan mimetic, OTR4120 |year=2009 |last1=Tong |first1=Miao |last2=Tuk |first2=Bastiaan |last3=Hekking |first3=Ineke M. |last4=Vermeij |first4=Marcel |last5=Barritault |first5=Denis |last6=Van Neck |first6=Johan W. |journal=Wound Repair and Regeneration |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=840–52 |pmid=19903305}}</ref><ref name="Barritault">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-4509(06)75306-8 |title=Les agents de régénération (ou RGTAs) : Une nouvelle approche thérapeutique |trans_title=Regenerating agents (RGTAs): a new therapeutic approach |language=French |year=2006 |last1=Barritault |first1=D. |last2=Caruelle |first2=J.-P. |journal=Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=135–44 |pmid=16568015}}</ref><ref name="Intech">Van Neck et al, Heparan sulfate proteoglycan mimetics thrive tissue regeneration: an overview.

==Simulating wound healing from a growth perspective==
Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the physical relationships governing wound healing and subsequent scarring, with mathematical models and simulations developed to elucidate these relationships.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsif.2008.0536 |title=A mathematical model of wound healing and subsequent scarring |year=2009 |last1=Cumming |first1=B.

The alignment of collagen describes the degree of scarring; basket-weave orientation of collagen is characteristic of normal skin, whereas aligned collagen fibers lead to significant scarring.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature07039 |title=Wound repair and regeneration |year=2008 |last1=Gurtner |first1=Geoffrey C. |last2=Werner |first2=Sabine |last3=Barrandon |first3=Yann |last4=Longaker |first4=Michael T. |journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue=7193 |pages=314–21 |pmid=18480812}}</ref>  It has been shown that the growth of tissue and extent of scar formation can be controlled by modulating the stress at a wound site.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/SLA.0b013e318220b159 |title=Improving Cutaneous Scar Formation by Controlling the Mechanical Environment |year=2011 |last1=Gurtner |first1=Geoffrey C. |last2=Dauskardt |first2=Reinhold H. |last3=Wong |first3=Victor W. |last4=Bhatt |first4=Kirit A. |last5=Wu |first5=Kenneth |last6=Vial |first6=Ivan N. |last7=Padois |first7=Karine |last8=Korman |first8=Joshua M. |last9=Longaker |first9=Michael T. |journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=254 |issue=2 |pages=217–25 |pmid=21606834}}</ref>

The growth of tissue can be simulated using the aforementioned relationships from a biochemical and biomechanical point of view.  The biologically active chemicals that play an important role in wound healing are modeled with Fickian diffusion to generate concentration profiles.  The balance equation for open systems when modeling wound healing incorporates mass growth due to cell migration and proliferation.  Here the following equation is used:

D<sub>t</sub>ρ<sub>0</sub> = Div (R) + R<sub>0</sub>, 

where ''ρ'' represents mass density, ''R'' represents a mass flux (from cell migration), and ''R<sub>0</sub>'' represents a mass source (from cell proliferation, division, or enlargement).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10237-003-0034-3 |title=Computational modeling of healing: An application of the material force method |year=2004 |last1=Kuhl |first1=E. |last2=Steinmann |first2=P. |journal=Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=187–203 |pmid=14872320}}</ref>

==Types==

===Primary intention===
involves epidermis and dermis without total penetration of dermis
healing by process of epithelialization
*When wound edges are brought together so that they are adjacent to each other (re-approximated)
*Minimizes scarring
*Most surgical wounds heal by primary intention healing
*Wound closure is performed with sutures (stitches), staples, or adhesive tape
*Examples: well-repaired [[laceration]]s, well reduced [[bone fracture]]s, healing after [[flap surgery]]

===Secondary intention===
*The wound is allowed to granulate
*Surgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system
*Granulation results in a broader scar
*Healing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection
*Wound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation
*Examples: [[gingivectomy]], [[gingivoplasty]], [[tooth extraction]] sockets, poorly reduced fractures.

===Tertiary intention===
(Delayed primary closure or secondary suture):
*The wound is initially cleaned, debrided and observed, typically 4 or 5 days before closure.
*The wound is purposely left open
*Examples: healing of wounds by use of [[tissue graft]]s.

If the wound edges are not reapproximated immediately, delayed primary wound healing transpires. This type of healing may be desired in the case of contaminated wounds. By the fourth day, phagocytosis of contaminated tissues is well underway, and the processes of epithelization, collagen deposition, and maturation are occurring. Foreign materials are walled off by macrophages that may metamorphose into epithelioid cells, which are encircled by mononuclear leukocytes, forming granulomas. Usually the wound is closed surgically at this juncture, and if the "cleansing" of the wound is incomplete, chronic inflammation can ensue, resulting in prominent scarring.

===Complications of Wound Healing===
{{Cleanup section|date=April 2012}}

The major complications are many: 

#Deficient Scar Formation: Result in wound dehiscence or rupture of the wound due to inadequate formation of granulation tissue.
#Excessive Scar Formation: [[Hypertrophic scar]], [[Keloid]], [[Desmoid]].
#Exuberant Granulation ([[Proud Flesh]]).
#Deficient Contraction (in skin grafts) or excessive contraction (in burns).
#Others: Dystrophic calcification, pigmentary changes, painful scars, inscisional hernia etc.
