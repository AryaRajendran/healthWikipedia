'''Radiation therapy''' (in [[American English]]), '''radiation oncology''', or '''radiotherapy''' (in the [[British English|UK]], [[Canadian English|Canada]] and [[Australian English|Australia]]), sometimes abbreviated to XRT or DXT, is the [[medicine|medical]] use of [[ionizing radiation]], generally as part of [[oncology|cancer treatment]] to control or kill [[malignant]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of [[adjuvant]] therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers.

Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the [[DNA]] of exposed tissue leading to [[mitotic catastrophe|cellular death]].  To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger [[absorbed dose]] there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from [[radiology]], the use of radiation in [[medical imaging]] and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Radiation may be prescribed by a [[radiation oncologist]] with intent to cure ("curative") or for [[Adjuvant chemotherapy|adjuvant]] therapy. It may also be used as [[palliative treatment]] (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormone therapy]], [[immunotherapy]] or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way. The precise treatment intent (curative<!--let's not use the term radical till we define it (below)-->, adjuvant, [[neoadjuvant]], therapeutic, or [[palliative]]) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. [[Total body irradiation]] (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a [[bone marrow transplant]]. [[Brachytherapy]], in which a [[Ionizing radiation#Human-made radiation sources|radiation source]] is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs.

Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of [[trigeminal neuralgia]], [[Vestibular schwannoma|acoustic neuromas]], severe [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|thyroid eye disease]], [[pterygium]], [[pigmented villonodular synovitis]], and prevention of [[keloid]] scar growth, vascular [[restenosis]], and [[heterotopic ossification]]. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.

==Mechanism of action==
Radiation therapy works by damaging the [[DNA]] of cancerous cells. This DNA damage is caused by one of two types of energy, [[photon]] or [[charged particle]]. This damage is either direct or indirect [[ionization]] of the atoms which make up the DNA chain.
Indirect [[ionization]] happens as a result of the ionization of water, forming [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], notably [[hydroxyl]] radicals, which then damage the DNA.

In photon therapy, most of the radiation effect is through free radicals. Because cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage, [[double-stranded DNA]] breaks prove to be the most significant technique to cause [[Apoptosis|cell death]]. Cancer cells are generally less [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] and more [[stem cell]]-like; they reproduce more than most healthy [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.

One of the major limitations of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in [[oxygen]]. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Oxygen is a potent [[radiosensitizer]], increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harrison LB, Chadha M, Hill RJ, Hu K, Shasha D |title=Impact of tumor hypoxia and anemia on radiation therapy outcomes |journal=Oncologist|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=492–508 |year=2002 |pmid=12490737 |doi= 10.1634/theoncologist.7-6-492|url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12490737}}</ref>
Much research has been devoted to overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as [[misonidazole]] and [[metronidazole]], and hypoxic [[cytotoxins]] (tissue poisons), such as [[tirapazamine]].  Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an [[oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound]] such as [[trans sodium crocetinate]] (TSC) as a  [[radiosensitizer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sheehan JP, Shaffrey ME, Gupta B, Larner J, Rich JN, Park D |title=Improving the radiosensitivity of radioresistant and hypoxic glioblastoma |journal= Future Oncology |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=1591–1601 |year=2010 | doi=10.2217/fon.10.123 |pmid=21062158}}</ref>

Charged particles such as [[proton]], [[boron]], [[carbon]], and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET ([[linear energy transfer]]) and have an antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the [[Bragg peak]] effect. See [[proton therapy]] for a good example of the different effects of IMRT vs. [[charged particle therapy]]. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction.<ref>Curtis RE, Freedman DM, Ron E, Ries LAG, Hacker DG, Edwards BK, Tucker MA, Fraumeni JF Jr. (eds). New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973–2000. National Cancer Institute. NIH Publ. No. 05-5302. Bethesda, MD, 2006.</ref> This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: [[head and neck cancers]]).
This x-ray exposure is especially bad for children, due to their growing bodies, and they have a 30% chance of a second malignancy after 5 years post initial RT.<ref>http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/fileadmin/ISS/PDF/Risikoanalyse/Georgetown/Robison.pdf</ref>

==Dose==
The amount of radiation used in photon radiation therapy is measured in [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80 Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40 Gy.

Preventative (adjuvant) doses are typically around 45 – 60 Gy in 1.8 – 2 Gy fractions (for breast, head, and neck cancers.) Many other factors are considered by [[radiation oncologist]]s when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether radiation therapy is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery.

Delivery parameters of a prescribed dose are determined during [[treatment planning]] (part of [[dosimetry]]). Treatment planning is generally performed on dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software. Depending on the radiation delivery method, several angles or sources may be used to sum to the total necessary dose. The planner will try to design a plan that delivers a uniform prescription dose to the tumor and minimizes dose to surrounding healthy tissues.

===Fractionation===
(This section only applies to photon RT although other types of radiation therapy may be fractionated).
The total dose is fractionated (spread out over time) for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells that were in a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more radioresistant) may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill. Fractionation regimens are individualised between different radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2 Gy per day, five days a week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within a certain amount of time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8 Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.

In some cases, two fractions per day are used near the end of a course of treatment. This schedule, known as a concomitant boost regimen or hyperfractionation, is used on tumors that regenerate more quickly when they are smaller. In particular, tumors in the head-and-neck demonstrate this behavior.

One fractionation schedule that is currently being heavily studied is hypofractionation.  This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses, and treatments are given less than once a day. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 3Gy/fraction to 20Gy/fraction.  The logic behind hypofractionation is to lessen the possibility of the cancer returning by not giving the cells enough time to reproduce.<ref>[Pollack, Alan, and Mansoor Ahmed . Hypofractionation: Scientific Concepts and Clinical Experiences. 1st. Ellicot City: LimiText Publishing, 2011]</ref>

One of the best-known alternative fractionation schedules is Continuous Hyperfractionated Accelerated Radiation therapy (CHART). CHART, used to treat lung cancer, consists of three smaller fractions per day. Although reasonably successful, CHART can be a strain on radiation therapy departments.

Another increasingly well-known alternative fractionation schedule, used to treat breast cancer, is called Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI). APBI can be performed with either brachytherapy or with external beam radiation. APBI normally involves two high-dose fractions per day for five days, compared to whole breast irradiation, in which a single, smaller fraction is given five times a week over a six-to-seven-week period.

Implants can be fractionated over minutes or hours, or they can be permanent seeds which slowly deliver radiation until they become inactive.

==Effect on different types of cancer==
Different cancers respond differently to radiation therapy.<ref>CK Bomford, IH Kunkler, J Walter. Walter and Miller’s Textbook of Radiation therapy (6th Ed), p311</ref><ref>"Radiosensitivity" on GP notebook http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=2060451853</ref><ref>"Radiation therapy- what GPs need to know" on patient.co.uk http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40002299/</ref><!-- Note: these refs support the whole list here -->

The response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.
Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include [[leukemias]], most [[lymphomas]] and [[germ cell tumors]].
The majority of [[epithelial cancers]] are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60-70Gy) to achieve a radical cure.
Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice. [[Renal cell cancer]] and [[melanoma]] are generally considered to be radioresistant.

It is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation "curability" of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example: [[Skin neoplasm|non-melanoma skin cancer]], [[head and neck cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], [[anal cancer]], [[prostate cancer]]. [[Metastatic]] cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.

Before treatment, a CT scan is often performed to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures. The patient is then sent for a simulation so that molds can be created to be used during treatment. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields.<ref name=camphausen>Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref>

The response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size. For complex reasons, very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of [[breast cancer]] with [[wide local excision]] or [[mastectomy]] followed by [[adjuvant radiation therapy]]. Another method is to shrink the tumor with [[neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensiting drugs include: [[Cisplatin]], [[Nimorazole]], and [[Cetuximab]].

==History==
{{Main|History of radiation therapy}}

Medicine has used radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]].<ref name="UAB">{{cite web| url=http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 | title=University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, History of Radiation Oncology|format=from the [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080105043216/http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 |archivedate = 2008-01-05}}</ref>  [[Emil Grubbe]] of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use x-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.<ref name=pioneer>{{cite journal | title = Pioneer in X-Ray Therapy | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] (New Series) | volume = 125 | date = 4 January 1957 | pages=18–19 | issue = 3236 }} [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1752791 (jstor stable link)]</ref>

The field of radiation therapy began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of [[Nobel Prize]]–winning scientist [[Marie Curie]] (1867–1934), who discovered the radioactive elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]] in 1898. This began a new era in medical treatment and research.<ref name=UAB>{{cite web| url=http://alpha.webcenter.uab.edu/sites/c3/1649/ | title=University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, History of Radiation Oncology}}</ref> Radium was used in various forms until the mid-1900s, when [[cobalt therapy]] and [[caesium]] units came into use. [[Linear particle accelerator|Medical linear accelerators]] have been used too as sources of radiation since the late 1940s.

With [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]’s invention of [[computed tomography]] (CT) in 1971, three-dimensional planning became a possibility and created a shift from 2-D to 3-D radiation delivery. CT-based planning allows physicians to more accurately determine the dose distribution using axial tomographic images of the patient's anatomy. Orthovoltage and [[cobalt]] units have largely been replaced by megavoltage [[linear accelerators]], useful for their penetrating energies and lack of physical radiation source.

The advent of new imaging technologies, including [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) in the 1970s and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) in the 1980s, has moved radiation therapy from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) [[tomotherapy]]. These advances allowed radiation oncologists to better see and target tumors, which have resulted in better treatment outcomes, more organ preservation and fewer side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtanswers.com/aboutus/history.aspx |title=History of Radiation Therapy: The Evolution of Therapeutic Radiology |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>

==Types==
Historically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are [[external beam radiation therapy]] (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or [[unsealed source radiotherapy]]. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. [[Particle therapy]] is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are [[proton]]s or heavier [[ions]]. Intraoperative radiation therapy or [[IORT]]<ref>{{cite web | author=Vaidya J |title = TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative radiation therapy) | url = http://www.targit.org.uk | accessdate = 2009-09-27}}</ref> is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or [[TARGIT]]), brain tumors and rectal cancers.

===External beam radiation therapy===
{{Main|External beam radiation therapy}}

The following three sections refer to treatment using x-rays.

====Conventional external beam radiation therapy====
Conventional external beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) is delivered via two-dimensional beams using linear accelerator machines. 2DXRT mainly consists of a single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. ''Conventional'' refers to the way the treatment is ''planned'' or ''simulated'' on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired ''plan''. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lay close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning to such an extent that tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites.

A new method to reduce rectal radiation injury in prostate cancer patients involves the use of an absorbable [[Prostate Rectum Spacers|spacer]] placed between the prostate and rectum. [[File:Prostate spacer.jpg|thumb|MRI showing hydrogel spacer pushing the rectum away from the prostate during radiotherapy.]]  Such spacers are commercially available in some regions, and are undergoing clinical trials in others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.augmenix.com/products/ |title=Products — Augmenix |publisher=Augmenix.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>  By temporarily altering  the anatomy these products have the potential to allow for improved cancer targeting while minimizing risk to neighboring healthy tissues.  [[Prostate Rectum Spacers]] should be compatible with all prostate cancer radiotherapy treatments including 3D conformal, IMRT and stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy.

====Stereotactic radiation====
{{main|radiosurgery}}

Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.

There are two types of stereotactic radiation. '''Stereotactic radiosurgery''' (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. '''Stereotactic body radiation therapy''' (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.org/PressRoom/PressKit/AnnualMeeting/documents/Timmerman.pdf |title=American Society for Radiation Oncology |publisher=Astro.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>

Some doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments are they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take six to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.

Stereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse, [[Cyberknife]], [[Gamma Knife]], [[Novalis]], [[Primatom]], [[Synergy]], [[X-Knife]], [[TomoTherapy]], [[Trilogy]] and [[Truebeam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/stereotacticradiation.aspx |title=Treatment Types: Stereotactic Radiation Therapy |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref> This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.

====Virtual simulation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy====
The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bucci M, Bevan A, Roach M | title = Advances in radiation therapy: conventional to 3D, to IMRT, to 4D, and beyond | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–34 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15761080 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.55.2.117/full | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.55.2.117}}</ref>

'''Virtual simulation''', the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.

An enhancement of virtual simulation is '''3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT)''', in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a [[beam's eye view]] (BEV) using a [[multileaf collimator]] (MLC) and a variable number of beams. <!--I took this out -- see discussion: The aim of this process is to improve the [[therapeutic index]] of the radiation therapy: by conforming the treatment volume-->When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.<ref name=camphausen/>

'''Intensity-modulated radiation therapy''' (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT.<ref name=Galvin>{{cite journal |author=Galvin JM, Ezzell G, Eisbrauch A, ''et al.'' |title=Implementing IMRT in clinical practice: a joint document of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine |journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=1616–34 |year=2004 |month=Apr |pmid=15050343 |doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.12.008 }}</ref> IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes,<ref name=camphausen/> for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irsa.org/imrt.html |title=Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy |publisher=Irsa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref> Computer-controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and treatment simulation ([[Treatment Planning]]). The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam’s intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissue is decreased or avoided completely. The customized radiation dose is intended to maximize tumor dose while simultaneously protecting the surrounding normal tissue. This may result in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.

3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast and lung. Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency program must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.

Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT,<ref>Hall, Eric; Wuu Cheng-Shie (2003) Radiation induced second cancers: the impact of 3D-CRT and IMRT. Int. J Rad. Onc. Biol. Phys,. Vol. 56, No. 1, pp. 83-8</ref> about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty—for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy. 

Another technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location. <ref>{{cite journal |author= Wing-Fai Loke, Tae-Young Choi, Teimour Maleki,Lech Papiez, Babak Ziaie, Byunghoo Jung |title=Magnetic Tracking System for Radiation Therapy  |journal=Ieee Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems |year=2010 |doi= 10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2046737 |volume= 4 |issue= 4 |pages= 223 }}</ref>. The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position. <ref>{{cite |author= M. Pourhomayoun, M. L. Fowler and Z.

Pourhomayoun, M. L. Fowler and Z. Jin |title=Robustness Analysis of Sparsity Based Tumor Localization under Tissue Configuration Uncertainty |journal=IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium (SPMB12) , 2012. }}</ref>

====Particle therapy====
{{Main|Particle therapy}}

In particle therapy ([[proton therapy]] being one example), energetic ionizing particles (protons or carbon ions) are directed at the target tumor.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/brain-tumour-patient-unaware-treatment-was-available-on-nhs-1301570.html Brain tumor patient 'unaware' treatment was available on NHS]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum (the [[Bragg peak]]) that occurs near the end of the particle's [[Range (particle radiation)|range]], and it then drops to (almost) zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.

===Brachytherapy===
{{Main|Brachytherapy}}
[[File:1 applicator.jpg|thumb|A SAVI brachytherapy device]]

Brachytherapy (internal radiation therapy) is delivered by placing radiation source(s) inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical,<ref name="GEC-ESTRO-Cervix">

In brachytherapy, radiation sources are precisely placed directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.<ref name="GEC-ESTRO-General" /><ref name="Stewart 2007">

As one example of the localized nature of breast brachytherapy, the SAVI device delivers the radiation dose through multiple catheters, each of which can be individually controlled. This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam radiation therapy and older methods of breast brachytherapy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yashar C, Blair S, Wallace A, Scanderbeg D | year = 2009 | title = Initial Clinical Experience with the Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant Brachytherapy Applicator for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation | url = | journal = Brachytherapy | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 367–372 | doi = 10.1016/j.brachy.2009.03.190 | pmid = 19744892 }}</ref>

===Radioisotope therapy (RIT)===
Systemic radioisotope therapy is a form of targeted therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through [[Route of administration|infusion]] (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of [[metaiodobenzylguanidine]] (MIBG) to treat [[neuroblastoma]], of oral [[iodine-131]] to treat [[thyroid cancer]] or [[thyrotoxicosis]], and of hormone-bound [[lutetium-177]] and [[yttrium-90]] to treat [[neuroendocrine tumors]] (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy). Another example is the injection of radioactive glass or resin microspheres into the [[Hepatic artery proper|hepatic artery]] to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases.

A major use of systemic radioisotope therapy is in the treatment of [[bone metastasis]] from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used in the treatment of bone metastasis are [[strontium-89]] and [[Samarium (153Sm) lexidronam|samarium (<sup>153</sup>Sm) lexidronam]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sartor O |title=Overview of samarium sm 153 lexidronam in the treatment of painful metastatic bone disease |journal=Rev Urol |volume=6 Suppl 10 |issue= Suppl 10|pages=S3–S12 |year=2004 |pmid=16985930 |pmc=1472939 }}</ref>

In 2002, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[ibritumomab tiuxetan]] (Zevalin), which is an anti-[[CD20]] [[monoclonal antibody]] conjugated to yttrium-90.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01138.html Fda Approves First Radiopharmaceutical Product To Treat Non-Hodgkin’S Lymphoma]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>
In 2003, the FDA approved the [[tositumomab]]/iodine (<sup>131</sup>I) tositumomab regimen (Bexxar), which is a combination of an iodine-131 labelled and an unlabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/tosicor062703.htm Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab – Product Approval Information – Licensing Action]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>
These medications were the first agents of what is known as [[radioimmunotherapy]], and they were approved for the treatment of refractory [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]].

==Side effects==
Radiation therapy is in itself painless. Many low-dose [[palliative]] treatments (for example, radiation therapy to bony [[metastases]]) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced in the days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.

Most side effects are predictable and expected. Side effects from radiation are usually limited to the area of the patient's body that is under treatment. Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.

The main side effects reported are fatigue and skin irritation, like a mild to moderate sun burn. The fatigue often sets in during the middle of a course of treatment and can last for weeks after treatment ends. The irritated skin will heal, but  may not be as elastic as it was before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/possiblesideeffects.aspx |title=Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer: Possible Side Effects |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>

===Acute side effects===
; Nausea and vomiting.
:This is not a general side effect of radiation therapy, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen (which commonly react a few hours after treatment), or with radiation therapy to certain nausing-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the [[vestibule of the ear|vestibules of the inner ears]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22245210] pubmed direct link for PMID 22245210</ref> As with any distressing treatment, some patients vomit immediately during radiotherapy, or even in anticipation of it, but this is considered a psychological response. Nausea for any reason can be treated with antiemetics.<ref>[https://www.caring4cancer.com/go/cancer/effects/side-effects-of-radiation-therapy.htm] Common radiation side effects</ref>

; Damage to the [[epithelium|epithelial]] surfaces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping/radiation-therapy-and-you/page8 |title=Radiation Therapy Side Effects and Ways to Manage them|publisher=National Cancer Institute |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>

:Epithelial surfaces may sustain damage from radiation therapy. Depending on the area being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this [[moist desquamation]] is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.

; Mouth and throat sores
:If the head and neck area is treated, temporary soreness and ulceration commonly occur in the mouth and throat.<ref name="radiobiology_for_the_radiologist_5">{{Cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Eric J. | title = Radiobiology for the radiologist | year = 2000 | publisher = Lippincott Williams Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-7817-2649-2, 9780781726498 | page =351 }}</ref> If severe, this can affect swallowing, and the patient may need painkillers and nutritional support/food supplements. The esophagus can also become sore if it is treated directly, or if, as commonly occurs, it receives a dose of collateral radiation during treatment of lung cancer.

; Intestinal discomfort
:The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea.

; Swelling ([[edema]] or oedema)
:As part of the general [[inflammation]] that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during radiation therapy. This is a concern during treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases, especially where there is pre-existing raised [[intracranial pressure]] or where the tumor is causing near-total obstruction of a [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (e.g., [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or main [[bronchus]]). Surgical intervention may be considered prior to treatment with radiation. If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive [[steroids]] during radiation therapy to reduce swelling.

; Infertility
:The [[gonads]] (ovaries and testicles) are very sensitive to radiation. They may be unable to produce [[gametes]] following '''direct''' exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment. [[Infertility]] can be efficiently avoided by sparing at least one gonad from radiation.<ref>O. Gutfeld, M. Wygoda, L. Shavit & T. Grenader : ''[http://www.ispub.com/journal/the_internet_journal_of_oncology/volume_7_number_1_38/article/fertility_after_adjuvant_external_beam_radiotherapy_for_stage_i_seminoma.html Fertility After Adjuvant External Beam Radiotherapy For Stage I Seminoma] . The Internet Journal of Oncology. 2007 Volume 4 Number 2</ref>

===Late side effects===
Late side effects occur months to years after treatment and are generally limited to the area that has been treated. They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.

; [[Fibrosis]]
: Tissues which have been irradiated tend to become less elastic over time due to a diffuse scarring process.

; Epilation
: Epilation (hair loss) may occur on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1 Gy. It only occurs within the radiation field/s. Hair loss may be permanent with a single dose of 10 Gy, but if the dose is fractionated permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45 Gy.

; Dryness
: The salivary glands and tear glands have a radiation tolerance of about 30 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]] in 2 Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical head and neck cancer treatments. Dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]) and dry eyes ([[xerophthalmia]]) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's [[Quality of life (Medical)|quality of life]]. Similarly, [[sweat glands]] in treated skin (such as the [[armpit]]) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal [[mucosa]] is often dry following pelvic irradiation.

; [[Lymphedema]]
: Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during radiation therapy. It is the most commonly reported complication in breast radiation therapy patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .<ref name="pmid9874399">{{cite journal| author=Meek AG| title=Breast radiation therapy and lymphedema | journal=Cancer | year= 1998 | volume= 83 | issue= 12 Suppl American | pages= 2788–97 | pmid=9874399| doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981215)83:12B+<2788::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-I }}</ref>

; Cancer
: Radiation is a potential cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen in a very small minority of patients – usually less than 1/1000. It usually occurs 20 – 30 years following treatment, although some haematological malignancies may develop within 5 – 10 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer. The cancer occurs within the treated area of the patient.

; Heart disease
: Radiation has potentially excess risk of death from heart disease seen after some past breast cancer RT regimens.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Taylor CW, Nisbet A, McGale P, Darby SC |title=Cardiac exposures in breast cancer radiation therapy: 1950s–1990s |journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=1484–95 |year=2007 |month=Dec |pmid=18035211 |doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.05.034 }}</ref>

; Cognitive decline
: In cases of radiation applied to the head radiation therapy may cause [[Radiation induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]]. Cognitive decline was especially apparent in young children, between the ages of 5 to 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5 year old children declined each year after treatment by several IQ points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/lateeffects/HealthProfessional/page4|title=Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>

; Radiation [[proctitis]]
: This can involve long-term effects on the rectum including bleeding, diarrhoea and urgency and is associated with radiation therapy to pelvic organs. Pelvic radiation therapy can also cause radiation cystitis when the bladder is affected

===Cumulative side effects===
Cumulative effects from this process should not be confused with long-term effects—when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nieder C, Milas L, Ang KK | title = Tissue tolerance to reirradiation | journal = Semin Radiat Oncol | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11034631 | doi = 10.1053/srao.2000.6593}}</ref>

===Effects on reproduction===
During the first two weeks after [[fertilization]], radiation therapy is lethal but not [[teratogenic]].<ref name=arnon2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/7.4.394}} [http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf]</ref> High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce [[congenital anomaly|anomalies]], [[Intrauterine growth restriction|impaired growth]] and [[mental retardation]], and there may be an increased risk of [[childhood leukemia]] and other tumours in the offspring.<ref name=arnon2011/>

In males previously having undergone radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy.<ref name=arnon2011/> However, the use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[micromanipulation technique]]s might increase this risk.<ref name=arnon2011/>

===Effects on pituitary system===
[[Hypopituitarism]] commonly develops after radiation therapy for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, head and neck tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies.<ref name=Fernandez_2009/> Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects [[growth hormone]] and [[gonadal hormone]]s.<ref name="Fernandez_2009">{{cite journal | author = Fernandez A, Brada M, Zabuliene L, Karavitaki N, Wass JA | title = Radiation-induced hypopituitarism | journal = Endocr. Relat. Cancer | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 733–72 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19498038 | doi = 10.1677/ERC-08-0231 }}</ref> In contrast, [[adrenocorticotrophic hormone]] (ACTH) and [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) deficiencies are the least common among people with radiation-induced hypopituitarism.<ref name=Fernandez_2009/> Changes in [[prolactin]]-secretion is usually mild, and vasopressin deficiency apppears to be very rare as a consequence of radiation.<ref name=Fernandez_2009/>

===Radiation therapy accidents===
There are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine [[Therac-25]] was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in [[Missouri]] overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25radiation.html|title=Missouri Hospital Reports Errors in Radiation Doses|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=26 February 2010 | first1=Walt | last1=Bogdanich | first2=Rebecca R. | last2=Ruiz}}</ref> Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. ASTRO has launched a safety initiative called  [http://astro.org/targetsafely Target Safely] that, among other things, aims to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from happening. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients to ask their doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/questions/safetyquestions.aspx |title=What Questions Should I Ask My Doctor?: Questions to ask after treatment ends |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>

==Use in non-cancerous diseases==
[[File:DupuytrensRadiotherapyHamburg.jpg|thumb|The beam's eye view of the radiotherapy portal on the hand's surface with the lead shield cut-out placed in the machine's gantry]]

Radiation therapy is used to treat early stage [[Dupuytren's contracture|Dupuytren's disease]] and [[Plantar fibromatosis|Ledderhose disease]].

When Dupuytren's disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then radiation therapy is used to prevent further progress of the disease. 

Radiation therapy is also used post surgery in some cases to prevent the disease continuing to progress.

Low doses of radiation are used typically three Grays of radiation for five days, with a break of three months followed by another phase of three Grays of radiation for five days.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Charles|last2=Seegenschmiedt|first2=M.
