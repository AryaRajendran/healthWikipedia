The '''neck''' is the part of the [[body]], on many terrestrial or secondarily aquatic [[vertebrates]], that distinguishes the [[head (anatomy)|head]] from the [[torso]] or trunk. The [[adjective]] (from Latin) signifying "of the neck" is '''cervical''' (though this more frequently used to describe the [[cervix]]).

==Anatomy of the human neck==
===Bony anatomy: The cervical spine===
The cervical portion of the ''[[vertebral column|human spine]]'' comprises seven bony segments, typically referred to as C-1 to C-7, with cartilaginous discs between each vertebral body. The neck supports the weight of the head and protects the nerves that carry sensory and motor information from the [[Human brain|brain]] down to the rest of the body. In addition, the neck is highly flexible and allows the head to turn and flex in all directions. From top to bottom the cervical spine is gently curved in convex-forward fashion. It is the least marked of all the curves of the column.

===Soft tissue anatomy===
In the middle line below the [[chin]] can be felt the body of the [[hyoid bone]], just below which is the prominence of the [[thyroid cartilage]] called "[[Adam's apple]]", better marked in men than in women.  Still lower the [[cricoid cartilage]] is easily felt, while between this and the [[suprasternal notch]] the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and isthmus of the [[thyroid gland]] may be made out. At the side the outline of the [[sternomastoid muscle]] is the most striking mark; it divides the anterior triangle of the neck from the posterior.  The upper part of the former contains the [[submaxillary gland]] also known as the [[submandibular gland]]s, which lies just below the posterior half of the body of the [[jaw]].  The line of the [[common carotid artery|common]] and the [[external carotid arteries]] may be marked by joining the sterno-clavicular articulation to the angle of the jaw.

The eleventh or [[spinal accessory nerve]] corresponds to a line drawn from a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process to the middle of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle and thence across the posterior triangle to the deep surface of the [[trapezius]].  The external [[jugular vein]] can usually be seen through the skin; it runs in a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the [[clavicle]], and close to it are some small lymphatic glands.  The [[anterior jugular vein]] is smaller, and runs down about half an inch from the middle line of the neck.  The [[clavicle]] or collar-bone forms the lower limit of the neck, and laterally the outward slope of the neck to the shoulder is caused by the [[trapezius muscle]].

== Neck pain ==
Disorders of the neck are a common source of pain.  The neck has a great deal of functionality but is also subject to a lot of stress.  Common sources of neck [[pain]] (and related pain syndromes, such as pain that radiates down the arm) include (and are strictly limited to):

* [[Whiplash (medicine)|Whiplash]], strained muscle or other soft tissue injury
* Cervical [[spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]]
* [[Cervical spinal stenosis]]
* [[Osteoarthritis]]
* Vascular sources of pain, like [[arterial dissection]]s or [[internal jugular vein]] [[venous thrombosis|thrombosis]]
* Cervical [[adenitis]]

==Necks in the animal kingdom==
The neck appears in some of the earliest of [[tetrapod]] fossils, and the functionality provided  has led to its being retained in all land vertebrates as well as marine-adapted tetrapods such as turtles, seals, and penguins. Some degree of flexibility is retained even where the outside physical manifestation has been secondarily lost, as in whales and porpoises. A morphologically functioning neck also appears among insects. Its absence in fish and aquatic arthropods is notable, as many have life stations similar to a terrestrial or tetrapod counterpart, or could othewise make use of the added flexibility.

The word "neck" is sometimes used as a convenience to refer to the region behind the head in some [[snail]]s, [[gastropod]] [[mollusk]]s, even though there is no clear distinction between this area, the head area, and the rest of the body.
