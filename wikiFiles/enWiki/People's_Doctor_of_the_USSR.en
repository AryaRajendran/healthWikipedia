'''People's Doctor of the USSR''' ({{lang-ru|Народный врач СССР}}) was an honorary title granted to citizens of the [[Soviet Union]]; it was established in 25 October 1977 by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and its creation was officialised on the n°44/1977 issue of [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Suprem Soviet]]'s official journal.
Its regulation was later modified and completed by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Suprem Soviet]]'s decree of 22 August 1988.

It was conferred by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Suprem Soviet]]'s presidency on behalf of the [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Health]]. A diploma of the [[Supreme Soviet]]'s presidency was given to those who were appointed ''People's Doctor''  jointly with the medal and its concerning certificate. The [[Title of honor|title]] could be bestowed to individual medical doctors and nurses but also to health care structures as [[Hospital#General|general hospital]]s, [[sanatorium]]s, [[maternity ward]]s or [[preventive medicine]] centres.

The awarded people or structures were selected for their worthwhile contributions to public health improvement, for their peculiar skills and expertise and for having proved abnegation and high moral qualities in their duties fulfilment.

Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1990) the title did not disappear and, on 30 December 1995, by a decree of the [[Russian presidency]], it was created the new title of ''[[Honorary titles of the Russian Federation|Meritorious Doctor of the Russian Federation]]''.

The title was firstly bestowed on 9 August 1978, when 5 people were awarded:
* Viktor Nikolayevich Vasilenko
* Lyudmila Vasilievna Yevstratova
* Viktor Mikhailovich Ilin
* Lyudmila Nilolayevna Mikhailova
* Zagipa Madievna Madiyeva
The last doctor to be praised was dr. Vitaly Prokopievich Sergeyev from [[Osh]] ([[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]), whom the medal was conferred on 20 December 1991.
