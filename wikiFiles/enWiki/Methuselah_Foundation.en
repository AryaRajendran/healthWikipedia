The '''Methuselah Foundation''' is a non-profit [[501(c)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] [[volunteer]] [[non-profit organization|organization]] that studies methods of extending lifespan.  It was co-founded by [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]], and is based in [[Springfield, Virginia]], [[United States]].<ref name=MFMission>

</ref> Activities of the foundation include My Bridge 4 Life, a community tool designed to help people deal with the different diseases of aging; the Mprize, a monetary prize given to anyone who efficiently rejuvenates and/or extends the healthy lifespan of [[mice]], and various collaborative projects under the umbrella concept of MLife Sciences. The foundation takes its name from the [[Methuselah|Biblical character]] whose name is commonly used to refer to any living organism reaching great age.

== Current projects ==
=== The Mprize ===

In 2003, de Grey and Gobel cofounded The Mprize (known then as the "Methuselah Mouse Prize"), an [[inducement prize contest]] designed to accelerate research into effective life extension interventions by awarding monetary prizes to researchers who extend the healthy lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths. Regarding this, de Grey stated in March 2005, "if we are to bring about real regenerative therapies that will benefit not just future generations, but those of us who are alive today, we must encourage scientists to work on the problem of aging."<ref>

The foundation believes that if reversing of aging can be exhibited in mice, an enormous amount of funding would be made available for similar research in humans, potentially including a massive government project similar to the [[Human Genome Project]], or by private for-profit companies.<ref name="mprize_overview">

==== Prize structure and current record holders ====

The foundation currently awards the following two prizes:

* A [[longevity]] prize for extending total lifespan
* A [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] prize focusing on intervention begun at older age 

The general average lifespan of a normal mouse is 1.5 to 2 years. Whenever a record is broken, the researcher receives an amount based on the current size of the prize and the percentage by which they exceed the previously held record.<ref name="mprize_overview"/>

The longevity prize allows any type of intervention, including [[Selective breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic engineering]]; only a single mouse has to be presented. {{As of|2009}}, the record holder is a mouse whose [[growth hormone]] receptor had been [[knockout mouse|genetically knocked out]]; it lived for 1819 days (almost 5 years).<ref name="mprize_record">

  | accessdate = 2009-03-14 }}
</ref> 
The rejuvenation prize deals with [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] studies involving at least 40 animals, 20 treated and 20 [[experimental control|control]]. Treatment may begin only at mid-life, and the average lifespan of the 10% longest living treated animals is used for the record. {{As of|2009}}, this record stands at 1356 days (about 3.7 years); the treatment was [[calorie restriction]].<ref name="mprize_record"/>

Until November 2004, the foundation ran a reversal prize instead of the rejuvenation prize, with the following rules: the treatment of the mouse could be started at any age, and days before treatment had started were counted double. The winner was a mouse that did not receive any dietary or pharmacological treatment at all, just an enriched environment. The mouse lived for 1551 days (about 4.2 years).<ref>

provided undergraduate college students in any academic discipline with the knowledge and logistical support to develop projects which contribute to the advocacy or support of the Methuselah Foundation or its mission of radically extending healthy human life. The MFURI provided students within the United States education system with the opportunity to receive college credits, scholarships, and recommendations for their efforts. Students from other countries were eligible to apply for many of the available scholarships. The MFURI project was administered by a team of volunteer supervisors and coordinators and received scholarship funding from the Methuselah Foundation.<ref>
