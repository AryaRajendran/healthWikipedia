The '''Geriatric Depression Scale''' (GDS) is a 30-item [[self-report inventory|self-report]] [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] used to identify [[clinical depression|depression]] in the elderly. The scale was first developed in 1982 by J.A. Yesavage and others.<ref>Yesavage JA, Brink TL, Rose TL, et al. Development and validation of a geriatric depression screening scale: a preliminary report. J Psychiatr Res. 1982-83;17(1):37-49. PMID 7183759</ref>

==Description==
The GDS questions are answered "yes" or "no", instead of a five-category response set. This simplicity enables the scale to be used with ill or moderately cognitively impaired individuals. The scale is commonly used as a routine part of a comprehensive [[geriatric]] assessment. One point is assigned to each answer and the cumulative score is rated on a scoring grid. The grid sets a range of 0-9 as "normal", 10-19 as "mildly depressed", and 20-30 as "severely depressed".

A [[diagnosis]] of clinical depression should not be based on GDS results alone. Although the test has well-established [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]] evaluated against other diagnostic criteria, responses should be considered along with results from a comprehensive diagnostic work-up. A short version of the GDS (GDS-SF) containing 15 questions has been developed,<ref>Sheikh JI, Yesavage JA. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS): recent evidence and development of a shorter version. Clin Gerontol. 1986 June;5(1/2):165-173.</ref> and the scale is available in languages other than [[English language|English]]. The conducted research found the GDS-SF to be an adequate substitute for the original 30-item scale. <ref>Lesher EL, Berryhill JS. Validation of the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form among inpatients. J Clin Psychol. 1994 Mar;50(2):256-60. PMID 8014251</ref>
