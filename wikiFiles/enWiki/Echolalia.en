'''Echolalia''' is the immediate and involuntary repetition of either ambient sounds or [[speech repetition| of vocalization]]s made by another person. It is closely related to [[echopraxia]], the automatic repetition of movements made by another person. 

The word "echolalia" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἠχώ}}, meaning "[[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]" or "to repeat",<ref>

Echolalia occurs during human [[child development]], with babies producing vowels, some consonants and echolalia between 6 to 9 months of age.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} It can also describe a speech disorder in humans with [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]]. 

==Associated conditions==
Echolalia can be present in [[autism]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simon N |title=Echolalic speech in childhood autism. Consideration of possible underlying loci of brain damage |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=11 |pages=1439–46 |year=1975 |pmid=812450 |doi=}}</ref> and other [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[aphasia]], [[Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome]], [[schizophrenia]], [[Asperger syndrome]], [[Alzheimers|Alzheimer's disease]], and, occasionally, other forms of [[psychopathology]] including catatonic subtype in [[schizophrenia]]. It is also frequently found in blind or visually impaired children, although most will outgrow this behavior. When involuntary, echolalia may be considered a [[tic]].

It has been observed after cerebral infarction (stroke).<ref name="pmid19585352">{{cite journal |author=Suzuki T, Itoh S, Hayashi M, Kouno M, Takeda K |title=Hyperlexia and ambient echolalia in a case of cerebral infarction of the left anterior cingulate cortex and corpus callosum |journal=Neurocase |volume= 15|issue= 5|pages=1–6 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19585352 |doi=10.1080/13554790902842037 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/13554790902842037&magic=pubmed&#124;&#124;1B69BA326FFE69C3F0A8F227DF8201D0}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Immediate echolalia causes the immediate repetition of a word or phrase. 

A typical pediatric presentation of echolalia might be as follows: a child is asked "Do you want dinner?"; the child echoes back "Do you want dinner?", followed by a pause, and then a response, "Yes. What's for dinner?"<ref>Bashe, P. R. ''The OASIS Guide to Asperger Syndrome; Advice, Support, Insight, and Inspiration''. Crown Publishers, 2001, p. 22.</ref>

In delayed echolalia, a phrase is repeated after a delay, such as a person with autism who repeats TV commercials, favorite movie scripts, or parental reprimands.
