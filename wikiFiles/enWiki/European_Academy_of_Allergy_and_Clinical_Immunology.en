The '''European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology''' (formerly the '''European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology''') is an international organisation of national associations and of individual persons, constituted as an association pursuant to Article 60<ref>Associations which have a political, religious, scientific, artistic, charitable, social, or any other than an industrial object, acquire the status of a person as soon as they show by their constitution their intention to have a corporate existence. The constitution must be drawn up in writing and state the object, the capital and the organization of the society.</ref> ''[[et seq.]]'' of the [[Zivilgesetzbuch|Swiss Civil Code]]. The Academy is currently domiciled in [[Zürich|Zurich, Switzerland]].

==Purpose==
The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is a non-profit organisation active in the field of allergic and immunologic diseases such as [[asthma]], [[rhinitis]], [[eczema]], occupational [[allergy]], food and [[drug allergy]] and [[anaphylaxis]]. EAACI was founded in 1956 in [[Florence, Italy]] and has become the largest medical association in Europe in the field of allergy and [[clinical immunology]]. It includes more than 6,500 individual members from 107 countries, as well as 41 National Allergy Societies.<ref>http://www.eaaci.net/</ref>

The EAACI Constitution<ref>http://www.eaaci.net/organization/constitution</ref> states:
The Academy shall be a non-profit organisation in the area of allergology and [[clinical immunology]] aimed at:
* promoting basic and clinical research;
* collecting, assessing and diffusing scientific information;
* being a scientific reference body for other scientific, health and political organisations;
* encouraging and providing training and continuous education
* collaborating with patients and lay organisations

==Sections==

In order to strengthen its influence on the work of the main clinical specialities where allergy and clinical immunology is of importance, the EAACI has formed five sections. These sections co-ordinate and represent the activities of all members and affiliates who have expressed a wish to join the Section and will act as a focus and point of contact for relevant specialty societies and non-members. The sections are: Asthma, Immunology, Dermatology, ENT, and Pediatrics.<ref>http://www.eaaci.net/sections-a-igs (primary source)</ref>

==Congress==
The EAACI organises its main congress each June.<ref>http://www.eaaci.net/activities/congresses</ref> It includes scientific communication of abstracts (posters and oral communications), workshops and symposia. The congress features extensive multi-day scientific programmes, with 7,000-8,000 international participating delegates, providing in-depth understanding and discussion within targeted medical communities on topics such as:
*Asthma
*Drug hypersensitivity
*Pediatric allergy
*Molecular allergology
*Allergic rhinitis
*Basic immunology
*Food allergy
