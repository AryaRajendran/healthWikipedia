'''Critical care nursing''' is the field of [[nursing]] with a focus on the utmost care of the critically ill or unstable patients. Critical care nurses can be found working in a wide variety of environments and specialties, such as  [[emergency department]]s and the [[intensive care]] units.

== Training and education ==
Most critical care nurses in the U.S. are [[registered nurses]]{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Due to the unstable nature of the patient population the [[Licensed practical nurse|LPN/LVNs]] are rarely utilized in a primary care role in the intensive care unit. However, with proper training and experience LPN/LVNs can play a significant role in providing exceptional bedside care for the critically ill patient{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

Nurses in the US who wish to obtain certification in critical care nursing can do so through a national advisory board, known as the American Association of Critical Care Nurses. This advisory board sets and maintains standards for critical care nurses. The certification offered by this board is known as CCRN. This does not stand for 'Critical Care Registered Nurse' as is popularly believed, but is merely a ''certification'' as a critical care nurse for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations. 

''Registration'' is a regulatory term for the process that occurs between the individual nurse and the state in which the nurse practices. All nurses in the US are registered as nurses without a specialty. The CCRN is an example of a post registration specialty certification in critical care. 

There are also variants of critical care certification test that the AACN offers to allow nurses to certify in progressive care (PCCN), cardiac medicine (CMC) and cardiac surgery (CSC). In addition, [[Clinical Nurse Specialist]]s can certify in adult, neonatal and pediatric acute and critical care (CCNS). In November, 2007, the AACN Certification Corporation launched the ACNPC, an advanced practice certification examination for [[Acute Care Nurse Practitioner]]s {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}. None of these certifications confer any additional practice privileges, as nursing practice is regulated by the individual's state board of nursing. These certifications are not required to work in an intensive care unit, but are encouraged by employers, as the tests for these certifications tend to be difficult to pass and require an extensive knowledge of both pathophysiology and critical care medical and nursing practices. The certification, while difficult to obtain, is looked upon by many in the field as demonstrating expertise in the field of critical care nursing, and demonstrating the individual's nurse's desire to advance their knowledge base and skill set, thereby allowing them to better care for their patients.

Intensive care nurses are also required to be comfortable with a wide variety 
of technology and its uses in the critical care setting. This technology includes such equipment as hemodynamic and cardiac monitoring systems, [[mechanical ventilator]] therapy, [[intra-aortic balloon pump]]s (IABP), [[ventricular assist device]]s (LVAD and RVAD), [[continuous renal replacement]] equipment (CRRT/CVVHDF), [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] circuits (ECMO) and many other advanced life support devices. The training for the use of this equipment is provided through a network of in-hospital inservices, manufacturer training, and many hours of education time with experienced operators. Annual continuing education is required by most states in the U.S. and by many employers to ensure that all skills are kept up to date. Many intensive care unit management teams will send their nurses to conferences to ensure that the staff is kept up to the current state of this rapidly changing technology.

== Employment areas ==
Critical care nurses work in a variety of different areas, with a diverse patient population. There are many critical care nurses working in hospitals in intensive care units, post-operative care and high dependency units. They also work on medical evacuation and transport teams.

In August 2004, to demonstrate the work of critical care nurses [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] invited reporter Scott Allen and photographer Michelle McDonald from [[The Boston Globe]] to take part in an 'immersion experience' in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). ''The Globe'' staffers spent eight months shadowing an experienced [[nurse]] and a trainee nurse to learn about nursing practice first hand. The result was a four part, front-page series that ran from October 23–-October 26, 2005, entitled ''Critical Care: The making of an ICU nurse''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Allen|first=Scott|author-link=| title=Critical Care: The Making of an ICU Nurse.|newspaper=The Boston Globe|publication-place=Boston, MA|date=October 23, 2005}}</ref>

The added psychological stress of nursing in critical care units has been well-documented, and it has been argued the stress experienced in ICU areas are unique in the profession.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hay, MD |first1=Donald |last2=Oken, MD |first2=Donald |year=March–April 1972 |title=The Psychological Stresses of Intensive Care Unit Nursing |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=109–118 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/34/2/109.full.pdf |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>

== Subspecialities ==
Subspecialities of critical care nursing include such areas as [[Neonatal intensive care unit|Neonatal Intensive Care]] (or NICU, also called Nursery ICU), [[Pediatric intensive care unit|Pediatric Intensive Care]] (or PICU), and Adult Intensive Care (or ICU). The patient population of these units is generally based on the age of the patient. 
    
Further specialties of care can be found based on the disorder, disease or primary injury of the patient population. For example, a unit that is an Adult Intensive care unit, specialized in the care of trauma patients would be an Adult Trauma Intensive Care Unit. The focus of the unit is generally on either an adult or a pediatric/neonatal population, as the treatment methods differ for the age ranges.
