'''Nortriptyline''' is a second-generation [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA) marketed as the [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] under the trade names '''Sensoval''', '''Aventyl''', '''Pamelor''', '''Norpress''', '''Allegron''', '''Noritren''' and '''Nortrilen'''. It is used in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] and childhood [[nocturnal enuresis]] (bedwetting). In addition, it is sometimes used for chronic illnesses such as [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[chronic pain]] and [[migraine]], and [[labile affect]] in some neurological conditions.

==Clinical pharmacology==

Nortriptyline is an active metabolite of [[amitriptyline]] that is demethylated in the liver. It inhibits the [[reuptake]] of [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and, to a lesser extent, [[serotonin]] with negligible effects on dopamine reuptake. Nortriptyline also has [[receptor antagonist|antagonistic]] effects at a variety of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s:

* Strong: [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]]
* Moderate: [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]], [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mACh]]
* Weak: [[5-HT1 receptor|5-HT<sub>1</sub>]]<ref name="Br J Pharmacol2007-Gillman">{{cite journal | author = Gillman PK | title = Tricyclic antidepressant pharmacology and therapeutic drug interactions updated | journal = Br J Pharmacol | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 737–48 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17471183 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707253 | pmc = 2014120}}</ref>

These effects account for some therapeutic actions as well as for most side effects such as [[sedation]], [[hypotension]], [[anticholinergic]] effects, etc. Nortriptyline may also have a sleep-improving effect due to its affinity for 5HT<sub>2A</sub> and histaminergic receptors.<ref name="Dialogues Clin Neurosci-Thase">{{cite journal | author = Thase ME | title = Depression and sleep: pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Dialogues Clin Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–26 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16889107 | pmc=3181772}}</ref> In the short run however, nortriptyline may disturb sleep due to its activating effect.

Like other tricyclic antidepressants, nortriptyline also [[channel blocker|blocks]] [[sodium channel]]s, possibly accounting in part for its analgesic action.

In one study of long-term efficacy, nortriptyline showed a higher relapse rate in comparison with phenelzine in individuals being treated for depression, possibly due to the metabolite 10-hydroxynortriptyline being produced.<ref name="pmid9074307">{{cite journal |author=Kennedy SH |title=Continuation and maintenance treatments in major depression: the neglected role of monoamine oxidase inhibitors |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=127–31 |year=1997 |month=March |pmid=9074307 |pmc=1188835 }}</ref> The authors of a review noted that the nortriptyline group had more episodes prior to treatment.<ref name="pmid9074307"/>

== Indications ==

Nortriptyline is FDA-approved for the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], it may also be used for treating [[nocturnal enuresis]], with courses of treatment lasting no more than three months. It is also used [[off-label use|off-label]] for the treatment of [[panic disorder]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[migraine]] prophylaxis and chronic pain or [[neuralgia]] modification, particularly [[temporomandibular joint disorder]].<ref name="Martindale2002-Sweetman">{{cite book | editor = Sweetman SC | title =Martindale.

=== Neuropathic pain ===

Although not approved by the FDA for [[neuropathic pain]], a large number of randomized controlled trials have proven the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of this condition in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. Recently, an evidence-based guideline sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Pain recommends nortriptyline as a first-line medication for neuropathic pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.4065/mcp.2009.0649|author=Robert H. Dworkin et al.  |title= Recommendations for the Pharmacological Management of Neuropathic Pain: An Overview and Literature Update |journal= Mayo Clinic Proceedings   |volume= 85 |issue= 3 |pages=S3–S14 |year= 2010 |pmid= 20194146|pmc=2844007 }}</ref>

== Metabolism ==

Nortriptyline is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. Approximately 7-10% of [[Caucasian race|caucasians]] are poor metabolizers and might experience more adverse effects, so a lower dosage is often necessary in these individuals.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.rxlist.com/pamelor-drug.htm | title = Pamelor (nortriptyline HCl) drug information | accessdate = 15 February 2010 }}</ref> Blood levels of nortriptyline should be obtained during long term treatment to avoid toxicity and optimize response.

== Dosage ==

For depression low starting doses are used, increasing as necessary to 75–100&nbsp;mg (0–50&nbsp;mg for adolescents and the elderly). Maximum daily dosage is 150&nbsp;mg.<ref name="BNF">[[British National Formulary]] '''45''' March 2003</ref>

For the management of nocturnal enuresis lower dosages are used with a maximum period of three months, followed by gradual withdrawal, and a full examination including [[electrocardiogram]] required before further courses.<ref name="BNF"/>

For its off-label use for migraine and headache prophylaxis and treating chronic pain treatment is started at very low 10&nbsp;mg once at night to minimize side-effects. The dose is then increased every two weeks if required to a maximum of 150&nbsp;mg. 

Dosage availability is 10&nbsp;mg, 25&nbsp;mg, 50&nbsp;mg, and 75&nbsp;mg capsules (Sandoz/Mallinckrodt Pharm).

== Side effects ==

The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, and increased appetite, mild blurred vision, tinnitus, often euphoria and mania. An occasional side effect is a rapid or [[irregular heartbeat]]. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects and should be avoided.

However, the incidence of side effects with nortriptyline is lower than with the first-generation tricyclics (e.g., [[imipramine]] (Tofranil), [[amitriptyline]] (Elavil)). For this reason it is often used in elder patients instead of other TCAs to reduce side effects and improving patient's compliance.

A study with men has found that treatment with nortriptyline is associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation compared to [[escitalopram]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/1741-7015-7-60}}</ref>

== Warnings ==

Closer monitoring is required for those with a history of cardiovascular disease, [[stroke]], [[glaucoma]], or [[seizures]], as well as those that have [[hyperthyroidism]] or are receiving thyroid medication.

Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories of emotional disturbances or [[suicidal ideation]].

== Contraindications ==

Nortriptyline should not be used in the acute recovery phase after [[myocardial infarction]] (e.g., heart attack). As for all tricyclic antidepressants, concurrent use, or failure to allow a two-week gap with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAO inhibitors, e.g., [[phenelzine]], [[tranylcypromine]], etc.) may precipitate [[hyperthermia|hyperpyretic]] crisis caused by [[serotonin syndrome]] or severe [[convulsion]]s.

== Overdose ==

{{main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants. As tricyclic antidepressants have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, the likelihood of overdose (both accidental and intentional) is fairly high and should be considered carefully by the prescribing physician prior to patient use.
