It was the first [[medical research]] charity in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was renamed the Jenner Institute (after [[Edward Jenner]] the pioneer of smallpox vaccine) in 1898 and then, in 1903, as the Lister Institute in honour of the great surgeon and medical pioneer, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Dr Joseph Lister]]. In 1905, the institute became a School of the [[University of London]].<ref name = "Linst">{{cite web|url=http://www.lister-institute.org.uk/scientificheritage.html |title=Lister Institute website, accessed 7 January 2012 |publisher=Lister-institute.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>

==History==
Until the 1970s the Institute maintained laboratories and conducted research on infectious disease and vaccines. It was funded by manufacturing and selling vaccines.

In the 1970s the Institute ran into financial difficulties. It had continual annual deficits, plus the need for major expenditure to modernise the [[Elstree]], [[Hertfordshire]], production facilities.  Professor [[Albert Neuberger]] became involved as chair of governing body in 1973-74, at which point he became aware of the difficult financial problems.<ref name="Marshall">{{cite web|title = Transcript of Prof. Albert Neuberger in conversation with Prof. Robin Marshall and Dr. George Tait, December 1989, with link to download option - subscription based. Covers his involvement with the Institute|url = http://jiscmediahub.ac.uk/record/display/012-00002668|accessdate = 27 January 2012}}</ref> The endowment funds were insufficient to cover their requirements and it failed to get Government support. Neuberger came to the conclusion that within five to six years it would be bankrupt and he persuaded colleagues to dissolve the Institute. He persuaded [[Westminster]] Council to change the use of buildings. The [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] laboratories were closed in 1975 and Elstree in 1978. The assets were sold, the most valuable being the Chelsea site.  

This raised enough money to annually endow a number of Senior Research Fellowships,<ref name = "LIPM website">{{cite web|url=http://www.lister-institute.org.uk/scientificheritage.html |title=Website describing reasons for 1970s change of direction |publisher=Lister-institute.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> which is the Institute's legacy. From that point it became a [[Funding of science|science funding body]], and it now awards the Lister Institute Research Prize Fellowships to researchers working on infectious disease in the United Kingdom. The Institute's assets in 2010 amounted to about £33m.<ref name = "RegOfChar">{{cite web|title = Register of Charities =http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=206271&SubsidiaryNumber=0|accessdate = 27 January 2012}}</ref>

==Achievements==
Staff took considerable risks in early research: investigating [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in [[India]] in the early 20th century the method of transmission was established when a female worker put her hand into a flea cage and saw how high the fleas jumped.<ref name = "BMJ">{{cite web|author=Jonathan Chick |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d8209 |title="War on Disease - A History of the Lister Institute" - review in the '&#39;British Medical Journal'&#39; 1971, accessed 7 January 2012 |publisher=Bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> Joseph Arkwright (great grandson of [[Richard Arkwright]]) joined the institute in 1906 and studied [[typhus]] by allowing himself to be bitten by infected lice. He survived, two others did not.<ref name = "BMJ"/>  Other major achievements include:

=== Prior to the First World War ===
These included the physiology of diving; the lethal effect of ultraviolet light on bacteria; fat metabolism; the role of [[vitamin]]s in nutrition (the term 'vitamine' was coined by [[Casimir Funk]] when working at the institute).<ref name = "Linst"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Biographies/Funk-Casimir.html |title=FAQ website - biographies, accessed 7 January 2012 |publisher=Faqs.org |date=1967-11-20 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref> The Institute's director from 1003, [[Charles James Martin (scientist)|Sir Charles Martin FRS FRCS]], made outstanding contributions to the study of plague and its transmission.

=== First World War ===
[[Tetanus]] [[antiserum]] production at Elstree was increased.  The bacteria causing [[gas gangrene]] of infected wounds were identified.

=== Inter-war years ===
The discovery of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|co-enzymes]] by [[Arthur Harden|Sir Authur Harden FRS]] and his colleagues winning him a share of a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1929. The institute played a major part in defining the role of vitamins in post-war nutritional deficiency diseases that were widespread in Europe and elsewhere. [[Emmy Klieneberger-Nobel]] pioneered the study of [[mycoplasma]] and in 1935 discovered and cultured unusual strains of bacteria that lacked a cell wall, naming them [[L-form bacteria]] after the institute where she worked.<ref>{{cite web|title =Two early ‘general microbiologists Microbiology Today |date=August 2005|url = http://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/080508.pdf|accessdate = 8 January 2012}}</ref>

=== Second World War ===
The war made heavy demands on the Lister for production of antisera and vaccines. There was also need for expertise in nutrition.

=== Post war to 1970s ===
The institute took some time to settle after wartime upheaval. In 1952 Ashley Miles was appointed as director. The institute remained an important manufacturer of vaccines and antitoxins. It produced the 'triple vaccine' for [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]] and [[pertussis]] (commonly called whooping cough) and vaccines for [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], [[rabies vaccines]] and smallpox. It also produced antisera for [[diphtheria]], tetanus, gas gangrene, rabies and [[scorpion]] venom. There were also further important research activities:

==Locations==
=== Elstree ===
The old Elstree site is located off the north-west side of Dagger Lane, off Tylers Way, [[Bushey]], between the Hillfield Park and Aldenham reservoirs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hertsdirect.org/maps/Website/WebMaps/viewer.htm?E=516822&N=195982&label=Aldenham%20Country%20Park&layers=os4km |title=Location map of Elstree site, accessed 21 January 2012 |publisher=Hertsdirect.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> in [[Aldenham Country Park]]. It was until recently shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps as the Lister Institute, though more recently the Master Atlas of Greater London (2007) shows it as 'laboratories'. Many of the original buildings still exist including one of the old lodges (Queensbury) and the old stable block. The site now houses the [[Bio Products Laboratory]], formed in 1954, which is the UK national [[Blood plasma fractionation|plasma fractionator]].

=== Chelsea ===
The British Institute of Preventative Medicine was established in 1891. This building, along with another adjacent building, forms what is now the private [[Lister Hospital (Chelsea)|Lister Hospital]], which opened in 1985. The [[Grade II]] [[Listed building]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-209130-lister-institute-of-preventative-medicin |title=Lister Institute of Preventative Medicine, Westminster |accessdate=6 February 2012 |publisher=British Listed Buildings }}</ref> is located on Chelsea Bridge Road at its junction with Grosvenor Road and [[Chelsea Bridge]] on the north bank of the [[River Thames]] which it overlooks.
