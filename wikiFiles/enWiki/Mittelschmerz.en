'''''Mittelschmerz''''' ([[German language|German]]: "middle [[pain]]") is a [[medicine|medical]] term for "ovulation pain" or "midcycle pain". About 20% of women experience mittelschmerz, some every cycle, some intermittently.

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Mittelschmerz is characterized by lower [[abdominal]] and [[human pelvis|pelvic]] pain that occurs roughly midway through a woman's [[menstrual cycle]]. The pain can appear suddenly and usually subsides within hours, although it may sometimes last two or three days.<!--

In some women, the mittelschmerz is localized enough so that they can tell which of their two [[Ovary|ovaries]] provided the egg in a given month{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}.  Because ovulation occurs on a random ovary each cycle, the pain may switch sides or stay on the same side from one cycle to another.

Diagnosis of mittelschmerz is generally made if a woman is mid-cycle and a pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. If the pain is prolonged and/or severe, other diagnostic procedures such as an abdominal [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may be performed to rule out other causes of abdominal pain.

The pain of mittelschmerz is sometimes mistaken for [[appendicitis]] and is one of the [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]] for appendicitis in women of child-bearing age.

==Treatment==
The pain is not harmful and does not signify the presence of disease. No treatment is usually necessary. Pain relievers ([[analgesic]]s) may be needed in cases of prolonged or intense pain.<ref name=adam>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002472/</ref>

[[Hormonal contraception|Hormonal forms of contraception]] can be taken to prevent ovulation<ref name=adam /> -- and therefore ovulatory pain -- but otherwise there is no known prevention.

==Causes==
Mittelschmerz is believed to have a variety of causes:

*'''Follicular swelling:''' The swelling of follicles in the ovaries prior to [[ovulation]].  While only one or two eggs mature to the point of being released, a number of follicles grows during the [[Menstrual cycle#Follicular phase|follicular phase]] of the menstrual cycle (non-dominant follicles atrophy prior to ovulation).  Because follicles develop on both sides, this theory explains mittelschmerz that occurs simultaneously on both sides of the abdomen.<!--

*'''Ovarian wall rupture:''' The ovaries have no openings; at ovulation the egg breaks through the ovary's wall.  This may make ovulation itself painful for some women.<ref name="tcoyf" />

*'''Fallopian tube contraction:''' After ovulation, the [[fallopian tube]]s contract (similar to [[peristalsis]] of the esophagus), which may cause pain in some women.<ref name="kippley" />

*'''Smooth muscle cell contraction:''' At ovulation, this pain may be related to smooth muscle cell contraction in the ovary as well as in its ligaments.  These contractions occur in response to an increased level of prostaglandin F2-alpha, itself mediated by the surge of luteinizing hormone (LH).<!--

*'''Irritation:''' At the time of ovulation, [[blood]] or other [[Bodily fluid|fluid]] is released from the ruptured egg follicle. This fluid may cause irritation of the abdominal lining.<ref name="kippley" /><ref name="tcoyf" />

==Usefulness==
Women charting with some form of [[fertility awareness]] may find mittelschmerz to be a helpful secondary sign in detecting ovulation.  Because normal sperm life is up to five days, however, mittelschmerz alone does not provide sufficient advance warning to avoid pregnancy.  Because other causes of minor abdominal pain are common, mittelschmerz alone also cannot be used to confirm the beginning of the post-ovulatory infertile period.<ref name="kippley" /><ref name="tcoyf" />

==Other ovulation symptoms==
Women may notice other physical symptoms associated with their mittelschmerz, during or near ovulation.  The most common sign is the appearance of fertile cervical mucus in the days leading up to ovulation.  Cervical mucus is one of the primary signs used by various fertility awareness methods.  Other symptoms are sometimes called ''secondary fertility signs'' to distinguish from the [[Fertility_awareness#Primary_signs|three primary signs]].<ref name="tcoyf" />

* Mid-cycle or ovulatory bleeding is thought to result from the sudden drop in estrogen that occurs just before ovulation.  This drop in hormones can trigger withdrawal bleeding in the same way that switching from active to placebo [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]] does.  The rise in hormones that occurs after ovulation prevents such mid-cycle spotting from becoming as heavy or long lasting as a typical menstruation.  Spotting is more common in longer cycles.<ref name="tcoyf" />

* A woman's [[vulva]] may swell just prior to ovulation, especially the side on which ovulation will occur.<ref name="tcoyf" />

* One of the groin lymph nodes (on the side on which ovulation will occur) will swell to about the size of a pea, and may become tender.<ref name="tcoyf" />
