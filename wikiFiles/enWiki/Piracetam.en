'''Piracetam''' (sold under many brand names) is a [[nootropic]]. Piracetam's chemical name is 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide; it shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with [[2-oxo-pyrrolidine carboxylic acid]] ([[pyroglutamate]]). Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of [[GABA]]. It is one of the group of [[racetam]]s. Piracetam is prescribed by doctors for some conditions, mainly [[myoclonus]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100001864.html |title=Nootropil |publisher=NetDoctor.co.uk |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> but is [[Off-label use|used off-label]] for a much wider range of applications.

Popular trade names for Piracetam in Europe are "Nootropil" and "Lucetam", among many others. In Argentina, it is made by GlaxoSmithKline S.A. laboratories and sold under the trade name of "Noostan" (800&nbsp;mg or 1200&nbsp;mg). In Venezuela and Ecuador, Piracetam is produced by Laboratorios Farma S.A. and sold under the brand name of "Breinox".

==Effects==

There is very little data on piracetam's effect on healthy people, with most studies focusing on people with seizures, dementia, concussions, or other neurological problems. A two-week regimen of piracetam was reported in 1976 to enhance [[verbal memory]] in healthy college students in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=826948 |year=1976 |last1=Dimond |first1=SJ |last2=Brouwers |title=Increase in the power of human memory in normal man through the use of drugs |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=307–9 |journal=Psychopharmacology |doi=10.1007/BF00426834 |first2=EM}}</ref>

Several meta-reviews of literature on piracetam indicate that piracetam increases performance on a variety of cognitive tasks among dyslexic children, though this may reflect its enhancement of cross-hemispheric communication and of cognitive function in general, rather than a specific improvement in whatever causes [[dyslexia]]. Piracetam also seems to inhibit brain damage caused by a variety of factors including [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and excessive alcohol consumption.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=11226810 |year=2001 |last1=Vaglenova |first1=J |last2=Vesselinov Petkov |title=Can nootropic drugs be effective against the impact of ethanol teratogenicity on cognitive performance? |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–40 |journal=[[European Neuropsychopharmacology]] : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology |first2=V|doi=10.1016/S0924-977X(00)00129-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=12164545 |year=2002 |last1=Gabryel |first1=B |first2=M |last2=Adamek |last3=Pudełko |first3=A |last4=Małecki |first4=A |last5=Trzeciak |first5=HI |title=Piracetam and vinpocetine exert cytoprotective activity and prevent apoptosis of astrocytes in vitro in hypoxia and reoxygenation |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |journal=Neurotoxicology |doi=10.1016/S0161-813X(02)00004-9}}</ref>

Piracetam possesses pronounced antihypoxic and antiarrhythmic effect; the latter is carried out by decreasing the rhythm rate and increasing the contraction amplitude. The animals treated with piracetam in a dose when its antiarrhythmic effects (300&nbsp;mg/kg) exhibited a decrease of the membrane potential of erythrocytes as compared with control. Similar effects occurred in the animals treated with lidocaine. It can be concluded that in certain types of arrhythmias the use of piracetam restores the normal rhythm of contractions that is perhaps connected with its positive influence on metabolic processes in the myocardium.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=2081561 |year=1990 |last1= Samvelian |last2= Malakian |last3= Badzhinian |title=Nekotorye aspekty antiaritmicheskogo deĭstviia piratsetama |trans_title=The antiarrhythmic action of piracetam |journal=Farmakologiia i toksikologiia |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=22–3 |first1=VM |first2=MG |first3=SA|language=Russian }}</ref>

==Mechanisms of action==
Piracetam's mechanism of action, as with [[racetams]] in general, is not fully understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant.<ref name=Winblad2005/> Piracetam is a positive [[allosteric modulator]] of the [[AMPA receptor]].<ref name=ahmedoswald>{{Cite journal| doi=10.1021/jm901905j| year=2010 |last1=Ahmed |first1=A |last2=Oswald| first2=R |title=Piracetam Defines a New Binding Site for Allosteric Modulators of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors |journal=J Med.

==History==
Piracetam was first synthesized in 1964 by scientists at the Belgian pharmaceutical company [[UCB (company)|UCB]] led by Dr [[Corneliu E. Giurgea]]; struck by its apparent ability to boost mental functioning in even healthy individuals and by its safety, Giurgea coined the term [[nootropic]] to describe it and other substances. Piracetam (trade name "Nootropil") was launched clinically by UCB in the early 1970s, and currently is in use in many European countries.<ref>

==Approval and usage==
Piracetam is primarily used in Europe, Asia, South America and the U.S. Piracetam is legal to import into the United Kingdom for personal use with or without prescription, and was unregulated in the United States, as of 2006.<ref>http://www.medic8.com/medicines/Piracetam.html</ref> However, in August 2010, the FDA issued a single letter to one supplier ordering the discontinuation of the sale of Piracetam in the U.S. as a dietary supplement owing to the relatively strict definition of what constitutes a dietary supplement. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1): Piracetam is not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, or dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Further, piracetam is not a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any such dietary ingredient.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm225605.htm FDA Warning Letter, August 30, 2010] Retrieved 2011-3-2</ref> As of April 2011, Piracetam continues to be widely available online and in some shops in the United States, but is no longer marketed as a dietary supplement. Piracetam has no DIN in Canada, and thus cannot be sold but can be imported for personal use in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It has become popular as a cognitive enhancement drug among students.<ref>"''I would say a lot of students are using that now,'' he said.

===Dyspraxia and dysgraphia===
Due to its supposed effect on nerves and muscles it is sometimes prescribed as an aid to muscle or dexterity training, particularly in cases of [[agraphia]] and [[dyspraxia]]. There has not been a specific study as to whether it is beneficial in this. [[Vinpocetine]], another purported [[nootropic]] with which piracetam is indirectly synergistic, is confirmed to help with these conditions to a certain degree.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Schizophrenia===
At least one study shows that, while piracetam positively affected the [[cognition]] of patients suffering from [[schizophrenia]] in the same way as it positively affected the cognition of others, the severity of subjects' schizophrenia remained unaffected, for better or worse.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00427522 |title=Some effects of piracetam (UCB 6215 nootropyl) on chronic schizophrenia |year=1979 |last1=Dimond |first1=Stuart J. |last2=Scammell |last3=Pryce |last4=Huws |last5=Gray |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=64 |pages=341–8 |pmid=116278 |first2=RE |first3=IG |first4=D |first5=C |issue=3}}</ref>

===Preventive for breath-holding spells===
Two articles support the use of Piracetam as a [[prophylactic]] for severe cases of [[breath-holding spells]]. A 2008 study in the International Journal of Psychiatry Medicine supported the notion that Piracetam was effective as a preventive, but did not use a [[Scientific_control#Necessity_of_controls|control]] to evaluate results against normal recovery times from severe BHS.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Azam M, Bhatti N, Shahab N |title=Piracetam in severe breath holding spells |journal=Int J Psychiatry Med |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=195–201 |year=2008 |pmid=18724570 |doi= 10.2190/PM.38.2.f|url=}}</ref> A 1998 study by the Turkish ministry of health evaluated 76 children, half of them in a control group. Children in the experimental group were three times as, and almost completely likely, to exhibit "overall control" over their BHS, with BHS episodes dropping by 60% over two months.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Donma MM |title=Clinical efficacy of piracetam in treatment of breath-holding spells |journal=Pediatr.

The 2008 study notes: {{quote| Breath holding spells (BHS) are apparently frightening events occurring in otherwise healthy children. Generally, no medical treatment is recommended and parental reassurance is believed to be enough, however, severe BHS can be very stressful for the parents and a pharmacological agent may be desired in some of these children.}}

===Closed craniocerebral trauma===
Piracetam has positive therapeutic effects on adolescents with closed craniocerebral trauma (CCT). Treatment with piracetam was initiated 1.5 to 5 years after trauma. Compared to controls, after one month of daily treatment with 1600–2400&nbsp;mg of piracetam there were meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the higher mental functions (visual memory, attention and executive), motor functions (gait, balance and sequential limb movements) and in the rates of cognitive and motor operations.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=19340573 |doi=10.1007/s11055-009-9146-2 |year=2009 |last1=Zavadenko |first1=NN |last2=Guzilova |title=Sequelae of closed craniocerebral trauma and the efficacy of piracetam in its treatment in adolescents |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=323–8 |journal=Neuroscience and Behavioral Physiology |first2=LS}}</ref>

==Dosage==
For blood coagulation, clotting, and vasospastic disorders such as [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] or [[deep-vein thrombosis]], the most effective treatment range is a daily dose of 4.8 to 9.6&nbsp;grams divided into three daily doses at 8 hours apart.<ref name=novel /><ref name=raynaud /><ref name=rheo /> Many people take a dosage of 800&nbsp;mg twice per day to improve cognition.<ref>http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/24146-best-attack-dose-for-piracetam/</ref> The [[LD-50]] for oral consumption in humans has not been determined.<ref name=noot />

==Side effects==
Piracetam has been found to have very few side effects, and those it has are typically "few, mild, and transient."<ref name=sympt>{{Cite journal|pmid=9527146 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.64.3.344 |pmc=2169975 |year=1998 |last1=Koskiniemi |first1=M |last2=Van Vleymen |last3=Hakamies |last4=Lamusuo |last5=Taalas |title=Piracetam relieves symptoms in progressive myoclonus epilepsy: a multicentre, randomised, double blind, crossover study comparing the efficacy and safety of three dosages of oral piracetam with placebo |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=344–8 |journal=Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry |first2=B |first3=L |first4=S |first5=J}}</ref> A large-scale, 12-week trial of high-dose piracetam found no adverse effects occurred in the group taking piracetam as compared to the [[placebo]] group.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=10338106 |year=1999 |last1=De Reuck |first1=J |last2=Van Vleymen |title=The clinical safety of high-dose piracetam--its use in the treatment of acute stroke |volume=32 Suppl 1 |pages=33–7 |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |first2=B |doi=10.1055/s-2007-979234}}</ref> Many other studies have likewise found piracetam to be well tolerated.<ref name="ReferenceC"/><ref name=sympt /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Giurgea |first1=C. |last2=Salama |first2=M. |title=Nootropic drugs |journal=Prog Neuro-Psychopharmacolgy |volume=1 |year=1977 |pages=235–247 |doi=10.1016/0364-7722(77)90046-7|issue=3–4}}</ref>

==Piracetam and lucid dreaming==
Piracetam has become a popular supplement in the subculture of lucid dreaming. Its use has been largely made popular by a book published by "Thomas Yuschak" titled "Advanced Lucid Dreaming The Power of Supplements". Piracetam is not used directly to cause vivid dreams; it is even said to prevent them. The premise for its use is to counter the desensitization of acetylcholine receptors in the brain caused by taking another supplement, [[Galantamine]], which is said to cause stronger, more vivid dreaming experiences. Piracetam is taken immediately after having a lucid dream experience with Galantamine. The lucid dreamer will then not take the supplement combination again until the Galantamine has completely left their system (approximately 30 hours). Piracetam has a peak plasma time of 1.5 hours and an elimination half-life equal to 5 hours. For the purpose of lucid dreaming dosing is much lower than doses taken in clinical studies, averaging typically 2400 mg.

==Availability==
