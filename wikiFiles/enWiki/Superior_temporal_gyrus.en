The '''superior temporal gyrus''' is one of three (sometimes two) [[gyrus|gyri]] in the [[temporal lobe]] of the human [[brain]], which is located laterally to the head, situated somewhat above the external ear.

The superior temporal gyrus is bounded by:
* the [[lateral sulcus]] above;
* the [[superior temporal sulcus]] (not always present or visible) below;
* an imaginary line drawn from the [[preoccipital notch]] to the [[lateral sulcus]] [[Posterior (anatomy)|posteriorly]].

The superior temporal gyrus contains several important structures of the [[brain]], including:
* [[Brodmann area]]s 41 and 42, marking the location of the [[primary auditory cortex]], the [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] region responsible for the sensation of [[sound]];
* [[Wernicke's area]], Brodmann 22p, an important region for the processing of [[Speech communication|speech]] so that it can be understood as language.

The superior temporal gyrus contains the primary auditory cortex, which is responsible for processing sounds. Specific sound frequencies map precisely onto the primary auditory cortex. This auditory (or tonotopic) map is similar to the homunculus map of the primary motor cortex. Some areas of the superior temporal gyrus are specialized for processing combinations of frequencies, and other areas are specialized for processing changes in amplitude or frequency. The superior temporal gyrus also includes the Wernicke's area, which (in most people) is located in the left hemisphere. It is the major area involved in the comprehension of language. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) is involved in auditory processing, including language, but also has been implicated as a critical structure in social cognition. <ref>Erin D.

==Function==
The superior temporal gyrus has been involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli.<ref name=radua2010>

The superior temporal gyrus has been discovered to be an important structure in the pathway consisting of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which are all involved in social cognition processes. <ref>Adolphs, 2003 ; Takahashi et al., 2004</ref> <ref> Bigler, E. et al.
