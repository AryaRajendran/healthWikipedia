==History==
Examination of ancient remains has led to the suggestion that yaws has affected [[Hominidae|hominid]]s for the last 1.5 million years. The current name is believed to be of [[Carib people|Carib]] origin, "yaya" meaning sore.<ref name=MedicineNet>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/yaws/page4.htm|title=Yaws|accessdate=5 August 2012|authors=Davis, Charles Patrick; Stoppler, Melissa Conrad|publisher=MedicineNet.com}}</ref> It is believed to have originated in tropical areas of Africa, and spread to other tropical areas of the world via immigration and slave trade.

==Epidemiology==
Yaws is found in humid tropical regions in [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Mass treatment campaigns in the 1950s reduced the worldwide [[prevalence]] from 50–150 million to fewer than 2.5 million; however during the 1970s there were outbreaks in [[south-east Asia]] and there have been continued sporadic cases in [[South America]]. It is unclear how many people worldwide are infected at present.<ref name=Capuano2011/>

About three quarters of people affected are children under 15 years of age, with the greatest incidence in children 6–10 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs316/en/ |title=Yaws |work=WHO Fact sheet |accessdate=2012-10-16}}.</ref>

==Presentation==
The disease is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact with an infective lesion, with the bacterium entering through a pre-existing cut, bite or scratch. Within ninety days (but usually less than a month) of infection a painless but distinctive "mother yaw" appears, which is a painless [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]] which enlarges and becomes warty in appearance. Sometimes nearby "daughter yaws" also appear simultaneously. This primary stage resolves completely within six months. The secondary stage occurs months to years later, and is characterised by widespread skin lesions of varying appearance, including "crab yaws" on the palms and soles with [[desquamation]]. These secondary lesions frequently ulcerate (and are then highly infectious), but heal after six months or more. About ten percent of people then go on to develop tertiary disease within five to ten years (during which further secondary lesions may come and go), characterised by widespread bone, joint and [[soft tissue]] destruction, which may include extensive destruction of the bone and cartilage of the nose (rhinopharyngitis mutilans or "gangosa").

==Diagnosis==
Most often the diagnosis is made clinically. [[Dark field microscopy]] of samples taken from early lesions (particularly ulcerative lesions) may show the responsible organism. Blood tests such as [[VDRL]], [[Rapid Plasma Reagin]] (RPR) and [[TPHA]] will also be positive, but there are no current blood tests which distinguish among the four [[treponematosis|treponematoses]].<ref name=MedicineNet/>

==Treatment==
Treatment is normally by a single [[intramuscular injection]] of [[penicillin]], or by a course of penicillin, [[erythromycin]] or [[tetracycline]] tablets. A single oral dose of [[azithromycin]] was shown to be as effective as intramuscular penicillin.<ref>{{cite pmid | 22240407}}</ref>  Primary and secondary stage lesions may heal completely, but the destructive changes of tertiary yaws are largely irreversible.

==Eradication efforts==

The global prevalence of this disease and the other endemic treponematoses, [[Nonvenereal endemic syphilis|bejel]] and [[Pinta (disease)|Pinta]], was reduced by the Global Control of Treponematoses (TCP) programme between 1952 and 1964 from about 50 to 150 million cases to about 2.5 million (a 95 percent reduction).  Following the cessation of this program yaws surveillance and treatment became a part of primary health systems of the affected countries. However incomplete eradication led to a resurgence of yaws in 1970s with the largest number of case found in the Western Africa region.<ref name=Capuano2011>{{cite journal|last=Capuano|first=Corinne|last2=Ozaki|first2=Masayo|title=Yaws in the Western Paciﬁc Region: A Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Tropical Medicine|year=2011|volume=2011|pages=642832|doi=10.1155/2011/642832|format=pdf|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253475/pdf/JTM2011-642832.pdf|pmc=3253475|pmid=22235208}}</ref><ref name=Rinaldi2008>{{cite journal |author=Rinaldi A  |title=Yaws: a second (and maybe last?) chance for eradication. |journal=[[PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=e275 |year=2008 |url=http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000275 |pmid=18846236 |accessdate= 2013-03-18 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000275}}</ref> 

Yaws is a relatively easy disease to eradicate. Humans are likely the only reservoir of infection.<ref name=Capuano2011/> A single injection of long-acting penicillin or other [[beta lactam]] antibiotic cures the disease and is widely available;<ref name=Asiedu2008/> and the disease is highly localised making case tracing relatively easy. 

In April 2012 WHO decided to start a new global campaign for eradication of yaws, which has been on the WHO eradication list since 2011. According to the official roadmap the elimination should be achieved by 2020.<ref name=Maurice2012>{{cite journal|last=Maurice|first=John|title=WHO plans new yaws eradication campaign|journal=The Lancet|year=2012|pages=1377–78|volume=379|url= http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60581-9/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60581-9}}</ref><ref name=Rinaldi2012>{{cite journal |author=Rinaldi A  |title=Yaws eradication: facing old problems, raising new hopes. |journal=[[PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases]] |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e18372 |year=2012 |url=http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0001837 |pmid=23209846 |accessdate= 2013-03-18 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001837}}</ref> So far, this appears to have met with some success, since no cases have been seen in India since 2004.<ref name=Asiedu2008>{{cite journal |author=Asiedu et al. |title=Yaws eradication: past efforts and future perspectives |journal=[[Bulletin of the World Health Organisation]] |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=499–500 |year=2008 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/7/08-055608/en/index.html |pmid=18670655 |accessdate= 2009-04-02 |doi=10.2471/BLT.08.055608 |last2=Amouzou |first2=B |last3=Dhariwal |first3=A |last4=Karam |first4=M |last5=Lobo |first5=D |last6=Patnaik |first6=S |last7=Meheus |first7=A |pmc=2647478}}</ref><ref>[http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Yaws_yaws.pdf WHO South-East Asia report of an intercountry workshop on Yaws eradication, 2006]</ref>

Certification for disease free status requires an absence of the disease for at least five years. In India this happened on 19 September 2011. In 1996 there were 3,571 yaws cases in India; in 1997 after a serious elimination effort began the number of cases fell to 735. By 2003 the number of cases were 46. The last clinical case in India was reported in 2003 and the last latent case in 2006.<ref name=Akbar2011>{{cite news|last=Akbar|first=Syed|title=Another milestone for India: Yaws eradication|date=7 August 2011|work=The Asian Age|accessdate=5 August 2012|url= http://www.asianage.com/health-fitness/another-milestone-india-yaws-eradication-116 }}</ref>
