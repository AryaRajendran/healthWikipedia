A '''Biomedical Equipment Technician/Technologist''', also referred to as a '''Biomedical Engineering Technician/Technologist (BMET)''' or '''Biomedical Equipment/Engineering Specialist (BES or BMES)''' is typically an electro-mechanical [[technician|technician or technologist]] who ensures that [[medical equipment]] is well-maintained, properly configured, and safely functional.  In hospital or clinical environments BMETs often work with [[Clinical Engineering|Clinical Engineers]], though as in most technical fields there is a professional and [[Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering|legal distinction]] between [[engineer]]s and engineering [[technician|technicians/technologists]].

BMETs are employed by hospitals, clinics, private sector companies, and the military. These persons install, inspect, maintain, repair, calibrate, modify and design biomedical equipment and support systems to adhere to medical standard guidelines. Biomeds are involved in the total management of healthcare technology beyond repairs and scheduled maintenance; such as, capitol asset planning, project management, budgeting and personnel management, designing interfaces and integrating medical systems, training end-users to utilize medical technology, and evaluating new devices for acquisition. BMETs educate and advise staff and other agencies on theory of operation, physiological principles, and safe clinical application of biomedical equipment maintaining the facility's patient care and medical staff equipment.

The acceptance of the BMET in the private sector was given a big push in 1970 when consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]] wrote an article in which he claimed, "At least 1,200 people a year are electrocuted and many more are killed or injured in needless electrical accidents in hospitals."

BMETs cover a vast array of different fields and devices. However, in many cases there is a separation of responsibilities whereby other (more specific) specialists focus on certain kinds of medical instruments -- i.e., an Imaging Repair Specialist works strictly on medical imaging equipment.    

Examples of different areas of Medical equipment technology are:
*Diagnostic Imaging:
**[[Radiography|Radiographic]] and [[Fluoroscopy|fluoroscopic]] X-ray,
**[[Diagnostic ultrasound]],
**[[Mammography]],
**[[Nuclear_medicine|Nuclear Imaging]],
**[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET),
**[[Medical imaging]], 
**[[Computed Tomography]] (CT), Linear [[Tomography]], 
**Picture archiving and communication systems ([[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]]),
**[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI scanner)
*Biomedical Technology
*Physiological monitoring
*Electron microscope,
*[[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]]
*LASERs,
*Dental
*Telemedicine
*[[Heart lung machine|Heart Lung Device]]
*[[da Vinci Surgical System|DaVinci Surgical Robot]],
*[[Optometry]]
*Surgical Instruments
*[[Infusion pump]]s, 
*Surgical instruments,
*[[Anesthesia]],
*Laboratory,
*Dialysis,
*Respiratory Services (ventilators)
*Computer Networking Systems integration,
*Information Technology,
*Patient Monitoring
*Cardiac Diagnostics

BMETs work closely with nursing staff, and [[Medical Material]] personnel to obtain parts, supplies, and equipment and even closer with [[facility management]] to coordinate equipment installations requiring certain facility requirements/modifications.

== Regulatory issues ==
BMETs must conform with safety regulations, and most biomedical systems must have documentation to show that they were managed, modified, tested, delivered, and used according to a planned, approved process that increases the quality and safety of diagnostics and therapeutic equipment and reduces the risk of harm to patients and staff.

In the United States, BMETs may operate under various regulatory frameworks. Clinical devices and technologies are generally governed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) particularly NFPA 99 and chapter 7, NFPA 70, Life Safety Code 101, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, The Joint Commission (TJC) hospital or Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care standards; and ensures compliance with these codes and standards for the US government registry of biomedical devices.

Other countries typically have their own mechanisms for regulation.

== Biomedical equipment technology training ==
Traditionally, biomedical equipment technology has been an interdisciplinary field to specialize in after completing an Associate degree in Biomedical Equipment Technology, Biomedical Electronics Technology, or Biomedical Engineering Technology. Some BMETs get their training through the military.

Most entry-level BMETs enter into the field with a 2-year associate's degree in biomedical equipment technology, or they spend about one year in full-time military training. A 4-year graduate is often also a Health Technology Management (HTM) professional who can perform similar [[medical equipment management]] duties as a [[clinical engineering|clinical engineer]] or BMET Manager. Practical experience is gained through internships. Continuing education is typically provided by specific medical device manufacturers. BMET educational degree programs can be accredited by the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) or the ATMAE (Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering) both of whom offer specialised/programmatic accreditation for BMET programs.  In addition, many 4 year graduates from accredited programs have studied or go on to study [[Biomedical Engineering]], more specifically [[Clinical Engineering]], if they wish to perform research and/or design (or MBA programs, if they wish to work on the business or administrative side).

== Professional certification ==
Many BMETs pursue professional certification, such as satisfying certain education requirements and passing an examination from the International Certification Commission (ICC) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) to become a certified biomedical equipment technician (CBET), that is an accomplished generalized certification in the field covering many facets. There are three other certifications BMETs can obtain such as: Certified Radiology Equipment Specialists (CRES) that specializes more specifically in diagnostic imaging, radiological, and nuclear medicine equipment, Certified Laboratory Equipment Specialists (CLES) that covers the abundance of equipment found in the many different kinds of laboratory environments, and even the less well known Certified Nephrology Equipment Specialist (CNES) that specifically specializes in nephrology and hemodialysis equipment. One can also choose to obtain the Biomedical Electronics Technician certification (BMD) from the Electronics Technician Association (ETA) after first obtaining the Associate Electronics Technician certification (CET). In most cases, carrying the title of "CBET" is highly encouraged, not mandatory, and is respected within the technical community.

== Employment ==
BMETs work in the hospital's Biomedical or Clinical Engineering Department, but can also find employment with a third-party independent service organization (ISO) or original equipment manufacturer ([[OEM]]).

BMETs working for an [[OEM]] or ISO are many times called Field Service Engineers (FSE). FSE are more narrowly focused and specialized technicians who support Service and Sales.

All military members entering the BMET career field receive comprehensive technical training. Prior to 1998, Army and Navy BMETs received training at the United States Army Equipment and Optical School (USAMEOS) at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (FAMC) in Aurora, Colorado. Only after a July 1995 Base Realignment Closure Commission decided to close FAMC did the Army and Navy merge with the Air Force, conducting training at the [http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/bmet/ DoD Biomedical Equipment Technician Training School]. This school has a partnership with Aims Community College where students receive 81 quarter credits (from the Community College of the Air Force) toward an Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) Degree with an emphasis in Biomedical Electronic Technology. In addition to the credits acquired from DoD BMET Training School, a minimum of 24 credits must be completed through [http://www.aimsced.com/biomed.htm Aims Community College] to receive a degree. As of August 4, 2010, the U. S. Military moved the BMET training to San Antonio, TX as a part of their new base realignment plan. All three forces remain in rigorous, tri-service training for 10 months prior to returning to their individual services. The training is held at Fort Sam Houstion and is a part of the Military Education and Training Campus.
