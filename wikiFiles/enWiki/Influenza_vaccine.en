=== Deadly epidemics each winter ===

An influenza epidemic emerges during [[flu season]] each winter. There are two flu seasons annually, corresponding to the occurrence of winter in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (winter in one hemisphere is at the same time as summer in the other).

Although difficult to assess, these annual epidemics are thought to result in between three and five million cases of severe illness and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths every year around the world.<ref name="WHO Influenza Overview">[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/ WHO Influenza Overview]</ref> Tens of thousands of Americans die in a typical flu season, but there are notable variations from year to year. In 2010 the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the United States changed the way it reports the 30-year estimates for deaths from influenza. They are reported as a range from a low of about 3,300 deaths to a high of 49,000 per year over the past 30 years.<ref name="pmid20798667">{{cite journal | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)| title = Estimates of deaths associated with seasonal influenza --- United States, 1976-2007| journal = [[MMWR Morb.

Within its blanket recommendation for general vaccination in the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), who began recommending the influenza vaccine to health care workers in 1981, emphasizes to clinicians the special urgency of vaccination for members of certain vulnerable groups, and their [[caregivers]]:

Influenza vaccine has been demonstrated to prevent disease and death, both in numerous controlled studies and in painstaking scientific reviews of these studies.

For healthy, working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, but such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Evidence for protection in adults aged 65 years or older is lacking. New vaccines with improved [[Intrinsic activity|clinical efficacy]] and effectiveness are needed to further reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Osterholm MT, Kelley NS, Sommer A, Belongia EA. |title=Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=Lancet Infect Dis. |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=36–44 |year=2012 |month= |pmid=22032844 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(11)70295-X}}</ref>

Influenza vaccination has been shown highly effective in [[health care workers]] (HCW), with minimal adverse effects. In a study of forty matched nursing homes, staff influenza vaccination rates were 69.9% in the vaccination arm versus 31.8% in the control arm. The vaccinated staff experienced a 42% reduction in sick leave from work (P=.03).<ref>{{cite pmid|19682118}}</ref> A review of eighteen studies likewise found a strong net benefit to health care workers.<ref name=pmid16546308>{{cite pmid|16546308}}</ref>  Of these eighteen HCW studies, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of health care worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths.<ref name=pmid16546308 /> An analysis of data and patient population health in New Mexico's 75 long-term care facilities nursing homes found that as vaccination rates of health care personnel with direct patient contact rose from 51 to 75&nbsp;percent, the chances of a flu outbreak among patients in that facility went down by 87&nbsp;percent. The New Mexico study showed that vaccinating health care personnel provided more protection to residents than vaccinating the residents themselves.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wendelboe AM, Avery C, Andrade B, Baumbach J, Landen MG |title=Importance of employee vaccination against influenza in preventing cases in long-term care facilities |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=990–7 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21931249 |doi=10.1086/661916}}</ref>

A 2011 meta-study published in the journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', "Efficacy and Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccines," analyzed 31 prior studies on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination trials conducted between 1967 and 2011. The analysis found that flu shots were efficacious 67&nbsp;percent of the time; the populations that benefited the most were HIV-positive adults ages 18 to 55 (76&nbsp;percent), healthy adults ages 18 to 46 (approximately 70&nbsp;percent) and healthy children ages 6 to 24 months (66&nbsp;percent).<ref name="Osterholm">{{Cite journal| last1 = Osterholm | first1 = MT| last2 = Kelley | first2 = NS| last3 = Sommer | first3 = A| last4 = Belongia | first4 = EA| title = Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines: A systematic review and meta-analysis| doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(11)70295-X| journal = The Lancet Infectious Diseases| volume = 12| issue = 1| pages = 36–44| year = 2012| pmid =  22032844| pmc =}} Also discussed in {{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/federalstate/influenza-flu-vaccines-review-meta-analysis/|title=Efficacy and Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccines: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved February 2, 2012</ref>

The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, is also the least to benefit from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70236-0 | last1 = Simonsen | first1 = L. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = R.J. | last3 = Viboud | first3 = C. | last4 = Miller | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Jackson | first5 = L.A. | year = 2007 | title = Mortality benefits of influenza vaccination in elderly people: An ongoing controversy | url = | journal = The Lancet Infectious Diseases | volume = 7 | issue = 10| pages = 658–666 | pmid = 17897608 }}</ref> In a non-pandemic year, a person in the United States aged 50–64 is nearly ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than a younger person, and a person over age 65 is over ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than the 50–64 age group.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Thompson WW, Shay DK, Weintraub E, Brammer L, Cox N, Anderson LJ, Fukuda K | title=Mortality associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in the United States | journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume=289 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=179–186 | pmid=12517228 | doi=10.1001/jama.289.2.179}}</ref> 

As mortality is also high among infants who contract influenza, the household contacts and caregivers of infants should be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant.<ref name="WHO Fact Sheet" /> Data from the years when Japan required annual [http://www.bizhealth.com.au/flu-vaccinations/ flu vaccinations] for school-aged children indicate that vaccinating children—the group most likely to catch and spread the disease—has a strikingly positive effect on reducing mortality among older people, due to [[herd immunity]]: one life saved for every 420 children who received the flu vaccine.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/344/12/889 NEJM - The Japanese Experience with Vaccinating Schoolchildren against Influenza<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, a 2010 Cochrane review found that the same benefit did not extend to vaccinating health care workers working with elderly patients in long-term care facilities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thomas RE, Jefferson T, Lasserson TJ |title=Influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who work with the elderly |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD005187 |year=2010 |pmid=20166073 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005187.pub3}}</ref> In working adults, by contrast, Cochrane found that vaccination reduced both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications.<ref name="pmid20614424">{{cite journal |author=Jefferson T, Di Pietrantonj C, Rivetti A, Bawazeer GA, Al-Ansary LA, Ferroni E |title=Vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=7 |pages=CD001269 |year=2010 |pmid=20614424 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001269.pub4}}</ref>

===Duration of protection===
According to work published in 1973, 1983, and 2004, after vaccination against seasonal flu, antibody titres peak after typically two to four weeks. They decrease by about 50% over the next six months (the decrease is less for older adults), then remain stable for two to three years; protection without revaccination persists for at least three years for children and young adults.<ref>[http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/Documents/DurationAntibody_Protection09-08-09_b.ppt Duration of Serum Antibody Response to Seasonal Influenza Vaccines: Summary, presentation citing references]</ref>

It was previously thought that vaccination provided lifelong protection against specific strains.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/01/weekinreview/ideas-trends-flu-some-answers-but-not-the-answer.html New York Times: IDEAS & TRENDS; Flu, 1 December 1991.] "Once infected with a strain of flu, people develop lifelong immunity to it."

===Injection versus nasal spray {{anchor|Trivalent}}===
{{anchor|inactivated trivalent injection}}
Flu vaccines are available either as

*TIV (flu shot ([[Injection (medicine)|injection]]) of trivalent (three strains; usually A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B) inactivated (killed) vaccine) or
*LAIV; Q/LAIV (nasal spray (mist) of [[live attenuated influenza vaccine]].)

TIV induces protection after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes are also immunogenic)<ref>{{cite book|last=Plotkin & Mortimer|title=Vaccines|year=1988|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|location=Philidelphia|isbn=0-7216-1946-0}}</ref> based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages.<ref>{{citation |title=Product Monograph: Flumist|year=2011|publisher=Astrazeneca Canada Inc.|url=http://webprod3.hc-sc.gc.ca/dpd-bdpp/item-iteme.do?pm-mp=00013734}}</ref>

LAIV is not recommended for individuals under age 2 or over age 50,<ref>[http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2011.pdf immunize.org] article ''Summary of Recommendations for Adult Immunization'', which is linked from CDC website [http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/adult-schedule.htm#print CDC]</ref> but might be comparatively more effective among children over age 2.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/nasalspray.htm "The Nasal-Spray Flu Vaccine (Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine &#91;LAIV&#93;)"] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</ref>

A study of military personnel showed that flu shots yielded less illness than nasal spray. This study was based on one of the largest head-to-head studies comparing LAIV and TIV. It was conducted by the U.S. Armed Forces Surveillance Center, on military personnel stationed in the U.S. during three flu seasons from 2004 through 2007. Investigators concluded that: "It may be prudent to use TIV in patients who were vaccinated at least once in the past 2 years [...] but LAIV against pandemic strains may be more protective than inactivated vaccines, because the population will probably lack preexisting immunity."<ref>{{Cite journal

=== Cross-protection ===

Annual seasonal flu vaccination provide some protection against flu viruses that the vaccine was not designed for, including novel viruses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xie H, Jing X, Li X, ''et al.'' |title=Immunogenicity and cross-reactivity of 2009-2010 inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine in US adults and elderly |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=e16650 |year=2011 |pmid=21304946 |pmc=3031605 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0016650}}</ref>  The CDC made the following statement in relation to the 2007-2008 vaccine:

: ...[A]ntibodies made in response to vaccination with one strain of influenza viruses can provide protection against different, but related strains. A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the variant viruses, but it still can provide enough protection to prevent or lessen illness severity and prevent flu-related complications. In addition, it is important to remember that the influenza vaccine contains three virus strains so the vaccine can also protect against the other two viruses. For these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match, CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination. This is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts.<ref name="cross-protection"/>

==Vaccination recommendations==
[[Image:Vaccination US Navy.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] personnel receiving influenza vaccination]]
Various public health organizations, including the World Health Organization, have recommended that yearly influenza vaccination be routinely offered to patients at risk of complications of influenza and those individuals who live with or care for high-risk individuals, including:
*the elderly (UK recommendation is those aged 65 or above)
*patients with chronic lung diseases ([[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive airway disease|COPD]], etc.)
*patients with chronic heart diseases ([[congenital heart disease]], chronic [[heart failure]], [[ischaemic heart disease]])
*patients with chronic liver diseases (including [[cirrhosis]])
*patients with chronic renal diseases (such as the [[nephrotic syndrome]])
*patients who are immunosuppressed (those with [[HIV]] or who are receiving drugs to suppress the [[immune system]] such as chemotherapy and long-term [[steroids]]) and their household contacts
*people who live together in large numbers in an environment where influenza can spread rapidly, such as prisons, nursing homes, schools, and dormitories.
*people who plan to attend or participate in a high profile important event with large amounts of people from various places (such as the [[Olympic Games]], [[FIFA World Cup]], and the [[World's Fair]]).

==Cost-effectiveness==
The cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings. In the elderly (aged over 65 years) the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Postma|first=M.J|coauthors=Baltussen, R.P.M., Palache, A.M, Wilschut, J.C.|title=Further evidence for favorable cost-effectiveness of elderly influenza vaccination|journal=Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research|year=2006|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.1586/14737167.6.2.215|pmid=20528557 }}</ref> In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations.<ref>{{Cite journal

{{H5N1}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Vaccines have been formulated against several of the avian [[H5N1]] influenza varieties. Vaccination of poultry against the ongoing H5N1 [[epizootic]] is widespread in certain countries. Some vaccines also exist for use in humans, and others are in testing, but none have been made available to civilian populations, nor produced in quantities sufficient to protect more than a tiny fraction of the Earth's population in the event of an H5N1 [[pandemic]].

==Manufacturing==

In a 2007 report, the global capacity of approximately 826&nbsp;million seasonal influenza vaccine doses (inactivated and live) was double the production of 413&nbsp;million doses. In an aggressive scenario of producing pandemic influenza vaccines by 2013, only 2.8&nbsp;billion courses could be produced in a six-month time frame. If all high- and upper-middle-income countries sought vaccines for their entire populations in a pandemic, nearly 2&nbsp;billion courses would be required. If China pursued this goal as well, more than 3&nbsp;billion courses would be required to serve these populations.<ref>PATH, Oliver Wyman. Influenza Vaccine Strategies for Broad Global Access. 2007. http://www.path.org/files/VAC_infl_publ_rpt_10-07.pdf</ref> Vaccine research and development is ongoing to identify novel vaccine approaches that could produce much greater quantities of vaccine at a price that is affordable to the global population.

Methods of vaccine generation that bypass the need for eggs include the construction of influenza [[virus-like particle]]s (VLP). VLP resemble viruses, but there is no need for inactivation, as they do not include viral coding elements, but merely present antigens in a similar manner to a virion. Some methods of producing VLP include cultures of [[Spodoptera frugiperda]] [[Sf21|Sf9 insect cells]] and plant-based vaccine production (e.g., production in ''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]''). There is evidence that some VLPs elicit antibodies that recognize a broader panel of antigenically distinct viral isolates compared to other vaccines in the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Annual reformulation===
{{Further|Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine}}
{{See also|2009 flu pandemic vaccine}}
Each year, three strains are chosen for selection in that year's flu vaccination by the WHO [[National Influenza Centers|Global Influenza Surveillance Network]]. The chosen strains are the H1N1, H3N2, and Type-B strains thought most likely to cause significant human suffering in the coming season.  Starting with the 2012-2013 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (coincident with the approval of quadrivalent influenza vaccines) the WHO has also recommended a 2nd B-strain for use in quadrivalent vaccines. The [[World Health Organization]] coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year.

:"The WHO [[National Influenza Centers|Global Influenza Surveillance Network]] was established in 1952. The network comprises 4 WHO Collaborating Centres (WHO CCs) and 112 institutions in 83 countries, which are recognized by WHO as WHO National Influenza Centres (NICs). These NICs collect specimens in their country, perform primary virus isolation and preliminary antigenic characterization. They ship newly isolated strains to WHO CCs for high level antigenic and genetic analysis, the result of which forms the basis for [[WHO]] recommendations on the composition of influenza vaccine for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere each year."<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/influenzanetwork/en/index.html WHO] article ''Global influenza surveillance''{{verify source|date=August 2012}}</ref>

The [[National Influenza Centers|Global Influenza Surveillance Network]]'s selection of viruses for the vaccine manufacturing process is based on its best estimate of which strains will predominate the next year, amounting in the end to well-informed but fallible guesswork.<ref>[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/feb/18/keeping-ahead-of-flu-comes-down-to-guessing-game/ Keeping ahead of flu comes down to guessing game : Health and Fitness : Knoxville News Sentinel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Formal WHO recommendations first issued in 1973; beginning 1999 there have been two recommendations per year, one for the northern hemisphere (N) and the other for the southern hemisphere (S).<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/surveillance/Influenza.pdf WHO Report on Global Surveillance of Epidemic-prone Infectious Diseases] (pdf)</ref>

[[Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine]] are listed in a separate article. {{As of|2012|alt=Recent}} WHO seasonal influenza vaccine composition recommendations:

===2013 Southern Hemisphere influenza season===
The composition of virus vaccines for use in the 2013 Southern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization in September, 2012 was:
* an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
* an A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus;
* a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus.

It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses contain the above three viruses and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.<ref>[http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/201209_recommendation.pdf WHO | Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2013 southern hemisphere influenza season].</ref>

===2013-2014 Northern Hemisphere influenza season===
The composition of virus vaccines for use in the 2013-2014 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization on February 20, 2013 was:
* an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;<ref>[http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/terminology_ah1n1pdm09/en/ WHO | Standardization of terminology of the pandemic A(H1N1)2009 virus]</ref>

* B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus.<ref name="who.int">[http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/201302_recommendation.pdf WHO | Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2013-2014 northern hemisphere influenza season]</ref>

It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses contain the above three viruses and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus<ref name="who.int"/>

†It is recommended that A/Texas/50/2012 is used as the A(H3N2) vaccine component because of antigenic changes in earlier A/Victoria/361/2011-like vaccine viruses (such as IVR-165) resulting from adaptation to propagation in eggs.

The H1N1 strain used in these compositions is the same strain used in the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine]], now known as A(H1N1)pdm09.<ref name = "2009 Composition">[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5839a3.htm Update on Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccines]</ref>

===Origins and development===
In the world wide [[Spanish flu]] pandemic of 1918, "Physicians tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and sera (chiefly against what we now call ''Hemophilus influenzae''—a name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agent—and several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success."<ref>[http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/62.html The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready? Workshop Summary (2005) (free online book)] page 62</ref>

In 1931, viral growth in embryonated hens' eggs was reported by [[Ernest William Goodpasture]] and colleagues at [[Vanderbilt University]]. The work was extended to growth of influenza virus by several workers, including Thomas Frances, Wilson Smith and [[Macfarlane Burnet]], leading to the first experimental influenza vaccines.<ref>Plotkin, S.L. and Plotkin, S.A. "A short history of vaccination." ''In: Vaccines'', Stanley A. Plotkin, Walter A. Orenstein, Paul A. Offit, eds. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2008, pp. 6-7.</ref> In the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used in the Second World War.<ref>Artenstein, A.W. "Influenza" ''In: Vaccines: A Biography'' Andrew W. Artenstein, ed. pp. 191-205.</ref> Greater advances were made in vaccinology and immunology, and vaccines became safer and mass-produced. According to a 2006 report advances in molecular technology were close to making influenza vaccines through the genetic manipulation of influenza genes.<ref>[http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/vaccines.htm Influenza Report] article ''Vaccines'' by Stephen Korsman</ref>

===Acceptance===
According to the CDC: "Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. [...] Vaccination is associated with reductions in influenza-related respiratory illness and physician visits among all age groups, hospitalization and death among persons at high risk, [[otitis media]] among children, and work absenteeism among adults. Although influenza vaccination levels increased substantially during the 1990s, further improvements in vaccine coverage levels are needed".<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5103a1.htm CDC] report ''Prevention and Control of Influenza'' published April 12, 2002.</ref>

The egg-based technology (still in use as of 2005) for producing influenza vaccine was created in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Osterholm |first1=Michael T. |title=Preparing for the Next Pandemic |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=18 |pages=1839–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15872196 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp058068}}</ref> In the U.S. [[1976 swine flu outbreak|swine flu scare of 1976]], President [[Gerald Ford]] was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. The [[vaccination]] program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. Meanwhile, maximum military containment efforts succeeded unexpectedly in confining the new strain to the single army base where it had originated. On that base a number of soldiers fell severely ill, but only one died. The program was canceled, after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as 400 excess hospitalizations, both from [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, illustrating that vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result has been cited to stoke lingering doubts about vaccination.<ref name=analysis>[http://www.haverford.edu/biology/edwards/disease/viral_essays/warnervirus.htm The Sky is Falling: An Analysis of the Swine Flu Affair of 1976]</ref> In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976.<ref name="pmid20415539">{{cite journal |author=McCullers JA, Van De Velde LA, Allison KJ, Branum KC, Webby RJ, Flynn PM |title=Vaccinees against the 1976 "swine flu" have enhanced neutralization responses to the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza virus |journal=Clin.

==Research==
[[Influenza research]] includes [[molecular virology]], [[molecular evolution]], [[pathogenesis]], host [[immune response]]s, [[genomics]], and [[epidemiology]]. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as [[vaccine]]s, therapies and diagnostic tools. Improved influenza countermeasures require basic research on how viruses enter cells, replicate, mutate, evolve into new strains and induce an immune response. The [[Influenza Genome Sequencing Project]] is creating a library of influenza sequences{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} that will help us understand what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect [[immunogenicity]], and how the virus evolves over time. Solutions to limitations in current{{when|date=August 2012}} vaccine methods are being researched.

The rapid development, production, and distribution of pandemic influenza vaccines could potentially save millions of lives during an influenza pandemic. Due to the short time frame between identification of a pandemic strain and need for vaccination, researchers are looking at novel technologies for vaccine production that could provide better "real-time" access and be produced more affordably, thereby increasing access for people living in low- and moderate-income countries, where an influenza pandemic may likely originate, such as live attenuated (egg-based or cell-based) technology and recombinant technologies (proteins and virus-like particles).<ref>World Health Organization.

Based on the results of animal studies, a universal flu vaccine may use a two-step vaccination strategy — priming with a DNA-based HA vaccine followed by a second dose with an inactivated, attenuated, or adenovirus-vector–based vaccine.<ref name=Lambert2010>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1002842 |title=Influenza Vaccines for the Future |first2=Anthony S. |pmid=21083388 |last2=Fauci |author=Lambert and Fauci |year=2010 |pages=2036–44 |issue=21 |volume=363 |journal=NEJM }}</ref>

On February 13, 2013, [[FDA]] Chief Scientist Jesse Goodman predicted that a universal flu vaccine was still 5 to 10 years away. When asked about the prospects of a universal flu vaccine in a hearing before House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Goodman replied "Nature is very tricky and as this is a very crafty virus, so I'd be very hesitant to predict... I think the earliest we'd begin to see something with clinical benefit might be 5 to 10 years."<ref>{{cite web|last=Roos|first=Robert|title=FDA expert: Universal flu vaccine still 5-10 years off|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/general/news/feb1313hearing.html|publisher=[[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy]] (CIDRAP)|accessdate=Feb 13, 2013}}</ref>

==Veterinary use==
{{See also|Influenza A virus|Influenza#Infection in other animals}}
"Vaccination in the veterinary world pursues four goals: (i) protection from clinical disease, (ii) protection from infection with virulent virus, (iii) protection from virus excretion, and (iv) serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (so-called DIVA principle). In the field of influenza vaccination, neither commercially available nor experimentally tested vaccines have been shown so far to fulfil all of these requirements."<ref>[http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/ai.htm Influenza Report (online book)] chapter ''Avian Influenza'' by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner</ref>

===Horses===
[[Horse]]s with [[horse flu]] can run a fever, have a dry hacking cough, have a runny nose, and become depressed and reluctant to eat or drink for several days but usually recover in two to three weeks. "Vaccination schedules generally require a primary course of 2 doses, 3–6 weeks apart, followed by boosters at 6–12 month intervals. It is generally recognised that in many cases such schedules may not maintain protective levels of antibody and more frequent administration is advised in high-risk situations."<ref>[http://195.224.162.216/equiflunet/equiflunet_vaccines.html equiflunet_vaccines]</ref>

It is a common requirement at shows in the United Kingdom that horses be vaccinated against equine flu and a vaccination card must be produced; the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI) requires vaccination every six months.<ref>[http://www.uaeequafed.ae/veterinary.htm UAE Equestrian & Racing Federation]</ref><ref>[http://www.horsesport.org/veterinary/PDFS/InflVaccGuide-E.pdf FEI guidelines]</ref>

===Poultry===
[[Poultry]] vaccines for [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] are made on the cheap and are not filtered and purified like human vaccines to remove bits of bacteria or other viruses. They usually contain whole virus, not just [[hemagglutinin]] as in most human flu vaccines. Purification to standards needed for humans is far more expensive than the original creation of the unpurified vaccine from eggs. There is no market for veterinary vaccines that are that expensive. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are [[immunologic adjuvant|adjuvated]] with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. "Chicken vaccinators who have accidentally jabbed themselves have developed painful swollen fingers or even lost thumbs, doctors said. Effectiveness may also be limited. Chicken vaccines are often only vaguely similar to circulating flu strains — some contain an [[H5N2]] strain isolated in Mexico years ago. 'With a chicken, if you use a vaccine that's only 85&nbsp;percent related, you'll get protection,' Dr. Cardona said. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99&nbsp;percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. 'Chickens are smaller and you only need to protect them for six weeks, because that's how long they live till you eat them,' said Dr. John J. Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A([[H5N1]]) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than 1 microgram. 'You have to be careful about extrapolating data from poultry to humans,' warned Dr. David E. Swayne, director of the agriculture department's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. 'Birds are more closely related to [[dinosaur]]s.'"<ref>{{cite news

Researchers, led by Nicholas Savill of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, used mathematical models to simulate the spread of [[H5N1]] and concluded that "at least 95 percent of birds need to be protected to prevent the virus spreading silently. In practice, it is difficult to protect more than 90 percent of a flock; protection levels achieved by a vaccine are usually much lower than this."<ref>[http://www.scidev.net/gateways/index.cfm?fuseaction=readitem&rgwid=4&item=News&itemid=3051&language=1 SciDev.Net] article ''Bird flu warning over partial protection of flocks'' published August 16, 2006</ref> The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has issued recommendations on the prevention and control of avian influenza in poultry, including the use of vaccination.<ref>FAO Recommendations on the Prevention, Control and Eradication of Highly Pathogenic Avian

A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed{{when|date=August 2012}} and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and commonly bird flu.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Pigs===
[[Swine origin influenza virus]] (SoIV) vaccines are extensively used in the [[swine]] industry in Europe and North America. Most swine flu vaccine manufacturers include an [[H1N1]] and an [[H3N2]] SoIV strains.

Swine influenza has been recognized as a greater problem since the [[1976 swine flu outbreak|outbreak in 1976]]. [[Evolution]] of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine origin flu vaccines are effective in controlling the problem when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.<ref>[http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/swine_flu_virus_endemic/ National Hog Farmer] article ''Swine Flu Virus Turns Endemic'' published September 15, 2007</ref> SoIV vaccine manufacture Novartis paints this picture: "A strain of swine origin influenza virus (SoIV) called H3N2, first identified in the US in 1998, has brought exasperating production losses to swine producers. Abortion storms are a common sign. Sows go off feed for two or three days and run a fever up to 106°F. Mortality in a naïve herd can run as high as 15%."<ref>[http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html livestock.novartis.com] Custom Vaccines: Swine</ref>

===Dogs===
In 2004, [[Influenza A virus]] subtype [[H3N8]] was discovered to cause [[canine influenza]]. Because of the lack of previous exposure to this virus, dogs have no natural immunity to this virus. However a vaccine is now available.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karaca K, Dubovi E, Siger L, Robles A, Audonnet J, Jiansheng Y, Nordgren R, Minke J |title=Evaluation of the ability of canarypox-vectored equine influenza virus vaccines to induce humoral immune responses against canine influenza viruses in dogs |journal=Am.
