An '''Intensive Care Unit''' ('''ICU'''), also known as a '''Critical Care Unit''' ('''CCU'''), '''Intensive Therapy Unit''' or '''Intensive Treatment Unit''' ('''ITU''') is a special department of a [[hospital]] or health care facility that provides [[intensive-care medicine]]. 

Intensive Care Units cater to [[patients]] with the most [[Medical emergency|severe and life-threatening]] illnesses and injuries; that require constant, close monitoring and support from specialist equipment and medication in order to maintain [[human homeostasis|normal bodily functions]]. They are staffed by highly trained [[physician|doctors]] and [[Critical care nursing|critical care nurses]] who specialise in caring for seriously ill patients. Common conditions that are treated within ICU's include those such as [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[multiple organ failure]] and [[sepsis]].<ref>http://www.ics.ac.uk/patients___relatives/what_is_intensive_care_</ref> 

Patients may be transferred directly to an Intensive Care Unit from an [[Emergency Department]] if required, or from a ward if they rapidly deteriorate; or immediately after surgery if the surgery is majorly invasive and the patient is at high risk of complications.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-icu.htm|title=Intensive Care Unit

==History==
{{see also|Intensive-care medicine}}
In 1854, [[Florence Nightingale]] left for the [[Crimean War]], where [[triage]], used to separate seriously wounded soldiers from the less-seriously wounded, was observed. Until recently, it was reported that Nightingale reduced mortality from 40% to 2% on the battlefield. Although this was not the case, her experiences during the war formed the foundation for her later discovery of the importance of sanitary conditions in hospitals, a critical component of intensive care.

In 1950, [[anesthesiologist]] [[Peter Safar]] established the concept of "Advanced Support of Life," keeping [[patient]]s sedated and ventilated in an intensive-care environment. Safar is considered to be the first practitioner of intensive-care medicine as a speciality.

In response to a [[polio]] [[epidemic]] (where many patients required constant ventilation and surveillance), [[Bjørn Aage Ibsen]] established the first intensive-care unit in [[Copenhagen]] in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijh/vol3n2/icu.xml|date=|publisher=Internet Journal of Health|accessdate=2007-08-25|title=Intensive Care Unit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/The%20Danish%20anaesthesiologist%20Bj%C3%B6rn%20Ibsen%2C%20Louise%20Reisner-S%C3%A9n%C3%A9lar%2C%202009.pdf?w=a25aff0a |title=The Danish anaesthesiologist Björn Ibsen a pioneer of long-term ventilation on the upper airways, Louise Reisner-Sénélar, 2009}}</ref> The first application of this idea in the United States was in 1955 by Dr. William Mosenthal, a surgeon at the [[Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/spring04/html/vs_mosenthal.shtml|date=|publisher=Dartmouth Medicine|accessdate=2007-04-10|title=Remembering Dr. William Mosenthal: A simple idea from a special surgeon}}</ref> In the 1960s, the importance of [[cardiac arrhythmias]] as a source of [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]] in [[myocardial infarction]]s (heart attacks) was recognized. This led to the routine use of cardiac monitoring in ICUs, especially after heart attacks. [http://www.medicinaintensiva.com.br/icu-history.htm ICU History Video]

Hospitals may have ICU's that cater to a specific medical speciality or patient, such as those listed below:
*[[Neonatal intensive-care unit|Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]] ('''NICU''') 
*[[Pediatric intensive-care unit|Pediatric Intensive Care Unit]] ('''PICU''')
*[[Psychiatric intensive-care unit|Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit]] ('''PICU''')
*[[Coronary care unit|Coronary Care Unit]] ('''CCU''') - Also known as Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU)
*[[Post-anesthesia care unit|Post Anesthesia Care Unit]] ('''PACU''') - Also known as the Post-Operative Recovery Unit, or Recovery Room, the PACU provides immediate post-op observation and stabilisation of patients following surgical operations and anesthesia. Patients are usually held in such facilities for a limited amount of time, and must meet a set [[physiological]] criteria before transfer back to a ward with a qualified nurse escort takes place. Due to high patient flow in Recovery Units, and owing to the [[bed management]] cycle, if a patient breaches a time frame and is too unstable to be transferred back to a ward, they are normally transferred to a High Dependency Unit (HDU) or Post-Operative Critical Care Unit (POCCU) for closer observation. 
*High Dependency Unit ('''HDU''') - Many hospitals have a transitional High Dependency Unit (HDU) for patients who require close observation, treatment and nursing care that cannot be provided on a general ward, but whose care is not at a critical enough level to warrant an ICU bed. These units are also called step-down, progressive and intensive recovery units and are utilised until a patient's conditions stabilises enough to qualify them for discharge to a general ward.<ref>http://www.healthtalkonline.org/intensive_care/Intensive_care_Patients_experiences/Topic/1217/</ref>

==Equipment and systems==
[[File:Clinicians in Intensive Care Unit.jpg|thumb|Clinicians in Intensive Care Unit]]
Common equipment in an ICU includes [[mechanical ventilator]]s to assist breathing through an [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal tube]] or a [[tracheotomy]]; cardiac monitors including those with [[telemetry]]; external [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]]; [[defibrillators]]; [[dialysis]] equipment for [[kidney|renal]] problems; equipment for the constant [[medical monitors|monitoring]] of bodily functions; a web of [[intravenous fluids|intravenous lines]], feeding tubes, [[nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tubes]], suction pumps, drains, and [[catheters]]; and a wide array of [[pharmacology|drugs]] to treat the primary condition(s) of hospitalization. [[induced coma|Medically induced comas]], [[analgesic]]s, and [[sedation|induced sedation]] are common ICU tools needed and used to reduce [[pain]] and prevent [[secondary infection]]s.

==Quality of care==
The available data suggests a relation between ICU volume and quality of care for mechanically ventilated patients.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Kahn JM, Goss CH, Heagerty PJ, Kramer AA, O'Brien CR, Rubenfeld GD.  | first1 = JM  | last2 = Goss  | first2 = CH  | last3 = Heagerty  | first3 = PJ  | last4 = Kramer  | first4 = AA  | last5 = O'Brien  | first5 = CR  | last6 = Rubenfeld  | first6 = GD  | title = Hospital volume and the outcomes of mechanical ventilation  | journal = New England Journal of Medicine  | volume = 355  | issue = 1  | pages = 41–50   | year = 2006  | pmid = 16822995  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsa053993}}</ref> After adjustment for severity of illnesses, [[demography|demographic]] variables, and characteristics of different ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU staffing was significantly associated with lower ICU and hospital [[mortality rate]]s. A ratio of 2 patients to 1 nurse is recommended for a medical ICU, which contrasts to the ratio of 4:1 or 5:1 typically seen on medical floors. This varies from country to country, though; e.g., in Australia and the United Kingdom most ICUs are staffed on a 2:1 basis (for High-Dependency patients who require closer monitoring or more intensive treatment than a hospital ward can offer) or on a 1:1 basis for patients requiring very intensive support and monitoring; for example, a patient on a mechanical ventilator with associated anaesthetics or sedation such as [[propofol]], [[Midazolam]] and use of strong analgesics such as [[morphine]], [[fentanyl]] and/or [[remifentanil]].
