==Contributions to medicine==

===Pioneering Open heart surgery in Nepal===
Koirala first performed open-heart surgery in 1997. His initiative gave a hope for treating heart diseases inside the country by establishing the first fully operational heart hospital, and also to ensure free service for the needy.

His [[Corporate social responsibility|social initiative]] came at the time when Nepal completely lacked resources to treat heart patients, and the rate of heart related diseases were increasing in the region. According to a National Report on [[Non-communicable disease|NCDs]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|CVDs]] compiled by [[National Human Rights Commission|NHRC]] in 2010;

{{quotation|Distribution of NCDs in terms of socio demographic variables (age, sex, ethnic groups, and geographic area) was calculated. Data shows that out of the total admitted patients, 36.5% patients suffered from NCDs.Out of total NCDs, 38% were having heart diseases followed by COPD (33%), where as diabetes and cancer accounted for 10% and 19% cases respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhrc.org.np/reports/Non_Communicable_diseases.pdf|title=Report on [[Non-communicable disease|NCDs]]|accessdate=2012-12-28|publisher=NHRC.org.np}}</ref>}}

MCVTC, headed by Koirala, is famously known for providing medicines at lower prices than the [[suggested retail price]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=33194|title=Koirala and his institution providing drugs at cheapest cost|accessdate=2012-12-28|publisher=MyRepublica.com}}</ref> He also represents the team of [[Cardiac surgery|Cardiovascular Surgery]] for ''Asia Pacific Society of Cardiology's Scientific Council'' (May 2011 to Feb 2013).<ref name="MCVTC" /><ref name="APSCardio">{{cite web|url=http://www.apscardio.org/pdf/sc_roster_may2011_feb2013.pdf|title=APSC Scientific team|accessdate=2012-12-28|publisher=APSCardio.org}}</ref>
