The role of '''femtosecond lasers in cataract surgery''' is to assist or replace several aspects of the manual [[cataract surgery]]. These include the creation of the initial [[surgical incision]]s in the [[cornea]], the creation of the [[capsulotomy]], and the initial fragmenting (breaking up) of the [[Lens (eye)|lens]]. The [[femtosecond laser]] may also produce incisions within the peripheral cornea to aid the correction of pre-existing astigmatism. The preliminary results are promising.<ref>Nagy Z, Takacs A, Filkorn T, Sarayba M. Initial clinical evaluation of an intraocular femtosecond laser in cataract surgery.

==History==

Femtosecond lasers have been used successfully in ophthalmic surgery since 2001.<ref>Ratkay-Traub I, Juhasz T, Horvath C, et al. Ultra-short pulse (femtosecond) laser surgery: initial use in LASIK flap creation. Ophthalmol Clin North Am 2001;14:347-55.</ref><ref>Kim P, Sutton GL, Rootman DS. Applications of the femtosecond laser in corneal refractive surgery. Curr Opin Ophthalmol 2011;22:238-44.</ref> The technology has been applied widely, most notably in [[LASIK]] (Laser In-Situ Keratomileusis) refractive surgery. In FemtoLASIK the laser replaces a mechanical device ([[microkeratome]]) to create a precise corneal flap preparing the eye for the secondary laser ablation in order to change the patient’s refractive error.  There are several benefits; Femtosecond lasers have been noted to be more precise than microkeratomes, with fewer likely collateral tissue effects.<ref>Sutton G, Hodge C. Accuracy and precision of LASIK flap thickness using the IntraLase femtosecond laser in 1000 consecutive cases. J Refract Surg 2008;24:802-6.</ref><ref>Kezirian GM, Stonecipher KG. Comparison of the IntraLase femtosecond laser and mechanical keratomes for laser in situ keratomileusis. J Cataract Refract Surg 2004;30:804-11.</ref> This has contributed to more precise, reproducible and safe LASIK outcomes.

The Femtosecond laser for cataract surgery was first used by Professor Zoltan Nagy in Budapest, Hungary in 2008. Dr Stephen Slade and Bob Cionii in the USA, Dr Michael Knorz in Europe and Dr Michael Lawless in Australia have led the introduction of this technology around the world.

==Clear Corneal Incisions==
Access to the cataract is initiated through small incisions (around 2mm in length) made into the peripheral [[cornea]]. Known as Clear Corneal Incisions (CCI) they remain the preferred method for surgeons accessing the anterior chamber of the eye during cataract surgery. Previously large incisions (approximately 5-7mm in length) were made into the [[sclera]] (white part of the eye). This is a highly vascularized part of the eye and required particular consideration for older patients on blood thinning therapy. To ensure that the incisions were adequately sealed, sutures were required following surgery. The need for sutures prolonged the recovery process. Routine CCIs are generally considered to be self-sealing (that is no sutures are required). In comparison to scleral incisions, CCIs have reduced some potential complications and increase the speed of recovery**. The smaller incisions will also impact on the visual outcome for the patient.

Routinely incisions are created manually by introducing a sharp, sterile blade into the cornea. Despite the perceived advantages of CCI’s over large, scleral incisions there appears to have been an increase in the incidence of [[endophthalmitis]] (postoperative infection within the eye), which has been directly linked to the use of these CCIs.<ref>Nichamin LD, Chang DF, Johnson SH, Mamalis N, Masket S, Packard RB, Rosenthal KJ; American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Cataract Clinical Committee. ASCRS White Paper: What is the association between clear corneal cataract incisions and postoperative endophthalmitis? J Cataract Refract Surg. 2006 Sep;32(9):1556-9. Review</ref><ref>Lundström M. Endophthalmitis and incision construction. Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2006 Feb;17(1):68-71. Review.</ref> The use of a manual blade makes it difficult to control the length and architecture of the incision which may affect the stability of the wound under pressure. Following the surgery this could manifest by the corneal wound leaking increasing the potential risk of infection.  Although the rate appears to be very low, endophthalmitis may be devastating with both clinical and financial implications arising from this complication. The additional cost of treating endophthalmitis including hospital stay has been estimated at €3,688 in one European study.<ref>Colin X, Berdeaux G, Lafuma A et al. Inpatient Costs of Endophthalmitis Evaluated for the Whole of France. Applied Economics Health Policy; 8 (1): 53 to 60</ref>  This does not include costs to society such as loss of productivity for patients and carers.

Laboratory studies on cadaver eyes have shown that the femtosecond laser produces consistent and stable incisions.<ref>Steinert R. Presentation. Femtosecond Laser Refractive Cataract Surgery. 63rd Annual Proctor Lecture. Dec 3, 2011 Accessed 6th June http://www.ucsfcme.com/2012/slides/MOP12002/33SteinertFemtosecondLaserCataractSurgery.pdf</ref> This has been attributed both to the controlled, reproducible generation of the incisions and the configuration of the corneal wound created.<ref>Masket S, Sarayba M, Ignacio T, Fram N. Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract incisions: architectural stability and reproducibility. J Cataract Refract Surg 2010 Jun;36(6):1048-9</ref> It would suggest that laser-cut, clear corneal incisions offer the potential of less risk of wound leak thereby further reducing the risk of infection following surgery. This will require a large amount of data to confirm and definitive results will not be present for some time.

The precision of the laser created incisions should also allow the surgeon greater control over the final refractive endpoint possibly leading to improved visual outcomes. Again further data is required at this point to confirm these assertions.

==Capsulotomy==
The femtosecond laser is able to create a near perfect, round opening in the anterior capsule by ablating the pattern onto the desired area. The surgeon then is able to simply remove the tissue with surgical forceps. This has several potential benefits over the radially-created manual procedure. Both Nagy and Freidman<ref>Nagy Z, Takacs A, Filkorn T, Sarayba M. Initial clinical evaluation of an intraocular femtosecond laser in cataract surgery. J Refract Surg 2009;25:1053-60.</ref><ref>Friedman NJ, Palanker DV, Schuele G, Andersen D, Marcellino G, Seibel BS, Batlle J, Feliz R, Talamo JH, Blumenkranz MS, Culbertson WW. Femtosecond laser capsulotomy.  J Cataract Refract Surg. 2011 Jul;37(7):1189-98. Erratum in: J Cataract Refract Surg. 2011 Sep;37(9):1742</ref> have shown that the strength of the capsule is as good as or greater than a manual capsulorhexis (opening created in the capsule) and the smoothness of the capsulotomy edge is similar to manually created openings. This may serve to further reduce the incidence of intraoperative tears to the capsular bag. Capsular tears are not an insignificant problem.  They lead to prolonged surgery and a potential list of complications can result; including posterior extension of the tear, retained soft lens matter requiring removal, persistent uveitis, cystoid macular oedema, and secondary retinal detachment*.

In conventional cataract surgery the incidence of anterior capsular tears has been documented from 0.79% in very experienced hands* to 5.3% within teaching institutions.<ref>Marques FF, Marques DM, Osher RH, Osher JM. Fate of anterior capsule tears during cataract surgery. J Cataract Refract Surg 2006;32:1638-42.</ref><ref>Unal M, Yücel I, Sarici A et al. Phacoemulsification with topical anesthesia: Resident experience. J Cataract Refract Surg. 2006;32:1361-5.</ref> In the study by Marques et al33 40% of anterior capsular tears extended to the posterior capsule and 20% required further surgery emphasising the potential cascade of issues that may result from this complication. Lawless in April 2012 presented his initial data indicating a 0% incidence of anterior tears throughout his initial 450 cases.<ref>Lawless M Presentation. Intraoperative and Early Postoperative Safety and Efficacy Using Femosecond Laser in Cataract Surgery Compared with Outcomes in Nonlaser Control Group ASCRS April 20–24 Chicago 2012</ref> Although further hard data is limited, reports suggest that laser cataract surgery is at least as safe and indications are that it may prove to be safer and more accurate for patients.

The capsulotomy may also impact on the visual outcome. An irregularly-shaped capsulotomy may influence the position of the implanted IOL leading to decentration and tilt leading to a decrease in the patient’s quality of vision. The ability to create a precise, well-centred capsulotomy should therefore optimize the surgeon’s ability to achieve patient’s visual outcome.  Palanker et al. confirm the accuracy of the laser guided surgery. He showed a mean circularity of 0.942 in 29 lasered eyes compared with 0.774 in 30 manual eyes, and a twelvefold improvement in the precision of the capsulotomy diameter.  Freidman<ref>Friedman NJ, Palanker DV, Schuele G, Andersen D, Marcellino G, Seibel BS, Batlle J, Feliz R, Talamo JH, Blumenkranz MS, Culbertson WW. Femtosecond laser capsulotomy.  J Cataract Refract Surg. 2011 Jul;37(7):1189-98. Erratum in: J Cataract Refract Surg. 2011 Sep;37(9):1742</ref> demonstrated that the deviation from intended diameter was 29&nbsp;µm ± 26μm for laser capsulotomies and 337μm ± 258μm for a manual technique with a mean deviation from circularity of 6% and 20% respectively.  Further evidence from Kranitz et al.<ref>Kranitz K, Takacs A, Mihaltz K, et al. Femtosecond laser capsulotomy and & manual continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis parameters and their effects on intraocular lens centration. J Refract Surg 2011; 27:558–563</ref> have shown that in comparison to manually created capsulotomies those created with a laser have significantly lower internal aberrations following surgery.

Cekic<ref>Marques FF, Marques DM, Osher RH, Osher JM. Fate of anterior capsule tears during cataract surgery. J Cataract Refract Surg 2006;32:1638-42.</ref> previously demonstrated that capsulorhexis of different sizing will lead to variation of the IOL position. It thereby follows that if a surgeon can systematically control the capsulorhexis size then the final visual outcomes will become more consistent also. This may prove to be the greatest potential advantage of laser-assisted cataract surgery although data significant to provide a clinical benefit is not available at this timepoint.

==Phacofragmentation==
The femtosecond laser has the capability to assist the fragmentation (breaking up) of the cataract. The laser applies a number of pulses to the lens in a pre-designed pattern which then allows the surgeon to use current technology to remove the lens matter. This additional step has been shown to reduce the average time and energy required to break up and remove the lens by approximately 50%.<ref>Nagy Z, Takacs A, Filkorn T, Sarayba M. Initial clinical evaluation of an intraocular femtosecond laser in cataract surgery. J Refract Surg 2009;25:1053-60.</ref><ref>Batlle JF, Feliz R, Culbertson WW. OCT-guided femtosecond laser cataract & surgery: precision and efficacy. Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. A4694 Poster #D633. Fort Lauderdale, FL; 2011. www.arvo.org</ref><ref>Edwards K, Uy HS, Schneider S. The effect of laser lens fragmentation on use & of ultrasound energy in cataract surgery. Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. A4710 Poster #D768. Fort Lauderdale, FL; 2011. www.arvo.org</ref> Inherently this should make the overall procedure safer and less traumatic to the eye, which may further reduce the risk of postoperative swelling and lead also to a faster visual recovery.

==Complications==
Laser cataract surgery has been designed to provide better visual outcomes and reduce the overall risk to the patient during surgery. The procedure though is not performed without risk of complication. The use of pressure to maintain adequate suction upon the eye throughout the laser procedure has been seen to create minor subconjunctival haemorrhages (seen on the white part of the eye). These have no impact on the surgery or the final postoperative vision and resolve in the early postoperative period. The patient is also unlikely to feel discomfort or pain as a result of these haemorrhages.

Roberts et al.<ref>Roberts TV, Sutton G, Lawless MA, Jindal-Bali S, Hodge C. Capsular block syndrome associated with femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery.  J Cataract Refract Surg. 2011 Nov;37(11):2068-70.</ref> published data to suggest that patients with dense cataracts may be at greater risk of capsular rupture due to the additional forces created within the bag during surgery. These cases were part of the initial installation of a laser unit and the combination of surgeon awareness and unit software/hardware upgrades in the time since has likely rendered this issue both predictable and preventable.

As with the introduction of any new technology there appears also to be a learning curve to the procedure. Bali et al.<ref>Bali SJ, Hodge C, Lawless M, Roberts TV, Sutton G. Early experience with the femtosecond laser for cataract surgery. Ophthalmology. 2012 May;119(5):891-9.</ref> described, in their initial installation, a number of complications that occurred during or immediately following surgery. The majority of these complications appeared to have no impact on the visual outcome. This represents the first 200 cases of an early installation. In early 2013, the same group published their findings over the subsequent 1500 surgeries. The results presented suggest that laser cataract surgery is at least as safe, and in many cases safer, than previously published literature concerning manual surgery.<ref>Roberts TV, Lawless M, Bali SJ, Hodge C, Sutton G. Surgical Outcomes and Safety of Femtosecond Laser Cataract Surgery A Prospective Study of 1500 Consecutive Cases. Ophthalmology 2013;120:227–233</ref>

==Current Technology==
Currently there are four lasers at or near the point of commercial release. These include Alcon LenSx (Alcon Laboratories, Ft Worth, TX, USA), OptiMedica Catalys (Optimedica Corp, CA, USA), LensAR(LensAR Inc, FL, USA) and Technolas (Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH, Germany). All laser systems share a common platform which includes an anterior segment imaging system, patient interface and femtosecond laser to image, calculate and deliver the laser pulses. The specific technology to achieve these steps differs between the individual lasers with notable differences in imaging and docking systems and laser treatment algorithms. There appears to be little, if no data to assert the enhanced ability of a single unit over the others at this time.<ref>Lawless M, Hodge C Femtosecond Laser Cataract Surgery: An Experience From Australia Asia-Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology. 1(1):5-10, January 2012.</ref> The choice for surgeons in 2012 will be related to availability, technical support and cost. Currently by mid-2012 over 40,000 eyes have been operated in 34 countries.
