In [[soft tissue|soft-tissue]] [[laser surgery]], interaction of laser light with the soft tissue provides a special approach to [[surgery]].  A highly focused [[laser beam]] vaporizes the soft [[biological tissue|tissue]] with the high water content.  Laser can make very small incisions when the beam is focused on the tissue (focal spot size can be as small as =0.1&nbsp;mm, but the most widely used in practice is 0.4&nbsp;mm). When the beam is defocused, the intensity of the laser light on the tissue diminishes, and it can be used for [[cauterization]] of small blood vessels and lymphatics, therefore decreases post-operative swellings. 

A laser beam has a natural sterilization effectâ€”it evaporates bacteria, viruses and fungi, which leads to a decrease in local infections. Probably most important, the laser decreases post-operative pain by sealing nerve endings. Soft-tissue laser surgery is differentiated from hard-tissue laser surgery ([[bone]]s and [[teeth]] in [[dentistry]] <ref>D.J.Coluzzi, R.A.Convissar,  Atlas of Laser Applications in Dentistry, Quintessense Books, ISBN 978-0-86715-476-4</ref>) and Laser Eye Surgery (eyesight corrective surgeries <ref>http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/lasik/ URL accessed March 25, 2008</ref>) by the [[List of laser types|type of lasers]] used in a particular type of laser surgery.

Hard Tissue surgical lasers are dominated by [[Er:YAG laser]]s operating at the wavelengths around 3,000&nbsp;nm. [[Laser eye surgery|Laser Eye Surgeries]] utilize [[excimer]] lasers in the UV range of wavelengths. Unlike many solid-state and diode lasers in the visible and near infrared wavelength range (600-2,000&nbsp;nm), the [[Carbon dioxide laser|Carbon dioxide or CO<sub>2</sub> laser]] wavelength (10,600&nbsp;nm) is highly absorbed by in-vivo soft tissues containing water.<ref>http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/vibrat.html Water Absorption Spectrum. URL accessed April 3, 2008</ref> Furthermore, modern CO<sub>2</sub> laser technology makes these lasers far more affordable than solid-state Er:YAG lasers, which also feature a wavelength that is highly absorbed by water. Because of their wavelength and precision, CO<sub>2</sub> lasers remain the dominant soft-tissue surgical lasers.

Surgical laser systems are differentiated not only by the wavelength, but also by the light delivery system: flexible fiber or articulated arm, as well as by other factors.

Soft-tissue laser surgery is used in a variety of applications in human ([[General surgery]], [[Neurosurgery]], [[Otolaryngology|ENT]], [[Dentistry]], [[Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery]]<ref>A. Moritz:  Oral Laser Applications, Quintessense Books, ISBN 1-85097-150-1</ref> etc.) as well as [[veterinary]] <ref>N.
