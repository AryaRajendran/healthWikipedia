'''Pulmonology''' is the medical specialty dealing with [[disease]] involving the [[respiratory tract]].<ref name=acp>[http://www.acponline.org/patients_families/about_internal_medicine/subspecialties/pulmonology/ ACP: Pulmonology: Internal Medicine Subspecialty]. Acponline.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-30.</ref> The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''pulmō, pulmonis'' ("lung") and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]''.  Pulmonology is also occasionally referred to as '''pneumology''', from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πνεύμων ("lung") and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', and sometimes also '''respirology'''.

Pulmonology is called [[chest]] [[medicine]] and respiratory medicine in some countries and areas. ''Pulmonology'' is considered a branch of [[internal medicine]], and is related to [[intensive care medicine]]. Pulmonology often involves managing patients who need life support and [[mechanical ventilation]].  Pulmonologists are specially trained in diseases and conditions of the chest, particularly [[pneumonia]], [[asthma]], [[tuberculosis]], [[emphysema]], and complicated chest infections.

== Respiratory physicians ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]]{{dubious|date=July 2012}}, and [[Australia]] the term "respiratory physician" is used (rather than pulmonologist) to distinguish a [[physician]] that practices pulmonology. In [[Canada]], respirology and respirologist are used. [[Surgery]] of the respiratory tract is generally performed by specialists in [[cardiothoracic surgery]] (or [[thoracic surgery]]), though minor procedures may be performed by pulmonologists. As mentioned above, pulmonology is closely related to critical care medicine when dealing with patients that require mechanical ventilation. As a result, many pulmonologists are certified to practice critical care medicine in addition to pulmonary medicine. There are fellowship programs that allow physicians to become board certified in pulmonary and critical care medicine simultaneously. Interventional pulmonology is a relatively new field within pulmonary medicine that deals with the use of procedures such as [[bronchoscopy]] to treat several pulmonary diseases. Interventional pulmonology is yet widely recognized as a specific medical specialty.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Luis M. Seijo and Daniel H. Sterman |title=Interventional Pulmonology |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=344 |issue=10 |pages=740–49 |year=2001 |pmid=11236779 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200103083441007}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
The pulmonologist begins the diagnostic process with a general review focusing on:
* [[hereditary diseases]] affecting the lungs ([[cystic fibrosis]], [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]])
* exposure to [[toxin]]s ([[tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]], [[asbestos]], [[exhaust gas|exhaust fumes]], [[coal mining]] fumes)
* exposure to [[infectious disease|infectious agents]] (certain types of [[bird]]s, malt processing)
* an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diathesis]] that might predispose to certain conditions ([[pulmonary fibrosis]], [[pulmonary hypertension]])

Physical diagnostics are as important as in the other fields of [[medicine]].
*Inspection of the hands for signs of [[cyanosis]] or [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]], chest wall, and respiratory rate.
*Palpation of the [[cervical lymph nodes]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and chest wall movement.
*[[Percussion of the lung]] fields for dullness or [[hyperresonance]].
*[[Auscultation]] (with a [[stethoscope]]) of the lung fields for diminished or unusual [[breath sounds]].
**[[Rales]] or [[Rhonchi]] heard over lung fields with a [[stethoscope]].

As many [[cardiology|heart diseases]] can give pulmonary signs, a thorough cardiac investigation is usually included.

== Procedures ==
* [[Laboratory]] investigation of [[blood]] ([[blood test]]s). Sometimes [[arterial blood gas]] measurements are also required.
* [[Spirometry]] (the determination of [[lung volumes]] in time by breathing into a dedicated machine; response to [[bronchodilatator]]s and [[diffusion]] of [[carbon monoxide]])
* [[Bronchoscopy]] with [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] (BAL), endobronchial and [[transbronchial]] [[biopsy]] and [[epithelium|epithelial]] brushing
* [[X-rays|Chest X-rays]]
* [[Computed tomography|CT scanning]] ([[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scanning]] is rarely used)
* [[Scintigraphy]] and other methods of [[nuclear medicine]]
* [[Positron emission tomography]] (especially in [[lung cancer]])
* [[Polysomnography]] (sleep studies) commonly used for the diagnosis of [[Sleep apnea]]

=== Surgical procedures ===
Major surgical procedures on the heart and lungs are performed by a [[thoracic surgery|thoracic surgeon]].  Pulmonologists often perform specialized procedures to get samples from the inside of the chest or inside of the lung.  They use radiographic techniques to view vasculature of the lungs and heart to assist with diagnosis.

== Treatment and therapeutics ==
{{see also|Cardiothoracic surgery|Pulmonary rehabilitation}}

[[Medication]] is the most important treatment of most diseases of pulmonology, either by inhalation ([[bronchodilator]]s and [[steroid]]s) or in oral form ([[antibiotic]]s, [[leukotriene antagonist]]s). A common example being the usage of [[inhalers]] in the treatment of inflammatory lung conditions such as [[Asthma]] or [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. [[Oxygen therapy]] is often necessary in severe respiratory disease ([[emphysema]] and [[pulmonary fibrosis]]). When this is insufficient, the patient might require [[mechanical ventilation]].

Pulmonary rehabilitation has been defined as  multidimensional continuum of services directed to persons with pulmonary disease and their families, usually by an interdisciplinary team of specialists, with the goal of achieving and maintaining the individual's maximum level of independence and functioning in the community. Pulmonary rehabilitation is intended to educate the patient, the family, and improve the overall quality of life and [[prognosis]] for the patient. Interventions can include exercise, education, emotional support, oxygen, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, optimization of airway secretion clearance, promoting compliance with medical care to reduce numbers of exacerbations and hospitalizations, and returning to work and/or a more active and emotionally satisfying life. These goals are appropriate for any patients with diminished respiratory reserve whether due to obstructive or intrinsic pulmonary diseases (oxygenation impairment) or neuromuscular weakness (ventilatory impairment).  A pulmonary rehabilitation team may include a rehabilitation physician, a pulmonary medicine specialist, and allied health professionals including a rehabilitation [[nurse]], a [[respiratory therapist]], a [[physical therapist]], an [[occupational therapist]], a [[psychologist]], and a [[social worker]] among others.

== Education and training ==
In the [[United States]], pulmonologists are physicians who, after receiving a medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]), complete [[residency (medicine)|residency]] training in [[internal medicine]], followed by at least two additional years of subspeciality [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] training in pulmonology.  After satisfactorily completing a fellowship in pulmonary medicine, the physician is permitted to take the board certification examination in pulmonary medicine.  After passing this exam, the physician is then board certified as a pulmonologist.  Most pulmonologists complete three years of combined subspecialty fellowship training in pulmonary medicine and critical care medicine.

=== Pediatric pulmonologist ===
In the [[United States]], pediatric pulmonologists are [[physicians]] who, after receiving a medical degree (MD or DO), complete residency training in [[pediatrics]], followed by at least three additional years of subspeciality fellowship training in pulmonology.

== Scientific research ==
Pulmonologists are involved in both clinical and basic research of the [[respiratory system]], ranging from the anatomy of the [[respiratory epithelium]] to the most effective treatment of [[pulmonary hypertension]].  Scientific research also takes place to look for causes and possible treatment in diseases such as [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] and [[lung cancer]].

== History of pulmonology ==
One of the first major discoveries relevant to the field of pulmonology was the discovery of [[pulmonary circulation]]. Originally, it was thought that [[blood]] reaching the right side of the [[heart]] passed through small 'pores' in the [[Interventricular septum|septum]] into the left side to be oxygenated, as theorized by [[Galen]]; however, the discovery of pulmonary circulation disproves this theory, which had previously been accepted since the 2nd century. Thirteenth century [[anatomist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Ibn Al-Nafis]] accurately theorized that there was no 'direct' passage between the two sides ([[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]) of the heart. He believed that the blood must have passed through the [[pulmonary artery]], through the lungs, and back into the heart to be [[circulatory system|pumped]] around the body. This is believed by many to be the first scientific description of pulmonary circulation.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ishim.net/ishimj/2/09.pdf |title=The discovery of the pulmonary circulation – who should get the credit: ibn Al-Nafis or William Harvey |author=Sharif Kaf A-Ghazal |page=46 |journal=JISHIM |year=2002 |volume=2}}</ref> 

Although pulmonary medicine only began to evolve as a medical specialty in the 1950s, [[William H. Welch|William Welch]] and [[William Osler]] founded the 'parent' organization of the [[American Thoracic Society]], the National Association for the Study and Prevention of [[Tuberculosis]]. The care, treatment, and study of tuberculosis of the lung is recognised as a discipline in its own right, [[phthisiology]]. When the specialty did begin to evolve, several discoveries were being made linking the respiratory system and the measurement of arterial blood gases, attracting more and more physicians and researchers to the developing field.<ref>[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/pulmonary/about/history.html History of the Division].
