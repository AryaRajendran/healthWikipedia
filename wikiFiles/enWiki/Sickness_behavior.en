'''Sickness behavior''' is a coordinated set of [[adaptation|adaptive]]  behavioral changes that develop in [[illness|ill]] individuals during the course of an [[infection]].<ref name="Hart">{{Cite PMID|3050629}}</ref>
They usually (but not necessarily)<ref name="Kent1992">{{Cite PMID|1409612}}</ref> accompany [[fever]] and aid survival.
Such illness responses include [[lethargy]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]],<ref>{{Cite PMID|9468766}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|283688}}</ref>

Sickness behavior is a [[Motivation#Motivational_concepts|motivational state]] that reorganizes the organism's priorities to cope with infectious [[pathogens]].<ref name="Kelley2003" /><ref>{{Cite PMID|12072271}}</ref>
It has been suggested as relevant to understanding [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and some aspects of the suffering that occurs in [[cancer]].

==History==
Sick animals have long been recognized by farmers as having different behavior. Initially it was thought that this was due to physical weakness that resulted from diverting energy to the body processes needed to fight infection. However, in the 1960s, it was shown that animals produced a blood-carried ‘‘factor X’’ that acted upon the brain to cause sickness behavior.<ref>{{Cite PMID|14067912}}</ref><ref>Miller, N. (1964) "Some psychophysiological studies of motivation and of the behavioral effects of illness". Bull. Br. Psychol. Soc. 17: 1-20</ref> In 1987, Benjamin L. Hart brought together a variety of research findings that argued for them being [[evolutionary medicine|survival adaptations]] that if prevented would disadvantage an animal’s ability to fight infection. In the 1980s, the blood borne factor was shown to be proinflammatory [[cytokines]] produced by activated [[leukocytes]] in the [[immune system]] in response to [[lipopolysaccharides]] (a cell wall component of [[Gram-negative bacteria]]). These cytokines acted by various [[humoral]] and [[nerve]] routes upon the [[hypothalamus]] and other areas of the brain. Further research showed that the brain can also learn to control the various components of sickness behavior independently of  immune activation.

==Advantages==

===General advantage===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
Sickness behavior in its different aspects causes an animal to limit its movement; the metabolic energy not expended in activity is diverted to the fever responses, which involves raising body temperature.<ref  name="Hart"/>  This also limits an animal’s exposure to predators while it is cognitively and physically impaired.<ref name="Hart"/>

===Specific advantages===
The individual components of sickness behavior have specific individual advantages. Anorexia limits food ingestion and therefore reduces the availability of [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron]] in the gut (and from gut absorption). Iron may aid bacterial reproduction, so its reduction is useful during sickness.<ref>{{Cite PMID|760197}}</ref> Plasma concentrations of iron are lowered for this anti-bacterial reason in fever.<ref>{{Cite PMID|6420813}}</ref> [[pain threshold|Lowered threshold for pain]] ensures that an animal is attentive that it does not place pressure on injured and inflamed tissues that might disrupt their healing.<ref  name="Hart"/>  Reduced grooming is adaptive since it reduces water loss.<ref  name="Hart"/>

==Immune control==
Lipopolysaccharides trigger the [[immune system]] to produce [[proinflammatory cytokine]]s [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], and [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF).<ref name="Kent1992" /> These peripherally released cytokines act on the brain via a fast transmission pathway involving primary input through the [[vagus nerve]]s,<ref>{{Cite PMID|10087091}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|9227848}}</ref> and a slow transmission pathway involving cytokines originating from the [[choroid plexus]] and [[circumventricular organs]] and diffusing into the brain parenchyma by [[Neuromodulation#Diffuse modulatory neurotransmitter systems|volume transmission]].<ref>{{Cite PMID|10077334}}</ref> Peripheral cytokines may enter the brain directly.<ref>{{Cite PMID|7845624}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|1762091}}</ref> They may also induce the expression of other cytokines in the brain that cause sickness behavior.<ref>{{Cite PMID|1535519}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|1393581}}</ref> Acute psychosocial stress enhances the ability of an immune response to trigger both inflammation and behavioral sickness.<ref>{{Cite PMID |18835437}}</ref>

==Behavioral conditioning==
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
The components of sickness behavior can be learned by [[classical conditioning|conditional association]]. For example, if a [[saccharin]] solution is given with a chemical that triggers a particular aspect of sickness behavior, on later occasions the saccharin solution will trigger it by itself.<ref>{{Cite PMID|7716224}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|7777610}}</ref>

==Medical conditions==

===Depression===

It has been proposed that [[major depressive disorder]] is near-identical with sickness behavior, so raising the possibility that it is a maladaptive manifestation of sickness behavior due to abnormalities in circulating cytokines.<ref>{{Cite PMID|10442179}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|10790737}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|18073775}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|18580840}}</ref> Moreover, chronic, but not acute treatment with antidepressant drugs was found to attenuate sickness behavior symptoms in rodents.<ref>{{Cite PMID|8680860}}</ref> The mood effects caused by [[Interleukin 6|interleukin-6]] following an immune response have been linked to increased activity within the [[Brodmann area 25|subgenual anterior cingulate cortex]],<ref name="PMID 19423079">{{cite journal | author = Harrison NA, Brydon L, Walker C, Gray MA, Steptoe A, Critchley HD | title = Inflammation causes mood changes through alterations in subgenual cingulate activity and mesolimbic connectivity | journal = Biol Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 407–14 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19423079 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.03.015 | url = | pmc = 2885494 }}</ref> an area involved in the etiology of depression.<ref name="PMID 18704022">{{cite journal | author = Drevets WC, Savitz J, Trimble M | title = The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in mood disorders | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 663–81 | year = 2008 | month = August | pmid = 18704022 | pmc = 2729429 | url = http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1679}} PDF:http://mbldownloads.com/0808CNS_BrainRegions.pdf</ref>  Inflammation-associated mood change can also produce a reduction in the functional connectivity of this part of the brain to the [[amygdala]], [[medial prefrontal cortex]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and [[superior temporal sulcus]].<ref name="PMID 19423079"/>

===Cancer side effect===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
In cancer, both the disease and the [[chemotherapy]] treatment can cause proinflammatory cytokine release which can cause sickness behavior as a [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]].<ref>{{Cite PMID|12767108}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|18765326}}</ref>
