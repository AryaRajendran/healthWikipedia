'''Spermicide''' is a contraceptive substance that eradicates [[spermatozoon|sperm]], inserted vaginally prior to intercourse to prevent pregnancy. As a contraceptive, spermicide may be used alone.  However, the pregnancy rate experienced by couples using only spermicide is higher than that of couples using other methods.  Usually, spermicides are combined with contraceptive [[barrier method]]s such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[condom]]s, [[cervical cap]]s, and [[contraceptive sponge|sponges]].  Combined methods are believed to result in lower pregnancy rates than either method alone.<!--

Spermicides are unscented, clear, unflavored, non-staining, and lubricative.

==Types and effectiveness==
The most common active ingredient of spermicides is [[nonoxynol-9]]. Spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 are available in many forms, such as jelly (gel), films, and foams, but not recommended by the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]].  Spermicides cause irritation and according to the CDC, studies have shown that spermicides increase the risk of HIV.  ''Contraceptive Technology'' states that spermicides have a failure rate of 18% per year when used correctly and consistently, and 29% under typical use.<!--

[[Octoxynol-9]] was previously a common spermicide, but was removed from the U.S. market in 2002 after manufacturers failed to perform new studies required by the FDA.<!--

[[Lactic acid]] preparations have also been shown to have some spermicidal effect, and commercial lactic acid-based spermicides are available.<!--

==Use with condoms==
Spermicides are believed to increase the contraceptive effectiveness of condoms.<ref name="simultaneous" />  

However, condoms that are spermicidally lubricated by the manufacturer have a shorter shelf life<ref>{{cite web |title=Spermicide (Nonoxynol-9) |work=Other disadvantages |url=http://www.condomjungle.com/Spermicidal_Nonoxynol_9_Lubricated_Condoms_s/61.htm |accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref> and may cause urinary-tract infections in women.<!--

However, they recommend using a nonoxynol-9 lubricated condom over no condom at all.<!--

==Side effects==
[[Nonoxynol-9]] has a number of possible side effects.  These include irritation, itching, or the sensation of burning of the sex organs (either partner), and in women, [[urinary tract infection]]s, [[Candidiasis|yeast infection]], and [[bacterial vaginosis]].<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web |title=Drug Information: Nonoxynol-9 cream, film, foam, gel, jelly, suppository |work=Medical University of South Carolina  |month=March | year=2006
  |url=http://www.muschealth.com/cds/CPDrugInfo.details.aspx?cpnum=1477&language=english |accessdate=2006-08-06 }}</ref> These side effects are uncommon; one study found that only 3-5% of women who try spermicides discontinue use due to side effects.<!--

Concern has been raised over possible increased risk of birth defects in children conceived despite spermicide use, and also in children of women who, not yet aware of their condition, continued spermicide use during early pregnancy.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |author=|title=Study raises question of spermicide safety | journal = Contracept Technol Update | volume = 2 | issue = 5 |pages=57–61 |year=1981 | pmid = 12265917}}</ref> However, a review in 1990 of large studies on spermicides concluded "''there appears to be no increased risk of congenital anomalies, altered sex ratio, or early pregnancy loss among spermicide users.''"<!--

==History==
The first written record of spermicide use is found in the [[Kahun Papyrus]],<!-- or Petri Papyrus?  Sources for these (two?) documents seem to be pretty sketchy --> an Egyptian document dating to 1850 BCE.  It described a [[pessary]] of crocodile dung and fermented dough.<!--

Further formulations are found in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] from approximately 1500 BCE.  It recommended mixing seed wool, acacia, dates and honey, and placing the mixture in the vagina. It probably had some effectiveness, in part as a physical barrier due to the thick, sticky consistency, and also because of the [[lactic acid]] (a known spermicide) formed from the acacia.<ref name="museum" />

Writings by [[Soranus (Greek physician)|Soranus]], a 2nd century Greek physician, contained formulations for a number of acidic concoctions claimed to be spermicidal.  His instructions were to soak wool in one of the mixtures, then place near the cervix.<ref name="evolution" />

Laboratory testing of substances to see if they inhibited sperm motility began in the 1800s.  Modern spermicides nonoxynol-9 and menfegol were developed from this line of research.<ref name="evolution" /> However, many other substances of dubious contraceptive value were also promoted.  Especially after the prohibition of contraception in the U.S. by the 1873 [[Comstock laws|Comstock Act]], spermicides—the most popular of which was [[Lysol]]—were marketed only as "feminine hygiene" products and were not held to any standard of effectiveness.  Worse, many manufacturers recommended using the products as a [[douche]] ''after'' intercourse, too late to affect all the sperm.  Medical estimates during the 1930s placed the pregnancy rate of women using many over-the-counter spermicides at seventy percent per year.<!--
