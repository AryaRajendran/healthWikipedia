'''Alexithymia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|eɪ|l|ɛ|k|s|ə|ˈ|θ|aɪ|m|i|ə}}) is a personality construct characterized by the sub-clinical inability to identify and describe emotions in the self.<ref>Sifneos PE.

The term alexithymia was coined by  psychotherapist Peter Sifneos in 1973.<ref name= Bar-On>{{cite book |last=Bar-On |first=Reuven |coauthors=Parker, James DA |year=2000 |title=The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace |location=San Francisco, California |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=0-7879-4984-1}} pp. 40–59</ref><ref name=Taylor2831>Taylor GJ & Taylor HS (1997).

==Classification==
Alexithymia is considered to be a [[personality trait]] that places individuals at risk for other medical and psychiatric disorders while reducing the likelihood that these individuals will respond to conventional treatments for the other conditions.<ref name=Haviland>{{cite journal |author=Haviland MG, Warren WL, Riggs ML |title=An observer scale to measure alexithymia |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=385–92 |year=2000 |pmid=11015624 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/5/385#R26732 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.41.5.385}}</ref>  Alexithymia is not classified as a mental disorder in the [[DSM-IV]]. It is a dimensional personality trait that varies in severity from person to person. A person's alexithymia score can be measured with questionnaires such as the [[Toronto Alexithymia Scale]] (TAS-20), the [[Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire]] (BVAQ),<ref>Vorst HCM, Bermond B (February 2001).

Alexithymia is defined by:<ref name=Taylor29>Taylor (1997), p. 29</ref>
# difficulty identifying feelings and distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal
# difficulty describing feelings to other people
# constricted imaginal processes, as evidenced by a scarcity of fantasies
# a stimulus-bound, externally oriented cognitive style.

In studies of the general population the degree of alexithymia was found to be influenced by age, but not by gender; the rates of alexithymia in healthy controls have been found at: 8.3% (2 of 24 persons); 4.7% (2 of 43); 8.9% (16 of 179); and 7% (4 of 56). Thus, several studies have reported that the prevalence rate of alexithymia is less than 10%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fukunishi I, Berger D, Wogan J, Kuboki T |title=Alexithymic traits as predictors of difficulties with adjustment in an outpatient cohort of expatriates in Tokyo |journal=Psychological reports |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=67–77 |year=1999 |pmid=10575975 |url=http://www.japanpsychiatrist.com/Abstracts/Expats1.html |accessdate=2007-08-10 |doi= 10.2466/PR0.85.5.67-77}}</ref> A less common finding suggests that there may be a higher prevalence of alexithymia amongst males than females, which may be accounted for by difficulties some males have with "describing feelings", but not by difficulties in "identifying feelings" in which males and females show similar abilities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salminen JK, Saarijärvi S, Aärelä E, Toikka T, Kauhanen J |title=Prevalence of alexithymia and its association with sociodemographic variables in the general population of Finland |journal=Journal of psychosomatic research |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=75–82 |year=1999 |pmid=10088984 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(98)00053-1}}</ref> 
 
Psychologist [[R. Michael Bagby]] and psychiatrist Graeme J. Taylor have argued that the alexithymia construct is strongly related (negatively) to the concepts of [[psychological mindedness]]<ref>Taylor & Taylor (1997), pp. 77–104</ref> and emotional intelligence<ref>Taylor (1997), p. 38</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00014-3 | last1 = Parker | first1 = JDA | last2 = Taylor | first2 = GJ | last3 = Bagby | first3 = RM | year = 2001 | title = The Relationship Between Emotional Intelligence and Alexithymia | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 107–115 }}</ref> and there is "strong empirical support for alexithymia being a stable personality [[trait theory|trait]] rather than just a consequence of psychological distress".<ref name="Taylor 1997, p. 37">Taylor (1997), p. 37</ref> Other opinions differ and can show evidence that it may be state-dependent.<ref name=Honkalampi>{{cite journal |author=Honkalampi K, Hintikka J, Laukkanen E, Lehtonen J, Viinamäki H |title=Alexithymia and depression: a prospective study of patients with major depressive disorder |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=229–34 |year=2001 |pmid=11351111 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/3/229 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.42.3.229}}</ref>

Bagby and Taylor also suggest that there may be two kinds of alexithymia, "primary alexithymia" which is an enduring psychological trait that does not alter over time, and "secondary alexithymia" which is state-dependent and disappears after the evoking stressful situation has changed. These two manifestations of alexithymia are otherwise called "trait" or "state" alexithymia.<ref name="Taylor 1997, p. 37"/>

==Description==
Typical deficiencies may include problems identifying, describing, and working with one's own [[feeling]]s, often marked by a lack of understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal;<ref name=Bar-On/> confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few [[dream]]s or [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] due to restricted [[imagination]]; and concrete, realistic, [[logic]]al thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krystal H |title= Alexithymia and psychotherapy |journal=American journal of psychotherapy |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=17–31 |year=1979 |pmid=464164}}</ref> Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of [[dream]]s more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.<ref name=Bar-On/>

Some alexithymic individuals may appear to contradict the above mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic [[dysphoria]] or manifest outbursts of crying or rage.<ref>Nemiah et al. (1970), pp. 432–33</ref><ref>Krystal (1988), p. 246; McDougall (1985), pp. 169–70</ref><ref>Taylor (1997), pp. 29, 246–47</ref> However, questioning usually reveals that they are quite incapable of describing their feelings or appear confused by questions inquiring about specifics of feelings.<ref name=Taylor29/>  

According to Henry Krystal, individuals suffering from alexithymia think in an operative way and may appear to be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail.<ref>Krystal (1988) pp. 246-247</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nemiah | first1 = CJ | year = 1978 | title = Alexithymia and Psychosomatic Illness | url = | journal = Journal of Continuing Education | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 25–37 }}</ref> In general, these individuals lack [[imagination]], intuition, [[empathy]], and drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.<ref name=Taylor29/>

A common misconception about alexithymia is that affected individuals are totally unable to express emotions verbally and that they may even fail to acknowledge that they experience emotions. Even before coining the term, Sifneos (1967) noted patients often mentioned things like anxiety or depression. The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as "happy" or "unhappy" when describing these feelings.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sifneos | first1 = PE | year = 1967 | title = Clinical Observations on some patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic diseases | url = | journal = Acta Medicina Psychosomatica | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–10 }}</ref> The core issue is that alexithymics have poorly differentiated emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe them to others.<ref name=Bar-On/> This contributes to the sense of emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with others, making alexithymia negatively associated with life satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors are controlled for.<ref>Mattila, AK, Poutanen O, Koivisto AM, Salokangas RKR, Joukamaa M. "Alexithymia and Life Satisfaction in Primary Healthcare Patients". Psychosomatics 48:523-529, December 2007</ref>

==Causes==
It is unclear what causes alexithymia, though several theories have been proposed. There is evidence both for a genetic basis, meaning some people are predisposed to develop alexithymia, as well as for environmental causes.

Early studies showed evidence that there may be an interhemispheric transfer deficit among alexithymics; that is, the emotional information from the right hemisphere is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased [[corpus callosum]], often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoppe KD, Bogen JE |title=Alexithymia in twelve commissurotomized patients |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=28 |issue=1–4 |pages=148–55 |year=1977 |pmid=609675 |doi=10.1159/000287057}}</ref> A [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] study in 1997 indicated that alexithymia may be due to a disturbance to the right hemisphere of the [[Human brain|brain]], which is largely responsible for processing emotions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jessimer M, Markham R |title=Alexithymia: a right hemisphere dysfunction specific to recognition of certain facial expressions? |journal=Brain and cognition |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=246–58 |year=1997 |pmid=9220088 |doi=10.1006/brcg.1997.0900}}</ref> In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that alexithymia may be related to a dysfunction of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lane RD, Ahern GL, Schwartz GE, Kaszniak AW |title=Is alexithymia the emotional equivalent of blindsight? |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=834–44 |year=1997 |pmid=9347133 |doi= 10.1016/S0006-3223(97)00050-4}}</ref> These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the causes of alexithymia remains inconclusive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tabibnia G, Zaidel E |title=Alexithymia, interhemispheric transfer, and right hemispheric specialization: a critical review |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=81–92 |year=2005 |pmid=15741757 |doi=10.1159/000083166}}</ref> French psychoanalyst Joyce McDougall objected to the strong focus by clinicians on neurophysiological at the expense of psychological explanations for the genesis and operation of alexithymia, and introduced the alternative term "[[disaffectation]]" to stand for psychogenic alexithymia.<ref>McDougall (1989), pp. 93, 103</ref> For McDougall, the disaffected individual had at some point "experienced overwhelming emotion that threatened to attack their sense of integrity and identity", to which they applied psychological defenses to pulverize and eject all emotional representations from consciousness.<ref>McDougall (1989), pp. 93–94</ref>  A similar line of interpretation has been taken up using the methods of [[phenomenology]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maclaren K |title=Emotional Disorder and the Mind-Body Problem: A Case Study of Alexithymia |journal=Chiasmi International |volume=8 |pages=139–55 |year=2006}}</ref>  

McDougall has also noted that all infants are born unable to identify, organize, and speak about their emotional experiences (the word ''infans'' is from the Latin "not speaking"), and are "by reason of their immaturity inevitably alexithymic".<ref name=McDougall161>McDougall (1985), p. 161</ref> Based on this fact McDougall proposed in 1985 that the alexithymic part of an adult personality could be "an extremely arrested and infantile psychic structure".<ref name=McDougall161/> The first language of an infant is nonverbal facial expressions. The mother's emotional state is important for determining how any child might develop. Neglect or indifference to varying changes in a child's facial expressions without proper feedback can promote an invalidation of the facial expressions manifested by the child. The parent's ability to reflect self-awareness to the child is another important factor. If the adult is incapable of recognizing and distinguishing emotional expressions in the child, it can influence the child's capacity to understand emotional expressions.<ref name=Bar-On/>

Although environmental, neurological, and genetic factors are each involved, the role of genetic and environmental factors for developing alexithymia is still unclear.<ref name= ReferenceA>Jørgensen MM, Zachariae R, Skytthe A, Kyvik K.: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17917473 Genetic and Environmental Factors in Alexithymia: A Population-Based Study of 8,785 Danish Twin Pairs.] Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics 2007;76:369-375 {{doi|10.1159/000107565}}</ref> The results from a large population-based sample of Danish twins suggested that genetic factors contributed noticeably to the development of alexithymia. While the results suggested a moderate influence of environmental factors that were shared between twin pairs, the authors found that non-shared environmental influences had the greatest impact on psychological traits, which was consist with earlier findings.{{elucidate|date=February 2013}}<ref name=ReferenceA/> One hypothesized environmental cause is head injury; persons suffering a [[traumatic brain injury]] are six times more likely to exhibit alexithymia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams C, Wood RL |title=Alexithymia and emotional empathy following traumatic brain injury |journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol |pages=1–11 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19548166 |doi= 10.1080/13803390902976940 |laysummary=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/201001/traumatic-brain-injury-leads-problems-emotional-processing |laysource=Psychology Today |laydate=January 3, 2010 |volume=32 |issue=3}}</ref>

==Relational issues==
Alexithymia creates interpersonal problems because these individuals avoid emotionally close relationships, or if they ''do'' form relationships with others they tend to position themselves as either dependent, dominant, or impersonal, "such that the relationship remains superficial".<ref name=Vanheule>{{cite journal |author=Vanheule S, Desmet M, Meganck R, Bogaerts S |title=Alexithymia and interpersonal problems |journal=Journal of clinical psychology |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages= 109–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17016830 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20324}}</ref> Inadequate "differentiation" between self and others by alexithymic individuals has also been observed.<ref>Blaustein JP, Tuber SB (1998). Knowing the Unspeakeable. Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, 62, 351–365; and Taylor (1997) pp. 26-46</ref>

In a study, a large group of alexithymic individuals completed the 64-item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64) which found that "two interpersonal problems are significantly and stably related to alexithymia: cold/distant and non-assertive social functioning. All other IIP-64 subscales were not significantly related to alexithymia."<ref name=Vanheule/>

Chaotic interpersonal relations have also been observed by Sifneos.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sifneos PE |title=Alexithymia: past and present |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=137–42 |year=1996 |pmid=8659637}}</ref> Due to the inherent difficulties identifying and describing emotional states in self and others, alexithymia also negatively affects relationship satisfaction between couples.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yelsma P, Marrow S |title=An Examination of Couples' Difficulties With Emotional Expressiveness and Their Marital Satisfaction |journal=Journal of Family Communication |year=2003 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=41–62 |doi=10.1207/S15327698JFC0301_03}}</ref>

In a 2008 study<ref name="Colin Hesse 2008">Colin Hesse & Kory Floyd: Affectionate experience mediates the effects of alexithymia on mental health and interpersonal relationships, ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'', Vol. 25, No. 5, 793-810 (2008) {{doi|10.1177/0265407508096696}}</ref> alexithymia was found to be correlated with impaired understanding and demonstration of relational affection, and that this impairment contributes to poorer mental health, poorer relational well-being, and lowered relationship quality.<ref name="Colin Hesse 2008"/> Individuals high on the alexithymia spectrum also report less distress at seeing others in pain and behave less altruistically toward others.<ref name = Feldman />

Some individuals working for organizations in which control of emotions is the norm might show alexithymic-like behavior but not be alexithymic. However, over time the lack of self-expression becomes part of their everyday lives and they end up losing their original self-identity.<ref>Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries (2001) "Struggling with the Demon: Perspectives on Individual and Organizational Irrationality"</ref>

==Comorbid medical and psychiatric illness==

An inability to modulate emotions is a possibility in explaining why some alexithymics are prone to discharge tension arising from unpleasant emotional states through impulsive acts or compulsive behaviors such as [[binge eating]],<ref name=Taylor190216>Taylor (1997), pp. 190–216</ref> [[substance abuse]],<ref>Taylor (1997), pp. 166–190</ref> perverse [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]], or the self-starvation of [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref name=Taylor190216/> The failure to regulate emotions cognitively might result in prolonged elevations of the [[autonomic nervous system]] (ANS) and [[neuroendocrine system]]s which can lead to [[somatic]] diseases.<ref name=Taylor216248/> Alexithymics also show a limited ability to experience positive emotions leading Krystal (1988) and Sifneos (1987) to describe many of these individuals as [[anhedonia|anhedonic]].<ref name=Taylor2831/>
