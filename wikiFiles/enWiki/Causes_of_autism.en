==Autism and related disorders==
{{main|Autism}}

[[Autism]] involves [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|abnormalities of brain development]] and behavior which become apparent before a child is three years old and have a steady course with no [[remission (medicine)|remission]]. It is characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted interests and stereotyped behavior, and the characterization is independent of any underlying neurological defects. It is part of a larger family called [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which include closely related disorders such as [[Asperger syndrome]] and [[PDD-NOS]].<ref>{{vcite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |chapterurl=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/overview_diagnostic_criteria.htm#Autistic |accessdate=2009-02-17 |publisher=<!--comment to foil Citation bot-->|location= <!--comment to foil Citation bot-->}}</ref><ref>{{vcite book |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems |edition=10th ([[ICD-10]]) |author= [[World Health Organization]] |chapter= F84.

The consensus among mainstream autism researchers is that genetic factors predominate. Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to autism or exacerbate its symptoms, or may be important to consider in future research, include certain foods,<ref name=Christison/> [[infectious disease]], [[heavy metals]], [[solvent]]s, [[diesel exhaust]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[phthalates]] and [[phenol]]s used in [[plastic]] products, [[pesticide]]s, [[brominated flame retardant]]s, [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[smoking]], [[illicit drug]]s, and [[vaccine]]s.<ref name=Newschaffer/> Among these factors, vaccines have attracted much attention, as parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination, and parental concern about vaccines has led to a decreasing uptake of [[childhood immunizations]] and an increasing likelihood of [[Measles#Public health|measles outbreaks]]. However, there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing no causal association between the [[MMR vaccine controversy|measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism]], and there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine preservative [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal]] helps cause autism.<ref name=Doja>{{vcite journal|journal=Can J Neurol Sci|year=2006|volume=33|issue=4|pages=341–6|title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature|author=Doja A, Roberts W|pmid=17168158}}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Child Care Health Dev |year=2006 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=511–9 |title= Vaccines and the changing epidemiology of autism |author= Taylor B |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00655.x |pmid=16919130}}</ref>

==Genetics==
{{main|Heritability of autism}}

Genetic factors may be the most significant cause for autism spectrum disorders. Early studies of twins had estimated [[heritability]] to be over 90%, meaning that genetics explains over 90% of whether a child will develop autism.<ref name=Freitag/> However, this may be an overestimate, as new twin data and models with structural genetic variation are needed.<ref name=Sykes/> Many of the non-autistic co-twins had learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings the risk for having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B|title=Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder|journal=Nat Rev Genet|year=2001|volume=2|issue=12|pages=943–55|doi=10.1038/35103559|pmid=11733747}}</ref>

Though autism's genetic factors explain most of the risk of developing autism, they do not explain all of it. A common hypothesis is that autism is caused by the interaction of a genetic predisposition and an early environmental insult.<ref name=Trottier>{{vcite journal |author= Trottier G, Srivastava L, Walker CD |title= Etiology of infantile autism: a review of recent advances in genetic and neurobiological research |journal= J Psychiatry Neurosci |year=1999 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=103–115 |pmid=10212552 |pmc=1188990}}</ref> Several theories based on environmental factors have been proposed to address the remaining risk. Some of these theories focus on prenatal environmental factors, such as agents that cause birth defects, and others focus on the environment after birth, such as children's diets.

[[Risk factors]] for autism include parental characteristics such as [[advanced maternal age]] and [[advanced paternal age]].<ref name=Gardener>{{vcite journal |author=Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL |title=Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |year=2009 |pmid=19567888 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672 }}</ref> The risk is greater for advanced paternal age. One hypothesis is that this is caused by older sperm that have greater mutation burden, and another is that men who carry more genetic liability have some features of autism and therefore marry and have children later. These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.<ref name="Geschwind DH 2009 367–80"/>  
In the largest study of this kind as of 2012, a whole [[genome sequencing]] of 78 families in [[Iceland]] showed that the number of mutations in children increased with the age of the father.  Not only the fathers passed on nearly four times as many new mutations as the mothers, the number of new mutations being passed on rose exponentially with paternal age.  Increased mutations will increase the risk of the children developing autism, [[schizophrenia]] and other diseases often linked to destructive mutations.  <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Callaway|first1=Ewen|title=Fathers bequeath more mutations as they age|journal=Nature|volume=488|issue=7412|page=439|year=2012|publisher=Nature|doi= 10.1038/488439a|url= http://www.nature.com/news/fathers-bequeath-more-mutations-as-they-age-1.11247}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stefansson|first1=Kari|last2=Kong|first2=Augustine|last3=Frigge|first3=Michael

==Prenatal environment==
The risk of autism is associated with several [[prenatal]] risk factors, including advanced age in either parent, diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.<ref name=Gardener/> Autism has been linked to birth defect agents acting during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]], though these cases are rare.<ref name=Szpir/>

A child's risk of developing autism is associated with the age of his or her mother and father at birth.<ref name=Gardener/><ref>{{vcite journal |author=Durkin MS, Maenner MJ, Newschaffer CJ ''et al.'' |title=Advanced parental age and the risk of autism spectrum disorder |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=168 |issue=11 |pages=1268–76 |year=2008 |pmid=18945690 |pmc=2638544 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwn250 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/168/11/1268 }}</ref><ref name=Shelton>{{vcite journal |author=Shelton JF, Tancredi DJ, [[Irva Hertz-Picciotto|Hertz-Picciotto I]] |title=Independent and dependent contributions of advanced maternal and paternal ages to autism risk |journal=Autism Res |year=2010 |pmid=20143326 |doi=10.1002/aur.116 }}</ref> The biological reasons for this are unknown: possible explanations include increased risk of pregnancy complications;<ref name=Gardener/> maternal [[autoimmunity]];<ref name=Shelton/> increased risk of [[chromosomal abnormalities]] or unstable [[trinucleotide repeat]]s in the egg; and [[imprinted gene]]s, [[spontaneous mutation]]s, and confounding sociocultural factors in the sperm.{{clarify|date=October 2010}} Since ages of the father and mother are correlated, it is possible that only the mother's age, or only the father's age, or both, contribute to the risk.<ref name=Gardener/>

===Infectious processes===
Prenatal viral infection has been called the principal non-genetic cause of autism. Prenatal exposure to [[rubella]] or [[cytomegalovirus]] activates the mother's [[immune response]] and greatly increases the risk for autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Patterson PH |title= Immune involvement in schizophrenia and autism: etiology, pathology and animal models |journal= Behav Brain Res |volume= 204|issue= 2|pages= 313–21|year=2008 |pmid=19136031 |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.12.016}}</ref> [[Congenital rubella syndrome]] is the most convincing environmental cause.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Semin Pediatr Neurol |year=2008 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=27–31 |title= Genetic evaluation of autism |author= Mendelsohn NJ, Schaefer GB |doi=10.1016/j.spen.2008.01.005 |pmid=18342258}}</ref> Infection-associated immunological events in early pregnancy may affect neural development more than infections in late pregnancy, not only for autism, but also for other psychiatric disorders of presumed neurodevelopmental origin, notably [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Neuroscientist |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=241–56|title= The neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal infections at different times of pregnancy: the earlier the worse? |author= Meyer U, Yee BK, Feldon J |pmid=17519367 |doi=10.1177/1073858406296401}}</ref>

===Environmental agents===
[[Teratogen]]s are environmental agents that cause [[birth defect]]s. Some agents that are theorized to cause other birth defects have also been suggested as potential autism risk factors, although there is little to no scientific evidence to back such claims. These include exposure of the embryo to [[thalidomide]], [[valproic acid]], or [[misoprostol]]. These cases are rare.<ref name=Szpir>{{vcite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year=2006 |volume=114 |issue=7 |pages=A412–8 |title= Tracing the origins of autism: a spectrum of new studies |author= Szpir M |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/114-7/focus.html |pmid=16835042 |pmc= 1513312 |doi=10.1289/ehp.114-a412}}</ref> Questions have also been raised whether [[ethanol]] (grain alcohol) increases autism risk, as part of [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] or alcohol-related birth defects, but evidence is insufficient to determine whether autism risk is actually elevated with ethanol.<ref>{{vcite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|year=2002|volume=32|issue=3|pages=243|title=Is exposure to alcohol during pregnancy a risk factor for autism |author=Fombonne E|doi=10.1023/A:1015466100838|pmid=12108626}}</ref> All known teratogens appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.<ref name=Arndt>{{vcite journal|journal=Int J Dev Neurosci|year=2005|volume=23|issue=2–3|pages=189–99|title=The teratology of autism|author=Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM|doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001|pmid=15749245}}</ref>

===Other maternal conditions===
Diabetes in the mother during pregnancy is a significant risk factor for autism; a 2009 meta-analysis found that [[gestational diabetes]] was associated with a twofold increased risk. Although diabetes causes metabolic and hormonal abnormalities and [[oxidative stress]], no biological mechanism is known for the association between gestational diabetes and autism risk.<ref name=Gardener/>
A case control study <ref name=krakowiak>{{cite journal|last=Krakowiak|first=Paula|title=Maternal Metabolic Conditions and Risk for Autism and Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders|journal=Pediatrics|year=2012|month=April|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/04/04/peds.2011-2583.abstract?sid=29b39ccf-afce-4b8f-bac6-d261190ef194}}</ref> in April 2012 found that metabolic conditions (obesity, hypertension or diabetes) could be more frequent among mothers of ASD children than mothers of typical development children odds ratio: 1.61 significant. Obesity alone was significant. However, hypertension and diabetes were more frequent but this was not significant.

[[Thyroid]] problems that lead to [[thyroxine]] deficiency in the mother in weeks 8–12 of pregnancy have been postulated to produce changes in the fetal brain leading to autism. Thyroxine deficiencies can be caused by inadequate [[iodine]] in the diet, and by environmental agents that [[Goitrogen|interfere with iodine uptake]] or [[Antithyroid agent|act against thyroid hormones]]. Possible environmental agents include [[flavonoid]]s in food, [[tobacco smoke]], and most [[herbicide]]s. This hypothesis has not been tested.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Román GC |title=Autism: transient ''in utero'' hypothyroxinemia related to maternal flavonoid ingestion during pregnancy and to other environmental antithyroid agents |journal= J Neurol Sci |volume=262 |issue=1–2 |pages=15–26 |year=2007 |pmid=17651757 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.023}}</ref> A related untested hypothesis is that exposure to pesticides could combine with suboptimal iodine nutrition in a pregnant mother and lead to autism in the child.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Sullivan KM |title=The interaction of agricultural pesticides and marginal iodine nutrition status as a cause of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Environ Health Perspect |volume=116 |issue=4 |pages=A155 |year=2008 |pmid=18414608 |pmc=2291008 |doi=10.1289/ehp.11010 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2008/11010/letter.html }}</ref>

===Other ''in utero''===
It has been hypothesized that [[folic acid]] taken during pregnancy could play a role in causing autism by modulating [[gene expression]] through an [[epigenetic]] mechanism. This hypothesis is untested.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= J Nutr Biochem |year=2006 |volume=17 |issue=11 |pages=717–27 |title= Folate and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in psychiatric disease |author= Muskiet FA, Kemperman RF |doi=10.1016/j.jnutbio.2006.02.001 |pmid=16650750}}</ref>

[[Prenatal stress]], consisting of exposure to life events or environmental factors that distress an expectant mother, has been hypothesized to contribute to autism, possibly as part of a gene-environment interaction. Autism has been reported to be associated with prenatal stress both with retrospective studies that examined stressors such as job loss and family discord, and with natural experiments involving prenatal exposure to storms; animal studies have reported that prenatal stress can disrupt brain development and produce behaviors resembling symptoms of autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |year=2008 |title= Prenatal stress and risk for autism |author= Kinney DK, Munir KM, Crowley DJ, Miller AM |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.06.004 |pmid=18598714 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=1519–32 |pmc= 2632594}}</ref>

The fetal testosterone theory hypothesizes that higher levels of [[testosterone]] in the [[amniotic fluid]] of mothers pushes brain development towards improved ability to see patterns and analyze complex systems while diminishing communication and empathy, emphasizing "male" traits over "female", or in [[E-S theory]] terminology, emphasizing "systemizing" over "empathizing".

==Perinatal environment==
Autism is associated with some [[perinatal]] and [[obstetric]] conditions. A 2007 review of [[risk factors]] found associated obstetric conditions that included [[low birth weight]] and [[gestation]] duration, and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] during [[childbirth]].

==Postnatal environment==
A wide variety of postnatal contributors to autism have been proposed, including gastrointestinal or immune system abnormalities, allergies, and exposure of children to drugs, vaccines, infection, certain foods, or heavy metals. The evidence for these risk factors is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies.<ref name=Rutter>{{vcite journal|author=Rutter M|title=Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning|journal=Acta Paediatr|volume=94|issue=1|year=2005|pages=2–15|pmid=15858952|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x|authorlink=Michael Rutter}}</ref> The subject remains [[Controversies in autism|controversial]] and extensive further searches for environmental factors are underway.<ref name=Szpir/>

===Opiate theory===
In 1979, [[Jaak Panksepp]] proposed a connection between autism and opiates, noting that injections of minute quantities of opiates in young laboratory animals induce symptoms similar to those observed among autistic children.<ref>Panksepp, J. (1979) A neurochemical theory of autism. Trends in Neurosciences, 2, 174-177</ref> Opiate Theory hypothesizes that autism is caused by a digestive disorder present from birth which causes gluten (present in wheat-derived foods) and casein (present in dairy products) to be converted to the opioid peptides [[gliadorphin]] (aka gluteomorphin), and [[casomorphin]]. 

According to the theory, exposure to these opiate compounds in young children interferes with normal neurological development by dulling sensory input. Lacking sufficient sensory input, the developing brain attempts to artificially generate the auditory, vestibular, visual, and tactile input on its own. This attempt at generating input manifests itself as behaviors common to autism, such as grunting or screaming (auditory), spinning or rocking back and forth (vestibular), preoccupation with spinning objects or waving of the fingers in front of the eyes (visual), and hand flapping or self-injury (tactile).

The theory further states that removing opiate precursors from a child's diet may allow time for these behaviors to cease, and neurological development in very young children to resume normally.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |year=2006 |volume=27 |issue=2 Suppl 2 |pages=S162–71 |title= Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the chaff? |author= Christison GW, Ivany K |pmid=16685183 |doi= 10.1097/00004703-200604002-00015}}</ref> The possibility of a relationship between autism and the consumption of gluten and casein was first articulated by [[Kalle Reichelt]] in 1991.<ref>Reichelt KL, Knivsberg A-M, Lind G, Nødland M.

===Mercury===
This theory hypothesizes that autism is associated with [[mercury poisoning]], based on perceived similarity of symptoms and reports of mercury or its biomarkers in some autistic children.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Int J Risk Saf Med |year=2008 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=135–42 |title=An epidemiological analysis of the 'autism as mercury poisoning' hypothesis |author= Austin D |doi=10.3233/JRS-2008-0436 }}</ref> This view has gained little traction in the scientific community as the [[Mercury_toxicity#Signs_and_symptoms|typical symptoms of mercury toxicity]] are significantly different than [[Autism#Characteristics|symptoms seen in autism]].<ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal |author= Nelson KB, Bauman ML |title= Thimerosal and autism? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=674–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12612255 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.3.674 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/111/3/674}}</ref>  The principal source of human exposure to organic mercury is via fish consumption and for inorganic mercury is [[dental amalgam]]s.

===Vaccines===
The scientific consensus is that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Gross L |title=A broken trust: lessons from the vaccine–autism wars |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e1000114 |year=2009 |pmid=19478850 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000114 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000114 |pmc=2682483 }}</ref> Despite this, many parents believe that vaccinations cause autism and therefore delay or avoid immunizing their children under the "[[Vaccine controversy#Vaccine overload|vaccine overload]]" hypothesis that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm a child's immune system and lead to autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K |title='Combined vaccines are like a sudden onslaught to the body's immune system': parental concerns about vaccine 'overload' and 'immune-vulnerability' |journal=Vaccine |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=4321–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16581162 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.03.003 }}</ref> even though this hypothesis has no scientific evidence and is biologically implausible.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Gerber JS, Offit PA |title=Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=456–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19128068 |doi=10.1086/596476 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476 |laysummary=http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=13336 |laysource=IDSA |laydate=2009-01-30 |pmc=2908388}}</ref> A study published in the [[Journal of Pediatrics]] on April 2013 found no correlation between autism and the [[antigen]] number in the vaccines the children were administered up to the age of two.

The vaccine schedule in 2012 contains several more vaccines but the number of antigens the child is exposed to by the age of two is 315.

====Thiomersal====
{{main|Thiomersal controversy}}

Perhaps the best-known hypothesis involving mercury and autism involves the use of the mercury-based compound [[thiomersal]], a preservative that has been phased out from most childhood [[vaccination]]s in developed countries such as the USA.<ref>{{vcite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm096228.htm#thi| title= The Feds say it ain't so}}</ref> Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination.

====MMR vaccine====
{{main|MMR vaccine controversy}}

The [[MMR vaccine]] theory of autism is one of the most extensively debated theories regarding the origins of autism. [[Andrew Wakefield]] ''et al.'' reported a study of 12 children who had [[autism]] and bowel symptoms, in some cases reportedly with onset after MMR.<ref name=full-retraction/> Although the paper, which was later retracted by the journal,<ref name="full-retraction"/> concluded "We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described,"<ref name=Wakefield1998>{{vcite journal |author= [[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]], Murch S, Anthony A ''et al.''  |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–41 |year=1998 | note = doi was 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 and URL was http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|pmid=9500320 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0}}{{Retracted paper|{{DOI|10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-7}}|intentional=yes}}</ref> Wakefield nevertheless suggested during a 1998 press conference that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single dose. This suggestion has been heavily criticized, both on scientific grounds and for triggering a decline in vaccination rates.<ref name=Doja/> Using separate, single vaccines in place of MMR is widely believed to put children at increased risk since the combined vaccine reduces the risk of them catching the diseases while they are waiting for full immunization cover.<ref>{{vcite web|url=http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/basics/truths.php|title=MMR the facts|publisher=NHS|accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> Numerous peer-reviewed studies have also since failed to show any association between MMR vaccine and autism.<ref name=Doja/>

In 2004, the interpretation of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism was formally retracted by ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH ''et al.'' |author.= |title= Retraction of an interpretation |year=2004 |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |pages=750 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2 |pmid=15016483}}</ref> The retraction followed an investigation by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', which stated that Wakefield "acted dishonestly and irresponsibly".<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm |title= The MMR-autism crisis - our story so far |accessdate=2008-12-06 |author= Deer B |date=2008-11-02}}</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]],<ref name=CDC>{{vcite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/mmr_vaccine.htm |title= Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]],<ref name=IOM2004>{{vcite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/20155.aspx |title= Immunization safety review: vaccines and autism |publisher= Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> and the U.K. [[National Health Service]]<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/ |accessdate=2007-06-13 |title= MMR the facts |publisher= National Health Service}}</ref> have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

In July 2007 Andrew Wakefield and coauthors John Walker-Smith and Simon Murch faced charges of serious professional misconduct at the [[General Medical Council]]. It is alleged that the trio acted unethically in preparing the research into safety of the MMR vaccine. Wakefield denies the charges.<ref>{{vcite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6289166.stm|accessdate=2007-07-29|title=MMR scare doctor 'paid children'|date=2007-07-16|work=BBC News}}</ref> In February 2009 ''The Sunday Times'' reported that Wakefield had manipulated patient data and misreported results in his 1998 paper, creating the appearance of a link with autism.<ref name=Deer2009>{{vcite news |author=Deer B |title=MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece |work= Sunday Times |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-02-09 | location=London}}</ref>

===Autoimmune disease===
This theory hypothesizes that autoantibodies that target the brain or elements of brain metabolism may cause or exacerbate autism. It is related to the [[#Maternal infection|maternal infection]] theory, except that it postulates that the effect is caused by the individual's own antibodies, possibly due to an environmental trigger after birth. It is also related to several other hypothesized causes; for example, [[#Viral infection|viral infection]] has been hypothesized to cause autism via an autoimmune mechanism.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Autoimmun Rev |year=2004 |volume=3 |issue=7–8 |pages=557–62 |title= Is autism an autoimmune disease? |title.= |author= Ashwood P, Van de Water J |doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2004.07.036 |pmid=15546805}}</ref>

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the nervous system begin early during [[embryogenesis]], and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= J Leukoc Biol |year=2006 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |title= The immune response in autism: a new frontier for autism research |author= Ashwood P, Wills S, Van de Water J |doi=10.1189/jlb.1205707 |pmid=16698940 |url=http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1}}</ref> A small percentage of autism cases are associated with infection, usually before birth. Results from immune studies have been contradictory. Some abnormalities have been found in specific subgroups, and some of these have been replicated. It is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to the pathology of autism, for example, by infection or autoimmunity, or whether they are secondary to the disease processes.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Res Autism Spectr Disord |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=840–60 |doi=10.1016/j.rasd.2009.01.007 |author=Stigler KA, Sweeten TL, Posey DJ, McDougle CJ |title=Autism and immune factors: a comprehensive review }}</ref> As [[autoantibodies]] are found in diseases other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD,<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Ann N Y Acad Sci |year=2007 |volume=1107 |pages=79–91 |title= Autoantibodies in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) |author= Wills S, Cabanlit M, Bennett J, Ashwood P, Amaral D, Van de Water J |doi=10.1196/annals.1381.009 |pmid=17804535}}</ref> the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol |year=2008 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=4–11 |title= The neuropathology of autism: where do we stand? |title.= |author= Schmitz C, Rezaie P |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.2007.00872.x |pmid=17971078}}</ref>

In addition, researchers are investigating the theory that certain maternal autoantibodies circulating to the fetus could contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fox E, Amaral D, Van de Water J |title=Maternal and fetal antibrain antibodies in development and disease |journal=Dev Neurobiol |volume=72 |issue=10 |pages=1327–34 |year=2012 |month=October |pmid=22911883 |doi=10.1002/dneu.22052 |url=}}</ref>

===Viral infection===
Many studies have presented evidence for and against association of autism with viral infection after birth. Laboratory rats infected with [[Borna disease virus]] show some symptoms similar to those of autism but blood studies of autistic children show no evidence of infection by this virus. Members of the [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus family]] may have a role in autism, but the evidence so far is anecdotal. Viruses have long been suspected as triggers for immune-mediated diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] but showing a direct role for viral causation is difficult in those diseases, and mechanisms whereby viral infections could lead to autism are speculative.<ref>{{vcite journal|journal=J Neurovirol|year=2005|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–10|title=Autistic disorder and viral infections|author=Libbey JE, Sweeten TL, McMahon WM, Fujinami RS|doi=10.1080/13550280590900553|pmid=15804954}}</ref>

===Excessive hygiene===
The [[hygiene hypothesis]] is to some extent the inverse of the viral infection hypothesis: it states that a lack of early childhood exposure to microbes or parasites contributes to autism. This hypothesis relies on some similarities between autism and [[asthma]] and other autoimmune disorders which are already hypothesized to be affected by hygiene: for example, autism and asthma affect more boys than girls, affect more urban than rural children, and are associated with increased [[Infant|neonatal]] head circumference. This hypothesis has not been tested scientifically.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Med Hypotheses |year=2007 |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=731–40 |title= Autism, asthma, inflammation, and the hygiene hypothesis |author= Becker KG |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.02.019 |pmid=17412520 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17412520 |pmc= 2048743}}</ref>

===Oxidative stress===
This theory hypothesizes that toxicity and [[oxidative stress]] may cause autism in some cases. Evidence includes genetic effects on metabolic pathways, reduced antioxidant capacity, enzyme changes, and enhanced biomarkers for oxidative stress; however, the overall evidence is weaker than it is for involvement oxidative stress with disorders such as [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Int J Neuropsychopharmacol |year=2008 |title= Oxidative stress in psychiatric disorders: evidence base and therapeutic implications |author= Ng F, Berk M, Dean O, Bush AI |doi=10.1017/S1461145707008401 |pmid=18205981 |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=851–76}}</ref> One theory is that stress damages [[Purkinje cell]]s in the [[cerebellum]] after birth, and it is possible that [[glutathione]] is involved.<ref>{{vcite journal|journal=J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev|year=2006 |volume=9|issue=6|pages=485–99|title=Evidence of toxicity, oxidative stress, and neuronal insult in autism|author=Kern JK, Jones AM|doi=10.1080/10937400600882079|pmid=17090484}}</ref>

===Amygdala neurons===
This theory hypothesizes that an early developmental failure involving the [[amygdala]] cascades on the development of cortical areas that mediate social perception in the visual domain. The [[fusiform face area]] of the [[ventral stream]] is implicated. The idea is that it is involved in social knowledge and social cognition, and that the deficits in this network are instrumental in causing autism.<ref>{{vcite journal|journal=Int J Dev Neurosci|year=2005|volume=23|issue=2–3|pages=125–41|title=Developmental deficits in social perception in autism: the role of the amygdala and fusiform face area|author=Schultz RT|doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.12.012|pmid=15749240}}</ref>

===Locus coeruleus–noradrenergic system===
This theory hypothesizes that autistic behaviors depend at least in part on a developmental dysregulation that results in impaired function of the [[locus coeruleus]]–[[noradrenergic]] (LC-NA) system. The LC-NA system is heavily involved in arousal and attention; for example, it is related to the brain's acquisition and use of environmental cues.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Mehler MF, Purpura DP |title= Autism, fever, epigenetics and the locus coeruleus |journal= Brain Res Rev |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=388–92 |year=2009 |pmid=19059284 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.11.001 |laysummary=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1889436,00.html |laysource=TIME |laydate=2009-04-07 |pmc= 2668953}}</ref>

===Lack of vitamin D===
There is some very limited support based on available research for the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency as having a role in leading to autism.  Authors of a review urged more research in this area.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kočovská E, Fernell E, Billstedt E, Minnis H, Gillberg C |title=Vitamin D and autism: clinical review |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1541–50 |year=2012 |pmid=22522213 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2012.02.015 |url=}}</ref>

===Lead===
[[Lead poisoning]] has been suggested as a possible risk factor for autism, as the [[lead]] blood levels of autistic children has been reported to be significantly higher than typical.<ref name="Zafeiriou DI 2006">{{vcite journal |journal= Brain Dev |year=2007 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=257–72 |title= Childhood autism and associated comorbidities |author= Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 |pmid=17084999}}</ref>
The atypical eating  behaviors of autistic children, along with habitual mouthing and [[pica (disorder)|pica]], make it hard to determine whether increased lead levels are a cause or a consequence of autism.<ref name="Zafeiriou DI 2006"/>

===Leaky gut syndrome===
{{Main|Leaky gut syndrome}}

Parents have reported [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) disturbances in autistic children, and several studies have investigated possible associations between autism and the gut.<ref name=Johnson>{{vcite journal |journal= Top Clin Nutr |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=212–25 |year=2006 |author= Johnson TW |title= Dietary considerations in autism: identifying a reasonable approach}}</ref> The now-retracted Wakefield ''et al.'' paper also suggested that some bowel disorders may allow antigens to pass from food into the bloodstream and then to contribute to brain dysfunction.<ref name=Wakefield1998/> Although Wakefield later proposed the term ''[[autistic enterocolitis]]'', his studies' methodology has been criticized, their results have not been replicated by other groups,<ref>{{vcite journal |author= MacDonald TT, Domizio P |title= Autistic enterocolitis; is it a histopathological entity? |title.= |journal=Histopathology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=371–9 |year=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2559.2007.02606.x |pmid=17257133}}</ref> and Wakefield has been accused of manipulating patient data and misreporting results.<ref name=Deer2009/>

There is no research evidence that autistic children are more likely to have GI symptoms than typical children.<ref name=Johnson/> In particular, design flaws in studies of elimination diets mean that the data are inadequate to guide treatment recommendations.<ref name=Christison>{{vcite journal |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |year=2006 |volume=27 |issue= 2 Suppl 2 |pages=S162–71 |title= Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the chaff? |title.= |author= Christison GW, Ivany K |pmid=16685183 |doi= 10.1097/00004703-200604002-00015}}</ref> A 2008 study found that children with autism had no more peptides in their urine than typical children, casting doubt on the proposed mechanism underlying the leaky-gut theory.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Arch Dis Child |year=2008 |title= Absence of urinary opioid peptides in children with autism |author= Cass H, Gringras P, March J ''et al.'' |author.= |doi=10.1136/adc.2006.114389 |pmid=18337276 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7300327.stm |laysource= BBC News |laydate=2008-03-17 |volume=93 |issue=9 |pages=745–50}}</ref>

In another example, a 1998 study of three children with ASD treated with [[secretin]] infusion reported improved GI function and dramatic improvement in behavior, which suggested an association between GI and brain function in autistic children, although the low number of patients is statistically insignificant.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Horvath K, Stefanatos G, Sokolski KN, Wachtel R, Nabors L, Tildon JT|title=Improved social and language skills after secretin administration in patients with autistic spectrum disorders|journal=J Assoc Acad Minor Phys|year=1998|volume=9|issue=1|pages=9–15|pmid=9585670}}</ref> After this study, many parents sought secretin treatment and a black market for the hormone developed quickly.<ref name=Johnson/> However, later studies found secretin ineffective in treating autism.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Sturmey P|title=Secretin is an ineffective treatment for pervasive developmental disabilities: a review of 15 double-blind randomized controlled trials|journal=Res Dev Disabil|year=2005|volume=26|issue=1|pages=87–97|pmid=15590241|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2004.09.002}}</ref>

=== Paracetamol ===
A 2008 preliminary case-control study based on a parent survey presented evidence that [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen, Tylenol) following MMR vaccine is apparently associated with development of [[autism]] in children aged 1–5 years. The effect has not been independently confirmed.<ref name=Schultz>{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |year=2008 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=293–307 |title=Acetaminophen (paracetamol) use, measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, and autistic disorder: the results of a parent survey |author=Schultz ST, Klonoff-Cohen HS, Wingard DL, Akshoomoff NA, Macera CA, Ji M |doi=10.1177/1362361307089518 |pmid=18445737 }}</ref> More evidence for the hypothesis is that in the U.S. paracetamol began to replace [[aspirin]] for infants and young children in the 1980s, about the same time that the number of known autism cases began to rise. However, a similar rise in autism occurred in France, where children continued to receive aspirin.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Good P |title=Did acetaminophen provoke the autism epidemic? |title.= |journal=Altern Med Rev |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=364–72 |year=2009 |pmid=20030462 }}</ref>

===Refrigerator mother===
{{main|Refrigerator mother}}

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to early childhood trauma, and his work was highly influential for decades both in the medical and popular spheres. Parents, especially mothers, of individuals with autism were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection.<ref>{{vcite book |author= Bettelheim B |title= The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self |year=1967 |publisher= Free Press |isbn=0-02-903140-0 |authorlink= Bruno Bettelheim}}</ref> [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism,<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Kanner L |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 |authorlink= Leo Kanner}} Reprinted in {{vcite journal |year=1968 |journal=Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460 |author=<!-- Pacify Citation bot --> }}</ref> suggested that parental coldness might contribute to autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Am J Orthopsychiatry |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=416–26 |year=1949 |author=Kanner L |title= Problems of nosology and psychodynamics in early childhood autism |pmid=18146742 |doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x}}</ref> Although Kanner eventually renounced the theory, Bettelheim put an almost exclusive emphasis on it in both his medical and his popular books. Treatments based on these theories failed to help children with autism, and after Bettelheim's death, it came out that his reported rates of cure (around 85%) were found to be fraudulent.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=12–4 |year=2000 |title= The brutality of Dr. Bettelheim |author=Gardner M |authorlink= Martin Gardner}}</ref>

===Other psychogenic theories===
Psychogenic theories in general have become increasingly unpopular, particularly since twin studies have shown that autism is highly heritable. Nevertheless, some case reports have found that deep institutional privation can result in "quasi-autistic" features without the neuroanatomical differences.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Rutter ML, Kreppner JM, O'Connor TG, English and Romanian Adoptees (ERA) study team |title= Specificity and heterogeneity in children's responses to profound institutional privation |journal= Br J Psychiatry |year=2001 |volume=179 |issue=2 |pages=97–103 |pmid=11483469 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/179/2/97 |doi=10.1192/bjp.179.2.97}}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal |author= Hoksbergen R, ter Laak J, Rijk K, van Dijkum C, Stoutjesdijk F |title= Post-Institutional Autistic Syndrome in Romanian adoptees |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=615–23 |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0005-x |pmid=16167089}}</ref> Other case reports have suggested that children predisposed genetically to autism can develop "autistic devices" in response to traumatic events such as the birth of a sibling.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Gomberoff M, De Gomberoff LP |title= Autistic devices in small children in mourning |journal= Int J Psychoanal |year=2000 |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=907–20 |pmid=11109576 |doi=10.1516/0020757001600282}}</ref>

==Social construct==
Like [[ADHD]], which has a similar social construct theory,<ref>{{vcite journal|journal=Br J Psychiatry|year=2004|volume=184|pages=8–9|title=ADHD is best understood as a cultural construct|author=Timimi S, Taylor E|pmid=14702221|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/184/1/8|doi=10.1192/bjp.184.1.8}}</ref> a spectral disorder such as autism may be understood as a cultural or [[social construct]].<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Timimi S|title=Diagnosis of autism: current epidemic has social context|journal=BMJ|year=2004|volume=328|issue=7433|pages=226|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.226-a|pmid=14739199|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/328/7433/226-a|pmc=318517}}</ref> The theory says that the boundary between normal and abnormal is subjective and arbitrary, so autism does not exist as an objective entity, but only as a social construct. It further argues that autistic individuals themselves have a way of being that is partly socially constructed.<ref>{{vcite book|isbn=0-674-00412-4|author=Hacking I|title=The Social Construction of What?|title.= |publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|pages=114–23}}</ref>

[[Asperger syndrome]] and [[high-functioning autism]] are particular targets of the theory that social factors determine what it means to be autistic. The theory hypothesizes that individuals with these diagnoses inhabit the identities that have been ascribed to them, and promote their sense of well-being by resisting or appropriating autistic ascriptions.<ref>{{vcite book |chapter= The dialectics of autism: theorizing autism, performing autism, remediating autism, and resisting autism |title= Constructing Autism: Unravelling the 'Truth' and Understanding the Social |author= Nadesan MH |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-32181-6 |year=2005 |pages=179–213}}</ref>

== Evolutionary psychology ==
The "[[Empathizing–systemizing theory|extreme male brain theory]]" of autism views autism as an extreme version of male-female differences regarding "systemizing" and [[empathy|empathizing]] abilities. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychological]] explanations for these sex differences include that moderate systemizing would be helpful for male dominated activities such as hunting while empathizing would be similarly helpful in female dominated activities such as caring for children. However, extreme systemizing in combination with low empathizing would lead to autism. One explanation for the increased prevalence of autism may be increased [[assortative mating]] between high systemizers.<ref name=Oxford2007>The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 16 The evolution of empathizing and systemizing: assortative mating of two strong systemizers and the cause of autism, Simon Baron-Cohen.</ref>

The "[[imprinted brain theory]]" is a somewhat similar but not identical theory that considers autism and [[psychosis]] to be contrasting disorders on a number of different variables. This is argued to caused by an unbalanced [[genomic imprinting]] favoring paternal genes in the case of autism and maternal genes in the case of psychosis.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/a0024043}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/4541054a}}</ref>
