'''Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism''' ('''HH'''), also known as '''primary''' or '''peripheral'''/'''gonadal hypogonadism''', is a [[medical condition|condition]] which is characterized by [[hypogonadism]] due to an impaired response of the [[gonad]]s to the [[gonadotropin]]s, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), and in turn a lack of [[sex steroid]] production and elevated gonadotropin levels (as an attempt of compensation by the body). HH may present as either ''congenital'' or ''acquired'', but the majority of cases are of the former nature.<ref name="Mulhall2011">{{cite book | author = John P.

==Causes==
There are a multitude of different etiologies of HH. Congenital causes include the following:<ref name="Mulhall2011" /><ref name="RungePatterson2006">{{cite book | author1 = Marschall Stevens Runge | author2 = Cam Patterson | title = Principles of Molecular Medicine | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=j-_rAKRf3WwC&pg=PA463 | accessdate = 10 June 2012 | date = 20 June 2006 | publisher = Humana Press | isbn = 978-1-58829-202-5 | page = 463}}</ref><ref name="Jameson1998">{{cite book | author = J.

* [[Disorders of steroidogenesis|Defects in the enzymes involved in the gonadal biosynthesis of the sex hormones]] - [[17α-hydroxylase deficiency]], [[17,20-lyase deficiency]], [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency]], and [[lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].
* Gonadotropin resistance (e.g., due to [[genetic mutation|inactivating mutation]]s in the [[gonadotropin receptor]]s) - [[Leydig cell hypoplasia]] (or insensitivity to LH) in males, [[follicle-stimulating hormone insensitivity|FSH insensitivity]] in females, and LH and FSH resistance due to mutations in the ''[[GNAS complex locus|GNAS]]'' [[gene]] (termed [[pseudohypoparathyroidism|pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A]]).

Acquired causes (due to damage to or dysfunction of the [[gonad]]s) include [[gonadal torsion]], [[vanishing testis|vanishing]]/[[anorchia]], [[orchitis]], [[premature ovarian failure]], [[ovarian resistance syndrome]], [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[surgery]], [[autoimmunity]], [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy|radiation]], [[infection]]s (e.g., [[sexually-transmitted disease]]s), [[toxin]]s (e.g., [[endocrine disruptor]]s), and [[drug]]s (e.g., [[antiandrogen]]s, [[opioid]]s, [[ethanol|alcohol]]).<ref name="Mulhall2011" /><ref name="RungePatterson2006" /><ref name="Jameson1998" />

==Symptoms==
{{See also|hypogonadism}}
Examples of symptoms of hypogonadism include [[delayed puberty|delayed, reduced, or absent puberty]], low [[libido]], and [[infertility]].

==Treatment==
Treatment of HH is usually with [[hormone replacement therapy]], consisting of [[androgen]] and [[estrogen]] administration in males and females, respectively.<ref name="RungePatterson2006" />
