'''Digestion''' is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of [[food]] into smaller components that are more easily [[Small_intestine#Absorption|absorbed]] into a [[blood stream]], for instance.  Digestion is a form of [[catabolism]]: a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones.

When food enters the mouth, digestion of the food starts by the action of [[mastication]], a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of [[saliva]]. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the [[salivary glands]], contains [[salivary amylase]], an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]]. It will then travel down the [[esophagus]] and into the [[stomach]] by the action of [[peristalsis]]. [[Gastric juice]] in the stomach starts [[proteolysis|protein digestion]]. Gastric juice mainly contains [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[pepsin]]. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, [[mucus]] is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by [[peristalsis]], which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. After some time (typically an hour or two in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, somewhat shorter duration in house cats){{cn|date=April 2013}}, the resulting thick liquid is called [[chyme]].  When the [[Pylorus|pyloric sphincter valve]] opens, chyme enters the [[duodenum]] where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the [[pancreas]], and then passes through the [[small intestine]], in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine.  Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9.  Some vitamins, such as [[biotin]] and [[vitamin K]] (K<sub>2</sub>MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon.<ref>[http://jamesallred.com/function-of-the-colon Functions of the colon]</ref> Waste material is eliminated from the [[rectum]] during [[defecation]].<ref name=Maton>{{cite book| last = Maton| first = Anthea| authorlink = | coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D.

==Digestive systems==

Digestive systems take many forms. There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion is more primitive, and most [[fungi]] still rely on it.<ref>Dusenbery, David B. (1996). “Life at Small Scale”, pp. 113-115. Scientific American Library, New York. ISBN 0-7167-5060-0.</ref> In this process, [[enzyme]]s are [[Secretion|secreted]] into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] back to the organism. Later, [[animal]]s form a tube in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.<ref>Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', p. 280. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. ISBN 978-0-674-03116-6.</ref>

Some organisms, including nearly all [[spiders]], simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., [[enzyme]]s) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent "soup". In others, once potential nutrients or food is inside the [[organism]], digestion can be conducted to a [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] or a sac-like structure, through a tube, or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient.

===Secretion systems===
{{Main|Secretion}}

[[Bacteria]] use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments.

====Channel transport system====

In a channel transupport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria. It is a simple system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the [[ATP-binding cassette family|ABC protein]], [[membrane fusion protein]] (MFP), and [[outer membrane protein]] (OMP){{Specify|date=May 2011}}. This secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 - 900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small ''Escherichia coli'' peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the ''Pseudomonas fluorescens'' cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa.<ref name= Wooldridge>{{cite book |author= Wooldridge K (editor)| year=2009 |title=Bacterial Secreted Proteins: Secretory Mechanisms and Role in Pathogenesis | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-42-4}}</ref>

====Molecular syringe====

One molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of ''Salmonella'', ''Shigella'', ''Yersinia'') can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in ''Y. pestis'' and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.<ref name=Salyers>Salyers, A. A. & Whitt, D. D. (2002). ''Bacterial Pathogenesis: A Molecular Approach'', 2nd ed., Washington, D.C.: ASM Press. ISBN 1-55581-171-X</ref>

====Conjugation machinery====
The [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] machinery of some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'', which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor).<ref name=Cascales>{{cite journal |author=Cascales E & Christie P.J. |title=The versatile Type IV secretion systems |journal=Nat Rev Microbiol |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=137–149 |year=2003 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro753 |pmid=15035043}}</ref> The VirB complex of ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' is the prototypic system.<ref name=Christie>{{cite journal |author=Christie PJ, Atmakuri K, Jabubowski S, Krishnamoorthy V & Cascales E. |title=Biogenesis, architecture, and function of bacterial Type IV secretion systems |journal=Ann Rev Microbiol |volume=59 |pages=451–485 |year=2005 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123630 |pmid=16153176}}</ref>

The [[Diazotroph|nitrogen fixing]] ''[[Rhizobia]]'' are an interesting case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-[[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] conjugation. Such elements as the ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of [[opines]], which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form [[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|crown gall]] or [[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|root tumors]]. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus [[endosymbiont]]s of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids are themselves conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the ''tra'', or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the ''vir'', or [[virulence]], operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent ''Agrobacteria''.

====Release of outer membrane vesicles====

In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles.<ref name=Chatterjee>Chatterjee, SN and J Das. "Electron microscopic observations on the excretion of cell wall material by ''Vibrio cholerae''." "J.Gen.Microbiol." "49" : 1-11 (1967) ; Kuehn, MJ and NC Kesty.  "Bacterial outer membrane vesicles and the host-pathogen interaction." ''Genes Dev''.and then the  '''19'''(22):2645-55 (2005)</ref>  Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials.  Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells.  While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.<ref name=McBrrom>McBroom, AJ and MJ Kuehn [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17163978 Release of outer membrane vesicles by Gram-negative bacteria is a novel envelope stress response.]  ''Mol. Microbiol.'' '''63'''(2):545-58 (2007)</ref>

[[Image:VFT ne1.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Venus Flytrap (''Dionaea muscipula'') leaf]]

===Gastrovascular cavity===
The [[gastrovascular cavity]] functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body.  Extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity, which is lined with the gastrodermis, the internal layer of [[epithelium]]. This cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut.

In a plant such as the [[Venus Flytrap]] that can make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat.<ref name=Leege>{{cite web | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=how-does-the-venus-flytra | work = Scientific American | author = Leege, Lissa | title = How does the Venus flytrap digest flies? | accessdate= 2008-08-20 }}</ref>

[[Image:Trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes.JPG|thumb|125px|left|[[Trophozoites]] of ''Entamoeba histolytica'' with ingested erythrocytes]]

===Phagosome===
A [[phagosome]] is a [[vacuole]] formed around a particle absorbed by [[phagocytosis]].  The vacuole is formed by the fusion of the [[cell membrane]] around the particle. A phagosome is a [[cellular compartment]] in which [[pathogenic]] microorganisms can be killed and digested. Phagosomes fuse with [[lysosomes]] in their maturation process, forming [[phagolysosome]]s. In humans, ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' can phagocytose [[red blood cell]]s.<ref name=Boettner>{{cite journal |author=Boettner DR, Huston CD, Linford AS, ''et al.'' |title=Entamoeba histolytica phagocytosis of human erythrocytes involves PATMK, a member of the transmembrane kinase family |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=e8 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18208324 |pmc=2211552 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0040008 |url=http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0040008}}</ref>

===Specialised organs and behaviours===
To aid in the digestion of their food animals evolved organs such as beaks, [[tongue]]s, teeth, a crop, gizzard, and others.

====Beaks====
[[Bird]]s have bony [[beak]]s that are specialised according to the bird's [[ecological niche]]. For example, [[macaw]]s primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their impressive beaks to open even the toughest seed. First they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak, then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak.

The mouth of the [[squid]] is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked [[proteins]]. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species.<ref name=Miserez>{{cite journal |last=Miserez|first=A |authorlink= |coauthors=Li, Y; Waite, H; Zok, F |year=2007 |month= |title=Jumbo squid beaks: Inspiration for design of robust organic composites |journal=[[Acta Biomaterialia]] |volume=3 |issue= 1|pages=139–149 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote=|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2006.09.004 |pmid=17113369 }}</ref> The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid.

====Tongue====
{{Main|Tongue}}
The '''tongue''' is skeletal muscle on the floor of the [[mouth]] that manipulates [[food]] for chewing ([[mastication]]) and [[swallowing]] (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by [[saliva]]. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth [[mucous membrane]]. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] before being transported down the [[esophagus]] through [[peristalsis]].

The [[sublingual]] region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the [[oral mucosa]] is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly [[Blood vessel|vascular]] quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

====Teeth====
{{Main|Teeth}}
Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness. The shape of an animal's teeth is related to its diet. For example, plant matter is hard to digest, so herbivores have many molars for chewing.

The teeth of [[carnivore]]s are shaped to kill and tear meat, using specially shaped [[canine tooth|canine teeth]]. Herbivores' teeth are made for grinding food materials, in this case, plant parts.

====Crop====
A [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]], or croup, is a thin-walled expanded portion of the [[alimentary tract]] used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the [[gullet]] or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce [[crop milk]] to feed newly hatched birds.<ref name=Gordon>{{cite web | title=The Alimentary Canal in Birds | url=http://www.earthlife.net/birds/digestion.html | author=Gordon John Larkman Ramel | date=2008-09-29 | accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref>

Certain insects may have a [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] or enlarged [[esophagus]].

[[Image:Abomasum (PSF).png|150px|thumb|Rough illustration of a ruminant digestive system]]

====Abomasum====
{{Main|Abomasum}}

[[Herbivore]]s have evolved [[cecum]]s (or an abomasum in the case of [[ruminant]]s). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the [[rumen]], [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]], [[omasum]], and [[abomasum]]. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material.  Solids clump together to form the cud (or [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]]). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.

Fibre, especially [[cellulose]] and [[hemi-cellulose]], is primarily broken down into the [[volatile fatty acids]], [[acetic acid]], [[propionic acid]] and [[butyric acid]] in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: ([[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], and [[fungi]]). In the omasum water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.

The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine.  Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.

[[File:Flesh fly concentrating food.jpg|thumb|left|A flesh fly "blowing a bubble", possibly to concentrate its food by evaporating water]]

====Specialised behaviours====
[[Regurgitation (digestion)|Regurgitation]] has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of [[Columbidae|pigeons and doves]] with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation.<ref name="Levi">{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}</ref>

Many [[Physical characteristics of sharks|sharks]] have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of unwanted contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins).

Other animals, such as [[rabbits]] and [[rodents]], practise [[coprophagia]] behaviours - eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex  digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.

Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces of their mother, probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components.

===In earthworms===
An [[earthworm]]'s digestive system consists of a [[mouth]], [[pharynx]], [[esophagus]], [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]], [[gizzard]], and [[intestine]]. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By [[peristalsis]], the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.

==Overview of vertebrate digestion==

In most [[vertebrate]]s, digestion is a multi-stage process in the digestive system, starting from ingestion of raw materials, most often other organisms. Ingestion usually involves some type of mechanical and chemical processing. Digestion is separated into four steps:
# [[Ingestion]]: placing food into the mouth (entry of food in the digestive system),
# Mechanical and chemical breakdown:  mastication and the mixing of the resulting [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] with water, [[acid]]s, [[bile]] and [[enzyme]]s in the stomach and intestine to break down complex molecules into simple structures,
# Absorption: of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through [[osmosis]], [[active transport]], and [[diffusion]], and
# Egestion (Excretion): Removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through [[defecation]].

Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and [[peristalsis]]. Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an "overhead charge" on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.).

The major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digesta before excretion.

In [[mammal]]s, preparation for digestion begins with the [[cephalic phase]] in which [[saliva]] is produced in the [[mouth]] and [[digestive enzyme]]s are produced in the [[stomach]].  Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is [[Mastication|chewed]], and mixed with [[saliva]] to begin enzymatic processing of [[starch]]es.  The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes.  [[Small_intestine#Absorption|Absorption]] occurs in the stomach and [[gastrointestinal tract]], and the process finishes with [[defecation]].<ref name=Maton/>

==Human digestion process==
{{Main|Human gastrointestinal tract}}
{{Digestive system diagram}}

The whole digestive system is around 9 meters long. In a healthy human adult this process can take between 24 and 72 hours. [[Food]] digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal.<ref name=KongSingh2008>{{cite journal |author=Kong F, Singh RP |title=Disintegration of solid foods in human stomach |journal=J. Food Sci. |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=R67–80 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18577009 |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00766.x |url=}}[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00766.x/full Free full-text]</ref>

===Phases of gastric secretion===

*[[Cephalic phase]] -  This phase occurs before food enters the stomach and involves preparation of the body for eating and digestion. Sight and thought stimulate the [[cerebral cortex]]. Taste and smell stimulus is sent to the [[hypothalamus]] and [[medulla oblongata]]. After this it is routed through the [[vagus nerve]] and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and [[G cell]] (secretes gastrin) activity via [[D cell (biology)|D cell]] secretion of [[somatostatin]].
*Gastric phase - This phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by [[Gastric distension|distension]] of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in [[pH]]. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of [[acetylcholine]], which stimulates the release of more [[gastric juice]]s. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to [[hydrogen]] ions, which raises the [[pH]] of the [[stomach]]. Inhibition of gastrin and [[gastric acid]] secretion is lifted. This triggers [[G cell]]s to release [[gastrin]], which in turn stimulates [[parietal cell]]s to secrete gastric acid.  Gastric acid is about 0.5% [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3.  Acid release is also triggered by [[acetylcholine]] and [[histamine]].
*Intestinal phase - This phase has 2 parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the [[duodenum]]. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic fibers]] causing the [[Pylorus|pyloric sphincter]] to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.

===Oral cavity===
{{Main|Mouth (human)}}

In '''humans''', digestion begins in the Mouth, otherwise known as the "Buccal Cavity", where food is [[Mastication|chewed]]. [[Saliva]] is secreted in large amounts (1-1.5 litres/day) by three pairs of exocrine salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual) in the oral cavity, and is mixed with the chewed food by the tongue. Saliva cleans the oral cavity, moistens the food, and contains digestive [[enzyme]]s such as salivary [[amylase]], which aids in the [[Hydrolysis|chemical breakdown]] of [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[starch]] into [[disaccharide]]s such as [[maltose]].  It also contains mucus, a [[glycoprotein]] that helps soften the food and form it into a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]]. An additional enzyme, [[lingual lipase]], hydrolyzes long-chain triglycerides into partial glycerides and free fatty acids.

[[Swallowing]] transports the chewed food into the [[esophagus]], passing through the [[oropharynx]] and [[hypopharynx]]. The mechanism for swallowing is coordinated by the swallowing center in the [[medulla oblongata]] and [[pons]]. The reflex is initiated by touch receptors in the pharynx as the bolus of food is pushed to the back of the mouth.

===Pharynx===
{{Main|Human pharynx}}

The pharynx is the part of the neck and throat situated immediately behind the mouth and nasal cavity, and cranial, or superior, to the esophagus. It is part of the [[digestive system]] and [[respiratory system]]. Because both food and air pass through the pharynx, a flap of connective tissue, the [[epiglottis]] closes over the trachea when food is swallowed to prevent choking or asphyxiation.

The [[oropharynx]] is that part of the pharynx behind the oral cavity. It is lined with [[stratified squamous epithelium]]. The [[nasopharynx]] lies behind the nasal cavity and like the nasal passages is lined with ciliated columnar [[pseudostratified epithelium]].

Like the oropharynx above it the hypopharynx ([[laryngopharynx]]) serves as a passageway for food and air and is lined with a stratified squamous epithelium. It lies inferior to the upright epiglottis and extends to the larynx, where the respiratory and digestive pathways diverge. At that point, the laryngopharynx is continuous with the esophagus. During swallowing, food has the "right of way", and air passage temporarily stops.

===Esophagus===<!-- Please do not change the spelling of esophagus to oesophagus - see WP:ENGVAR for why; regional spellings should not be switched back and forth -->
{{Main|Esophagus}}

The esophagus is a narrow muscular tube about 20-30 centimeters long, which starts at the [[pharynx]] at the back of the mouth, passes through the [[thoracic diaphragm]], and ends at the [[Cardiac|cardiac orifice]] of the [[stomach]].  The wall of the esophagus is made up of two layers of [[smooth muscle]]s, which form a continuous layer from the esophagus to the colon and contract slowly, over long periods of time. The inner layer of muscles is arranged circularly in a series of descending rings, while the outer layer is arranged longitudinally.  At the top of the esophagus, is a flap of tissue called the [[epiglottis]] that closes during swallowing to prevent food from entering the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (windpipe).  The chewed food is pushed down the esophagus to the stomach through [[Peristalsis|peristaltic]] contraction of these muscles.  It takes only about seven seconds for food to pass through the esophagus and now digestion takes place.

===Stomach===
{{Main|Stomach}}

The stomach is a small, 'J'-shaped pouch with walls made of thick, distensible [[muscle]]s, which stores and helps break down food. Food reduced to very small particles is more likely to be fully digested in the small intestine, and stomach churning has the effect of assisting the physical disassembly begun in the mouth. Ruminants, who are able to digest fibrous material (primarily [[cellulose]]), use fore-stomachs and repeated chewing to further the disassembly. Rabbits and some other animals pass [[Cecotrope|some material]] through their entire digestive systems twice. Most birds ingest small stones to assist in mechanical processing in gizzards.

Food enters the stomach through the cardiac orifice where it is further broken apart and thoroughly mixed with [[gastric acid]], [[pepsin]] and other [[digestive enzyme]]s to break down proteins. The enzymes in the stomach also have an optimum conditions, meaning that they work at a specific pH and temperature better than any others. The acid itself does not break down food molecules, rather it provides an optimum pH for the reaction of the enzyme [[pepsin]] and kills many microorganisms that are ingested with the food. It can also denature proteins. This is the process of reducing polypeptide bonds and disrupting salt bridges, which in turn causes a loss of secondary, tertiary, or quaternary protein structure.  The [[parietal cell]]s of the stomach also secrete a [[glycoprotein]] called [[intrinsic factor]], which enables the absorption of [[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B-12]].  Mucus neck cells are present in the gastric glands of the stomach. They secrete [[mucus]], which along with [[gastric juice]] plays an important role in lubrication and protection of the mucosal epithelium from excoriation by the highly concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]. Other small molecules such as [[alcohol]] are [[Absorption (digestive)|absorbed]] in the stomach, passing through the membrane of the stomach and entering the [[circulatory system]] directly. Food in the stomach is in semi-liquid form, which upon completion is known as [[chyme]].

After consumption of food, digestive "tonic" and [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] contractions begin, which helps break down the food and move it onward.<ref name=KongSingh2008/> When the chyme reaches the opening to the [[duodenum]] known as the [[pylorus]], contractions "squirt" the food back into the stomach through a process called retropulsion, which exerts additional force and further grinds down food into smaller particles.<ref name=KongSingh2008/> Gastric emptying is the release of food from the stomach into the duodenum; the process is tightly controlled with liquids being emptied much more quickly than solids.<ref name=KongSingh2008/> Gastric emptying has attracted medical interest as [[gastric dumping syndrome|rapid gastric emptying]] is related to obesity and [[Gastroparesis|delayed gastric emptying syndrome]] is associated with diabetes mellitus, aging, and gastroesophageal reflux.<ref name=KongSingh2008/>

The transverse section of the alimentary canal reveals four (or five, see description under mucosa) distinct and well developed layers within the stomach:
* [[Serous membrane]], a thin layer of [[Mesothelium|mesothelial cell]]s that is the outermost wall of the stomach.
* [[Muscular coat]], a well-developed layer of muscles used to mix ingested food, composed of three sets running in three different alignments.  The outermost layer runs parallel to the vertical axis of the stomach (from top to bottom), the middle is concentric to the axis (horizontally circling the stomach cavity) and the innermost oblique layer, which is responsible for mixing and breaking down ingested food, runs diagonal to the longitudinal axis.  The inner layer is unique to the stomach, all other parts of the digestive tract have only the first two layers.
* [[Submucosa]], composed of [[connective tissue]] that links the inner muscular layer to the mucosa and contains the [[nerve]]s, blood and [[lymph vessel]]s.
* [[Mucosa]] is the extensively folded innermost layer. It can be divided into the [[epithelium]], [[lamina propria]], and the [[muscularis mucosae]], though some consider the outermost ''muscularis mucosae'' to be a distinct layer, as it develops from the mesoderm rather than the endoderm (thus making a total of five layers). The epithelium and lamina are filled with [[connective tissue]] and covered in [[gastric gland]]s that may be simple or branched tubular, and secrete [[mucus]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[pepsin]]ogen and [[rennin]]. The mucus lubricates the food and also prevents hydrochloric acid from acting on the walls of the stomach.

===Small intestine===
{{Main|Small intestine}}
It has three parts: the [[Duodenum]], [[Jejunum]], and [[Ileum]].

After being processed in the stomach, food is passed to the [[small intestine]] via the [[Pylorus|pyloric sphincter]]. The majority of digestion and absorption occurs here after the milky [[chyme]] enters the [[duodenum]].  Here it is further mixed with three different liquids:
* [[Bile]], which [[Emulsion|emulsifies]] [[fat]]s to allow absorption, [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralizes]] the chyme and is used to excrete waste products such as [[bilin (biochemistry)|bilin]] and [[bile acid]]s. Bile is produced by the [[liver]] and then stored in the [[gallbladder]] where it will be released to the small intestine via the [[bile duct]]. The bile in the gallbladder is much more concentrated.{{clarify|date=August 2012|reason=This has been here since the February 2010 edit at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Digestion&oldid=341430985, bit "much more concentrated" than what???}}
* [[Pancreatic juice]] made by the [[pancreas]], which secretes enzymes such as [[amylase|pancreatic amylase]], [[lipase|pancreatic lipase]], and [[trypsinogen]] (inactive form of [[protease]]).
* [[Intestinal juice]] secreted by the [[intestinal glands]] in the [[small intestine]]. It contains enzymes such as [[enteropeptidase]], [[erepsin]], [[trypsin]], [[chymotrypsin]], [[maltase]], [[lactase]] and [[sucrase]] (all three of which process only [[sugar]]s).

The pH level increases in the small intestine as all three fluids are [[alkaline]]. A more basic environment causes more helpful enzymes to activate and begin to help in the breakdown of molecules such as [[Globules of fat|fat globules]]. Small, finger-like structures called [[intestinal villus|villi]], and their [[epithelial cells]] is covered with numerous [[Microvillus|microvilli]] to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the [[surface area]] of the intestine and enhancing speed at which nutrients are absorbed. [[Blood]] containing the absorbed nutrients is carried away from the small intestine via the [[hepatic portal vein]] and goes to the [[liver]] for filtering, removal of toxins, and nutrient processing.

The small intestine and remainder of the digestive tract undergoes [[peristalsis]] to transport food from the stomach to the [[rectum]] and allow food to be mixed with the digestive juices and absorbed. The circular muscles and longitudinal muscles are [[Antagonist (muscle)|antagonistic muscles]], with one contracting as the other relaxes.  When the circular muscles contract, the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] becomes narrower and longer and the food is squeezed and pushed forward. When the longitudinal muscles contract, the circular muscles relax and the gut dilates to become wider and shorter to allow food to enter.

===Large intestine===
{{Main|Large intestine}}

After the food has been passed through the small intestine, the food enters the [[large intestine]]. Within it, digestion is retained long enough to allow fermentation due to the action of gut bacteria, which breaks down some of the substances that remain after processing in the small intestine; some of the breakdown products are absorbed. In humans, these include most complex saccharides (at most three disaccharides are digestible in humans). In addition, in many vertebrates, the large intestine reabsorbs fluid; in a few, with desert lifestyles, this reabsorbtion makes continued existence possible.

In general, the large intestine is less vigorous in absorptive activity. It produces sacculation, renews epithelial cells, and provides protective mucus and mucosal immunity. In humans, the large intestine is roughly 1.5 meters long, with three parts: the [[cecum]] at the junction with the [[small intestine]], the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], and the [[rectum]]. The colon itself has four parts:  the [[ascending colon]], the [[transverse colon]], the [[descending colon]], and the [[sigmoid colon]]. The large intestine absorbs water from the [[chyme]] and stores [[feces]] until it can be [[Defecation|egested]].  Food products that cannot go through the [[Intestinal villus|villi]], such as [[cellulose]] ([[dietary fiber]]), are mixed with other waste products from the body and become hard and concentrated [[feces]]. The feces is stored in the [[rectum]] for a certain period and then the stored feces is eliminated from the body due to the contraction and relaxation through the [[anus]]. The exit of this waste material is regulated by the [[anal sphincter]].

==Breakdown into nutrients==
{{Expand section|digestion of other substances|date=August 2011}}

===Protein digestion===
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and [[duodenum]] in which 3 main enzymes, [[pepsin]] secreted by the stomach and [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]] secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into [[polypeptides]] that are then broken down by various [[exopeptidases]] and [[dipeptidases]] into [[amino acids]].  The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the [[zymogens]].  For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of [[trypsinogen]], which is activated in the duodenum by [[enterokinase]] to form trypsin.  Trypsin then cleaves [[protein]]s to smaller [[polypeptide]]s.

===Fat digestion=== <!--Fat digestion redirects here-->
Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where [[lingual lipase]] breaks down some short chain lipids into [[diglyceride]]s.  The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of [[pancreatic lipase]] from the pancreas and [[Bile acid|bile]] from the liver for breakdown of fats into [[fatty acids]].  Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a [[triglyceride]]) results in 3 fatty acid molecules and one [[glycerol]] molecule.

===Carbohydrate digestion===
In humans, dietary starches are composed of [[glucose]] units arranged in long chains called amylose, a [[polysaccharide]]. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic [[amylase]], resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose.  This results in simple sugars glucose and [[maltose]] (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.

[[Lactase]] is an enzyme that breaks down the [[disaccharide]] [[lactose]] to its component parts, glucose and [[galactose]].  Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine.  Approximately half of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat milk-based foods. This is commonly known as lactose intolerance.

[[Sucrase]] is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide [[sucrose]], commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. Sucrose digestion yields the sugars [[fructose]] and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine.

===DNA and RNA digestion===
DNA and RNA are broken down into [[Nucleotide|mononucleotides]] by the [[nuclease]]s [[deoxyribonuclease]] and [[ribonuclease]] (DNase and RNase) from the pancreas.

==Digestive hormones==
[[image:Digestive hormones.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Action of the major digestive hormones]]
There are at least five hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals. There are variations across the vertebrates, as for instance in birds. Arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered. For instance, more connections to metabolic control (largely the glucose-insulin system) have been uncovered in recent years.

* [[Gastrin]] - is in the [[stomach]] and stimulates the [[gastric gland]]s to secrete [[pepsinogen]] (an inactive form of the enzyme [[pepsin]]) and [[hydrochloric acid]]. Secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low [[pH]] .
* [[Secretin]] - is in the [[duodenum]] and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the [[pancreas]] and it stimulates the [[bile]] secretion in the [[liver]].  This hormone responds to the acidity of the chyme.
* [[Cholecystokinin]] (CCK) - is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the [[gall bladder]]. This hormone is secreted in response to fat in chyme.
* [[Gastric inhibitory peptide]] (GIP) - is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach. Another function is to induce [[Insulin#Release|insulin secretion.]]
* [[Motilin]] - is in the duodenum and increases the [[migrating myoelectric complex]] component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of [[pepsin]].

==Significance of pH in digestion==

Digestion is a complex process controlled by several factors. [[pH]] plays a crucial role in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. [[Saliva]] controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. [[Salivary amylase]] is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into [[monosaccharides]]. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a high or low pH environment.

The stomach's high acidity inhibits the breakdown of [[carbohydrates]] within it. This acidity confers two benefits: it [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatures]] proteins for further digestion in the small intestines, and provides [[Innate immune system|non-specific immunity]], damaging or eliminating various [[pathogens]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the small intestines, the duodenum provides critical pH balancing to activate digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the duodenum to neutralize the acidic conditions from the stomach, and the [[pancreatic duct]] empties into the duodenum, adding [[bicarbonate]] to neutralize the acidic [[chyme]], thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the small intestines is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Uses of animal's  internal organs by humans==
* The stomachs of calves have commonly been used as a source of [[rennet]] for making [[cheese]].
* The use of animal gut [[Strings (music)|strings]] by musicians can be traced back to the [[third dynasty of Egypt]].  In the recent past, strings were made out of [[domestic sheep|lamb]] gut.  With the advent of the modern era, musicians have tended to use strings made of [[silk]], or synthetic materials such as [[nylon]] or [[steel]].  Some instrumentalists, however, still use gut strings in order to evoke the older tone quality.  Although such strings were commonly referred to as "[[catgut]]" strings, [[cat]]s were never used as a source for gut strings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
* Sheep gut was the original source for natural gut string used in [[racquet]]s, such as for [[tennis]].  Today, synthetic strings are much more common, but the best gut strings are now made out of [[cow]] gut.
* Gut cord has also been used to produce strings for the snares that provide a [[snare drum]]'s characteristic buzzing timbre.  While the modern snare drum almost always uses metal wire rather than gut cord, the [[North Africa]]n [[bendir]] frame drum still uses gut for this purpose.
* "Natural" sausage hulls (or [[Casing (sausage)|casings]]) are made of animal gut, especially hog, beef, and lamb.  Similarly, [[Haggis]] is traditionally boiled in, and served in, a sheep stomach.
* [[Chitterlings]], a kind of food, consist of thoroughly washed [[pig]]'s gut.
* Animal gut was used to make the cord lines in [[longcase clock]]s and for [[fusee (horology)|fusee]] movements in [[bracket clock]]s, but may be replaced by metal wire.
* The oldest known [[condom]]s, from 1640 AD, were made from animal intestine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_1870958.html?menu=news.quirkies.sexlife | title = World's oldest condom | accessdate = 2008-04-11 | year = 2008| publisher = [[Ananova]] }}</ref>
