'''Epidural''' or '''extradural hematoma (haematoma)''' is a type of [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) in which a buildup of blood occurs between the [[dura mater]] (the tough outer membrane of the [[central nervous system]]) and the [[Human skull|skull]]. The dura mater also covers the spine, so epidural bleeds may also occur in the spinal column. Often due to [[physical trauma|trauma]], the condition is potentially deadly because the buildup of blood may increase [[intracranial pressure|pressure]] in the [[intracranial space]], compress delicate brain tissue, and cause [[brain herniation|brain shift]]. The condition is present in one to three percent of [[head injury|head injuries]].<ref name="Mishra">{{cite journal|author=Mishra A, Mohanty S|title=Contre-coup extradural haematoma: A short report|journal=Neurology India|volume=49|issue=94|url=http://www.neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2001;volume=49;issue=1;spage=94;epage=5;aulast=Mishra|accessdate=2008-01-24|pmid=11303253|pages=94|year=2001}}</ref> Between 15 and 20% of epidural hematomas are fatal.<ref>Sanders MJ and McKenna K. 2001.

==Signs and symptoms==
Epidural bleeds, like [[subdural hematoma|subdural]] and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]s, are [[extra-axial hemorrhage|extra-axial bleeds]], occurring outside of the brain tissue, while [[intra-axial hemorrhage]]s, including [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage|intraparenchymal]] and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]]s, occur within it.

Epidural hematomas may present with a lucid period immediately following the trauma and a delay before symptoms become evident. After the epidural hematoma begins collecting, it starts to compress intracranial structures which may impinge on the CN III.<ref name=medscape/> This can be seen in the physical exam as a fixed and dilated pupil on the side of the injury.<ref name=medscape>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/824029-overview#a0104 Epidural Hematoma in Emergency Medicine] at Medscape. Author:  Daniel D Price. Updated: Nov 3, 2010</ref> The eye will be positioned down and out, due to unopposed CN IV and CN VI innervation.

Other manifestations will include weakness of the extremities on the opposite side as the lesion (except in rare cases), due to compression of the [[Pyramidal tracts|crossed pyramid pathways]], and a loss of visual field opposite to the side of the lesion, due to compression of the [[posterior cerebral artery]] on the side of the lesion.

The most feared event that takes place is the transtentorial, or uncal herniation which results in respiratory arrest since the medullary structures are compromised. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) may be involved late in the process as the pons becomes compressed, but this is not a significant clinical presentation, since by that time the patient may already be dead.<ref>Wagner AL. 2006. [http://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic664.htm "Subdural Hematoma."] Emedicine.com. Retrieved on February 6, 2007.</ref> In the case of epidural hematoma in the [[posterior cranial fossa]], the herniation is [[Brain herniation#Tonsillar herniation|tonsillar]] and causes the [[Cushing's triad]]: hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respiration.

Epidural bleeding is rapid because it is usually from arteries, which are high pressure. Epidural bleeds from arteries can grow until they reach their peak size at six to eight hours post injury, spilling from 25 to 75 cubic centimeters of blood into the [[intracranial space]].<ref name="uv"/> As the hematoma expands, it strips the dura from the inside of the skull, causing an intense headache. Epidural bleeds can become large and raise [[intracranial pressure]], causing the brain to shift, lose blood supply, or be crushed against the skull. Larger hematomas cause more damage. Epidural bleeds can quickly expand and compress the brain stem, causing [[coma|unconsciousness]], [[abnormal posturing]], and abnormal [[pupil]] responses to light.<ref name="singh Stock">Singh J and Stock A. 2006.

==Diagnosis==
{{Epidural vs. subdural hematoma}}
On images produced by [[CT scan]]s and [[MRI]]s, epidural hematomas usually appear convex in shape because their expansion stops at the skull's [[skull suture|sutures]], where the dura mater is tightly attached to the skull. Thus they expand inward toward the brain rather than along the inside of the skull, as occurs in [[subdural hematoma]]. The lens-like shape of the hematoma causes the appearance of these bleeds to be "lentiform."

Epidural hematomas may occur in combination with subdural hematomas, or either may occur alone.<ref name="Shepherd"/> CT scans reveal subdural or epidural hematomas in 20% of unconscious patients.<ref name="Downie">Downie A. 2001. [http://www.radiology.co.uk/srs-x/tutors/cttrauma/tutor.htm "Tutorial: CT in Head Trauma"]. Retrieved on February 6, 2007.</ref> In the hallmark of epidural hematoma, patients may regain consciousness and appear completely normal during what is called a [[lucid interval]], only to descend suddenly and rapidly into unconsciousness later. The lucid interval, which depends on the extent of the injury, is a key to diagnosing epidural hemorrhage. If the patient is not treated with prompt surgical intervention, death is likely to follow.<ref name="Caroline">Caroline NL. 1991. ''Emergency Medical Treatment''. Little Brown & Company.</ref>

==Causes==
[[Image:Skull interior anatomy.svg|thumb|The interior of the skull has sharp ridges by which a moving brain can be injured]]

The most common cause of intracranial epidural hematoma is [[Traumatic brain injury|traumatic]], although spontaneous hemorrhage is known to occur. Hemorrhages commonly result from acceleration-deceleration trauma and transverse forces.<ref name="uv">University of Vermont College of Medicine.

Epidural hematoma commonly results from a blow to the side of the head. The [[pterion]] region which overlies the middle meningeal artery is relatively weak and prone to injury.<ref name="Shepherd">Shepherd S. 2004. [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2820.htm "Head Trauma."] Emedicine.com.

Epidural hematoma is usually found on the same side of the brain that was impacted by the blow, but on very rare occasions it can be due to a [[contrecoup injury]].<ref name="Mishra"/>

==Treatment==
As with other types of [[intracranial hematoma]]s, the blood may be removed surgically to remove the mass and reduce the pressure it puts on the brain.<ref name="McCaffrey"/> The hematoma is evacuated through a [[burr hole]] or [[craniotomy]]. If transfer to a facility with neurosurgery is prolonged [[trephination]] may be performed in the emergency department.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith SW, Clark M, Nelson J, Heegaard W, Lufkin KC, Ruiz E|title=Emergency department skull trephination for epidural hematoma in patients who are awake but deteriorate rapidly|journal=J Emerg Med|volume=39|issue=3|pages=377–83|year=2010|pmid=19535215 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.04.062}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
In TBI patients with epidural hematomas, prognosis is better if there was a lucid interval (a period of consciousness before coma returns) than if the patient was comatose from the time of injury.<ref name="Zink01"/> Unlike most forms of TBI, people with epidural hematoma and a [[Glasgow Coma Score]] of 3 (the lowest score) are expected to make a good outcome if they can receive surgery quickly.<ref name="Zink01">{{cite journal|author=Zink BJ|title=Traumatic brain injury outcome: Concepts for emergency care|journal=Ann Emerg Med|volume=37|issue=3|pages=318–32|year=2001|pmid=11223769|doi=10.1067/mem.2001.113505 }}</ref>

==Of the spine==
Bleeding into the epidural space in the spine may also cause epidural hematoma. These may arise spontaneously (e.g. during [[childbirth]]), or as a rare complication of anaesthesia (such as [[epidural]] anaesthesia) or surgery (such as [[laminectomy]]).

The anatomy of the epidural space means that spinal epidural hematoma has a different profile from cranial epidural hematoma. In the spine, the epidural space contains loose fatty tissue, and the '''epidural venous plexus''', a network of large, thin-walled veins. This means that bleeding is likely to be venous. Anatomical abnormalities and [[coagulopathy|bleeding disorders]] make these lesions more likely. They may cause pressure on the spinal cord or [[cauda equina]], which may present as pain, muscle weakness, or bladder and bowel dysfunction. The diagnosis may be made on clinical appearance and time course of symptoms. It usually requires [[MRI]] scanning to confirm. The treatment is surgical decompression.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The incidence of epidural hematoma following epidural anaesthesia is extremely difficult to quantify; estimates vary from 1 per 10,000 to 1 per 100,000 epidural anaesthetics.

==Notable cases==
[[Michel de Montaigne]], in his essay "That to Philosophise is to Learn to Die," written in the 1580s, gives the case of his brother, Captain Saint-Martin, aged 23 years. He was playing real, or court, tennis "when he was struck by a ball a little above the right ear. There being no sign of a wound or contusion, he did not sit down to rest, but five or six hours later he died of an [[apoplexy]] caused by this blow." [from the translation by E. J. Trechmann]

On February 20, 1998, 38 year-old Indian cricketer [[Raman Lamba]] was hit on the head by a cricket ball while fielding without a helmet. Although Lamba walked off the field and the injury did not appear to be serious at the time, he slipped into a coma on the day of the injury and then succumbed to internal hemorrhage three days later.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/cricket/59461.stm | title =Cricketer killed by ball|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=February 23, 1998|accessdate=January 3, 2010}}</ref>

On April 17, 2003, at age 72, [[Robert Atkins (nutritionist)|Dr. Robert Atkins]], creator of the [[Atkins diet]], slipped on the ice while walking to work, hitting his head and causing bleeding around his brain. He lost consciousness on the way to the hospital, where he spent two weeks in intensive care. His death certificate states that the cause of death was "blunt impact injury of head with epidural hematoma".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/atkinsmed1.html|title=Copy of Robert Atkins' Death Certificate|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=2008-10-14}}</ref>

On May 26, 2010, actor [[Gary Coleman]] was admitted to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, Utah, after falling and hitting his head and suffering an epidural hematoma at his home in Santaquin, Utah. He was announced to be in critical condition. By mid-afternoon on May 27, 2010, Coleman was unconscious and on life support. He died at 12:05 p.m. MDT (18:05 UTC) on May 28, 2010.

On September 5, 2012, Major League Baseball Pitcher [[Brandon McCarthy]] was hit by a line drive to the head from [[Erick Aybar]]. He was immediately rushed to the hospital where he underwent a 2-hour surgery to relieve pressure on his brain. Although he never lost consciousness and walked off the field, McCarthy suffered an epidural hemorrhage, brain contusion and skull fracture in the accident.
