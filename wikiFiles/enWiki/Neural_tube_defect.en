'''Neural tube defects''' (NTDs) are one of the most common [[birth defects]], occurring in approximately one in 1,000<ref>{{cite web |author=National Institute of Child Health and Human Development |title=How many people are affected by or are at risk for neural tube defects? |date=30 November 2012 |work=[http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/ntds/Pages/default.aspx Neural Tube Defects (NTDs)] |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/ntds/conditioninfo/pages/risk.aspx}}</ref> live births in the United States. A NTD is an opening in the [[spinal cord]] or [[brain]] that occurs very early in human development. In the 3rd week of pregnancy called [[gastrulation]], specialized cells on the dorsal side of the fetus begin to fuse and form the neural tube. When the [[neural tube]] does not close completely, an NTD develops.

==Types of NTDs==
There are two types of NTDs: open, which are more common, and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or vertebrae (back bones). Examples of open NTDs are [[anencephaly]], [[encephalocele]]s, [[hydranencephaly]], [[iniencephaly]], [[schizencephaly]], and [[spina bifida]]. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. Common examples of closed NTDs are [[lipomyelomeningocele]], [[lipomeningocele]], and [[tethered cord]].

=== Anencephaly ===
[[Anencephaly]] (without brain) is a neural tube defect that occurs when the head end of the neural tube fails to close, usually during the 23rd and 26th days of pregnancy, resulting in an absence of a major portion of the brain and skull.  Infants born with this condition are born without the main part of the forebrain-the largest part of the cerebrum.  Infants born with this condition are usually blind, deaf and unconscious.  The lack of a functioning cerebrum will ensure that the infant will never gain consciousness.  Infants are either stillborn or usually die within a few hours or days after birth.

===Encephaloceles===
Encephaloceles are characterized by protrusions of the brain through the skull that are sac-like and covered with membrane.  They can be a groove down the middle of the upper part of the skull, between the forehead and nose, or the back of the skull.  Encephaloceles are often obvious and diagnosed immediately.  Sometimes small encephaloceles in the nasal and forehead are undetected.

===Hydranencephaly===
[[Hydranencephaly]] is a condition in which the [[cerebral hemispheres]] are missing and instead filled with sacs of cerebrospinal fluid.

===Iniencephaly===
[[Iniencephaly]] is a rare neural tube defect that results in extreme bending of the head to the spine.  The diagnosis can usually be made on antenatal ultrasound scanning but if not will undoubtedly be made immediately after birth because the head is bent backwards and the face looks upwards.  Usually the neck is absent.  The skin of the face connects directly to the chest and the scalp connect to the upper back.  The infant usually will not survive more than a few hours.

===Spina bifida===
[[Spina bifida]] is further divided into two subclasses, spina bifida cystica and spina bifida occulta.

==== Spina bifida cystica ====
This includes [[meningocele]] and [[myelomeningocele]].  Meningocele is less severe and is characterized by herniation of the meninges, but not the spinal cord, through the opening in the spinal canal.  Myeolomeningocele involves herniation of the meninges as well as the spinal cord through the opening.<ref name="firstaid">

The genetic risk of recurrence with symptomatic forms of Spina Bifida Occulta is uncertain.

==Folic acid pathway==
[[Folic acid]] (vitamin B<sub>9</sub>) and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] are very important in reducing the occurrences of NTDs.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-1173 | last1 = Molloy | first1 = A.

Folate is needed to carry one carbon groups for methylation and nucleic acid synthesis. It has been [http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper.php?doi=052102nb hypothesized] that the early human embryo may be particularly vulnerable to folate deficiency due to differences of the functional enzymes in this pathway during embryogenesis combined with high demand for post translational methylations of the cytoskeleton in neural cells during neural tube closure. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is also an important receptor in the folate biopathway  such that studies have shown deficiency in vitamin B<sub>12</sub> contributes to risk of NTDs as well.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ymgme.2009.06.004 | last1 = Li | first1 = F. | last2 = Watkins | first2 = D. | last3 = Rosenblatt | first3 = D.

The association seen between reduced neural tube defects and folic acid supplementation is due to exposing folate-dependent NTDs, such as in the ''Splotch'' gene mutation. Therefore giving folic acid supplementation during pregnancy reduces the prevalence of NTDs by not exposing these otherwise sub-clinical mutation. Note that not all mutations are folate-dependent though.

==Other Causes==
Other potential causes can include folate antimetabolites (such as [[methotrexate]]), maternal diabetes, maternal obesity, [[mycotoxins]] in contaminated corn meal, [[arsenic]], [[hyperthermia]] in early development, and radiation.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1177162|Neural Tube Defects}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Suarez | first1 = L. | last2 = Brender | first2 = J.

A mechanism by which maternal exposure to cigarette smoke could increase NTD risk in offspring is suggested by several studies which show an association between cigarette smoking and homocysteine levels.  The study suggests that cigarette smoke including secondhand exposure is not only hazardous to the mother but may also interfere with neural tube closure in the developing embryo.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10995-007-0251-y | last1 = Suarez | first1 = L. | last2 = Felkner | first2 = M. | last3 = Brender | first3 = J.

==Detection==
Tests for neural tube defects include [[Triple test|ultrasound examination]] and measurement of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein ([[Alpha-fetoprotein|MSAFP]]).  Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFAFP) and amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase (AFAChE) tests are also used to confirming if ultrasound screening indicates a positive risk.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.252.11.1438 | last1 = Milunsky | first1 = A | last2 = Alpert | first2 = E. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1984 | title = Results and benefits of a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening program | journal = JAMA | volume = 252 | issue = 11| pages = 1438–42 | pmid = 6206249 }}</ref>  Often, these defects are apparent at birth, but occult defects may not be diagnosed until much later in life.  An elevated MSAFP measured at 16–18 weeks gestation is a good predictor of neural tube defects.

==Prevention==
In 1996, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads, cereals, flour and other grain products.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = S | last2 = Mills | first2 = JL | last3 = Molloy | first3 = AM | last4 = Conley | first4 = M | last5 = Lee | first5 = YJ | last6 = Kirke | first6 = PN | last7 = Weir | first7 = DG | last8 = Scott | first8 = JM | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1997 | title = Minimum effective dose of folic acid for food fortification to prevent neural-tube defects | url = | journal = Lancet | pmid = 9400511 | volume = 350 | issue = 9092| pages = 1666–9 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)07247-4 }}</ref> It is important to note that during the first four weeks of pregnancy (when most women do not even realize that they are pregnant), adequate folate intake is essential for proper operation of the [[neurulation]] process.  Therefore, women who could become pregnant are advised to eat foods fortified with folic acid or take supplements in addition to eating folate-rich foods to reduce the risks of serious birth defects.<ref name="Greene, N.

Women who could become pregnant are advised to get 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Women who are pregnant should receive 1.0&nbsp;mg daily, and women who have previously given birth to a child with a neural tube defect should get 4.0&nbsp;mg/5.0&nbsp;mg in the UK&nbsp;mg daily.<ref name="FDA_Folic_Rec">{{cite journal |author=Centers for Disease Control |title=Recommendations for the Use of Folic Acid to Reduce the Number of Cases of Spina Bifida and Other Neural Tube Defects |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=41 |issue=RR-14 |pages=001 |date=11 September 1992 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019479.htm}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatments of NTDs depends on the severity of the complication.  No treatment is available for anencephaly because the infants usually do not survive more than a few hours.  Aggressive surgical management has improved survival and functions of infants with spina bifida and meningoceles and mild myelomeningoceles.  The success of surgery often depends on the amount of brain tissue involved in the encephalocele.  The goal of treatment for NTDs is to allow the individual to achieve the highest level of function and independence.
