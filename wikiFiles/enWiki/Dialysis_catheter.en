A '''dialysis catheter''' is a [[catheter]] used for exchanging [[blood]] to and from the [[hemodialysis]] machine from the patient. 

The dialysis catheter contains two [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]s: 
*[[Venous]]
*[[Arterial]]
This is a confusing terminology for layperson, because both lumens are in the vein.  The arterial lumen (typically red) withdraws blood from the patient and carries it to [[dialysis]] machine, while the venous lumen (typically blue) returns blood to the patient (from the dialysis machine). [[Volumetric flow rate|Flow rates]] of dialysis catheters range between 200 to 500 ml/min.  

If a patient requires long-term dialysis therapy, a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] dialysis catheter will be inserted.  Chronic catheters contain a [[dacron]] cuff that is tunneled beneath the skin approximately 3â€“8&nbsp;cm.  The tunnel is thought to add a barrier to infection.  The most popular dialysis catheter sold on the [[market]] today is the split-tip dialysis catheter.  This catheter comprises two free floating tips.

==Catheter placement==
The catheter is placed in one of the large [[vein]]s. A common site is [[superior vena cava]] or SVC. An SVC catheter is placed by puncturing the [[internal jugular vein]] in the [[neck]] (most often on the right side), and the catheter is then advanced downwards toward the chest. Alternatively an SVC catheter can be inserted via [[subclavian vein]]s right behind s can be used. This is an inferior option, however, because the [[groin]] site is more prone to [[infection]] and also because patient cannot sit upright.

==Complications==
Some common malfunctions of dialysis catheters include clotting, infection, and kinking.  One of the most common errors of tunnel hemodialysis catheter insertions is failure to locate the arterial limb of the catheter medially and the venous limb laterally. This must be done, because most catheters have a memory in the plastic, which will cause the catheter to try to resume its natural straight form. If the arterial limb is placed laterally, this will cause the arterial inlet to float up against the vein wall, or even up against the rim of the inlet of the atrium. This has the same effect as a vacuum cleaner hose sucking up against curtains. This results in poor blood flows, and can force the dialysis staff to reverse flow, using the venous limb of the catheter as the arterial. This will result in more inefficient dialysis, as there will be admixing of blood from the catheter (cleaning the same blood, over again).
