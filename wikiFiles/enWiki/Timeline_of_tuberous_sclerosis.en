The '''timeline of tuberous sclerosis''' discovery and research spans less than 200 years. [[Tuberous sclerosis]] (TSC) is a rare, multi-system [[genetic disorder|genetic disease]] that can cause benign tumours to grow on the [[human brain|brain]] or other vital organs such as the [[kidney]]s, [[human heart|heart]], [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human lung|lung]]s, and [[human skin|skin]]. A combination of symptoms may include [[seizure]]s, [[Mental retardation|developmental delay]], behavioural problems and skin abnormalities, as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by [[mutation]]s on either of two [[gene]]s, [[TSC1]] and [[TSC2]], which encode for the [[protein]]s '''hamartin''' and '''tuberin''' respectively. These proteins act as [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour growth suppressors]] and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.<ref name=NINDS>{{cite web

Further organ involvement was discovered, along with a realisation that the condition was highly variable in its severity. The late 20th century saw great improvements in [[neuroimaging|cranial imaging]] techniques and the discovery of the two genes. Finally, the start of the 21st century saw the beginning of a molecular understanding of the illness, along with possible non-surgical therapeutic treatments.
