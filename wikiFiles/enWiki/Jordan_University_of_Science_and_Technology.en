==History==
[[Image:JUSTuni4.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|The university reservoir as seen with the Engineering Buildings Complex in the background.]] 
JUST is a fast growing and dynamic university in Jordan. Though young, the university has expanded dramatically since its inception in 1986. A total of 2,300 students were enrolled in 1986. As of the academic year 2006/2007, about 20,000 [[undergraduate]] students and 1559 [[graduate school|graduate]] students were enrolled at the university.<ref name="History of Jordan University of Science and Technology">http://www.just.edu.jo/aboutjust/Pages/default.aspx</ref>

Each year the university grants over 3000 Bachelor and Master [[academic degree|Degrees]]. The university started with 110 [[teacher|faculty]] members; now it hosts 750 faculty, of which 109 are full professors. The steady enrollment of the student body is grounded on the university's vision to raise and maintain the standards of higher education in Jordan, in parallel with national educational policies.

Having its roots at [[Yarmouk University]] in Irbid, JUST emerged as an independent university on September 1, 1986. JUST detached five faculties from Yarmouk University to form its academic nucleus. These faculties were: Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Faculty of Nursing and Faculty of Engineering. Consecutively added to these faculties are Faculty of Science and Arts, Faculty of Medical Applied Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Computer and Information Technology, and Faculty of Agriculture.<ref name="History of Jordan University of Science and Technology"/>

JUST employs all possible means to remain a forefront institution amongst Jordanian universities. JUST leading theme is serving the national economy through qualifying graduates with the potentials to contribute to the productivity of the local industry, be it in the fields of medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, engineering, agriculture, veterinary medicine, computer science or natural sciences.<ref name="Mission"/> Over the course of the last two decades, JUST has been renowned for its capacity to adapt to the trends of modern technology; for its educational commitment; for its management; and for its investigation and research services.<ref name="History of Jordan University of Science and Technology"/><ref>http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/tempus/participating_countries/higher/jordan.pdf</ref>

==Campus==

The [[university campus]] is located in [[Ar Ramtha]], 70&nbsp;km north of [[Amman]], the capital, and 20&nbsp;km east of [[Irbid]], the second largest city in Jordan. It is centrally located at international crossroads to [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], and national roads to major cities in Jordan.<ref name="loc"/><ref name="loc1"/><ref name="loc2"/> It covers an area of approximately 11&nbsp;km², featuring the main buildings of a total area of 355m², constructed according to modern architectural designs suitable to the nature of its faculties. The main campus is surrounded by a green cover of 135m².<ref name="just.edu.jo"/> In addition to academic buildings and the [[Jordan University of Science and Technology#Library|JUST Library]], the campus includes the university farm, 12 auditoriums, a concert hall, fine arts galleries and museums, as well as comprising athletic facilities including a 7000-seat soccer stadium, a multipurpose indoor arena, a swimming pool, a [[squash (sport)|squash]] court, and a gym.

[[Image:JUSTpond.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The university reservoir at [[Jordan University of Science and Technology#Engineering Faculties Complex|The Engineering Faculties Complex]].]]
[[Image:JUSTmed.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Medical halls of JUST as seen with [[King Abdullah University Hospital|KAUH]].]]The university campus is divided into two sections, known as the '''[[Jordan University of Science and Technology#Medical Faculties Complex|Medical Faculties Complex]]''', a group of buildings in the northern part of the university, compromising the faculties of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Applied Medical Sciences, Pharmacy and Science and Arts, and the '''[[Jordan University of Science and Technology#Engineering Faculties Complex|Engineering Faculties Complex]]''', a group of buildings in the southern part of the university, compromising the faculties of Agriculture, Computer and Information Technology, Engineering, Architecture and Design and Veterinary Medicine. Students can use available buses to move from one complex to the other. Although there is a mini train on campus, it is not often used, and due to the relatively short distance between the two complexes many students prefer walking.

There are two libraries in JUST, one in the Engineering Faculties Complex and the other is in the Medical Faculties Complex. While both libraries give the students an appropriate and suitable place for reading and studying, the two-floor library at the Medical Faculties Complex is relatively larger, also contains 115,000 books, and 45,000 volumes of back issues of [[periodicals]], which makes it the main library at the university.<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.just.edu.jo/library/default.aspx The Library at Jordan University of Science and Technology]</ref> At the present time, a third library is being constructed in the area between the Engineering Faculties Complex and the Medical Faculties Complex which is larger in size than both existing libraries and is set to become the largest library in the Middle East.<ref name="library">http://oldwww.just.edu.jo/library/|JUST Library</ref>

Aside from the employees and guests restaurants, there are also three restaurants for students; one in each main campus, and one located near the soccer stadium. In addition, the Medicine Faculties Building contains a mini market where students can find items which they may not find in faculty restaurants.

Every department has a [[computer laboratory]] for the students to use. There are also two open labs one in each campus. Moreover, six additional labs are available for the [[graduate school|graduate]] and [[undergraduate]] computer science students and students who are taking related courses at the PH building located at the Medicine Faculties Building. The campus is covered by a secure [[wireless internet]] connection ([[WLAN]]) which can be accessed by each student upon registration from the computer science department in the Engineering Faculties Building.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=4000001061 Jordan University of Science and Technology Enhances Wireless Security with Easy-to-Manage Authentication Technology]</ref>

Of the many university gates, only two are most familiar to students, which are the main gate and the Engineering Faculties Complex's Gate. The main gate, which is newer than the other, leads approximately midway between the two complexes. The other gate leads directly to the faculties of engineering.

===King Abdullah University Hospital===

====Medicine====
The JUST Faculty of Medicine, the second [[medical school]] in Jordan, was established in [[Yarmouk University]] at the northern city of Irbid in 1984; the faculty then branched out into Jordan University of Science and Technology in 1986.<ref name="mededucation">"Medical education in Jordan." AHMAD FALEH TAMIMI(1) & FALEH TAMIMI(2); (1)Jordan University, Jordan, (2)McGill University, Canada.</ref> The faculty is closely associated with [[King Abdullah University Hospital]], the [[teaching hospital]] where [[postgraduate]] students undergo their residencies, and is considered one of the most prestigious schools of medicine in the Middle East.<ref name="med">http://www.just.edu.jo/facultiesanddepartments/facultyofmedicine/Pages/default.aspx</ref> 
As the faculty’s main teaching hospital, KAUH provide students with the opportunity to attend lectures, tutorials, clinics, ward rounds, and surgeries. Medical students graduating from JUST are widely renowned for their achievements in the United States Medical Licensing Examination ([[USMLE]]), gaining postgraduate positions in well-known global institutions.<ref>Dr. Faisal Bakaeen MD on Jordan's Medical Field | Jordan Business | Issue 54 | June 2009</ref> Furthermore, the Faculty of Medicine has been an active participant in medical research and has hosted numerous international events and conferences, with focus on subjects in relation to [[myocardial]] protection and research, [[pediatrics]], [[anesthesia]], and [[internal medicine]]. As of September 2011, the faculty will be hosting the [[Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists]] (FRC Path) Part 1 written exams in all Pathology specialties, which will enable Jordanian and Arab Pathologists to sit the exam outside the [[UK]].<ref>http://www.just.edu.jo/News/Lists/Activities/display.aspx?List=525a663d-304f-4420-a708-6adc93023c93&ID=175&RootFolder=%2FNews%2FLists%2FActivities&Web=79c410a4-cba9-460c-a9bb-dbc13ce3ee34</ref>

=====Nature of the Medical Program=====
The Faculty of Medicine awards the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (MBBS) after completion of six years comprising three years of [[medical sciences]] and three clinical years. Students are admitted to medicine based solely on their grade point average in their high school national general exam ([[Tawjihi]]); there are neither entrance interviews nor psychometric exams. The cutoff average used for admissions into medicine is the highest among all the other disciplines offered by universities. For example, the cutoff average used over the past five years has been: 94.9 (2005), 96.3 (2006), 97 (2007), 96.8 (2008), and 97.7 (2009). Although in the minority, the faculty of medicine accepts students from [[Israel]], [[Palestine]], [[Syria]], Arab states of the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Malaysia]], and other countries. Tuition is significantly higher for the foreign students. Initially, the faculty at JUST accepted 50 students into the program, but that number has grown to more than 200 in recent years.<ref name='dabbo'>Medicine in Jordan: A Cross-Cultural Elective Experience | Samer Dabbo (1T1), Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Jordan University of Science and Technology.</ref>

Although initially taught in a Modular system-based format, innovative changes were introduced into the curriculum at JUST in 1999. Balancing basic science principles, clinical skills, and psychosocial concepts, the new curriculum placed the student at the centre. Rather than relying on the teacher to deliver knowledge, students were empowered to become more self-directed in their learning.
During the first year and a half of their program, students are taught basic science in a traditional format. In an integrated
module fashion, the next year and half is devoted to studying nine [[body systems]]: [[cardiovascular]], [[respiratory]], [[hematopoietic]], [[digestion|digestive]], [[endocrine]], [[musculoskeletal]], [[neuroscience]] 1 and 2, and [[reproductive]] and [[urinary]]. Towards the end of the third year students begin direct contact with patients in hospital settings. The last three years are spent in supervised inpatient and outpatient settings to develop their diagnostic and treatment competencies; the clinical years begin fully at the beginning of year 4 where students rotate through various areas of general clinical medicine. Year 5 continues this pattern focusing more on specialized areas of medicine and surgery.<ref name="mededucation"/> In total, students are required to complete 257 hours of classes divided among compulsory and elective courses. After completion of their 6th year, students are required to complete internship (imtiaz), which is a one-year term in general practice for which they are not compensated for.<ref name='dabbo'/>

Evaluations are based primarily on written exams (marks are based on two midterms and one end of term exam) and percentage grades appear on transcripts. Practical exams are solely based on an [[objective structured clinical examination]] (OSCE) type of standardized exams. In the final year, the school of medicine invites external examiners (from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], among others) to participate in student evaluations and to benefit from the experience of others.<ref name='dabbo'/>

=====Residency=====
Students looking to specialize can apply for residency programs after completion of imtiaz (internship). Most residency programs are four years in length, but notable exceptions include [[neurosurgery]] (6 years), [[general surgery]] (5 years), [[orthopedic surgery]] (5 years), and [[urology]] (5 years). Residency programs are divided into two broad groups: major and minor specialties. Major programs include internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, while the rest are considered minor. This division reflects the number of available seats and thus the competitiveness of each specialty.<ref name='dabbo'/> [http://www.just.edu.jo/faculty/welcome.aspx?fac_id=3 Faculty of Medicine]

===Research===
Since its establishment, JUST has given its utmost priority to academic research. In this vein, the '''Deanship of Research''' commenced its activities at the early stages of the university establishment during the academic year 1986/1987. Research, basic and applied, is amongst the principal priorities of the university. Training and supervision in research methodology, especially for postgraduate students, is reinforced by several research centers, such as the [[Queen Rania]] Center for Environmental Science and Technology, Consultative Center for Science and Technology, Energy Center, Pharmaceutical Research Center, [[Princess Haya Biotechnology Center]], and the Agricultural Center for Research & Production.<ref name="res">http://www.just.edu.jo/Deanships/DeanshipofResearch/Pages/Highlights.aspx</ref>

Research funding has steadily grown since the establishment of JUST in 1986, and an average of 200 research projects are sponsored and funded each year. As testimony to this development,  JUST was ranked as the top [[research university]] in Jordan, and amongst the top 3% universities in the [[Islamic world]], according to a study carried out by the Ankara-based Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Center for Islamic Countries (SESRTCIC).<ref name="research"/>

[[Nature (journal)|Nature Journal]] has reported Jordan as having the highest number of researchers in [[research and development]] per million people among all the 57 countries members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC). In Jordan there are 2,000 researchers per million people, while the average among the members of OIC is 500 researchers per million people.<ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444026a.html</ref> This means that the number of researchers per population in Jordan, is higher than Italy, [[Israel]] and Greece and just close to the number in [[United Kingdom]] and Ireland.<ref>http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_res_in_ram_per_mil_peo-amp-d-per-million-people</ref><ref>http://www.jordaninvestment.com/BusinessandInvestment/PeopleDemographicsLabor/ResearchDevelopment/tabid/171/language/en-US/Default.aspx</ref>

The importance of scientific research and progress in the technological applications of science has been one of the top priorities of JUST. These priorities come in complete harmony with the strategic plans of Jordan as a country to improve the quality of life of [[Jordanians]], participate in leading the frontiers of scientific research in the region and worldwide, and be recognized as a major stakeholder in the process of development internationally.<ref>http://www.just.edu.jo/Deanships/DeanshipofResearch/Pages/welcome.aspx</ref>

The Deanship of Research at JUST is the administrative and technical body that facilitates, regulates and observes the processes that serve to promote and fulfill the vision, mission and objectives of the university concerning research. It works in a collaborative and complementary manner with other faculties and administrative bodies of the university. Any research on humans should be approved by the Institutional Research Board (IRB) and any research on animals should be approved by the university Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) before being funded.<ref name="res"/> [http://www.just.edu.jo/Deanships/DeanshipofResearch/Pages/welcome.aspx Deanship of Research]
