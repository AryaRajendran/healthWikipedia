'''Barodontalgia''', commonly known as '''tooth squeeze''' and previously known as '''aerodontalgia''', is a [[dental pain|pain]] in [[tooth]] caused by a change in [[atmospheric pressure]].

In pilots, barodontalgia may be severe enough to cause premature cessation of flights.<ref name=BDJ/>
 
Most of the available data regarding barodontalgia is derived from [[high-altitude chamber]] simulations rather than actual flights. Barodontalgia [[prevalence]] was between 0.7% and 2% in the 1940s, and 0.3% in the 1960s.<ref name=Dehart/> 

Similarly, cases of barodontalgia were reported in 0.3% of high altitude-chamber simulations in the [[Luftwaffe]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goethe, WH; Bäter, H; Laban, C |title=Barodontalgia and barotrauma in the human teeth: findings in navy divers, frogmen, and submariners of the Federal Republic of Germany |journal=Mil Med |volume=154 |issue=10 |pages=491–5 |year=1989 |month=October |pmid=2515472 }}</ref>

The rate of barodontalgia was about 1 case per 100 flight-years in the [[Israel]]i [[Israeli air force|Air Force]].<ref name=aviation>{{cite journal |author=Zadik, Yehuda; Chapnik, L; Goldstein, L |title=In-flight barodontalgia: analysis of 29 cases in military aircrew |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=593–6 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17571660 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2007/00000078/00000006/art00009  |accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref> During [[World War II]], about one-tenth of [[United States of America|American]] aircrews had one or more episodes of barodontalgia.<ref name=BDJ>{{cite journal |author=Zadik, Yehuda |title=Aviation dentistry: current concepts and practice |journal=British Dental Journal |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=11–6 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19132029 |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v206/n1/pdf/sj.bdj.2008.1121.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-26 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2008.1121}}</ref> In a recent study, 8.2% of 331 Israeli Air Force aircrews, reported at least one episode of barodontalgia.<ref name=aviation/> 

Barodontalgia is a [[symptom]] of [[dental disease]], for example [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[cyst]] in the [[human mandible|mandible]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik, Yehuda |title=Barodontalgia due to odontogenic inflammation in the jawbone |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=77 |issue=8 |pages=864–6 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16909883 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2006/00000077/00000008/art00013  |accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref>
Indeed, most of the common oral pathologies have been reported as possible sources of barodontalgia: [[dental caries]], defective [[tooth restoration]], [[pulpitis]], [[pulp necrosis]], [[periapical periodontitis|apical periodontitis]], [[periodontal pocket]]s, [[impacted tooth|impacted teeth]], and [[mucous retention cyst]]s. One exception is barodontalgia manifested as referred pain from [[barotrauma|barosinusitis]] or barotitis-media. The latter two conditions are generated from pressure changes rather than pressure-related flare-up of pre-existing conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik, Yehuda |title=Barodontalgia |journal=J Endod |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=481–5 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19345791 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B82X7-4VPKR45-2&_user=10&_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2009&_rdoc=4&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%2333023%232009%23999649995%231030066%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=33023&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=30&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=939bae3affd716753f70a314a4b0b935 |accessdate=2009-06-01 |doi=10.1016/j.joen.2008.12.004}}</ref>
A [[meta-analysis]] of studies conducted between 2001 and 2010<ref name=Whatwe>{{cite journal |author=Zadik, Yehuda |title=Barodontalgia: what have we learned in the past decade? |journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=e65–9 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20303049 |url=http://www.ooooe.net/article/S1079-2104(09)00915-9/abstract|doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2009.12.001}}</ref> reveled a rate of 5 episodes/1,000 flight-years. [[Maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandibular]] [[dentition]]s were affected equally in flight, but in diving, maxillary dentition was affected more than the mandibular dentition, which can indicate a greater role for [[maxillary sinus]] pathology in diving barodontalgia.<ref name=Whatwe /> Surprisingly, despite the [[cabin pressurization]] - the current in-flight barodontalgia incidence is similar to the incidence in the first half of the 20th century; despite the more fluctuation in divers' pressures - the weighted incidence of barodontalgia among aircrews are similar to the weighted incidence among divers; and as opposed to a common belief, and in contrast to diving conditions - the role of facial barotrauma in the etiology of in-flight barodontalgia is only minor (about one-tenth of cases).<ref name=Whatwe />

== Classification ==
The [[FDI World Dental Federation|Fédération dentaire internationale]] describes 4 classes of barodontalgia.<ref name=class/> The classes are based on signs and symptoms. They also provide specific and valuable recommendations for therapeutic intervention.<ref name=class/>
