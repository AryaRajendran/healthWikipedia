It preferentially deaminates [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), [[serotonin]], and [[dopamine]] (dopamine is equally deaminated by MAO-A and MAO-B). 

It is inhibited by [[clorgyline]] and [[befloxatone]]. Inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B using a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAO inhibitor) is used in the treatment of [[clinical depression]],[[erectile disfunction]] and [[anxiety]].

==Function==
Monoamine oxidase A is an enzyme that degrades amine [[neurotransmitter]]s, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The protein localizes to the [[outer mitochondrial membrane]]. Its encoding gene is adjacent to a related gene ([[MAOB]]) on the opposite strand of the [[X chromosome]]. Mutation in this gene results in monoamine oxidase deficiency, or [[Brunner syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: MAOA monoamine oxidase A | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=4128}}</ref>

==Clinical significance==
In humans, there is a 30-base [[Variable number tandem repeat|repeat sequence]] repeated in one of several different numbers of times in the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter region]] of the gene coding for MAO-A. There are 2R (two repeats), 3R, 3.5R, 4R, and 5R variants of the repeat sequence, with the 3R and 4R variants most common in Caucasians. The 3.5R and 4R variants have been found to be more highly active than 3R or 5R, in a study which did not examine the 2R variant.<ref name="pmid18212819">{{cite journal | author = Guo G, Ou XM, Roettger M, Shih JC | title = The VNTR 2 repeat in MAOA and delinquent behavior in adolescence and young adulthood: associations and MAOA promoter activity | journal = Eur.

Clorgyline, an MAO-A enzyme inhibitor, prevents apoptosis in melanoma cells, in vitro.<ref name="pietrangeli">{{cite journal | author = Pietrangeli P, Mondovi B | title = Amine oxidases and tumors | journal = Neurotoxicology | volume = 25 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 317–24 | year = 2004 | month = January | pmid = 14697906 | doi = 10.1016/S0161-813X(03)00109-8 }}</ref>  Cholangiocarcinoma suppresses MAOA expression, and those patients with higher MAOA expression had less adjacent organ invasion and better prognosis and survival.<ref name="huang">{{cite journal | author = Huang L, Frampton G, Rao A, Zhang KS, Chen W, Lai JM, Yin XY, Walker K, Culbreath B, Leyva-Illades D, Quinn M, McMillin M, Bradley M, Liang LJ, DeMorrow S | title = Monoamine oxidase A expression is suppressed in human cholangiocarcinoma via coordinated epigenetic and IL-6-driven events | journal = Lab Invest. | volume = 92 | issue = 10 | pages = 1451–60 | year = 2012 | month = October | pmid = 22906985 | doi = 10.1038/labinvest.2012.110 }}</ref>
