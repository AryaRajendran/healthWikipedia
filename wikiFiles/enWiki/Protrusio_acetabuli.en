'''Protrusio acetabuli''' is an uncommon defect of the [[acetabulum]].  The acetabulum is the socket that receives the [[femoral head]] to make the hip joint.  The [[hip bone]] of the [[pelvic bone]]/girdle is composed of three [[bone]]s, the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], the [[ischium]] and the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]].  In protrusio deformity, there is medial displacement of the femoral head in that the medial aspect of the femoral cortex is medial to the ilioischial line. The socket is too deep and may protrude into the [[pelvis]]. <ref name="pmid17152413">{{cite journal |author=Van De Velde S, Fillman R, Yandow S |title=The aetiology of protrusio acetabuli.

==Classification==

Protrusio acetabuli is divided into two types, primary and secondary.

===''Primary'' protrusio acetabuli===

* Characterized by progressive protrusio in middle aged women
* May be associated with OA
* May be [[familial]]

===''Secondary'' protrusio acetabuli===
      
Causes include:

* Femoral head [[prosthesis]]
* Cup [[arthroplasty]]
* [[Septic arthritis]]
* Central [[fracture dislocation]]
* [[Total hip replacement]] [[surgery]]

Protrusio acetabuli may also be thought of as unilateral or bilateral. 
===''Unilateraly'' protrusio acetabuli===
*Tuberculous arthritis
*Trauma
*Fibrous dysplasia

===''Bilateral'' protrusio acetabuli===
*Rheumatoid arthritis
*Paget disease
*Osteomalacia

In addition, protrusio acetabuli may be present bilaterally in [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[Marfan syndrome]],<ref name="pmid16510833">{{cite journal |author=Van de Velde S, Fillman R, Yandow S |title=Protrusio acetabuli in Marfan syndrome.

==Signs and Symptoms==

* May be [[asymptomatic]]
* Limitation of joint range of movement is the earliest sign
* Pain

==Natural course==

The protrusio may progress until the femoral neck impinges against the pelvis.

==Treatment==

Arthroscopic surgery (or open joint surgery) is an effective treatment. Joint replacement surgery may be necessary in the case of severe pain or substantial joint restriction.
Prominent trabeculae.     * Normal sacro-iliac joints and symphysis pubis.
