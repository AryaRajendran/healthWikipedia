[[File:Aspartylglucosaminuria.jpg|thumb|Physical Characteristics of Aspartylglucosaminuria]]
'''Aspartylglucosaminuria''' ( commonly referred to as AGU) is an inherited disease that is characterized by a decline in mental functioning, accompanied by an increase in skin bone and joint issues. This disease is caused by a defect in an enzyme known as [[aspartylglucosaminidase]]. This enzyme plays a significant role in our body because it aids in breaking down certain sugars ( for example [[oligosaccharides]]) that are attached to specific proteins ( for example: [[glycoproteins]]). Aspartylglucosaminuria itself is characterized as a [[lysosomal]] disease because it does deal with inadequate activity in an enzymes function.<ref name=ismrd>[
http://www.ismrd.org/the_diseases/aspartylglucosaminuria]</ref> Aspartylglucosaminidase function is to break down glycoproteins. These proteins are most abundant in the tissues of the body and in the surfaces of major organs, such as: the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[thyroid]] and nerves. When glycoproteins are unable to be broken down then it causes aspartylglucosaminidase to back up in the [[lysosome]]s along with other substances. This back up causes damage to the tissues and organs that is progressive.<ref name=labcorp>[http://www.labcorp.com/wps/wcm/connect/IntGeneticsLib/integratedgenetics/resources/diseases/aspartylglucosaminuria?Aspartylglucosaminuria]</ref>
　

==Signs and Symptoms of Aspartylglucosaminuria==
At birth, there is no signs that a child will develop symptoms of Aspartylglucosaminuria. Typically, signs and symptoms become apparent between two and four years of age and become progressively worse as the individual gets older. The signs and symptoms an individual may see are as follows-<ref name=labcorp/>
　
* Individuals are more prone to respiratory infections
* Development of [[scoliosis]]
* [[Seizures]] or difficulty with movement
* Skin and joints may become loose
* Facial features change progressively and includes-
::::#thickening of the skin
::::#features become more prominent
::::#large head
::::#broad lower jaw
::::# a short broad nose
::::#rounded cheeks <ref name=labcorp/>
*Progression of developmental and mental disabilities including-
::::# progressive loss of speech
::::#decrease in mental functioning
::::#before school age concentration lowers
::::#development continues, but becomes slower then usual <ref name=labcorp/>
*An intellectual peak occurs in your mid teens and allows a plateau for the disease. Once an individual hits the age of 25-30 the decrease begins again and includes:
::::#learned skills become lost which result in severe learning disabilities
::::#motor skills deteriorate
::::#individuals become less mobile and more dependent
(Children are physically uncoordinated, but remain able to play sports and do everyday activities until they reach adulthood)
*During the first year of life [[inguinal hernia|inguinal]] and [[umbilical hernia|umbilical]] hernias are common
* Less severe symptoms include-
::::#enlargement of the spleen and liver
::::#[[diarrhea]]
*People with Aspartylglucosaminuria may have an average height lower than the rest of the population due to because they tend to go through puberty earlier
* [[Epilepsy]] may develop in adulthood
* Finland studies have shown that life expectancy is shorter than the average life expectancy.<ref name=social>[

==Inheritance of Aspartylglucosaminuria==
This disease isn’t [[contagious disease|contagious]] therefore you cannot not catch aspartylglucosaminuria. It is a [[genetics|genetic]] condition that must be inherited from both parents. You are born with two copies of the gene AGU. One copy comes from the mother’s [[Ovum|egg]] and the other copy comes from the father’s [[sperm]].<ref name=ismrd/>In order to develop aspartylglucosaminuria, the individual must inherit changes in both of their AGU genes (autonomic recessive inheritance). If a child has aspartylglucosaminuria, their child received a changed copy of the [[AGU]] from both parents. When a person receives one changed form of the gene AGU from one of the parents, the individual is then classified as a carrier.<ref name=ghr>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/aspartylglucosaminuria]</ref>

==Diagnosis of Aspartylglucosaminuria==
In order to be diagnosed with AGU an individual needs to take a urine test, which will show indication of an increased amount of aspartylglucosamin being [[secreted]]. The confirmation of the diagnosis of aspartylglucosaminuria requires the individual to take a [[blood test]]. The blood test helps show if the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase is present or partially absent. A skin simple taken from the individual also will show the amount of aspartylglucosaminidase present.<ref name=social/>

==Pre-natal Diagnosis==
When families have a child that has already been diagnosed with AGU, they have the option to observe the enzymes activity that codes for AGU in future pregnancy to help determine if the next child will also have a positive diagnosis for aspartylglucosaminuria.<ref name=ismrd/>
==Treatments for Aspartylglucosaminuria==
No treatment is available to cure or slow down the progression of aspartylglucosaminuria. Attempts to replace the missing enzyme by a [[bone marrow transplant]] have been conducted in hope that the bone marrow will produce the missing enzyme. The results to the tests thus far have shown to be inconclusive. <ref name=ismrd/>

==Preventions/Interventions to Signs and Symptoms==
à
Since ear infections and respiratory infections are common for children diagnosed with aspartylglucosaminuria, it is best to have regular check ups for both the ears and the respiratory tract.
à
Extreme sensitivity to the sun’s rays may develop and the best way to protect an individual diagnosed with aspartylglucosaminuria is to have them wear sunglasses, hats or caps to protect their eyes.
à
Epilepsy and [[insomnia]] can both be treated with medication.
à
It will be most beneficial to children who are diagnosed with AGU to have receive an education from a school with special teaching.<ref name=social/>
==Habilitation==
The process of [[habilitation]] for individuals diagnosed with AGU needs to be established in their early stages of life. The team for habilitation should include professionals that are experienced in disabilities and the effects that having a disability can have on everyday life. Habilitation will include assessments, assistance with the choice of aids and information concerning disabilities and counseling.<ref name=social/>
==How common is AGU? And Who is at risk for AGU?==
Aspartylglucosaminuria is estimated to affect 1 in 18,500 people in [[Finland]]. This condition is less common outside of Finland, but the incidence is unknown.<ref name=ghr/>Even though this disease can occur in various races and ethnicities, another study made backed this finding up by stating that 1 in 26,000 people in Finland had the disease and that 1 in 18,000 were carriers of aspartylglucosaminuria.<ref name=labcorp/>



After [[trisomy 21]] and [[fragile X syndrome]], this is the most frequent multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome.<ref name=inane>{{cite web

==Life Expectancy==
Individuals with AGU typically have normal development in infancy. Around the age of 2–4 years, they begin showing signs of developmental delay, but development is still progressing. Initial symptoms may present as clumsiness and/or [[speech delay]]. Individuals with AGU also show increased upper respiratory infections. Development continues until about puberty, however, individuals at 13–16 years of age typically show mental and motor development similar to a 5-6 year old. Around puberty, a gradual decline in mental abilities and motor skills occurs. This progressive decline continues until about 25–28 years of age, when rapid impairment of abilities occurs, resulting in severe mental retardation.<ref name=social/>

==Various Studies Conducted Around the World==

Aspartylglucosaminuria was first reported by Jenner and Pollitt (1967) Pollitt also aided in finding the urinary [[excretion]] amounts of 2-acetamido-1-(beta-L-aspartamido)-1,2-dideoxyglucose in a 32-year-old female and her 20-year-old brother with mental retardation.An [[enzyme]] responsible for hydrolyzing this compound is normally present in [[seminal fluid]] but was absent in that of the brother. A generalized lack of this enzyme was [[postulated]]. Both sibs had thick sagging skin of the cheeks, a finding not present in normal members of the family. Palo and Mattsson (1970) reported 11 cases in Finland. The parents of 1 patient were first cousins. The Finnish cases showed, in addition to severe mental retardation, sagging cheeks, broad nose and face, short neck, cranial asymmetry, [[scoliosis]], periodic hyperactivity, and vacuolated [[lymphocytes]]. Diarrhea and frequent infections were problems in infancy. Aspartylglucosaminuria has also been observed in Finns living in Norway (Borud and Torp, 1976). Gehler(1981) described affected brother and sister in a [[consanguineous]] Italian sibship; one of the patients showed [[angiokeratoma corporis diffusum]]. Yoshida (1991) and Vargas-Diez et al. (2002) also described the occurrence of [[angiokeratoma]] corporis diffusum in 2 Japanese patients and 1 Spanish patient, respectively, with
aspartylglucosaminuria.
  
Stevenson et al. (1982) reported this disorder in an 18-year-old American. The family name was Scottish-Irish. The mother was said to have been aged 13 years and the father was unknown—circumstances suggesting [[incest]]. [[Mental retardation]], recurrent infections, [[cardiomyopathy]], and emotional lability were features. Hreidarsson et al. (1983) reported a case in an American black and an American white of uncertain parentage. [[Radiographic]] changes in the hands
were noted: thin [[epiphyses]], broad 'poorly modeled'  [[metacarpals]], and peculiarly shaped carpal bones.
  
Isenberg and Sharp (1975) reported the case of a girl of Mexican-Italian extraction living in the U.S. Chitayat et al. (1988) described 3 Puerto Rican brothers, with first-cousin parents, who had AGU. Two of the brothers were [[monozygotic twins]]. [[Macroorchidism]] became evident in all 3 boys at the time of puberty. This feature had not previously been noted in AGU, although other endocrinologic abnormalities had been described. Yoshida et al. (1991) described the first Japanese patients with AGU—a brother and sister, aged 45 and 41, respectively. Both sibs had mental retardation, coarse facial features, [[angiokeratoma]], and [[myoclonic seizures]]. Zlotogora et al. (1997) diagnosed this disorder in 8 patients originating from 3 unrelated families, all Palestinian Arabs from the region of Jerusalem. Gordon et al. (1998) described a Canadian family in which 4 of 12 sibs were affected, 2 brothers and 2 sisters. Though apparently normal at birth, their developmental milestones, particularly speech, were slow, and they acquired only a simple vocabulary. There was a progressive coarsening of facial features; 3 had [[inguinal hernia]] and recurrent diarrhea; all became severely retarded and by the fourth decade showed evident deterioration of both cognitive and motor skills; and 2 exhibited cyclic behavioral changes. Three of the sibs had died, at 33,39, and 44 years of age.<ref> http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?omim+208400</ref>
