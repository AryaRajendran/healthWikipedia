'''Vayarin''', a once-daily [[formulation]] of [[phosphatidylserine]]-[[omega 3]] compound, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]]-enriched, is a [[Medical prescription|prescription]] [[medical food]] for the [[clinical care|clinical]] dietary [[management]] of certain [[lipid]] imbalance associated with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] in children. Vayarin was developed by [[VAYAPharma]] (a division of [[Enzymotec LTD]]), a [[specialty pharmaceutical]] company. The VAYA Pharma [[Patent portfolio|portfolio]] addresses three therapeutic segments: [[ADHD]] (Vayarin), Hypertriglyceridemia ([[Vayarol]]) and Memory impairment ([[Vayacog]]).

Vayarin represents a new approach to helping manage [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] symptoms in children. It is a [[medical food]] regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) under the [[Orphan Drug Act]] and is intended for the distinct [[nutritional]] requirements of children under a physician’s supervision and by prescription only.

== Background ==
=== Phosphatidylserine and omega-3 fatty acids ===
[[Phospholipids]], such as [[phosphatidylserine]] (PS), are a class of [[lipids]] that serve as the major building blocks for all [[cell membrane]]s. PS, a vital [[phospholipid]], plays an important role in the normal functioning of brain [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Human brain cell [[Cell membrane|membrane]]s are highly enriched with PS, as compared to other tissues. [[Nerve]] cells in particular, depend on healthy membrane function for normal neuro-transmitter metabolism and nerve signal transmission. PS levels in these tissues ensure membrane fluidity and structure. Furthermore, maintaining brain PS levels has been found to be associated with normal and efficient [[signal transduction]] processes, efficient [[glucose]] consumption and other biological pathways that are crucial for ensuring normal and healthy [[cognitive]] and  [[mind|mental]] functions.<ref>McDaniel, M.A., S.F. Maier, and G.O. Einstein, “Brain-specific” nutrients: a memory cure? Nutrition, 2003. 19(11-12): p. 957-75</ref><ref>Mozzi, R., S. Buratta, and G. Goracci, Metabolism and functions of phosphatidylserine in mammalian brain. Neurochem Res, 2003. 28(2): p. 195-214</ref><ref>Pepeu, G., I.M. Pepeu, and L.

Prog Lipid Res, 2005. 44(4): p. 207-34</ref> [[Chemically]], the PS molecule consists of a glycerol-phosphate backbone, [[serine]] and two [[fatty acids]]. It is an amphipatic molecule due to the negatively charged head group (hydrophilic) and its fat-soluble fatty acid tails (lipophilic). The fatty acid composition of [[endogenous]] PS depends on its localization and function in the cell. For instance, brain and eye PS are highly enriched with [[Omega-3]] fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids that have been found to have unique and important health benefits. [[Epidemiological]] studies <ref>Hibbeln, J.R., Fish consumption and major depression. Lancet, 1998. 351(9110): p. 1213</ref><ref>Noaghiul, S. and J.R. Hibbeln, Cross-national comparisons of seafood consumption and rates of bipolar disorders. Am J Psychiatry, 2003. 160(12): p. 2222-7</ref> suggest that dietary consumption of Omega-3 LC-PUFA, especially [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]], affect neuropsychiatric disorders, presumably due to their structural and neurochemical involvement in [[pathophysiological]] processes.

=== Decreased levels of omega-3 fatty acid are associated with ADHD ===
Several studies indicate that decreased levels of Omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with several [[neuropsychiatric conditions]], including, attention deficit <ref>Tully, A.M., et al., Low serum cholesteryl ester-docosahexaenoic acid levels in Alzheimer’s disease: a case-control study. Br J Nutr, 2003. 89(4): p. 483-9</ref> [[schizophrenia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[ADHD]].<ref name="Young, G.">Young, G. and J. Conquer, Omega-3 fatty acids and neuropsychiatric disorders. Reprod Nutr Dev, 2005. 45(1): p. 1-28</ref> Poor metabolism of Omega-3 LC-PUFA has been suspected to be associated with ADHD since 1980s. It has been reported that [[blood plasma|plasma]] and red blood cells levels of EPA and DHA were significantly lower in ADHD patients as compared to control groups . Similar observations were also reported in ADHD adults.<ref name="Young, G."/> Accordingly, it was hypothesized that supplementation of LC-PUFA, like EPA and DHA, may lead to an improvement in the symptoms of ADHD. However, the results of supplementation of these LC-PUFAs with or without [[vitamins]] have been inconclusive.<ref>Hirayama,S., Hamazaki,T. and K.

== Composition ==
Two Vayarin capsules provide:

*[[Phosphatidylserine]] (PS):  150&nbsp;mg
*[[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA):  43&nbsp;mg
*[[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA):  17&nbsp;mg

==  Administration and dosing ==
Vayarin is specially formulated for children's consumption, it is available as hard shell [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]s that can be opened and sprinkled on food. It is not a [[stimulant]] or a controlled substance and has no potential for abuse or dependence.
Vayarin recommended dose is two capsules once a day or as directed by a physician.

== Clinical data ==
Vayarin was evaluated in a 30-week [[clinical trial]]. The first phase of the study consisted of a 15-weeks [[double-blind]], [[randomized]], [[placebo-controlled]] study of 200 ADHD children.<ref>Manor, I., et al., The effect of Phosphatidylserine containing Omega3 fatty acids on Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms in Children - Part I: A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial. European Psychiatry 2011</ref> Significant differences were observed between Vayarin and placebo groups in [Conners’ rating scales] and [child health questionnaire] scores. In addition, subgroup analysis of children with a hyperactive/impulsive behavior, as well as mood and behavior-dysregulation, revealed a more pronounced reduction in ADHD scores. The double-blind phase was followed by an open-label extension of additional 15-weeks during which all children received Vayarin. Safety data, obtained during both the [[double-blind]] study and the open-label extension, showed that Vayarin was well tolerated with no significant side effects.These results are consistent with previously reported beneficial effects of [[phosphatidylserine]]-omega 3 compound in ADHD children.<ref>Vaisman, N., et al., Correlation between changes in blood fatty acid composition and visual sustained attention performance in children with inattention: effect of dietary n-3 fatty acids containing phospholipids.
