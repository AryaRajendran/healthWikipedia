'''Terminal illness''' is a [[medical terminology|medical term]] popularized in the 20th century to describe a [[disease]] that cannot be cured or adequately treated and that is reasonably expected to result in the [[death]] of the patient within a  short period of time.  This term is more commonly used for progressive diseases such as [[cancer]] or advanced [[heart disease]] than for [[Physical trauma|trauma]].  In popular use, it indicates a disease which will eventually end the life of the sufferer.

A patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a '''terminal patient''', '''terminally ill''' or simply '''terminal'''. Often, a patient is considered to be terminally ill when the life expectancy is estimated to be six months or less, under the assumption that the disease will run its normal course. The six-month standard is arbitrary,<ref name="titleTerminal Illness">{{cite web |url=http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/issues/terminal.asp |title=Terminal Illness |accessdate=2008-02-09 |format= |work=}}</ref> and best available estimates of longevity may be incorrect.  Consequently, though a given patient may properly be considered terminal, this is not a guarantee that the patient will die within six months.  Similarly, a patient with a slowly progressing disease, such as [[AIDS]], may not be considered terminally ill because the best estimates of longevity were greater than six months. However this does not guarantee that the patient will not die unexpectedly early. In general, physicians slightly overestimate survival so that, for example, a person who is expected to live for about six weeks would likely die around four weeks.<ref name="pmid12881260">{{cite journal |author=Glare P |title=A systematic review of physicians' survival predictions in terminally ill cancer patients |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=327 |issue=7408 |pages=195–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12881260 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7408.195 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12881260 |pmc=166124 |author-separator=, |author2=Virik K |author3=Jones M |display-authors=3 |last4=Hudson |first4=M |last5=Eychmuller |first5=S |last6=Simes |first6=J |last7=Christakis |first7=N}}</ref>

== Stages ==
Each patient reacts differently to the news of carrying a terminal illness such as cancer. In general, almost all patients go through various [[Kuebler-Ross model|stages of acceptance]] when a disease like cancer has been diagnosed.<ref name="Pass-2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Pass | first1 = OM. | last2 = Morrison | first2 = T. | title = Toni Morrison's Beloved: a journey through the pain of grief | journal = J Med Humanit | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–24 | month =  | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1007/s10912-006-9010-0 | pmid = 16773441 }}</ref>

The first stage is disbelief. Most people are shocked that it could happen to them, there is extreme [[anxiety]] especially about the unknown. [[Acute stress reaction|Shock]], [[Despair (emotion)|despair]] and [[anger]] are common. There is also guilt that perhaps the person has done something wrong to receive such a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].<ref>University of Virginia Health System. [http://healthsystem.virginia.edu/UVAHealth/hub_cancer/copeterm.cfm "Coping with terminal cancer"] 2010-02-09.{{Dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> Some individuals use humor as a psychological [[defense mechanism]]; others become helpless and often start to bargain. This first stage usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks.

The second stage is [[Depression (mood)|depression]] which is usually a reaction to the diagnosis. The depression is mild to moderate in intensity and needs family support. Only in rare cases is any type of medical [[therapy]] required.

Duration of depression often can last several weeks but soon fades and the person goes into the final stage of acceptance.

== Management ==
{{main|End-of-life care}}
By definition, there is no cure or adequate treatment for terminal illnesses.  However, some kinds of medical treatments may be appropriate anyway, such as treatment to reduce pain or ease breathing.

Some terminally ill patients stop all debilitating treatments to reduce unwanted side effects.  Others continue aggressive treatment in the hope of an unexpected success. Still others reject conventional medical treatment and pursue [[unproven cancer therapy|unproven treatments]] such as radical dietary modifications.  Patients' choices about different treatments may change over time.<ref name="pmid17608872">{{cite journal |author=Fried TR, O'leary J, Van Ness P, Fraenkel L |title=Inconsistency over time in the preferences of older persons with advanced illness for life-sustaining treatment  |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=1007–14 |year=2007 |pmid=17608872 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01232.x |pmc=1948955}}</ref>

[[Palliative care]] is normally offered to terminally ill patients, regardless of their overall disease management style, if it seems likely to help manage symptoms such as pain and improve quality of life.  Hospice care, which can be provided at home or in a long-term care facility, additionally provides emotional and spiritual support for the patient and loved ones.  Some [[complementary medicine]] approaches, such as relaxation therapy,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Integration of behavioral and relaxation approaches into the treatment of chronic pain and insomnia.

=== Caregiving ===
For the person with a terminal illness, a [[Companion (caregiving)|caregiver]] is often needed. The caregiver may be a [[nurse]], licensed practical nurse or a family member. The individual may require assistance from a caregiver to receive medications for pain and to control symptoms of [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]]. The caregiver can assist the individual with daily living activities and assist with movement. Caregivers provide assistance with food and [[psychology|psychological]] support and ensure that the individual is comfortable.

The patient's family may have questions and most caregivers can provide information to help ease the mind. Doctors generally do not provide estimates for fear of instilling false hopes or obliterate an individual's hope.<ref>University of Texas Cancer therapy and research center. [http://www.ctrc.net/ctrc_2_2.cfm?db_content=psycopingterminal "Terminal Cancer Overview"] 2010-02-09.</ref>
In most cases, the caregiver works along with physicians and follows professional instructions. Caregivers may call the physician or a nurse if the individual:
* experiences excessive pain.
* is in distress or having difficulty [[breathing]].
* has difficulty passing urine or is [[constipation|constipated]].
* has fallen and appears hurt.
* is depressed and wants to harm themselves.
* refuses to take prescribed medications, raising [[Medical ethics|ethical]] concerns best addressed by a person with more extensive formal training.
* or if the caregiver does not know how to handle the situation.

Most caregivers become the patient's listeners and will allow the individual to express their fears and concerns without being [[judgment]]al. Caregivers reassure the patient and honor all advanced directives. Caregivers respect the individual's need for privacy and usually hold all information confidential.<ref>[http://healthsystem.virginia.edu/uvahealth/hub_cancer/phyneeds.cfm Physical Needs of the Person With Terminal Cancer] University of Virginia. Retrieved on 2010-02-09</ref>

== Refusal of nutrition and hydration ==
People who feel they are near the end of their life often refuse food and/or water.  Published studies indicate that "within the context of adequate palliative care, the refusal of food and fluids does not contribute to suffering among the terminally ill", and might actually contribute to a comfortable passage from life: "At least for some persons, starvation does correlate with reported [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]."<ref>[http://www.dyingwell.com/prnh.htm Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration: Walking the Ever-Finer Line] American Journal Hospice & Palliative Care, pp. 8-13, March/April 1995</ref>

== Dying ==
Patients, healthcare workers, and recently bereaved family members often describe a "good death" in terms of effective choices made in a few areas:<ref name="pmid10819707">{{cite journal |author=Steinhauser K, Clipp E, McNeilly M, Christakis N, McIntyre L, Tulsky J |title=In search of a good death: observations of patients, families, and providers |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=132 |issue=10 |pages=825–32 |date=16 May 2000|pmid=10819707 | url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/132/10/825 }}</ref>

* Assurance of effective pain and symptom management.
* Education about death and its aftermath, especially as it relates to decision-making.
* Completion of any significant goals, such as resolving past conflicts.

People who are terminally ill may not always follow recognizable [[Kübler-Ross model|stages of grief]].<ref name="titleTerminal illness: Interacting with a terminally ill loved one - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/grief/CA00041 |title=Terminal illness: Interacting with a terminally ill loved one - MayoClinic.com |accessdate=2008-02-09 |format= |work=}}</ref>  For example, a person who finds strength in [[denial]] may never reach a point of acceptance or accommodation and may react negatively to any statement that threatens this [[defense mechanism]].  Other people find comfort in arranging their financial and legal affairs or planning their [[funeral|funerals]].
