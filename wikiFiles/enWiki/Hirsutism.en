It refers to a male pattern of body hair ([[androgenic hair]]) and it is therefore primarily of [[Beauty|cosmetic]] and [[psychological]] concern. Hirsutism is a [[medical sign]] rather than a [[disease]] and may be a sign of a more serious medical condition, especially if it develops well after [[puberty]]. The amount and location of the hair is measured by a [[Ferriman-Gallwey score]].

== Signs and symptoms ==

[[File:Hirsutism-3.jpg|thumb|150px|left]]
Hirsutism affects women and sometimes men, since the rising of androgens causes a male pattern of body hair, sometimes excessive, particularly in locations where women normally do not develop terminal hair during [[puberty]] ([[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdomen]], back and [[facial hair|face]]). The medical term for excessive hair growth that affect both men and women is [[hypertrichosis]].

== Causes ==

Hirsutism can be caused by either an increased level of [[androgen]]s, the male [[hormone]]s, or an oversensitivity of [[hair follicle]]s to androgens. Male hormones such as [[testosterone]] stimulate hair growth, increase size and intensify the growth and pigmentation of hair. Other symptoms associated with a high level of male hormones include [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], deepening of the voice, and increased muscle mass.

Growing evidence implicates high circulating levels of [[insulin]] in women for the development of hirsutism. This theory is speculated to be consistent with the observation that obese (and thus presumably insulin resistant hyperinsulinemic) women are at high risk of becoming hirsute. Further, treatments that lower [[insulin]] levels will lead to a reduction in hirsutism.

It is speculated that insulin, at high enough concentration, stimulates the ovarian theca cells to produce androgens. There may also be an effect of high levels of insulin to activate [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) receptor in those same cells. Again, the result is increased androgen production.

Signs that are suggestive of an androgen-secreting tumor in a patient with hirsutism is rapid onset, [[virilization]] and palpable abdominal mass.

The following may be some of the conditions that may increase a woman's normally low level of male hormones:

* [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), the most common cause<ref name="pmid18844715">{{cite journal |author=Somani N, Harrison S, Bergfeld WF |title=The clinical evaluation of hirsutism |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=376–91 |year=2008 |pmid=18844715 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00219.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1396-0296&date=2008&volume=21&issue=5&spage=376}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
One method of evaluating hirsutism is the [[Ferriman-Gallwey score]] which gives a score based on the amount and location of hair growth on a woman.<ref name="pmid13892577">{{cite journal |author= Ferriman D, Gallwey JD |title=Clinical assessment of body hair growth in women |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=21 |issue= 11|pages=1440–7 |year=1961 |month=November |pmid=13892577 |doi= 10.1210/jcem-21-11-1440|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13892577}}</ref>

Diagnosis of patients with even mild hirsutism should include assessment of ovulation and ovarian [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] (because of the high prevalence of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]), as well as [[17-hydroxyprogesterone]] (because of the possibility of finding nonclassic [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|21-hydroxylase deficiency]]<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.056}}</ref>).

Other blood value that may be evaluated in the workup of hirsutism include:

* the [[androgen]]s [[testosterone]] and [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]]
* [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]]
* [[prolactin]]

If no underlying cause can be identified, the condition is considered [[idiopathic]].

== Treatment ==
Many women with unwanted hair seek methods of [[hair removal]]. However, the causes of the hair growth should be evaluated by a physician, who can conduct blood tests, pinpoint the specific origin of the abnormal hair growth, and advise on the treatment.

=== Pharmacological ===
Pharmacological treatments include:<ref name="pmid21623779"/>
* [[Spironolactone]]: Antialdosterone antiandrogenic compound.<ref name="pmid18389188">{{cite journal |author=Karakurt F |title=Comparison of the clinical efficacy of flutamide and spironolactone plus ethinyloestradiol/cyproterone acetate in the treatment of hirsutism: a randomised controlled study |journal=Adv Ther |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=321–8 |year=2008 |month=April |isbn=1232500800395{{Please check ISBN|reason=13 digit ISBN should start with  978 or 979.}} |pmid=18389188 |doi=10.1007/s12325-008-0039-5 |author-separator=, |author2=Sahin I |author3=Güler S |display-authors=3 |last4=Demirbas |first4=Berrin |last5=Culha |first5=Cavit |last6=Serter |first6=Rustu |last7=Aral |first7=Yalcin |last8=Bavbek |first8=Nuket}}</ref>
* [[Cyproterone acetate]]: A progestin that also has strong antiandrogenic action. In addition to single form, it is also available in some formulations of combined oral contraceptives.
* [[Finasteride]]: 5 alpha reductase inhibitor that inhibits conversion of testosterone to more active 5 alpha hydroxy testosterone
* [[Metformin]]: Antihyperglycemic drug used for diabetes mellitus. However, it is also effective in treatment of hirsutism associated with insulin resistance (e.g. [[polycystic ovary syndrome]])
* [[Eflornithine]]: Blocks [[putrescine]] that is necessary for the growth of hair follicles
* [[Flutamide]]: Androgen receptor antagonist.  The most effective treatment that was tested is the oral flutamide for one year.  Seventeen of eighteen women with hirsutism treated with combination therapy of flutamide 250&nbsp;mg twice daily and an oral contraceptive pill had a rapid and marked reduction in their hirsutism score. Amongst these, one woman with pattern hair loss showed remarkable improvement.{{Medical citation needed|date=July 2011}}
* Combination oral contraceptives

=== Other methods ===
* [[Epilation]]
* [[Waxing]]
* [[Shaving]]
* [[Laser hair removal]]

* Lifestyle change, including reducing excessive weight and addressing [[insulin resistance]], may be beneficial. Insulin resistance can cause excessive testosterone levels in women, resulting in hirsutism.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 7149493}}</ref> One study reported that women who stayed on a low calorie diet for at least six months lost weight and reduced Insulin Resistance. Their levels of [[Sex hormone-binding globulin]] ([[SHBG]]) increased, which reduced the amount of free testosterone in their blood. As expected, the women reported a reduction in the severity of their hirsutism and acne symptoms.
