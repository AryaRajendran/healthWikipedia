The '''World Congress of Cardiology''' is a regular meeting of cardiologists from across the world for the purpose of promoting research, training, and treatment of diseases of the heart.

==History==
The first World Congress of Cardiology was convened in Paris in September 1950 under the aegis of the International Society of Cardiology, which had itself been founded four years previously.  Subsequent congresses were held at four-year intervals until 2006; since then, they have been held at two-year intervals.<ref>http://www.world-heart-federation.org/about-us/history/ (accessed 28 April 2008).</ref>

In 1978 the International Society of Cardiology merged with the International Cardiology Federation (which had been founded in 1970) to form the International Society and Federation of Cardiology.  This body changed its name in 1998 to the World Heart Federation.  The World Congress of Cardiology is still a main, but not the only, activity of the World Heart Federation.

===List of Congresses===
A preliminary and somewhat informal international meeting of cardiologists was held in Prague in 1933, but the advent of Nazism and World War II prevented further international cooperation in the field until 1946, when a Cardiological Congress took place in Mexico City. The first true World Congress was held in 1950.<ref>Herman A. Snellen, "Birth and Growth of the European Society of Cardiology".  ''European Heart Journal'', vol. 1, no. 1, pp 5-7.</ref>
