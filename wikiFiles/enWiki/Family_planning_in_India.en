'''[[Family planning]] in India''' is based on efforts largely sponsored by the [[India]]n [[Government of India|government]]. In the 1965-2009 period, contraceptive usage has more than tripled (from 13% of married women in 1970 to 48% in 2009) and the fertility rate has more than halved (from 5.7 in 1966 to 2.6 in 2009), but the national fertility rate is still high enough to cause long-term population growth. India adds up to 10 [[lakh]] (1,000,000) people to its population every 15 days.<ref>{{cite book | author = Rabindra Nath Pati | title = Socio-cultural dimensions of reproductive child health | publisher = APH Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-81-7648-510-4  | page = 51 }}</ref><ref name="rengel2000">{{Citation | title=Encyclopedia of birth control | author=Marian Rengel | year=2000 | isbn=1-57356-255-6 | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dx1Kz-ezUjsC | quote=''...

==Contraceptive usage==
[[Image:Red Triangle.svg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Red Triangle, Family Planning|Red Triangle]] indicates family planning products and services in India]]
Low female literacy levels and the lack of widespread availability of birth-control methods is hampering the use of contraception in India.

Awareness of contraception is near-universal among married women in India.<ref name="iips2009gdj">{{Citation | title=Contraceptive use in India, 1992-93 |author=B.M. Ramesh, S.C. Gulati, R.D. Retherford | journal=National Family Health Survey Subject Reports, Number 2, October 1996 | publisher=International Institute for Population Sciences | accessdate=2009-11-25 | url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/3471/1/NFHSsubjrpt002.pdf}}</ref> However, the vast majority of married Indians (76% in a 2009 study) reported significant problems in accessing a choice of contraceptive methods.<ref name="who2009gdj">{{Citation | title=India and Family Planning: An Overview |author= | publisher=Department of Family and Community Health, World Health Organization | accessdate=2009-11-25 | url=http://www.searo.who.int/linkfiles/family_planning_fact_sheets_india.pdf}}</ref>

In 2009, 48.3% of married women were estimated to use a contraceptive method, i.e. more than half of all married women did not.<ref name="who2009gdj"/> About three-fourths of these were using female sterilization, which is by far the most prevalent birth-control method in India.<ref name="who2009gdj"/> Condoms, at a mere 3% were the next most prevalent method.<ref name="who2009gdj"/> Meghalaya, at 20%, had the lowest usage of contraception among all Indian states. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were the other two states that reported usage below 30%.<ref name="who2009gdj"/>

Comparative studies have indicated that increased female literacy is correlated strongly with a decline in fertility.<ref name="ewc1990gyq">{{Citation | title=How Female Literacy Affects Fertility: The Case of India |author= | publisher=Population Institute, East-West Center | date=December 1990 | accessdate=2009-11-25 | url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/p&p015.pdf}}</ref> Studies have indicated that female literacy levels are an independent strong predictor of the use of contraception, even when women do not otherwise have economic independence.<ref name="popstu1996gyq">{{Citation | title=Women's work, autonomy, and birth control: evidence from two south India villages |author=A.

===Family planning programmes===
The [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] is the government unit responsible for formulating and executing family planning related government plans in India. An inverted [[Red Triangle, Family Planning|Red Triangle]] is the symbol for [[family planning]] health and [[contraception]] services in India.

===Historical background===
[[Raghunath Dhondo Karve]] published a Marathi magazine Samaj Swasthya (समाजस्वास्थ्य)starting from July 1927 until 1953. In it, he continually discussed issues of society's well being through population control through use of contraceptives so as prevent unwanted pregnancies and induced abortions. He proposed that the Indian Government should take up a population control program, but was met with opposition.

In the early 1970s, [[Indira Gandhi]], Prime Minister of [[India]], had implemented a forced [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] programme, but failed. Officially, men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization, but many unmarried young men, political opponents and ignorant, poor men were also believed to have been sterilized. This program is still remembered and criticized in India, and is blamed for creating a public aversion to [[family planning]], which hampered Government programmes for decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Independent/Indira.html |title=Manas: History and Politics, Indira Gandhi |publisher=Sscnet.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>

Contraceptive usage has been rising gradually in India. In 1970, 13% of married women used modern contraceptive methods, which rose to 35% by 1997 and 48% by 2009.<ref name="rengel2000"/> The national family planning program was launched in 1951, and was the world's first governmental population stabilization program. By 1996, the program had been estimated to have averted 168 million births.<ref name="saxena1997sd">{{Citation | title=Reproductive Health in India | author=B.N.

The National Family Welfare Programme, established in India during the late 1950s, has averted about 168 million births since its inception ...''}}</ref>

==Fertility rate==
India suffers from the problem of [[overpopulation]].<ref>http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/environment/seniorsem03/Overpopulation_in_India.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027071002/http://geocities.com/soc2504groupproject/overpopulation_in_india_and_chin.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/may/11/population | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Over-population warning as India's billionth baby is born | date=2000-05-11 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Although the [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] (average number of children born per woman during her lifetime) in India has been declining, it has not reached replacement rate yet. The replacement rate is defined as the total fertility rate at which newborn girls would have an average of exactly one daughter over their lifetimes. In more familiar terms, women have just enough babies to replace themselves. Factoring in [[infant mortality]], the replacement rate is approximately 2.1 in most industrialized nations and about 2.5 in developing nations (due to higher mortality). Discounting immigration and [[population momentum]] effects, a nation that crosses below the replacement rate is on the path to population stabilization and, eventually, population reduction.

===Historical fertility trend===
The fertility rate in India has been in long-term decline, and had more than halved in the 1960-2009 period. From 5.7 in 1966, it declined to 3.3 by 1997 and 2.7 in 2009.<ref name="ramu2006">{{Citation | title=Brothers and sisters in India: a study of urban adult siblings |author=G.N. Ramu | publisher=University of Toronto Press | isbn=0-8020-9077-X | year=2006 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2cGSay9VxsgC}}</ref><ref name="bucen1997ahs">{{Citation | title=Population Trends: India |author=Arjun Adlakha | publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census | accessdate=2009-12-05 | date=April 1997 | url=http://www.census.gov/ipc/prod/ib-9701.pdf}}</ref>

===State and country comparisons===
Seven Indian states have dipped below the 2.1 replacement rate level and are no longer contributing to Indian population growth - [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Goa]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Kerala]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Sikkim]].<ref name="nfhsin2009ads">{{Citation | title=National Family Health Survey, India |author= | publisher= International Institute for Population Sciences | accessdate=2009-11-24 | url=http://www.nfhsindia.org/}}</ref> Four Indian states have fertility rates above 3.5 - [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Nagaland]].<ref name="nfhsin2009ads" /> Of these, [[Bihar]] has a fertility rate of 4.0, the highest of any Indian state. For detailed state figures and rankings, see [[Indian states ranking by fertility rate]].

In 2009, India had a lower estimated fertility rate than Pakistan and Bangladesh, but a higher fertility rate than China, Iran, Burma and Sri Lanka.<ref name="ciapop2009ads">{{Citation | title=Country Comparison: Total Fertility Rate, The World Factbook |author=CIA | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency | accessdate=2009-11-24 | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html}}</ref>
