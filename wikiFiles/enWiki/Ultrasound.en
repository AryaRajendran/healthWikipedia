[[File:Ultrasound range diagram.svg|thumb|425px|right|Approximate frequency ranges corresponding to ultrasound, with rough guide of some applications]]  
'''Ultrasound''' is  an oscillating [[sound]] pressure wave with a [[frequency]] greater than the upper limit of the human [[hearing range]]. Ultrasound is thus not separated from 'normal' (audible) sound based on differences in physical properties, only the fact that humans cannot hear it. Although this limit varies from person to person, it is approximately 20 [[Hertz|kilohertz]] (20,000 hertz) in healthy, young adults. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20&nbsp;kHz up to several gigahertz. 

Ultrasound is used in many different fields. Ultrasonic devices are used to detect objects and measure distances. Ultrasonic imaging ([[sonography]]) is used in both [[veterinary medicine]] and [[Medicine|human medicine]]. In the [[nondestructive testing]] of products and structures, ultrasound is used to detect invisible flaws. Industrially, ultrasound is used for cleaning and for mixing, and to accelerate chemical processes. Organisms such as [[bat]]s and [[porpoise]]s use ultrasound for locating [[Predation|prey]] and obstacles.<ref name="squires">{{cite book|author=Novelline, Robert|title=Squire's Fundamentals of Radiology|publisher=Harvard University Press|edition=5th|year=1997|isbn=0-674-83339-2|pages=34–35}}</ref>

'''Ultrasonics''' is the application of ultrasound. Ultrasound can be used for [[medical imaging]], detection, measurement and cleaning. At higher power levels, ultrasonics is useful for changing the chemical properties of substances.

== History ==

[[Acoustics]], the science of [[sound]], starts as far back as [[Pythagoras]] in the 6th century BC, who wrote on the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] properties of [[String instrument|stringed instruments]]. [[Sir Francis Galton]] constructed [[Dog whistle|a whistle]] producing ultrasound in 1893. The first technological application of ultrasound was an attempt to detect [[iceberg]]s by [[Paul Langevin]] in 1917. The [[piezoelectric effect]], discovered by [[Jacques Curie|Jacques]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1880, was useful in [[transducer]]s to generate and detect ultrasonic waves in air and water.<ref>Bruno Pollet ''Power Ultrasound in Electrochemistry: From Versatile Laboratory Tool to Engineering Solution'' John Wiley & Sons, 2012 ISBN 1119967864, chapter 1</ref> [[Animal echolocation|Echolocation]] in bats was discovered by [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] in 1794, when he demonstrated that bats hunted and navigated by inaudible sound and not vision.

== Perception in humans and animals ==

=== Humans ===
The upper frequency limit in humans (approximately 20&nbsp;kHz) is due to limitations of the [[middle ear]], which acts as a [[low-pass filter]]. [[Ultrasonic hearing]] can occur if ultrasound is fed directly into the [[human skull]] and reaches the [[cochlea]] through [[bone conduction]], without passing through the middle ear.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Corso |first=J. F. |year=1963 |title=Bone-conduction thresholds for sonic and ultrasonic frequencies |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=1738–1743 |doi=10.1121/1.1918804 |bibcode = 1963ASAJ...35.1738C }}</ref>

Children can hear some high-pitched sounds that older adults cannot hear, because in humans the upper limit pitch of hearing tends to decrease with age.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF00243505}}</ref> An American [[cell phone]] company has used this to create ring signals supposedly only able to be heard by younger humans;<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/12/technology/12ring.html?ex=1307764800&en=2a80d150770df0df&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss%3Cbr%20/%3E "A Ring Tone Meant to Fall on Deaf Ears"] (New York Times article)</ref> but many older people can hear the signals, which may be because of the considerable variation of age-related deterioration in the upper hearing threshold. [[The Mosquito]] is an electronic device that uses a high pitched frequency to deter [[loitering]] by young people.

=== Animals ===

[[File:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|thumb|Bats use ultrasounds to navigate in the darkness.]]
Bats use a variety of ultrasonic ranging ([[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]) techniques to detect their prey. They can detect frequencies beyond 100&nbsp;kHz, possibly up to 200&nbsp;kHz.<ref>Hearing by Bats (Springer Handbook of Auditory Research, vol. 5. Art Popper and Richard R. Fay (Editors). Springer, 1995</ref> 

Many insects have good ultrasonic hearing and most of these are [[nocturnal]] insects listening for [[Animal echolocation|echolocating]] [[bat]]s. This includes many groups of [[moth]]s, [[beetles]], [[praying mantid]]s and [[lacewings]].

All dogs can hear ultrasound. A [[dog whistle]] exploits this by emitting a high frequency sound to call to a dog. Many such whistles emit sound in the upper audible range of humans, but some, such as the [[silent whistle]], emit ultrasound at a frequency in the range 18–22&nbsp;kHz.

[[Toothed whales]], including [[dolphins]], can hear ultrasound and use such sounds in their navigational system ([[biosonar]]) to orient and capture prey.<ref>{{cite book|author=Whitlow W. L.

==Detection and ranging==

===Non-contact sensor===
An ultrasonic level or sensing system requires no contact with the target.  For many processes in the medical, pharmaceutical, military and general industries this is an advantage over inline sensors that may contaminate the liquids inside a vessel or tube or that may be clogged by the product.  

Both continuous wave and pulsed systems are used. The principle behind a pulsed-ultrasonic technology is that the transmit signal consists of short bursts of ultrasonic energy. After each burst, the electronics looks for a return signal within a small window of time corresponding to the time it takes for the energy to pass through the vessel. Only a signal received during this window will qualify for additional signal processing.

A popular consumer application of ultrasonic ranging was the [[Polaroid SX-70]] camera which included a light-weight transducer system to focus the camera automatically. Polaroid later licenced this ultrasound technology and it became the basis of a variety of ultrasonic products.

===Motion sensors and flow measurement===
A common ultrasound application is an automatic door opener, where an ultrasonic sensor detects a person's approach and opens the door. Ultrasonic sensors are also used to detect intruders; the ultrasound can cover a wide area from a single point. The flow in pipes or open channels can be measured by ultrasonic flowmeters, which measure the average velocity of flowing liquid.  In [[rheology]], an [[acoustic rheometer]] relies on the principle of ultrasound. In [[fluid mechanics]], fluid flow can be measured using an [[ultrasonic flow meter]].

===Non-destructive testing===
{{See also|Macrosonic|Ultrasonic testing}}
[[File:UT principe.svg|thumb|right| Principle of flaw detection with ultrasound. A void in the solid material reflects some energy back to the transducer, which is detected and displayed.]]

[[Ultrasonic testing]] is a type of [[nondestructive testing]] commonly used to find flaws in materials and to measure the thickness of objects. Frequencies of 2 to 10&nbsp;MHz are common but for special purposes other frequencies are used. Inspection may be manual or automated and is an essential part of modern manufacturing processes. Most [[metal]]s can be inspected as well as [[plastics]] and [[aerospace]] [[Composite material|composites]]. Lower frequency ultrasound (50–500&nbsp;kHz) can also be used to inspect less dense materials such as [[wood]], [[concrete]] and [[cement]].

Ultrasound inspection of welded joints has been an alternative to [[radiography]] for [[non-destructive testing]] since the 1960s.  Ultrasonic inspection eliminates the use of ionizing radiation, with safety and cost benefits. Ultrasound can also provide additional information such as the depth of flaws in a welded joint. Ultrasonic inspection has progressed from manual methods to computerized systems that automate much of the process. An ultrasonic test of a joint can identify the existence of flaws, measure their size, and identify their location.  Not all welded materials are equally amenable to ultrasonic inspection; some materials have a large grain size that produces a high level of background noise in measurements.<ref>K.H.J. Buschow et al, (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Materials'' Elsevier 2001 ISBN 0-08-043152-6 p. 5990</ref>

[[Ultrasonic thickness measurement]] is one technique used to monitor quality of welds.

===Ultrasonic range finding===
[[File:Sonar Principle EN.svg|thumb|400px|Principle of an active sonar]]
{{Main|sonar}}
A common use of ultrasound is in underwater [[range finding]]; this use is also called [[Sonar]]. An ultrasonic pulse is generated in a particular direction. If there is an object in the path of this pulse, part or all of the pulse will be reflected back to the transmitter as an [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and can be detected through the receiver path. By measuring the difference in time between the pulse being transmitted and the echo being received, it is possible to determine the distance.  

The measured travel time of Sonar pulses in water is strongly dependent on the temperature and the salinity of the water. Ultrasonic ranging is also applied for measurement in air and for short distances. For example hand-held ultrasonic measuring tools can rapidly measure the layout of rooms.

Although range finding underwater is performed at both sub-audible and audible frequencies for great distances (1 to several kilometers), ultrasonic range finding is used when distances are shorter and the accuracy of the distance measurement is desired to be finer. Ultrasonic measurements may be limited through barrier layers with large salinity, temperature or vortex differentials. Ranging in water varies from about hundreds to thousands of meters, but can be performed with centimeters to meters accuracy

===Ultrasound Identification (USID)===
[[Ultrasound Identification]] (USID) is a [[Real Time Locating]] System (RTLS) or [[Indoor Positioning System]] (IPS) technology used to automatically track and identify the location of objects in real time using simple, inexpensive nodes (badges/tags) attached to or embedded in objects and devices, which then transmit an ultrasound signal to communicate their location to microphone sensors.

==Imaging==

[[File:3dultrasound.png|thumb|right|Head of a fetus, aged 29 weeks, in a "[[4D Ultrasound|3D ultrasound]]"]]
The potential for ultrasonic imaging of objects, with a 3 GHZ sound wave producing resolution comparable to an optical image, was recognized by Sokolov in 1939 but techniques of the time produced relatively low-contrast images with poor sensitivity.<ref name=EPP99/>
Ultrasonic imaging uses frequencies of 2 megahertz and higher; the shorter wavelength allows resolution of small internal details in structures and tissues. The power density is generally less than 1 watt per square centimetre, to avoid heating and cavitation effects in the object under examination.<ref name=Betts00/> High and ultra high ultrasound waves are used in [[acoustic microscopy]], with frequencies up to 4 gigahertz. Ultrasonic imaging applications include industrial non-destructive testing, quality control and medical uses.<ref name=EPP99>Emmanuel P. Papadakis (ed) ''Ultrasonic Instruments & Devices'', Academic Press, 1999 ISBN 0-12-531951-7   page 752</ref>

==Acoustic microscopy==
[[Acoustic microscopy]] is the technique of using sound waves to visualize structures too small to be resolved by the human eye. Frequencies up to several gigahertz are used in acoustic microscopes.  The reflection and diffraction of sound waves from microscopic structures can yield information not available with light.

===Human medicine===
{{See also|Medical ultrasonography}}
'''Medical sonography''' ('''ultrasonography''') is an ultrasound-based diagnostic [[medical imaging]] technique used to visualize muscles, tendons, and many internal organs, to capture their size, structure and any pathological [[lesion]]s with real time tomographic images. Ultrasound has been used by [[radiologists]] and [[sonographer]]s to image the human body for at least 50 years and has become a widely used diagnostic tool. The technology is relatively inexpensive and portable, especially when compared with other techniques, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[computed tomography]] (CT). Ultrasound is also used to visualize fetuses during routine and emergency [[prenatal care]]. Such diagnostic applications used during [[pregnancy]] are referred to as [[Obstetric ultrasonography|obstetric sonography]]. As currently applied in the medical field, properly performed ultrasound poses no known risks to the patient.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1148/rg.234035034|title=Physics Tutorial for Residents: Topics in US: B-mode US: Basic Concepts and New Technology – Hangiandreou|volume=23|issue=4|page=1019|year=2003|last1=Hangiandreou|first1=N.

Ultrasound is also increasingly being used in trauma and first aid cases, with [[emergency ultrasound]] becoming a staple of most EMT response teams. Furthermore, ultrasound is used in remote diagnosis cases where [[teleconsultation]] is required, such as scientific experiments in space or mobile sports team diagnosis.<ref>[http://www.epiphan.com/solutions_new/?arid=1082 DistanceDoc and MedRecorder: New Approach to Remote Ultrasound Imaging | Solutions | Epiphan Systems].

Ultrasound technology provides a means for cattle producers to obtain information that can be used to improve the breeding and husbandry of cattle. The technology can be expensive, and it requires a substantial time commitment for continuous data collection and operator training.<ref name=WVUWagner /> Nevertheless, this technology has proven useful in managing and running a cattle breeding operation.<ref name=SubiacoDeltaFarm />

==Processing and power==
High-power applications of ultrasound often use frequencies between 20&nbsp;kHz and a few hundred Khz. Power densities can be very high; above 10 watts/square centimeter, cavitation can be inducted in liquid media, and some applications use up to 1000 watts per square centimeter.  Such high power levels can induce chemical changes or produce significant effects by direct mechanical action, and can inactivate harmful microrganisms.<ref name=Betts00>Gail D Betts et al, ''Inactivation of Food-borne Microrganisms using Power Ultrasound'' in ''Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology'', Academic Press, 2000 ISBN 0-12-227070-3 page 2202</ref>

===Biomedical applications===
{{main|therapeutic ultrasound }}
Ultrasound also has therapeutic applications, which can be highly beneficial when used with dosage precautions<ref>''Essentials of Medical Ultrasound: A Practical Introduction to the Principles, Techniques and Biomedical Applications'', edited by M. H. Rapacholi, Humana Press 1982</ref> Relatively high power ultrasound can break up stony deposits or tissue, accelerate the effect of drugs in a targeted area, assist in the measurement of the elastic properties of tissue, and can be used to sort cells or small particles for research.

===Ultrasonic Impact Treatment===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
[[Ultrasonic impact treatment]] (UIT) uses ultrasound to enhance the mechanical and physical properties of metals. It is a metallurgical processing technique in which ultrasonic energy is applied to a metal object. Ultrasonic treatment can result in controlled residual compressive stress, grain refinement and grain size reduction. Low and high cycle fatigue are enhanced and have been documented to provide increases up to ten times greater than non-UIT specimens. Additionally, UIT has proven effective in addressing [[stress corrosion cracking]], [[corrosion fatigue]] and related issues. 

When the UIT tool, made up of the ultrasonic transducer, pins and other components, comes into contact with the work piece it acoustically couples with the work piece, creating harmonic resonance.<ref>{{cite web|title=UIT Solutions Video|url=http://www.appliedultrasonics.com/solutions_video.html|work=appliedultrasonics.com|accessdate=28 September 2012}}</ref> This harmonic resonance is performed at a carefully calibrated frequency, to which metals respond very favorably.

Depending on the desired effects of treatment a combination of different frequencies and displacement amplitude is applied. These frequencies range between 25 and 55&nbsp;kHz,<ref>{{cite web|title=Tools of the Trade|url=http://appliedultrasonics.com/solutions.html|work=appliedultrasonics.com|accessdate=28 September 2012}}</ref> with the displacement amplitude of the resonant body of between 22 and 50&nbsp;µm (0.00087 and 0.0020 in).

UIT devices rely on [[magnetostrictive]] transducers.

===Processing===
{{main|Sonication}}
Ultrasonication offers great potential in the processing of liquids and slurries, by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various applications and industries. Ultrasonication generates alternating low-pressure and high-pressure waves in liquids, leading to the formation and violent collapse of small [[vacuum]] bubbles. This phenomenon is termed [[cavitation]] and causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear-forces. These effects are used for the deagglomeration and milling of micrometre and nanometre-size materials as well as for the disintegration of cells or the mixing of reactants. In this aspect, ultrasonication is an alternative to high-speed mixers and agitator bead mills. Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to distribute the cellulose fibres more uniform in the produced paper web, which will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces. Furthermore, chemical reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers. For many processes, this sonochemical (see [[sonochemistry]]) effect leads to a substantial reduction in the reaction time, like in the [[transesterification]] of oil into [[biodiesel]].
Ultrasonication can easily be tested in lab scale for its effect on various liquid formulations. Equipment manufacturers have developed a number of larger ultrasonic processors of up to 16&nbsp;kW power.<ref>http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonics/industry.htm</ref> Therefore volumes from 1mL up to several hundred gallons per minute can be sonicated today in order to achieve all kinds of results from the link that is shown below.

===Ultrasonic manipulation and characterization of particles===
A researcher at the Industrial Materials Research Institute, Alessandro Malutta, devised an experiment that demonstrated the trapping action of ultrasonic standing waves on wood pulp fibers diluted in water and their parallel orienting into the equidistant pressure planes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dion |first=J. L. |last2=Malutta |first2=A. |last3=Cielo |first3=P. |title=Ultrasonic inspection of fiber suspensions |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=72 |issue=5 |year=1982 |pages=1524–1526 |doi=10.1121/1.388688 |bibcode = 1982ASAJ...72.1524D }}</ref> The time to orient the fibers in equidistant planes is measured with a laser and an electro-optical sensor. This could provide the paper industry a quick on-line fiber size measurement system. A somewhat different implementation was demonstrated at Pennsylvania State University using a microchip which generated a pair of perpendicular standing surface acoustic waves allowing to position particles equidistant to each other on a grid. This experiment, called "acoustic tweezers", can be used for applications in material sciences, biology, physics, chemistry and nanotechnology.

===Ultrasonic cleaning===
{{Main|Ultrasonic cleaning}}

[[Ultrasonic cleaner]]s, sometimes mistakenly called ''[[supersonic]] cleaners'', are used at frequencies from 20 to 40 [[Hertz|kHz]] for [[jewellery]], [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and other optical parts, [[watch]]es, [[dentistry|dental instrument]]s, [[surgical instrument]]s, [[diving regulator]]s and [[Industry|industrial]] parts. An ultrasonic cleaner works mostly by energy released from the collapse of millions of microscopic [[cavitation]]s near the dirty surface. The bubbles made by cavitation collapse forming tiny jets directed at the surface.

===Ultrasonic disintegration===
Similar to ultrasonic cleaning, [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s including [[bacteria]] can be disintegrated. High power ultrasound produces [[cavitation]] that facilitates particle disintegration or reactions. This has uses in [[Biology|biological science]] for analytical or chemical purposes ([[sonication]] and [[sonoporation]]) and in killing bacteria in [[sewage]]. High power ultrasound can disintegrate corn slurry and enhance liquefaction and saccharification for higher ethanol yield in dry corn milling plants.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/ws/00606/ws006060035.htm|title=Ultrasound pre-treatment of waste activated sludge|doi=10.2166/ws.2006.962|year=2006|last1=(Hans) Van Leeuwen|first1=J|last2=Akin|last3=Khanal|last4=Sung|last5=Grewell|last6=(Hans) Van Leeuwen|journal=Water Science & Technology: Water Supply|volume=6|page=35|first2=Beril|first3=Samir Kumar|first4=Shihwu|first5=David|first6=J|issue=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/wst/04209/wst042090073.htm|title=Enhancement of anaerobic sludge digestion by ultrasonic disintegration|author=U Neis, K Nickel and A Tiehm|journal=Water Science & Technology|volume=42|issue=9|page=73|year=2000}}</ref>

===Ultrasonic humidifier===
The ultrasonic humidifier, one type of [[nebulizer]] (a device that creates a very fine spray), is a popular type of humidifier. It works by vibrating a metal plate at ultrasonic frequencies to nebulize (sometimes incorrectly called "atomize") the water. Because the water is not heated for evaporation, it produces a cool mist. The ultrasonic pressure waves nebulize not only the water but also materials in the water including calcium, other minerals, viruses, fungi, bacteria,<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1488018|title=Microbial contamination by ultrasonic humidifier|year=1992|last1=Oie|first1=S|last2=Masumoto|last3=Hironaga|last4=Koshiro|last5=Kamiya|volume=72|issue=292–293|pages=161–6|journal=Microbios|first2=N|first3=K|first4=A|first5=A}}</ref> and other impurities. Illness caused by impurities that reside in a humidifier's reservoir fall under the heading of "Humidifier Fever".

Ultrasonic humidifiers are frequently used in [[aeroponics]], where they are generally referred to as [[fogger]]s.

===Ultrasonic welding===
In [[ultrasonic welding]] of plastics, high frequency (15&nbsp;kHz to 40&nbsp;kHz ) low amplitude vibration is used to create heat by way of friction between the materials to be joined. The interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the energy for the maximum weld strength.

===Sonochemistry===
{{Main|Sonochemistry}}
Power ultrasound in the 20–100&nbsp;kHz range is used in [[chemistry]]. The ultrasound does not interact directly with [[molecule]]s to induce the chemical change, as its typical wavelength (in the millimeter range) is too long compared to the molecules. Instead, the energy causes [[cavitation]] which generates  extremes of temperature and pressure in the liquid where the reaction happens. Ultrasound also breaks up solids and removes [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] layers of [[inert]] material to give a larger [[surface area]] for the reaction to occur over. Both of these effects make the reaction faster. In 2008, [[Atul Kumar]] reported synthesis of Hantzsch esters and polyhydroquinoline derivatives via multi-component reaction protocol in aqueous [[micelles]] using ultrasound.<ref>Kumar, Atul, Ram Awatar Maurya. [http://www.organic-chemistry.org/abstracts/lit2/076.shtm Efficient Synthesis of Hantzsch Esters and Polyhydroquinoline Derivatives in Aqueous Micelles]. ''Synlett'' 2008. pp 883–885.</ref>

Ultrasound is used in [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]], using different frequencies.

===Weapons===
Ultrasound has been studied as a basis for [[sonic weapon]]s, for applications such as riot control, disorientation of attackers, up to lethal levels of sound.

==Other uses==
Ultrasound when applied in specific configurations can produce short bursts of light in an exotic phenomenon known as [[sonoluminescence]]. This phenomenon is being investigated partly because of the possibility of [[bubble fusion]] (a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction hypothesized to occur during sonoluminescence).

Ultrasound is used when characterizing particulates through the technique of [[ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy]] or by observing [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

Audio can be propagated by [[modulated ultrasound]].

A formerly popular consumer application of ultrasound was in television [[remote control]]s for adjusting volume and changing channels. Introduced by [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] in the late 1950s, the system used a hand-held remote control containing short rod resonators struck by small hammers, and a microphone on the set. Filters and detectors discriminated between the various operations. The principal advantages were that no battery was needed in the hand-held control box, and unlike radio waves, the ultrasound was unlikely to affect neighboring sets. Ultrasound remained in use until displaced by infrared systems starting in the late 1980s.<ref>Jeremy G. Butler, ''Television: Critical Methods and Applications'', Routledge, 2006 ISBN 0805854150 page 276</ref>

==Nonlinear propagation effects==
Because of their high amplitude to wavelength ratio, ultrasonic waves commonly display [[Nonlinear acoustics|nonlinear propagation]].

==Safety==
Occupational exposure to ultrasound in excess of 120 dB may lead to hearing loss. Exposure in excess of 155 dB may produce heating effects that are harmful to the human body, and it has been calculated that exposures above 180 dB may lead to death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guidelines for the Safe Use of Ultrasound Part II – Industrial & Commercial Applications – Safety Code 24|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php#a2.2|isbn=0-660-13741-0|year=1991|publisher=Health Canada|author=Part II, industrial and commercial applications}}</ref> The UK's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) produced a report in 2010, which was published by the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA). This report recommended an exposure limit for the general public to airborne ultrasound sound pressure levels (SPL) of 70 dB (at 20&nbsp;kHz), and 100 dB (at 25&nbsp;kHz and above).<ref>{{cite book|title=Health Effects of Exposure to Ultrasound and Infrasound|year=2010|publisher=Health Protection Agency, UK.|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1265028759369|author=AGNIR|pages=167–170}}</ref>
