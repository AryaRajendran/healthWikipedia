==Governmental controls to prevent outbreaks==

===Regulations and ordinances===
The guidance issued by the UK government's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) now recommends that microbiological monitoring for wet cooling systems, using a [[dipslide]], should be performed weekly. The guidance now also recommends that routine testing for legionella bacteria in wet cooling systems be carried out at least quarterly, and more frequently when a system is being commissioned, or if the bacteria have been identified on a previous occasion.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/lau/lacs/46-2.htm#para8 UK: Health and Safety Executive Microbiological monitoring (weekly dip slide)]</ref>
Further non-statutory UK guidance from the Water Regulations Advisory Scheme now exists for pre-heating of water in applications such as solar water heating systems.<ref>http://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf</ref>

The City of [[Garland, Texas]] requires yearly testing for legionella bacteria at cooling towers at apartment buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-legionella_01eas.ART0.East.Edition1.29739cd.html |title=The Dallas Morning News, Garland tough on bacteria |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

[[Malta]] requires twice yearly testing for ''Legionella'' bacteria at cooling towers and water fountains. [[Malta]] prohibits the installation of new cooling towers and evaporative condensers at health care facilities and schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov.mt/EN/legalnotices/2006/01/LN5.pdf |title=299601 Legionella |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

The Texas Department of State Health Services has provided guidelines for hospitals to detect and prevent the spread of [[nosocomial infection]] due to legionella.<ref>Report of the Texas Legionnaires' Disease Task Force, Texas Department of State Health Services</ref>
The [[European Working Group for Legionella Infections]] (EWGLI)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewgli.org |title=European Working Group for '&#39;Legionella'&#39; Infections |publisher=Ewgli.org |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> was established in 1986 within the [[European Union]] framework to share knowledge and experience about potential sources of ''Legionella'' and their control. This group has published guidelines<ref>www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1274093149925</ref> about the actions to be taken to limit the number of colony forming units (i.e., the "aerobic count") of micro-organisms per mL at 30 °C (minimum 48 hours incubation):

{| class="wikitable"

Almost all natural water sources contain ''Legionella'' and their presence should not be taken as an indication of a problem. The tabled figures are for total aerobic plate count, cfu/ml at 30 °C (minimum 48 hours incubation) with colony count determined by the pour plate method according to ISO 6222(21) or spread plate method on yeast extract agar. Legionella isolation can be conducted using the method developed by the US Center for Disease Control using buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with antibiotics.

Many other governmental agencies, cooling tower manufacturers, and industrial trade organizations have developed design and maintenance guidelines for preventing or controlling the growth of ''Legionella'' in cooling towers. However, in the US, there are no regulations requiring testing or maintaining any specified levels in these facilities.

===Eliminating breeding grounds===
The bacteria grow best in warm water, like the kind found in hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems, or parts of the air-conditioning systems of large buildings. Indoor ornamental fountains have been confirmed as a cause of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks, in which submerged lighting as a heat source was attributed to the outbreak in all documented cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Controlling the growth of ''Legionella'' in ornamental fountains is touched on in many of the listed guidelines. However, specific guidelines for solar water heating systems <ref>http://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdfornamental fountains have also been published.</ref>

Adding an [[antibacterial agent]] to the automobiles' windshield system's reservoir is also recommended Legionellae have been discovered in up to 40% of freshwater environments and have been in up to 80% of freshwater sites by PCR hybridization assay.

''Legionella'' bacteria themselves can be inactivated by [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light. However, ''Legionella'' bacteria that grow and reproduce in [[amoeba]]e or that are sheltered in corrosion particles cannot be killed by UV light alone. 

''Legionella'' will grow in water at temperatures from {{convert|20|to|50|C|F}}. However, the bacteria reproduce at the greatest rate in [[stagnant water]] at temperatures of {{convert|35|to|46|C|F}}.

Copper-Silver ionization is an effective industrial control and prevention process to eradicate ''Legionella'' in potable water distribution systems and cooling towers found in health facilities, hotels, nursing homes and most large buildings. In 2003, ionization became the first such hospital disinfection process to have fulfilled a proposed four-step modality evaluation; by then it had been adopted by over 100 hospitals.<ref name=iche>{{harvnb|Stout|Yu|2003}} "(1) Demonstrated efficacy of ''Legionella'' eradication in vitro using laboratory assays, (2) anecdotal experiences in preventing legionnaires' disease in individual hospitals, (3) controlled studies in individual hospitals, and (4) validation in confirmatory reports from multiple hospitals during a prolonged time."</ref> Additional studies indicate ionization is superior to thermal eradication.{{sfn|Block|2001}}

A 2011 study by Lin, Stout and Yu {{sfn|Lin, Stout & Yu|2011}}[http://www.legionella.org/LinStoutYu2011ICHE.pdf] found Copper-Silver ionization to be the only Legionella control technology which has been validated through a 4 step scientific approach.

A recent research study provided evidence that ''Legionella pneumophila'', the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, can travel airborne at least 6&nbsp;km from its source. In 2000, ASHRAE issued guidelines to maintain water systems and to decrease the chances of Legionnaires' disease transmission. The guidelines were not valued because legionella multiply in such temperatures. On the other hand, a lot of states had regulations that limited temperatures in health care facilities in order to reduce scalding injuries.

It was previously believed that transmission of the bacterium was restricted to much shorter distances. A team of French scientists reviewed the details of an epidemic of Legionnaires' disease that took place in [[Pas-de-Calais]] in northern France in 2003–2004. There were 86 confirmed cases during the outbreak, of whom 18 died. The source of infection was identified as a cooling tower in a [[petrochemical]] plant, and an analysis of those affected in the outbreak revealed that some infected people lived as far as 6–7&nbsp;km from the plant.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Long-range transmission of Legionella |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=4 |pages=171–2 |date=March 2006 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1368 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v4/n3/full/nrmicro1368.html |issue=3}}</ref>

A study of Legionnaires' disease cases in May 2005 in [[Sarpsborg]], [[Norway]] concluded that: "The high velocity, large drift, and high humidity in the air scrubber may have contributed to the wide spread of ''Legionella'' species, probably for >10 km. "...<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nygård K, Werner-Johansen Ø, Rønsen S, ''et al.'' |title=An outbreak of legionnaires disease caused by long-distance spread from an industrial air scrubber in Sarpsborg, Norway |journal=Clin.

In 2010 a study by the UK [[Health Protection Agency]] reported that 20% of cases may be caused by infected windscreen washer systems filled with pure water. The finding came after researchers spotted that professional drivers are five times more likely to contract the disease. No cases of infected systems were found whenever a suitable [[Windshield washer fluid|washer fluid]] was used.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilkinson |first=Emma |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/10293519.stm |title=Windscreen water infection risk |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-06-13 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>
