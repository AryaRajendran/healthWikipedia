A '''latrotoxin''' is a high-molecular mass [[neurotoxin]] found in the venom of [[spider]]s of the genus ''[[Latrodectus]]'' (widow spiders). Latrotoxins are the main active components of the venom and are responsible for the symptoms of [[latrodectism]]. 

The following latrotoxins have been described: five insecticidal toxins, termed α, β, γ, δ and ε-latroinsectotoxins, one vertebrate-specific neurotoxin, [[alpha-latrotoxin]], and one toxin affecting crustaceans, α-latrocrustatoxin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grishin EV |title=Black widow spider toxins: the present and the future |journal=Toxicon |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1693–701 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9792186 |doi= 10.1016/S0041-0101(98)00162-7|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0041-0101(98)00162-7}}</ref>

==α-Latrotoxin==
{{Main|alpha-Latrotoxin}}
The best-studied latrotoxin is [[alpha-latrotoxin]], which acts presynaptically to release [[neurotransmitters]] (including [[acetylcholine]]) from sensory and motor neurons, as well as on endocrine cells (to release [[insulin]], for example).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Südhof TC |title=alpha-Latrotoxin and its receptors: neurexins and CIRL/latrophilins |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=24 |issue= |pages=933–62 |year=2001 |pmid=11520923 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.933 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.933?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref> It is a ~130 kDa [[protein]] which exists mainly in its dimerized or tetramerized forms.

==Latroinsectotoxins==
The natural prey of widow spiders are insects, and several insectotoxins are found in its venom.  The latroinsectotoxins appear to have similar structures.<ref name="pmid17210168">{{cite journal |author=Rohou A, Nield J, Ushkaryov YA |title=Insecticidal toxins from black widow spider venom |journal=Toxicon |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=531–49 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17210168 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2006.11.021 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0041-0101(06)00432-6 |pmc=2517654}}</ref>

==Other venom components==
Apart from the high molecular weight latrotoxins described above, ''Latrodectus'' venom also contains low molecular weight proteins<ref name="pmid8051061">{{cite journal |author=Gasparini S, Kiyatkin N, Drevet P, ''et al.'' |title=The low molecular weight protein which co-purifies with alpha-latrotoxin is structurally related to crustacean hyperglycemic hormones |journal=J.
