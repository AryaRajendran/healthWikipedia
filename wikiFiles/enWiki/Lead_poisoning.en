<!-- DEFINITION, SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, COMPLICATIONS -->
'''Lead poisoning''' (also known as '''plumbism''', '''colica Pictonum''', '''saturnism''', [[Devon colic]], or '''painter's colic''') is a medical condition in humans and other [[vertebrate]]s caused by increased levels of the [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] [[lead]] in the body. Lead interferes with a variety of body processes and is toxic to many organs and tissues including the [[cardiovascular|heart]], [[bone]]s, [[intestine]]s, [[kidney]]s, and [[reproductive system|reproductive]] and [[nervous system|nervous]] systems. It interferes with the development of the nervous system and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent [[learning disorder|learning]] and behavior disorders. Symptoms include abdominal pain, [[confusion]], headache, [[anemia]], irritability, and in severe cases [[seizure]]s, [[coma]], and [[death]].

<!-- EXPOSURE ROUTES, PREVENTION, EPIDEMIOLOGY -->
Routes of exposure to lead include contaminated air, water, soil, food, and consumer products.<!--<ref name="Dart041423">[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] p. 1423</ref>--> Occupational exposure is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults. According to estimates made by the [[National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), more than 3 million workers in the [[United States]] are potentially exposed to lead in the workplace.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Staudinger KC, Roth VS |title=Occupational lead poisoning |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=719–26, 731–2 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9490995 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/0215/p719.html}}</ref> One of the largest threats to children is [[lead paint]] that exists in many homes, especially older ones; thus children in older housing with chipping paint or lead dust from moveable window frames with lead paint are at greater risk. Prevention of lead exposure can range from individual efforts (e.g. removing lead-containing items such as piping or blinds from the home) to nationwide policies (e.g. laws that ban lead in products, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, or provide for cleanup and mitigation of contaminated soil, etc.).

<!-- Dx and treatment  -->
Elevated lead in the body can be detected by the presence of changes in blood cells visible with a microscope and dense lines in the bones of children seen on X-ray. However, the main tool for diagnosis is measurement of the [[blood lead level]] or a urine test. When [[blood lead levels]] are recorded, the results indicate how much lead is circulating within the [[blood stream]], not the amount being stored in the body.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/hwtr/demodebris/pages2/lbloodtest.html Blood Lead Level Testing], Department of Ecology State of Washington. 2011</ref> There are two units for reporting [[blood lead level]], either micrograms per deciliter (µg/dl), or micrograms per 100&nbsp;grams (µg/100 g) of whole blood, which are numerically equivalent. The [[Centers for Disease Control]] (US) has set the standard elevated blood lead level for adults to be 25 (µg/dl) of the whole blood. For children however, the number is set much lower at 5 (µg/dl) of blood as of 2012<ref name=CDC2012>{{cite web|title=Advisory Committee On Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP)|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/acclpp_main.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=18 May 2012|month=May|year=2012}}</ref> down from a previous 10 (µg/dl).<ref name="cdc.gov">{{cite web|title=Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary Prevention|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/Final_Document_010412.pdf|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Children are especially prone to the health effects of lead and as a result, blood lead levels must be set lower and closely monitored if contamination is possible.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and [[chelation therapy]] (administration of agents that bind lead so it can be [[excretion|excreted]]).

<!-- HISTORY -->
Humans have been mining and using this heavy metal for thousands of years, poisoning themselves in the process. Although lead poisoning is one of the oldest known work and environmental hazards,<!--<ref name="Flora08"/> --> the modern understanding of the small amount of lead necessary to cause harm did not come about until the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. No safe threshold for lead exposure has been discovered—that is, there is no known amount of lead that is too small to cause the body harm.<!--<ref name="Merrill07861"/><ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/>-->

==Classification==
<!-- DEFINITIONS -->
Classically, "lead poisoning" or "lead intoxication" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects.<ref name="Grant09-785">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 785</ref> Poisoning is a pattern of symptoms that occur with toxic effects from mid to high levels of exposure; toxicity is a wider spectrum of effects, including [[subclinical]] ones (those that do not cause symptoms).<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin">{{cite journal|last1=Guidotti|first1=TL|last2=Ragain|first2=L|title=Protecting children from toxic exposure: three strategies|journal=Pediatric clinics of North America|volume=54|issue=2|pages=227–35, vii|year=2007|pmid=17448358|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.002}}</ref> However, professionals often use "lead poisoning" and "lead toxicity" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of "lead poisoning" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead.<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/>

The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity.<ref name="Pearson03"/>
<!-- ACUTE VS. CHRONIC -->
Lead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common.<ref name="Trevor07-479">[[#CITEREFTrevor07|Trevor, Katzung, Masters (2007)]] p. 479</ref>
<!-- BLOOD LEVELS -->
Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in [[microgram]]s of lead per [[deciliter]] of blood (μg/dL). The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]] state that a blood lead level of 10&nbsp;μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level.<ref name="Rossi09"/><ref name="Barbosa">{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa Jr|first1=F|last2=Tanus-Santos|first2=JE|last3=Gerlach|first3=RF|last4=Parsons|first4=PJ|title=A Critical Review of Biomarkers Used for Monitoring Human Exposure to Lead: Advantages, Limitations, and Future Needs|journal=Environmental health perspectives|volume=113|issue=12|pages=1669–74|year=2005|pmid=16330345|pmc=1314903|doi=10.1289/ehp.7917}}</ref> Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Ragan09-JAAPA"/>

<!-- ORGANIC VS. INORGANIC -->
Lead forms a variety of compounds and exists in the environment in various forms.<ref name="Grant09-761">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 761</ref> Features of poisoning differ depending on whether the agent is an [[organic compound]] (one that contains carbon), or an [[inorganic]] one.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic [[gasoline#Lead|lead compounds as gasoline additives]], but such compounds are still used in industrial settings.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the [[central nervous system]] predominantly.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>

==Signs and symptoms==

<!-- ABOUT S/S -->
Lead poisoning can cause a variety of [[symptom]]s and [[medical sign|signs]] which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure.<ref name="Karri08"/><ref name="Kosnett05-825"/> Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms.<ref name="Mycyk05-463"/> Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.<ref name="Dart041426"/>
<!-- ORGANIC LEAD -->
Symptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly.<ref name="Timbrell08">{{cite book |title= Principles of Biochemical Toxicology |edition=4th |chapter=Biochemical mechanisms of toxicity: Specific examples |editor= Timbrell, J.A. |year= 2008 |publisher=Informa Health Care |isbn= 0-8493-7302-6|ref=}}</ref> Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as [[insomnia]], [[delirium]], [[cognitive deficit]]s, [[tremor]], hallucinations, and convulsions.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>

<!--
CHILDREN V. ADULTS-->
Symptoms may be different in adults and children; the main symptoms in adults are headache, [[abdominal pain]], [[memory loss]], [[kidney failure]], male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol">{{cite journal|last1=Pearce|first1=JM|title=Burton's line in lead poisoning|journal=European neurology|volume=57|issue=2|pages=118–9|year=2007|pmid=17179719|doi=10.1159/000098100}}</ref>

Early symptoms of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and [[myalgia|muscle pain]].<ref name="Merrill07"/> Other early signs in adults include [[malaise]], fatigue, decreased [[libido]], and problems with sleep.<ref name="Karri08"/> An unusual taste in the mouth and personality changes are also early signs.<ref name="Patrick06"/>

In adults, symptoms can occur at levels above 40&nbsp;μg/dL, but are more likely to occur only above 50–60&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Karri08"/> Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Needleman04-AnnRev">{{cite journal|last1=Needleman|first1=H|title=Lead poisoning|journal=Annual review of medicine|volume=55|pages=209–22|year=2004|pmid=14746518|doi=10.1146/annurev.med.55.091902.103653}}</ref> However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual.<ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/> At blood lead levels between 25 and 60&nbsp;μg/dL, [[neuropsychiatric]] effects such as delayed [[reaction time]]s, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed [[motor nerve]] conduction and headache can occur.<ref name="Kosnett06-240">[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] p.240</ref> [[Anemia]] may appear at blood lead levels higher than 50&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Merrill07"/> In adults, Abdominal [[colic]], involving [[Paroxysmal attack|paroxysm]]s of pain, may appear at blood lead levels greater than 80&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Kosnett05-825">[[#CITEREFKosnett05|Kosnett (2005)]] p. 825</ref> Signs that occur in adults at blood lead levels exceeding 100&nbsp;μg/dL include [[wrist drop]] and [[foot drop]], <!-- because of neuropathy --> and signs of [[encephalopathy]] (a condition characterized by [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]]), such as those that accompany increased [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]], [[delirium]], coma, [[seizures]], and [[headache]].<ref name="Henretig061314">[[#CITEREFHenretig06|Henretig (2006)]] p. 1314</ref> In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at lead levels exceeding 70&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Henretig061314"/> For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Kosnett05-825"/>

===Acute poisoning===
In acute poisoning, typical neurological signs are pain, muscle weakness, [[paraesthesia]], and, rarely, symptoms associated with [[encephalitis]].<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Lead's effects on the mouth include [[astringent|astringency]] and a metallic taste.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> [[Gastrointestinal]] problems, such as [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[poor appetite]], or [[weight loss]], are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause [[shock (medical)|shock]] (insufficient fluid in the [[circulatory system]]) due to loss of water from the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> [[Hemolysis]] (the rupture of [[red blood cells]]) due to acute poisoning can cause [[anemia]] and [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]].<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as [[oliguria|decreased urine output]].<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/>

===Chronic poisoning===
Chronic poisoning usually presents with symptoms affecting multiple systems,<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> but is associated with three main types of symptoms: [[gastrointestinal]], [[neuromuscular]], and [[neurological]].<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> [[Central nervous system]] and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Signs of chronic exposure include loss of [[short-term memory]] or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities.<ref name="Patrick06"/> Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> A "lead hue" of the skin with [[pallor]] is another feature<!--of chronic lead poisoning-->.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

===Hunting===
Because game animals can be shot using lead bullets, the potential for consumption of game meat to represent an avenue for lead ingestion has seen clinical and epidemiological study. In a recent study conducted by the CDC,<ref name=Iqbal2009>{{cite journal|last=Iqbal|first=Shahed|coauthors=Blumenthal W, Kennedy C, Yip FY, Pickard S, Flanders WD, Loringer K, Kruger K, Caldwell KL, Jean Brown M.|title=Hunting with lead: association between blood lead levels and wild game consumption|journal=Environ Res|date=10|year=2009|volume=109|issue=8|pages=952–959|pmid=19747676|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2009.08.007|bibcode = 2009ER....109..952I }}</ref> a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).

This study has been cited by popular media as simple evidence that hunting increases exposure to lead poisoning, prompting the University of Illinois Extension to release a statement that there is no such risk.<ref>{{cite news |title =No Danger of Lead Poisoning from Meat Obtained by Hunting

Some hunters{{who|date=January 2013}} may argue that lead-based bullets offer greater accuracy and more humane kills of game animals than might copper-based bullets, which represent the most commonly available, though expensive, alternative to lead. Bullet designs vary greatly, and some lead-based bullets are highly resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with negligible risk of including lead fragments in prepared meat. Other bullets are prone to fragmentation and exacerbate the risk of lead ingestion from prepared meat. In practice, use of a non-fragmenting bullet, and proper cleaning of the game animal's wound, can eliminate the risk of lead ingestion from eating game;<ref name="ReferenceA"/> however, isolating such practice to experimentally determine its association with blood lead levels in study is difficult to do. [[Bismuth]] is an element currently being introduced as a lead-replacement for shotgun pellets used in waterfowl hunting. The primary purpose is to prevent water contamination, however rather than making meat safe to consume.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Tera-ethyl-lead-chemical.png|right|thumb|[[Tetraethyllead]], still used as an additive in some fuels, can be absorbed through the skin.<ref name="Patrick06"/> |alt=Two chemical diagrams of tetra-ethyl lead, or (CH3CH2)4Pb. On the left one, carbon and hydrogen are labeled, on the right they are shown as lines only.]]

<!-- MEANS OF ABSORPTION -->
Exposure occurs through [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]] or occasionally skin contact. Lead may be taken in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. [[Tetraethyllead]], which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however [[inorganic]] lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin.<ref name="Patrick06"/> The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation.<ref name="Merrill07">[[#CITEREFMerrill07|Merrill, Morton, Soileau (2007)]] p. 860</ref> In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes into the bloodstream.<ref name="Merrill07"/> Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron.<ref name="Karri08"/> Children and infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.<ref name="Grant09-767">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 767</ref>

<!--
STORAGE -->
The main body compartments that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life of lead in these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone.<ref name="Karri08"/> Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful.<ref name="Rubin08">[[#CITEREFRubin08|Rubin, Strayer (2008)]] p. 266</ref> In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children.<ref name="Barbosa"/> The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30&nbsp;years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone.<ref name="Patrick06"/> The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40&nbsp;days, but it may be longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing [[bone remodeling|remodeling]], which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream.<ref name="Barbosa"/> Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone.<ref name="Hu07"/> Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.<ref name="Dart041426">[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] p. 1426</ref>

===Enzymes===
The primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to [[sulfhydryl group]]s found on many enzymes.<ref name="Pearson03"/> Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act.<ref name="Dart041426"/> Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same [[enzyme]]s as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.<ref name="Kosnett06-238">[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] p.238</ref>

<!-- HEME -->

{{quote|The great disadvantage of lead has always been that it is poisonous. This was fully recognised by the [[ancient history|ancients]], and [[Vitruvius]] specifically warns against its use.

In fact, two things make this otherwise attractive hypothesis impossible. First, the [[calcium carbonate]] deposit that formed so thickly inside the [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] channels also formed inside the pipes, effectively insulating the water from the lead, so that the two never touched. Second, because the Romans had so few [[faucet|taps]] and the water was constantly running, it was never actually inside the pipes for more than a few minutes, and certainly not long enough to become [[water pollution|contaminated]]. The [[thesis]] that the Romans contracted lead poisoning from the lead pipes in their water systems must therefore be declared completely unfounded.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=308}}</ref>}}

The government has suspended production at 32 of 35 lead plants.<ref name="China to relocate 15,000 from lead-poisoned area">{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20091016/hl_afp/healthchinaenvironmentpollutionlead|title=China to relocate 15,000 from lead-poisoned area|date=2009-10-16|publisher=AFP|accessdate=2009-10-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091019040748/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20091016/hl_afp/healthchinaenvironmentpollutionlead <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2009-10-19}}</ref> The affected area includes people from 10 different villages.<ref name="China to move residents from lead smelter base-report">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSPEK14546420091019|title=China to move residents from lead smelter base-report|date=2009-10-18|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>
