A '''watershed stroke''' is defined as an [[Brain ischemia|ischemia]], or blood flow blockage, that is localized to the border zones between the territories of two major [[Artery|arteries]] in the [[brain]]. [[Watershed area (medical)|Watershed]] locations are those border-zone regions in the brain supplied by the major [[cerebral arteries]] where [[Circulatory system|blood supply]] is decreased. Watershed strokes are a concern because they comprise approximately 10% of all [[ischemic stroke]] cases.<ref name=Torvik/>

Watershed strokes are localized to two primary regions of the brain, and are termed cortical watersheds (CWS) and internal watersheds (IWS).<ref name=Mayor>{{cite journal |last1=Momjian-Mayor |first1=Isabelle |last2=Baron |first2=Jean-Claude |title=The Pathophysiology of Watershed Infarction in Internal Carotid Artery Disease: Review of Cerebral Perfusion Studies |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |pages=567–77 |year=2005 |pmid=15692123 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000155727.82242.e1 |issue=3}}</ref> Patients with many different [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular diseases]] have a higher likelihood of experiencing a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] or loss of [[blood flow]] in border-zone regions of the brain. The resulting symptoms differ based on the affected area of the brain. A [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] are used for diagnosis, and afterward several treatment options are available, including the removal of [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic plaque]] and a physical widening of the clogged [[blood vessel]]. Long-term care is focused around three areas: rehabilitative therapy, surgical interventions, and prevention of future watershed strokes. Going forward, research to combat watershed strokes is focusing on various topics, such as [[stem cell]] research.

Watershed strokes are named because they affect the distal watershed areas of the brain. The original terminology came from the German literature, which used the analogy of an [[irrigation]] system. The German scholars compared the blood flow in [[distal]] [[Artery|arterial]] territories of the brain to the last field on a farm, which was the area with the least supply of water and therefore most vulnerable to any reduction in flow.<ref name=Bladin>{{cite journal |pages=477–8 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.24.3.477 |title=Confusing stroke terminology: Watershed or borderzone infarction? |year=1993 |last1=Bladin |first1=C. F. |last2=Chambers |first2=B. R. |last3=Donnan |first3=G. A. |journal=Stroke |volume=24 |issue=3 |pmid=8446987}}</ref> In a medical context, the term “watershed” refers to those areas of the brain that receive dual blood supply from the branching ends of two large arteries.<ref name=Bladin/>

These events are localized to two primary regions of the brain:

# [[Cerebral cortex|Cortical]] watershed strokes (CWS), or outer brain [[Infarction|infarcts]], are located between the cortical territories of the [[anterior cerebral artery]] (ACA), [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA), and [[posterior cerebral artery]] (PCA).<ref name="Mayor"/>
# Internal watershed strokes (IWS), or subcortical brain infarcts, are located in the [[white matter]] along and slightly above the [[Lateral ventricles|lateral ventricle]], between the deep and the superficial arterial systems of the MCA, or between the superficial systems of the MCA and ACA.<ref name="Mayor"/>

Nonetheless, within the literature itself, there exists confusion over the terminology used to describe cortical (outer brain) infarcts and subcortical (inner brain) infarcts.  Besides watershed, border-zone is another common term used to refer to areas of the brain between the ends of two adjacent arteries. Other less used terms include: borderland, end zone, boundary zone, and terminal zone. These varying terms have arisen from the considerable [[Anatomy|anatomic]] variability  both in the cerebral vascular structure and the territories of the brain that they supply.<ref name=Bladin/>

==Causes and risk factors==

Watershed strokes are caused by ischemia or a lack a blood flow to the brain.<ref name=Torvik>{{cite journal |pages=221–3 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.15.2.221 |title=The pathogenesis of watershed infarcts in the brain |year=1984 |last1=Torvik |first1=A. |journal=Stroke |volume=15 |issue=2 |pmid=6701929}}</ref>  There are several causes of ischemia, including [[embolism]] and [[atherosclerosis]].  There are several conditions that can predispose someone to watershed stroke by increasing the likelihood that insufficient blood supply will be able to reach the brain.  People with many different [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular diseases]] have a higher likelihood of experiencing a clot or a plaque that impedes flow through a [[blood vessel]].<ref name="Mayor"/>  Cardiovascular diseases that increase the risk of ischemia include:
*[[Heart failure|Congestive heart failure]], which can lead to an inability to pump sufficient amounts of blood to the brain
*Atherosclerosis, which can cause a buildup of cholesterol plaques in the blood vessels, thereby decreasing the volume of blood that can flow through the vessel and reach the brain<ref name="Mayor"/>
*[[Angiopathy]], a disease of the blood vessels<ref>{{cite journal |pages=605–10 |doi=10.1179/016164103101202048 |title=Cerebral hypoperfusion induces cortical watershed microinfarcts which may further aggravate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease |year=2003 |last1=Miklossy |first1=Judith |journal=Neurological Research |volume=25 |issue=6 |pmid=14503014}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
===Stroke signs and symptoms in general===

Watershed stroke symptoms are due to the reduced blood flow to all parts of the body, specifically the brain, thus leading to brain damage. Initial symptoms, as promoted by the American Stoke Association, are [[FAST (stroke)]], representing F = Facial weakness (droop), A = Arm weakness (drift), S = Speech difficulty (slur), and T = Time to act (priority of intervention).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00966-6 |title=Rapid ambulance protocol for acute stroke |year=1999 |last1=Harbison |first1=Jo |last2=Massey |first2=Anna |last3=Barnett |first3=Lee |last4=Hodge |first4=David |last5=Ford |first5=Gary A |journal=The Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9168 |pmid=10371574 |pages=1935}}</ref>

After the initial stroke, other symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. If one of the three [[Neural pathway|central nervous system pathways]] is affected, symptoms can include numbness, reduced sensation, and [[hyperreflexia]].

Most often, the side of the brain damaged results in body defects on the opposite side. Since the cranial nerves originate from the [[brainstem]], damage to this area can lead to defects in the function of these nerves. Symptoms can include altered breathing, problems with balance, drooping of eyelids, and decreased sensation in the face.<ref name="ReferenceA">Martini, F., Nath, J., [“Anatomy & Physiology.”] Boston: Pearson, 2010{{pn|date=December 2011}}</ref>

Damage to the cerebral cortex may lead to [[aphasia]] or confusion and damage to the [[cerebellum]] may lead to lack of motor movement.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Watershed stroke signs and symptoms===
Stroke presentations which are particularly suggestive of a watershed stroke include bilateral visual loss, stupor, and weakness of the proximal limbs, sparing the face hands and feet.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of a cerebral vascular accident begins with a general neurological examination, used to identify specific areas of resulting injury. A [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] of the brain is then used to identify any cerebral hemorrhaging. An MRI with special sequences called diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI), is very sensitive for locating areas of an ischemic based stroke, such as a watershed stroke.

Further diagnosis and evaluation of a stroke includes evaluation of the blood vessels in the neck using either Doppler ultrasound, MR-angiography or CT-angiography, or formal angiography. An echocardiogram may be performed looking for a cardiac source of emboli. Blood tests for risk factors also may be ordered, including cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, homocysteine levels, and blood coagulation tests.

===Classification systems===
*The Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the patient's initial symptoms. Based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as [[total anterior circulation infarct]] (TACI), [[partial anterior circulation infarct]] (PACI), [[lacunar infarct]] (LACI) or [[posterior circulation infarct]] (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1521–6 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)93206-O |title=Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction |year=1991 |last1=Bamford |first1=J. |last2=Sandercock |first2=P. |last3=Dennis |first3=M. |last4=Warlow |first4=C. |last5=Burn |first5=J. |journal=The Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8756 |pmid=1675378}} Later publications distinguish between "syndrome" and "infarct", based on evidence from imaging. "Syndrome" may be replaced by "hemorrhage" if imaging demonstrates a bleed.

* The TOAST (Trial of [[Danaparoid|Org 10172]] in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations. In this diagnostic system, a stroke is classified as being due to
# [[Thrombosis]] or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery
# Embolism of cardiac origin
# Occlusion of a small blood vessel<ref>{{cite journal |pages=35–41 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.24.1.35 |title=Classification of subtype of acute ischemic stroke.

==Pathogenesis==

Although many imaging techniques are used to document watershed strokes, their [[pathogenesis]] remains controversial. It may involve various mechanisms such as systemic hypotension, [[Embolism|microemboli]], severe aterial stenosis, ICA occlusion or a combination of these.<ref name=Mayor/>

===Hypotension===

A sharp drop in [[blood pressure]] is the most frequent cause of watershed infarcts. The most frequent location for a watershed stroke is the region between the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery. These events caused by hypotension do not usually cause the blood vessel to rupture.<ref name=Torvik/>

===Microemboli===

Microemboli have not been experimentally proven to cause watershed strokes. It is unclear whether they are a cause or an effect of a watershed stroke.<ref name=Grotta>{{cite journal |pages=2321–2 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.103.19.2321|pmid=11352876 |year=2001 |last1=Grotta |first1=JC |last2=Alexandrov |first2=AV |title=Preventing stroke: Is preventing microemboli enough? |volume=103 |issue=19 |journal=Circulation}}</ref> With watershed strokes, [[platelet]] aggregates block the small [[Middle meningeal artery|meningeal arteries]] in watershed regions creating a microembolism. Microemboli usually form as thrombi, and can block arteries outright. On the other hand, they often detach, move into blood circulation, and eventually block smaller downstream branches of arteries causing a thromboembolism. Generally, emboli travel as far outward as their size permits along the vascular branches of the brain. Using this hypothesis, microemboli are viewed as the cause of the infarct rather than secondary events. Nevertheless, secondary thrombi do form after infarcts, and therefore it has been difficult to distinguish between emboli and thrombi in watershed locations.<ref name=Torvik/> The best supporting evidence is correlative; patients display subcortical abnormalities on CT scans and present more microembolic signals during a [[carotid endarterectomy]].<ref name=Grotta/>

Microemboli can be common in some high-risk patients, such as those with carotid stenosis. However, in healthier patients strokes do not usually result from microemboli.<ref name=Grotta/>

===ICA occlusions===
{{Infobox Artery

| Caption = Arteries of the neck. The internal carotid arteries arise from the [[common carotid artery|common carotid arteries]] - labeled ''Common caroti'' on the figure.
}}

Thrombi at the split of the internal carotid artery in the neck may cause watershed infarcts between the territories of the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery. The resulting watershed infarcts in carotid artery blockages have mostly been considered to be due to a reduced blood flow, similar to that of hypotension.<ref name=Torvik/> Imaging studies in severe [[internal carotid artery]] (ICA) disease report an incidence of watershed stroke ranging from 19% to 64%.<ref name="Mayor"/>  Almost 40% of these watershed infarcts are attributed to narrowing of the carotid artery, which produces the reduced blood flow.<ref name="Mayor"/>

However, a different possible explanation has emerged. Alternatively, the vascular occlusion could be the result of microemboli from the carotid thrombi before the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] becomes completely blocked.<ref name=Torvik/> In this scenario, the clotting becomes too severe and the clot breaks free. The resulting traveling clot is known as an embolus (plural emboli). The wall of internal carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation (split) is a common site of atherosclerosis because of the unique [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] effects caused by the blood flow divider. As a result, thrombi formation is more prevalent there.<ref name=Grotta/> In general, researches have observed that this microembolization is a frequent phenomenon during the build-up of cerebral thrombi.<ref name=Torvik/> The resulting emboli are pieces of calcified plaque. If these microemboli are 0.1&nbsp;mm in diameter, they might pass into the small branches of the vascular system. There they may be destroyed by protective cellular defenses, or they may cause a stroke.<ref name=Grotta/> Altogether, these considerations suggest that the watershed infarcts in carotid thrombosis are caused by microembolization from mural thrombi, thrombi adherent to the vessel wall, rather than by blood flow disturbances.<ref name=Torvik/>

==Treatment==
===Carotid endarterectomy===
Often considered one of the safest ways to treat symptomatic carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is a procedure by which a surgeon gently removes atherosclerotic plaque. Blood flow hopefully then returns to normal, increasing oxygen concentration to normal amounts in watershed areas of the brain.

There is the potential for complications, including disturbing portions of the plaque leading to a stroke or heart attack during or after surgery. Small risks of bleeding and infection exist as well.<ref name="Pmid">{{cite journal |pages=860–5; discussion 865 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000358953.19069.E5 |title=Safety, Effectiveness, and Practicality of Endovascular Therapy Within the First 3 Hours of Acute Ischemic Stroke Onset |year=2009 |last1=Mathews |first1=Marlon S. |last2=Sharma |first2=Jitendra |last3=Snyder |first3=Kenneth V. |last4=Natarajan |first4=Sabareesh K. |last5=Siddiqui |first5=Adnan H. |last6=Hopkins |first6=L. Nelson |last7=Levy |first7=Elad I. |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=65 |issue=5}}</ref>

===Percutaneous treatments of carotid stenosis===
In this type of procedure, a narrowed blood vessel is expanded via angioplasty or stenting. A thin angiography catheter is inserted in a large groin blood vessel and advanced to the stenosis. Percutaneous treatment is less invasive than endarterectomy, usually requiring only local anesthesia. Endarterectomy is still considered safer though, as percutaneous treatments can lead to accidental dislodging of plaque or even arterial rupturing.<ref name="Pmid" />

====Carotid angioplasty====
During carotid [[angioplasty]], an angiography cather with a small deflated balloon attached on the tip is advanced to a carotid stenosis. The ballon is then inflated slowly, forcing the narrowed portion of the vessel to expand.

====Carotid stenting====
Carotid stenting follows a similar procedure. Rather than using a balloon, a stent (metal mesh-like tube) is placed over the atherosclerotic plaque in the hopes of stabilizing it and allowing for increased blood flow to watershed portions of the brain.

==Long-term care and rehabilitation==

Watershed strokes are seldom fatal, but they can lead to neuromuscular degeneration, as well as [[dementia]].<ref name="Mayor"/>  This degeneration at the watershed regions of the brain can lead to difficulties with movement and motor coordination, as well as speech.  Long-term care is focused around three areas: rehabilitative therapy, surgical interventions, and prevention of future watershed strokes.

===Rehabilitative therapies===
Long-term rehabilitative therapy for watershed stroke patients involves physical, occupational, and speech and language therapies.  Physical therapy can be used to enhance motor function in the legs and arms that has been impacted by stroke.<ref name>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006609.pub2 |title=Hands-on therapy interventions for upper limb motor dysfunction following stroke |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2011 |last1=Winter |first1=Jackie |last2=Hunter |first2=Susan |last3=Sim |first3=Julius |last4=Crome |first4=Peter |editor1-last=Winter |editor1-first=Jackie |pmid=21678359 |issue=6 |pages=CD006609}}</ref>  [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapies]] can be provided to help to alleviate cognitive impairments that result from watershed stroke,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006430.pub2 |title=Occupational therapy for cognitive impairment in stroke patients |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2010 |last1=Hoffmann |first1=Tammy |last2=Bennett |first2=Sally |last3=Koh |first3=Chia-Lin |last4=McKenna |first4=Kryss T |editor1-last=Hoffmann |editor1-first=Tammy |pmid=20824849 |issue=9 |pages=CD006430}}</ref> as well as to improve fine motor function that was damaged as a result of the stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39343.466863.55 |title=Occupational therapy for patients with problems in personal activities of daily living after stroke: Systematic review of randomised trials |year=2007 |last1=Legg |first1=L. |last2=Drummond |first2=A. |last3=Leonardi-Bee |first3=J. |last4=Gladman |first4=J R F |last5=Corr |first5=S. |last6=Donkervoort |first6=M. |last7=Edmans |first7=J. |last8=Gilbertson |first8=L. |last9=Jongbloed |first9=L. |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7626 |pmid=17901469 |pmc=2048861 |pages=922}}</ref>  Stroke can also cause impairments in speech production secondary to neurocognitive and neuromuscular impairments, and therefore speech and language therapies are often a component of long-term care for stroke patients.  Intensive speech and language therapy has been shown to improve speech deficits associated with [[aphasia]] resulting from stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub2 |chapter=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2010 |last1=Kelly |first1=Helen |last2=Brady |first2=Marian C |last3=Enderby |first3=Pam |editor1-last=Brady |editor1-first=Marian C}}</ref>

===Surgical interventions===

Endovascular interventions, including surgical [[revascularization]], can increase blood flow in the area of the stroke, thereby decreasing the likelihood that insufficient blood flow to the watershed regions of the brain will result in subsequent strokes.<ref name="Pmid" />  Neuroscientists are currently researching stem cell transplantation therapies to improve recovery of cebreral tissue in affected areas of the brain post-stroke.  Should this intervention be proven effective, it will greatly increase the number of neurons in the brain that can recover from a stroke.<ref name=pmid21499328>{{cite journal |pmid=21499328 |year=2011 |last1=Jablonska |first1=Anna |last2=Lukomska |first2=Barbara |title=Stroke induced brain changes: Implications for stem cell transplantation |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=74–85 |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=7107}}</ref>

===Prevention of future strokes===

There are several interventions that are often used to help prevent the recurrence of a watershed stroke; namely, nutritional interventions, as well as antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and statin drug use.  Nutritional interventions, including increased consumption of certain [[amino acid|amino acids]], [[Antioxidant|antioxidants]], [[B vitamins|B-group vitamins]], and zinc, have been shown to increase the recovery of neurocognitive function after a stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=339–45 |doi=10.1177/0884533611405793 |title=Nutrition for Brain Recovery After Ischemic Stroke: An Added Value to Rehabilitation |year=2011 |last1=Aquilani |first1=R. |last2=Sessarego |first2=P. |last3=Iadarola |first3=P. |last4=Barbieri |first4=A. |last5=Boschi |first5=F. |journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice |volume=26 |issue=3 |pmid=21586419}}</ref> [[Antiplatelet drug]]s, such as aspirin, as well as [[anticoagulant]]s, are used to help prevent blood clots and therefore embolisms, which can cause watershed strokes.  [[Statin]] drugs are also used to control hyperlipidemia, another risk factor for watershed stroke.

==Current and future research==
===Stem cell transplantation===
Ischemic stroke is still a major health concern and studies are being conducted to determine the pathway in which brain damage occurs to identify targets for intervention.  Stem cell transplantation may help in intervention to improve cell recovery and regeneration.<ref name=pmid21499328/>

===Strokes after cardiac surgery===
Although the mechanism is not entirely understood, the likelihood of a watershed stroke increases after cardiac surgery. An experiment conducted in a five year span studied the diagnosis, etiology, and outcome of these postoperative strokes. It was observed that intraoperative decrease in blood pressure may lead to these strokes and patients who have undergone aortic procedures are more likely to have bilateral watershed infarcts. Furthermore, bilateral watershed strokes are associated with poor, short-term outcomes and are most reliably observed by diffusion-weighted imaging MRI. Thus future clinical research and practice should focus on the identification of bilateral stroke characteristics. This identification can help discover affected areas and increase correct diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16857947 |year=2006 |last1=Gottesman |first1=Rebecca F. |last2=Sherman |first2=Paul M. |last3=Grega |first3=Maura A. |last4=Yousem |first4=David M. |last5=Borowicz Jr |first5=Louis M. |last6=Selnes |first6=Ola A. |last7=Baumgartner |first7=William A. |last8=McKhann |first8=Guy M. |title=Watershed Strokes After Cardiac Surgery: Diagnosis, Etiology, and Outcome |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=2306–11 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000236024.68020.3a |journal=Stroke}}</ref>

===Deep watershed infarcts===
Hemodynamic impairment is thought to be the cause of deep watershed infarcts, characterized by a rosary-like pattern. However new studies have shown that microembolism might also contribute to the development of deep watershed infarcts. The dual contribution of hemodynamic impairment and microembolism would result in different treatment for patients with these specific infarcts.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21852602 |year=2011 |last1=Moustafa |first1=Ramez Reda |last2=Momjian-Mayor |first2=Isabelle |last3=Jones |first3=P.

===Basilar artery (BA) stenting===
While intracranial artery stenting is used for same side stoke prevention, [[basilar artery]] stenting may help to improve parallel, accessory blood flow. The stent may also lead to termination of recurrent middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnis.2009.001958 |title=Use of far field basilar artery stenting for recurrent middle cerebral artery ischemia |year=2010 |last1=Titsworth |first1=W.

===Penumbra imaging===
The area around the damaged ischemia is known as the penumbra. This viable area has the ability to regenerate with the help of pharmacological treatment however most patients with penumbra are left untreated. New research is being conducted in metabolic suppression, direct energy delivery, and selective drug delivery to help salvage this area of the brain after a stroke.<ref name=pmid20607107>{{cite journal |pmid=20607107 |year=2010 |last1=Liu |first1=S |last2=Levine |first2=SR |last3=Winn |first3=HR |title=Targeting ischemic penumbra: Part I - from pathophysiology to therapeutic strategy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=47–55 |pmc=2896002 |journal=Journal of experimental stroke & translational medicine}}</ref>

====CLEVSRKNC peptide====
This new drug has been shown to home to ischemic stroke tissue as well as [[Apoptosis|apoptotic]] neuronal cells of the penumbra region. This discovery may help in creating selective drug delivery for stroke patients.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=167–72 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.07.020 |title=Detection of apoptosis in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia using a homing peptide selected from in vivo phage display |year=2008 |last1=Hong |first1=Hai-Yan |last2=Choi |first2=Jung Sook |last3=Kim |first3=Yoon Jung |last4=Lee |first4=Hwa Young |last5=Kwak |first5=Wonjung |last6=Yoo |first6=Jeongsoo |last7=Lee |first7=Jae-Tae |last8=Kwon |first8=Tae-Hwan |last9=Kim |first9=In-San |journal=Journal of Controlled Release |volume=131 |issue=3 |pmid=18692101}}</ref>

====Liposomal drug delivery====
Nanoliposomes are currently being researched for specific drug delivery due to their ph-sensitive and high [[blood–brain barrier]] diffusion characteristics. Many advantages of these drugs include:
#Drugs can be maintained in the active state while encapsulated.
#Being encapsulated provides direct access to target tissue
#Prevention of non-specific binding
#Allows for a high concentration of drug
Due to the fact that acidic environment and low blood flow are prominent characteristic of the penumbra area, [[Liposome|liposomal]] drugs seem to be well suited.<ref name=pmid20607107/>
