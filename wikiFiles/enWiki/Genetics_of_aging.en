'''Genetics of aging''' is generally concerned with [[life extension]] associated with genetic alterations, rather than with [[Progeroid syndromes|accelerated aging disease]]s leading to reduction in lifespan.

The first [[mutation]] found to increase [[longevity]] in an animal was the ''age-1'' gene in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''. Michael Klass discovered that lifespan of ''C.&nbsp;elegans'' could be altered by mutations, but Klass believed that the effect was due to reduced food consumption ([[calorie restriction]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Klass MR | title=A method for the isolation of longevity mutants in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and initial results | journal=MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT  | volume=22 | issue=3-4 | year=1983 | pages=279–286 | id=PMID 6632998 }}</ref> Thomas Johnson later showed that [[life extension]] of up to 65% was due to the mutation itself rather than due to calorie restriction,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Friedman DB, Johnson TE | title=A mutation in the age-1 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans lengthens life and reduces hermaphrodite fertility | journal=[[Genetics (journal)]]  | volume=118 | issue=1 | year=1988 | pages=75–86  | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/118/1/75.long | format=[[PDF]] | pmc = 1203268 | id=PMID 8608934 }}</ref> and he named the gene ''age-1'' in the expectation that other such genes would be found. The ''age-1'' gene encodes the catalytic subunit of [[Class I PI 3-kinases|class-I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase]]&nbsp;(PI3K).

A decade after Johnson's discovery [[Daf-2|''daf-2'']], one of the two genes that are essential for [[dauer larva]] formation,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gottlieb S, Ruvkun G | title=daf-2, daf-16 and daf-23: genetically interacting genes controlling Dauer formation in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal=[[Genetics (journal)]]  | volume=137 | issue=1 | year=1994 | pages=107–120  | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/137/1/107.long | pmc = 1205929 | id=PMID 8056303 }}</ref> was shown by [[Cynthia Kenyon]] to double ''C.&nbsp;elegans'' lifespan.<ref name="pmid8247153">{{cite journal | author=Kenyon C, Chang J, Gensch E, Rudner A, Tabtiang R | title=A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type | journal=[[Nature (journal)]]  | volume=366 | issue=6454 | year=1993 | pages=461–464 | id=PMID 8247153 }}</ref> Kenyon showed that the [[Daf-2|''daf-2'']] mutants, which would form dauers above {{Convert|25|C|K F|0}} would bypass the dauer state below {{Convert|20|C|K F|0}} with a doubling of lifespan.<ref name="pmid8247153" />

Genetic modifications in other species have not achieved as great a lifespan extension as have been seen for ''C.&nbsp;elegans''.
