The '''combined oral contraceptive pill''' ('''COCP'''), often referred to as the '''birth-control pill''' or colloquially as  "'''the Pill'''", is a birth control method that includes a combination of an [[estrogen]] ([[estradiol]]) and a [[progestogen]] ([[progestin]]). When taken by mouth every day, these pills inhibit female fertility. They were first approved for contraceptive use in the [[United States]] in 1960, and are a very popular form of [[birth control]]. They are currently used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million women in the United States.<!--

==Medical use==
[[File:pillpacketopen.jpg|frame|Half-used blister pack of LevlenED]]
Combined oral contraceptive pills should be taken at the same time each day. If one or more tablets are forgotten for more than 12 hours, contraceptive protection will be reduced.<!--
 --><ref name="mercilon spc">{{cite web|author=[[Organon International|Organon]] |month=November |year=2001 |title=Mercilon SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics |url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=5384 |accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> Most brands of combined pills are packaged in one of two different packet sizes, with days marked off for a 28 day cycle. For the 21-pill packet, a pill is consumed daily for three weeks, followed by a week of no pills. For the 28-pill packet, 21 pills are taken, followed by week of placebo or [[Placebo|sugar pills]]. A woman on the pill will have a withdrawal bleed sometime during the placebo week, and is still protected from pregnancy during this week. There are also two newer combination birth control pills (Yaz 28 and Loestrin 24 Fe) that have 24 days of active hormone pills, followed by 4 days of placebo.<ref name="Birth Control Pills">Stacey, Dawn. [http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/p/ThePill.htm ''Birth Control Pills'']. Retrieved July 20, 2009.</ref>

===Placebo pills===
The placebo pills allow the user to take a pill every day; remaining in the daily habit even during the week without hormones. Placebo pills may contain an [[iron]] supplement,<ref>{{cite web |title = US Patent:Oral contraceptive:Patent 6451778 Issued on September 17, 2002 Estimated Expiration Date: July 2, 2017. |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6451778/description.html |publisher= PatentStorm LLC |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Iron deficiency in Europe |author=Serge Herceberg | author2=Paul Preziosi |author3=Pilar Galan |url=http://www.idpas.org/pdf/1174IronDeficiencyinEurope.pdf |journal=Public Health Nutrition: 4(2B) |pages=537–545 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> as iron requirements increase during menstruation.

Failure to take pills during the placebo week does not impact the effectiveness of the pill, provided that daily ingestion of active pills is resumed at the end of the week.

The withdrawal bleeding that occurs during the break from active pills was thought to be comforting, as a physical confirmation of not being pregnant.<ref name="gladwell">{{Cite journal| last = Gladwell | first = Malcolm | title = John Rock's Error | journal = The New Yorker | date = 2000-03-10 | url= http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm | accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> The 28-day pill package also simulates the average [[menstrual cycle]], though the hormonal events during a pill cycle are significantly different from those of a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. The pill suppresses the normal cycle, and the withdrawal bleeding occurs while the placebo pills are taken. The withdrawal bleeding is also predictable. Unexpected breakthrough bleeding can be a possible side effect of longer term active regimens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic staff|title=Birth control pill FAQ: Benefits, risks and choices|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/birth-control-pill/WO00098|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref>

===Less frequent placebos===
{{Main|Extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pill}}
If the pill formulation is monophasic, it is possible to skip withdrawal bleeding and still remain protected against conception by skipping the placebo pills and starting directly with the next packet. Attempting this with bi- or tri-phasic pill formulations carries an increased risk of [[breakthrough bleeding]] and may be undesirable. It will not, however, increase the risk of getting pregnant.

Starting in 2003, women have also been able to use a three-month version of the Pill.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web| coauthors = FDA |title=FDA Approves Seasonale Oral Contraceptivel |work=|publisher=|date=2003-09-25 |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01251.html |accessdate=2006-11-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061007101134/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01251.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-07}}</ref> Similar to the effect of using a constant-dosage formulation and skipping the placebo weeks for three months, [[Seasonale]] gives the benefit of less frequent periods, at the potential drawback of breakthrough bleeding. Seasonique is another version in which the placebo week every three months is replaced with a week of low-dose estrogen.

A version of the combined pill has also been packaged to completely eliminate placebo pills and withdrawal bleeds. Marketed as Anya or Lybrel, studies have shown that after seven months, 71% of users no longer had any breakthrough bleeding, the most common side effect of going longer periods of time without breaks from active pills.<!--

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of COCPs, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed in two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who take the pills consistently and correctly. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all COCP users, including those who take the pills incorrectly, inconsistently, or both. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use.<!--
 --><ref name="hatcher">{{cite book| last = Hatcher| first = RA| title = Contraceptive Technology| url = http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html| edition = 18th| year = 2000| publisher = Ardent Media| location = New York| isbn = 0-9664902-6-6| author-separator = ,| display-authors = 2| author2 = Trussel J| author3 = Stewart F }}</ref> Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite book| coauthors = Sheila Kippley| last = Kippley| first = John| title = The Art of Natural Family Planning| edition = 4th| year = 1996| publisher = The Couple to Couple League| location = Cincinnati, OH| isbn = 0-926412-13-2| page = 141 }}</ref>

The typical use pregnancy rate among COCP users varies depending on the population being studied, ranging from 2-8% per year. The perfect use pregnancy rate of COCPs is 0.3% per year.<ref name="hatcher" />

Several factors account for typical use effectiveness being lower than perfect use effectiveness:
* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the user
* conscious user non-compliance with instructions.

For instance, someone using oral forms of hormonal birth control might be given incorrect information by a health care provider as to the frequency of intake, or by mistake not take the pill one day, or simply not go to the pharmacy on time to renew the prescription.

COCPs provide effective contraception from the very first pill if started within five days of the beginning of the [[menstrual cycle]] (within five days of the first day of [[menstruation]]). If started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, COCPs provide effective contraception only after 7 consecutive days use of active pills, so a backup method of contraception must be used until active pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days. COCPs should be taken at approximately the same time every day.<!--
  --><ref name="speroff"/><!--
  --><ref name="FFPRHC COC">{{cite web|author=[[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|FFPRHC]] |year=2007 |title=Clinical Guidance: First Prescription of Combined Oral Contraception |url=http://www.ffprhc.org.uk/admin/uploads/FirstPrescCombOralContJan06.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-26|format=PDF}}</ref>

Contraceptive efficacy may be impaired by: 1) missing more than one active pill in a packet, 2) delay in starting the next packet of active pills (i.e., extending the pill-free, inactive or placebo pill period beyond 7 days), 3) [[intestine|intestinal]] [[malabsorption]] of active pills due to [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]], 4) drug interactions with active pills that decrease contraceptive estrogen or progestogen levels.<!--
  --><ref name="speroff"/>

===Non-contraceptive use===
The hormones in "the Pill" have also been used to treat other medical conditions, such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), [[endometriosis]], [[amenorrhea]], menstrual cramps, [[adenomyosis]], menorrhagia (excessive menstral bleeding), menstruation-related anemia and [[dysmenorrhea]] (painful menstruation).<ref>{{cite web|last=CYWH Staff|title=Medical Uses of the Birth Control Pill|url=http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/med-uses-ocp.html|accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref>  Though extensively used for these conditions, no oral contraceptives have been approved by the U.S. FDA for those uses because of lack of convincing scientific evidence that the benefits outweigh the risks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In addition, oral contraceptives are sometimes prescribed as medication for mild or moderate acne, although none are approved by the U.S. FDA for that sole purpose.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2005.07.010 |title=Treating acne with oral contraceptives: Use of lower doses |year=2006 |last1=Huber |first1=Johannes |last2=Walch |first2=Katharina |journal=Contraception |volume=73|pages=23–9 |pmid=16371290 |issue=1}}</ref> Three different oral contraceptives have been FDA approved to treat moderate acne if the patient is at least 14 or 15 years old, have already begun menstruating, and need contraception.  They include [[Ortho Tri-Cyclen]], [[Estrostep]], and [[Drospirenone|YAZ]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Chang, MD|first=Louise|title=Birth Control of Acne|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/birth-control-for-acne-treatment|publisher=WebMD, LLC|accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref>   Although the pill is sometimes prescribed to induce menstruation on a regular schedule for women bothered by irregular menstrual cycles, it actually suppresses the normal menstrual cycle and then mimics a regular 28-day monthly cycle, as noted earlier in this article.

==Drug interactions==
Some [[Medication|drug]]s reduce the effect of the Pill and can cause [[breakthrough bleeding]], or increased chance of pregnancy. These include drugs such as [[rifampicin]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]]. In addition cautions are given about broad spectrum antibiotics, such as [[ampicillin]] and [[doxycycline]], which may cause problems "by impairing the [[Human flora|bacterial flora]] responsible for recycling [[ethinylestradiol]] from the large bowel" ([[British National Formulary|BNF]] 2003).<!--
  --><ref>The effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on Combined contraceptive pills is not found on systematic interaction metanalysis (Archer, 2002), although "individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol when they take certain other antibiotics" (Dickinson, 2001). "...experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction" (DeRossi, 2002) and this remains current (2006) UK [http://www.fpa.org.uk/information/leaflets/documents_and_pdfs/detail.cfm?contentID=130#17 Family Planning Association advice].</ref><!--

The traditional medicinal herb [[St John's Wort]] has also been implicated due to its upregulation of the [[P450]] system in the [[liver]].

==Common side effects==
Different sources note different incidences of side effects. The most common side effect is [[breakthrough bleeding]]. A 1992 French review article said that as many as 50% of new first-time users discontinue the birth control pill before the end of the first year because of the annoyance of side effects such as breakthrough bleeding and [[amenorrhea]].<ref name="serfaty">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01849448 |title=Medical aspects of oral contraceptive discontinuation |year=1992 |last1=Serfaty |first1=D. |journal=Advances in Contraception |volume=8 |pages=21}}<br />

==Major side effects==

It is generally accepted by medical authorities that the health risks of oral contraceptives are lower than those from pregnancy and birth,<ref>{{Cite book| author=Crooks, Robert L. and Karla Baur | title=Our Sexuality | year=2005 | publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA | isbn=0-534-65176-3}}{{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> and "the health benefits of any method of contraception are far greater than any risks from the method".<ref>[[WHO]] (2005).

===Venous thromboembolism===
Combined oral contraceptives increase the risk of [[venous thromboembolism]] (including [[deep vein thrombosis]] [DVT] and [[pulmonary embolism]] [PE]).<ref name="VTE10">{{cite journal |doi=10.1586/erc.09.175 |title=Venous thromboembolism in women taking hormonal contraceptives |year=2010 |last1=Blanco-Molina |first1=Ángeles |last2=Monreal |first2=Manuel |journal=Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=211–5 |pmid=20136607}}</ref> These blood clots can cause permanent disability or death.

The risk of thromboembolism varies with different types of birth control pills.  For the second-generation pills (with an estrogen content less than 50 μg), the risk of thromboembolism is relatively small, with an incidence of approximately 15 per 100,000 users per year, compared with 5 per 100,000 per year among non-pregnant women who do not take any oral contraceptives, and 60 per 100,000 pregnancies.<ref name="Rang 2012">{{cite book| last1 = Rang| first1 = Humphrey P.| last2 = Dale| first2 = Maureen M.| last3 = Ritter| first3 = James M.| last4 = Flower| first4 = Rod J.| last5 = Henderson| first5 = Graeme| title = Rang and Dale's pharmacology| edition = 7th| year = 2012| publisher = Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone| location = Edinburgh| isbn = 978-0-7020-3471-8| page = 426| chapter = The reproductive system }}</ref> However, in girls and women taking oral contraceptives containing third-generation progestogens ([[drospirenone]], [[desogestrel]],or [[gestodene]]), the incidence of thromboembolism is much higher: approximately 25 per 100,000 users per year.<ref name="Rang 2012"/> Although lower than the risk during pregnancy, this is much higher than the risk of older versions of the Pill that are still available throughout the world.  For example, women who take COCPs containing [[drospirenone]] have a six- to sevenfold risk of developing [[thromboembolism]] (dangerous blood clots) compared to women who do not take any contraceptive pill, and have twice the risk compared to women who take a contraceptive pill containing [[levonorgestrel]], a different type of progesterone found in many generic birth control pills.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lidegaard et al. | title = Risk of venous thromboembolism from use of oral contraceptives containing different progestogens and oestrogen doses | journal = BMJ | volume = 343 | pages = 1–15 | year = 2011 | doi= 10.1136/bmj.d6423 }}</ref>

A large 1996 collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found that: ''"The results provide strong evidence for two main conclusions. First, while women are taking combined oral contraceptives and in the 10 years after stopping there is a small increase in the relative risk of having breast cancer diagnosed. Second, there is no significant excess risk of having breast cancer diagnosed 10 or more years after stopping use. The cancers diagnosed in women who had used combined oral contraceptives were less advanced clinically than those diagnosed in women who had never used these contraceptives."''<!--

===Elevated potassium===
Drospirenone found in Yaz, Yasmin, Beyaz, and several other COCPs can increase potassium to dangerous levels ([[hyperkalemia]]).<ref>[http://www.virginiahopkinstestkits.com/yaz_side_effects_pf.html  Yaz® Side Effects - PF].

===Weight===
The same 1992 French review article noted that in the subgroup of adolescents 15–19 years of age in the 1982 [[National Center for Health Statistics|National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)]] who had stopped taking the Pill, 20–25% reported they stopped taking the Pill because of either [[acne vulgaris|acne]] or weight gain, and another 25% stopped because of fear of cancer.<!--

Many clinicians consider the public perception of weight gain on the Pill to be inaccurate and dangerous.  A 2000 British review article concluded there is no evidence that modern low-dose pills cause weight gain, but that fear of weight gain contributed to poor compliance in taking the Pill and subsequent [[unintended pregnancy]], especially among adolescents.<!--

More recently a Swedish study concluded that combined oral contraceptive use was not found to be a predictor for weight increase in the long term.  Postal questionnaires regarding weight/height, and contraception were sent to random samples of 19-year-old women born in 1962 (n = 656) and 1972 (n = 780) in 1981 and 1991. The responders were followed longitudinally, and the same women were contacted again every fifth year from 1986–2006 and from 1996–2006, respectively. There was no significant difference in weight increase in the women grouped according to use or non-use of combined oral contraceptive or duration of combined oral contraceptive use. The two cohorts of women were grouped together in a longitudinal analysis and the following factors age, combined oral contraceptive use, children, smoking and exercise were included in the model. The only predictor for weight increase was age (P < 0.001), resulting in a gain of 0.45&nbsp;kg/year. Smokers decreased (P < 0.001) their weight by 1.64&nbsp;kg per 15 years.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/humrep/der094|pmid=21507999 |title=The long-term influence of combined oral contraceptives on body weight |year=2011 |last1=Lindh |first1=I. |last2=Ellstrom |first2=A.

===Depression===
Low levels of [[serotonin]], a neurotransmitter in the brain, have been linked to [[Clinical depression|depression]]. High levels of estrogen, as in first-generation COCPs, and progestin, as in some progestin-only contraceptives, have been shown to promote the lowering of brain serotonin levels by increasing the concentration of a brain enzyme that reduces serotonin.<ref name="hatcher"/> This observation, along with some small research studies<!--

Bradykinin lowers blood pressure by causing blood vessel dilation.  Certain enzymes are capable of breaking down bradykinin ( Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Aminopeptidase P).

===Mortality===
Overall, use of oral contraceptives appears to slightly reduce all-cause mortality, with a [[rate ratio]] for overall mortality of 0.87 ([[confidence interval]]: 0.79–0.96) when comparing ever-users of OCs with never-users.<ref name="vessey">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2010.04.006 |title=Factors affecting mortality in a large cohort study with special reference to oral contraceptive use |year=2010 |last1=Vessey |first1=Martin |last2=Yeates |first2=David |last3=Flynn |first3=Susan |journal=Contraception |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=221–9 |pmid=20705149}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Combined oral contraceptives are generally accepted to be contraindicated in women with pre-existing [[cardiovascular disease]], in women who have a familial tendency to form blood clots (such as familial [[factor V Leiden]]), women with severe [[obesity]] and/or [[hypercholesterolemia]] (high cholesterol level), and in [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] over age 40.

COC are also contraindicated for women with liver tumors, [[hepatic adenoma]] or severe cirrhosis of the liver, and for those with known or suspected breast cancer.   (WHO category 4).

== Mechanism of action ==
Combined oral contraceptive pills were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. Combined hormonal contraceptives, including COCPs, inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.<ref name="Nelson 2011">{{cite book| last1 = Nelson| first1 = Anita L.| last2 = Cwiak| first2 = Carrie| editor1-last = Hatcher| editor1-first = Robert A.| editor2-last = Trussell| editor2-first = James| editor3-last = Nelson| editor3-first = Anita L.| editor4-last = Cates| editor4-first = Willard Jr.| editor5-last = Kowal| editor5-first = Deborah| editor6-last = Policar| editor6-first = Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.<br/>Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.</blockquote></ref><ref name="Speroff 2011">{{cite book| last1 = Speroff| first1 = Leon| last2 = Darney| first2 = Philip D.| title = A clinical guide for contraception| edition = 5th| year = 2011| publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| location = Philadelphia| isbn = 978-1-60831-610-6| pages = 19–152| chapter = Oral contraception }}</ref><ref name="Levin 2011">{{cite book| first = Ellis R.| last1 = Levin| last2 = Hammes| first2 = Stephen R.| editor1-last = Brunton| editor2-last = Chabner| editor2-first = Bruce A.| editor3-last = Knollmann| editor3-first = Björn C.| title = Goodman & Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics| edition = 12th| year = 2011| publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-07-162442-8| pages = 1163–1194| chapter = Estrogens and progestins }}</ref><ref name="Glasier 2010">{{cite book| last = [[Anna Glasier|Glasier]]| first = Anna| editor1-last = Jameson| editor1-first = J.

Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.<ref name="Nelson 2011"/><ref name="Speroff 2011"/><ref name="Levin 2011"/>

Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.<ref name="Nelson 2011"/><ref name="Speroff 2011"/><ref name="Levin 2011"/>

Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].<ref name="Nelson 2011"/>

The estrogen and progestogen in COCPs have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:<ref name="Nelson 2011"/>
* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].
* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].
* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.

Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during COCP use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of COCPs.<ref name="Nelson 2011"/>

==Formulations==
{{Main|Oral contraceptive formulations}}

Oral contraceptives come in a variety of formulations. The main division is between combined oral contraceptive pills, containing both [[estrogen]] and [[progestin]]s and [[progestogen only pill|progestin only pill]]s. Combined oral contraceptive pills also come in varying types, including varying doses of estrogen, and whether the dose of estrogen or progestin changes from 1 week to the next.

In 1939, [[Russell Marker]], a professor of [[organic chemistry]] at [[Pennsylvania State University]], developed a method of synthesizing [[progesterone]] from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]], which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the [[saponin]] from inedible Mexican yams (''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]'' and ''[[Dioscorea composita]]'') found in the rain forests of [[Veracruz]] near [[Orizaba]]. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety [[diosgenin]]. Unable to interest his research sponsor [[Parke-Davis]] in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded [[Syntex]] with two partners in [[Mexico City]]. When he left Syntex a year later the [[Mexican barbasco trade|trade of the barbasco yam]] had started and the period of the heyday of the [[Marker degradation#Mexican steroid industry|Mexican steroid industry]] had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.<!--

Midway through 20th century, the stage was set for the development of a [[hormonal contraceptive]], but pharmaceutical companies, universities and governments showed no interest in pursuing research.<!--
 --><ref name="tone"/>

===Studies of progesterone to prevent ovulation===
In early 1951, reproductive [[physiologist]] [[Gregory Pincus]], a leader in hormone research and co-founder of the [[Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology]] (WFEB) in [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts]], first met American birth control movement founder [[Margaret Sanger]] at a [[Manhattan]] dinner hosted by Abraham Stone, medical director and vice president of [[Planned Parenthood]] (PPFA), who helped Pincus obtain a small grant from PPFA to begin hormonal contraceptive research. Research started on April 25, 1951 with reproductive physiologist [[Min Chueh Chang]] repeating and extending the 1937 experiments of Makepeace ''et al.'' that showed injections of progesterone suppressed ovulation in rabbits. In October 1951, [[G. D. Searle & Company]] refused Pincus' request to fund his hormonal contraceptive research, but retained him as a consultant and continued to provide chemical compounds to evaluate.<!--
 --><ref name="maisel"/><!--
 --><ref name="reed"/>

In March 1952, Sanger wrote a brief note mentioning Pincus' research to her longtime friend and supporter, [[women's suffrage|suffragist]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Katharine Dexter McCormick]], who visited the WFEB and its co-founder and old friend Hudson Hoagland in June 1952 to learn about contraceptive research there. Frustrated when research stalled from PPFA's lack of interest and meager funding, McCormick arranged a meeting at the WFEB on June 6, 1953 with Sanger and Hoagland, where she first met Pincus who committed to dramatically expand and accelerate research with McCormick providing fifty times PPFA's previous funding.<!--

Pincus and McCormick enlisted [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]] clinical professor of [[obstetrics and gynaecology|gynecology]] [[John Rock (American scientist)|John Rock]], chief of gynecology at the [[Free Hospital for Women]] and an expert in the treatment of [[infertility]], to lead clinical research with women. At a scientific conference in 1952, Pincus and Rock, who had known each other for many years, discovered they were using similar approaches to achieve opposite goals. In 1952, Rock induced a three-month [[anovulatory]] "pseudo-pregnancy" state in eighty of his infertility patients with continuous gradually increasing oral doses of [[estrogen]] ([[diethylstilbestrol]] 5–30&nbsp;mg/day) and progesterone (50–300&nbsp;mg/day) and within the following four months an encouraging 15% became pregnant.<!--

In 1953, at Pincus' suggestion, Rock induced a three-month anovulatory "pseudo-pregnancy" state in twenty-seven of his infertility patients with an oral 300&nbsp;mg/day progesterone-only regimen for 20 days from [[menstrual cycle|cycle]] days 5–24 followed by pill-free days to produce [[menstrual cycle|withdrawal bleeding]]. This produced the same encouraging 15% pregnancy rate during the following four months without the troubling [[amenorrhea]] of the previous continuous estrogen and progesterone regimen. But 20% of the women experienced [[breakthrough bleeding]] and in the first cycle ovulation was suppressed in only 85% of the women, indicating that even higher and more expensive oral doses of progesterone would be needed to initially consistently suppress ovulation.<!--

===Studies of progestins to prevent ovulation===
Pincus asked his contacts at pharmaceutical companies to send him chemical compounds with progestogenic activity. Chang screened nearly 200 chemical compounds in animals and found the three most promising were Syntex's [[norethindrone]] and Searle's [[norethynodrel]] and [[norethandrolone]].<!--
 --><ref name="chang">{{Cite journal|author=Chang MC |year=1978 |title=Development of the oral contraceptives |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=217–9 |pmid=356615}}</ref>

Chemists [[Carl Djerassi]], [[Luis E. Miramontes|Luis Miramontes]], and [[George Rosenkranz]] at Syntex in Mexico City had synthesized the first orally highly active progestin norethindrone in 1951. Chemist [[Frank B. Colton]] at Searle in [[Skokie, Illinois]] had synthesized the orally highly active progestins norethynodrel (an isomer of norethindrone) in 1952 and norethandrolone in 1953.<!--
 --><ref name="maisel"/>

In December 1954, Rock began the first studies of the ovulation-suppressing potential of 5–50&nbsp;mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5–25 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his infertility patients in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. Norethindrone or norethynodrel 5&nbsp;mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10&nbsp;mg and higher doses of norethindrone or norethynodrel suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding and led to a 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's norethynodrel for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's norethindrone's very slight androgenicity in animal tests.<!--

===Development of an effective combined oral contraceptive===
Norethynodrel (and norethindrone) were subsequently discovered to be contaminated with a small percentage of the estrogen [[mestranol]] (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the norethynodrel in Rock's 1954–5 study containing 4–7% mestranol. When further purifying norethynodrel to contain less than 1% mestranol led to breakthrough bleeding, it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with breakthrough bleeding, in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1956. The norethynodrel and mestranol combination was given the proprietary name [[Enovid]].<!--

===Public availability===

==== United States ====
On June 10, 1957, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Enovid 10&nbsp;mg (9.85&nbsp;mg norethynodrel and 150&nbsp;µg mestranol) for menstrual disorders, based on data from its use by more than 600 women. Numerous additional contraceptive trials showed Enovid at 10, 5, and 2.5&nbsp;mg doses to be highly effective. On July 23, 1959, [[G.D. Searle & Company|Searle]] filed a supplemental application to add contraception as an approved indication for 10, 5, and 2.5&nbsp;mg doses of Enovid. The FDA refused to consider the application until Searle agreed to withdraw the lower dosage forms from the application. On May 9, 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10&nbsp;mg for contraceptive use, and did so on June 23, 1960. At that point, Enovid 10&nbsp;mg had been in general use for three years and, by conservative estimate, at least half a million women had used it.<!--

Although FDA-approved for contraceptive use, Searle never marketed Enovid 10&nbsp;mg as a contraceptive. Eight months later, on February 15, 1961, the FDA approved Enovid 5&nbsp;mg for contraceptive use. In July 1961, Searle finally began marketing Enovid 5&nbsp;mg (5&nbsp;mg norethynodrel and 75&nbsp;µg mestranol) to physicians as a contraceptive.<!--

Although the FDA approved the first oral contraceptive in 1960, contraceptives were not available to married women in all states until ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' in 1965 and were not available to unmarried women in all states until ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' in 1972.<!--

The first published case report of a [[blood clot]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] in a woman using Enavid (Enovid 10&nbsp;mg in the U.S.) at a dose of 20&nbsp;mg/day did not appear until November 1961, four years after its approval, by which time it had been used by over one million women.<!--

Before the mid-1960s, the United Kingdom did not require pre-marketing approval of drugs. The British [[Family Planning Association]] (FPA) through its clinics was then the primary provider of family planning services in Britain and provided only contraceptives that were on its Approved List of Contraceptives (established in 1934). In 1957, Searle began marketing Enavid (Enovid 10&nbsp;mg in the U.S.) for menstrual disorders. Also in 1957, the FPA established a Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control (CIFC) to test and monitor oral contraceptives which began animal testing of oral contraceptives and in 1960 and 1961 began three large clinical trials in [[Birmingham]], [[Slough]], and [[London]].<!--

Two main objections raised by the association were safety concerns over long-term use of the Pill, and concerns that the Pill use would lead to diminished use of condoms and thereby potentially increase [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) rates.<!--

The Pill was approved for use in June 1999. According to estimates, only 1.3 percent of 28 million Japanese females use the Pill, compared with 15.6 percent in the United States. The Pill prescription guidelines the government endorsed require Pill users to visit a doctor every three months for pelvic examinations and undergo tests for sexually transmitted diseases and uterine cancer. In the United States and Europe, in contrast, an annual or bi-annual clinic visit is standard for Pill users. However, as far back as 2007, many Japanese [[OBGYN]]s now only require a yearly visit for pill users, with the tri-annual visits only recommended to those who are older or at increased risk of side effects.<!--

==Society and culture==
The Pill was approved by the FDA in the early 1960s; its use spread rapidly in the late part of that decade, generating an enormous social impact. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine placed the pill on its cover in April, 1967.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101670407,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: The Pill |publisher=Time.com |date=April 7, 1967 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> In the first place, it was more effective than most previous reversible methods of birth control, giving women unprecedented control over their fertility.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Its use was separate from intercourse, requiring no special preparations at the time of sexual activity that might interfere with spontaneity or sensation, and the choice to take the Pill was a private one. This combination of factors served to make the Pill immensely popular within a few years of its introduction.<ref name="asbell"/><ref name="watkins"/>
Claudia Goldin, among others, argue that this new contraceptive technology was a key player in forming women's modern economic role, in that it prolonged the age at which women first married allowing them to invest in education and other forms of human capital as well as generally become more career-oriented. Soon after the birth control pill was legalized, there was a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence Katz |year=2002 |title=The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women's Career and Marriage Decisions |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=730–770 |doi=10.1086/340778}}</ref> From an economic point of view, the birth control pill reduced the cost of staying in school. The ability to control fertility without sacrificing sexual relationships allowed women to make long term educational and career plans.

Because the Pill was so effective, and soon so widespread, it also heightened the debate about the moral and health consequences of [[pre-marital sex]] and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]''. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex.<ref>{{Cite book| author=George Weigel | title=The Courage to Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Renewal of the Church | year=2002 | publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>

The [[United States Senate]] began hearings on the Pill in 1970 and there were different viewpoints heard from medical professionals. Dr. Michael Newton, President of the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said:
<blockquote>
"The evidence is not yet clear that these still do in fact cause cancer or related to it. The FDA Advisory Committee made comments about this, that if there wasn't enough evidence to indicate whether or not these pills were related to the development of cancer, and I think that's still thin; you have to be cautious about them, but I don't think there is clear evidence, either one way or the other, that they do or don't cause cancer."<ref name="UPI">{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title |title=1970 Year in Review |work=UPI}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Another physician, Dr. Roy Hertz of the [[Population Council]], said that anyone who takes this should know of "our knowledge and ignorance in these matters" and that all women should be made aware of this so she can decide to take the Pill or not.<ref name="UPI"/>

The [[Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] at the time, [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]] announced the federal government had accepted a compromise warning statement which would accompany all sales of birth control pills.<ref name="UPI"/>

At the same time, society was beginning to take note of the impact of the Pill on traditional gender roles. Women now did not have to choose between a relationship and a career; singer [[Loretta Lynn]] commented on this in her 1974 album with a song entitled "[[The Pill (song)|The Pill]]", which told the story of a married woman's use of the drug to liberate herself from her traditional role as wife and mother.

A woman using COCPs excretes from her [[urine]] and [[feces]] natural [[estrogen]]s, [[estrone]] (E1) and [[estradiol]] (E2), and synthetic estrogen [[ethinylestradiol]] (EE2).<ref name="williams">{{Cite journal|author=Williams RJ, Johnson AC, Smith JJ, Kanda R |year=2003 |title=Steroid estrogens profiles along river stretches arising from sewage treatment works discharges |journal=Environ Sci Technol |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=1744–50 |pmid=12775044 | doi = 10.1021/es0202107}}</ref>

A review of [[activated sludge|activated sludge plant]] performance found estrogen removal rates varied considerably but averaged 78% for estrone, 91% for estradiol, and 76% for ethinylestradiol ([[estriol]] effluent concentrations are between those of estrone and estradiol, but estriol is a much less potent endocrine disruptor to fish).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Johnson AC, Williams RJ, Simpson P, Kanda R |year=2007 |title=What difference might sewage treatment performance make to endocrine disruption in rivers? |journal=Environ Pollut |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=194–202 |pmid=17030080 | doi = 10.1016/j.envpol.2006.08.032}}</ref>
