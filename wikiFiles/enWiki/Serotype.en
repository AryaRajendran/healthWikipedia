[[File:Serotypes – Antibody versus antigen.svg|thumb|right|300px|Two '''serotypes''' 1a and 1b with [[antigens]] 2a and 2b on surface.]]
'''Serotype''' or '''serovar''' refers to distinct variations within a species of bacteria or viruses or among immune cells of different individuals. These [[microorganisms]], [[virus]]es, or [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s are classified together based on their cell surface [[antigen]]s, allowing the epidemiologic classification of organisms to the sub-species level.<ref name=Barron>{{cite book | author =  Baron EJ | title = Classification.

The American Heritage Medical Dictionary. 2007. Houghton Mifflin Company 24 Oct. 2009 http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/serovar</ref> A group of serovars with common antigens is called a '''serogroup'''.

Serotyping often plays an essential role in determining species and subspecies. The ''[[Salmonella]]'' [[genus]] of [[bacteria]], for example, has been determined to have over 4400 serotypes, including ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'' serovar Typhimurium, ''S. enterica'' serovar Typhi, and ''S. enterica'' serovar Dublin.<ref name=Sherris /> ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', the [[species]] of bacteria that causes [[cholera]], has over 200 serotypes, based on cell antigens. Only two of them have been observed to produce the potent enterotoxin that results in cholera: 0:1 and 0:139.

Serotypes were discovered by the American microbiologist [[Rebecca Lancefield]] in 1933.<ref name=Lancefield_1933>{{cite journal | author = Lancefield RC | title = A SEROLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION OF HUMAN AND OTHER GROUPS OF HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI |journal=J Exp Med |year=1933 |volume=57 | issue = 4 | pmid = 19870148 |pages=571–95 | pmc = 2132252 |url= http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/4/571 | doi = 10.1084/jem.57.4.571 | format = abstract}}</ref>

==Role in organ transplantation==

The [[immune system]] is capable of discerning a cell as being 'self' or 'non-self' according to that cell's serotype. In humans, that serotype is largely determined by [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA), the human version of the [[major histocompatibility complex]]. Cells determined to be non-self are usually recognized by the immune system as foreign, causing an immune response, such as [[hemagglutination]]. Serotypes differ widely between individuals; therefore, if cells from one human (or animal) are introduced into another random human, those cells are oftentimes determined to be non-self because they do not match the self-serotype. For this reason, transplants between genetically non-identical humans often induce a problematic immune response in the recipient, leading to [[transplant rejection]]. In some situations this effect can be reduced by serotyping both recipient and potential donors to determine the closest HLA match.<ref>Christoph Frohn, Lutz Fricke, Jan-Christoph Puchta, and Holger Kirchner. The effect of HLA-C matching on acute renal transplant rejection. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 16: 355-360. http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/2/355</ref>
