'''Cystinosis''' is a [[lysosomal storage disease]] characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the [[amino acid]] [[cystine]].<ref name="CystinosiNEJM">{{cite journal|last=A. Gahl|first=William|coauthors=Jess G. Thoene and Jerry A. Schneider|title=Cystinosis|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2002|volume=347|issue=2|pages=111–121|pmid=12110740|accessdate=31 march 2011|doi=10.1056/NEJMra020552}}</ref> It is a [[genetic disorder]] that typically follows an [[dominance relationship|autosomal recessive]] [[inheritance]] pattern.  Cystinosis is the most common cause of [[Fanconi syndrome]] in the pediatric age group.  Fanconi syndrome occurs when the function of cells in [[renal tubule]]s are impaired, leading to abnormal amounts of [[carbohydrate]]s and [[amino acid]]s in the [[urine]], excessive urination, and low blood levels of [[potassium]] and [[phosphate]]s.

==Diagnosis==
Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder<ref>[http://children.webmd.com/cystinosis-10731 Cystinosis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that causes an accumulation of the [[amino acid]] [[cystine]] within cells, forming crystals that can build up and damage the cells. These crystals negatively affect many systems in the body, especially the kidneys and eyes.<ref name="CystinosiNEJM"/>

The accumulation is caused by abnormal transport of cystine from [[lysosome]]s, resulting in a massive intra-lysosomal cystine accumulation in tissues. Via an as yet unknown mechanism, lysosomal cystine appears to amplify and alter [[apoptosis]] in such a way that cells die inappropriately, leading to loss of renal epithelial cells. This results in renal [[Fanconi syndrome]],<ref name=Fanconi>{{cite journal|last=Howard G. WORTHEN|coauthors=Robert A. GOOD|title=The de Toni-Fanconi Syndrome with Cystinosis|journal=AMA J Dis Child.|year=1958|volume=95|issue=6|pages=653–688|pmid=1353216|accessdate=31 March 2011|first1=N}}</ref> and similar loss in other tissues can account for the short stature, retinopathy, and other features of the disease.

Definitive diagnosis and treatment monitoring are most often performed through measurement of white blood cell cystine level using tandem mass spectrometry.

===Symptoms===

There are three distinct types of cystinosis each with slightly different symptoms: nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis. Infants affected by nephropathic cystinosis initially exhibit poor growth and particular [[kidney]] problems (sometimes called renal [[Fanconi syndrome]]). The kidney problems lead to the loss of important minerals, salts, fluids, and other nutrients. The loss of nutrients not only impairs growth, but may result in soft, bowed bones ([[hypophosphatemic rickets]]), especially in the legs. The nutrient imbalances in the body lead to increased urination, thirst, dehydration, and abnormally acidic blood ([[acidosis]]).

By about age two, cystine crystals may also be present in the [[cornea]]. The buildup of these crystals in the eye causes an increased sensitivity to light ([[photophobia]]). Without treatment, children with cystinosis are likely to experience complete kidney failure by about age ten. Other signs and symptoms that may occur in untreated patients include muscle deterioration, blindness, inability to swallow, impaired sweating, decreased hair and skin pigmentation, [[diabetes]], and [[thyroid]] and [[nervous system]] problems.

The signs and symptoms of intermediate cystinosis are the same as nephropathic cystinosis, but they occur at a later age. Intermediate cystinosis typically begins to affect individuals around age twelve to fifteen. Malfunctioning kidneys and corneal crystals are the main initial features of this disorder. If intermediate cystinosis is left untreated, complete kidney failure will occur, but usually not until the late teens to mid twenties.

People with non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis do not usually experience growth impairment or kidney malfunction. The only symptom is photophobia due to cystine crystals in the cornea.

Research into cystinosis is currently being conducted at the [[University of California San Diego]], [[University of Michigan]], [[Tulane University School of Medicine]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], as well as at [[Robert Gordon University]] in Aberdeen, Scotland, [[University of Sunderland]], UK, and the [[Necker Hospital]] in [[Paris]].

===Crystal morphology and identification===
Cystine crystals are hexagonal in shape and are colorless. They are not found often in alkaline urine due to their high solubility. The colorless crystals can be difficult to distinguish from uric acid crystals which are also hexagonal.    Under polarized examination you will see a birefringent of crystals with a polarization color interference.<ref name=ucc11ds>{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Daniel|title=Cystine|url=http://www.texascollaborative.org/spencer_urinalysis/ds_act3-1_03_crystals.htm#25|work=CRYSTALS|publisher=Urinalysis (Texas Collaborative

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Cystinosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Cystinosis occurs due to a mutation in the gene [[CTNS (gene)|CTNS]], located on [[chromosome 17]], which codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal cystine transporter.  Symptoms are first seen at about 3 to 18 months of age with profound [[polyuria]] (excessive urination), followed by poor growth, [[photophobia]], and ultimately [[renal failure|kidney failure]] by age 6 years in the nephropathic form.

All forms of cystinosis (nephropathic, juvenile and ocular) are [[autosomal recessive]], which means that the trait is located on an autosomal gene, and an individual who inherits two copies of the gene - one from both parents - will have the disorder. There is a 25% risk of having a child with the disorder, when both parents are carriers of an autosomal recessive trait. 

Cystinosis affects approximately 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cystinosis on Genetic home reference|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=cystinosis}}</ref>  and there are only around 2,000 known individuals with cystinosis in the world.  The incidence is higher in the province of [[Brittany]], [[France]], where the disorder affects 1 in 26,000 individuals.<ref name=Brittany>{{cite journal|last=Kalatzis|first=V|coauthors=Cherqui S, Jean G, Cordier B, Cochat P, Broyer M, Antignac C|title=Characterization of a putative founder mutation that accounts for the high incidence of cystinosis in Brittany|journal=J Am Soc Nephrol|year=2001|month=October|volume=12|issue=10|pages=2170–2174|pmid=11562417|url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/12/10/2170.long|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Cystinosis is normally treated with a drug called cysteamine (brand name Cystagon).<ref name=GahlNEJ>{{cite journal|last=William A. Gahl|coauthors=George F. Reed, Ph.D., Jess G. Thoene, M.D., Joseph D. Schulman, M.D., William B. Rizzo, M.D., Adam J. Jonas, M.D., Daniel W. Denman, M.A., James J. Schlesselman, Ph.D., Brian J. Corden, M.D., and Jerry A. Schneider, M.D.|title=Cysteamine Therapy for Children with Nephropathic Cystinosis|journal=N Engl J Med|year=1987|volume=316|issue=16|pages=971–977|pmid=3550461|doi=10.1056/NEJM198704163161602|first1=William A.}}</ref>  The administration of cysteamine can reduce the intracellular cystine content. Cysteamine concentrates inside the lysosomes and reacts with cystine to form both cysteine and a cysteine-cysteamine complex, which are able to leave the lysosomes. When administered regularly, cysteamine decreases the amount of cystine stored in lysosomes and correlates with conservation of renal function and improved growth.<ref name=GahlNEJ/> Cysteamine eyedrops remove the cystine crystals in the cornea that can cause photophobia if left unchecked.  Patients with cystinosis are also often given [[sodium citrate]] to treat the blood acidosis, as well as potassium and phosphorus supplements. If the kidneys become significantly impaired or fail, then treatment must be begun to ensure continued survival, up to and including [[renal transplantation]].
