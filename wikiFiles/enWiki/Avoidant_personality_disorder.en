'''Avoidant personality disorder''' ('''AvPD'''), also known as '''anxious personality disorder''',<ref name="avoidant">[http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-pe08.html Avoidant personality disorder - [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] 10th Revision ([[ICD-10]])]</ref> is a Cluster C [[personality disorder]] recognized in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] handbook as afflicting a person when they display a [[wiktionary:pervasive|pervasive]] pattern of [[social inhibition]], feelings of inadequacy, [[Fear of negative evaluation|extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation]], and avoidance of [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]].<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/avoidantpd.htm Avoidant personality disorder] - [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref>

People with avoidant personality disorder often consider themselves to be [[social skill|socially inept]] or personally unappealing and avoid social interaction for fear of being ridiculed, [[Humiliation|humiliated]], rejected, or disliked. Avoidant personality disorder is usually first noticed in early adulthood. Childhood emotional neglect and peer group rejection (e.g. [[bullying]]) are both associated with an increased risk for the development of AvPD.

There is controversy as to whether avoidant personality disorder is a distinct disorder from [[social anxiety disorder|generalized social phobia]] and it is contended by some that they are merely different conceptualisations of the same disorder, where avoidant personality disorder may represent the more severe form.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reich |first1=James |title=Avoidant personality disorder and its relationship to social phobia |journal=Current Psychiatry Reports |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=89–93 |year=2009 |pmid=19187715 |doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0014-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huppert |first1=Jonathan D. |last2=Strunk |first2=Daniel R. |last3=Ledley |first3=Deborah Roth |last4=Davidson |first4=Jonathan R.

==History==
The avoidant personality has been described in several sources as far back as the early 1900s, although it was not so named for some time. [[Switzerland|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] described patients who exhibited signs of avoidant personality disorder in his 1911 work ''Dementia Praecox: Or the Group of Schizophrenias''.<ref name=millon1995>{{Cite book

==Signs and symptoms==
People with avoidant personality disorder are preoccupied with their own shortcomings and form relationships with others only if they believe they will not be rejected. Loss and rejection are so painful that these individuals will choose to be lonely rather than risk trying to connect with others.
* Hypersensitivity to [[Social rejection|rejection]]/[[criticism]]
* Self-imposed [[social isolation]]
* Extreme [[shyness]] or [[social anxiety|anxiety]] in social situations, though the person feels a strong desire for close relationships<ref name=line>{{cite web | title =Avoidant personality disorder | publisher= Healthline Networks | work =Avoidant personality disorder | url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/avoidant-personality-disorder | year = 2003 | accessdate=2006-02-26 | author =Gary Gilles M.A., Paula Ford-Martin M.A.}}</ref>
* Avoids physical contact because it has been associated with an unpleasant or painful stimulus
* Feelings of inadequacy
* Severe low [[self-esteem]]
* [[Self-loathing]]
* [[Mistrust]] of others
* [[Personal boundaries|Emotional distancing]] related to intimacy
* Highly [[self-conscious]]
* [[Self-criticism|Self-critical]] about their problems relating to others
* Problems in occupational functioning
* Lonely [[self-perception]], although others may find the relationship with them meaningful
* Feeling [[Inferiority complex|inferior]] to others
* In some more extreme cases — [[agoraphobia]]
* Utilizes [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] as a form of [[escapism]] and to interrupt painful thoughts<ref name=sperry /><ref>[http://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/avoidant-personality-disorder/avoidant-personality-disorder/menu-id-62/  Avoidant Personality Disorder], Real Mental Health, Inc.</ref>

Causes of avoidant personality disorder are not clearly defined and may be influenced by a combination of social, genetic, and psychological factors. The disorder may be related to [[temperament]]al factors that are inherited.<ref name="eggum" /><ref name=emedicine>{{Cite web

==Diagnosis==
===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]] lists avoidant personality disorder as ''({{ICD10|F|60|6|f|60}}) anxious (avoidant) personality disorder''.<ref name="avoidant"/> It is characterized by at least four of the following:<ref>[http://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf WHO.int]</ref>
# persistent and pervasive feelings of tension and apprehension;
# belief that one is socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others;
# excessive preoccupation with being criticized or rejected in social situations;
# unwillingness to become involved with people unless certain of being liked;
# restrictions in lifestyle because of need to have physical security;
# avoidance of social or occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fear of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.
:Associated features may include hypersensitivity to rejection and criticism.

It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfy a set of [[Personality_disorder#Diagnosis|general personality disorder criteria]].

===American Psychiatric Association===
The DSM-IV-TR also has an Avoidant Personality Disorder diagnosis. It refers in general to a widespread pattern of inhibition around people, feeling inadequate and being very sensitive to being evaluated negatively, since early adulthood and occurring in a range of situations. In addition, four of seven specific criteria should be met, which are:

# Avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact, because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection
# Is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked
# Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed
# Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations
# Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy
# Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others
# Is unusually reluctant to take personal risk or to engage in any new activities because they may prove embarrassing

===Other===
Individual researchers and clinicians also do work on personality types related to the official diagnoses. Psychologist [[Theodore Millon]] has proposed four subtypes of avoidant personality disorder.<ref name=millon2>{{Cite book

These are a 'conflicted avoidant' - including negativistic features, alleged to feel [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] towards themselves and others; 'hypersensitive avoidant' - claimed to include [[paranoid]] features to a lesser extent than paranoid personality disorder; 'phobic avoidant' - including [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]] features; 'self-deserting avoidant' - including [[depressive personality disorder|depressive]] features.

Earlier theorists proposed a personality disorder with a combination of features from [[borderline personality disorder]] and avoidant personality disorder, called "avoidant-borderline mixed personality" (AvPD/BPD).<ref>Kantor, M. (1993, revised 2003). Distancing: A guide to avoidance and avoidant personality disorder. Westport, Conn: Praeger Publishers.</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
Research suggests that people with avoidant personality disorder, in common with sufferers of chronic [[social anxiety disorder]] (also called social phobia), excessively monitor their own internal reactions when they are involved in social interaction. However, unlike social phobics they also excessively monitor the reactions of the people with whom they are interacting. The extreme tension created by this monitoring may account for the hesitant speech and [[taciturn]]ity of many people with avoidant personality disorder; they are so preoccupied with monitoring themselves and others that producing fluent speech is difficult.

According to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], avoidant personality disorder must be differentiated from dependent, paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders.<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Anxiety disorders. In Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev., pp. 450–456). Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association.</ref>

===Comorbidity===
Avoidant personality disorder is reported to be especially prevalent in people with [[anxiety disorder]]s, although estimates of [[comorbidity]] vary widely due to differences in (among others) diagnostic instruments. Research suggests that approximately 10–50% of people who have [[panic disorder]] with [[agoraphobia]] have avoidant personality disorder, as well as about 20–40% of people who have [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] (social anxiety disorder).

Some studies report prevalence rates of up to 45% among people with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and up to 56% of those with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].<ref>Van Velzen, C. J. M. (2002). ''Social phobia and personality disorders: Comorbidity and treatment issues.'' Groningen: University Library Groningen. ([http://irs.ub.rug.nl/ppn/240921941 online version])</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of avoidant personality disorder can employ various techniques, such as [[social skills training]], [[cognitive therapy]], exposure treatment to gradually increase social contacts, [[group therapy]] for practicing social skills, and sometimes [[pharmacology|drug therapy]].<ref>Comer, R. J. (1996). Fundamentals of abnormal psychology. Avoidant personality disorder, pp.428-430. Third edition. New York: Worth.</ref> A key issue in treatment is gaining and keeping the patient's trust, since people with avoidant personality disorder will often start to avoid treatment sessions if they distrust the therapist or fear rejection. The primary purpose of both individual therapy and social skills group training is for individuals with avoidant personality disorder to begin challenging their exaggerated negative beliefs about themselves.<ref>{{cite web | author=Eckleberry, Sharon C. | title=Dual Diagnosis and the Avoidant Personality Disorder | date=2000-03-25 | work=The Dual Diagnosis Pages: From Our Desk | url=http://www.toad.net/~arcturus/dd/avoid.htm | accessdate=2007-02-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061216233724/http://www.toad.net/~arcturus/dd/avoid.htm|archivedate=2006-12-16}}</ref>
