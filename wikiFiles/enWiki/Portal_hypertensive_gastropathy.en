'''Portal hypertensive gastropathy''' refers to changes in the [[mucosa]] of the [[stomach]] in patients with [[portal hypertension]]; by far the most common cause of this is [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].  These changes in the mucosa include [[friability]] of the mucosa and the presence of [[ectasia|ectatic]]  blood vessels at the surface.  Patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy may experience bleeding from the [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding|stomach]], which may uncommonly manifest itself in [[hematemesis|vomiting blood]] or [[melena]]; however, portal hypertension may cause several other more common sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such as [[esophageal varices]] and [[gastric varices]].  On endoscopy evaluation of the stomach, this condition shows a characteristic mosaic or "snake-skin" appearance to the mucosa of the stomach.

==Pathogenesis==
Several studies have found that patients with portal hypertension develop increased blood flow to the stomach.<!--

==Clinical findings==
Most patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy have either a stable or improving course in the appearance of the gastropathy on [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|endoscopy]].  However, according to retrospective data, roughly one in seven patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy will develop bleeding (either acute or chronic) attributable to the gastropathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Primignani M, Carpinelli L, Preatoni P, ''et al.'' |title=Natural history of portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with liver cirrhosis. The New Italian Endoscopic Club for the study and treatment of esophageal varices (NIEC) |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=181–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10889167 |doi=}}</ref>  Patients with chronic bleeding will usually come to the attention of the medical system because of [[anemia]].

The diagnosis of portal hypertensive gastropathy is usually made on endoscopy.  The usual appearance of portal hypertensive gastropathy on endoscopy is a mosaic-like or reticular pattern in the mucosa.  Red spots may or may not be present.  The pattern is usually seen throughout the stomach.<ref name=PHGrev/>  A similar pattern can be seen with a related condition called [[gastric antral vascular ectasia]] (GAVE), or [[watermelon]] stomach.  However, in GAVE, the ectatic blood vessels are more commonly found in the [[antrum]] or lower part of the stomach.<ref name=PHGrev/>

==Treatment==
[[Image:Gastric_antral_vascular_ectasia_(before_and_after).png|thumb|right|Argon plasma coagulation, seen here to treat [[gastric antral vascular ectasia]], has also been used to treat bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy]]

===Medications===
Several treatment options have been developed for portal hypertensive gastropathy.  The first is the use of [[beta-blockers]], which reduce portal pressures.  Non-selective beta blockers (such as [[propranolol]] and [[nadolol]] have been used to decrease the pressure of the portal vein in patients with [[esophageal varices]], and have been shown to regress portal hypertensive gastropathy that has been worsened by medical treatment of varices.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lo GH, Lai KH, Cheng JS, ''et al.'' |title=The effects of endoscopic variceal ligation and propranolol on portal hypertensive gastropathy: a prospective, controlled trial |journal=Gastrointest. Endosc. |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=579–84 |year=2001 |pmid=11323582 |doi=10.1067/mge.2001.114062}}</ref>  [[Propranolol]] has also been evaluated in patients with chronic cirrhosis and portal hypertensive gastropathy <ref>{{cite journal |author=Pérez-Ayuso RM, Piqué JM, Bosch J, ''et al.'' |title=Propranolol in prevention of recurrent bleeding from severe portal hypertensive gastropathy in cirrhosis |journal=Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8755 |pages=1431–4 |year=1991 |pmid=1675316 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)93125-S}}</ref>  Other medications that primarily treat bleeding, including anti-fibrinolytic medications such as [[tranexamic acid]] have also been used in case reports of patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCormick PA, Ooi H, Crosbie O |title=Tranexamic acid for severe bleeding gastric antral vascular ectasia in cirrhosis |journal=Gut |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=750–2 |year=1998 |pmid=9659175 |doi= 10.1136/gut.42.5.750|pmc=1727106}}</ref>  These medications work by stabilizing deposits of [[fibrin]] at sites that ordinarily would bleed.

Finally, [[octreotide]], an analogue of [[somatostatin]] that leads to vasoconstriction of the portal circulation, can be used for active bleeding due to portal hypertensive gastropathy.<ref name=Rev2>{{cite journal |author=Garcia N, Sanyal AJ |title=Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy and Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia |journal= Current treatment options in gastroenterology|volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=163–171 |year=2001 |pmid=11469974 |doi=10.1007/s11938-001-0028-0}}</ref>  [[Sucralfate]], a coating medication has also been used, but evidence is from animal models.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Geoffroy P, Duchateau A, Thiéfin G, Zeitoun P |title=Effects of propranolol and sucralfate on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in chronic portal hypertensive rats |journal=J.

===Procedural===
Portal hypertensive gastropathy can also be treated with endoscopic treatment delivered through a fibre-optic camera into the stomach.  [[Argon plasma coagulation]] and electrocautery have both been used to stop bleeding from ectatic vessels, and to attempt to obliterate the vessels, but have limited utility if the disease is diffuse.<ref name=Rev2/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sato T, Yamazaki K, Toyota J, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of argon plasma coagulation for gastric antral vascular ectasia associated with chronic liver disease |journal=Hepatol. Res. |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=121–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15967712 |doi=10.1016/j.hepres.2005.04.004}}</ref>

[[Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]] procedures, or TIPS involve decompressing the portal vein by shunting a portal venule to a lower pressure systemic venule, under guidance with [[fluoroscopy]].  Since it treats the root cause of portal hypertension gastropathy, it has been putatively used for the condition.  The literature reports suggest both regression of portal hypertensive gastropathy on [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] images and improvement in bleeding after TIPS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Urata J, Yamashita Y, Tsuchigame T, ''et al.'' |title=The effects of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt on portal hypertensive gastropathy |journal=J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1061–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9835325 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1746.1998.tb00571.x}}</ref>

Finally, [[cryotherapy]] involves the use of pressurized [[carbon dioxide]] administered through the endoscope to freeze and destroy tissue in a focal area.  It is being studied for the treatment of portal hypertensive gastropathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clarke JO, Thuluvath PJ |title=Endoscopic frontiers in the field of hepatology |journal=Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=101–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17415347 |doi=}}</ref>

==Similar conditions==
Congestion of the mucosa in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract can also be seen in portal hypertension.  When the condition involves the colon, it is termed ''portal hypertensive colopathy''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bini EJ, Lascarides CE, Micale PL, Weinshel EH |title=Mucosal abnormalities of the colon in patients with portal hypertension: an endoscopic study |journal=Gastrointest.
