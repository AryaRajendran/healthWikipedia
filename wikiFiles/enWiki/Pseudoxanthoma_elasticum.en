==Signs and symptoms==
Usually, pseudoxanthoma elasticum affects the skin first, often in childhood but frequently later. Small, yellowish papular lesions form and cutaneous laxity mainly affects the neck, [[Armpit|axillae]] (armpits), groin, and flexural creases (the inside parts of the elbows and knees). Skin may become lax and redundant. Many individuals have "oblique mental creases" (diagonal grooves of the chin).<ref name=Chassaing/>

PXE first affects the retina through a dimpling of the [[Bruch's membrane|Bruch membrane]] (a thin membrane separating the blood vessel-rich layer from the pigmented layer of the [[retina]]), that is only visible during [[ophthalmologic]] examinations.  This is called [[peau d'orange]] (a French term meaning that the retina resembles the skin of an orange). Eventually the mineralization of the elastic fibers in the Bruch membrane create cracks ([[angioid streaks]]) that radiate out from the optic nerve. Angioid streaks themselves do not cause distortion of vision, even if they cross into the foveal area. This symptom is present almost all PXE patients and is usually noticed a few years after the onset of cutaneous [[wikt:lesion|lesions]]. These cracks may allow small blood vessels that were originally held back by Bruch's membrane to penetrate the retina. These blood vessels sometimes leak, and it's these retinal [[wikt:hemorrhage|hemorrhages]] that may lead to the loss of central vision. Vision loss is a major issue in many PXE patients.<ref name=Chassaing/><ref name=Finger/>

PXE may affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. In the digestive tract, the principal symptom is [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], usually from the [[stomach]]. This occurs in very small number of patients. In the circulatory system, [[intermittent claudication]] (leg pain during walking which resolves at rest) is a prominent feature, although at later stages [[coronary artery disease]] may develop, leading to [[angina pectoris|angina]] and [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) may occur.<ref name=Chassaing/>

==Classification==
The diagnostic criteria for PXE are the typical skin biopsy appearance and the presence of [[angioid streaks]] in the retina. Other systems have become somewhat outdated by the discovery of the ''ABCC6'' mutations.<ref name=Chassaing/>

==Pathophysiology==
In PXE, there is mineralization (accumulation of [[calcium in biology|calcium]] and other minerals) and fragmentation of the [[elastin]]-containing fibers in [[connective tissue]], but primarily in the midlaminar layer of the dermis, Bruch's membrane and the midsized [[artery|arteries]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gheduzzi D, Sammarco R, Quaglino D, Bercovitch L, Terry S, Taylor W, Ronchetti I |title=Extracutaneous ultrastructural alterations in pseudoxanthoma elasticum |journal=Ultrastructural pathology |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=375–84 |year=2003 |pmid=14660276 |doi=10.1080/716100800}}</ref> Recent studies hypothesize that PXE is a metabolic disease, and that its features arise because metabolites of vitamin K cannot reach peripheral tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li Q, Jiang Q, Pfendner E, Váradi A, Uitto J |title=Pseudoxanthoma elasticum: clinical phenotypes, molecular genetics and putative pathomechanisms |journal=Exp.

==Genetics==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Pseudoxanthoma elasticum has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]]

Although there have been reports of [[Dominance relationship|autosomal dominant]] inheritance, the inheritance is typically autosomal recessive (both parents need to be carriers, and there is a 25% chance that a child will inherit ''both'' abnormal copies of the gene and therefore develop the condition).<ref name=Chassaing/>

Strong genetic linkage was found with mutations in the ''[[ABCC6]]'' gene, which codes for the MRP6 protein, but the exact mechanism by which this protein (which is a membrane transporter from the large [[ATP-binding cassette transporter genes|ATP-binding cassette transporter]] family) influences the disease course is unknown; the protein is expressed in most organs, but mainly in the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]. It is unclear in what way this would lead to abnormalities in skin, eyes and blood vessels. It is thought that particular mutations do not cause a more severe or less severe form of the disease. Given the variations in age of onset and severity it is likely that other unknown risk factors (genetic and dietary) may be involved.<ref name=Chassaing/> One study suggested that mutations causing total absence of an MRP6 protein caused a more severe disease,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schulz V, Hendig D, Szliska C, Götting C, Kleesiek K |title=Novel mutations in the ABCC6 gene of German patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=367–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16392638 |doi=10.1353/hub.2005.0054}}</ref> but this could not be confirmed in a subsequent case series.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pfendner EG |title=Mutation detection in the ABCC6 gene and genotype-phenotype analysis in a large international case series affected by pseudoxanthoma elasticum |journal=J.

Premature [[atherosclerosis]] is also associated with mutations in the ''[[ABCC6]]'' gene, even in those without PXE.<ref name="pmid12176944">{{cite journal |author=Trip MD |title=Frequent mutation in the ABCC6 gene (R1141X) is associated with a strong increase in the prevalence of coronary artery disease |journal=Circulation |volume=106 |issue=7 |pages=773–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12176944 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000028420.27813.C0| url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/7/773 |author-separator=, |author2=Smulders YM |author3=Wegman JJ |display-authors=3 |last4=Hu |first4=X |last5=Boer |first5=JM |last6=Ten Brink |first6=JB |last7=Zwinderman |first7=AH |last8=Kastelein |first8=JJ |last9=Feskens |first9=EJ}}</ref> A syndrome almost indistinguishable from hereditary PXE has been described in patients with [[hemoglobinopathy|hemoglobinopathies]] ([[sickle-cell disease]] and [[thalassemia]]) through a poorly understood mechanism.<ref name=Chassaing/> In addition, there appears to be another PXE-like syndrome with a similar phenotype but as a result of problems with another gene, [[gamma-glutamyl carboxylase]].<ref name="pmid17110937">{{cite journal |author=Vanakker OM, Martin L, Gheduzzi D, Leroy BP, Loeys BL, Guerci VI, Matthys D, Terry SF, Coucke PJ, Pasquali-Ronchetti I, De Paepe A.|title=Pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like phenotype with cutis laxa and multiple coagulation factor deficiency represents a separate genetic entity |journal=J Invest Dermatol. |volume=127 |issue=3 |pages=581–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17110937 |doi=10.1038/sj.jid.5700610| url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v127/n3/full/5700610a.html}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no treatment that directly interferes with the disease process, although dietary restriction of calcium has been tried with limited results.<ref name=Chassaing/> For excessive areas of skin, [[plastic surgery]] may be needed.  For the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, [[laser photocoagulation]] and [[photodynamic therapy]] may be used; injections with [[triamcinolone]] have shown limited effect. Antiangiogenic drugs such as [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin) and [[ranibizumab]] (Lucentis) have been effective, similar to its efficacy in [[macular degeneration|age-related macular degeneration]].<ref name=Finger/> Cardiovascular disease is treated as in individuals without PXE. Some recommend avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that increase bleeding risk, such as [[aspirin]], and [[ibuprofen]].<ref name=Chassaing/>

==Epidemiology==
The reported prevalence of pseudoxanthoma elasticum is about 1:25,000. Females are twice as likely to be affected as males. The disease occurs in all ethnicities, but [[Afrikaner]]s are more likely to have PXE as a result of a [[founder effect]] (i.e. it was relatively prevalent in the small group of people from whom most Afrikaners descend).<ref name=Chassaing/>

==History==
The first description of PXE that distinguished it from other [[xanthoma]]tous conditions was by Dr Ferdinand-Jean Darrier in 1896.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Darrier FJ | year=1896 | title=Pseudoxanthoma elasticum | journal=Monatschr Prakt Dermatol | language=German | volume=23 | pages=609–17}}</ref> The eponym "Grönblad-Strandberg syndrome" is used in older literature, after two physicians who made further discoveries in the disease manifestations.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1059}}</ref>

PXE has the distinction of being the only disease for which a layperson is the inventor of the gene, ''ABCC6''. Sharon F. Terry, co-founder of PXE International with her husband, Patrick F. Terry, worked with scientists to discover and patent the gene in 2000.<ref name=LeSaux/> The Terrys' two children have pseudoxanthoma elasticum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Terry SF, Terry PF, Rauen KA, Uitto J, Bercovitch LG |title=Advocacy groups as research organizations: the PXE International example |journal=Nat.
