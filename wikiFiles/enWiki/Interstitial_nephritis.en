'''Interstitial nephritis ''' (or '''Tubulo-interstitial nephritis''') is a form of [[nephritis]] affecting the [[interstitium]] of the [[kidney]]s surrounding the [[Nephron#Renal_tubule|tubules]]. This disease can be either acute, meaning it occurs suddenly, or chronic, meaning it is ongoing and eventually ends in kidney failure.

==Etiologies==
Common causes include infection, or reaction to medication (such as an [[analgesic]] or [[antibiotic]]s such as Methicillin ([[Meticillin]]). Reaction to medications causes 71%<ref name="pmid14671029">{{cite journal |author=Baker R, Pusey C |title=The changing profile of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis |journal=Nephrol Dial Transplant |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=8–11 |year=2004 |pmid=14671029|url=http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/1/8 |doi=10.1093/ndt/gfg464}}</ref> to 92%<ref name="pmid15340098">{{cite journal |author=Clarkson M, Giblin L, O'Connell F, O'Kelly P, Walshe J, Conlon P, O'Meara Y, Dormon A, Campbell E, Donohoe J |title=Acute interstitial nephritis: clinical features and response to corticosteroid therapy |journal=Nephrol Dial Transplant |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=2778–83 |year=2004 |pmid=15340098 |doi=10.1093/ndt/gfh485}}</ref> of cases.

This disease is also caused by other diseases and toxins that do damage to the kidney.  Both acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis can be caused by a bacterial infection in the kidneys, known as [[pyelonephritis]]. The most common cause is by an allergic reaction to a drug.  The drugs that are known to cause this sort of reaction are antibiotics such as [[penicillin]] and [[cephalexin]], and [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]], such as aspirin, as well as rifampin, sulfa drugs, quinolones, diuretics, allopurinol, and phenytoin.  The time between exposure to the drug and the development of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis can be anywhere from 5 days to 5 months (fenoprofen induced).

==Diagnosis==
At times there are no symptoms of this disease, but when they do occur they are widely varied and can occur rapidly or gradually.<ref name="pmid14671029"/><ref name="pmid11473672">{{cite journal |author=Rossert J |title=Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis |journal=Kidney Int |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=804–17 |year=2001 |pmid=11473672 | url=http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v60/n2/full/4492487a.html | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.060002804.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid6604293">{{cite journal |author=Pusey C, Saltissi D, Bloodworth L, Rainford D, Christie J |title=Drug associated acute interstitial nephritis: clinical and pathological features and the response to high dose steroid therapy |journal=Q J Med |volume=52 |issue=206 |pages=194–211 |year=1983 |pmid=6604293}}</ref><ref name="pmid3779558">{{cite journal |author=Handa S |title=Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis: report of 10 cases |journal=CMAJ |volume=135 |issue=11 |pages=1278–81 |year=1986 |pmid=3779558 |pmc=1491384}}</ref><ref name="pmid2113219">{{cite journal |author=Buysen J, Houthoff H, Krediet R, Arisz L |title=Acute interstitial nephritis: a clinical and morphological study in 27 patients |journal=Nephrol Dial Transplant |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=94–9 |year=1990 |pmid=2113219}}</ref>  When caused by an allergic reaction, the symptoms of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis are fever (27% of patients),<ref name="pmid14671029"/> rash (15% of patients),<ref name="pmid14671029"/> and enlarged kidneys.  Some people experience [[dysuria]], and lower back pain.  In chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis the patient can experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss.  Other conditions that may develop include [[hyperkalemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and kidney failure.

===Blood tests===
About 23% of patients have [[eosinophilia]].<ref name="pmid14671029"/>

===Urinary findings===
Urinary findings include:
* [[Eosinophiluria]]: [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] is 67% and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] is 83%.<ref name="pmid11473672"/><ref name="pmid11020015">{{cite journal |author=Schwarz A, Krause P, Kunzendorf U, Keller F, Distler A |title=The outcome of acute interstitial nephritis risk factors for the transition from acute to chronic interstitial nephritis |journal=Clin Nephrol |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=179–90 |year=2000 |pmid=11020015}}</ref> The [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] is higher in patients with interstitial nephritis induced by [[methicillin]] or when the Hansel's stain is used.

==Treatment==
Remove the etiology such as an offending drug. [[Corticosteroids]] do not clearly help.<ref name="pmid15340098"/>
Nutrition therapy consists of adequate fluid intake, which can require several liters of extra fluid.<ref>{{cite book |coauthors= Mahan KL, Escott-Stump S |editor= Alexopolos Y |title= Krause's Food, Nutrition, & Diet Therapy|edition= 11th|publisher= Saunders |location= Philadelphia Pennsylvania |isbn= 0-7216-9784-4 |chapter= 39|page= 968 |year= 2003}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The kidneys are the only body system that are directly affected by tubulointerstitial nephritis.  Kidney function is usually reduced; the kidneys can be just slightly dysfunctional, or fail completely.

In chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, the most serious long-term effect is kidney failure.  When the proximal tube is injured, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, uric acid, and phosphate reabsorption may be reduced or changed, resulting in low bicarbonate, known as [[metabolic acidosis]], low potassium, low uric acid known as hypouricemia, and low phosphate known as hypophosphatemia.  Damage to the distal tubule may cause loss of urine-concentrating ability and [[polyuria]].

In most cases of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, the function of the kidneys will return after the harmful drug is not taken anymore, or when the underlying disease is cured by treatment.  If the illness is caused by an allergic reaction, a corticosteroid may speed the recovery kidney function; however, this is often not the case.

Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis has no cure.  Some patients may require [[dialysis]].  Eventually, a kidney transplant may be needed.
