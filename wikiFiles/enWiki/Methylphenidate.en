'''Methylphenidate''' (Ritalin) is a [[stimulant|psychostimulant]] [[drug]] approved for [[Therapy|treatment]] of ADHD or [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome]] and [[narcolepsy]]. The original patent was owned by [[Novartis#Ciba-Geigy|CIBA]], now [[Novartis|Novartis Corporation]]. It was first licensed by the [[FDA]] in 1955 for treating ADHD, prescribed from 1960, and became heavily prescribed in the 1990s, when the diagnosis of ADHD itself became more widely accepted.<ref>www.ehow.com/about_5374709_ritalin-invented.html When Was Ritalin Invented?, citing Lawrence Diller: "Running on Ritalin", 1999</ref> 

ADHD and some other conditions are believed to be linked to sub-performance of the [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[glutamate]] processes in the brain, primarily in the pre-frontal cortex and peripheral cortex, responsible for [[Self-control|self-regulation]] functions, leading to self-regulation disorders compromising the sufferer's attention, self-control, behaviour, motivation, and executive function; methylphenidate primarily works by [[Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|reducing the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine]] which improves the levels and utility of these [[neurotransmitter]]s in the brain. Methylphenidate possesses some structural and pharmacological similarities to [[cocaine]], though methylphenidate is less potent and longer in duration.<ref>[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/issues/ritalin.html "Ritalin & Cocaine: The Connection and the Controversy"].

== Production and brand-names ==
Methylphenidate is produced in the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]] and [[Pakistan]]. Ritalin is also sold in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and other European countries (although in much lower volumes than in the United States). Other brands include '''Concerta''', '''Methylin''', and '''Daytrana''', and generic forms, including '''Methylin''', '''Metadate''' and '''Attenta''' are produced by numerous pharmaceutical companies throughout the world.  In Belgium the product is sold under the name '''Rilatine''' and in Brazil, Portugal and Argentina as '''Ritalina'''. In Thailand, it is found under the name '''Hynidate'''.

The [[dextrorotary]] [[enantiomer]] of methylphenidate, known as [[dexmethylphenidate]], is sold as a generic and under the brand names '''Focalin''' and '''Attenade'''.

== History ==
Methylphenidate was first synthesized in 1944,<ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Panizzon| first1=Leandro| title=La preparazione di piridil- e piperidil-arilacetonitrili e di alcuni prodotti di trasformazione (Parte Ia)| journal=Helvetica Chimica Acta| volume=27| pages=1748–56| year=1944| doi=10.1002/hlca.194402701222}}</ref> and was identified as a stimulant in 1954.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=R|last2=Gross|first2=F|last3=Tripod|first3=J|title=Ritalin, a new synthetic compound with specific analeptic components |journal=Klinische Wochenschrift|volume=32|issue=19–20|pages=445–50|year=1954| pmid=13164273}}</ref>

Methylphenidate was synthesized by Ciba (now [[Novartis]]) chemist Leandro Panizzon. His wife, Marguerite, had low blood pressure and would take the drug as a stimulant before playing tennis. He named the substance Ritaline, after his wife's nickname, Rita.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=a4DuGVwyN6cC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=named+ritalin+after+his+wife#v=onepage&q=named%20ritalin%20after%20his%20wife&f=false

Originally it was marketed as a mixture of two racemates, 80% (±)-erythro and 20% (±)-threo. Subsequent studies of the racemates showed that the central stimulant activity is associated with the threo racemate and were focused on the separation and interconversion of the erythro isomer into the more active threo isomer.<ref>Leandro Panizzon et al ''Pyridine and piperdjine compounds'' {{US patent|2,507,631}} Issue date: May 16, 1950</ref><ref>Rudolf Rouietscji et al ''Process for the conversion of'' {{US patent|2838519}} Issue date: Jun 10, 1958</ref><ref>Rudolf Rouietscji et al ''Process for the conversion of'' {{US patent|2,957,880}} Issue date: Oct 25, 1960</ref>

Beginning in the 1960s, it was used to treat children with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] or [[Attention deficit disorder|ADD]], known at the time as hyperactivity or minimal brain dysfunction (MBD). Production and prescription of methylphenidate rose significantly in the 1990s, especially in the [[United States]], as the ADHD diagnosis came to be better understood and more generally accepted within the medical and mental health communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dea.gov/pubs/cngrtest/ct051600.htm|title=DEA Congressional Testimony|author = Terrance Woodworth|date = May 16, 2000 |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref>

In 2000 [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen]] received U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval to market "Concerta", an extended-release form of Ritalin.<ref>[http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approvals/drug-details.aspx?DrugID=637 Newly Approved Drug Therapies (637) Concerta, Alza].

[[File:Methylphenidate2.png|thumb|250px|[[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[space-filling model]] methylphenidate [[molecule]]]]

Methylphenidate is a [[2-Benzylpiperidine|benzylpiperidine]] [[derivative]]. It also shares part of its basic structure with [[catecholamine]]s and [[phenethylamine]]s.

Methylphenidate primarily acts as a [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]. Methylphenidate is most active at modulating levels of [[dopamine]] and to a lesser extent [[norepinephrine]].<ref name="Heal DJ, Pierce DM 2006 713–38">{{Cite journal|author=Heal DJ, Pierce DM |title=Methylphenidate and its isomers: their role in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder using a transdermal delivery system |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=713–38 |year=2006 |pmid=16953648 |doi= 10.2165/00023210-200620090-00002 }}</ref> Similar to [[cocaine]], methylphenidate binds to and blocks [[dopamine transporter]]s and [[norepinephrine transporter]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Iversen L |title=Neurotransmitter transporters and their impact on the development of psychopharmacology |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=147 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S82–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16402124 |pmc=1760736 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0706428}}</ref>

While both [[amphetamine]] and methylphenidate are [[dopaminergic]], it should be noted that their methods of action are distinct. Specifically, methylphenidate is a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] while amphetamine is a [[dopamine releasing agent]]. Each of these drugs has a corresponding effect on norepinephrine which is weaker than its effect on dopamine.  Methylphenidate's mechanism of action at dopamine-norepinephrine release is still debated, but is fundamentally different from [[phenethylamine]] derivatives, as methylphenidate is thought to increase general firing rate, whereas [[amphetamine]] reverses the flow of the monoamine transporters.<ref name="pmid15303308">{{Cite journal|author=Viggiano D, Vallone D, Sadile A |title=Dysfunctions in dopamine systems and ADHD: evidence from animals and modeling |journal=Neural Plasticity |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages=102, 106–107 |year=2004 |pmid=15303308 |pmc=2565441 |doi=10.1155/NP.2004.97}}Full-text [http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/np/2004/484192.pdf]</ref><ref>Novartis: [https://www.medportica.com/medporticaPortal/microsite.portal?microsite_product_name=FOCALIN Focalin XR Overview]</ref><ref>[http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/focalinXR.pdf Focalin XR – Full Prescribing Information].

Methylphenidate has both [[dopamine transporter]] and [[norepinephrine transporter]] binding affinity, with the [[dextromethylphenidate]] [[enantiomers]] displaying a prominent affinity for the norepinephrine transporter. Both the [[dextrorotary]] and [[levorotary]] enantiomers displayed receptor affinity for the [[serotonergic]] 5HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5HT<sub>2B</sub> subtypes, though direct binding to the [[serotonin transporter]] was not observed.<ref name="pmid17201613">{{Cite journal|author=Markowitz JS, DeVane CL, Pestreich LK, Patrick KS, Muniz R |title=A comprehensive in vitro screening of d-, l-, and dl-threo-methylphenidate: an exploratory study |journal=J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=687–98 |year=2006 |pmid=17201613 |doi=10.1089/cap.2006.16.687 }}</ref>

Methylphenidate may also exert a neuroprotective action against the neurotoxic effects of Parkinson's disease and methamphetamine abuse.<ref name="neuroprotection">{{Cite journal|author=T. J.

The dextrorotary enantiomers are significantly more potent than the levorotary enantiomers, and some medications therefore only contain [[dexmethylphenidate]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== ADHD and stimulant dynamics in general ===
{{Main|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology}}

Studies confirm that biological and genetic differences of the kinds predicted by [[low arousal theory]] are clearly visible in ADHD sufferers, and have been confirmed both genetically and by ''in vivo'' scans of ADHD sufferer brains. [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] scans have revealed that people with ADHD show differences from non-ADHD individuals in brain regions important for attention regulation and control of impulsive behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rosack Jim |title=Brain Scans Reveal Physiology of ADHD |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=39 |issue=1 |date=2 January 2004|url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/39/1/26 |page=26 }}</ref> Methylphenidate's cognitive enhancement effects have been investigated using [[fMRI]] scans even in non-ADHD brains, which revealed modulation of brain activity in ways that enhance mental focus. Methylphenidate increases activity in the [[prefrontal cortex]] and attention-related areas of the [[parietal cortex]] during challenging mental tasks; these are the same areas that the above study demonstrated to be shrunken in ADHD brains. Methylphenidate also increased deactivation of [[default network]] regions during the task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liddle|first=Elizabeth B.|coauthors=Chris Hollis, Martin J. Batty, Madeline J.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Methylphenidate taken orally has a [[bioavailability]] of 11-52% with a duration of action around 3–6 hours for instant release, 3–8 hours for sustained release, and 8–12 hours for extended release (Concerta). The half-life of methylphenidate is between 4–12 hours depending on the individual and the form of methylphenidate taken. The peak plasma time is achieved in 6–8 hours with peak plasma concentration averaging 3.7 [[nanograms|ng]]/[[millilitres|mL]].<ref>Methylphenidate - Pharmacology - MedScape</ref>

=== Detection in biological fluids ===
The concentration of methylphenidate or ritalinic acid, its major metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum or whole blood in order to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage.<ref>R.

==== Mechanisms of ADHD ====
The means by which methylphenidate affects people diagnosed with ADHD are not well understood. Some researchers have theorized that ADHD is caused by a [[dopamine]] imbalance in the [[brain]]s of those affected. Methylphenidate is a norepinephrine and [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]], which means that it increases the level of the dopamine [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain by partially blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) that removes dopamine from the [[synapse]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Volkow ND, Wang GJ, Fowler JS, ''et al.'' |title=Dopamine transporter occupancies in the human brain induced by therapeutic doses of oral methylphenidate |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=10 |pages=1325–31 |year=1998 |pmid=9766762}}</ref> This inhibition of DAT blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into the presynaptic neuron, increasing the amount of dopamine in the synapse. It also stimulates the release of dopamine and norepinephrine into the synapse. Finally, it increases the magnitude of dopamine release after a stimulus, increasing the salience of stimulus. An alternate explanation that has been explored is that the methylphenidate affects the action of [[serotonin]] in the brain.<ref name="pmid15303308"/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gainetdinov RR, Caron MG |title=Genetics of childhood disorders: XXIV.

=== Narcolepsy ===
[[Narcolepsy]], a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden need for sleep, is treated primarily with stimulants. Methylphenidate is considered effective in increasing wakefulness, vigilance, and performance.<ref name="pmid9484423">{{Cite journal|author=Fry JM |title=Treatment modalities for narcolepsy |journal=Neurology |volume=50 |issue=2 Suppl 1 |pages=S43–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9484423 }}</ref> Methylphenidate improves measures of [[somnolence]] on standardized tests, such as the [[Multiple Sleep Latency Test]], but performance does not improve to levels comparable to healthy controls.<ref name="pmid7701190">{{Cite journal|author=Mitler MM |title=Evaluation of treatment with stimulants in narcolepsy |journal=Sleep |volume=17 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=S103–6 |year=1994|pmid=7701190 }}</ref>

=== Aggression and criminality in Adult ADHD===
While side-effects and misuse of methylphenidate have been associated with an increased risk of aggression and psychosis, newer studies indicate that it could be useful in the treatment of ADHD in adults with a history of aggressive and [[crime|criminal behavior]]. A large clinical study conducted in Sweden found a significant reduction of the criminality rate in males (32%) and females (42%) as compared with the rate for the same patients while not receiving medication.<ref>P.

=== Investigational ===
Animal studies using rats with ADHD-like behaviours were used to assess the safety of methylphenidate on the developing brain and found that psychomotor impairments, structural and functional parameters of the dopaminergic system were improved with treatment. This animal data suggests that methylphenidate supports brain development and hyperactivity in children diagnosed with ADHD. However, in normal control animals methylphenidate caused long lasting changes to the dopaminergic system suggesting that if a child is misdiagnosed with ADHD they may be at risk of long lasting adverse effects to brain development. Animal tests found that rats given methylphenidate grew up to be more stressed and emotional. It is unclear due to lack of follow-up study whether this occurs in ADHD like animals and whether it occurs in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Grund T, Lehmann K, Bock N, Rothenberger A, Teuchert-Noodt G |title=Influence of methylphenidate on brain development—an update of recent animal experiments |journal=Behav Brain Funct |volume=2 |page=2 |year=2006 |pmid=16403217 |pmc=1363724 |doi=10.1186/1744-9081-2-2 }}</ref> However, long lasting benefits of stimulant drugs have not been found in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sagvolden T, Sergeant JA |title=Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder—from brain dysfunctions to behaviour |journal=Behav.

On March 22, 2006, the FDA Pediatric Advisory Committee decided that medications using methylphenidate ingredients do not need [[black box warning]]s about their risks, noting that "for normal children, these drugs do not appear to pose an obvious cardiovascular risk."<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/minutes/2006-4210m_Minutes%20PAC%20March%2022%202006.pdf Minutes of the FDA Pediatric Advisory Committee].

=== Contraindications ===
Methylphenidate should not be prescribed concomitantly with [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, such as [[desipramine]], or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s, such as [[phenelzine]] or [[tranylcypromine]], as methylphenidate may dangerously increase plasma concentrations, leading to potential toxic reactions (mainly, [[cardiovascular]] effects).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}{{vague|date=January 2013}} Methylphenidate should not be prescribed to patients who suffer from severe [[arrhythmia]], [[arterial hypertension|hypertension]] or [[liver|liver damage]]. It should not be prescribed to patients who demonstrate [[Drug addiction#Behavior|drug-seeking behaviour]], pronounced agitation or nervousness.<ref name="pmid11056411" /> Care should be taken while prescribing methylphenidate to children with a family history of [[Supraventricular tachycardia|Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT)]].

=== Special precautions ===
Special precaution is recommended in individuals with epilepsy with additional caution in individuals with uncontrolled epilepsy due to the potential for methylphenidate to lower the seizure threshold.<ref name="Tan M, Appleton R 2005 57–9">{{Cite journal|author=Tan M, Appleton R |title=Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, methylphenidate, and epilepsy |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=57–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15613514 |pmc=1720074 |doi=10.1136/adc.2003.048504}}</ref> There is no published evidence to suggest that either the
short or long term treatment with methylphenidate increases the risk of developing seizures in children with ADHD.<ref name="Tan M, Appleton R 2005 57–9"/> A number of small trials suggest that it is safe for use in children with epilepsy. Further randomised control trials are needed.

=== Pregnancy ===
The U.S. FDA gives methylphenidate a [[pregnancy category]] of C, and women are advised to only use the drug if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/methylphenidate.html Methylphenidate Use During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding]. Drugs.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-30.</ref> Not enough animal and human studies have been conducted to conclusively demonstrate an effect of methylphenidate on fetal development.

Intravenous methylphenidate abuse was confounded with the concurrent use of other substances (e.g., [[cigarettes]], [[alcohol]]) during pregnancy.

== Overdose and toxicology ==
In the majority of unremarkable isolated cases MPH overdose is asymptomatic (symptomless) or only incurs minor symptoms even in children under age 6.<ref name="Michigan 2000" /><ref name="poison 2010" /><ref name="pmid18058301" /> In cases that manifest symptoms, these can typically include agitation, hallucinations, psychosis, lethargy, seizures, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, hypertension, and hyperthermia.<ref name="pmid11981294">{{Cite journal|author=Klein-Schwartz W |title=Abuse and toxicity of methylphenidate |journal=Current Opinion in Pediatrics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=219–23 |year=2002 |pmid=11981294 |doi=10.1097/00008480-200204000-00013}}</ref> LD50 in mice is 190&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref>https://www.erowid.org/pharms/methylphenidate/methylphenidate_info1.shtml</ref> 

Studies of reported incidents tend to show that most overdoses are unintentional and generally conclude that severe or major  toxicity are comparatively rare events (none in the Michigan study of 289 incidents,<ref name="Michigan 2000" /> 0.9% in the 2004 US national analysis with n=8336,<ref name="poison 2004">[http://www.poison.org/prevent/documents/TESS%20Annual%20Report%202004.pdf 2004 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System] - Table 22B p.652</ref> and 0.2% in the same analysis for 2010 with n=6503<ref name="poison 2010" />). 

Death rates are also comparatively low (none in the Michigan study, 0.36 per 1000 with n=3 for the 2004 US national analysis, 0.15 per 1000 with n=1 for the 2010 analysis; the US national guideline approved 2007 also notes only 2 deaths reported as primarily to MPH overdose from 2000-05<ref name="pmid18058301" />). 

A 2008 review generally agreed these findings but noted recreation or study use was "fairly common" in US university studies and that the risk could only be said to be low "in the short term" since there was little certainty about long term effects of overdose and abuse.<ref>[http://jop.sagepub.com/content/23/2/194.short Safety of therapeutic methylphenidate in adults: a systematic review of the evidence] - 2008, Godfrey</ref> A 2011 Swiss study also agreed the general findings, adding a cautionary note that serious or severe outcomes such as [[necrosis]], [[abscess]] and [[amputation]] had occurred as a result of severe toxicity at the injection site in 3 cases of abuse via injection, especially when arterial.<ref name="Swiss" />

=== Medical and emergency handling ===
Key recommendations in US guidelines for overdose handling include:<ref name="pmid18058301" />

*''Well evidenced findings (evidence standard "A"):'' 0–6 years: <2&nbsp;mg/kg rarely causes serious toxicity, 0–5 years: up to 40&nbsp;mg well tolerated, 6–12 years: up to 80&nbsp;mg well tolerated;
*''Evidence grade "B" and "C":'' If <6 years and >2&nbsp;mg/kg, or <60&nbsp;kg and >1&nbsp;mg/kg, or ≥60&nbsp;kg and >60&nbsp;mg: refer to emergency help;
*''Tentative only (D):'' 4&nbsp;mg/kg or 120&nbsp;mg of intact modified (slow) release version:  refer to emergency help.
*''Symptoms (D):'' "Patients experiencing any changes in behavior other than mild stimulation or agitation should be referred to an emergency department. Examples of moderate to severe symptoms that warrant referral include moderate-to-severe agitation, hallucinations, abnormal muscle movements, headache, chest pain, loss of consciousness, or convulsions".
*''Other factors:'' Cases of intent, malicious administration (by another), as well as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) users should always be referred to emergency help;
*''Passage of time/delay:'' Patients where more than 3 hours have passed without symptoms do not usually need referral to emergency help.
* [[Benzodiazepines]] may be used as treatment if agitation, dystonia, or convulsions are present.

=== Poison control centre analyses and study findings ===
A study in 2000 looked in detail at all 289 overdoses of MPH reported to the [[Children's Hospital of Michigan]] regional [[poison control center]] during 1993 and 1994 (excluded: 105 extended-release formulations or co-ingestants, to ensure MPH overdose effects were not confounded by other effects).<ref name="Michigan 2000" /> The case histories were:  ''Age:'' 251 aged under 18, 38 adult; ''Reason:'' 68 (23%) intentional/unknown/error. In 163 cases (56%) the dose was known and in 41% the patient's own MPH was involved. Variation in overdose ranged from <1&nbsp;mg/kg (30%) to >3&nbsp;mg/kg (7.5%) mean 1.7&nbsp;mg/kg. Findings:

*Although no patient developed "severe" symptoms, but "less favourable" symptoms were seen with intentional overdoses. In overdoses below 2&nbsp;mg/kg the majority (63-75%) suffered no effect and a minority (9-16%) suffered a moderate effect. Above 3&nbsp;mg/kg around 27% suffered a moderate effect. Overall symptoms occurred in 31% of all overdoses. In paediatric exposures 29% developed symptoms but 66% suffered no clinical effects (mild/moderate effects: 34%). Symptomatic findings were:<ref name="Michigan 2000" />

*"Intentional ingestion of MPH was most commonly associated with isolated symptoms of tachycardia, agitation, lethargy, vomiting, dizziness, mydriasis, and tremor. Of the 8 patients in this group who manifested multiple symptoms, erythema, diaphoresis, hypertension, emesis, chest pain, tremor, fever, and insomnia"

*Symptoms were common (33%) in the 0-5 age group: "Isolated lethargy, agitation, headache, and vomiting were most commonly seen. One patient in this group developed dystonia, and two developed agitation in combination with hypertension or tachycardia."

In 2004, the [[American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System]] annual report showed about 8300 methylphenidate ingestions reported in US poison center data,<ref name="pmid18058301"/><ref name="poison 2004" /> of which 72% were accidental or unintended, and 19% involved children age 0-6. The most common reasons for intentional exposure were drug abuse and suicide attempts.<ref name="pmid8109495"/> The 2010 report<ref name="poison 2010" /> showed 6500 single reported exposures in the US for the year. 2010 incidents:
*''By age:'' 0-5: 24%, 6-12: 38%, 13-19:21%, 20+: 16%, other adult: 1%.
*''By cause:'' accident/error: 79%, intended: 18%, other: 3%.
*''By outcome:'' moderate: 624, major:13, death:1, others were no outcome, minor, or unknown. (2004 outcomes: moderate: 940, major: 73, death: 3)<ref name="poison 2004" />

A [[Switzerland|Swiss]] study in 2011 also concurred, noting similar findings in several studies and national analyses in that country, but noted that these findings were potentially inapplicable to the few cases of abuse via crushed MPH injection, which was the sole situation where "serious" or "severe" local toxicity was observed, leading in their study to [[pain]], [[necrosis]] and partial limb or digit [[amputation]] in two of 14 adult cases over 8 years (14%) who mistakenly injected [[artery|arterially]], and [[Groin|inguinal]] [[abscess]] and [[fever]] in one who injected [[intravenous]]ly.<ref name="Swiss" />

== Tolerance ==

However, there have also been studies that show that chronic administration of methylphenidate ''increases'' sensitivity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yang|title=Chronic administration of methylphenidate produces neurophysiological and behavioral sensitization|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17335781|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref> This phenomenon, known as [[sensitization]], is known to occur with chronic administration of [[amphetamine]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.08.025}}</ref>

== Abuse potential ==
[[File:Ritalin.jpg|thumb|250px|Legal warning printed on Ritalin packaging]]

Methylphenidate has some potential for [[substance abuse|abuse]] due to its action on dopamine transporters, which is the same as that of [[cocaine]].<ref name="pmid11056411" /><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zhu J, Reith ME |title=Role of the dopamine transporter in the action of psychostimulants, nicotine, and other drugs of abuse |journal=CNS & Neurological Disorders Drug Targets |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=393–409 |year=2008 |pmid=19128199 |doi=10.2174/187152708786927877|pmc=3133725}}</ref> Methylphenidate, like other [[stimulants]], increases [[dopamine]] levels in the brain, but at therapeutic doses this increase is slow, and thus [[euphoria]] only rarely occurs even when it is administered [[intravenously]].<ref name="pmid9862747">{{Cite pmid|9862747}}</ref>  The abuse and addiction potential of methylphenidate is therefore significantly lower than that of cocaine.<ref name="pmid9862747"/> The abuse potential is increased when methylphenidate is crushed and insufflated (snorted), or when it is injected, producing effects somewhat similar to cocaine.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Cocaine-like effects can also occur with very large doses taken orally.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} However, the dose that produces euphoric effects varies among individuals. Methylphenidate has less abuse potential than cocaine and amphetamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Volkow ND, Swanson JM |title=Variables that affect the clinical use and abuse of methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=11 |pages=1909–18 |year=2003 |pmid=14594733 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.1909}}</ref>

The primary source of methylphenidate for abuse is diversion from legitimate prescriptions, rather than illicit synthesis. Those who use methylphenidate medicinally generally take it orally, while intranasal and intravenous are the preferred means for recreational use.<ref name="pmid11981294" /> IV users tend to be adults whose use may cause panlobular [[pulmonary emphysema]].<ref name="pmid8109495">{{Cite journal|author=Stern EJ, Frank MS, Schmutz JF, Glenny RW, Schmidt RA, Godwin JD |title=Panlobular pulmonary emphysema caused by i.v. injection of methylphenidate (Ritalin): findings on chest radiographs and CT scans |journal=American Journal of Roentgenology |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=555–60 |year=1994 |pmid=8109495}}</ref>

Abuse of prescription stimulants is higher amongst college students than non-college attending young adults. College students use methylphenidate either as a study aid or to stay awake longer. Increased alcohol consumption due to stimulant misuse has additional negative effects on health.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Arria AM, Wish ED |title=Nonmedical use of prescription stimulants among students |journal=Pediatric Annals |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=565–71 |year=2006 |pmid=16986451|pmc=3168781}}</ref>

Patients who have been prescribed Ritalin have been known to sell their tablets to others who wish to take the drug recreationally. In the USA it is one of the top ten stolen prescription drugs.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Recreational users may crush the tablets and either snort the powder, or dissolve the powder in water, filter it through cotton wool into a syringe to remove the inactive ingredients and other particles and inject the drug intravenously. Both of these methods increase [[bioavailability]] and produce a much more rapid onset of effects than when taken orally (within c. 5–10 minutes through insufflation and within just 10–15 seconds through intravenous injection); however the overall duration of action tends to be decreased by any non-oral use of drug preparations made for oral use.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article1728430.ece|title=Kiddie coke: A new peril in the playground|last=Midgely|first=Carol|date=February 21, 2003 |work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=21 February 2010|location=London}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Methylphenidate is sometimes used by students to enhance their mental abilities, improving their concentration and helping them to study. Professor [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]], an expert in bioethics, has said that it would be unethical to stop healthy people taking the drug.

*In the [[United States]], methylphenidate is classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule II]] [[controlled substance]], the designation used for substances that have a recognized medical value but present a high potential for abuse.
*In the [[United Kingdom]], methylphenidate is a controlled 'Class B' substance. Possession without prescription carries with a sentence up to 5 years and/or an unlimited fine, and supplying it is 14 years and/or an unlimited fine.<ref>http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/drugs-law/Class-a-b-c/</ref>
*In [[Canada]], methylphenidate is listed in Schedule III of the ''Controlled Drugs and Substances Act'' (along with LSD, psychedelic mushrooms, and mescaline, among others), and is illegal to possess without a prescription, pursuant to Part G (section G.01.002) of the Food and Drug Regulations under the ''Food and Drugs Act''.
*In [[New Zealand]], methylphenidate is a 'class B2 controlled substance'. Unlawful possession is punishable by six-month prison sentence and distribution of it is punishable by a 14-year sentence.
* In [[Australia]], methylphenidate is a 'Schedule 8' controlled substance. Such drugs must be kept in a lockable safe before being handed out and possession without prescription carries hefty fines and even imprisonment.

A newer way of taking methylphenidate is by using a [[transdermal patch]] (under the brand name [[Daytrana]]), similar to those used for [[nicotine replacement therapy]].

Concerta tablets are marked with the letters "ALZA" and followed by: "18", "27", "36", or "54", relating to the mg dosage strength.

In total, each capsule is effective for about eight hours.

Metadate&nbsp;CD capsules contain two types of beads; 30% of the beads are immediate release, and the other 70% of the beads are evenly sustained release.<ref>[http://adhd.emedtv.com/metadate-cd/metadate-cd.html Metadate&nbsp;CD]. Adhd.emedtv.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-30.</ref>

==Controversy==
{{Main|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies}}
Methylphenidate has been the subject of controversy in relation to its use in the treatment of ADHD. One such criticism is prescribing [[psychostimulants]] medication to children to reduce ADHD symptoms.<ref name="pmid17949504"/> The pharmacological effects of methylphenidate resemble closely those of [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamine]],<ref name=DEA_Petition_Response/> which is the desired effect in the treatment of ADHD,<ref name="adhd.org.nz"/> and how methylphenidate works.<ref name="jneurosci.org"/>

Shortages of Ritalin in 2011<ref name=NYTShortage/> have been blamed on overmedication, itself ironically due to inattention to alternative therapies or measurement of long-term efficacy.<ref name=NYTGoneWrong/> Attempts have been made to rebut these charges, primarily by questioning the assumptions of studies conducted long after the treatment period has ended.<ref name="JoanHamburg ChildMind.org"/>

A 2002 study showed that rats treated with methylphenidate are more receptive to the reinforcing effects of cocaine.<ref name="cocaine">http://www.udel.edu/chemo/teaching/CHEM465/SitesF02/Prop26b/Rit%20Page4.html Pretreatment with methylphenidate sensitizes rats to the reinforcing effects of cocaine</ref> The contention that methylphenidate acts as a [[gateway drug]] has been discredited by multiple sources,<ref name=nih.gov-nida-29.htm/><ref name="Wilens"/><ref name="Barkley"/> according to which abuse is statistically very low and "stimulant therapy in childhood does not increase the risk for subsequent drug and alcohol abuse disorders later in life".<ref name=drugabuse.gov-ADHDFacts/>

Another controversial idea surrounding ADHD is whether to call it a disorder when patients, in general, have healthy appearing brains with no gross [[neurological]] deficits.<ref name=WeinbergBrumback/>  However, this is generally accepted as fallacious reasoning because many individuals with mental retardation, schizophrenia, migraine headaches or epilepsy will have a normal brain MRI and neurologic exam.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  

Treatment of ADHD by way of Methylphenidate has led to legal actions including [[malpractice]] suits regarding [[informed consent]], inadequate information on [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[misdiagnosis]], and coercive use of medications by [[school systems]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ouellette EM |title=Legal issues in the treatment of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=Journal of Child Neurology |volume=6 Suppl |pages=S68–75 |year=1991 |pmid=2002217 }}</ref> In the U.S. and the United Kingdom, it is approved for use in children and adolescents.

[[Neil Bush]], in an interview with [[Connie Chung]], has spoken of his opposition to the use of Ritalin as well as labeling children with ADHD.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0209/26/cct.00.html Interview With Neil Bush; Interview With Magic Johnson].

== Chemistry ==
Four isomers of methylphenidate are known to exist. One pair of [[threo]] isomers and one pair of erythro are distinguished, from which only [[d-threo-methylphenidate]] exhibits the pharmacologically usually desired effects.<ref name="Heal DJ, Pierce DM 2006 713–38"/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Froimowitz M, Patrick KS, Cody V |title=Conformational analysis of methylphenidate and its structural relationship to other dopamine reuptake blockers such as CFT |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=1430–4 |year=1995 |pmid=8584475 |doi=10.1023/A:1016262815984}}</ref> When the drug was first introduced it was sold as a 3:1 mixture of erythro:threo [[diastereomer]]s. The erythro diastereomers are also ''[[pressor]]'' amines. "TMP" is referring only to the threo product that does not contain any erythro diastereomers. Since the threo isomers are energetically favored, it is easy to [[epimerize]] out any of the undesired erythro isomers. The drug that contains only [[dextrorotary]] methylphenidate is called d-TMP. A review on the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (2''R'',2'''R'')-(+)-''threo''-methylphenidate hydrochloride has been published.<ref name=Prashad>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/1615-4169(200107)343:5<379::AID-ADSC379>3.0.CO;2-4|last1 = Prashad|first1 = M|year = 2001|title = Approaches to the Preparation of Enantiomerically Pure (2R,2′R)-(+)-threo-Methylphenidate Hydrochloride|journal = Adv.
