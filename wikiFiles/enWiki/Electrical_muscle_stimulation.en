'''Electrical muscle stimulation''' (EMS), also known as '''neuromuscular electrical stimulation''' (NMES) or '''electromyostimulation''', is the elicitation of [[muscle contraction]] using electric impulses. EMS has received increasing attention in the last few years, because it has the potential to serve as: a strength training tool for healthy subjects and athletes; a rehabilitation and preventive tool for partially or totally immobilized patients; a testing tool for evaluating the neural and/or muscular function in vivo; a post-exercise recovery tool for athletes.<ref name="ISEK2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00421-011-2133-7 |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-011-2133-7 |title=Electrical stimulation for neuromuscular testing and training: State-of-the art and unresolved issues |year=2011 |last1=Maffiuletti |first1=Nicola A. |last2=Minetto |first2=Marco A. |last3=Farina |first3=Dario |last4=Bottinelli |first4=Roberto |journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=111 |issue=10 |pages=2391}}</ref> The impulses are generated by a device and delivered through electrodes on the skin in direct proximity to the muscles to be stimulated. <ref>http://www.spinehappy.com/electric-muscle-stimulation.html</ref> The impulses mimic the [[action potential]] coming from the [[central nervous system]], causing the muscles to contract.

In EMS training few muscular groups are targeted at the same time, for specific training goals.<ref name="Vrbova2008"/> The effectiveness of the devices for sport training has been debated. A niche of coaches regularly use professional EMS devices as integral part of the training of their athletes; some of these are high profile coaches, such as track coach [[Charlie Francis]], who used the technique to supplement the training of Olympic-level athletes.<ref>Charlie Francis, The Truth About EMS -Electronic Muscle Stimulation: Facts and Fallacies [http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_truth_about_ems&cr= T-Nation]</ref> Non-professional devices target home-market consumers<ref name="slendertone">{{cite journal |first1=John P. |last1=Porcari |first2=Jennifer |last2=Miller |first3=Kelly |last3=Cornwell |first4=Carl |last4=Foster |first5=Mark |last5=Gibson |first6=Karen |last6=McLean |first7=Tom |last7=Kernozek |year=2005 |title=Effects of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Training on Abdominal Strength, Endurance, and Selected Anthropometric Measures |journal=Journal of Sports Science and Medicine |volume=4 |pages=66–75}}</ref> with wearable units in which EMS circuitry is contained in belt-like garments (ab toning belts) or other clothing items.

== FDA certification in USA ==
The  [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) certifies and releases EMS devices into two broad categories: over-the counter devices (OTC), and prescription devices. OTC devices are marketable only for muscle toning; prescription devices can only be purchased with a medical prescription for therapy and should be used under supervision of an authorized practitioner, for the following uses:
* Relaxation of muscle spasms;
* Prevention or retardation of disuse atrophy;
* Increasing local blood circulation;
* Muscle re-education;
* Immediate post-surgical stimulation of calf muscles to prevent [[venous thrombosis]];
* Maintaining or increasing range of motion.
The FDA mandates that manuals prominently display contraindication, warnings, precautions and adverse reactions, including: no use for wearer of pacemaker; no use on vital parts, such as carotid sinus nerves, across the chest, or across the brain; caution in the use during pregnancy, menstruation, and other particular conditions that may be affected by muscle contractions; potential adverse effects include skin irritations and burns

Only FDA-certified devices can be lawfully sold in the US without medical prescription. These can be found at the corresponding FDA webpage for certified devices.<ref name="FDA-Certified Devices">[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?start_search=1&ProductCode=ngx&KNumber=K&ThirdPartyReviewed=off&IVDProducts=off FDA-Certified Devices]</ref> The FTC has cracked down on consumer EMS devices that made unsubstantiated claims;<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/05/projectabsurd.htm FTC Charges Three Top-selling Electronic Abdominal Exercise Belts with Making False Claims]</ref> many have been removed from the market, some have obtained FDA certification.

== Use in Europe ==

Electrical muscle stimulation use in Europe is not as strictly regulated as in the USA. While the devices produced by manufacturers are still certified under EC directives, medical device authorities are more permissive in their adoption and use. Many European countries do not mandate medical prescriptions for use, and EMS devices are regarded as a common over-the-counter remedy.

==Popular culture ==
* The [[Star Wars]] novel [[Shadows of the Empire]] describes a 'myostim' chair that artificially stimulates muscles to build muscle mass and strength.
* The science fiction movie [[The Matrix]] contains a scene in which Neo's muscles are activated aboard a levitating ship, the [[Nebuchadnezzar (ship)|Nebuchadnezzar]], by means of [[acupuncture]] needles and EMS after a lifetime of being 'cocooned'.
