'''Cinoxacin''' has been discontinued in the U.K.<ref>http://health.cd-writer.com/c3/p1561/treatment_for/cinobac_discontinued_in_the_uk.html</ref> as well the United States, both as a branded drug or a generic.

Cinoxacin was an older synthetic antimicrobial related to the quinolone class of antibiotics with activity similar to Oxolinic Acid and Nalidixic Acid.  It was commonly used thirty years ago to treat urinary tract infections in adults.  There are reports that cinoxacin had also been used to treat initial and recurrent urinary tract infections and bacterial prostatitis in dogs<ref>Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary 3rd Edition, by D.C. Blood, V.P. Studdert and C.C. Gay, Elsevier</ref> however this veterinary use was never approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  In complicated UTI, the older gyrase-inhibitors such as cinoxacin are no longer indicated.<ref>Z Arztl Fortbild (Jena). 1995 Jun;89(3):279-86
[Antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections][Article in German] Peters HJ. Urologische Abteilung, St. Elisabeth-Krankenhaus Köln-Hohenlind.</ref>

==History==
Cinoxacin is one of the original quinolone drugs, which were introduced in the 1970s. Commonly referred to as the first generation quinolones. This first generation also included other quinolone drugs such as pipemidic acid, and oxolinic acid, but this first generation proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid.  Cinoxacin is similar chemically (and in antimicrobial activity) to oxolonic acid and nalidixic acid. Relative to nalidixic acid, cinoxacin was found to have a slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity.  Cinoxacin was patented in 1972 and assigned to Eli Lilly.<ref>Pharmaceutical manufacturing encyclopedia, Volume 2 By Marshall Sittig see page 346</ref>  Eli Lilly obtained approval from the FDA to market cinoxacin in the United States as Cinobac on June 13, 1980.  Prior to this cinobac was marketed in the U.K. and Switzerland in 1979.

Oclassen Pharmaceuticals (Oclassen Dermatologics) commenced sales of Cinobac in the United States and Canada back in September 1992, under an agreement with Eli Lilly which granted Oclassen exclusive United States and Canadian distribution rights.<ref>http://www.123jump.com/10K_Reports/WPI/1997/1997.htm</ref>  Oclassen promoted Cinobac primarily to urologists for the outpatient treatment of initial and recurrent urinary tract infections and prophylaxis.  Oclassen Pharmaceuticals was a privately held pharmaceutical company founded in 1985 until acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in 1997.  Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (also incorporated in 1985), having acquired Oclassen Pharmaceuticals (Oclassen Dermatologics) also acquired the marketing rights contained within the agreement with Eli Lilly to market cinobac.<ref>http://www.getfilings.com/o0001016843-98-000129.html</ref> 

Oddly enough Watson Pharma stated in 1999 that they were marketing cinobac for the treatment of skin diseases<ref>http://sec.edgar-online.com/watson-pharmaceuticals-inc/10-k405-annual-report-regulation-s-k-item-405/2000/03/30/section3.aspx</ref> (an unapproved use) and in 2001 that they were marketing cinobac as a general pain management product (yet another unapproved use).<ref>http://markets.financialcontent.com/edgar?accesscode=101706202000601</ref> 
It appears that this branded version was withdrawn sometime after 2003.

==Licensed uses==
Urinary tract infections only

===Pediatric restrictions===
Cinobac is not approved to treat pediatric patients.  Prescribing Cinobac to treat an unapproved use (other than Urinary tract infections) within the pediatric, as well as the adult population, does take place rather frequently.  The fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the FDA for use in children (other than the exception inhalational anthrax, which is restricted to levaquin and ciprofloxacin) due to the risk of fatalities<ref>http://download.veritasmedicine.com/PDF/CR002392_CSR.pdf</ref><ref>Adverse drug reaction monitoring of ciprofloxacin in pediatric practice. sudden death after intravenous ciprofloxacin Indian Pediatr. 1992 Feb;29(2):181-8.

==Availability==

==Mode of action==
Cinoxacin mode of action involves the inhibiting of [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase iv,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 |date= September 1, 1997 }}</ref> which is an enzyme necessary to separate replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

Evidence exists that cinoxacin binds strongly to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis.<ref>http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00827 see mechanism of action heading</ref>  The fluoroquinolones interfere with DNA replication by inhibiting an enzyme complex called DNA gyrase. This can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family display high activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases, and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and ''in vivo'' tumor models. Although the quinolone is highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of cytotoxic action is not known. Quinolone-induced DNA damage was first reported in 1986 (Hussy et al.).<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/29/6/1073.pdf | pmid = 3015015 | volume=29 | issue=6 | title=Effect of 4-quinolones and novobiocin on calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha primase complex, topoisomerases I and II, and growth of mammalian lymphoblasts | pmc=180502 | year=1986 | month=June | author=Hussy P, Maass G, T&uuml;mmler B, Grosse F, Schomburg U | pages=1073–8 | journal = Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy | doi=10.1128/AAC.29.6.1073}}</ref>

Partly as a result of the efforts of The State of Illinois and Public Citizen the FDA ordered a black box warnings on all fluoroquinolones advising consumers of the possible toxic effects of fluoroquinolones on tendons.<ref>^ "FDA orders 'black box' label on some antibiotics". http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/07/08/antibiotics.risk/index.html.

However, unlike the other drugs found within this class, the safety profile of cinoxacin appears to be rather unremarkable.

==Overdose==
Symptoms following an overdose of cinoxacin may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and diarrhea. The severity of the epigastric distress and the diarrhea are dose related.<ref name="drugbank.ca">http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00827</ref> Patients who have ingested an overdose of cinoxacin should be kept well hydrated to prevent crystalluria. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for an overdose of cinoxacin.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2002/18067s29lbl.pdf</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Biotransformation is mainly hepatic, with approximately 30-40% metabolized to inactive metabolites.  Protein Binding ranges from 60 to 80%.  Cinoxacin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The presence of food delays absorption but does not affect total absorption.  The mean serum half-life is 1.5 hours. Half-life in patients with impaired renal function may exceed 10 hours.<ref name="drugbank.ca"/><ref>Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1979 Feb;15(2):165-70.
Pharmacology of cinoxacin in humans.Black HR, Israel KS, Wolen RL, Brier GL, Obermeyer BD, Ziege EA, Wolny JD.</ref>

==Dosing==
The usual adult dosage for the treatment of urinary tract infections is 1 g daily, administered orally in 2 or 4 divided doses (500&nbsp;mg b.i.d. or 250&nbsp;mg q.i.d. respectively) for 7 to 14 days.

===Impaired Renal Function===
When renal function is impaired, a reduced dosage must be employed.

==Susceptible bacteria==
Gram-negative aerobes:

*Enterobacter species
*Escherichia coli
*Klebsiella species
*Proteus mirabilis
*Proteus vulgaris

Note: Enterococcus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus species are resistant.

==Regulatory history==
The regulatory history in the United States regarding cinoxacin has been deleted from the FDA site.  Though approved in 1980, there is only one document (circa 2002) available for reference.  Twenty two years worth or regulatory history concerning cinoxacin is unavailable.

===History of the black box warnings===
Musculoskeletal disorders attributed to use of quinolone antibiotics were first reported in the medical literature in 1972, as an adverse reaction to [[nalidixic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bailey RR, Natale R, Linton AL |title=Nalidixic acid arthralgia |journal=Can Med Assoc J |volume=107 |issue=7 |pages=604 passim |year=1972 |month=October |pmid=4541768 |pmc=1940945}}</ref> Rheumatic disease after use of a fluoroquinolone ([[norfloxacin]]) was first reported eleven years later.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bailey RR, Kirk JA, Peddie BA |title=Norfloxacin-induced rheumatic disease |journal=N Z Med J |volume=96 |issue=736 |pages=590 |year=1983 |month=July |pmid=6223241}}</ref> In a 1995 letter published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', representatives of the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) stated that the agency would "update the labeling [package insert] for all marketed fluoroquinolones to include a warning about the possibility of tendon rupture."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Szarfman A, Chen M, Blum MD |title=More on fluoroquinolone antibiotics and tendon rupture |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=332 |issue=3 |pages=193 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=7800023 |format=letter |doi=10.1056/NEJM199501193320319}}</ref>

By August 1996, the FDA had not taken action, and the consumer advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] filed a petition with the FDA prompting the agency to act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Petition to Require a Warning on All Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics (HRG Publication #1399) |date=August 1, 1996 |publisher=[[Public Citizen]] |url=http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=6595}} Retrieved on December 27, 2008.</ref> Two months later, the FDA published an alert in the ''FDA Medical Bulletin'' and requested that fluoroquinolone package inserts be amended to include information on this risk.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reports of adverse events with fluoroquinolones |journal=FDA Medical Bulletin |month=October | year=1996 |volume=26 |issue=3 |url=http://www.fda.gov/medbull/oct96/adverse.html }} {{Dead link|date=June 2009}} Retrieved on December 27, 2008. alternate link: http://www.fqresearch.org/text_documents/FDA_Medical_Bulletin_1996.doc</ref>

Review of the FDA website indicates that the majority of the generic versions of the fluoroquinolones have ''not'' been updated to include this Black Box Warning as of July 2009. And there are numerous reports that this information has not been dessiminated to the pharmacist, the products continue to contain the previous labels that are absent of this warning, and the Medication Guide has not been made available to the pharmicist or physician for distribution.

==Social and economic impact==
Spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions associated with cinoxacin, as well as other drugs found within the fluoroquinolone class, are repeatedly made on many Internet forums and medication feedback sites related to prescription drugs worldwide.<ref>http://www.rxlist.com</ref><ref>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fqtoxicity</ref>
<ref>http://www.favc.info</ref><ref>www.medicationsense.com</ref><ref>http://www.citizen.org</ref><ref>www.FluoroquinoloneAntibiotic.com</ref><ref>http://www.askapatient.com/</ref><ref>http://www.aaavam.com/ see also http://www.aaavam.com/index_01.html</ref> These adverse drug reactions are easily and likely often misdiagnosed as seizure disorder or regular CNS or psychiatric symptoms and the diagnosis of quinolone toxicity or adverse reaction missed. Research conducted in Italy has shown that quinolones such as cinoxacin are one of the top causes of CNS disturbances in general practice.<ref>http://www.em-news.com/pt/re/emmednews/pdfhandler.00132981-200810000-00023.pdf;jsessionid=JNJGnJrSnxkP9r3mcySnGQJGZ5qDNRJv18N8bJvkhJ41877mWQM2!1321082991!181195629!8091!-1</ref>   Another Italian study done in 2008 showed a far greater risk of an adverse reaction occurring with cinoxacin (cinoxacin was related to the highest ROR value) as compared to the other quinolone drugs.<ref>Pharmacol Res. 2008 Sep-Oct;58(3-4):202-7.

Increased hospitalizations attributed to adverse drug reactions alone account for billions of dollars each year within the US healthcare system. Severe reactions do occur with the fluoroquinolone class and can add significantly to the cost of care. Antibacterial adverse effects account for nearly 25% of all adverse drug reactions amongst hospitalized patients. "Indirect costs as a result of reduced quality of life or loss of productivity are certainly not reflected in the acquisition costs of antimicrobials."<ref>{{cite journal
