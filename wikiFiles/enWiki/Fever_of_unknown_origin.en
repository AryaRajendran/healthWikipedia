'''Fever of unknown origin (FUO)''', '''pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)''' or '''febris e causa ignota (febris E.C.I.)''' refers to a condition in which the patient has an elevated temperature but despite investigations by a physician no explanation has been found.<ref name="Mandell">

If the cause is found it usually is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]], that is, by eliminating all possibilities until only one explanation remains, and taking this as the correct one.

== Definition ==
In 1961 Petersdorf and Beeson suggested the following criteria:<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/>
* Fever higher than 38.3°C (101°F) on several occasions
* Persisting without diagnosis for at least 3 weeks
* At least 1 week's investigation in hospital

A new definition which includes the outpatient setting (which reflects current medical practice) is broader, stipulating: 
*3 outpatient visits or 
*3 days in the hospital without elucidation of a cause or 
*1 week of "intelligent and invasive" ambulatory investigation.<ref name="Harrison"/>

Presently FUO cases are codified in four subclasses.
=== Classic FUO ===
This refers to the original classification by Petersdorf and Beeson. Studies show there are five categories of conditions: 
*[[infection]]s (e.g.  abscesses, [[endocarditis]], [[tuberculosis]], and complicated [[urinary tract infection]]s), 
*[[neoplasm]]s (e.g. [[lymphoma]]s, [[leukaemia]]s), 
*[[connective tissue disease]]s (e.g. [[temporal arteritis]] and [[polymyalgia rheumatica]], [[Still's disease]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], and [[rheumatoid arthritis]]), 
*miscellaneous disorders (e.g.  [[alcoholic hepatitis]], [[granuloma]]tous conditions), and 
*undiagnosed conditions.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Oxford"/>

===Nosocomial===
Nosocomial FUO refers to [[pyrexia]] in patients that have been admitted to hospital for at least 24 hours. This is commonly related to hospital associated factors such as, surgery, use of [[urinary catheter]], intravascular devices (i.e. "[[Peripheral venous catheter|drip]]", [[pulmonary artery catheter]]), drugs (antibiotics induced ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' colitis, and [[drug fever]]), immobilization (decubitus ulcers). [[Sinusitis]] in the [[intensive care unit]] is associated with nasogastric and orotracheal tubes.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/><ref name="Oxford"/> Other conditions that should be considered are deep-vein thrombophlebitis, and [[pulmonary embolism]], [[transfusion reaction]]s, acalculous cholecystitis, [[thyroiditis]], alcohol/drug withdrawal, [[adrenal insufficiency]], [[pancreatitis]].<ref name="Harrison"/>

===Immune-deficient===
Immunodeficiency can be seen in patients receiving [[chemotherapy]] or in hematologic malignancies. Fever is concomitant with [[neutropenia]] ([[neutrophil]] <500/uL) or impaired cell-mediated immunity. The lack of immune response masks a potentially dangerous course. Infection is the most common cause.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/><ref name="Oxford"/>

===Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated===
{{see|Human immunodeficiency virus}}

HIV-infected patients are a subgroup of the immunodeficient FUO, and frequently have fever. The primary phase shows fever since it has a [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]]-like illness. In advanced stages of infection fever mostly is the result of a superimposed infections.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/><ref name="Oxford"/>

===African hantavirus (Sangassou virus)===

In 2010, the first indigenous African hantavirus, Sangassou virus (SANGV) was isolated from an African wood mouse in a forest in [[Guinea]], [[West Africa]]. A retrospective seroepidemiological analysis revealed the presence of Sangassou virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in the sera of patients suffering from fever of unknown origin. <ref>Klempa B, Koivogui L, Sylla O et al. Serological evidence of human hantavirus infections in Guinea, West Africa. J Infect Dis 2010; 201: 1031–1034. | Article | PubMed |</ref><ref>Strecker, Jan ter Meulen and Detlev H. KrügerAuste, et al. Sangassou virus, the first hantavirus isolate from Africa. Journal of Virology2012, 86(7):3819. DOI: 10.1128/JVI.05879-11. </ref>

==Some important causes==
Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is the most frequent cause of FUO.<ref name="Harrison"/>
[[Drug-induced hyperthermia]], as sole symptom of an adverse reaction to medication, should always be considered. Disseminated granulomatoses such as [[Tuberculosis]], [[Histoplasmosis]], [[Coccidioidomycosis]], [[Blastomycosis]] and [[Sarcoidosis]] are associated with FUO. Lymphomas are the most common cause of FUO in adults. Thromboembolic disease (i.e. pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis) occasionally shows fever. Although infrequent, its potentially lethal consequences warrant evaluation of this cause. Endocarditis, although uncommon, is another important etiology to consider. An underestimated reason is factitious fever. Patients frequently are women that work, or have worked, in the medical field and have complex [[medical history|medical histories]].<ref name="Mandell"/><ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/fever-of-unknown-origin Fever of Unknown Origin] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A comprehensive and meticulous history (i.e. illness of family members, recent visit to the tropics, medication), repeated physical examination (i.e. [[skin rash]], [[eschar]], [[lymphadenopathy]], [[heart murmur]]) and myriad laboratory tests (serological, blood culture, immunological) are the cornerstone of finding the cause.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Oxford"/>

Other investigations may be needed. Ultrasound may show [[cholelithiasis]], [[echocardiography]] may be needed in suspected endocarditis and a CT-scan may show infection or malignancy of internal organs. Another technique is Gallium-67 scanning which seems to visualize chronic infections more effectively. Invasive techniques (biopsy and laparotomy for pathological and bacteriological examination) may be required before a definite diagnosis is possible.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Oxford"/>

[[Positron emission tomography]] using radioactively labelled [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG) has been reported to have a [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 84% and a [[Specificity (tests)| specificity]] of 86% for localizing the source of fever of unknown origin.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Meller J, Altenvoerde G, Munzel U, Jauho A, Behe M, Gratz S, Luig H, Becker W | title = Fever of unknown origin: prospective comparison of [18F]FDG imaging with a double-head coincidence camera and gallium-67 citrate SPET. | journal = Eur J Nucl Med. | volume = 27| issue = 11 | pages = 1617–25 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11105817 | doi = 10.1007/s002590000341}}</ref>

Despite all this, diagnosis may only be suggested by the therapy chosen. When a patient recovers after discontinuing medication it likely was [[drug fever]], when antibiotics or antimycotics work it probably was infection. Empirical therapeutic trials should be used in those patients in which other techniques have failed.<ref name="Mandell"/>

==Therapy==
Unless the patient is acutely ill, no therapy should be started before the cause has been found. This is because non-specific therapy rarely is effective and mostly delays diagnosis. An exception is made for neutropenic patients in which delay could lead to serious complications. After blood cultures are taken this condition is aggressively treated with  broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotics are adjusted according to the results of the cultures taken.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/><ref name="Oxford"/>

HIV-infected persons with pyrexia and [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], will be started on medication for possible [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' infection]]. Therapy is adjusted after a diagnosis is made.<ref name="Oxford"/>

==Prognosis==
Since there is a wide range of conditions associated with FUO, prognosis depends on the particular cause.<ref name="Mandell"/> If after 6 to 12 months no diagnosis is found, the chances diminish of ever finding a specific cause.<ref name="Oxford"/> However, under those circumstances prognosis is good.<ref name="Harrison"/>
