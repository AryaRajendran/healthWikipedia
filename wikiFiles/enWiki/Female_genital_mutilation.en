'''Female genital mutilation''' ('''FGM'''), also known as '''female genital cutting''' ('''FGC''') and '''female circumcision''' ('''FC'''), is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."<ref name=WHO1>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html "Female genital mutilation"], World Health Organization, February 2013.</ref> According to the WHO, it is practiced mainly in 28 countries in western, eastern, and north-eastern Africa, and in parts of Asia and the Middle East.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf "Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation"], World Health Organization, 2008, p. 4.

Female genital mutilation is believed to have originated in the [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] period amongst [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] (Hamito-Semitic) communities inhabiting the [[Red Sea]] area, from where it later spread to other regions.<ref name="Rushwan"/> It is typically carried out on girls between four years old and puberty, although it is also conducted on younger infants and on adults.<ref name=toubia1994>Toubia, Nahid.

The WHO has offered four classifications of FGM, Types I–IV.<ref name=WHOterminology>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf "Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation"], World Health Organization, 2008, pp. 4, 22–28.

*'''Type I''': removal of the [[clitoral hood]], almost invariably accompanied by removal of the [[clitoris]] ([[clitoridectomy]]).
*'''Type II''' (also known as excision): removal of the clitoris and [[labia minora|inner labia]].
*'''Type III''' (also known as [[infibulation]]): removal of all or part of the inner and [[labia majora|outer labia]], and usually the clitoris, and the fusion of the wound, leaving a small hole for the passage of urine and menstrual blood – the fused wound is opened for intercourse and childbirth.<ref name=Momoh6>[[Comfort Momoh|Momoh, Comfort]]. ''Female Genital Mutilation''. Radcliffe Publishing, 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA6 pp. 6–7].</ref>
*'''Type IV''': miscellaneous procedures ranging from a symbolic pricking or piercing of the clitoris or labia, to cauterization of the clitoris, cutting into the vagina to widen it ([[gishiri cutting]]), and introducing corrosive substances to tighten it.<ref name=Momoh6/>

According to the WHO, the practice is rooted in gender inequality and ideas about the need to control women and their sexuality; in communities that practice it, it is typically supported by both women and men.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf "Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation"], World Health Organization, 2008, p. 5.

:*"One of the great achievements of the past decade in the field of FGM is the shift in emphasis from the concern over the harmful physical effects it causes to understanding this act as a social phenomenon resulting from a gender definition of women's roles, in particular their sexual and reproductive roles. This shift in emphasis has helped redefine the issues from a clinical disease model ... to a problem resulting from the use of culture to protect social dominance over women's bodies by the patriarchal hierarchy."</ref> Opposition to it focuses on the rights violations, lack of informed consent and health consequences, which can include recurrent [[Urinary tract infection|urinary]] and vaginal infections, chronic pain, infertility, fatal [[Bleeding|hemorrhaging]], the development of [[epidermoid cyst]]s, and [[Obstetric labor complication|complications during childbirth]]. There have been efforts by international bodies since 1979 to end the practice, and in 2012 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] unanimously passed a resolution banning it.<ref>[http://www.unwomen.org/2012/12/united-nations-bans-female-genital-mutilation/ "United Nations bans female genital mutilation"], UN Women, 20 December 2012.</ref> [[Sylvia Tamale]], a Ugandan legal scholar, writes that there is a large body of research and activism in Africa that strongly opposes FGM, but she cautions that some African feminists object to what she calls the imperialist infantilization of African women, and the idea that FGM is nothing but a barbaric rejection of modernity. Tamale suggests that there are cultural and political aspects to the practice's continuation that make opposition to it a complex issue.<ref>[[Sylvia Tamale|Tamale, Sylvia]].

==Background==
=== Terminology ===
The procedures known as FGM were referred to as ''female circumcision'' (FM) until the early 1980s, when the term ''female genital mutilation'' came into use.<ref>Rahman and Toubia 2000, p. x.</ref> That term was adopted at the third conference of the [[Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children]] in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and in 1991 the WHO recommended its use to the United Nations.<ref name=WHOterminology/> It has since become the dominant term within the international community and in medical literature.<ref name=Nussbaum119/> Alexia Lewnes argued in a 2005 report for UNICEF that the word ''mutilation'' differentiates the procedure from [[male circumcision]] and stresses its severity.<ref>Lewnes, Alexia (ed.). [http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf "Changing a harmful social convention: female genital cutting/mutilation"], ''Innocenti Digest'', UNICEF, 2005, pp. 1–2.</ref>

Medical or elective procedures such as [[labiaplasty]] and [[vaginoplasty]], or those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]], are not regarded as examples of FGM. According to the WHO, some elective practices in countries that have outlawed FGM do fall under the category of Type IV FGM (see [[#Type IV|below]]), but the WHO decided to maintain its broad definition to avoid loopholes that could allow FGM to continue.<ref name=WHOterminology/>

Other terms in use include ''female genital cutting'' (FGC), ''female genital surgeries'', ''female genital alteration'', ''female genital excision'', and ''female genital modification''.<ref>For "female genital modification," see Gallo, Pia Grassivaro; Tita Eleanora; and Viviani, Franco. [http://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-4916-3_4 "At the Roots of Ethnic Female Genital Modification,"] in Denniston, George C. and Gallo, Pia Grassivaro. ''Bodily Integrity and the Politics of Circumcision''. Springer, 2006, pp. 49–50.
*For the rest, see Momoh 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA6 p. 6].</ref> Elizabeth Heger Boyle writes that some organizations refer to it as FGC because the communities that practise it do not see themselves as engaging in mutilation; she writes that state-sponsored groups tend to call it FGM, while private groups use FGC.<ref>Boyle 2002, p. 60ff.
*Also see Shell-Duncan, Bettina; Hernlund, Ylva (eds). ''Female "Circumcision" in Africa''. Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2000, p. 6.</ref> Other groups, such as [[UNFPA]] and [[USAID]], use the combined term ''female genital mutilation/cutting'' (FGM/C).<ref>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/techareas/fgc/annex.html "Annex to USAID Policy on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C): Explanation of Terminology"], USAID, 2000.</ref>

Local terms for the procedure include ''tahara'' in Egypt; ''tahur'' in Sudan; and ''bolokoli'' in Mali, which Anika Rahman and [[Nahid Toubia]] write are words synonymous with purification. Several countries refer to Type 1 FGM as ''sunna circumcision''.<ref>Rahman and Toubia 2000, p. 4.</ref> It is also known as ''kakia'', and in Sierra Leone as ''bundu'', after the [[Sande society|Bundu secret society]].<ref>For ''kakia'', see [[Fauziya Kassindja|Kasinga, Fauziya]], and [[Layli Miller-Muro|Bashir, Layli Miller]].

===History===
{{Main|Religious views on female genital mutilation}}
Female genital mutilation in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is believed to have its origins in ancient cultural ceremonies performed by [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] (Hamito-Semitic) communities inhabiting the [[Red Sea]] area. Cultural transmission and migrations from this core region subsequently introduced the custom to other populations, from where it again dispersed.<ref name="Rushwan">Rushwan, Hamid. ''Female Circumcision in the Sudan: Prevalence, Complications, Attitudes, and Change''. Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, 1983, p. 38.</ref>

The term "pharaonic circumcision" (Type III) stems from its practice in [[Ancient Egypt]] under the [[Pharaoh]]s, and "fibula" (in "infibulation") refers to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] practice of piercing the outer labia with a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]], or brooch.<ref name=James/> Leonard Kouba and Judith Muasher write that genitally mutilated females have been found among Egyptian [[Mummy|mummies]], and that [[Herodotus]] (c. 484 BCE – c. 425 BCE) referred to the practice when he visited Egypt. There is reference on a Greek [[papyrus]] from 163 BCE to the procedure being conducted on girls in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the ancient Egyptian capital.<ref name=Kouba>Kouba, Leonard and Muascher, Judith. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/524569 "Female Circumcision in Africa: An Overview"], ''African Studies Review'', 28(1), March 1985 (pp. 95–110), p. 95.</ref> After having visited Ethiopia in the second century BCE, during the reign of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], the Greek historian [[Agatharchides]] likewise asserted that the kindred people he encountered there already circumcised their women in the Egyptian tradition.<ref name="Suggs">Suggs, David N. and Miracle, Andrew W. ''Culture and Human Sexuality: A Reader''. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co., 1993, p. 34.</ref> Another Greek geographer, [[Strabo]] (c. 64 BCE – c. 23 CE), later reported having also witnessed the practice when he traveled to Egypt in 25 BCE.<ref name=Kouba/>

On this basis, Asim Zaki Mustafa argues that the common attribution of the procedure to Islam is unfair because it is a much older phenomenon.<ref name=Mustafa>Mustafa, Asim Zaki. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-0528.1966.tb05163.x/abstract "Female circumcision and infibulation in the Sudan"], ''Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology'', 73(2), 1966 (pp. 302–306), p. 302.</ref> Islamic scholars have said that, while male circumcision is a ''sunna'', or religious obligation, FGM is not, and several have issued a ''fatwa'' against Type III FGM.<ref>Gruenbaum, Ellen.

University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001, p. 63.</ref> Judaism requires circumcision for boys, but does not allow it for girls.<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/JewishEnc/ "Circumcision"], in R.J. Zwi Werblowsky, R. J. and Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.). ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion''. Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref>

Gynaecologists in England and the United States in the 19th century would remove the clitoris to treat insanity, masturbation and nymphomania.<ref>Momoh 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA5 p. 5].</ref> The first reported clitoridectomy in the West was carried out in 1822 by a surgeon in Berlin on a teenage girl regarded as an "[[imbecile]]" who was masturbating.<ref name=pmid9326757>Elchalal, Uriel; Ben-Ami, Barbara; Gillis, Rebecca; and Brzezinski, Amnon.

===Reasons for the practice===
Reasons for practicing FGM vary.<ref name="Awoiv">[http://www.african-women.org/FGM/myths.php "Myths and Justifications for the Perpetuation of FGM"], African Women's Organization in Vienna, 2009.</ref> Generally, it is considered by its practitioners to be an essential part of raising a girl properly.<ref name="WHO1" /> In some societies, circumcision is also performed to clearly differentiate between the genders on the belief that the clitoris of a girl confers upon her masculinity and the foreskin of a boy makes him feminine.<ref name="Awoiv"/> According to the WHO, the procedure ensures pre-marital virginity and inhibits extra-marital sex, because it reduces women's [[libido]]. Women fear the pain of re-opening the vagina, and are afraid of being discovered if it is opened illicitly.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html "Female genital mutilation"], World Health Organization, February 2013:
*"FGM is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl properly, and a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage.<p>FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital virginity and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist 'illicit' sexual acts. When a vaginal opening is covered or narrowed (type 3 above), the fear of the pain of opening it, and the fear that this will be found out, is expected to further discourage 'illicit' sexual intercourse among women with this type of FGM.<p>FGM is associated with cultural ideals of femininity and modesty, which include the notion that girls are 'clean' and 'beautiful' after removal of body parts that are considered 'male' or "unclean."</ref> 

In [[Northeast Africa]] FGM is encouraged by women in the community, and is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.<ref name="Frayser"> Frayser, Suzanne G. and Whitby, J.  ''Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide''. Libraries Unlimited, 1995, p. 257.</ref> Sudanese surgeon [[Nahid Toubia]] – president of [[RAINBO]] (Research, Action and Information Network for the Bodily Integrity of Women) – said in 2002 that campaigning against FGM involved trying to change women's consciousness: "By allowing your genitals to be removed [it is perceived that] you are heightened to another level of pure motherhood – a motherhood not tainted by sexuality and that is why the woman gives it away to become the matron, respected by everyone. By taking on this practice, which is a woman's domain, it actually empowers them. It is much more difficult to convince the women to give it up, than to convince the men."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1916917.stm "Changing attitudes to female circumcision"], BBC News, 8 April 2002.

[[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups in the [[African Great Lakes]] region have through interaction adopted various customs from neighboring Afro-Asiatic populations, including in some communities the practise of female and male circumcision.<ref name="Collins">Robert O. Collins, ''The southern Sudan in historical perspective'', (Transaction Publishers: 2006), p.9-10.</ref> Elizabeth Heger Boyle writes that the [[Maasai people|Masai]] Nilotes of Tanzania will not call a woman "mother" when she has children if she is uncircumcised.<ref>Boyle, Elizabeth Heger. ''Female Genital Cutting: Cultural Conflict in the Global Community''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002, p. 37.</ref>

According to Amnesty, in certain societies women who have not had the procedure are regarded as too unclean to handle food and water, and there is a belief that a woman's genitals might continue to grow without FGM, until they dangle between her legs. Some groups see the clitoris as dangerous, capable of killing a man if his penis touches it, or a baby if the head comes into contact with it during birth.<ref name=Amnesty1997report>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT77/006/1997/en/3ed9f8e9-e984-11dd-8224-a709898295f2/act770061997en.html "What is female genital mutilation?], Amnesty International, AI Index: ACT 77/06/97, accessed September 3, 2011.</ref>

The age at which the procedure is performed varies. [[Comfort Momoh]], a specialist midwife in England, writes that in Ethiopia the [[Falashas#Falash Mura|Falashas]] perform it when the child is a few days old, the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] on the eighth day of birth, while the Adere and [[Oromo people|Oromo]] choose between four years and puberty. In Somalia it is done between four and nine years. Other communities may wait until adulthood, she writes, either just before marriage or just after the first pregnancy. It may be carried out on one girl alone, or on a group of girls at the same time.<ref name=Momoh2>Momoh 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA2 p. 2].</ref>

The procedure is generally performed by a traditional circumciser, usually an older woman known as a "gedda," without anaesthesia or sterile equipment, though richer families may pay instead for the services of a nurse, midwife, or doctor using a local anaesthetic. It may also be performed by the mother or grandmother, or in some countries – such as Nigeria and Egypt – by the local male barber.<ref name=pmid9326757/>

The WHO divides FGM into four categories (see image below right for types I–III).<ref name=WHOterminology/> Around 85 percent of women experience Types I and II, and 15 percent Type III. [[Martha Nussbaum]] writes that Type III accounts for 80–90 percent of all such procedures in countries such as Sudan, Somalia, and Dijbouti.<ref name=Nussbaum119>Nussbaum, Martha Craven. "Judging Other Cultures: The Case of Genital Mutilation," ''Sex and Social Justice''. Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 119–120.</ref> 

=== Types I and II ===
[[File:FGC Types.svg|thumb|200px|alt=diagram|Different types of FGM and how they differ from normal female anatomy]]
Type I is the removal of the [[clitoral hood]] (Type Ia); or the partial or total removal of the clitoris, a [[clitoridectomy]] (Type Ib).<ref name=WHOterminology/> Type II, often called excision, is partial or total removal of the clitoris and the [[labia minora|inner labia]] or [[labia majora|outer labia]]. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia only; Type IIb, partial or total removal of the clitoris and the inner labia; and Type IIc, partial or total removal of the clitoris, and the inner and outer labia.<ref name=WHOterminology/>

=== Type III ===
Type III, commonly called [[infibulation]] or pharaonic circumcision, is the removal of all external genitalia. The inner and outer labia are cut away, with or without excision of the clitoris.<ref name=WHO2006/> The girl's legs are then tied together from hip to ankle for up to 40 days to allow the wound to heal. The immobility causes the labial tissue to bond, forming a wall of flesh and skin across the entire [[vulva]], apart from a hole the size of a matchstick for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, which is created by inserting a twig or rock salt into the wound.<ref name="Elmusharaf2006" /><ref>For the legs being bound for 40 days, and the opening the size of a matchstick, see for example [http://web.archive.org/web/20080112051948/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10222.pdf "Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC): Individual Country Reports"], U.S. Department of State, 1 June 2001, p. 14.

:*A French doctor, Jacques Lantier, who attended an FGM procedure in Somalia in the 1970s described how the inner and outer labia were separated and attached to each thigh using large thorns. "With her kitchen knife the woman then pierces and slices open the hood of the clitoris and then begins to cut it out. While another woman wipes off the blood with a rag, the operator digs with her fingernail a hole the length of the clitoris to detach and pull out that organ. The little girls screams in extreme pain, but no one pays the slightest attention."<p>After removing the clitoris with the knife, the woman "lifts up the skin that is left with her thumb and index finger to remove the remaining flesh. She then digs a deep hole amidst the gushing blood. The neighbor women who take part in the operation then plunge their fingers into the bloody hole to verify that every remnant of the clitoris is removed."</ref> There is another form of Type III called ''matwasat'', where the stitching of the vulva is less extreme and the hole left is bigger.<ref name=James>James, Stanlie M. "Female Genital Mutilation," in Bonnie G. Smith. ''The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Women in World History''. Oxford University Press, 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&lpg=PA259 pp. 259–262].</ref> Momoh describes a Type III procedure in ''Female Genital Mutilation'' (2005):

{{quote| In Type 3 excision or infibulation ... elderly women, relatives and friends secure the girl in the [[lithotomy position]]. A deep incision is made rapidly on either side from the root of the clitoris to the [[Frenulum of labia minora|fourchette]], and a single cut of the razor excises the clitoris and both the labia majora and labia minora.

Bleeding is profuse, but is usually controlled by the application of various [[poultice]]s, the threading of the edges of the skin with thorns, or clasping them between the edges of a split cane. A piece of twig is inserted between the edges of the skin to ensure a patent [[foramen]] for urinary and menstrual flow. The lower limbs are then bound together for 2–6 weeks to promote [[Hemostasis|haemostatis]] and encourage union of the two sides...

Healing takes place by [[primary intention]], and, as a result, the [[introitus]] is obliterated by a drum of skin extending across the orifice except for a small hole. Circumstances at the time may vary; the girl may struggle ferociously, in which case the incisions may become uncontrolled and haphazard. The girl may be pinned down so firmly that bones may fracture.<ref name=Momoh6/>}}

The vulva is cut open for sexual intercourse and childbirth. Momoh writes that, in some communities, when a pregnant woman who has not experienced FGM goes into labour, the procedure is performed before she gives birth, because it is believed the baby may be stillborn if it touches her clitoris. The risk of haemorrhage and death from FGM during labour is high, she writes.<ref>Momoh 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA24 pp. 24–25].</ref> During three six-month studies in the 1980s, Hanny Lightfoot-Klein interviewed 300 Sudanese women and 100 Sudanese men, and described the penetration by the men of their wives' infibulation (Type III):

{{quote|The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place. A great deal of marital anal intercourse takes place in cases where the wife can not be penetrated – quite logically in a culture where homosexual anal intercourse is a commonly accepted premarital recourse among men – but this is not readily discussed. Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the "little knife." This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis. In some women, the scar tissue is so hardened and overgrown with keloidal formations that it can only be cut with very strong surgical scissors, as is reported by doctors who relate cases where they broke [[scalpel]]s in the attempt.<ref name=Lightfoot>Lightfoot-Klein, Hanny.

=== Type IV ===
A variety of other procedures are collectively known as Type IV, which the WHO defines as "all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example, pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization." This ranges from ritual nicking of the clitoris – the main practice in Indonesia – to stretching the clitoris or labia, burning or scarring the genitals, or introducing harmful substances into the vagina to tighten it.<ref name=WHOterminology/> It also includes [[hymenotomy]], the removal of a [[hymen]] regarded as too thick, and [[gishiri cutting]], a practice in which the vagina's anterior wall is cut with a knife to enlarge it.<ref name=James/>

=== Immediate and late complications===
FGM is typically carried out by traditional practitioners, without anaesthesia, using unsterile cutting devices such as knives, razors, scissors, cut glass, sharpened rocks, and fingernails, and applying suturing material such as [[agave]] or [[acacia]] thorns.<ref name=Abdulcadira>Abdulcadira, Jasmine, ''et al''. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21213149 "Care of women with female genital mutilation/cutting"], ''Swiss Medical Weekly'', 6(14), January 2011.
*For the list of instruments, see Kelly, Elizabeth, and Hillard, Paula J. Adams.

FGM has immediate and late complications. Immediate complications are increased when FGM is performed in traditional ways, and without access to medical resources: the procedure is extremely painful and a [[hemorrhage|bleeding complication]] can be fatal. Other immediate complications include acute [[urinary retention]], [[urinary infection]], [[wound infection]], [[septicemia]], [[tetanus]], and in case of unsterile and reused instruments, [[hepatitis]] and [[HIV]].<ref name=Abdulcadira/> According to Lewnes' UNICEF report, it is unknown how many girls and women die from the procedure because "few records are kept" and fatalities caused by FGM "are rarely reported as such".<ref>Lewnes, Alexia (ed.). [http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf "Changing a harmful social convention: female genital cutting/mutilation"], ''Innocenti Digest'', UNICEF, 2005, p. 16.</ref> Momoh writes that the short-term mortality rate is around 10 percent, due to complications such as infection, haemorrhage, and [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]].<ref>Momoh 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA7 p. 7].</ref> A film shot in [[Lunsar]], Sierra Leone, by [[Mariana van Zeller]] in 2007 discusses how girls who bleed excessively are regarded as witches.<ref>Van Zeller, Mariana.

Late complications may vary depending on the type of FGM performed.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> The formation of scars and [[keloid]]s can lead to strictures, obstruction or fistula formation of the urinary and genital tracts. Urinary tract sequalae include damage to urethra and bladder with infections and [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]]. Genital tract sequelae include vaginal and pelvic infections, [[dysmenorrhea]], [[dyspareunia]], and [[infertility]].
<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Elizabeth, and Hillard, Paula J. Adams.

FGM may complicate pregnancy and place women at higher risk for obstetrical problems, which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> Thus, in women with Type III FGM who have developed [[Vesicovaginal fistula|vesicovaginal]] or [[Rectovaginal fistula|rectovaginal fistulae]] – holes that allows urine and feces to seep into the vagina – it is difficult to obtain clear urine samples as part of prenatal care making the diagnosis of certain conditions harder, such as [[preeclampsia]].<ref name="Kelly"/> Cervical evaluation during labour may be impeded, and labour prolonged. Third-degree laceration, anal sphincter damage, and emergency caesarean section are more common in FGM women than in controls.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> [[Neonatal mortality]] is increased in women with FGM. The WHO estimated that an additional 10–20 babies die per 1,000 deliveries as a result of FGM; the estimate was based on a 2006 study conducted on 28,393 women attending delivery wards at 28 obstetric centers in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. In those settings all types of FGM were found to pose an increased risk of death to the baby: 15 percent higher for Type I, 32 percent for Type II, and 55 percent for Type III.<ref name=WHO2006>Banks E. ''et al''.

Psychological complications are related to cultural context; damage may occur to women who undergo FGM particularly when they are moving outside their traditional circles and are confronted with a view that mutilation is not the norm.<ref name=Abdulcadira/>  Women with FGM typically report sexual dysfunction and [[dyspareunia]] (painful sexual intercourse), but several researchers have written that FGM does not necessarily destroy sexual desire in women. Boyle reported several studies during the 1980s and 1990s where the women said they were able to enjoy sex, though with Type III the risk of sexual dysfunction was higher.<ref>Boyle 2002, pp. 34–35.</ref>

===Reinfibulation and defibulation===
Women may request reinfibulation (RI) – the restoration of the infibulation – after giving birth, a contentious issue, with surgeons who perform the procedure regarded as behaving unethically and probably illegally.<ref name=toubia1994>Toubia, Nahid.

Two cuts are made around the vagina, then sutures are put in place to tighten it to the size of a pinhole. Vanja Bergrren writes that this in effect mimics virginity. RI may also be carried out just before marriage, after divorce, or even in elderly women to prepare them for death.<ref>Bergrren, Vanja et al.

==Prevalence and attempts to end the practice==
===Practising countries===
====Overview====
[[File:Fgm map.svg|thumb|alt=map|Prevalence of FGM in Africa]]
{{FGM}}
{{main|Prevalence of female genital mutilation by country}}
According to the WHO, 140 million women and girls are living with the effects of FGM, including 101 million girls over the age of 10 in Africa. The practice persists in 28 African countries, in an area extending westward from [[Northeast Africa]] to the [[Sahel]].<ref name=WHO1/> Caldwell, Orubuloye and Caldwell (2000) write that between 80 and 88 percent of women in Africa who have experienced FGM live in sub-Saharan Africa, 51 percent in West Africa and 27 percent in Nigeria.<ref name=Caldwell2000p235>Caldwell, John C.; Orubuloye, I.O.; and Caldwell, Pat. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/40230269 "Female Genital Mutilation: Conditions of Decline"], ''Population Research and Policy Review'', 19(3), June 2000 (pp. 233–254), p. 235.</ref> 

In Africa most of the girls who undergo the procedure (around two million a year) live in sub-Saharan and north-eastern Africa, according to Plan International. In West Africa, almost all women in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Mali have undergone FGM, mostly Type II; in other West African countries such as Niger and Ghana around 10 percent have.<ref>[http://plan-international.org/files/global/publications/protection/femalecutting.pdf "Tradition and Rights: Female Genital Cutting in West Africa"], Plan International, 2005, pp. 6–7.</ref> The procedure can be carried out shortly after birth, at puberty, or even when a woman is pregnant for the first time.<ref>Mandara, M.U. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15001386 "Female genital mutilation in Nigeria"], ''International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics'', 84(3), March 2004, pp. 291–298.</ref>
 
Reasons for the practice include a mix of cultural, religious and social factors within families and communities, which vary from country to country, and region to region.<ref>Kouba, Leonard and Muascher, Judith. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/524569 "Female Circumcision in Africa: An Overview"], ''African Studies Review'', 28(1), March 1985, pp. 95–110.

"Female genital mutilation: Have we made progress?"], ''International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics'', 82(3) September 2003, pp. 251–261.</ref> In some cultures, there are economic advantages to having the procedure; girls who undergo FGM are showered with gifts from the community, which provides an additional motivation.<ref name=Warop>[http://plan-international.org/files/global/publications/protection/femalecutting.pdf "Tradition and Rights: Female Genital Cutting in West Africa"], Plan International, 2005.</ref>

FGM predates the infiltration of Islam and Christianity in West African cultures. As syncretism occurred, some West Africans argued that the practice was a religious one. This brought on the misconception that FGM is a religious practice, mainly an Islamic one. Although the likelihood of having been circumcised increases with the Muslim population, this does not mean that the entire religion condones the practice, and Muslim leaders have campaigned for its abandonment.<ref>Wakabi, Wairagala. [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)60508-X/fulltext  "Africa battles to make female genital mutilation history"], ''The Lancet'', 369 (9567), 31 March 2007, pp. 1069–1070.</ref>

Outside Africa, the procedure occurs in northern Saudi Arabia, southern Jordan, northern Iraq ([[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan]]), and possibly Syria, western Iran, and southern Turkey.<ref name=Birch>Birch, Nicholas. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0810/p06s01-woiq.html  "Female circumcision surfaces in Iraq"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 10 August 2005.</ref> It is practised in Indonesia, but largely symbolically by pricking the clitoral hood or clitoris until it bleeds.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20021027193752/http://www.state.gov/g/wi/rls/rep/crfgm/10102.htm "Indonesia: Report on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC)"], U.S. Department of State, 1 June 2001.</ref> 

====Opposition====
=====Colonial opposition in Kenya=====
{{see|Female circumcision controversy (Kenya, 1929–1932)}}
Anika Rahman and Nahid Toubia write that attempts in the early 20th century by colonial administrators to halt FGM succeeded only in provoking local anger.<ref name=Rahman9>Rahman and Toubia 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=kEG6GaudxQEC&pg=PA9 pp. 9–10].</ref> In Kenya, Christian missionaries in the 1920s and 1930s forbade their adherents from practising it – in part because of the medical consequences, but also because the accompanying rituals were seen as highly sexualized – and as a result it became a focal point of the independence movement among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the country's main ethnic group.<ref>Natsoulas, Theodore. [http://jas.sagepub.com/content/33/2/137.citation "The Politicization of the Ban of Female Circumcision and the Rise of the Independent School Movement in Kenya: The KCA, the Missions and Government, 1929–1932"], ''Journal of African Studies'', 33(2), April 1998, pp. 137–158.

Historian Lynn M. Thomas writes that the period 1929–1931 became known in Kenyan historiography as the [[female circumcision controversy]]. Protestant missionaries campaigning against it tried to gain support from humanitarian and women's rights groups in London, where the issue was raised in the House of Commons, and in Kenya itself a person's stance toward FGM became a test of loyalty, either to the Christian churches or to the [[Kikuyu Central Association]].<ref name=Thomas2000/> Jomo Kenyatta (c. 1894–1978), who became Kenya's first prime minister in 1963, wrote in 1930:

{{quote|The real argument lies not in the defense of the general surgical operation or its details, but in the understanding of a very important fact in the tribal psychology of the Kikuyu – namely, that this operation is still regarded as the essence of an institution which has enormous educational, social, moral and religious implications, quite apart from the operation itself. For the present it is impossible for a member of the tribe to imagine an initiation without clitoridoctomy [sic]. Therefore the ... abolition of the surgical element in this custom means ... the abolition of the whole institution.<ref name=Mufaka>Mufaka, Kenneth. [http://www.irss.uoguelph.ca/article/viewFile/176/218 "Scottish Missionaries and the Circumcision Controversy in Kenya, 1900–1960"], ''International Review of Scottish Studies'', vol 28, 2003.</ref>}}

Support for the practice also came from the women themselves. E. Mary Holding, a Methodist missionary in [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]], Kenya, wrote in 1942 that the ritual was an entirely female affair, organized by women's councils known as ''kiama gia ntonye'' ("the council of entering"). The procedure saw the girls become women, and allowed their mothers to become members of the women's council, a position of authority.<ref name=Thomas2000/>

Similarly, prohibition strengthened tribal resistance to the British in the 1950s, and increased support for the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] (1952–1960).<ref name=BirchTime>Birch, Nicholas. [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1700191,00.html "An End to Female Genital Cutting?"], ''Time'' magazine, 4 January 2008.</ref> In 1956, under pressure from the British, the council of male elders (the ''Njuri Nchecke'') in Meru, Kenya, announced a ban on clitoridectomy. Over two thousand girls – mostly teenagers, but some as young as eight – were charged over the next three years with having carried out the procedure on each other with razor blades, a practice that came to be known as ''Ngaitana'' ("I will circumcise myself"), so-called because the girls claimed to have cut themselves to avoid naming their friends.<ref name=Thomas2000/> [[Sylvia Tamale]] argues that this was done not only in defiance of the council's cooperation with the colonial authorities, but also in protest against its interference with women's decisions about their own rituals.<ref>Tamale 2011, p. 89.

=====Since the 1960s=====
{{further|Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, Rahman and Nahid Toubia write, doctors in Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria began to speak out about the health consequences of FGM, and opposition gathered pace during the United Nations Decade for Women (1975–1985). In 1979 the American feminist writer [[Fran Hosken]] (1920–2006) presented research about it – ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females'' – to the first Seminar on Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, sponsored by the WHO. Rahman and Toubia write that African women from several countries at the conference led a vote to end the practice.<ref name=Rahman9/>

[[File:Nawal-el-saadavi.jpg|right|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|[[Nawal El Saadawi]], the Egyptian feminist physician, spoke out against FGM in 1980.<ref name=Thomas2000/>]]
In 1980 and 1982 feminist physicians [[Nawal El Saadawi]] and Asma El Dareer wrote about FGM as a dangerous practice intended to control women's sexuality.<ref name=Thomas2000>Thomas, Lynn M. "'Ngaitana (I will circumcise myself)': Lessons from Colonial Campaigns to Ban Excision in Meru, Kenya"], in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&pg=PA129 p. 129ff].</ref> The decade also saw the framing of FGM – along with other issues in the domestic sphere, such as [[dowry death]]s – as a human rights violation, rather than as a health concern, and this encouraged academic interest, including from feminist legal scholars.<ref name=Rahman9/> In June 1993 the Vienna [[World Conference on Human Rights]] agreed that FGM was a violation of human rights.<ref name=toubia1994/>

Several African countries have enacted legislation against it, including Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Togo, and Uganda.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080113175522/http://www.state.gov/g/wi/rls/rep/crfgm/ "Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC): Individual Country Reports"], U.S. Department of State, 1 June 2001.</ref> President [[Daniel Moi]] of Kenya issued a decree against it in December 2001.<ref>Momoh 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA15 p. 15].</ref> The 2003 Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights of Women in Africa, or the [[Maputo Protocol]], was passed in November 2005, meaning that all African countries are obliged to pass legislation prohibiting FGM.<ref name=Au>[http://www.achpr.org/protocol_women_maputo_final03.doc1 "Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa"], African Commission on Human and People's Rights.<!--redirected link, not in Internet Archive--></ref> 

In Egypt, the Health Ministry banned FGM in 2007 despite pressure from some Islamic groups. Two issues in particular forced the government's hand. A 10-year-old girl was photographed undergoing FGM in a barber's shop in Cairo in 1995 and the images were broadcast by CNN; this triggered a ban on the practice everywhere except in hospitals. Then in 2007 12-year-old Badour Shaker died of an overdose of anaesthesia during or after an FGM procedure for which her mother had paid a physician in an illegal clinic the equivalent of $9.00. The [[Al-Azhar]] Supreme Council of Islamic Research, the highest religious authority in Egypt, issued a statement that FGM had no basis in core Islamic law, and this enabled the government to outlaw it entirely.<ref name=Michael>Michael, Maggie.

=====Criticism of the opposition=====
Some of the international opposition to FGM has attracted critics. ''The Hosken Report'', in particular, was criticized for its alleged [[ethnocentrism]], its negative statements about African society, and its insistence on Western intervention.<ref name=Shell160/> Sylvia Tamale wrote in 2011 that some African feminists interpret traditional practices such as FGM within a post-colonial context that makes opposing them a complex issue. While critical of FGM, they object to what Tamale calls the imperialist infantilization of African women inherent in the idea that FGM is simply a barbaric rejection of enlightenment and modernity.<ref>Tamale 2011, pp. 19–20, 78.</ref>

Lynn Thomas writes that the ritual of FGM has been the primary context in some communities in which the women come together. Because they see it as a way of elevating themselves from girlhood to womanhood, and thereby a way of differentiating between each other, Thomas argues that to remove FGM is to remove that opportunity to gain authority. She writes that the "eradicationists" have responded to these criticisms by reaching out to the African communities and strengthening their relationships with local anti-FGM activists.<ref name=Thomas2000/> For example, one of the issues that keeps FGM going in some communities is that the practitioners have no other way to earn a living. Organizations working to end it are therefore offering the women training of some kind; teaching them how to become farmers, for example.<ref>Van Zeller, Mariana.

===Non-practicing countries===
{{further|Tahirih Justice Center}}
As a result of immigration, FGM spread to Australia, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, and the United States. As Western governments became more aware of the practice, legislation was passed to make it a criminal offence, though enforcement may be a low priority.

In the United States, 19-year-old [[Matter of Kasinga|Fauziya Kasinga]], a member of the Tchamba-Kunsuntu tribe of Togo, was granted asylum in 1996 after leaving an arranged marriage to escape FGM; this set a precedent in US immigration law because it was the first time FGM was accepted as a form of persecution.<ref>Dugger, Celia W.

Whether someone performs FGM within the United States or knowingly transports a girl out of the country for the purpose of undergoing FGM, the penalty is up to five years in prison. FGM is also a crime, with varying penalties, in 20 states: California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin. {{fact|date=April 2013}}-->

In the United Kingdom, the [[Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985]] outlawed the procedure in Britain itself, and the [[Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003]] and [[Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005]] made it an offence for FGM to be performed anywhere in the world on British citizens or permanent residents.<ref name=McVeigh/> ''The Times'' reported in 2009 that there are 500 victims of FGM every year in the UK, but there have been no prosecutions. According to the [[Foundation for Women's Health, Research and Development]] (FORWARD) – founded in 1983 by [[Efua Dorkenoo]], a Ghanaian campaigner against FGM – 66,000 women in England and Wales have experienced FGM, with 7,000 girls at risk. Families who have immigrated from practising countries may send their daughters back there to undergo FGM, ostensibly to visit a relative, or may fly in circumcisers, who are known as "house doctors" because they conduct the procedure in people's homes.<ref name=Kerjab>Kerbaj, Richard.
