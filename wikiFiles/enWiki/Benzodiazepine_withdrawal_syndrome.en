'''Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome'''—often abbreviated to '''benzo withdrawal'''—is the cluster of [[Withdrawal|symptoms]] that emerge when a person who has taken [[benzodiazepine]]s has developed a physical [[benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]] and undergoes dosage reduction or discontinuation. It is characterized by often severe sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and [[anxiety]], [[panic attacks]], hand tremor, sweating, difficulty in concentration, confusion and cognitive difficulty, memory problems, dry retching and nausea, weight loss, [[palpitations]], headache, muscular pain and stiffness, a host of perceptual changes, [[hallucinations]], [[seizures]], [[psychosis]],<ref name=Petursson>{{cite journal|last=Petursson|first=H|title=The benzodiazepeine withdrawal syndrom|journal=Addiction|year=1994|volume=89|issue=11|pages=1455–1459|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1994.tb03743.x|pmid=7841856}}</ref> and suicide<ref name=pdatheagtcau/> (see "Signs and Symptoms" section below for full list).

Chronic exposure to benzodiazepines causes neural adaptations that counteract the drug's effects, leading to [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence|dependence]].<ref name="Allison-2003" />  Despite taking a constant therapeutic dose, long-term use of benzodiazepines may lead to the emergence of withdrawal-like symptoms, particularly between doses.<ref>{{cite journal| journal =J Clin Psychiatry | year =1987 | month =October | volume =48 Suppl | pages =22–8| title =Rebound anxiety in panic disorder patients treated with shorter-acting benzodiazepines | author =Herman JB | coauthors =Brotman AW, Rosenbaum JF | pmid =2889722}}</ref>  When the drug is discontinued or the dosage reduced, [[withdrawal symptoms]] may appear and remain until the body reverses the physiological adaptations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allgulander C, Bandelow B, Hollander E, ''et al'' |title=WCA recommendations for the long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=8 |issue=8 Suppl 1 |pages=53–61 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=14767398 |url=}}</ref>  These [[rebound symptoms]] may be identical to the symptoms for which the drug was initially taken, or may be part of discontinuation symptoms.<ref name = "Salzman">{{cite journal|last=Salzman|first=Carl|title=The APA task force report on benzodiazepine dependence, toxicity, and abuse|journal=Am J Psychiatry|year=1991|month=February|volume=148|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002239569390021S|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref> In severe cases, the withdrawal reaction may exacerbate or resemble serious psychiatric and medical conditions, such as [[mania]], [[schizophrenia]], and, especially at high doses, [[status epilepticus|seizure]] disorders.<ref name="gabbards"/>  Failure to recognize discontinuation symptoms can lead to false evidence for the need to take benzodiazepines, which in turn leads to withdrawal failure and reinstatement of benzodiazepines, often to higher doses.<ref name="gabbards"/>

==Background==

[[File:Diazepam2mgand5mgtablets.JPG|thumb|[[Diazepam]], 2 mg and 5 mg diazepam tablets, are commonly used in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal.]]
[[File:Chlordiazepoxidetabletsgeneric.JPG|thumb|[[Chlordiazepoxide]], 5 mg capsules, are sometimes used as an alternative to [[diazepam]] for benzodiazepine withdrawal. Like diazepam, it has a long [[elimination half-life]] and long-acting [[active metabolites]].]]

Withdrawal effects caused by sedative hypnotics discontinuation, such as benzodiazepines, [[barbiturates]], or [[ethanol|alcohol]], can cause serious medical complications. They are cited to be more hazardous to withdraw from than [[opiates]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA363 |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=363 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref> Users typically receive little advice and support for discontinuation,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–413 | month= November| year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604 }}</ref> however, Ashton published a comprehensive guide and literature review to help individuals to withdraw safely from them: [http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/ The Ashton Manual] ''Benzodiazepines: How they work and how to withdraw'', summarizing 12 years of clinical experience.

==Signs and symptoms==
Some withdrawal symptoms are identical to the symptoms for which the medication was originally prescribed,<ref name = "Salzman"/> and can be acute or protracted in duration. Onset of symptoms from long [[Biological half-life|half-life]] benzodiazepines might be delayed for up to three weeks, although withdrawal symptoms from short-acting ones often present early, usually within 24–48 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bnf.org/bnf/bnf/57/3139.htm |title = Hypnotics and anxiolytics |accessdate = 13 September 2007 |author = CSM |year = 2007 |publisher = British National Formulary }}</ref> There may be no fundamental differences in symptoms from either high or low dose discontinuation, but symptoms tend to be more severe from higher doses.<ref name = murphy>{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=SM|coauthors=Tyrer P.|title=A double-blind comparison of the effects of gradual withdrawal of lorazepam, diazepam and bromazepam in benzodiazepine dependence|journal=Br J Psychiatry|year=1991|month=April|volume=158|issue=4|pages=Br J Psychiatry. 1991 Apr;158:511–6|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1675901|doi=10.1192/bjp.158.4.511}}</ref>

Daytime reemergence and [[rebound effect|rebound]] withdrawal symptoms, sometimes called interdose withdrawal, may occur once dependence has set in. Reemergence is the return of symptoms for which the drug was initially prescribed, in contrast, rebound symptoms are a return of the symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was initially taken for, but at a more intense level than before. Withdrawal symptoms, on the other hand, may appear for the first time during dose reduction, and include insomnia, anxiety, distress, weight loss, panic, depression, derealization, and paranoia, and are more commonly associated with short-acting benzodiazepines discontinuation, like triazolam and lorazepam.<ref name="gabbards"/><ref>{{cite journal| journal =Pharmacopsychiatry | year =1989 | month =May | volume =22| issue =3| pages =115–119| title =Can a rapidly-eliminated hypnotic cause daytime anxiety? | author =Adam K | coauthors =Oswald I| pmid =2748714| doi =10.1055/s-2007-1014592}}</ref>  Daytime symptoms can occur after a few days to a few weeks of administration of nightly benzodiazepine use<ref>{{cite journal| doi =10.1038/clpt.1982.27| journal =Clin Pharmacol Ther| year =1982| month =February| volume =31| issue =2| pages =175–179| title =Lorazepam-efficacy, side effects, and rebound phenomena| author =Scharf MB| coauthors =Kales A, Bixler EO, Jacoby JA, Schweitzer PK| pmid =6120058}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| doi =10.1038/clpt.1983.203| journal =Clin Pharmacol Ther | year =1983| month =October| volume =34| issue =4| pages =496–500| title =Effects of lorazepam and its withdrawal on sleep, performance, and subjective state| author =Walsh JK| coauthors =Schweitzer PK, Parwatikar S| pmid =6617072}}</ref>  or z-drugs such as zopiclone;<ref>{{ cite journal |pmid=2230061 |url= |format=PDF |year=1990 |month=Jul |author=Fontaine, R; Beaudry, P; Le, Morvan, P; Beauclair, L; Chouinard, G |title=Zopiclone and triazolam in insomnia associated with generalized anxiety disorder: a placebo-controlled evaluation of efficacy and daytime anxiety |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=173–183 |issn=0268-1315 |journal=International clinical psychopharmacology |doi=10.1097/00004850-199007000-00002 }}</ref> withdrawal-related insomnia rebounds worse than baseline<ref>{{cite journal| journal =Pharmacology | year =1986| volume =32| issue =3| pages =121–130| title =Lorazepam: effects on sleep and withdrawal phenomena| author =Kales A| coauthors =Bixler EO, Soldatos CR, Jacoby JA, Kales JD| pmid =3960963| doi =10.1159/000138160}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal =Int Clin Psychopharmacol | year =1999 | month =March | volume =14| issue =2| pages =81–9| title =The use of lorazepam TID for chronic insomnia| author =Bonnet MH| coauthors =Arand DL| pmid =10220122| doi =10.1097/00004850-199903000-00004}}</ref> even when benzodiazepines are used intermittently.<ref>{{cite journal| doi =10.1038/clpt.1991.55| journal =Clin Pharmacol Ther | year =1991 | month =April | volume =49| issue =4| pages =468–476| title =Rebound insomnia after only brief and intermittent use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines| author =Kales A| coauthors =Manfredi RL, Vgontzas AN, Bixler EO, Vela-Bueno A, Fee EC| pmid =2015735 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis and differential diagnosis==
In severe cases, the withdrawal reaction or protracted withdrawal may exacerbate or resemble serious psychiatric and medical conditions, such as [[mania]], [[schizophrenia]], [[agitated depression]], [[panic disorder]] [[generalised anxiety disorder]], and [[complex partial seizures]] and, especially at high doses, [[status epilepticus|seizure]] disorders.<ref name="gabbards"/> Failure to recognize discontinuation symptoms can lead to false evidence for the need to take benzodiazepines, which in turn leads to withdrawal failure and reinstatement of benzodiazepines, often to higher doses. Pre-existing disorder or other causes typically do not improve, where as symptoms of protracted withdrawal gradually improve over the ensuing months.<ref name="gabbards"/> For this reason at least six months should have elapsed after benzodiazepines cessation before re-evaluating the symptoms and updating a diagnosis.

Symptoms may lack a psychological cause and can fluctuate in intensity with periods of good and bad days until eventual recovery.<ref name="pmid6136575">{{cite journal |author=Smith DE, Wesson DR |title=Benzodiazepine dependency syndromes |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=15 |issue=1–2 |pages=85–95 |year=1983 |pmid=6136575 |doi=10.1080/02791072.1983.10472127}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Landry MJ, Smith DE, McDuff DR, Baughman OL |title=Benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal: identification and medical management |journal=J Am Board Fam Pract |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=167–175 |year=1992 |pmid=1575069 |url=}}</ref>

==Management==

Psychological interventions may provide a small but significant additional benefit over gradual dose reduction alone at post-cessation and at follow-up.<ref name ="parrjm"/>  The psychological interventions studied were relaxation training, cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia, and self-monitoring of consumption and symptoms, goal-setting, management of withdrawal and coping with anxiety.<ref name ="parrjm"/>

With sufficient motivation and the proper approach, almost anyone can successfully withdraw from benzodiazepines. However, a prolonged and severe syndrome can lead to collapsed marriages, business failures, bankruptcy, committal to a hospital, and the most serious adverse effect, suicide.<ref name=pdatheagtcau>{{Cite book | last1 = Colvin | first1 = Rod | title = Overcoming Prescription Drug Addiction: A Guide to Coping and Understanding |url=http://books.google.com/?id=lalhQgAACAAJ |edition=3 | date = 26 August 2008 | publisher = Addicus Books | location = United States of America | isbn  = 978-1-886039-88-9 | pages = 74–76 | quote = I have treated ten thousand patients for alcohol and drug problems and have detoxed approximately 1,500 patients for benzodiazepines – the detox for the benzodiazepines is one of the hardest detoxes we do.

:A study into the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms persisting after withdrawal was carried out by Lader and Morton. Study subjects had been benzodiazepine-free for between one month and five years, but all reported persisting withdrawal effects to varying degrees. Persistent symptoms included clouded thinking, tiredness, muscular symptoms such as neck tension, [[depersonalisation]], [[cramps]] and [[shaking]] and the characteristic [[perceptual]] symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, namely, pins and needles feeling, burning skin, pain and subjective sensations of bodily distortion. Therapy with 0.2–2&nbsp;mg of flumazenil [[intravenously]] was found to decrease these symptoms in a [[placebo]]-controlled study. This is of interest as benzodiazepine receptor antagonists are neutral and have no clinical effects. The author of the study suggested the most likely explanation is past benzodiazepine use and subsequent tolerance had locked the conformation of the GABA-BZD receptor complex into an [[inverse agonist]] conformation, and the [[antagonist]] flumazenil resets benzodiazepine receptors to their original sensitivity. Flumazenil was found in this study to be a successful treatment for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, but further research is required.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Professor Malcolm Lader| year= 1992| url= http://www.bcnc.org.uk/flumazenil.html| title= A pilot study of the effects of flumazenil on symptoms persisting after benzodiazepine withdrawal| journal= Journal of Psychopharmacology}}</ref> A study by Professor Borg in [[Sweden]] produced similar results in patients suffering from protracted withdrawal.<ref name="pmid9201803" /><ref name="pmid9201803">{{cite journal |author=Saxon L, Hjemdahl P, Hiltunen AJ, Borg S |title=Effects of flumazenil in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal—a double-blind pilot study |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=131 |issue=2 |pages=153–160 |year=1997 |month=May |pmid=9201803 |doi= 10.1007/s002130050278|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/2vpf562teffglej5/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> In 2007, [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] the makers of flumazenil, ackowleged the existence of protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, but did not recommended [[flumazenil]] to treat the condition.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rocheusa.com/products/romazicon/pi.pdf |title= Romazicon |author= Roche USA |year= 2007 |month= October |format= PDF |publisher= Roche Pharmaceuticals USA}}</ref>
*[[Fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics have been noted by Ashton and confirmed elsewhere as increasing the incidence of a serious CNS toxicity from 1 to 4% in the general population, for benzodiazepine-dependent polulation or in those undergoing withdrawal from them. This is probably the result of their [[GABA]] antagonistic effects as they have been found to competitely displace benzodizepines from benzodiazepine receptor sites. This antagonism can precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms, that can persist for weeks or months before subsiding.  The symptoms include depression, [[anxiety]], [[psychosis]], [[paranoia]], severe [[insomnia]], [[parathesia]], [[tinnitus]], hypersensitivity to light and sound, [[tremor]]s, [[status epilepticus]], suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt.

==Prevention==
According to the [[British National Formulary]], it is better to withdraw too slowly rather than too quickly from benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bnf.org/bnf/bnf/55/3139.htm|title= Hypnotics and anxiolytics|accessdate= 5 September 2008|author= British National Formulary|authorlink= British National Formulary|coauthors= Committee on Safety of Medicines|publisher= BNF.org}}</ref> The rate of dosage reduction is best carried out so as to minimize the symptoms' intensity and severity. Anecdotally, a slow rate of reduction may reduce the risk of developing a severe protracted syndrome.
Long half-life benzodiazepines like [[diazepam]] or [[chlordiazepoxide]] are preferred to minimize [[rebound effects]], and are available in low potency dose forms. Some people may not fully stabilize between dose reductions, even when the rate of reduction is slowed. Such people sometimes simply need to persist as they may not feel better until they have been fully withdrawn from them for a period of time.<ref name="pmid2864096">{{cite journal |author=Higgitt AC, Lader MH, Fonagy P |title=Clinical management of benzodiazepine dependence |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=291 |issue=6497 |pages=688–690 |year=1985 |month=September |pmid=2864096 |pmc=1416639 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.291.6497.688}}</ref>

When symptoms increase periodically during protracted withdrawal, physiological changes may be present, including [[dilated pupils]] as well as an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.<ref name="gabbards">{{Cite book | last1 = Gabbard | first1 = Glen O. | title = Gabbard's Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders, Fourth Edition (Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders) | date = 15 May 2007 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | url=http://books.google.com/?id=-T2aEqfwLW4C&pg=PA209 | isbn  = 1-58562-216-8 | pages = 209–211 }}</ref>  The change in symptoms has been proposed to be due to changes in receptor sensitivity for GABA during the process of tolerance reversal.<ref name="ashman"/> A [[meta-analysis]] found cognitive impairments due to benzodiazepine use show improvements after six months of withdrawal, but the remaining cognitive impairments may be permanent or may require more than six months to reverse.<ref>{{cite journal| journal =Arch Clin Neuropsychol | year =2004| month =April| volume =19| issue =3| pages =437–454| title =Persistence of cognitive effects after withdrawal from long-term benzodiazepine use: a meta-analysis| author =Barker MJ| coauthors =Greenwood KM, Jackson M, Crowe SF| pmid =15033227| doi =10.1016/S0887-6177(03)00096-9}}</ref>
Protracted symptoms continue to fade over a period of many months or several years. There is no known cure for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome except time.<ref name=pwsfb/>

==Epidemiology==

The severity and length of the withdrawal syndrome is likely determined by various factors, including rate of tapering, length of use and dosage size, and possible genetic factors.<ref name="ashman" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hood HM, Metten P, Crabbe JC, Buck KJ |title=Fine mapping of a sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal locus on mouse chromosome 11 |journal=[[Genes, Brain and Behavior]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16436183 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-183X.2005.00122.x }}</ref> Those who have a prior history of withdrawing from benzodiazepines may have a [[sensitization|sensitized]] or [[kindling|kindled]] central nervous system leading to worsening cognition and symptomatology, and making each subsequent withdrawal period worse.<ref name="Dunworth SJ, Mead AN, Stephens DN 2000 1501–1508"/><ref name="Rickels K, Schweizer E, Csanalosi I, Case WG, Chung H 1988 444–450"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="pmid11224351" />

==Special populations==

===Pediatrics===
A neonatal withdrawal syndrome, sometimes severe, can occur when the mother had taken benzodiazepines, especially during the [[third trimester]].  Symptoms include [[hypotonia]], [[apnoeic]] spells, [[cyanosis]], and impaired [[metabolic]] responses to cold stress and [[seizure]]s. The neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been reported to persist from hours to months after birth.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McElhatton PR. | year = 1994 | month = Nov–Dec | title = The effects of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and lactation | journal = Reprod Toxicol. | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–475 | pmid = 7881198 | doi = 10.1016/0890-6238(94)90029-9}}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
Discontinuing benzodiazepines or antidepressants abruptly due to concerns of [[teratogenic]] effects of the medications has a high risk of causing serious complications, so is not recommended. For example, abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepines or antidepressants has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms, including [[suicidal ideation]] and a severe [[rebound effect]] of the return of the underlying [[mental health disorder|disorder]] if present. This can lead to hospitalisation and potentially, suicide. One study reported one-third of mothers who suddenly discontinued or very rapidly tapered their medications became acutely suicidal due to 'unbearable symptoms'. One woman had a [[medical abortion]], as she felt she could no longer cope, and another woman used alcohol in a bid to combat the withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines. [[Spontaneous abortion]]s may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines. The study reported physicians generally are not aware of the severe consequences of abrupt [[withdrawal]] of [[psychotropic]] medications such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Einarson A, Selby P, Koren G |title=Abrupt discontinuation of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy: fear of teratogenic risk and impact of counselling |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=44–8 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11212593 |pmc=1408034 |url=http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/jpn/vol-26/issue-1/pdf/pg44.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

===The elderly===
A study of the elderly who were benzodiazepine dependent found withdrawal could be carried out with few complications and could lead to improvements in sleep and cognitive abilities. At 52 weeks after successful withdrawal, a 22% improvement in cognitive status was found, as well as improved social functioning. Those who remained on benzodiazepines experienced a 5% decline in cognitive abilities, which seemed to be faster than that seen in normal aging, suggesting the longer the intake of benzodiazepines, the worse the cognitive effects become. Some worsening of symptoms were seen in the first few months of benzodiazepine abstinence, but at a 24-week followup, elderly subjects were clearly improved compared to those who remained on benzodiazepines. Improvements in sleep were seen at the 24- and 52-week followups. The authors concluded benzodiazepines were not effective in the long term for sleep problems except in suppressing withdrawal-related [[rebound insomnia]]. Improvements were seen between 24 and 52 weeks after withdrawal in many factors, including improved sleep and several cognitive and performance abilities. Some cognitive abilities, which are sensitive to benzodiazepines, as well as age, such as [[episodic memory]] did not improve. The authors, however, cited a study in younger patients who at a 3.5-year followup showed no memory impairments and speculated that certain memory functions take longer to recover from chronic benzodiazepine use and further improvements in elderly people's cognitive function may occur beyond 52 weeks after withdrawal. The reason it took 24 weeks for improvements to be seen after cessation of benzodiazepine use was due to the time it takes the brain to adapt to the benzodiazepine-free environment.
At 24 weeks, significant improvements were found, including accuracy of information processing improved, but a decline was seen in those who remained on benzodiazepines. Further improvements were noted at the 52-week followup, indicating ongoing improvements with benzodiazepine abstinence. Younger people on benzodiazepines also experience cognitive deterioration in visual spacial memory, but are not as vulnerable as the elderly to the cognitive effects.
Improved reaction times were noted at 52 weeks in elderly patients free from benzodiazepines. This is an important function in the elderly, especially if they drive a car due to the increased risk of road traffic accidents in benzodiazepine users.
At the 24-week followup, 80% of people had successfully withdrawn from benzodiazepines. Part of the success was attributed to the placebo method used for part of the trial which broke the [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]] on benzodiazepines when the elderly patients realised they had completed their gradual reduction several weeks previously, and had only been taking placebo tablets. This helped reassure them they could sleep without their pills.
The authors also warned of the similarities in pharmacology and mechanism of action of the newer [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[Z drugs]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baillargeon L, Landreville P, Verreault R, Beauchemin JP, Grégoire JP, Morin CM |title=Discontinuation of benzodiazepines among older insomniac adults treated with cognitive-behavioural therapy combined with gradual tapering: a randomized trial |journal=CMAJ |volume=169 |issue=10 |pages=1015–1020 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14609970 |pmc=236226 |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/6558/1/6558.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
The [[elimination half-life]] of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, as well as other long half-life benzodiazepines, is twice as long in the elderly compared to younger individuals. Many doctors do not adjust benzodiazepine dosage according to age in elderly patients.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salzman |first1=Carl  |title=Clinical geriatric psychopharmacology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=RXvpjJ1Un2gC |edition=4th |date=15 May 2004 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-4380-8 |pages=450–453}}</ref>

==Controversy==

Detox facilities may be inappropriate for those who have become tolerant while taking the drug as prescribed, as opposed to recreational use. Such inpatient referrals may be traumatic for non-abusers.<ref name="gabbards"/>  Because a rapid discontinuation may produce prolonged and severe withdrawal symptoms, and may predispose for a protracted syndrome, they are generally not recommended.

'''Case studies'''

After only eight to 9 weeks of alprazolam ([[Xanax]]) taken at a fixed, prescribed dose, the following symptoms have been found to occur during abrupt discontinuation: [[dysphoria]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], low energy, [[confusion]], elevated [[systolic blood pressure]], and severe [[anxiety]].<ref name="Uhlenhuth EH 2006 519–23">{{cite journal |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |year=2006 | month=October |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=519–523 |title=Abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam and cognitive style in patients with panic disorder: early effects on mood, performance, and vital signs |author=Uhlenhuth EH |coauthors=Starcevic V, Qualls C, Antal EJ, Matuzas W, Javaid JI, Barnhill J |pmid=16974197 |doi=10.1097/01.jcp.0000236653.85791.60}}</ref>

One case of incorrect equivalent dose switching is of a man who had been taking doses of [[lorazepam]] and [[alprazolam]] equivalent of 60&nbsp;mg of diazepam. He was then switched from the lorazepam and alprazolam to only 7&nbsp;mg of diazepam per day. Within 36 hours, he developed [[somatic]] symptoms and became convinced that he had an underlying pathology, and impulsively [[attempted suicide]]. His symptoms and suicide attempt were diagnosed as benzodiazepine withdrawal. He then tried withdraw from benzodiazepines, but did so too rapidly with erratic dosage reductions and again attempted suicide which resulted in admittance to a psychiatric unit. The author warned that [[self-harm]] can be a feature of benzodiazepine withdrawal.<ref name=selfharm/>
