'''Persecutory delusions''' are a [[delusion]]al condition in which the affected person believes they are being [[Persecution|persecuted]]. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements:<ref name="FreemanGarety2004">Freeman, D. & Garety, P.A. (2004) Paranoia: The Psychology of Persecutory Delusions. Hove: PsychoIogy Press. Page 13. ISBN 1-84169-522-X</ref>
# The individual thinks that harm is occurring, or is going to occur.
# The individual thinks that the perceived persecutor has the intention to cause harm.

According to the [[DSM-IV-TR]], persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in [[schizophrenia]], where the person believes "he or she is being tormented, followed, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed."<ref>{{cite book

In cases where reporters of [[stalking]] behavior have been judged to be making false reports, a majority of them were judged to be delusional.<ref>"After eight uncertain cases were excluded, the false reporting rate was judged to be 11.5%, with the majority of false victims suffering delusions (70%)." {{cite doi|10.1177/0093854803259235}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1891/1559-4343.10.3.163}}</ref>

If the delusion results in imprisonment or [[involuntary commitment]], the person may feel justified in this belief.

==Treatment==
Persecutory delusions are usually treated with medications for schizophrenia, especially when positive symptoms are present.  Both [[Typical_antipsychotic|first-generation antipsychotics]] and [[Atypical antipsychotic|second-generation antipsychotics]] may be useful.<ref>{{cite book |author=Garety, Philippa A.; Freeman, Daniel B.; Bentall, Richard P. |title=Persecutory delusions: assessment, theory, and treatment |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2008 |pages=313 |isbn=0-19-920631-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] has also been used.
