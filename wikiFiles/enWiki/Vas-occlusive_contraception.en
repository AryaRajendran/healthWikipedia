'''Vas-occlusive contraception''' is an [[Experiment|experimental]] [[male contraceptive]] method that is not yet approved{{by whom|date=July 2012}} for general use. Proposed methods of vas-occlusive contraception attempt to prevent [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] from traveling down the [[vasa deferentia]]. Potential methods include [[wiktionary:clip|clips]], [[wiktionary:plug|plug]]s, [[valve]]s, and other devices. 

The '''intra vas device''' ('''IVD'''), analogous to the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) for women, is meant to be a reversible alternative to a [[vasectomy]].  The device consists of a set of flexible, hollow [[silicone]] plugs, each about a millimetre in diameter and 2.5 cm long.  The IVDs are inserted into the [[vas deferens]] and block the flow of sperm from the [[testes]] to the [[seminal vesicle]]s.  

==Progress==
{{As of|2005}}, human [[clinical trial]]s are being performed to evaluate its effectiveness as a contraceptive.  One version is currently in research and development by [[Shepherd Medical]] in [[Vancouver]].   Another version currently being researched in [[China]] is an [[elastomer]] plug device, using medical-grade [[polyurethane]] (MPU) and [[silicone rubber]] (MSR) injected as a liquid.<ref>[http://www.malecontraceptives.org/methods/mpu.htm malecontraceptives.org]</ref>  

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved human clinical trials for the intra-vas device in 2006.<ref>[http://www.obgynnews.com/article/PIIS0029743707703956/fulltext Full text] [http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0029-7437/PIIS0029743707703956.pdf PDF] {{cite journal | title=Male Contraceptive Methods Are in the Pipeline |author=Robert Finn |journal=Ob.Gyn. News 42:28, May 1, 2007}} </ref>

==Side effects==
The procedure is expected to have similar side effects to vasectomy, such as formation of sperm [[antibody|antibodies]].
