'''Overnutrition''' is a form of [[malnutrition]] in which nutrients are oversupplied relative to the amounts required for normal growth, development, and [[metabolism]]. Overnutrition is a type of malnutrition where there are more nutrients than required for normal growth.

The term can refer to:
* [[obesity]], brought on by ''general'' overeating of foods high in [[calorie|caloric]] content, as well as:
* the oversupply of a ''specific'' nutrient or categories of nutrients, such as mineral or [[vitamin poisoning]], due to excessive intake of dietary supplements or foods high in nutrients (such as [[liver (food)|liver]]), or nutritional imbalances caused by various [[fad diet]]s.

For mineral excess, see:
* [[Iron poisoning]], and
* [[low sodium diet]] (excess sodium).
