A '''macrobiotic diet''' (or '''macrobiotics'''), from "macro" (long) and "bios, biot-" (life),<ref>Cf. classical Greek '''μακροβιότης''' ''makrobiótēs'' "longevity", [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=makrobio%2Fths&la=greek&can=makrobio%2Fths0&prior=makro/bios Liddell & Scott Greek Dicionary]</ref> is a [[diet (nutrition)|dietary regimen]] which involves eating [[Cereal|grains]] as a [[staple food]], supplemented with other foods such as local [[vegetable]]s, and avoiding the use of highly processed or refined foods and most animal products. Macrobiotics also addresses manner of eating, by recommending against overeating, and for [[fletcherize| chewing thoroughly]]. Although macrobiotics writers present it as a means of combating cancer both the [[American Cancer Society]] and [[Cancer Research UK]] recommend against cancer patients taking the diet.

== History ==
The earliest recorded use of the term ''macrobiotics'' is found in the writing of [[Hippocrates]], the father of Western Medicine. In his essay "Airs, Waters, and Places," Hippocrates introduced the word to describe people who were healthy and long-lived. [[Herodotus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], and other classical writers used the term ''macrobiotics'' to describe a lifestyle, including a simple balanced diet, that promoted health and longevity.<ref name="blauer">Blauer, Stephen, in Michio Kushi (1993), [http://books.google.com/books?id=JMquGvp31XEC&printsec=frontcover ''The Macrobiotic Way''], 2nd ed. Avery, p. xi ISBN 1-58333-180-8.</ref>

===Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland===
{{main|Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland}}
Hufeland, a German physician, in his book ''The Art of Prolonging Human Life'' (1797), first used the word "macrobiotics" in the context of food and health. Hufeland was an influential doctor who was active in medical research and became a medical professor at Jena and, later, the first dean of medicine at the University of Berlin. Despite the title of his book, he also considered macrobiotics a science aimed at prolonging and perfecting life. According to Hufeland, macrobiotics is a medical philosophy on a higher level than the curative, preventative, or health levels of medicine. "The medical art must consider every disease as an evil which cannot be too soon expelled; the macrobiotic, on the other hand, shows that many diseases may be the means of prolonging life."

[[Image:Hufeland 1797.jpg|thumb|First edition of ''The Art of Prolonging Human Life", 1797]]
In his book, Hufeland refers to a life force which he claimed is present in everything and most easily detected in "organic beings" (live organisms), where it manifests in its response to external stimuli. This force can be weakened, as well as strengthened, through external influences. He believed that our life force would be depleted through physical exertion and increased with rest. Hufeland proposed that moral and physical health are intertwined and flow from the same source, both marked by an abundance of life force. In his view, illness was to be prevented primarily by pursuing a proper diet and lifestyle. In terms of using the word "macrobiotics" in relation to health, food, and energy or life force, Hufeland could be considered the founder of macrobiotics.{{Or|date=February 2011}}

===Sagen Ishizuka===
In the late nineteenth century Japanese military doctor [[Sagen Ishizuka]], the founding father of [[shokuiku]], had great success in helping people recover from their serious health problems. He carried out many clinical trials and published two large volumes of his works. His theory was that a natural diet, in which foods are eaten in season and attention is paid to the correct balance of potassium and sodium and acid and alkaline, leads to good health.<ref name="brown">{{cite book

== Philosophy ==
Followers of the traditional macrobiotic approach believe that food and food quality powerfully affect health, well-being, and happiness, and that a traditional locally based macrobiotic diet has more beneficial effects than others. The modern macrobiotic approach suggests choosing food that is less processed.

One goal of modern macrobiotics is to become sensitive to the actual effects of foods on health and well-being, rather than to follow dietary rules and regulations. Dietary guidelines, however, help in developing sensitivity and an intuitive sense for what sustains health and well-being.<ref name="Kushi, Michio, with Alex Jack 1994">Kushi and Jack</ref>

Japanese macrobiotics emphasizes locally grown [[whole grain]] [[cereal]]s, [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] ([[legume]]s), [[vegetable]]s, [[seaweed]], [[fermented soy products]] and [[fruit]], combined into meals according to the principle of balance (known as [[yin and yang]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}). Whole grains and whole-grain products such as [[brown rice]] and buckwheat pasta ([[soba]]), a variety of cooked and raw vegetables, beans and bean products, mild natural [[seasoning]]s, [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] and [[seed]]s, mild (non-stimulating) beverages such as [[Bancha tea|bancha twig tea]] and fruit are recommended.<ref name="Kushi, Michio, with Alex Jack 1994"/>

Some Japanese macrobiotic theorists, including [[George Ohsawa]], stress the fact that yin and yang are relative qualities that can only be determined in a comparison. All food is considered to have both properties, with one dominating. Foods with yang qualities are considered compact, dense, heavy, hot, whereas those with yin qualities are considered expansive, light, cold, and diffuse.<ref>Porter, pp. 22–25</ref> However, these terms are relative; "yangness" or "yinness" is only discussed in relation to other foods.<ref>Porter, pp. 44–49</ref>

Brown rice and other whole grains such as barley, millet, oats, quinoa, spelt, rye, and teff are considered by macrobiotics to be the foods in which yin and yang are closest to being in balance. Therefore, lists of macrobiotic foods that determine a food as yin or yang generally compare them to whole grains.<ref>Porter, pp. 71–78</ref>

[[Solanaceae|Nightshade]] vegetables, including [[tomato]]es, [[Capsicum|peppers]], [[potato]]es, [[eggplant]]; also [[spinach]], [[beet]]s and [[avocado]]s are not recommended or used sparingly in macrobiotic cooking, as they are considered extremely yin.<ref>Kushi and Jack, p. 119.</ref> Some macrobiotic practitioners also discourage the use of nightshades because of the alkaloid [[solanine]], thought to affect calcium balance.<ref>Stanchich, Lino. "All About Nightshades". ''New Life Journal: Carolina Edition,'' Apr/May 2003, vol. 4, no. 5, p. 17, 3 pp.</ref> Some proponents of a macrobiotic diet believe that nightshade vegetables can cause [[inflammation]] in the body and [[osteoporosis]].<ref>Porter</ref>

==Japanese popularity and influence==

The macrobiotic way of eating was developed and popularized by the Japanese. During the [[Edo period]] in Japan peasants were not allowed to eat meat and had a diet based on staples of [[rice]] and [[soy bean]]s. According to some macrobiotic advocates, a majority of the world population in the past ate a diet based primarily on grains, vegetables, and other plants. Because the macrobiotic diet was developed in Japan, Japanese foods that are beneficial for health are incorporated by most modern macrobiotic eaters.<ref>[http://web-japan.org/trends/lifestyle/lif060209.html Make Mine Macrobiotic | Lifestyle | Trends in Japan]. Web Japan.

== Chinese macrobiotics ==
According to [[Chee Soo]] in ''The Tao of Long Life,''<ref>{{cite book |author=Soo, Chee |title=The Tao of Long Life |url=http://www.seahorsebooks.co.uk/book-samples/long-life-ch10.php |year=1982 |publisher=Aquarian Press (Thorsons/HarperCollins) |isbn=0-85030-320-6}}</ref> natural dietary therapy, or ch'ang ming, has been developed in China since prehistoric times, along with a range of health arts that have become what we now know as [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|traditional Chinese medicine]], or TCM. Other than this, however, there is no real evidence that ch'ang ming predates the advent of macrobiotics in Japan.

== Macrobiotics vs. vegetarianism ==
A macrobiotic diet includes many of the same foods as [[vegetarian]] diets, but in macrobiotics some types of fish and other animal foods are included according to individual needs. The two dietary styles share enough similarities that a vegetarian and even vegan version of macrobiotics is not uncommon.

==Macrobiotics and cancer==
Macrobiotics has been advocated by some as a preventative and cure for [[cancer]].<ref name="isbn0-89529-486-9">{{cite book |author=Esko, Edward; Kushi, Michio |title=The macrobiotic approach to cancer: towards preventing and controlling cancer with diet and lifestyle |publisher=Avery Pub. Group |location=Wayne, N.J |year=1991 |isbn=0-89529-486-9}}</ref> [[Michio Kushi]]'s book ''The Cancer Prevention Diet'' outlines the fundamental philosophy for the diet and cancer prevention. There is evidence that a diet high in whole grains and vegetables and possibly low in saturated fat, red meat, and preserved meat products can help to ''prevent'' many types of cancer.<ref>International Food Information Council. [http://www.ific.org/publications/qa/cancerqa.cfm "Questions and Answers About Cancer, Diet and Fats"].</ref>

There have been no randomized clinical studies published in the available medical literature to show the macrobiotic diet can be used to prevent or cure cancer. One of the earlier versions of the macrobiotic diet that involved eating only brown rice and water has been linked to severe nutritional deficiencies and even death. However, low-fat, high-fiber diets that consist mainly of plant products are believed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. The American National Institutes of Health's, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has funded a pilot study to determine whether a macrobiotic diet may prevent cancer.<ref name="acsmacro">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/DietandNutrition/macrobiotic-diet |title=Macrobiotic Diet |publisher=American Cancer Society |date=November 2008}}</ref>

[[Medical professional]]s do not consider that there is evidence that a macrobiotic diet is a cure for cancer. The [[American Cancer Society]] strongly urges people with cancer not to use a dietary program as an exclusive or primary means of treatment,<ref name=ACS>American Cancer Society. [http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/MacrobioticDietsZenMacrobiotics.htm "Macrobiotic Diets / Zen Macrobiotics"]</ref> and [[Cancer Research UK]] states "we don't support the use of macrobiotic diets for people with cancer".<ref>{{cite web

== Nutrition ==
Detailed information on the nutrients provided by a large range of foodstuffs is available in the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]].<ref>[http://www.ars.usda.gov/services/docs.htm?docid=8964 USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference].</ref>

The following nutrients should be monitored especially in children, because of their importance in facilitating growth and function: calcium, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, riboflavin, vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 2003 | title = Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets | journal = J Am Dietetic Assn | volume = 103 | issue = 6 | pages =748–765 | pmid = 12778049 | doi = 10.1053/jada.2003.50142 | oclc = 1083209 | quote = Vegetarian diets, like all diets, need to be planned appropriately to be nutritionally adequate. | last1 = American Dietetic | first1 = Association | last2 = Dietitians Of | first2 = Canada}}</ref>

==Criticisms==

===Complications===
One of the earlier versions of the macrobiotic diet that involved eating only brown rice and water has been linked to severe nutritional deficiencies and even death. Strict macrobiotic diets that include no animal products may result in nutritional deficiencies unless they are carefully planned. The danger may be worse for people with cancer, who may have to contend with unwanted weight loss and often have increased nutritional and caloric requirements. Relying on this type of treatment alone and avoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer may have serious health consequences.<ref name="acsmacro" />

===Children===
Children may also be particularly prone to nutritional deficiencies resulting from a macrobiotic diet.<ref name="acsmacro" />

===Pregnancy===
Macrobiotic diets have not been tested in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, and the most extreme versions may not include enough of certain nutrients for normal fetal growth.<ref name="acsmacro"/>

===Malnutrition===
In 1971, the AMA Council on Foods and Nutrition said that followers of the macrobiotic diet, particularly the strictest, stood in "great danger" of malnutrition.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.1971.03190160047009 |year=1971|title=Zen Macrobiotic Diets|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=218|issue=3|page=397}}</ref> On the other hand, in 1987, the AMA stated in their ''Family Medical Guide'': "In general, the macrobiotic diet is a healthful way of eating."<ref>{{cite book |title=American Medical Association Family Medical Guide |year=1987 |editors=Kunz, Jeffrey R. M., and Finkel, Asher J. |page=27 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-394-55582-1}}</ref>

===Tobacco===
[[Michio Kushi]] and [[George Ohsawa]] smoked cigarettes. Kushi states that lung cancer can arise from dairy food in the diet: "In combination with tobacco, dairy food can trap tars and other ingredients of tobacco smoke in the lungs, leading often to lung cancer."<ref>Kushi and Jack, p. 112</ref> This is contrary to medical and scientific understanding of the connection between lung cancer and smoking.<ref>[http://www.who.int/entity/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_prevalence_data_2008.pdf WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2008].
