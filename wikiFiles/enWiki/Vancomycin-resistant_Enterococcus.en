'''Vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus''''', or '''vancomycin-resistant enterococci''' ('''VRE'''), are [[Bacterium|bacterial]] strains of the genus ''[[Enterococcus]]'' that are [[Antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to the [[antibiotic]] [[vancomycin]].

== History and biology of VRE ==

To become vancomycin-resistant, vancomycin-sensitive enterococci typically obtain new DNA in the form of [[plasmids]] or [[transposons]] which encode [[genes]] that confer vancomycin resistance. This acquired vancomycin resistance is distinguished from the lower-level, natural vancomycin resistance of certain enterococcal species including [[Enterococcus gallinarum|''E. gallinarum'']] and ''E. casseliflavus''.<ref name="pmid16323116">{{cite journal |author=Courvalin P |title=Vancomycin resistance in gram-positive cocci |journal=Clin.

High-level vancomycin-resistant [[Enterococcus faecalis|''E. faecalis'']] and [[Enterococcus faecium|''E. faecium'']] clinical isolates were first documented in Europe in the late 1980s.<ref name="pmid2891921">{{cite journal |author=Uttley AH, Collins CH, Naidoo J, George RC |title=Vancomycin-resistant enterococci |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8575-6 |pages=57–8 |year=1988 |pmid=2891921 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid2968517">{{cite journal |author=Leclercq R, Derlot E, Duval J, Courvalin P |title=Plasmid-mediated resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin in ''Enterococcus faecium'' |journal=N.

VRE can be carried by healthy people who have come into contact with the bacteria. The most likely place where such contact can occur is in a hospital (nosocomial infection), although it is thought that a significant percentage of [[industrial agriculture (animals)|intensively farmed chicken]] also carry VRE.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Harwood VJ, Brownell M, Perusek W, Whitlock JE | title=Vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus spp.'' isolated from wastewater and chicken feces in the United States | journal=Appl Environ Microbiol | year=2001 | pages=4930–3 | volume=67 | issue=10 | pmid=11571206 | doi=10.1128/AEM.67.10.4930-4933.2001 | pmc=93253 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Cox LA Jr, Popken DA | title=Quantifying human health risks from virginiamycin used in chickens | journal=Risk Analysis | year=2004 | pages=271–88 | volume=24 | issue=1 | pmid=15028017 | doi=10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00428.x }}</ref>

==Mechanism of acquired vancomycin resistance==
{{expert-subject|Microbiology|date=March 2011}}

Six different types of vancomycin resistance are shown by enterococcus : Van-A, Van-B, Van-C, Van-D, Van-E and Van-F. Of these, only Van-A, Van-B and Van-C have been seen in general clinical practice, so far. The significance is that Van-A VRE is resistant to both vancomycin and [[teicoplanin]], Van-B VRE is resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin, and Van-C is only partly resistant to vancomycin, and sensitive to teicoplanin. In the US, [[linezolid]] is commonly used to treat VRE, as teicoplanin is not available.

The mechanism of resistance to vancomycin found in enterococcus involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, D-alanyl-D-alanine, to which vancomycin binds. The D-alanyl-D-lactate variation results in the loss of one hydrogen-bonding interaction (four, as opposed to five for D-alanyl-D-alanine) being possible between vancomycin and the peptide. This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity.  The D-alanyl-D-serine variation causes a six-fold loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pootoolal J, Neu J, Wright GD|title=Glycopeptide Antibiotic Resistance |journal=Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol | year=2002 | pages=381–408 | volume=42 | pmid=11807177 | doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.42.091601.142813}}</ref>

Some VREs respond to the presence of vancomycin rather than just its effect on the cell wall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=79957591 |title=Researchers Identify the Mechanism that Triggers Resistance to Vancomycin |year=2010}}</ref>

==Prevention and treatment of VRE infection==

[[Cephalosporin]] use is a risk factor for colonization and infection by VRE, and restriction of cephalosporin usage has been associated with decreased VRE infection and transmission in hospitals.<ref name="Chavers-2003">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Chavers | first1 = LS. | last2 = Moser | first2 = SA. | last3 = Benjamin | first3 = WH. | last4 = Banks | first4 = SE. | last5 = Steinhauer | first5 = JR. | last6 = Smith | first6 = AM. | last7 = Johnson | first7 = CN. | last8 = Funkhouser | first8 = E. | last9 = Chavers | first9 = LP. | title = Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: 15 years and counting. | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–71 | month = Mar | year = 2003 | doi =  | PMID = 12623315 }}</ref>
