'''World No Tobacco Day''' (WNTD) is observed around the world every year on May 31. It is meant to encourage a 24-hour period of abstinence from all forms of [[tobacco]] consumption across the globe.  The day is further intended to draw global attention to the widespread prevalence of tobacco use and to negative [[health effects of tobacco|health effects]], which currently lead to 5.4 million deaths worldwide annually.  The member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) created World No Tobacco Day in 1987. In the past twenty years, the day has been met with both enthusiasm and resistance across the globe from governments, public health organizations, smokers, growers, and the tobacco industry.

==WHO and World No Tobacco Day==
World No Tobacco Day is one of many other world health awareness days throughout the year organized by the WHO, including [[World Mental Health Day]], [[World AIDS Day]], and World Blood Donor Day, among others.

===Timeline===
*In 1987, the [[World Health organization]] of the WHO passed Resolution WHA40.38, calling for April 7, 1988 to be "a world no-smoking day".  April 7, 1988 was the 40th anniversary of the WHO. The objective of the day was to urge tobacco users worldwide to abstain from using tobacco products for 24 hours, an action they hoped would provide assistance for those trying to quit.<ref>for Disease Control. 1990. MMWR Weekly (April 6, 1990).  http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001591.htm</ref>
*In 1988, Resolution WHA42.19 was passed by the World Health Assembly, calling for the celebration of World No Tobacco Day, every year on May 31.  Since then, the WHO has supported World No Tobacco Day every year, linking each year to a different tobacco-related theme.
*In 1998, the WHO established the Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI), an attempt to focus international resources and attention on the global health issue of tobacco.  The initiative provides assistance for creating global public health policy, encourages mobilization across societies, and supports the [[World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (FCTC).<ref>World Health Organization. 2010. Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI).http://web.ebscohost.com.libproxy.wustl.edu/ehost/detail?vid=1&hid=108&sid=9f40a449-8b2a-441a-95a2n738915e20dcf@sessionmgr104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=aph&AN=33440955http://www.who.int/tobacco/about/en/index.html</ref>  The WHO FCTC is a global public health treaty adopted in 2003 by countries across the globe as an agreement to implement policies that work towards tobacco cessation.
*In 2008, on the eve of the World No Tobacco Day the WHO called for a worldwide ban on all tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship.  The theme of that year’s day was Tobacco-free youth; therefore, this initiative was especially meant to target advertising efforts aimed at youth.  According to the WHO, the tobacco industry must replace older quitting or dying smokers with younger consumers.  Because of this, marketing strategies are commonly observed in places that will attract youth such as movies, the Internet, billboards, and magazines.  Studies have shown that the more youth are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to smoke.<ref>Chan, Margaret. 2008. WHO calls for banning all tobacco advertising, promotion. Nation’s Health. 38 (6):21.

===Themes===
====Discussion====
Each year, the WHO selects a theme for the day in order to create a more unified global message for WNTD.  This theme then becomes the central component of the WHO’s tobacco-related agenda for the following year.<ref>World Health Organization. 2010. World No Tobacco Day 2010. http://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/2010/announcement/en/index.html</ref>  The WHO oversees the creation and distribution of publicity materials related to the theme, including brochures, fliers, posters, websites, and press releases.<ref>World Health Organization. 2010. World No Tobacco Day, 31 May 2009: Campaign Materials. http://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/2009/en/index.html</ref>  In 2008 for the theme Tobacco-free youth, [http://www.who.int/tobacco/resources/multimedia/en/ Youtube videos] were created as a part of the WNTD awareness campaign, and podcasts were first used in 2009.

In many of its WNTD themes and related publicity-materials, the WHO emphasizes the idea of “truth.”  Theme titles such as “Tobacco kills, don’t be duped” (2000) and “Tobacco: deadly in any form or disguise” (2006) indicate a WHO belief that individuals may be misled or confused about the true nature of tobacco; the rationale for the 2000 and 2008 WNTD themes identify the marketing strategies and “illusions” created by the tobacco industry as a primary source of this confusion.<ref>World Health Organization. 2010. World No Tobacco Day 200. http://www.who.int/tobacco/communications/events/wntd/2000/en/index.html</ref>  The WHO’s WNTD materials present an alternate understanding of the “facts” as seen from a global public health perspective.  WNTD publicity materials provide an “official” interpretation of the most up-to-date tobacco-related research and statistics and provide a common ground from which to formulate anti-tobacco arguments around the world.

===Event coordination===
The WHO serves as a central hub for coordinating WNTD events around the world.   The WHO website provides a place for groups to [http://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/2010/registration_form/en/index.html register their planned WNTD events].  The WHO publishes this information, by country, on its website.  The registry helps foster communication and awareness between groups (locally, nationally, and globally) interested in the public health effects of tobacco, and it also serves as a way for interested individuals to quickly see if there is an event in their area.

===Awards===
Since 1988 the WHO has presented one or more Awards to organizations or individuals who have made exceptional contributions to reducing tobacco consumption.  World No Tobacco Day Awards are given to individuals from six different world regions (Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific), and Director-General Special Awards and Recognition Certificates are given to individuals from any region.<ref>World Health Organization. 2010. World No Tobacco Day 2009 Awards – the winners. http://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/2009/awards/en/index.html</ref>

==Global observance==
[[File:Anti Tobacco Movement Jakarta.jpg|thumb|right|The medical students in [[Jakarta]] demonstrate against tobacco, Sunday, May 30, 2010, a day before World No Tobacco Day. The action was meant to raised public awareness on negative effect of smoking. [[Selamat Datang Monument|Bundaran Hotel Indonesia]], Central Jakarta, [[Indonesia]].]]
Groups around the world—from local clubs to city councils to national governments—are encouraged by the WHO to organize events each year to help communities celebrate World No Tobacco Day in their own way at the local level.  Past events have included letter writing campaigns to government officials and local newspapers, marches, public debates, local and national publicity campaigns, anti-tobacco activist meetings, educational programming, and public art.<ref>For examples, search “celebrations around the world” within each theme’s page of the World Health Organization’s website.  Try World Health Organization. 2010. 31 May 2008, World No Tobacco Day activities. http://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/2008/activities/en/index.html to get started.</ref>

In addition, many governments use WNTD as the start date for implementing new smoking bans and tobacco control efforts.  For example, on May 31, 2008, a section of the Smoke Free Ontario Act came into effect banning tobacco "power walls" and displays at stores, and all hospitals and government offices in Australia will become smoke free on May 31, 2010.<ref>CBC News. 2008. Cigarette display ban begins in Quebec, Ontario. http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/31/cigarette-display.html</ref><ref>Pengelley, Jill and Ben Harvy. 2009. .

The day has also been used as a springboard for discussing the current and future state of a country as it relates to tobacco.  For example, in India, (which, with 120 million smokers, has one of the highest rates of tobacco consumption in the world),<ref>Campaign for Tobacco-free kids. 2010. India: Overview. http://tobaccofreecenter.org/resources_country/india</ref> a special section of the Indian journal ''Current Science'', together with the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, was published in time for WNTD, 2009.  This section examined tobacco use and control in India in an attempt to spread awareness and build support for stricter tobacco control.<ref>Current Science. 2009. Contents: Vol. 96 No. 10, 25 May 2006. http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may252009/contents.htm</ref>

==Resistance==
For some, WNTD is nothing more than a “futile attempt to curb smoking” which has little to no visible effect in places like the former [[USSR]], [[India]], and [[China]].<ref>RiaNovosti. 2009. Opinion & Analysis: World No Tobacco Day, Futile Attempt to Curb Smoking. http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090529/155119204.html</ref>  For others, WNTD is seen as a challenge to individual freedom of choice or even a culturally acceptable form of discrimination.  From ignoring WNTD, to participating in protests or acts of defiance, to bookending the day with extra rounds of pro-tobacco advertisements and events, smokers, tobacco growers, and the tobacco industry have found ways to make their opinions of the day  heard.

===Smoker response===
There has been no sustained or widespread effort to organize counter-WNTD events on the part of smokers. There is, however, an active community of smokers’ rights advocates who see the WNTD as unfairly singling them out and challenging their rights.  The WHO maintains a listing of these organizations on its website.

Some small groups have created local pro-smoking events.  For example, the [[Oregon Commentator]], an independent conservative journal of opinion published at the [[University of Oregon]], hosted a “Great American Smoke-in” on campus as a counter to the locally more widespread [[Great American Smokeout]]: “In response to the ever-increasing vilification of smokers on campus, the Oregon Commentator presents the Great American Smoke-in as an opportunity for students to join together and enjoy the pleasures of fine tobacco products.”<ref>2007. OC to host Great American Smoke-in. The Oregon Commentator. November 26. http://www.oregoncommentator.com/category/smoking-ban/page/2/</ref>  Similarly, “Americans for Freedom of Choice” a group in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] organized “World Defiance Day” in response to WNTD and Hawaii’s statewide ban on smoking in restaurants.<ref>Zimmerman, Malia. 2007. Defiance—one puff at a time. Hawaii Reporter. July 6. http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?f3bafc22-9167-4aaa-83d2-b5648c90a890</ref>

===Industry response===
Historically, in America the tobacco industry has funded state initiatives that provide resources to help smokers quit smoking as per the [[Master Settlement Agreement]] regulated by the U.S. government.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598516/</ref> For example, [[Phillip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]] USA operates a [http://www2.pmusa.com/en/quitassist/index.asp “Quit Assist”] website that acts as a guide for those who choose to quit smoking.

World No Tobacco Days have not induced a positive vocal response from the tobacco industry.  For example, a memo made publicly available through [http://www.tobaccoarchives.com/ www.tobaccoarchives.com] was sent out to executives of [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] in preparation for the third annual World No Tobacco Day, which had the theme of “Childhood and Youth Without Tobacco.”  The memo includes a warning about the upcoming day, a document that explains the arguments they anticipate the WHO making, and an explanation of how the company should respond to these claims.  For example, in response to the anticipated argument that their advertisements target children, the company’s response includes arguments that claim their advertisements are targeted towards adults by using adult models, and that advertisements lack the power to influence what people will actually purchase.<ref>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Online Litigation Document Archive. 1990. Infotab. WHO World No-Tobacco Day, 31 May 1990: Growing up without tobacco, The Industry Response. http://rjrtdocs.com./rjrtdocs/image_downloader.wmt?MODE=PDF&SEARCH=0&ROW=1&DOC_RANGE=511992389+-2390&CAMEFROM=1.</ref>  In [[Uganda]], since the World No Tobacco Day is the one day that the media is obligated to publicize tobacco control issues, the British American Tobacco company uses the eve of the day to administer counter-publicity.  In 2001, their strategy included events such as a visit with the President of the International Tobacco Growers Association.<ref>The Environmental Action Network. 2002. Tobacco Industry Tactics in Uganda. http://tean.globalink.org/tobaccotactics.html</ref>

Unlike the tobacco industry, some big pharmaceutical companies do publicly support WNTD.  For example, [[Pfizer]] was a large sponsor for many WNTD events in the [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2008.  At the time, Pfizer was preparing to release its drug Chantix ([[Varenicline]]) into the Middle Eastern market.  The drug was “designed to activate the nicotinic receptor to reduce both the severity of the smoker's craving and the withdrawal symptoms from nicotine.”<ref>UAS Interact. 2007. Today’s News Stories: World No Tobacco Day is “Critically Important” for the Middle East.http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/World_No_Tobacco_Day_is_Critically_Important_for_the_Middle_East/25385.htm.</ref>

===Grower response===
Many tobacco growers feel that anti-tobacco efforts by organizations such as the WHO jeopardize their rights.  For example, the International Tobacco Growers Association (ITGA) argues that poor farmers in Africa may suffer the consequences if WHO anti-tobacco movements succeed.  They also argue that these efforts may gang up on manufacturers of tobacco and be an attack on the industry, therefore hurting the growers.<ref>Yach, Derek and Douglas Bettcher. 2000.
