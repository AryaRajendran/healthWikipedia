The '''medical genetics of Jews''' is the study, screening and treatment of [[genetic disorder]]s that are more common in particular [[Jewish]] populations than in the population as a whole.<ref name=Rosner/> The genetics of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have been particularly well-studied, resulting in the discovery of many genetic disorders that are associated with this [[ethnic group]]. In contrast, the medical genetics of [[Sephardic Jews]] and [[Oriental Jews]] are more complicated, since they are more genetically diverse and there are consequently no genetic disorders that are more common in these groups as a whole; instead they tend to have the genetic diseases that are common in their various countries of origin.<ref name=Rosner/><ref name=Bloch>{{Cite news |author=Talia Bloch |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1109222.html |title=Sephardi Jews lack screening programs for their genetic diseases |work=Haaretz |date=August 21, 2009}}</ref> Several organizations, such as [[Dor Yeshorim]],<ref name=Kolata>{{Cite news |author=Gina Kolata |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/07/health/nightmare-or-the-dream-of-a-new-era-in-genetics.html |title=Nightmare or the Dream Of a New Era in Genetics? |work=New York Times |date=December 7, 1993}}</ref> offer [[genetic screening|screening]] for Ashkenazi genetic diseases,  and these screening programs have had a significant impact, in particular by reducing the number of cases of [[Tay–Sachs disease]].<ref name=Ostrer>{{cite journal |author=Ostrer H |title=A genetic profile of contemporary Jewish populations |journal=Nat.

==Genetics of Jewish populations==
Different ethnic groups tend to suffer from different rates of hereditary diseases, with some being more common, and some less common. Hereditary diseases, particularly [[hemophilia]] were recognized early in [[Jewish history]], even being described in the [[Talmud]].<ref name=Levin/> However, the scientific study of hereditary disease in Jewish populations was initially hindered by the shadow of the racist and unscientific ideas of [[eugenics]] and "racial hygiene", which tried to describe various ethnic groups as inferior.<ref name="Abel 2001 7">{{harvnb|Abel|2001|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bachrach S |title=In the name of public health—Nazi racial hygiene |journal=N.

However, modern studies on the genetics of particular ethnic groups have the tightly-defined purpose of avoiding the birth of children with genetic diseases, or identifying people at particular risk of developing a disease in the future.<ref name="Abel 2001 7"/> Consequently, the Jewish community has been very supportive of modern genetic testing programs, although this unusually high degree of cooperation has raised concerns that it might lead to the false perception that Jews are more susceptible to genetic diseases than other groups of people.<ref name=Levin>{{cite journal |author=Levin M |title=Screening Jews and genes: a consideration of the ethics of genetic screening within the Jewish community: challenges and responses |journal=Genet. Test. |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=207–13 |year=1999 |pmid=10464669 |doi=10.1089/gte.1999.3.207}}</ref> 

However, most populations contain hundreds of [[allele]]s that could potentially cause disease and most people are [[heterozygote]]s for one or two [[recessive]] alleles that would be lethal in a [[homozygote]].<ref name=Modell>{{cite journal |author=Modell B, Darr A |title=Science and society: genetic counselling and customary consanguineous marriage |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=225–9 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11972160 |doi=10.1038/nrg754}}</ref> Although the overall frequency of disease-causing alleles does not vary much between populations, the practice of consanguineous marriage (marriage between second cousins or closer relatives) is common in some Jewish communities, which produces a small increase in the number of children with congenital defects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paul DB, Spencer HG |title="It's Ok, We're Not Cousins by Blood": The Cousin Marriage Controversy in Historical Perspective |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=2627–30 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19108607 |pmc=2605922 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060320 |editor1-last=Keller |editor1-first=Evelyn Fox}}</ref>

According to Daphna Birenbaum Carmeli at the [[University of Haifa]], Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations because:<ref name=Carmeli/>

* Geneticists are intrinsically interested in Jewish populations as a disproportionate percentage of genetics researchers are Jewish. Israel in particular has become an international center of such research.
* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], and at the same time are a large group.
* Jewish populations are overwhelmingly urban, and are concentrated near biomedical centers where such research has been carried out. Such research is especially easy to carry out in Israel, where cradle-to-grave medical insurance is available, together with universal screening for genetic disease.
* Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.
* Participation of Jewish scientists and support from the Jewish community alleviates ethical concerns that sometimes hinder such genetic studies in other ethnic groups.

The result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]]. This has sometimes created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations. Carmeli writes, "Jews are over-represented in human genetic literature, particularly in mutation-related contexts."<ref name=Carmeli>{{cite journal|author=Carmeli, Daphna Birenbaum|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2004|title=Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: Figures, explanation, and potential implications| vol=130A|pmid=15368499|issue=1|pages=76–83 |volume=130a|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20291}}</ref> Another factor that may aid genetic research in this community is that Jewish culture results in excellent medical care, which is coupled to a strong interest in the community's history and demography.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Motulsky AG |title=Jewish diseases and origins |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=99–101 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7719352 |doi=10.1038/ng0295-99}}</ref> 

This set of advantages have led to Ashkenazi Jews in particular being used in many genetic studies, not just in the study of genetic diseases. For example, a series of publications on Ashkenazi centenarians established that their longevity was strongly inherited and associated with lower rates of age-related diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52068.x |author=Atzmon G, Schechter C, Greiner W, Davidson D, Rennert G, Barzilai N |title=Clinical phenotype of families with longevity |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=274–7 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14728640}}</ref> This "healthy aging" phenotype may be due to higher levels of [[telomerase]] in these individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Atzmon G, Cho M, Cawthon RM, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic variation in human telomerase is associated with telomere length in Ashkenazi centenarians |journal=Proc.

==Ashkenazi diseases==
Although there is no reason to think that the Ashkenazi Jewish population has any more or fewer mutations than other ethnic groups, evidence for a significant [[population bottleneck]] suggests that [[allele|deleterious alleles]] may have become more prevalent in the population due to [[genetic drift]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Behar DM, Hammer MF, Garrigan D, ''et al.'' |title=MtDNA evidence for a genetic bottleneck in the early history of the Ashkenazi Jewish population |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=12 | issue=5 |pages=355–364 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14722586 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201156}}</ref> As a result, this group has been particularly intensively-studied, so many mutations have been identified as common in Ashkenazis.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Nicholas Wade |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/04/health/genetics/04GENE.html |title=Diseases Common in Ashkenazim May Be Random |work=New York Times |date=March 4, 2003}}</ref> Of these diseases, many also occur in other Jewish groups and in non-Jewish populations, although the specific mutation which causes the disease may vary between populations. For example, two different mutations in the [[glucocerebrosidase]] gene causes [[Gaucher's disease]] in Ashkenazis, which is their most common genetic disease, but only one of these mutations is found in non-Jewish groups.<ref name=Ostrer/> A few diseases are unique to this group: for example [[familial dysautonomia]] is almost unknown in other populations.<ref name=Ostrer/>

===Tay–Sachs disease===
[[Tay–Sachs disease]], a fatal illness of children that causes mental deterioration prior to death, was historically more prevalent among [[Ashkenazi Jews]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/taysachs/taysachs.htm

===Lipid transport diseases===

[[Gaucher's disease]], in which [[lipid]]s accumulate in inappropriate locations, occurs most frequently among Ashkenazi Jews;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Diaz GA, Gelb BD, Risch N, ''et al.'' |title=Gaucher disease: the origins of the Ashkenazi Jewish N370S and 84GG acid beta-glucosidase mutations |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1821–32 |year=2000 |pmid=10777718 |pmc=1378046|doi=10.1086/302946}}'</ref> the disease is carried by roughly 1 in every 15 Ashkenazi Jews, compared to 1 in 100 of the general American population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaucherdisease.org/prevalence.php |title=National Gaucher Foundation |accessdate=May 30, 2007}}</ref> Gaucher's disease can cause [[brain damage]] and [[seizure]]s, but these effects are not usually present in the form manifested among Ashkenazi Jews; while sufferers still bruise easily, and it can still potentially rupture the [[spleen]], it generally has only a minor impact on life expectancy.

Ashkenazi Jews are also highly affected by other [[lysosomal storage disease]]s, particularly in the form of [[lipid storage disorder]]s. Compared to other ethnic groups, they more frequently act as carriers of [[mucolipidosis]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mssm.edu/jewish_genetics/diseases/mucolipidosis.shtml |title=Mount Sinai – Center for Jewish Genetic Diseases – Department of Human Genetics |accessdate=}}</ref> and [[Niemann–Pick disease]],<ref>[http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org/what/ashkenazi/niemann.asp Ashkenazi Disorders: Mendelian – Niemann–Pick disease: from The Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders]</ref> the latter of which can prove fatal.

The occurrence of several lysosomal storage disorders in the same population suggests that the alleles responsible might have conferred some [[selection|selective advantage]] in the past.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boas FE |title=Linkage to Gaucher mutations in the Ashkenazi population: effect of drift on decay of linkage disequilibrium and evidence for heterozygote selection |journal=Blood Cells Mol. Dis. |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=348–59 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=11042036 |doi=10.1006/bcmd.2000.0314}}</ref> This would be similar to the [[hemoglobin]] allele which is responsible for [[sickle-cell disease]], but solely in people with two copies; those with just one copy of the allele have a [[sickle cell trait]] and gain partial immunity to [[malaria]] as a result. This effect is called [[heterozygote advantage]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harpending H, Cochran G |title=Genetic diversity and genetic burden in humans |journal=Infect. Genet.

It has been proposed that some of these disorders became common in this population due to selection for high levels of [[intelligence]] (see [[Ashkenazi intelligence]]).<ref name="Wade">{{Cite news |author=Nicholas Wade |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/03gene.html |title=Researchers Say Intelligence and Diseases May Be Linked in Ashkenazic Genes |work=The New York Times |date=June 3, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cochran G, Hardy J, Harpending H |title=Natural history of Ashkenazi intelligence |journal=J Biosoc Sci |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=659–93 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16867211 |doi=10.1017/S0021932005027069 |url=http://homepage.mac.com/harpend/.Public/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocsci.pdf}}</ref> However, other research suggests that there is no difference between the frequency of this group of diseases and other genetic diseases in Ashkenazis, which is evidence against any specific selectivity towards lysosomal disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Risch N, Tang H, Katzenstein H, Ekstein J |title=Geographic Distribution of Disease Mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish Population Supports Genetic Drift over Selection |journal=Am.

===Familial dysautonomia===

[[Familial dysautonomia]] (Riley–Day Syndrome), which causes [[vomiting]], speech problems, an inability to [[cry]], and false [[sensory perception]], is almost exclusive to Ashkenazi Jews;<ref>[http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org/what/ashkenazi/familial.asp Ashkenazi Disorders: Mendelian – Familial dysautonomia: from The Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders]</ref> Ashkenazi Jews are almost 100 times more likely to carry the disease than anyone else.<ref>about 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews carry the disease, compared to 1 in 3000 of the general population</ref>

=== Other Ashkenazi diseases and disorders ===

Diseases that are inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern often occur in [[endogamy|endogamous]] populations. Among Ashkenazi Jews, a higher incidence of specific [[genetic disorders]] and [[hereditary]] [[disease]]s have been verified, including:

According to the authors, because of a founder effect, the ancestors of present-day Ashkenazi Jews may have kept the low-frequency G2019S mutation through the different diasporas, whereas Near Eastern daughter populations lost the mutation. The mutation might then have been "reintroduced by recurrent gene flow from Ashkenazi populations to other Jewish, European and North-African populations. The present-day frequency of the mutation in control populations (0.05% in Europeans, 0.5% in North-African Arabs and 1% in Ashkenazi Jews) may support this scenario".<ref>{{Cite journal

In contrast to the Ashkenazi population, [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Oriental Jews]] are much more divergent groups, with ancestors from Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Italy, Libya, the Balkans, Iran, Iraq, India and Yemen, with specific genetic disorders that are found in each regional group, or even in specific sub-populations in these regions.<ref name=Rosner>{{cite journal |author=Rosner G, Rosner S, Orr-Urtreger A |title=Genetic testing in Israel: an overview |journal=Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet |volume=10 |issue= |pages=175–92 |year=2009 |pmid=19453249 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.030308.111406}}</ref>

==Genetic testing in Jewish populations==

One of the first [[genetic testing]] programs to identify [[heterozygote]] carriers of a genetic disorder was a program aimed at eliminating [[Tay–Sachs disease]]. This program began in 1970 and over one million people have now been screened for the mutation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaback MM |title=Population-based genetic screening for reproductive counseling: the Tay–Sachs disease model |journal=Eur. J. Pediatr. |volume=159 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=S192–5 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11216898 |doi=10.1007/PL00014401}}</ref> Identifying carriers and counseling couples on reproductive options have had a large impact on the incidence of the disease, with a decrease from 40–50 per year worldwide to only 4–5 per year.<ref name=Ostrer/> Screening programs now test for several genetic disorders in Jews, although these focus on the Ashkenazi Jews, since other Jewish groups cannot be given a single set of tests for a common set of disorders.<ref name=Bloch/> In the USA, these screening programs have been widely accepted by the Ashkenazi community, and have greatly reduced the frequency of the disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.158.7.777 |author=Kronn D, Jansen V, Ostrer H |title=Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, and Tay–Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population: the first 1000 cases at New York University Medical Center, New York, NY |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=158 |issue=7 |pages=777–81 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9554684}}</ref>

Prenatal testing for several genetic diseases is offered as commercial panels for Ashkenazi couples by both [[CIGNA]] and [[Quest Diagnostics]].  The CIGNA panel is available for testing for parental/preconception screening or following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia, Gaucher disease, mucolipidosis IV, Neimann-Pick disease type A, Tay-Sachs disease and torsion dystonia.  The Quest panel is for parental/preconception testing and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, Neimann-Pick disease types A & B and Tay-Sachs disease.  

The official recommendations of the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] is that Ashkenazi individuals be offered screening for Tay Sachs, Canavan, cystic fibrosis and familial dysautonomia as part of routine obstetrical care.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181bd12f4 |author=ACOG committee on genetics |title=ACOG Committee Opinion No. 442: Preconception and prenatal carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European Jewish descent |journal=Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=114 |issue=4 |pages=950–3 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19888064}}</ref>

In the [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox community]] an organization called [[Dor Yeshorim]] carries out anonymous genetic screening of couples before marriage in order to reduce the risk of children with genetic diseases being born.<ref name=Ekstein>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0065-2660(01)44087-9 |author=Ekstein J, Katzenstein H |title=The Dor Yeshorim story: community-based carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease |journal=Adv. Genet. |volume=44 |issue= |pages=297–310 |year=2001 |pmid=11596991 |series=Advances in Genetics |isbn=978-0-12-017644-1}}</ref> The program educates young people on medical genetics and screens school-aged children for any disease genes. These results are then entered into an anonymous database, identified only by a unique ID number that is given to the person who was tested. If two people are considering getting married, they call the organization and tell them their ID numbers. The organization then tells them if they are genetically compatible.  It is not divulged if one member is a carrier, so as to protect the carrier and his or her family from stigmatization.<ref name=Ekstein/> However, this program as been criticized for exerting social pressure on people to be tested, and for screening for a broad range of recessive genes, including disorders such as Gaucher's disease.<ref name=Kolata/>
