Later he became an observer and gunner in the III. Group. During World War II he flew more than 850 combat missions in [[Junkers Ju 87]] (Stuka) aircraft as a rear gunner.<ref group="Note">For a list of Luftwaffe ground attack aces see ''[[List of German World War II Ground Attack aces]]''</ref> From May 1944 until his last mission on 9 February 1945 he flew with the most decorated German serviceman of the war, [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]]. On this last mission he saved Rudel's life by pulling him from their severely damaged Ju 87 and applying first aid.
