'''Hypothermia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] υποθερμία) is a condition in which core temperature drops below the required temperature for normal [[metabolism]] and body functions which is defined as {{convert|35.0|C|F}}.  [[Body temperature]] is usually maintained near a constant level of {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F}} through biologic [[homeostasis]] or [[thermoregulation]].  If exposed to cold and the internal mechanisms are unable to replenish the heat that is being lost, a drop in core temperature occurs.  As body temperature decreases, characteristic symptoms occur such as [[shivering]] and [[mental confusion]].

Hypothermia is the opposite of [[hyperthermia]] which is present in [[heat exhaustion]] and [[heat stroke]]. One of the lowest documented body temperature from which anyone has recovered was {{convert|13.0|C|F}} in a near-drowning incident involving a 7-year-old girl in Sweden in December 2010.<ref>[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel=4296666 Remarkable recovery of 7-year-old girl], [[Radio Sweden]], 17 January 2011</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms vary depending on the degree of hypothermia and may be divided by the three stages of severity.

===Mild===
Symptoms of mild hypothermia may be vague<ref name=Care99/> with sympathetic nervous system excitation ([[shivering]], [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], [[tachypnea]], and [[vasoconstriction]]).  These are all physiological responses to preserve heat.<ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32">{{cite journal |author=McCullough L, Arora S |title=Diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=2325–32 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15617296 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Cold [[:wikt:diuresis|diuresis]], mental confusion, as well as [[liver disease|hepatic dysfunction]] may also be present.<ref name="Marx 2010 p.1869">Marx 2010 p.1869</ref> [[Hyperglycemia]] may be present, as glucose consumption by cells and insulin secretion both decrease, and tissue sensitivity to insulin may be blunted.<ref name=altus>{{cite journal |author=Altus P, Hickman JW |title=Accidental hypothermia: hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia |journal=West.

Coauthors: James Li, MD; Mark A Silverberg, MD; Wyatt Decker, MD. Updated: Oct 29, 2009</ref>

===Moderate===
Low body temperature results in shivering becoming more violent. Muscle mis-coordination becomes apparent.<ref name=sterba/><ref name=francis>{{cite journal |author=Francis, TJR |title=Immersion hypothermia |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=1998 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5975 |accessdate=2008-06-11 }}</ref><ref name=cheung>{{cite journal |author=Cheung SS, Montie DL, White MD, Behm D |title=Changes in manual dexterity following short-term hand and forearm immersion in 10 degrees C water |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=990–3 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14503680 |doi= |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000009/art00013 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> Movements are slow and labored, accompanied by a stumbling pace and mild confusion, although the person may appear alert. Surface blood vessels contract further as the body focuses its remaining resources on keeping the vital organs warm. The victim becomes pale. Lips, ears, fingers and toes may become blue.

===Severe===
As the temperature decreases further physiological systems falter and [[heart rate]], respiratory rate, and [[blood pressure]] all decreases.  This results in an expected HR in the 30s with a temperature of {{convert|28|C|F}}.<ref name="Marx 2010 p.1869" />

Difficulty in speaking, sluggish thinking, and [[amnesia]] start to appear; inability to use hands and stumbling is also usually present. Cellular metabolic processes shut down. Below {{convert|30|C|F}}, the exposed skin becomes blue and puffy, muscle coordination becomes very poor, walking becomes almost impossible, and the person exhibits incoherent/irrational behavior including terminal burrowing or even a [[stupor]]. [[Pulse]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] rates decrease significantly, but fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can occur. Major organs fail. [[Clinical death]] occurs. Because of decreased cellular activity in stage 3 hypothermia, the body will actually take longer to undergo [[brain death]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

=== Paradoxical undressing ===
Twenty to fifty percent of hypothermia deaths are associated with paradoxical undressing.  This typically occurs during moderate to severe hypothermia, as the person becomes disoriented, confused, and combative.  They may begin discarding their clothing, which, in turn, increases the rate of heat loss.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The word: Paradoxical undressing – being-human |year=2007 |author=New Scientist |journal=New Scientist |url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19426002.600-the-word-paradoxical-undressing.html |accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref><ref name="pmid541627">{{cite journal |author=Wedin B, Vanggaard L, Hirvonen J |title="Paradoxical undressing" in fatal hypothermia |journal=J.

Rescuers who are trained in mountain survival techniques are taught to expect this; however, some may assume incorrectly that urban victims of hypothermia have been subjected to a sexual assault.<ref name=Forensic06>{{cite book |author=Ramsay, David; Michael J.

One explanation for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the [[hypothalamus]], the part of the brain that regulates body temperature. Another explanation is that the muscles contracting peripheral blood vessels become exhausted (known as a loss of vasomotor tone) and relax, leading to a sudden surge of blood (and heat) to the extremities, fooling the person into feeling overheated.<ref name=Forensic06/>

===Terminal burrowing===
An apparent self-protective behaviour known as terminal burrowing, or hide-and-die syndrome,<ref name="carter">{{Cite journal| last1 = Carter| first1 = N| coauthors = N. Carter, M. A. Green, C. M.

==Causes==
[[Image:HypothermiaAge.jpg|thumb|The rate of hypothermia is strongly related to age in the United States.]]
Hypothermia usually occurs from exposure to low temperatures, and is frequently complicated by [[Ethanol|alcohol]]. Any condition that decreases heat production, increases heat loss, or impairs thermoregulation, however, may contribute.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1870 |url= }}</ref>  Thus, hypothermia risk factors include: any condition that affects judgment ([[hypoglycemia]]), the extremes of age, poor clothing, chronic medical conditions (such as [[hypothyroidism]] and [[sepsis]]), substance abuse, homelessness, and living in a cold environment.<ref name=Baum08/><ref>{{cite journal |author=  |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|title=Hypothermia-related deaths—United States, 1999–2002 and 2005 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=282–4 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16543884 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Hypothermia also occurs frequently in major [[Trauma triad of death|trauma]].  Hypothermia is also observed in severe cases of anorexia nervosa.

===Alcohol===
[[Ethanol|Alcohol]] consumption increases the risk of hypothermia via its action as a [[vasodilator]].  It increases blood flow to the body's skin and extremities, making a person ''feel'' warm, while increasing heat loss.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/hypothermia1.shtml |title=Hypothermia |author=Hicks, R |month=January | year=2007 |publisher=BBC Health |accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref>  Between 33 and 73% of cases of hypothermia are complicated by alcohol.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=Chapter 183 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kortelainen ML |title=Drugs and alcohol in hypothermia and hyperthermia related deaths: a retrospective study |journal=J. Forensic Sci. |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1704–12 |year=1987 |month=November |pmid=3430138 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

=== Water ===
Hypothermia continues to be a major limitation to swimming or [[Underwater diving|diving]] in cold water.<ref name=sterba/> The limitation of finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently increases the risk of other injuries.<ref name=sterba/><ref name=cheung/>  Due to the use of gas mixtures containing helium at extreme depths, the use of argon inflation for dry suits, or hot water suits become a necessity for diving deep in colder waters.

Other predisposing factors leading to immersion hypothermia include [[dehydration]], inadequate rewarming with [[Dive_profile#Repetitive_diving|repetitive diving]], starting a dive while wearing cold, wet [[dry suit]] undergarments, [[Perspiration|sweating]] with work, inadequate [[thermal insulation]] (for example, thin dry suit undergarment), and poor [[Physical exercise|physical conditioning]].<ref name=sterba/>

Heat is lost more quickly in water<ref name=sterba>{{cite journal |author=Sterba, JA |title=Field Management of Accidental Hypothermia during Diving |journal=US Naval Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-1-90 |year=1990 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |accessdate=2008-06-11 }}</ref> than on land.  Water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia.  A water temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}} can lead to death in as little as one hour, and water temperatures hovering at freezing can lead to death in as little as 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm|accessdate=2008-02-19|title=Hypothermia safety|publisher=[[United States Power Squadrons]]|date=January 23, 2007}}</ref> A notable example of this occurred during the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']], in which most people who entered the {{convert|-2|C|F}} water died within 15&ndash;30 minutes.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic#CITEREFButler1998</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Heat is primarily generated in muscle tissue, including the [[heart]], and in the [[liver]], while it is lost through the skin (90%) and lungs (10%).<ref name=Care99/>  Heat production may be increased 2 to 4 fold through muscle contractions ( i.e. exercise and shivering ).<ref name=Care99/>  Rates of bodily heat loss are determined, as with any object, by [[convection]], [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]], and [[radiation]].<ref name=Care99/>  The rates of these can be affected by [[body mass index]], body [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratios, clothing and other environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Nuckton T.J.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11043627}}</ref>

Many changes to physiology occur as body temperature decreases.  These occur in the cardiovascular system leading to the [[Osborn wave|Osborn J wave]] and other dysrhythmias, decreased [[central nervous system|CNS]] electrical activity, cold [[:wikt:diuresis|diuresis]], and [[Pulmonary_edema#Non-cardiogenic|non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |pages=1869–1870 |url= }}</ref>

Research has shown that GFR decreases as a result of hypothermia.<ref>{{Cite pmid|7778458}}</ref>  In essence Hypothermia increases preglomerular vasoconstriction thus decreasing both renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).<ref>{{Cite pmid|9715736}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:HypothermiaECG.jpg|thumb|[[Atrial fibrillation]] and [[Osborn wave|Osborn J wave]]s in a person with hypothermia.  Note what could be mistaken for [[ST elevation]].]]
Accurate determination of core temperature often requires a special low temperature thermometer, as most clinical thermometers do not measure accurately below {{convert|34.4|C|F}}.<ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32"/>  A low temperature thermometer can be placed rectally, esophageally, or in the bladder.  The classical ECG finding of hypothermia is the [[Osborn wave|Osborn J wave]]. Also, [[ventricular fibrillation]] frequently occurs below {{convert|28|C|F}} and [[asystole]] below {{convert|20|C|F}}.<ref name=Care99>Hanania, NA, Zimmerman, JL. Accidental hypothermia. Critical Care Clinincs 1999; 15:235.</ref>  The Osborn J may look very similar to those of an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.<ref name="Marx 2010 p.1869"/>  Thrombolysis as a reaction to the presence of Osborn J waves is not indicated, as it would only worsen the underlying [[coagulopathy]] caused by hypothermia.

As a hypothermic person's heart rate may be very slow, prolonged palpation could be required before detecting a pulse.  In 2005, the [[American Heart Association]] recommended at least 30–45 seconds to verify the absence of a pulse before initiating [[CPR]].<ref name=ACLS05>{{cite journal |author=  |author1= ECC Committee, Subcommittees and Task Forces of the American Heart Association|title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=112 |issue=24 Suppl |pages=IV–136 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16314375 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166550 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-136}}</ref>

Most physicians are recommended not to declare a patient dead until their body is warmed to a normal body temperature, since extreme hypothermia can suppress heart and brain function.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17903527|year=2007|last1=Iyer|first1=A|last2=Rajkumar|first2=V|last3=Sadasivan|first3=D|last4=Bruce|first4=J|last5=Gilfillan|first5=I|title=No one is dead until warm and dead|volume=134|issue=4|pages=1042–3|doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.05.028|journal=The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
Appropriate clothing helps to prevent hypothermia.  [[Synthetic fabric|Synthetic]] and [[wool]] fabrics are superior to cotton as they provide better insulation when wet and dry. Some synthetic fabrics, such as polypropylene and polyester, are used in clothing designed to wick perspiration away from the body, such as liner socks and moisture-wicking undergarments.

The [[United States Coast Guard]] promotes using life vests as a method of protection against hypothermia through the 50/50/50 rule: If someone is in {{convert|50|F|C}} water for 50 minutes, he/she has a 50 percent better chance of survival if wearing a life jacket.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}<ref>{{cite web |author=United States Coast Guard |title=Recreational Boating Safety Information |url=http://www.uscg.mil/d13/units/grupangeles/BoatSafe.htm |publisher=United States Coast Guard |accessdate=2008-06-18}}{{Dead link|date=December 2008}}</ref> A [[heat escape lessening position]] can be used to increase survival in cold water.

Aggressiveness of treatment is matched to the degree of hypothermia.  Treatment ranges from noninvasive, passive external warming, to active external rewarming, to active core rewarming.<ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32"/>  In severe cases resuscitation begins with simultaneous removal from the cold environment and concurrent management of the airway, breathing, and circulation.  Rapid rewarming is then commenced.  A minimum of patient movement is recommended as aggressive handling may increase risks of a [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]].<ref name=ACLS05/>

[[Hypoglycemia]] is a frequent complication of hypothermia, and therefore needs to be tested for and treated. Intravenous [[thiamine]] and [[glucose]] is often recommended as many causes of hypothermia are complicated by [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, Sixth edition |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith  |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1181 |url= }}</ref>

===Intravenous fluids===
As most people are moderately dehydrated due to hypothermia induced [[Immersion diuresis|cold diuresis]], intravenous fluids are often helpful (250–500 cc 5% dextrose and normal saline warmed to a temperature of {{convert|40|–|45|C|F}} is often recommended).<ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32"/>

===Rewarming collapse===
Rewarming collapse (or rewarming shock) is a sudden drop in [[blood pressure]] in combination with a low [[cardiac output]] which may occur during active treatment of a severely hypothermic person.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tveita T |title=Rewarming from hypothermia.

==Epidemiology==
In the past hypothermia occurred most frequently in homeless people, but recreational exposure to cold environments is now the main cause of hypothermia.  Between 1995 and 2004 in the United States an average of 1560 cold-related emergency department visits occurred per year and in the years 1999 to 2004 an average of 647 people died per year due to hypothermia.<ref name=Baum08>Baumgartner, Hypothermia and Other Cold-Related Morbidity Emergency Department Visits: United States, 1995–2004 Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, 19, 233 237 (2008)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5615a3.htm#tab |title=Hypothermia-Related Mortality – Montana, 1999–2004 |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== History ==

Hypothermia has played a major role in the success or failure of many military campaigns from [[Hannibal]]'s loss of nearly half his men in the [[Second Punic War]] (218 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]) to the [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|near destruction]] of [[Napoleon]]'s armies in [[Russia]] in 1812. Loss of life to hypothermia in Russian regions continued through the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars, especially in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1868 |url= }}</ref>

Civilian examples of deaths caused by hypothermia are found during the sinkings of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], and more recently of the [[MS Estonia|MS ''Estonia'']].<ref>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=169325&sectioncode=26 Findings: Titanic victims in 'cold shock'] ''Times Higher Education'' 2010-03-23</ref><ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/07/01/020701crbo_books Remember the Lusitania Two new books reëxamine the disaster] ''New Yorker'' Retrieved 2010-03-23</ref><ref name="Soomer et al., 2001">{{cite journal |author=Soomer, H.; Ranta, H.; Penttilä, A. |year=2001 |title=Identification of victims from the M/S Estonia |journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine |volume=114 |issue=4–5 |pages=259–262 |doi=10.1007/s004140000180 |pmid=11355406}}</ref>

==Other animals==
Many animals other than humans often induce hypothermia during [[hibernation]] or [[torpor]].

Water bears ([[Tardigrade]]), microscopic multicellular organisms, can survive [[freezing]] at low temperatures by replacing most of their internal water with the [[sugar]] [[trehalose]], preventing it from crystallization that otherwise damage [[cell membranes]].
