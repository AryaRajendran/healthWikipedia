'''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs''', usually abbreviated to '''NSAIDs'''—but also referred to as '''nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents/analgesics''' ('''NSAIAs''') or '''nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines''' ('''NSAIMs''')—are a class of [[Medication|drug]]s that provide [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]] (fever-reducing) effects, and, in higher doses, [[anti-inflammatory]] effects.

The term "nonsteroidal" distinguishes these drugs from [[steroids]], which, among a broad range of other effects, have a similar [[eicosanoid]]-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. As [[analgesics]], NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non-[[narcotic]].

The most prominent members of this group of drugs are [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], and [[naproxen]], all of which are available [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] in most countries.<ref name="The Physician and Sportsmedicine 2010">{{Cite journal| first=Stuart J. |last=Warden | title=Prophylactic Use of NSAIDs by Athletes: A Risk/Benefit Assessment | journal=The Physician and Sports Medicine | month=April | year=2010 | pages=132–138 | volume= 38 | issue=1 | url=http://www.physsportsmed.com/index.php?article=1770 | doi=10.3810/psm.2010.04.1770 | pmid=20424410}}</ref><ref name="Acetaminophen (APAP) & Liver Damage">[http://www.tylenol.com/page.jhtml?id=tylenol/news/acetaminophen_liver_damage.inc Some Common Medications That Contain Acetaminophen]</ref>

==Medical uses==
NSAIDs are usually indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where [[pain]] and inflammation are present. Research continues into their potential for prevention of [[colorectal cancer]], and treatment of other conditions, such as cancer and [[cardiovascular disease]].

NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions:<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3">{{Cite book|editor=Simone Rossi |title=Australian medicines handbook 2006 |publisher=Australian Medicines Handbook Pty Ltd |location=[[Adelaide]] |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-9757919-2-3 |author=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>

[[Aspirin]], the only NSAID able to irreversibly inhibit [[COX-1]], is also indicated for inhibition of [[platelet]] aggregation. This is useful in the management of arterial [[thrombosis]] and prevention of adverse cardiovascular events. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the action of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]].

In 2001, NSAIDs accounted for 70,000,000 prescriptions and 30 billion [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] doses sold annually in the [[United States]].<ref name="pmid11464731">{{Cite journal|pmid=11464731 |year=2001 |author=Green, Ga |title=Understanding NSAIDs: from aspirin to COX-2 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=50–60 |issn=1098-3597 |journal=Clinical cornerstone |doi=10.1016/S1098-3597(01)90069-9}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The widespread use of NSAIDs has meant that the adverse effects of these drugs have become increasingly prevalent. The two main [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with NSAIDs relate to the [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) and [[renal]] effects of NSAIDs.

These effects are dose-dependent, and in many cases severe enough to pose the risk of ulcer perforation, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and death, limiting the use of NSAID therapy. An estimated 10-20% of NSAID patients experience [[dyspepsia]], and NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events are estimated to result in 103,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths per year in the United States, and represent 43% of drug-related emergency visits. Many of these events are avoidable; a review of physician visits and prescriptions estimated that unnecessary prescriptions for NSAIDs were written in 42% of visits.<ref name="pmid11464731"/>

NSAIDs, like all drugs, may interact with other medications. For example, concurrent use of NSAIDs and [[quinolone]]s may increase the risk of quinolones' adverse [[central nervous system]] effects, including seizure.<ref>

NSAIDs aside from (low-dose) aspirin are associated with a doubled risk of symptomatic heart failure in patients without a history of cardiac disease.

=== Erectile dysfunction risk ===
A 2005 study linked long term (over 3 months) use of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, with a 1.4 times increased risk of [[erectile dysfunction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shiri et al|title=Effect of Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug Use on the Incidence of Erectile Dysfunction|journal=[[Journal of Urology]]|date=Received 2005-05-21|year=|month=May 2006|volume=175|issue=5|pages=1812–1816|url=http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2805%2901000-1/abstract|accessdate=12 June 2011|doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(05)01000-1|first1=R.|last2=Koskimäki|first2=J.|last3=Häkkinen|first3=J.|last4=Tammela|first4=T.L.J.|last5=Auvinen|first5=A.|last6=Hakama|first6=M.}}</ref><ref name="sciencedaily">{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110302152811.htm |title=Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs linked to increased risk of erectile dysfunction |work=sciencedaily.com|date=2 March 2011 |accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> The report by Kaiser Permanente and published in the [[Journal of Urology]], considered that "regular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is associated with erectile dysfunction beyond what would be expected due to age and other condition".<ref name="usatodayed">{{cite news| url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/story/2011/03/New-study-links-pain-relievers-to-erectile-dysfunction/44363996/1 | work=USA Today | title=New study links pain relievers to erectile dysfunction | author = Mary Brophy Marcus | date = March, 2011 }}</ref> The director of research for Kaiser Permanente added that "There are many proven benefits of non steroidals in preventing heart disease and for other conditions.

===Gastrointestinal===
The main adverse drug reactions ([[adverse drug reactions|ADRs]]) associated with NSAID use relate to direct and indirect irritation of the [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] (GI) tract. NSAIDs cause a dual assault on the GI tract: the acidic molecules directly irritate the [[gastric mucosa]], and inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces the levels of protective [[prostaglandins]]. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the GI tract causes increased gastric acid secretion, diminished bicarbonate secretion, diminished mucus secretion and diminished trophic{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} effects on epithelial mucosa.

Common gastrointestinal ADRs include:<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

* Nausea/Vomiting
* [[Dyspepsia]]
* [[Gastric ulcer]]ation/bleeding.<ref name="pmid7888445">{{Cite journal|pmid=7888445 |year=1995 |month= January|author=Traversa, G; Walker, Am; Ippolito, Fm; Caffari, B; Capurso, L; Dezi, A; Koch, M; Maggini, M; Alegiani, Ss; Raschetti, R |title=Gastroduodenal toxicity of different nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=49–54 |issn=1044-3983 |journal=Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.) |doi=10.1097/00001648-199501000-00010}}</ref>
* [[Diarrhea]]

Clinical NSAID ulcers are related to the systemic effects of NSAID administration. Such damage occurs irrespective of the route of administration of the NSAID (e.g., oral, rectal, or parenteral) and can occur even in patients with [[achlorhydria]].<ref>Textbook of Gastroenterology, Tadataka Yamada, 2008, Ch.40, Peptic Ulcer Disease, page 941</ref>

Ulceration risk increases with therapy duration, and with higher doses. To minimise GI ADRs, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time—a practice that studies show is often not followed. Recent studies show that over 50% of patients that take NSAIDs have sustained some mucosal damage to their small intestine.<ref name="pmid19568687">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p637716362731058/|pmid=19568687 |year=2009 |month= July|author=Higuchi K, Umegaki E, Watanabe T, Yoda Y, Morita E, Murano M, Tokioka S, Arakawa T |title=Present status and strategy of NSAIDs-induced small bowel injury |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=879–888 |issn=1435-5922 |journal=Journal of Gastroenterology |doi=10.1007/s00535-009-0102-2}}</ref> Studies show that risk of ulceration is less with [[nabumetone]] than with ibuprofen alone.<ref name="pmid8239849">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1001/archinte.153.22.2565|pmid=8239849 |year=1993|pages=2565–71|issue=22 |month= November|volume=153|author=Roth SH, Tindall EA, Jain AK, McMahon FG, April PA, Bockow BI, Cohen SB, Fleischmann RM|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |title=A controlled study comparing the effects of nabumetone, ibuprofen, and ibuprofen plus [[misoprostol]] on the upper gastrointestinal tract mucosa}}</ref>

There are also some differences in the propensity of individual agents to cause gastrointestinal ADRs. [[Indomethacin]], [[ketoprofen]] and [[piroxicam]] appear to have the highest prevalence of gastric ADRs, while [[ibuprofen]] (lower doses) and [[diclofenac]] appear to have lower rates.<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

Certain NSAIDs, such as aspirin, have been marketed in [[enteric coating|enteric-coated]] formulations that manufacturers claim reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs. Similarly, some believe that rectal formulations may reduce gastrointestinal ADRs. However, considering the mechanism of such ADRs, and in clinical practice, these formulations have not demonstrated a reduced risk of GI ulceration.<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

Commonly, gastric (but not necessarily intestinal) adverse effects can be reduced through suppressing acid production, by concomitant use of a [[proton pump inhibitor]], e.g. [[omeprazole]], [[esomeprazole]]; or the prostaglandin analogue [[misoprostol]]. Misoprostol is itself associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs (diarrhea). While these techniques may be effective, they are expensive for maintenance therapy.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
NSAIDs should be used with caution in individuals with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (e.g., [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]]) due to their tendency to cause gastric bleeding and form ulceration in the gastric lining. Pain relievers such as [[paracetamol]] (also known as [[acetaminophen]]) or drugs containing [[codeine]] (which slows down bowel activity) are safer medications for pain relief in IBD.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Renal===
NSAIDs are also associated with a relatively high incidence of renal adverse drug reactions ([[adverse drug reactions|ADRs]]). The mechanism of these renal ADRs is due to changes in renal haemodynamics (kidney blood flow), ordinarily mediated by prostaglandins, which are affected by NSAIDs. Prostaglandins normally cause vasodilation of the [[afferent arteriole]]s of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]]. This helps maintain normal glomerular perfusion and [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR), an indicator of [[renal function]]. This is particularly important in renal failure where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin II levels. At these elevated levels, angiotensin II also constricts the afferent arteriole into the glomerulus in addition to the efferent arteriole it normally constricts. Prostaglandins serve to dilate the afferent arteriole; by blocking this prostaglandin-mediated effect, particularly in renal failure, NSAIDs cause unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased renal perfusion pressure.

Common ADRs associated with altered renal function include:<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

*Salt and fluid retention
*[[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure)

These agents may also cause renal impairment, especially in combination with other nephrotoxic agents. Renal failure is especially a risk if the patient is also concomitantly taking an [[ACE inhibitor]] (which removes angiotensin II's vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole) and a [[diuretic]] (which drops plasma volume, and thereby RPF) - the so-called "triple whammy" effect.<ref name="pmid10772593">{{Cite journal|pmid=10772593 |year=2000 |month= February|author=Thomas, Mc |title=Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs&mdash;the triple whammy |volume=172 |issue=4 |pages=184–5 |issn=0025-729X |journal=The Medical journal of Australia}}</ref>

In rarer instances NSAIDs may also cause more severe renal conditions:<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>
* [[Interstitial nephritis]]
* [[Nephrotic syndrome]]
* [[Acute renal failure]]
* [[Acute tubular necrosis]]

NSAIDs in combination with excessive use of [[phenacetin]] and/or [[paracetamol]] ([[acetaminophen]]) may lead to [[analgesic nephropathy]].<ref name="pmid9459649">{{Cite journal|pmid=9459649 |year=1998 |month= February|author=De, Broe, Me; Elseviers, Mm |title=Analgesic nephropathy |volume=338 |issue=7 |pages=446–52 |issn=0028-4793 |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |doi=10.1056/NEJM199802123380707}}</ref>

===Photosensitivity===
[[Photodermatitis|Photosensitivity]] is a commonly overlooked adverse effect of many of the NSAIDs.<ref name="pmid12020173">{{Cite journal|pmid=12020173 |year=2002 |author=Moore, De |title=Drug-induced cutaneous photosensitivity: incidence, mechanism, prevention and management |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=345–72 |issn=0114-5916 |journal=Drug safety: an international journal of medical toxicology and drug experience |doi=10.2165/00002018-200225050-00004}}</ref> The 2-arylpropionic acids are the most likely to produce photosensitivity reactions, but other NSAIDs have also been implicated including [[piroxicam]], [[diclofenac]] and [[benzydamine]].

[[Benoxaprofen]], since withdrawn due to its [[hepatotoxicity]], was the most photoactive NSAID observed. The mechanism of photosensitivity, responsible for the high photoactivity of the 2-arylpropionic acids, is the ready [[decarboxylation]] of the [[carboxylic acid]] [[functional group|moiety]]. The specific absorbance characteristics of the different [[chromophore|chromophoric]] 2-aryl substituents, affects the decarboxylation mechanism. While [[ibuprofen]] has weak absorption, it has been reported as a weak photosensitising agent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===During pregnancy===
NSAIDs are not recommended during pregnancy, particularly during the [[third trimester]]. While NSAIDs as a class are not direct [[teratogen]]s, they may cause premature closure of the fetal [[ductus arteriosus]] and renal ADRs in the fetus. Additionally, they are linked with [[premature birth]]<ref name="pmid15013926">{{Cite journal|pmid=15013926 |year=2004 |month= March|author=Østensen, Me; Skomsvoll, Jf |title=Anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy during pregnancy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=571–80 |issn=1465-6566 |doi=10.1517/14656566.5.3.571 |journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy}}</ref> and [[miscarriage]].<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=21896698 |year=2011 |month=September |author=Hamid Reza Nakhai-Pour MD PhD, Perrine Broy BSc, Odile Sheehy MSc, Anick Bérard PhD |title=Use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.110454 |pmc=3193112 |volume=183 |issue=15 |pages=1713–20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Reza Nakhai-Pour MD PhD,|first=Hamid|title=Use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2011/09/06/cmaj.110454.full.pdf+html|publisher=Canadian Medical Association Journal|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref>  Aspirin, however, is used together with [[heparin]] in pregnant women with [[antiphospholipid antibodies]].<ref name="pmid15485103">{{Cite journal|pmid=15485103 |year=2004 |author=Cervera, R; Balasch, J |title=The management of pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=683–7 |issn=0961-2033 |journal=Lupus |doi=10.1191/0961203304lu1092oa}}</ref> Additionally, [[Indomethacin]] is used in pregnancy to treat [[polyhydramnios]] by reducing fetal urine production via inhibiting fetal renal blood flow.

===Other===
Common adverse drug reactions (ADR), other than listed above, include: raised liver [[enzymes]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]].<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/> Uncommon ADRs include: [[hyperkalaemia]], confusion, [[bronchospasm]], rash.<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/> Rapid and severe swelling of the face and/or body. [[Ibuprofen]] may also rarely cause [[irritable bowel syndrome]] symptoms. NSAIDs are also implicated in some cases of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].

Most NSAIDs penetrate poorly into the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). However, the COX enzymes are expressed constitutively in some areas of the CNS, meaning that even limited penetration may cause adverse effects such as somnolence and dizziness.

In very rare cases, ibuprofen can cause aseptic meningitis.

As with other drugs, [[allergies]] to NSAIDs might exist. While many allergies are specific to one NSAID, up to 1 in 5 people may have unpredictable cross-reactive allergic responses to other NSAIDs as well.<ref>{{cite web|work=Allergy Capital|url=http://www.allergycapital.com.au/Pages/aspirin.html|title=Adverse and allergic reactions to aspirin and NSAIDS|accessdate=23 March 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the [[enzyme]] [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), inhibiting both the [[cyclooxygenase-1]] (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [[isoenzyme]]s. This inhibition is competitively [[Reversible_inhibition#Reversible_inhibitors|reversible]] (albeit at varying degrees of reversibility), as opposed to the mechanism of [[aspirin]], which is irreversible inhibition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Knights|first=Kathleen|title=Defining the COX Inhibitor Selectivity of NSAIDs: Implications for Understanding Toxicity|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/733075_5|publisher=Web MD LLC|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>  COX catalyzes the formation of [[prostaglandin]]s and [[thromboxane]] from [[arachidonic acid]] (itself derived from the cellular [[phospholipid]] bilayer by [[phospholipase A2|phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>]]). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of [[inflammation]]. This [[mechanism of action]] was elucidated by [[John Vane]] (1927–2004), who received a [[Nobel Prize]] for his work (see [[Mechanism of action of aspirin]]).

COX-1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme with a "house-keeping" role in regulating many normal physiological processes. One of these is in the [[stomach]] lining, where prostaglandins serve a protective role, preventing the stomach [[mucosa]] from being eroded by its own acid.  COX-2 was discovered in 1991 by [[Daniel L. Simmons]] at [[Brigham Young University]].  COX-2 is an enzyme facultatively expressed in inflammation, and it is inhibition of COX-2 that produces the desirable effects of NSAIDs.

When nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) lower stomach prostaglandin levels, [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]] of the [[stomach]] or [[duodenum]] internal [[bleeding]] can result.

NSAIDs have been studied in various assays to understand how they affect each of these enzymes.  While the assays reveal differences, unfortunately different assays provide differing ratios.,<ref>[http://www.moffitt.org/moffittapps/ccj/v6ns/article5.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_06_s5/pdf/113_11_06_s5_article.pdf</ref>

The discovery of COX-2 led to research to development of selective COX-2 inhibiting drugs that do not cause gastric problems characteristic of older NSAIDs.

[[Acetaminophen]] is not considered an NSAID because it has little anti-inflammatory activity.  It treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but not much in the rest of the body.<ref name="Hinz_2008" />

However, many aspects of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs remain unexplained, for this reason further COX pathways are hypothesized. The [[COX-3]] pathway was believed to fill some of this gap but recent findings make it appear unlikely that it plays any significant role in humans and alternative explanation models are proposed.<ref name="Hinz_2008">{{Cite pmid|17884974}}</ref>

NSAIDs are also used in the acute pain caused by [[gout]] because they inhibit [[urate]] crystal [[phagocytosis]] besides inhibition of prostaglandin synthase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacology2000.com/Hemo/Inflammation/inflam5.htm |title=Inflammation page 5 |publisher=Pharmacology2000.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>

[[Arachidonic acid]] is the precursor substrate for cyclooxygenase leading to the production of prostaglandins F, D & E.

==Classification==
NSAIDs can be classified based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action. Older NSAIDs were known long before their mechanism of action was elucidated and were for this reason classified by chemical structure or origin. Newer substances are more often classified by mechanism of action.

A related drug, [[Paracetamol]] or "''acetaminophen''" is often considered in the same category as NSAIDS due to its use as a non-narcotic analgesic and fever-reducing agent, but is not classified as a NSAID because it only exerts weak anti-inflammatory effects.

===Main practical differences===
NSAIDs within a group tend to have similar characteristics and tolerability. There is little difference in clinical efficacy among the NSAIDs when used at equivalent doses.<ref name=dean/> Rather, differences among compounds usually relate to dosing regimens (related to the compound's [[elimination half-life]]), route of administration, and tolerability profile.

Regarding adverse effects, selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s have lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but a substantially more increased risk of [[myocardial infarction]] than the increased risk from nonselective inhibitors.<ref name=dean>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=ebm Comparing NSAIDs] - Summaries of key questions from the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP), Oregon Health & Science University. By Laura Dean, National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</ref> Some data also supports that the partially selective [[nabumetone]] is less likely to cause gastrointestinal events.<ref name=dean/> The nonselective [[naproxen]] appears risk-neutral with regard to cardiovascular events.<ref name=dean/>

A consumer report noted that [[ibuprofen]], naproxen, and [[salsalate]] are less expensive than other NSAIDs, and essentially as effective and safe when used appropriately to treat osteoarthritis and pain.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/Nsaids2.pdf Treating Osteoarthritis and Pain: The Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Comparing Effectiveness, Safety, and Price]

==Pharmacokinetics==
Most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are weak acids, with a pKa of 3-5. They are absorbed well from the [[stomach]] and intestinal mucosa. They are highly protein-bound in plasma (typically >95%), usually to [[human serum albumin|albumin]], so that their [[volume of distribution]] typically approximates to plasma volume. Most NSAIDs are metabolised in the [[liver]] by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites that typically are excreted in the [[urine]], though some drugs are partially excreted in [[bile]]. Metabolism may be abnormal in certain disease states, and accumulation may occur even with normal dosage.

Ibuprofen and diclofenac have short half-lives (2–3 hours). Some NSAIDs (typically oxicams) have very long half-lives (e.g. 20–60 hours).

==Chirality==
Most NSAIDs are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecules ([[diclofenac]] is a notable exception). However, the majority are prepared in a [[racemic]] mixture. Typically, only a single [[enantiomer]] is pharmacologically active. For some drugs (typically profens), an [[isomerase]] [[enzyme]] ''in vivo'' converts the inactive enantiomer into the active form, although its activity varies widely in individuals. This phenomenon is likely responsible for the poor correlation between NSAID efficacy and plasma concentration observed in older studies, when specific analysis of the active enantiomer was not performed.

[[Ibuprofen]] and [[ketoprofen]] are now available in single, active enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen), which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. [[Naproxen]] has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.

==Controversies with COX-2 inhibitors==
[[Rofecoxib]] was shown to produce significantly fewer gastrointestinal ADRs compared with naproxen.<ref name="pmid11087881">{{Cite journal|pmid=11087881 |year=2000 |month= November|author=Bombardier, C; Laine, L; Reicin, A; Shapiro, D; Burgos-Vargas, R; Davis, B; Day, R; Ferraz, Mb; Hawkey, Cj; Hochberg, Mc; Kvien, Tk; Schnitzer, Tj; Vigor, Study, Group |title=Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis |volume=343 |issue=21 |pages=1520–8, 2 p following 1528 |issn=0028-4793 |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |doi=10.1056/NEJM200011233432103}}</ref> This study, the VIGOR trial, raised the issue of the cardiovascular safety of the coxibs. A statistically insignificant increase in the incidence of [[myocardial infarction]]s was observed in patients on rofecoxib. Further data, from the APPROVe trial, showed a statistically significant relative risk of cardiovascular events of 1.97 versus placebo<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=JA|coauthors=Sandler, RS, Bresalier, RS, Lanas, A, Morton, DG, Riddell, R, Iverson, ER, Demets, DL|title=Cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib: final analysis of the APPROVe trial|journal=Lancet|date=15 November 2008|volume=372|issue=9651|pages=1756–64|pmid=18922570|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61490-7}}</ref>—which caused a worldwide withdrawal of rofecoxib in October 2004.

==Veterinary use==
Research supports the use of NSAIDs for the control of pain associated with veterinary procedures such as dehorning and castration of calves. The best effect is obtained by combining a short-term local anesthetic such as [[lidocaine]] with an NSAID acting as a longer term analgesic. However, as different species have varying reactions to different medications in the NSAID family, little of the existing research data can be extrapolated to animal species other than those specifically studied, and the relevant government agency in one area sometimes prohibits uses approved in other jurisdictions.

For example, [[ketoprofen]]'s effects have been studied in horses more than in [[ruminants]] but, due to controversy over its use in racehorses, veterinarians who treat livestock in the United States more commonly prescribe [[flunixin meglumine]], which, while labeled for use in such animals, is not indicated for post-operative pain.

In the United States, [[meloxicam]] is approved for use only in canines, whereas (due to concerns about liver damage) it carries warnings against its use in cats<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm118006.pdf|title=NADA 141-213: New Animal Drug Application Approval (for Metacam® (meloxicam) 0.5 mg/mL and 1.5 mg/mL Oral Suspension)|date=15 April 2003|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref><ref name="ProdInsert">Metacam [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/DrugLabels/UCM050394.pdf Client Information Sheet], product description: "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for oral use in dogs only", and in the "What Is Metacam" section in bold-face type: "Do not use in cats.", January 2005.</ref> except for one-time use during surgery.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm118027.pdf Metacam 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection, Supplemental Approval] 28 October 2004.</ref>  In spite of these warnings, meloxicam is frequently prescribed "off-label" for non-canine animals including cats and livestock species.<ref>Off-label use discussed in: Arnold Plotnick MS, DVM, ACVIM, ABVP, [http://www.manhattancats.com/Articles/pain.html Pain Management using Metacam], and Stein, Robert, [http://www.vasg.org/perioperative_pain_management_part_iv.htm Perioperative Pain Managemment] Part IV, Looking Beyond Butorphanol, September 2006.</ref>  In other countries (for example [[European Union|EU]] and [[Canada|CAN]]), by contrast, there is a label claim for use in cats.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
