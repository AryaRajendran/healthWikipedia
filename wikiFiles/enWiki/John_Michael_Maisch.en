'''John Michael Maisch''' (30 January 1831 [[Hanau]], [[Germany]] - September 10, 1893) was a [[United States]] [[pharmacist]], the "father of adequate pharmaceutical legislation."

==Biography==

===Germany===
He was the son of Conrad Maisch, a merchant.<ref name="dab">{{Cite DAB|Maisch, John Michael|author=Charles H. LaWall|year=1933}}</ref> He received his early education in the free schools of Hanau.  When he was 12, his parents apprenticed him to a goldsmith.  This only lasted three days since school officials disapproved and demanded his return to academic studies.<ref name="alumni obit">{{Cite journal|journal=Alumni Report|title=John M. Maisch|volume=30|issue=1|date=October 1893|author=Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, Alumni Association|pages=5–9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xdEAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5}}</ref>  One of his teachers introduced him to the study of [[mineralogy]] and [[microscopy]], and he did practical fieldwork in the Hanau vicinity.  He conceived an ambition for a university education.  He was at first inclined toward [[theology]], but an increasing interest in natural science led him to devote himself to scientific studies.  His devotion to his studies was such that his health became undermined, and he was obliged to give up his close application to study as well as his ambition for a university education.<ref name="aps">{{Cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|title=Obituary Notice of John M. Maisch|author=Charles S. Dolley|volume=33|issue=146|date=Jul.-Dec., 1894|pages=345–352|jstor=982846}}</ref>

He joined the military service of [[Hesse]] and imbibed the [[Revolutions of 1848 in Germany|revolutionary ideas]] circulating among the soldiers at that time.  Feeling the inconsistency of his situation, he left the military for the [[Turnverein|Turners]] and joined them in promulgating revolutionary ideas in the [[Main River]] valley.  This resulted in him being arrested in [[Sinsheim]] and sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment at hard labor.  With the help of friends, he escaped.<ref name="aps"/>

===United States===
He emigrated to the United States in 1849, and initially worked in a factory in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].  His interest in natural science led him to become acquainted with two doctors, Wiss and Vogler, who helped him study pharmacy, and he was employed in a drug store owned by Wiss.<ref name="aps"/>  When that store was sold, he became a clerk in [[Washington, D.C.]], then [[Philadelphia]] (1853), then [[New York City]] and again, in 1856, in Philadelphia, when he also became an instructor at [[Edward Parrish]]'s School of Practical Pharmacy.  In Philadelphia, one of his employers was Robert Shoemaker, a pioneer wholesale druggist and manufacturing pharmacist.<ref name="dab"/> Maisch aided in the inspection of the roots, barks, leaves, chemicals, etc., that came into the store.<ref name="alumni obit"/>
He published his first paper, “On the Adulteration of Drugs and Chemical Preparations,” in the ''American Journal of Pharmacy'' in May 1854.<ref name="dab"/>

In 1861, he returned to New York City to be professor of [[materia medica]] and pharmacy in the [[New York College of Pharmacy]] and work in the laboratory of [[E. R. Squibb|Edward R. Squibb]]. In 1863, at the height of the [[American Civil War]], he organized and was chief [[chemist]] of the [[U. S. Army]] laboratory in Philadelphia at Sixth and Oxford Streets.<ref name="alumni obit"/> This laboratory realized savings of approximately $1,000,000<ref name="aps"/> for the government during the war.

===Philadelphia===
In 1866, after the war had ended, he opened a pharmacy at 1607<ref name="aps"/> Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia, and joined the faculty of the [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy]]. In 1867, he became professor of materia medica and [[botany]] at the College. Maisch sold his pharmacy in 1871, when he also became editor of the ''[[American Journal of Pharmacy]]'', a position he held for 22 years. In 1871, he also received the degrees of [[Master of Pharmacy|Phar.M.]] and [[Doctor of Pharmacy|Phar.D.]] from the [[Maryland College of Pharmacy]].  From 1870 to 1881, he had charge of the chemical laboratory at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. He was very active in the [[American Pharmaceutical Association]], and its permanent secretary from 1865 until his death,<ref name="alumni obit"/> having charge of the editing of its annual volume of proceedings. He was also one of the committee of revision of the “U. S. Pharmacopœia.”

He actively sought legislation regulating pharmacists and pharmacies.  After completing a survey in 1868 which showed almost a complete absence of such legislation, in 1869 he formulated a model law for state legislatures.  By 1900 such laws could be found practically everywhere.<ref name="anb">{{Cite ANB|Maisch, John Michael|author=David L. Cowen}}</ref>

He was elected to membership in the [[American Philosophical Society]] on January 18, 1884.<ref name="aps"/> His entreaties resulted in the founding of the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Association.<ref name="alumni obit"/>

At his funeral, there were representatives from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy; the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Association; Mt. Moriah Lodge, No. 155, F. and A. M.; Covenant Lodge, No. 114, I. O. O. F.; Cleomenes Senate, No. 14, Order of Sparta; Harmony Chapter, No. 52, Royal Arch Masons; Quaker City Lodge, No. 116, A. O. U. W.; and Deutsche Pionier Verein.  Interment was had at Chelton Hills, and the body was cremated.<ref name="alumni obit"/>

In 1859, he married Charlotte Justine Kuhl.  A widow, five sons and two daughters survived him.<ref name="alumni obit"/>

==Publications==
His original investigations in technical pharmacy were numerous, and treated improved processes of analysis, botanical methods, and chemical researches. For the most part, his research was published in the ''American Journal of Pharmacy''. Other publications:

* ''Griffith's Universal Formulary'', editor (3d ed., Philadelphia, 1874)
* ''The National Dispensatory'', with Alfred M. Stillé (4 eds., 1879-'86).  Stillé, a physician, did the medical part, and Maisch wrote the chemical, botanical, pharmaceutical and materia medica part.
* ''Manual Organic Materia Medica'' (3 eds., 1882–1887).
