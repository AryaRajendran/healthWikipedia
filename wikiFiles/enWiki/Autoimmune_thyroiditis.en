'''Autoimmune thyroiditis''', or Chronic Autoimmune thyroiditis, is a disease in which the body interprets the [[thyroid]] glands and its [[hormone]] products T3, T4 and TSH as threats, therefore producing special antibodies that target the thyroid’s cells, thereby destroying it. It presents with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and the presence or absence of goiters.<ref name="ref 1">{{cite journal|last=Dayan|first=Dayan, Colin M|coauthors=Dayan, Colin M., and Gilbert H. Daniels.|title=Chronic Autoimmune Thyroiditis|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|year=1996|volume=335.2|pages=99–107}}</ref>  
Specialists clinically separate autoimmune thyroiditis into two categories. If goiters are present, it is understood as Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis. On the other hand, if the thyroid is atrophic, but does not present goiters, it is denominated Atrophic Thyroiditis.<ref name="ref 1"/>   
If the symptoms of thyroiditis appear in women after birth, it is attributed to such and therefore called Postpartum Thyroiditis.<ref name="ref 1"/>  
The effects of this disease are not permanent but transient.  Symptoms may come and go depending on whether the patient receives treatment, and whether the treatment is effective.<ref name="ref 1"/>

== Antibodies ==
Thyroid auto[[antibodies]] appear mostly with the presence of [[lymphocytes]] in the targeted organ.<ref name="ref 1"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Weetman|first=A. P.|coauthors=A. M. McGregor, JPublications. 48. (1982): 196-200. H. Lazarus & R. Hall|title=Thyroid Antibodies are Produced by Thyroid-  Derived Lymphocytes.|journal=Blackwell Scientific Publications. 48. (1982): 196-200|year=1982|volume=48|pages=196–200}}</ref> There are three types of antibodies: Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), Thyroglobulin Antibodies ( TgAb), and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Antibodies (TRAb).<ref name=ref2>{{cite web|title=Thyroid Antibodies|url=http://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/thyroid-antibodies/tab/test|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> 
These antibodies affect different targets in the thyroid gland.  The three main targets are as follows: Thyroglobulin, a protein specified in housing the thyroid hormones T3, T4 and TSH; the Thyroid Microsomal Antigen also known as Thyroid Peroxidase, an enzyme in charge of regulating how much hormone the gland should produce; and the Thyrotropin receptors.<ref name="ref 1"/>  
“A certain percentage of patients who are healthy may be positive for one or more thyroid antibodies.”   Doctors who attend to such patients will most likely do routine follow-ups on the patient’s health since, even though it is highly unlikely that they will present any thyroid problems, there is still a chance that they will develop some type of dysfunction with time.<ref name=ref2 />

==Causes==
The exact cause for autoimmune thyroiditis is not known for certain, but researchers have found high correlations with aspects such as genetics, high iodine consumption, and age.

=== Genetics ===

“Thyroid autoimmunity is familial.” <ref name="ref 1"/> The disease is said to be inherited as a dominant trait since it has been reported that as many as fifty percent of the first degree relatives of patients with some type of autoimmune thyroiditis present thyroid antibodies in serum.<ref name="ref 1"/> Some studies have even related it to chromosome 21 because of its high correlation with patients with Down’s syndrome and familial Alzheimer’s disease. Still, this theory is doubted, since patients with Turner’s syndrome also present a high prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis (up to fifty percent).<ref name="ref 1"/>

=== High Iodine Consumption ===

Autoimmune thyroiditis has a higher prevalence in societies that have a higher intake of iodine in their diet, such as the United States and Japan. Also, the rate of lymphositic infiltration increased in areas where the iodine intake was once low, but had been given iodine supplementation. “The prevalence of positive serum tests in such areas rises to over forty percent within 0.5 to 5 years.” <ref name="ref 1"/>  When in the presence of excess iodine, the gland is unable to avoid its inhibitory effect on the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones.  This is why when a person has excess iodine in his or her diet or is administered with additional supplementation in areas where sufficient iodine has been noted, it can induce reversible hypothyroidism.<ref name="ref 1"/>

=== Age ===

It has been shown that “the prevalence of positive tests for thyroid antibodies increases with age, with a frequency as high as 33 percent in women 70 years old or older.” <ref name="ref 1"/>   The mean age of prevalence in women is higher than in men by one year, 58 and 59 years old respectively.  Autoimmune thyroiditis can also affect children.  Although it is very rare for children under the age of five, it can occur, and it accounts for around 40 percent of the cases in adolescents with goiters.  In the case of hypothyroidism, patients over the age of 45 have more chances of developing autoimmune thyroiditis.<ref name="ref 1"/>

== Symptoms ==
The symptoms for autoimmune thyroiditis may vary depending on whether it causes hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

=== Hyperthyroidism ===

Hyperthyroidism can cause sweating, rapid heart rate, anxiety, tremors, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, sudden weight loss, and protruding eyes.<ref name=ref2 />

=== Hypothyroidism ===

Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, hair loss, intolerance to cold, and constipation.<ref name=ref2 />

== Tests ==
There are various tests that can be made depending on the symptoms the patient presents.  Doctors may search for TPOAb when the patient has symptoms that suggest hypothyroidism or when said patient will be started on a drug therapy associated with risks of developing hypothyroidism,<ref name=ref2 />  such as treatments with lithium or Interpheron Alfa.<ref name="ref 1"/>  This antibody is related to [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] and [[Grave’s disease]].  
They may look for TgAb whenever a thyroglobulin test is performed to see if the antibody is present and likely to interfere.  It can also be ordered in regular intervals after the patient has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and just like TPOAb, it can be associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.<ref name=ref2 /> 
In the case that the patient presents symptoms for hyperthyroidism, the doctors are more likely to test for TRAb, as well as monitoring the effects of anti- thyroid therapy, also associated with Grave’s disease.<ref name="ref 1"/>

==Types==
It can refer to:
* [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]
* [[Graves' disease]]
* [[Postpartum thyroiditis]]
