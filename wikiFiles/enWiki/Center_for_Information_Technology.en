The Center for Information Technology (CIT) is one of the 27 Institutes and Centers that comprise the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), an agency of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), a cabinet-level department of the Executive Branch of the [[United States Federal Government]]. Originating in 1954 as a central processing facility in the NIH Office of the Director, the Division of Computer Research and Technology was established in 1964, merging in 1998 with the NIH Office of the CIO and the NIH Office of Research Services Telecommunications Branch to form a new organization, the CIT.  

==Mission==

CIT's mission is to provide, coordinate, and manage information technology and to advance computational science. CIT supports NIH and other Federal research and management programs with efficient, cost-effective administrative and high-powered scientific computing. In addition to providing bioinformatics support and scientific tools and resources, CIT provides enterprise technological and computational support for the NIH community; services include networking, telecommunications, application development and hosting services, technical support, computer training, IT acquisition, and IT security.  

CIT’s activities include the following: 
* engages in collaborative research and provides collaborative support to NIH investigators in the area of computational bioscience;
* provides efficient, cost-effective information systems and networking services;
* provides state-of-the-art scientific and administrative computing facilities;
* identifies new computing technologies with innovative applications to biomedical research;
* creates, purchases, and distributes software applications;
* provides NIH staff with computing information, expertise, and training;
* provides data-processing and high-performance computing facilities, integrated telecommunications data networks, and services to the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) and other Federal agencies;
* serves as a data center to HHS and other Federal agencies; and
* develops, administers, and manages NIH systems and provides consulting services to NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs), in support of administrative and business applications.

In January 2008, in an effort to foster improved information and IT efficiencies, integration, and oversight, the [[Chief_information_officer|Office of the Chief Information Officer]] (OCIO) was established in the NIH Office of the Director. The functions of the CIO, formerly part of NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT), were transferred from CIT to the new OCIO. OCIO develops IT-related strategy, services, and policy to ensure that all NIH IT infrastructure is secure, cost-effective, responsive, and benchmarked against industry standards. CIT functions as the operating arm of the CIO, providing IT expertise for OCIO program activities and providing enterprise IT services and research and administrative support to all of NIH.

CIT consists of an Office of the Director and five major programs: Division of Computational Bioscience (DCB), Division of Customer Support (DCS), Division of Computer System Services (DCSS), Division of Enterprise and Custom Applications (DECA), and Division of Network Systems and Telecommunications (DNST).

The CIT Office of the Director (OD) plans, directs, coordinates, and evaluates the Center's programs, policies, and procedures and provides analysis and guidance in the development of systems for the effective use of IT techniques and equipment in support of NIH programs. The OD includes the Executive Office (EO), which provides CIT administrative and business management services in support of CIT programs. The EO provides oversight of CIT’s administrative policies and procedures; provides financial management, including development and oversight of the CIT budget; advises on human resources planning and management; and performs strategic planning, operational planning, and performance measurement.
