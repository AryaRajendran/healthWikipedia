'''Reproductive compensation''' was originally a theory to explain why [[recessive genetic disorders]] may persist in a [[population]]. It was proposed in 1967 as an explanation for the maintenance of [[Rh negative]] blood groups.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Levin, BR| journal=American Journal of Human Genetics| year=1967| title= The effect of reproductive compensation on the long term maintenance of the Rh [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]: The Rh crossroad revisited| pages=288–302 | pmid = 1706281| volume=19| issue=2 }}</ref> Reproductive compensation refers to the tendency of parents, seeking a given family size, to replace offspring that are lost to genetic disorders. It may also refer to the effects of increased maternal or parental investment in caring for disadvantaged offspring, seeking to compensate for genetic disadvantage. It is a theory that suggests that behavioral as well as physiological factors may play a role in the level of recessive genetic disorders in a population.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Ober, C, Hyslop, T and Hauck, WW| journal=American Journal of Human Genetics| year=1999| title= Inbreeding effects on fertility in humans: evidence for reproductive compensation| pages=225–231 | volume=64| doi=10.1086/302198| pmid=9915962| issue=1| pmc=1377721}}</ref>

According to Andrew Overall of the [[University of Edinburgh]], “Reproductive compensation may be particularly significant where economic or social factors mean that families are small compared to the maximum reproductive rate. Within small families, diseased infants may be more likely to be replaced. As a consequence, parents with otherwise reduced fertility have a greater influence on the frequency of recessive alleles in future generations.” <ref>{{cite journal| author=Overall, AD, Ahmad, M, and Nichols, RA| journal=Heredity| year=2002| title= The effect of reproductive compensation on recessive disorders within consanguineous human populations| issue=6| pages=474–479 | pmid = 12180090| volume=88| doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800090 }}</ref>

Ian Hastings has argued that reproductive technologies such as embryo [[sex selection]], [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] with [[in vitro fertilization]], and selective termination of pregnancy may increase the frequency of genetic disorders through reproductive compensation.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Hastings, IM| journal=Genetics Research| year=2001| title= Reproductive compensation and human genetic disease| pages=277–283 | pmid = 11486510| volume=77| issue=3| doi=10.1017/S0016672301004992 }}</ref>

More recently the reproductive compensation hypothesis has been generalized to include, not only recessive genetic disorders, but in a more general sense, the effects of parental compensation when mate selection or breeding take place under constraints. According to [[Patricia Adair Gowaty]], “The reproductive compensation hypothesis says that individuals constrained by ecological or social forces to reproduce with partners they do not prefer compensate for likely offspring viability deficits.” In human societies, such constraints include the manipulation of female mating options, [[rape|forced copulation]], [[arranged marriages]], and the [[prostitution|trading of copulation for access to resources]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Gowaty, PA| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| year=2008| title= Reproductive Compensation| pmid = 18564347| doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01559.x| volume=21| pages=1189–200| issue=5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Gowaty PA, Anderson WW, Bluhm CK, Drickamer LC, Kim YK, Moore AJ| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| year=2007| title= The hypothesis of reproductive compensation and its assumptions about mate preferences and offspring viability| pmid = 17848509| volume=104| pages=15023–15027| doi=10.1073/pnas.0706622104| issue=38| pmc=1986606 }}</ref>

Whereas [[heterozygote advantage]] can explain the persistence of high carrier rates of [[lethal alleles]] in certain regions (e.g. [[sickle-cell disease]] in Central and West Africa), Johan Koeslag and Stephen Schach <ref>{{cite journal| author=Koeslag JH, Schach SR| journal=Annals of Human Genetics| year=1984| title=Tay-Sachs disease and the role of reproductive compensation in the maintenance of ethnic variations in the incidence of autosomal recessive disease| volume=48| pages=275–281| doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1984.tb01025.x| pmid=6465844| issue=Pt 3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Koeslag JH, Schach SR| journal=Annals of Human Genetics| year=1985| title=On the perpetuation of relic genes having an inviable homozygote| volume=49| pages=291–302| doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1985.tb01705.x| pmid=4073837| issue=Pt 4 }}</ref> have suggested that reproductive compensation might explain why different communities have high carrier rates for differing lethal alleles, despite living in similar or sometimes the same environment. Examples are [[Tay–Sachs disease]] amongst Ashkenazi Jews, [[cystic fibrosis]] amongst people of West European origin, and [[phenylketonuria]] among persons from Ireland.
