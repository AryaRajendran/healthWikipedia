Malpuech syndrome is congenital, being apparent at birth. It is characterized by a feature known as facial clefting. Observed and noted in the initial description of the syndrome as a cleft lip and palate,<ref name=malp/> facial clefting is identified by clefts in the bones, muscles and tissues of the [[face]], including the lips and [[palate]]. The forms of cleft lip and palate typically seen with Malpuech syndrome are midline (down the middle of the lip and palate)<ref name=midcl>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/midline_cleft_lip_in_children.htm |title=Midline cleft lip in children |work=Wrongdiagnoysis.com |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref> or bilateral (affecting both sides of the mouth and palate).<ref name=msar/> Facial clefting generally encompasses a wide range of severity, ranging from minor anomalies such as a [[wikt:bifid|bifid]] (split) [[Palatine uvula|uvula]], to a cleft lip and palate, to major developmental and structural defects of the facial bones and soft tissues.<ref name=fcdef>{{cite web |title=FACE - DIAGNOSIS OF CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES - THE 18-23 WEEKS SCAN |url=http://www.centrus.com.br/DiplomaFMF/SeriesFMF/18-23-weeks/chapter-03/face/facefmf.html |work=Centrus.com.br |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> Clefting of the lip and palate occurs during [[embryogenesis]].<ref name=fcwww>{{cite web |title=Definition of facial clefting |url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=18132 |publisher=Medilexicon.com |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name=fcx>{{cite web |title=Rare facial cleft: 14-mth-old Hunan boy Kang Kang born with a 'mask' |url=http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news12345.html |work=Whatsonxiamen.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> Additional facial and [[orthodontics|ortho-dental]] anomalies that have been described with the syndrome include: [[hypertelorism]] (unusually wide-set eyes, sometimes reported as [[telecanthus]]), narrow [[palpebral fissure]]s (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids) and [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (drooping) of the eyelids, frontal bossing (prominent eyebrow ridge) with [[unibrow|synophris]], highly arched eyebrows, wide [[human nose#Anatomy|nasal root]] and a flattened nasal tip, [[zygomatic bone|malar]] [[hypoplasia]] (underdeveloped [[maxilla|upper cheek bone]]), [[micrognathism|micrognathia]] (an undersized [[human mandible|lower jaw]]), and prominent [[incisor]]s. Auditory anomalies include an enlarged [[helix (ear)|ear ridge]], and [[hearing impairment]] associated with congenital [[otitis media]] (or "glue ear", [[inflammation]] of the [[middle ear]]) and [[sensorineural hearing loss]].<ref name=mlist/><ref name=cspec/><ref name=pana/>

Another feature identified with Malpuech syndrome is a [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior_and_posterior|caudal]] appendage.<ref name=omim/><ref name=cocx/> A caudal appendage is a congenital outgrowth stemming from the [[coccyx]] (tailbone). Present in many non-human animal species as a typical [[tail]], this feature when seen in an infant has been described as a "human tail".<ref name=htail>{{cite pmid|21089026}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|18778987}}</ref> This was observed by Guion-Almeida (1995) in three individuals from Brazil. The appendage on [[radiograph|X-rays]] variously appeared as a prominent protrusion of the coccyx.<ref name=cocx/> On a physical examination, the appendage resembles a nodule-like stub of an animal tail.<ref>Finn and Lynch (2006), illustration, p. 243.</ref>

Deficiencies such as mental retardation, [[learning disability]], [[dwarfism|growth retardation]] and [[delayed milestone|developmental delay]] are common. Psychiatric manifestations that have been reported with the syndrome include [[psychosis|psychotic behavior]], [[obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder]], loss of inhibition, [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|hyperactivity]], [[aggression]], fear of physical contact, and compulsive actions like [[echolalia]] (repeating the words spoken by another person). Neuromuscular [[tic]]s have also been noted.<ref name=mlist/><ref name=cspec/>

Urogenital abnormalities, or those affecting the [[excretory system|urinary]] and [[reproductive system]]s, are common with the syndrome. Malpuech et al. (1983) and Kerstjens-Frederikse et al. (2005) reported variously in affected males a [[micropenis]], [[hypospadias]] (a congenital mislocation of the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urinary meatus]]), [[cryptorchidism]] ([[wikt:ectopic|ectopic]] or undescended [[testicle|testes]]), bifid (split) and underdeveloped [[scrotum]], and an obstructive [[posterior urethral valve|urethral valve]].<ref name=mlist/><ref name=malp/> An affected boy was also reported by Reardon et al. (2001) with left [[renal agenesis]], an enlarged and downwardly displaced right [[kidney]], cryptorchidism and a [[shawl scrotum]].<ref name=mjh/> Other malformations that have been noted with the syndrome are [[omphalocele]]<ref name=cocx/> and an [[umbilical hernia]].<ref name=twins>{{cite pmid|10482884}}</ref>

[[File:Patent ductus arteriosus.svg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram of a neonatal heart affected by PDA]]
Congenital abnormalities of the [[human heart|heart]] have also been observed with Malpuech syndrome. From a healthy Japanese couple, Chinen and Naritomi (1995) described the sixth child who had features consistent with the disorder. This two-month-old male infant was also affected by cardiac anomalies including [[patent ductus arteriosus]] (PDA)<ref>{{OMIM|607411|Patent ductus arteriosus}}</ref> and [[ventricular septal defect]].<ref name=jcard/> The opening in the [[ductus arteriosus]] associated with PDA had been [[Ligature (medicine)|surgically repaired]] in the infant at 38 days of age. A number of minor skeletal aberrations were also reported in the infant, including [[wormian bones]] at the [[lambdoid suture]]s.<ref name=jcard/>

==Classification==
Malpuech syndrome has been shown to have physical, or [[phenotype|phenotypical]] similarities with several other genetic disorders. A report by Reardon et al. (2001) of a nine-year-old boy exhibiting facial, caudal and urogenital anomalies consistent with Malpuech syndrome, who also had skeletal malformites indicative of Juberg-Hayward syndrome, suggests that the two disorders may be [[allele|allelic]] (caused by different [[mutation]]s of the same [[gene]]).<ref name=mjh>{{cite pmid|11310992}}</ref>

Along with several other disorders that have similar, or overlapping features and autosomal recessive inheritance, Malpuech syndrome has been considered to belong under the designation "3MC syndrome". Titomanlio et al. (2005) described a three-year-old female known to have [[Michels syndrome]]. In their review of the physical similarities between Michels, Malpuech and Mingarelli-Carnevale syndromes&mdash;particularly the facial appearance including instances of cleft lip and palate, and ptosis, and a similarity of congenital abdominal and urogenital anomalies&mdash;they believed the syndromes may represent a spectrum of genetic disorders rather than three individual disorders. They initially suggested this spectrum could be named 3MC (Michels-Malpuech-Mingarelli-Carnevale) syndrome.<ref name=tito/> This conclusion and the name 3MC syndrome was supported by Leal et al. (2008), who reported a brother and sister with an array of symptoms that overlapped the various syndromes.<ref name=leal>{{cite pmid|18266249}}</ref> Further assertion of 3MC syndrome was by Rooryck et al. (2011) in an elaboration of its cause.<ref name=cm11/>

==Cause and genetics==
[[Image:Autorecessive.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Malpuech facial clefting syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]
Malpuech syndrome, as with the other disorders within the 3MC syndrome consideration, is caused by mutations in the ''COLLEC11'' and ''[[MASP1 (protein)|MASP1]]'' genes. In an investigation by Rooryck et al. (2011), eleven families affected by 3MC syndrome were studied, which resulted in the identification of these two mutations. Both genes encode proteins of the [[Mannan-binding lectin pathway|lectin complement pathway]], which plays a role in the [[complement system]] of [[innate immune system|innate]], or non-specific immunity in humans and other species.<ref name=cm11/>

The ''COLLEC11'', or ''CL-K1'' gene is located on the short arm of [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 2 (human)|2]] (2p25.3) in humans.<ref>{{OMIM|612502|''COLLEC11''}}</ref> The CL-K1 protein is a [[C-type lectin]], and belongs to the [[collectin]] family of these proteins. Other than its role in innate immunity, the protein is thought to be involved in the development of tissues including craniofacial cartilage, the heart and kidney during embryogenesis. This function in facial development was corroborated through study of the [[zebrafish]], where mutations in its version of ''CL-K1'' contributed to craniofacial abnormalities possibly associated with errors in [[neural crest]] cell migration.<ref name=cm11/>
[[File:Chromarms.gif|thumb|left|150px|The short and long arm of a typical human chromosome.]]
The ''MASP1'', or ''Mannan-binding Serine Protease I'' gene is located on the long arm of human [[chromosome 3 (human)|chromosome 3]] at 3q27-q28.<ref>{{OMIM|600521|''MASP1''}}</ref> The protein is a type of connectin called a [[mannan-binding lectin]], which plays a role in innate immunity by binding to [[pathogen]]s such as [[virus]]es including [[HIV]].<ref>{{cite pmid|15488604}}</ref>

As described by Sirmaci et al. (2010), three Turkish individuals from two [[Consanguinity|consanguineous]] families (the children of relatives such as cousins are said to be in a consanguineous family) with various characteristics of 3MC syndrome, including facial dysmorphism and a caudal appendage, were evaluated. Investigation of [[homologous chromosome]]s through [[gene mapping]] revealed an [[Zygosity#Autozygous and allozygous|autozygous region]] (a [[locus (genetics)|location]] on a chromosome where both alleles of a gene originate from a common ancestor) at chromosome 3q27 in both families. In one family, a [[missense mutation]] in ''MASP1'' at this location resulted in the replacement of the [[amino acid]] [[glycine]] by [[arginine]] at position 687 in the [[Messenger RNA|gene sequence]]. The mutation [[wikt:cosegregate|cosegregated]] with the observed phenotype. In individuals from the second family, [[DNA sequencing]] of ''MASP1'' showed a [[nonsense mutation]] that resulted in a deactivation of [[tryptophan]] at position 290 in the gene, that also cosegregated with the phenotype. Both mutations occur in a [[protein isoform|form]] of ''MASP1'' known to process [[IGFBP5]]; loss of this function associated with mutation of ''MASP1'' causes disruptions in the availability of [[insulin-like growth factor]] during craniofacial and musculoskeletal development during the embryonic period. These results indicate that mutations in ''MASP1'' are responsible for an array of features found with malformation disorders including Malpuech syndrome.<ref name=masp10>{{cite pmid|21035106}}</ref>

The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.<ref name=msar/> This means the defective gene(s) responsible for the disorder (''COLLEC11'', ''MASP1'') is located on an autosome (chromosomes 2 and 3 are autosomes), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

==Diagnosis==
It is suggested that the [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic criteria]] for Malpuech syndrome should include cleft lip and/or palate, typical associated facial features, and at least two of the following: urogenital anomalies, caudal appendage, and growth or developmental delay.<ref name=noca>{{cite pmid|16957483}}</ref> 
Due to the relatively high rate of hearing impairment found with the disorder, it too may be considered in the diagnosis. Another congenital disorder, [[Wolf&ndash;Hirschhorn syndrome|Wolf-Hirschhorn]] (Pitt-Rogers-Danks) syndrome, shares Malpuech features in its diagnostic criteria. Because of this lacking differentiation, [[karyotype|karyotyping]] (microscopic analysis of the chromosomes of an individual) can be employed to distinguish the two. Whereas deletions in the short arm of [[chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]] would be revealed with Wolf-Hirschhorn, a karyotype without this aberration present would favor a Malpuech syndrome diagnosis. Also, the karyotype of an individual with Malpuech syndrome alone will be normal.<ref name=cspec/>

==Management==
Many of the congenital malformations found with Malpuech syndrome can be corrected surgically. These include cleft lip and palate, omphalocele, urogenital and craniofacial abnormalities, skeletal deformities such as a caudal appendage or scoliosis, and hernias of the umbillicus. The primary area of concern for these procedures applied to a neonate with congenital disorders including Malpuech syndrome regards the logistics of anesthesia. Methods like [[tracheal intubation]] for management of the airway during [[general anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] can be hampered by the even smaller, or maldeveloped mouth of the infant. For [[regional anaesthesia|regional anesthesia]], methods like [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal blocking]] are more difficult where scoliosis is present. In a 2010 report by Kiernan et al., a four-year-old girl with Malpuech syndrome was being prepared for an unrelated [[tonsillectomy]] and [[adenoidectomy]]. While undergoing intubation, insertion of a [[laryngoscopy|laryngoscope]], needed to identify the airway for the placement of the [[Tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]], was made troublesome by the presence of [[micrognathism|micrognathia]] attributed to the syndrome. After replacement with a laryngoscope of adjusted size, intubation proceeded normally. Successful general anesthesia followed.<ref name=pana/>

A rare follow-up of a male with Malpuech syndrome was presented by Priolo et al. (2007). Born at term from an uneventful pregnancy and delivery, the infant underwent a surgical repair of a cleft lip and palate. No problems were reported with the procedure. A heart abnormality, [[atrial septal defect]], was also apparent but required no intervention. At age three years, mental retardation, [[hyperactivity]] and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] were diagnosed; hearing impairment was diagnosed at age six, managed with the use of [[hearing aid]]s. Over the course of the decade that followed, a number of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] evaluations were performed. At age 14, he exhibited a fear of physical contact; at age 15, he experienced a severe [[psychosis|psychotic]] episode, characterized by agitation and a loss of sociosexual inhibition. This array of symptoms were treated [[pharmacology|pharmocologically]] (with prescription medications). He maintained a low level of mental deficiency by age 17, with moments of compulsive [[echolalia]].<ref name=cspec/>

==Epidemiology and history==
The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of Malpuech syndrome has not been determined.<ref name=pana>{{cite pmid|20470345}}</ref> A 1999 report by Crisponi et al. suggested that only about 12 individuals worldwide were affected by the disorder at that time.<ref name=twins/> The syndrome was first reported by Guilliaume Malpuech and colleagues in 1983, observed in four children of unspecified gender in what was described as a [[wikt:gypsy|gypsy]] family. The children included three siblings and their first cousin; the family was known to be highly [[consanguineous]].<ref name=malp/><ref name=cspec>{{cite pmid|17140870}}</ref>
