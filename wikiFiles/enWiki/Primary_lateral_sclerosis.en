'''Primary lateral sclerosis''' ('''PLS''') is a rare [[neuromuscular disease]] characterized by progressive muscle weakness in the [[voluntary muscles]]. PLS belongs to a group of disorders known as [[motor neuron disease]]s. Motor neuron diseases develop when the [[nerve cell]]s that control voluntary muscle movement degenerate and die, causing weakness in the muscles they control. 

PLS only affects [[upper motor neuron]]s.<ref name="urlMotor neuron diseases">{{cite web |url=http://neuropathology.neoucom.edu/chapter9/chapter9fALS.html |title=Motor neuron diseases |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref>  There is no evidence of the degeneration of spinal motor neurons or muscle wasting ([[amyotrophy]]) that occurs in [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS).

==Symptoms and progression==
Onset of PLS usually occurs spontaneously after age 50 and progresses gradually over a number of years, or even decades. The disorder usually begins in the legs, but it may start in the tongue or the hands. Symptoms may include [[difficulty with balance]], weakness and stiffness in the legs, and [[clumsiness]]. Other common symptoms are [[spasticity]] (involuntary muscle contraction due to the stretching of muscle. Muscle contraction is dependent on the velocity of the stretch) in the hands, feet, or legs, [[foot dragging]], and speech and [[dysphagia|swallowing problem]]s due to involvement of the [[facial muscle]]s. Breathing may also become compromised in the later stages of the disease, causing those patients who develop ventilatory failure to require noninvasive ventilatory support.<ref name="emedicine.medscape"> {{cite web | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1171782-overview | title = Primary Lateral Sclerosis | accessdate = 2011-05-14}}</ref> [[Hyperreflexia]] is another key feature of PLS as seen in patients presenting with the [[Babinski's sign]].<ref name="rarediseases.about"> {{cite web | url = http://rarediseases.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&zTi=1&sdn=rarediseases&cdn=health&tm=814&f=00&su=p1051.2.336.ip_&tt=2&bt=0&bts=0&zu=http%3A//www.sp-foundation.org/pls.htm | title = Primary Lateral Sclerosis | accessdate = 2011-05-11 | date = February 15, 2009 | publisher = Spastic Paraplegia Foundation }}</ref>  Some people present with [[emotional lability]] and bladder urgency,<ref name="rarediseases.about" /> and occasionally people with PLS experience mild cognitive changes detectable on [[neuropsychological testing]], particularly on measures of [[executive function]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grace GM, Orange JB, Rowe A, Findlater K, Freedman M, Strong MJ |title=Neuropsychological Functioning in PLS: A Comparison with ALS |journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences  |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=88–97 |year=2011 |pmid=21156436}}</ref>

PLS is not considered hereditary when onset is in adulthood; however, [[juvenile primary lateral sclerosis]] (JPLS) has been linked to a mutation in the [[ALS2]] gene which encodes the cell-signalling protein alsin.<ref>{{cite book |author = Rollins YD, Oskarsson B, Ringel SP |chapter = Primary Lateral Sclerosis |editors = Lisak RP, Truong DD, Carroll WM, Bhidayasiri R |title = International Neurology: A Clinical Approach |publisher = Blackwell Publishing |year = 2009}}</ref>

The issue of whether PLS exists as a different entity from [[Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis | ALS]] is not clear, as some patients initially diagnosed as having PLS ultimately develop lower motor neuron signs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tartaglia MC, Rowe A, Findlater K, Orange JB, Grace G, Strong MJ |title=Differentiation between primary lateral sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: examination of symptoms and signs at disease onset and during follow-up |journal=Arch.

There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of PLS. Therefore, the diagnosis occurs as the result of eliminating other possible causes of the symptoms and by an extended observation period.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/primary_lateral_sclerosis/primary_lateral_sclerosis.htm | title = Primary Lateral Sclerosis Information Page | accessdate = 2011-05-11 | date = April 23, 2010 | publisher = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke}}</ref>

==Spasticity==

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) usually presents with gradual-onset, progressive, lower-extremity stiffness and pain due to muscle spasticity. Onset is often asymmetrical.<ref>Medscape: ''Diagnostic Considerations''</ref>Although the muscles do not appear to atrophy as in ALS (at least initially), the disabling aspect of PLS is muscle spasticity and cramping, and intense pain when those muscles are stretched, resulting in joint immobility. A  normal walking stride may become a tiny step shuffle with related instability and falling.

==Treatment==

Treatment for individuals with PLS is symptomatic. [[Baclofen]] and [[tizanidine]] may reduce spasticity. [[Quinine]] or [[phenytoin]] may decrease cramps. Some patients, who do not receive adequate relief from oral treatment, may consider intrathecal baclofen (i.e., infusion of medication directly into the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] via a surgically placed continuous infusion pump). However, patients are carefully selected for this type of procedure to ensure that they will likely benefit from this invasive procedure.

Physical therapy often helps prevent joint immobility. Speech therapy may be useful for those with involvement of the facial muscles. Physiotherapy treatment focuses on reducing muscle tone, maintaining or improving range of motion, increasing strength and coordination, and improving functional mobility. In PLS, stretching is thought to improve flexibility and can also reduce muscle [[spasticity]] and cramps.<ref name="rarediseases.about" />
Patients with PLS may find it beneficial to have an evaluation, as well as, follow-up visits at multidisciplinary clinics, similar to those available for people with ALS. These multidisciplinary clinics may provide patients with the necessary treatment that they require by having an occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech language pathologist, dietician and nutritionist, all in one site.<ref name="emedicine.medscape" />

==Prognosis==
Patients can often live with PLS for many years and very often outlive their neurological disease and succumb to some unrelated condition.  There is currently no effective cure, and the progression of symptoms varies. Some people may retain the ability to walk without assistance, but others eventually require [[wheelchairs]], [[Cane (tool)|canes]], or other assistive devices.
