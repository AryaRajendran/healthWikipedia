'''Brodmann area 6''' is part of the brain.

==Human==
Brodmann area 6 (BA6) is part of the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] in the [[human brain]]. Situated just anterior to the [[primary motor cortex]] ([[Brodmann area 4|BA4]]), it is composed of the [[premotor cortex]] and, medially, the [[supplementary motor area]], or SMA. This large area of the frontal cortex is believed to play a role in the planning of complex, coordinated movements.

Brodmann area 6 is also called '''agranular frontal area 6''' in humans because it lacks an internal granular cortical layer (layer IV). It is a subdivision of the [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitecturally]] defined precentral region of cerebral cortex. In the human brain, it is located on the portions of the [[precentral gyrus]] that are not occupied by the [[gigantopyramidal area 4]]; furthermore, BA6 extends onto the caudal portions of the [[superior frontal gyrus|superior frontal]] and [[middle frontal gyrus|middle frontal gyri]]. It extends from the [[cingulate sulcus]] on the medial aspect of the hemisphere to the [[lateral sulcus]] on the lateral aspect. It is bounded rostrally by the granular frontal region and caudally by the gigantopyramidal area 4 (Brodmann, 1909).

==Guenon==
Brodmann area 6 is a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal lobe of the [[guenon]]. Brodmann-1909 regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the human agranular frontal area 6 and noted that, in the monkey, area 4 is larger than area 6, whereas, in the human, area 6 is larger than area 4. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): It is thick relative to other cortical areas; the transition from cortex to subcortical [[white matter]] is gradual; cell layers are indistinct; and the internal [[granular layer]] (IV) is absent.
