A '''nipple shield''' is a nipple-shaped sheath worn over the [[areola]] and [[nipple]] during [[breastfeeding]]. Modern nipple shields are made of soft, thin, flexible [[silicone]] and have holes at the end of the nipple section to allow the [[breast milk]] to pass through. Older nipple shields were made of [[latex]] and harder, thicker plastics, and often caused more problems than they solved. A 17th century nipple shield held in [http://houses.shakespeare.org.uk/shakespeares-birthplace.html Shakespeare's birthplace] is made of [[pewter]].

Nipple shields are used in various situations:
* Some mothers have small or [[inverted nipple]]s which make it difficult for the baby to latch on. Using a shield allows for feeding to progress until the baby's suction draws out the nipple.
* Small, weak or sick babies often have difficulty latching on to the breast. A nipple shield makes latching easier and prevents the baby becoming discouraged.
* Babies who had to be bottle-fed since birth can become used to the [[Baby bottle|bottle teat]]. Nipple shields feel more like teats, and aid with the transition to breast feeding.
* A mother's nipples can become sore or cracked from breastfeeding. A shield allows the mother to continue breastfeeding until her [[cracked nipple]]s heal and she improves her latching technique.
* They make it easier to measure the quantity of milk consumed.

Most doctors and [[lactation consultant]]s stress that nipple shields use should be temporary; the aim is always to return to regular breastfeeding, unless otherwise indicated.

[[Breast shell]]s may be confused with nipple shields, but shields are intended for use during the act of breastfeeding, whereas breast shells are worn in preparation for breastfeeding.
