'''Sly syndrome''', also called '''Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII''' or '''MPS''', is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[lysosomal storage disease]] characterized by a deficiency of the [[enzyme]] [[β-glucuronidase]], a [[lysozome|lysosomal]] enzyme. Sly syndrome belongs to a group of disorders known as [[mucopolysaccharidoses]], which are lysosomal storage diseases. In Sly syndrome, the deficiency in β-glucuronidase leads to the accumulation of certain complex [[carbohydrate]]s ([[mucopolysaccharides]]) in many tissues and organs of the body.

It was named after its discoverer William S. Sly (1932-), an American Biochemist, in 1969 who has spent nearly his entire academic career at Saint Louis University. <ref name="title">{{cite web |url=http://www.slu.edu/x14852.xml |title=slu.edu |accessdate=2007-12-31 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref name="pmid4265197">{{cite journal |author=Sly WS, Quinton BA, McAlister WH, Rimoin DL |title=Beta glucuronidase deficiency: report of clinical, radiologic, and biochemical features of a new mucopolysaccharidosis |journal=J.

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Sly syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

The defective gene responsible for Sly syndrome is located on [[chromosome 7]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3376995 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3376995 |year=1988 |last1=Allanson |first1=JE |last2=Gemmill |first2=RM |last3=Hecht |first3=BK |last4=Johnsen |first4=S |last5=Wenger |first5=DA |title=Deletion mapping of the beta-glucuronidase gene. |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=517–522 |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The symptoms of Sly syndrome are similar to those of [[Hurler syndrome]] (MPS I). The symptoms include:

*in the head, neck, and face: coarse (Hurler-like) facies and macrocephaly, frontal prominence, premature closure of sagittal lambdoid sutures, and J-shaped sella turcica
*in the eyes: corneal opacity and iris coloboma
*in the nose: anteverted nostrils and a depressed nostril bridge
*in the mouth and oral areas: prominent alveolar processes and cleft palate
*in the thorax: usually [[pectus carinatum]] or exacavatum and oar-shaped ribs; also a protruding abdomen and inguinal or umbilical hernia
*in the extremities: talipes, an underdeveloped ilium, aseptic necrosis of femoral head, and shortness of tubular bones occurs
*in the spine: kyphosis or scoliosis and hook-like deformities in thoracic and lumbar vertebrate
*in the bones: dysostosis multiplex

In addition recurrent pulmonary infections occur. Hepatomegaly occurs in the gastrointestinal system. Splenomegaly occurs in the hematopoietic system. Inborn mucopolysaccharide metabolic disorders due to β-glucuronidase deficiency with granular inclusions in granulocytes occurs in the biochemical and metabolic systems. Growth and motor skills are affected, and mental retardation also occurs.

==Prevalence==
MPS type VII occurs in less than 1 in 250,000 births.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/mucopolysaccharidoses/detail_mucopolysaccharidoses.htm National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke > Mucopolysaccharidoses Fact Sheet] Last updated May 06, 2010</ref>

==Other names==
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII is also known as β-glucuronidase deficiency, β-glucuronidase deficiency mucopolysaccharidosis,
GUSB deficiency, mucopolysaccharide storage disease VII, MCA, and MR.
