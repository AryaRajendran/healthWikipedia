The '''cervical cap''' is a form of [[barrier contraception]].  A cervical cap fits over the [[cervix]] and blocks [[sperm]] from entering the [[uterus]] through the [[external orifice of the uterus]], called the ''os''.

==Terminology==
The term ''cervical cap'' has been used to refer to a number of barrier contraceptives, including the Prentif, Dumas, Vimule, and Oves devices.<ref name="CBAS">{{cite web |title=Cervical Caps |work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society |month=March | year=2005 |url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/cervicalcaps.cfm |accessdate=2008-04-26 }}</ref> In the United States, Prentif was the only brand available for several decades (Prentif was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2005).<ref name="CBAS" />  During this time, it was common to use the term ''cervical cap'' to refer exclusively to the Prentif brand.<ref name="hatcher">{{cite book | first=RA | last=Hatcher | year=2000 | title=Contraceptive Technology | edition=18th | publisher=Ardent Media | location=New York | isbn=0-9664902-6-6 | author-separator=, | author2=Trussel J | author3=Stewart F | display-authors=2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref><!--

Cervical caps or conception caps have also been designed as a form of [[assisted reproductive technology]], used to help people experiencing infertility.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf6/K063227.pdf</ref>

==History==
===Ancient===
The idea of blocking the cervix to prevent [[pregnancy]] is thousands of years old.  Various cultures have used cervix-shaped devices such as oiled [[paper]] cones or [[lemon]] halves.  Others made sticky mixtures that included [[honey]] or cedar [[rosin]], to be applied to the os.<ref name="pp2">{{cite web |title=A History of Birth Control Methods |work=Planned Parenthood |month=June | year=2002 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/resources/research-papers/bc-history-6547.htm |accessdate=2006-07-05 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The modern idea of a cervical cap as a fitted device that seals itself against the [[vagina]]l walls is of more recent origin; it emerged within the past century.

===19th century===
In 1838, German [[gynecologist]] [[Friedrich Wilde]] created the first modern cervical cap by making custom-made [[rubber]] molds of the cervix for some of his patients.<ref name="pp2" /> These caps were probably short-lived, as uncured rubber degrades fairly quickly.  An important precursor to the invention of more lasting caps was the rubber [[vulcanization]] process, patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1844. An occlusive [[pessary]] marketed in the United States as the "[[womb veil]]" seems to have been an early form of [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] or cervical cap.<ref>Janet Farrell Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America'' (Cornell University Press, 1994), p. 216 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Wbeoi0rGvpkC&pg=PA216&dq=%22womb+veil%22+inauthor:brodie&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22%20inauthor%3Abrodie&f=false online]; Andrea Tone, ''Devices and Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America'' (MacMillan, 2001), p. 14.</ref>

Over the next several decades, the cervical cap became the most widely used barrier contraceptive method in [[Western Europe]] and Britain. Although the diaphragm was always more popular in the United States than the cervical cap, the cap was also common.<ref name="weiss">{{cite journal |pmid=1990736 |year=1991 |last1=Weiss |first1=BD |last2=Bassford |first2=T |last3=Davis |first3=T |title=The cervical cap |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=517–23 |journal=American family physician}}</ref>

===20th century===
Many designs were developed in the later 19th and early 20th century.  The Vimule cap became available as early as 1927.  A book by Vimule and Co., published in 1898, advertises the Vimule Cap.<ref>{{cite web |title=the Vimule permanent sheath, as purveyed by Lamberts of London, 1927 |work=Condom pictures |url=http://www.lesleyahall.net/condillo.htm |accessdate=2006-11-12 }}</ref> The Prentif brand cap was introduced in the early 1930s.<!--

These [[stem pessary|stem pessaries]] became precursors to the modern [[intrauterine device]].

Use of all barrier methods, but especially cervical barriers, dropped dramatically after the 1960s introduction of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] and the intrauterine device. In 1976, the [[U.S. government]] enacted the [[Medical Device Amendment]]. This law required all manufacturers of [[medical device]]s to provide the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] with data on the safety and efficacy of those devices. Lamberts (Dalston) Ltd., the only manufacturer at that time, failed to provide this information, and the FDA banned the use of cervical caps in the United States.<ref name="weiss" />

In the late 1970s, the FDA reclassified the cervical cap as an [[investigational device]], and it regained limited availability.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7018094 |year=1980 |last1=Fairbanks |first1=B |last2=Scharfman |first2=B |title=The cervical cap: Past and current experience |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=61–80 |journal=Women & health}}</ref> Within a few years, the FDA withdrew investigational status from the Vimule cap, following a study that associated its use with vaginal [[laceration]]s.<ref name="weiss" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-7824(82)90143-3 |title=Studies of cervical caps: I.

==Types==
Several brands of caps were manufactured during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  They can be divided into two types: cavity rim caps, and other caps.  Cavity rim caps adhere to the cervix, while other caps adhere to the vaginal walls around the cervix.

The cavity rim caps are Prentif, made of latex, and the disposable cap Oves, made of silicone. There are four sizes of Prentif: 22, 25, 28, and 31&nbsp;mm.  There are three sizes of Oves: 26, 28, and 30&nbsp;mm.  Unique among cervical caps, it adheres to the cervix by [[surface tension]], rather than by suction.<ref name="CBAS">{{cite web |title=Cervical Caps |work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society |month=March | year=2005 |url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/cervicalcaps.cfm |accessdate=2008-04-19 }}</ref>

The other devices are the latex Dumas and Vimule, and the silicone FemCap, Lea's Shield, and Shanghai Lily. There are five sizes of Dumas: 50, 55, 60, 65, and 75&nbsp;mm.  There are three sizes of Vimule: 42, 48, and 52&nbsp;mm.  There are three sizes of FemCap: 22, 26, and 30&nbsp;mm.  There are four sizes of Shanghai Lily: 54, 58, 62, and 66&nbsp;mm.  Lea's Shield is manufactured in a single size.  Unlike the other caps, Lea's Shield has a one-way air valve that helps it seal to the vaginal walls.  The valve also allows the passage of [[cervical mucus]]. FemCap does not have such a valve and as such can be used to collect cervical mucus to support the [[billings method]].<ref>http://ethicalfamilyplanning.com/resources/femcap/femcap_to_predict_fertility_window.php</ref> Both Lea's Shield and FemCap have loops to assist in removal.<ref name="CBAS" />

Shanghai Lily is only available in [[People's Republic of China|China]].<ref name="CBAS" />  As of 2008, many of the other devices are no longer being manufactured: Prentif, Vimule, and Dumas have been discontinued.<ref>'''Prentif''': {{cite web | title = Birth control options: the Cedar River Clinic's Birth Control Chart | work = Women's Health Activist | publisher = AccessMyLibrary.com | date = 2007-07-01 | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-32457706_ITM | accessdate = 2008-07-11 |quote=The Prentif cap is no longer being manufactured, but some clinics still have it in stock.}}<br />

==Fitting==
[[Image:Contraception cape cervicale.jpg|thumb|Position of a cavity rim cap]]
Individuals who wish to use a cervical cap are screened by a [[health care provider]] to determine if a cervical cap, or one brand of cap, is appropriate for them.  If a cap is determined to be appropriate, the provider will determine the proper size.  The user must be refitted after any duration of pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is [[abortion|aborted]], [[miscarriage|miscarried]], or carried to term through vaginal [[childbirth]] or [[caesarean section]].<ref name="pp" />

Several factors may make a cap inappropriate for a particular woman.  Women who have given birth may have scar tissue or irregularly shaped [[cervix]]es that interfere with the cap forming a good seal.<ref name="fwhc2">{{cite web |title=Cervical Cap - Q&A |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center  |month=January | year=2006  |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/capinfo2.htm |accessdate=2008-04-19 }}</ref>  For some women, available sizes of cervical caps do not provide a correct fit.  Also, cavity rim caps are not recommended for women with an anteflexed uterus.<!--

==Use==
The first step in inserting or removing a cervical cap is [[handwashing]], to avoid introducing harmful [[bacteria]] into the vaginal canal.<ref name="pp">{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Jennifer |title=Diaphragm, Cervical Cap and Shield |publisher=Planned Parenthood |date=Published: January 01, 2004, Updated: December 01, 2005  |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/diaphragm-cervical-cap-shield-4244.htm |accessdate=2008-04-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080325011659/http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/diaphragm-cervical-cap-shield-4244.htm |archivedate = March 25, 2008}}</ref>  The cap is inserted prior to [[sexual intercourse]];<ref name="CBAS" /> some sources state that insertion prior to [[sexual arousal]] decreases the risk of incorrect placement.<ref name="femcapdirections">{{cite web |title=Directions for use |publisher=FemCap |year=2007 |url=http://www.femcap.com/directions.htm |accessdate=2008-04-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080310075905/http://www.femcap.com/directions.htm |archivedate = March 10, 2008}}</ref>  Most sources recommend the use of [[spermicide]] with the cap,<ref name="CBAS" /><ref name="pp" /><ref name="femcapdirections" /><ref name="ovesinstructions">{{cite web |title=Instructions for Use |publisher=Veos PLC |year=2003 |url=http://www.oves.com/english/html/consumer/consumer_usage.htm |accessdate=2008-04-19 }}</ref> but some sources say spermicide use is optional.<!--

The cap remains in the vagina for a minimum of 6<ref name="femcapdirections" /><ref name="ovesinstructions" /> or 8<ref name="CBAS" /><ref name="fpn" /> hours after the last intravaginal [[ejaculation]].  It is recommended the cap be removed within 72 hours (within 48 hours recommended in the U.S.)<ref name="CBAS" />  Other than the disposable Oves cap, after use cervical caps are washed and stored for reuse.<ref name="fwhc">{{cite web |title=Cervical Cap |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center  |month=September | year=2006  |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/capinfo.htm |accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref>  Silicone devices may be boiled to sterilize them.<ref name=video>[http://www.leasshield.com/images/leasvideo.mpg Instructional video]</ref>  Reusable caps may last for one<ref name="femcapfaq">{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=FemCap |year=2007 |url=http://www.femcap.com/faq.htm |accessdate=2008-04-19 }}</ref> or two<ref name="pp" /> years.

==Effectiveness==
The effectiveness of cervical caps, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed two ways: ''method effectiveness'' and ''actual effectiveness''.  The method effectiveness is the proportion of couples correctly and consistently using the method who do not become pregnant.  Actual effectiveness is the proportion of couples who intended that method as their sole form of birth control and do not become pregnant; it includes couples who sometimes use the method incorrectly, or sometimes not at all.  Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.

''Contraceptive Technology'' reports that the method failure rate of the Prentif cervical cap with spermicide is 9% per year for [[Parity (medicine)|nulliparous]] women (women who have never given birth), and 26% per year for parous women.<!--
 --><ref name="hatcher"/>  The actual pregnancy rates among Prentif users vary depending on the population being studied, with yearly rates of 11%<ref name="eighties">{{cite journal |pmid=2664609 |year=1989 |last1=Richwald |first1=GA |last2=Greenland |first2=S |last3=Gerber |first3=MM |last4=Potik |first4=R |last5=Kersey |first5=L |last6=Comas |first6=MA |title=Effectiveness of the cavity-rim cervical cap: Results of a large clinical study |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology}}</ref> to 32%<ref name="hatcher" /> being reported.

Little data is available on the effectiveness of the Oves cap and Femcap.  The Oves manufacturer cites one small study of 17 users.<ref name=ovesdata>[http://www.oves.com/english/html/medical/medical_data.htm Oves Medical Data]</ref> The Femcap website does not cite any data on the current version of the Femcap; but lists data for an older version which is no longer approved by the FDA.<ref name=femcapfaq />

The only effectiveness trial of Lea's Shield was too small to determine method effectiveness. The actual pregnancy rate was 15% per year.  Of the women in the trial, 85% were [[Parity (medicine)|parous]] (had given birth).  The study authors estimate that for nulliparous women (those who have never given birth) the pregnancy rate in typical use may be lower, around 5% per year.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-7824(96)00081-9 |title=Lea's Shield®: A study of the safety and efficacy of a new vaginal barrier contraceptive used with and without spermicide |year=1996 |last1=Mauck |first1=Christine |last2=Glover |first2=Lucinda H. |last3=Miller |first3=Eric |last4=Allen |first4=Susan |last5=Archer |first5=David F. |last6=Blumenthal |first6=Paul |last7=Rosenzweig |first7=Bruce A. |last8=Dominik |first8=Rosalie |last9=Sturgen |first9=Kim |journal=Contraception |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=329–35 |pmid=8773419}}</ref>

The study of the Oves cap reported that few women indicated that they would use the cap in the future.

A pilot study conducted in Britain prior to the Lea's Shield's approval concluded that the Lea's Shield "may be acceptable to a highly select minority of women".<ref name=PMID10023094>{{cite journal |pmid=10023094 |year=1999 |last1=Bounds |first1=W |last2=Guillebaud |first2=J |title=Lea's Shield contraceptive device: Pilot study of its short-term patient acceptability and aspects of use |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=117–20 |journal=The British journal of family planning}}</ref>

As of 2002, the cervical cap was one of the least common methods of [[contraception]] in the United States.  A 2002 study indicated that of sexually active American women, 0.6% are currently using either the cervical cap, [[contraceptive sponge]], or [[female condom]] as their primary method of contraception, and fewer than 1% have ever used a cervical cap.<!--
