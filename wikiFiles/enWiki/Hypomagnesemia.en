'''Hypomagnesemia''' (or '''hypomagnesaemia''') is an [[electrolyte disturbance]] in which there is an abnormally low level of [[magnesium]] in the blood.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000051688|hypomagnesemia}}</ref> Normal magnesium levels in humans fall between 1.5 - 2.5&nbsp;mg/dL.  Usually a serum level less than 0.7&nbsp;mmol/L is used as reference for hypomagnesemia (not hypomagnesia which refers to low magnesium content in food/supplement sources).  The prefix hypo- means low (contrast with hyper-, meaning high). The root 'magnes' refers to magnesium. The suffix of the word, -emia, means 'in the blood.'

Hypomagnesemia is not equal to [[magnesium deficiency (medicine)|magnesium deficiency]]. Hypomagnesemia can be present without [[magnesium deficiency (medicine)|magnesium deficiency]] and vice versa.  Note, however, that hypomagnesemia is usually indicative of a systemic magnesium deficit.

Hypomagnesemia may result from a number of conditions including inadequate intake of magnesium, chronic [[diarrhea]], [[malabsorption]], [[alcoholism]], [[chronic stress]], and medications such as [[diuretic]]s use among others.

==Signs and symptoms==
Deficiency of magnesium causes weakness, muscle cramps, [[cardiac arrhythmia]], increased irritability of the [[nervous system]] with  tremors, [[athetosis]], jerking, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] and an extensor [[plantar reflex]]. In addition, there may be confusion, disorientation, [[hallucinations]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], epileptic [[Convulsion|fits]], [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]] and [[tetany (medical sign)|tetany]].

==Causes==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
Magnesium deficiency is not uncommon in hospitalized patients. Elevated levels of magnesium ([[hypermagnesemia]]), however, are nearly always [[iatrogenic]]. Ten to twenty percent of all [[hospital]] patients and 60–65% of patient in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) have hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia is underdiagnosed, as testing for serum magnesium levels is not routine.

Low levels of magnesium in blood may mean that there is not enough magnesium in the diet, the intestines are not absorbing enough magnesium, or the kidneys are excreting too much magnesium. Deficiencies may be due to the following conditions:

===Drugs===
* Alcoholism. Hypomagnesemia occurs in 30% of [[alcohol abuse]] and 85% in [[delirium tremens]], due to [[malnutrition]] and chronic [[diarrhea]]. Alcohol stimulates renal excretion of magnesium, which is also increased because of alcoholic and diabetic [[ketoacidosis]], [[hypophosphatemia]] and [[hyperaldosteronism]] resulting from liver disease. Also, hypomagnesemia is related to [[thiamine]] deficiency because magnesium is needed for transforming thiamine into thiamine pyrophosphate.

===Medications===
* Loop and thiazide diuretic use (the most common cause of hypomagnesemia)<ref name="homeo">{{cite journal |author=Whang R, Hampton EM, Whang DD |title=Magnesium homeostasis and clinical disorders of magnesium deficiency |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=220–6 |year=1994 |pmid=8173141 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
* Antibiotics (i.e. [[aminoglycoside]], [[amphotericin]], [[pentamidine]], [[gentamicin]], [[tobramycin]], [[viomycin]]) block resorption in the [[loop of Henle]]. 30% of patients using these antibiotics have hypomagnesemia,
* Long term use of [[proton pump inhibitors]] such as omeprazole.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm245275.htm</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheen|first=E|coauthors=Triadafilopoulos, G|title=Adverse effects of long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy.|journal=Digestive diseases and sciences|date=2011 Apr|volume=56|issue=4|pages=931–50|pmid=21365243}}</ref>
* Other drugs.
** [[Digitalis]], displaces magnesium into the cell. Digitalis causes an increased intracellular concentration of sodium, which in turn increases intracellular calcium by passively decreasing the action of the sodium-calcium exchanger in the sarcolemma. The increased intracellular calcium gives a positive inotropic effect.<ref name="homeo" />
** [[Adrenergics]], displace magnesium into the cell
** [[Cisplatin]], stimulates renal excretion
** [[Ciclosporin]], stimulates renal excretion
** [[Mycophenolate mofetil]]
* Insufficient selenium,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chareonpong-Kawamoto N, Yasumoto K |title=Selenium deficiency as a cause of overload of iron and unbalanced distribution of other minerals |journal=Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=302–6 |year=1995 |pmid=7766029 |doi= 10.1271/bbb.59.302|url=}}</ref> vitamin D, sunlight exposure or vitamin B6
* Gastrointestinal causes: the distal tractus digestivus secretes high levels of magnesium. Therefore, secretory diarrhea can cause hypomagnesemia. Thus,  [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Whipple's disease]] and [[coeliac disease|celiac sprue]] can all cause hypomagnesemia.
* Renal magnesium loss in [[Bartter's syndrome]],<ref name="cameron" /> postobstructive diuresis, diuretic phase of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and [[kidney transplant]]
* Diabetes Mellitus: 38% of diabetic outpatient clinic visits involve hypomagnesemia, probably through renal loss because of [[glycosuria]] or [[ketoaciduria]].
* [[Acute myocardial infarction]]: within the first 48 hours after a heart attack, 80% of patients have hypomagnesemia. This could be the result of an intracellular shift because of an increase in catecholamines.
* [[Malabsorption]]
* [[Acute pancreatitis]]
* [[Hydrogen fluoride]] poisoning
* Gitelman/Bartter Syndromes
* Massive transfusion (MT) is a lifesaving treatment of hemorrhagic shock, but can be associated with significant complications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sihler|first=KC|coauthors=Napolitano, LM|title=Complications of massive transfusion.|journal=Chest|date=2010 Jan|volume=137|issue=1|pages=209–20|pmid=20051407}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

===Homeostasis===
The body contains 21–28&nbsp;grams of magnesium (0.864–1.152&nbsp;mol). Of this, 53% is located in [[bone]], 19% in non-muscular tissue, and 1% in [[extracellular fluid]]. For this reason, blood levels of magnesium are not an adequate means of establishing the total amount of available magnesium.
Most of the serum magnesium is bound to chelators, (i.e. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[protein]]s and [[citrate]]). Roughly 33% is bound to proteins, and 5–10% is not bound. This "free" magnesium is essential in regulating intracellular magnesium. Normal plasma Mg is 1.7–2.3&nbsp;mg/dl (0.69–0.94&nbsp;mmol/l). Of this 60% is free, 33% is bound to proteins, and less than 7% is bound to citrate, [[bicarbonate]] and [[phosphate]].

Magnesium is abundant in nature. It can be found in green [[vegetable]]s, [[chlorophyll]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] derivatives, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[wheat]], [[seafood]], and [[meat]]. It is absorbed primarily in the duodenum of the [[small intestine]]. The [[rectum]] and [[sigmoid colon]] can absorb magnesium. [[Hypermagnesemia]] has been reported after enemas containing magnesium. Forty percent of dietary magnesium is absorbed. Hypomagnesemia stimulates and hypermagnesemia inhibits this absorption.

The [[kidney]]s regulate the serum magnesium. About 2400&nbsp;mg of magnesium passes through the kidneys daily, of which 5% (120&nbsp;mg) is excreted through [[urine]]. The [[loop of Henle]] is the major site for magnesium homeostasis, and 60% is reasorbed.

Magnesium homeostasis comprises three systems: kidney, small intestine, and bone. In the acute phase of magnesium deficiency there is an increase in absorption in the distal small intestine and tubular resorption in the kidneys. When this condition persists, serum magnesium drops and is corrected with magnesium from bone tissue. The level of intracellular magnesium is controlled through the reservoir in bone tissue.

===Metabolism===
Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 [[enzyme]]-regulated reactions, most importantly forming and using ATP, i.e., kinase.<ref name="cameron">{{cite journal |author=al-Ghamdi SM, Cameron EC, Sutton RA |title=Magnesium deficiency: pathophysiologic and clinical overview |journal=Am. J. Kidney Dis. |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=737–52 |year=1994 |pmid=7977315 |doi= |url=}}</ref> There is a direct effect on sodium (Na), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) channels. It has several effects:
*Potassium channels are inhibited (closed) by magnesium. Hypomagnesemia results in increased [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] of intracellular potassium in the distal nephron of the kidney (and out of the body in urinary losses). This condition is believed to occur secondary to the decreased normal physiologic magnesium inhibition of the [[ROMK]] channels in the apical tubular membrane.<ref name="huang">{{cite journal |author=Huang, CL, Kuo E|title=Mechanism of Hypokalemia in Magnesium Deficiency|journal=J Am Soc Nephrol. |volume=18 |pages=2649–2652 |year=2007|pmid=17804670 |doi=10.1681/ASN.2007070792 |issue=10}}</ref> In hypokalemic patients who do not respond to oral potassium supplementation, frequently, hypomagnesemia is the cause; if it is corrected, the oral potassium will then become effective.  For example, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) commonly being treated with insulin, a hormone which drives extracellular potassium intracellularly, must have their magnesium monitored and corrected so that supplemented potassium is not lost in the urine.  That is, the magnesium binds to and shuts off the "potassium sink" losses.
*Release of calcium from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] is inhibited by magnesium. Low levels of magnesium stimulate the release of calcium and thereby an intracellular level of calcium. This effect similar to calcium inhibitors makes it "nature's [[Calcium channel blocker|calcium inhibitor]]." Lack of magnesium inhibits the release of [[parathyroid hormone]], which can result in [[hypoparathyroidism]] and [[hypocalcemia]]. Furthermore, it makes skeletal and muscle receptors less sensitive to parathyroid hormone.
*Through relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle it causes [[bronchodilation]].
*The neurological effects are:
**reducing electrical excitation
**blocking release of [[acetylcholine]]
**blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate ([[NMDA]]) [[glutamate]] receptors, an excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] of the central nervous system.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis can be made by finding a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] magnesium concentration of less than 0.7&nbsp;mmol/l. Since most magnesium is intracellular, a body deficit can be present with a normal plasma concentration.
In addition to hypomagnesemia, up to 40% cases will also have hypocalcemia while in up to 60% of cases, hypokalemia will also be present.
The [[ECG]] shows a prolonged QT interval.

==Treatment==
Treatment of hypomagnesemia depends on the degree of deficiency and the clinical effects. Oral replacement is appropriate for patients with mild symptoms, while intravenous replacement is indicated for patients with severe clinical effects.<ref name="therapeutics">{{cite journal |author=Durlach J, Durlach V, Bac P, Bara M, Guiet-Bara A |title=Magnesium and therapeutics |journal=Magnes Res |volume=7 |issue=3–4 |pages=313–28 |year=1994 |pmid=7786695 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Numerous [[oral magnesium preparation]]s are available. [[Magnesium oxide]], one of the most common because it has high magnesium content per weight, has been reported to be the least [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]].<ref name=Firoz2001>{{cite journal |author=Firoz M, Graber M |title=Bioavailability of US commercial magnesium preparations |journal=Magnes Res |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=257–62 |year=2001 |pmid=11794633}}</ref><ref name=Lindberg1990>{{cite journal |author=Lindberg JS, Zobitz MM, Poindexter JR, Pak CY |title=Magnesium bioavailability from magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=48–55 |year=1990|pmid=2407766}}</ref> [[Magnesium citrate]] has been reported as more bioavailable than oxide or amino-acid chelate (glycinate) forms.<ref name=Walker2003>{{cite journal |author=Walker AF, Marakis G, Christie S, Byng M |title=Mg citrate found more bioavailable than other Mg preparations in a randomised, double-blind study |journal=Magnes Res |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=183–91 |year=2003|pmid=14596323|url=http://www.john-libbey-eurotext.fr/medline.md?issn=0953-1424&vol=16&iss=3&page=183}}</ref>

Intravenous [[magnesium sulfate]] (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) can be given in the following conditions:

===Arrhythmia===
Magnesium is needed for the adequate function of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase]] pumps in the cells of the [[heart]]. A lack of it depolarizes and results in [[tachyarrhythmia]]. Magnesium inhibits release of [[potassium]], a lack of magnesium increases loss of potassium. Intracellular levels of potassium decrease and the cells depolarize. [[Digoxin]] increases this effect. Both digoxin and hypomagnesemia inhibit the Na-K pump resulting in decreased intracellular potassium.

Magnesium intravenously helps in refractory arrhythmia, most notably [[torsade de pointes]].<ref name="therapeutics" /> Others are [[ventricular tachycardia]], [[supraventricular tachycardia]] and [[atrial fibrillation]].<ref name="cardiac">{{cite journal |author=Ramsay JG |title=Cardiac management in the ICU |journal=Chest |volume=115 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=138S–144S |year=1999 |pmid=10331347 |doi= 10.1378/chest.115.suppl_2.138S|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10331347}}</ref>

The effect is based upon decreased excitability by depolarization and the slowing down of electric signals in the AV-node. Magnesium is a negative inotrope as a result of decrease calcium influx and calcium release from intracellular storage. It is just as effective as [[verapamil]]. In [[myocardial infarction]] there is a functional lack of magnesium, supplementation will decrease mortality.<ref name="cardiac" />

===Obstetric===
Most importantly [[pre-eclampsia]]. It has an indirect antithrombotic effect upon thrombocytes and the endothelial functions (increase in [[prostaglandin]], decrease in [[thromboxane]], decrease in [[angiotensin II]]), microvascular leakage and vasospasm through its function similar to [[calcium channel blocker]]s.

[[Convulsion]]s are the result of cerebral vasospasm. The vasodilatatory effect of magnesium seems to be the major mechanism.

===Electrolyte disturbances===
*[[Hypokalemia]]: 42% of patients with hypokalemia also have hypomagnesemia, which is why they may not be responding to potassium supplementation. Magnesium is needed for the ATPase, Na-K-pump.
*Hypomagnesemia is present in 33% of patients in the intensive care unit not responding to calcium supplementation. This is because of decreased function of the calcium pump, but also because of a decreased release of calcium by inhibition of [[parathyroid hormone]] release.

===Pulmonary===
Acute [[asthma]]: here there is a bronchodilatatory effect, probably by antagonizing a calcium-mediated constriction.<ref name="asthma">{{cite journal |author=Mills R, Leadbeater M, Ravalia A |title=Intravenous magnesium sulphate in the management of refractory bronchospasm in a ventilated asthmatic |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=52 |issue=8 |pages=782–5 |year=1997 |pmid=9291766 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2044.1997.176-az0312.x|url=}}</ref> Also, adrenergic stimulation, i.e.  sympatheticomimetics used for treatment of asthma, might lower serum levels of magnesium, which must therefore be supplemented.
