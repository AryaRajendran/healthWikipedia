The '''ilium''' is the uppermost and largest bone of the [[pelvis]], and appears in most [[vertebrates]] including [[mammals]] and [[birds]], but not [[bony fish]].  All reptiles have an ilium except [[snakes]], although some snake species have a tiny bone which is considered to be an ilium.<ref name=reptiles_disease_book>

The name comes from the [[Latin]] (''[[wikt:ile#Latin|ile]]'', ''ilis''), meaning "groin" or "flank."<ref name="isbn0-8036-1207-9">{{cite book |author=Taber, Clarence Wilbur; Venes, Donald |title=Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary |publisher=F.A.

The ilium of the [[human]] is divisible into two parts, the body and the ala; the separation is indicated on the top surface by a curved line, the arcuate line, and on the external surface by the margin of the [[acetabulum]].

==Body (corpus ossis ilii)==
The body enters into the formation of the [[acetabulum]], of which it forms rather less than two-fifths. 

Its external surface is partly articular, partly non-articular; the articular segment forms part of the lunate surface of the acetabulum, the non-articular portion contributes to the acetabular fossa.

The internal surface of the body is part of the wall of the lesser pelvis and gives origin to some fibers of the [[Obturator internus]]. 

Below, it is continuous with the pelvic surfaces of the [[ischium]] and [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], only a faint line indicating the place of union.

==Ala (ala ossis ilii)==
{{Further|Wing of ilium}}
The ''wing of ilium'' (or ''ala'') is the large expanded portion which bounds the [[greater pelvis]] laterally. It presents for examination two surfaces—an external and an internal—a crest, and two borders—an anterior and a posterior.

== Biiliac width ==

In humans, '''biiliac width''' is an anatomical term referring to the widest measure of the pelvis between the outer edges of the upper iliac bones.

Biiliac width has the following common synonyms: [[pelvic bone]] width, biiliac breadth, intercristal breadth/width, bi-iliac breadth/width and biiliocristal breadth/width.

In the average adult female, it measures 28 [[Centimetre|cm]] (11 [[inches|in]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

--->It is best measured by anthropometric [[caliper]]s (an anthropometer designed for such measurement is called a pelvimeter). Attempting to measure biiliac width with a [[tape measure]] along a curved surface is inaccurate. 

The biiliac width measure is helpful in [[obstetrics]] because a pelvis that is significantly too small or too large can have obstetrical complications. For example, a large baby or a small pelvis often lead to death unless a [[caesarean section]] is performed.<ref>{{cite web

It is also used by [[anthropologists]] to estimate body mass.<ref>{{cite journal

==In dinosaurs==
The [[clade]] [[Dinosaur]]ia is divided into the [[Saurischia]] and [[Ornithischia]] based on [[pelvis|hip structure]], including importantly that of the ilium.<ref>Seeley, H.G. (1888).
