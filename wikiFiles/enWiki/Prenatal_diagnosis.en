'''Prenatal diagnosis''' or '''prenatal screening''' (note that "Prenatal Diagnosis" and "Prenatal Screening" refer to two different types of tests) is [[Experiment|testing]] for diseases or conditions in a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] before it is born. The aim is to detect [[birth defect]]s such as [[neural tube defect]]s, [[Down syndrome]], [[chromosome]] abnormalities, [[genetic disease]]s and other conditions, such as [[spina bifida]], [[cleft palate]], [[Tay Sachs disease]], [[sickle cell anemia]], [[thalassemia]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Muscular dystrophy]], and [[fragile X syndrome]]. Screening can also be used for [[prenatal sex discernment]].  Common testing procedures include [[amniocentesis]], [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] including [[nuchal translucency]] ultrasound, serum marker testing, or genetic screening. In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the fetus will be [[abortion|aborted]], though physicians and patients also find it useful to diagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a tertiary care hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care.

Fetal screening has also been done to determine characteristics generally not considered birth defects, and avail for e.g. [[sex selection]]. The rise of [[designer babies]] and parental selection for specific traits raises a host of [[bioethics|bioethical]] and legal issues that will dominate [[reproductive rights]] debates in the 21st century.

==Invasiveness==
Diagnostic prenatal testing can be by [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] or [[Non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] methods. An invasive method involves probes or needles being inserted into the [[uterus]], e.g. [[amniocentesis]], which can be done from about 14 weeks gestation, and usually up to about 20 weeks, and [[chorionic villus sampling]], which can be done earlier (between 9.5 and 12.5 weeks gestation) but which may be slightly more risky to the fetus. One study comparing transabdominal chorionic villus sampling with second trimester amniocentesis found no signiﬁcant difference in the total pregnancy loss between the two procedures.<ref name=Alfirevic>[http://apps.who.int/rhl/reviews/langs/CD003252.pdf Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis (Review)]. By Alfirevic Z, Mujezinovic F, Sundberg K at [[The Cochrane Collaboration]], 2009</ref> However, [[transcervical]] chorionic villus sampling carries a signiﬁcantly higher risk, compared with a second trimester amniocentesis, of total pregnancy loss ([[relative risk]] 1.40; 95% [[confidence interval]] 1.09 to 1.81) and spontaneous miscarriage (9.4% risk; relative risk 1.50; 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.11).<ref name=Alfirevic/>

Non-invasive techniques include examinations of the woman's womb through [[ultrasonography]] and maternal serum screens (i.e. [[Alpha-fetoprotein]]). Blood tests for select trisomies (Down syndrome in the United States, Down and Edwards syndromes in China) <!-- as of October 2011 --> based on detecting fetal DNA present in maternal blood have become available.<ref>http://www.sequenomcmm.com/home/</ref><ref name=Palomaki>{{cite journal

==Fetal versus maternal==
Some screening tests performed on the woman are intended to detect traits or characteristics of the [[fetus]].  Others detect conditions in the woman that may have an [[adverse effect]] on the fetus, or that threaten the pregnancy.  For example, abnormally low levels of the serum marker [[Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A|PAPP-A]] have been shown to correspond to an increased risk of [[pre-eclampsia]], in which the mother's high blood pressure can threaten the pregnancy, though many physicians find regular blood-pressure monitoring to be more reliable.

==Reasons for prenatal diagnosis==
There are three purposes of prenatal diagnosis: (1) to enable timely medical or surgical treatment of a condition before or after birth, (2) to give the parents the chance to abort a fetus with the diagnosed condition, and (3) to give parents the chance to "prepare" psychologically, socially, financially, and medically for a baby with a health problem or disability, or for the likelihood of a stillbirth.
Often, the child’s quality of life is a product of societies response to his/her impairment. Where traditional societies are concerned, prenatal testing is a means to prevent the birth of individuals who would otherwise be denied full personhood in life<ref>Gail Landsman, Emplotting children's lives: developmental delay vs. disability," Social Science and Medicine 56: 1947-1960</ref>

Having this information in advance of the birth means that healthcare staff as well as parents can better prepare themselves for the delivery of a child with a health problem.  For example, Down Syndrome is associated with cardiac defects that may need intervention immediately upon birth.

Many expectant parents would like to know the sex of their baby before birth.  Methods include [[amniocentesis]] with [[karyotype|karyotyping]], and prenatal [[ultrasound]].  In some countries, health care providers are expected to withhold this information from parents, while in other countries they are expected to give this information.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Qualifying risk factors===
Because of the miscarriage and fetal damage risks associated with amniocentesis and CVS procedures, many women prefer to first undergo screening so they can find out if the fetus' risk of birth defects is high enough to justify the risks of invasive testing.  Since screening tests yield a risk score which represents the chance that the baby has the birth defect, the most common threshold for high-risk is 1:270.  A risk score of 1:300 would therefore be considered low-risk by many physicians.  However, the trade-off between risk of birth defect and risk of complications from invasive testing is relative and subjective; some parents may decide that even a 1:1000 risk of birth defects warrants an invasive test while others wouldn't opt for an invasive test even if they had a 1:10 risk score.

[[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]] guidelines currently recommend that all pregnant women, regardless of age, be offered invasive testing to obtain a definitive diagnosis of certain birth defects.  Therefore, most physicians offer diagnostic testing to all their patients, with or without prior screening and let the patient decide.

The following are some reasons why a patient might consider her risk of birth defects already to be high enough to warrant skipping screening and going straight for invasive testing.

*Women over the age of 35
*Women who have previously had premature babies or babies with a birth defect, especially heart or genetic problems
*Women who have [[high blood pressure]], [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], or [[epilepsy]]
*Women who have family histories or ethnic backgrounds prone to genetic disorders, or whose partners have these
*Women who are pregnant with multiples (twins or more)
*Women who have previously had miscarriages

==Methods of prenatal screening and diagnosis==

There are multiple ways of classifying the methods available, including the invasiveness and the time performed.

===Maternal serum screening===
First trimester maternal serum screening can check levels of free β-[[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], [[Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A|PAPP-A]], [[alpha fetoprotein]], intact or beta hCG, inhibin-A, or h-hCG in the woman's [[blood plasma|serum]], and combine these with the measurement of [[nuchal translucency]] (NT). Some institutions also look for the presence of a fetal nasalbone on the ultrasound.

Second trimester maternal serum screening ([[AFP screening]], triple screen, quad screen, or penta screen) can check levels of [[alpha fetoprotein]], β-[[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], [[inhibin]]-A, [[estriol]], and h-hCG (hyperglycosolated hCG) in the woman's [[blood plasma|serum]].

The [[triple test]] measures [[Blood serum|serum]] levels of [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]], [[estriol]], and [[beta-hCG]], with a 70% [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] and 5% [[false-positive]] rate.  It is complemented in some regions of the United States, as the ''Quad test'' (adding inhibin A to the panel, resulting in an 81% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for detecting [[Down syndrome]] when taken at 15–18 weeks of [[gestational age]]).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1258/jms.2009.009017}}</ref>

The biomarkers [[PAPP-A]] and β-[[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] seem to be altered for pregnancies resulting from ICSI, causing a higher false-positive rate. Correction factors have been developed and
should be used when screening for Down’s syndrome in singleton pregnancies after ICSI,<ref name=Gjerris2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms010}}</ref> but in twin pregnancies such correction factors have not been fully elucidated.<ref name=Gjerris2012/> In [[vanishing twin]] pregnancies with a second gestational sac with a dead fetus, first trimester screening should be based solely on the maternal age and the nuchal translucency scan as biomarkers are significantly altered in these cases.<ref name=Gjerris2012/>

==Advances in Prenatal Screening==

Measurement of [[fetal protein]]s in maternal serum is a part of standard prenatal screening for [[Diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy|fetal aneuploidy]] and [[neural tube defects]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ball RH, Caughey AB, Malone FD, ''et al.'' |title=First- and second-trimester evaluation of risk for Down syndrome |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=10–7 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17601890 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000263470.89007.e3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Dashe J.S., Twickler D.M., McIntire D.D., Ramus R.M. | year = 2006 | title = Alpha-fetoprotein Deduction of Neural Tube Defects and the Impact of Standard Ultrasound | url = http://rc.kfshrc.edu.sa/rcf/E_Library/NTDR/Alphafeto%20protein%20detection..pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] | volume = 195 | issue = 6| pages = 1623–1628 }}</ref>  Computational predictive model shows that extensive and diverse feto-maternal protein trafficking occurs during pregnancy and can be readily detected non-invasively in maternal [[whole blood]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maron JL, Alterovitz G, Ramoni M, Johnson KL, Bianchi DW |title=High-Throughput Discovery and Characterization of Fetal Protein Trafficking in the Blood of Pregnant Women |journal=Proteomics Clin Appl |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=1389–1396 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=20186258 |pmc=2825712 |doi=10.1002/prca.200900109}}</ref> This computational approach circumvented a major limitation, the abundance of maternal proteins interfering with the detection of fetal proteins, to fetal proteomic analysis of maternal blood. Entering fetal gene transcripts previously identified in maternal whole blood into a computational predictive model helped develop a comprehensive proteomic network of the term neonate. It also shows that the fetal proteins detected in pregnant woman’s blood originate from a diverse group of tissues and organs from the developing fetus. Development proteomic networks dominate the functional characterization of the predicted proteins, illustrating the potential clinical application of this technology as a way to monitor normal and abnormal fetal development.

The difference in [[DNA methylation|methylation]] of specific DNA sequences between mother and fetus can be used to identify fetal-specific DNA in the blood circulation of the mother.  In a study published in March 6, 2011 online issue of [[Nature journal]], using this non-invasive technique a group of investigators from Greece and UK achieved correct diagnosis of 14 [[trisomy 21]] ([[Down Syndrome]]) and 26 normal cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Papageorgiou EA, Karagrigoriou A, Tsaliki E, Velissariou V, Carter NP, Patsalis PC |title=Fetal-specific DNA methylation ratio permits noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 |journal=Nat.

Based on its [[sensitivity and specificity]], it constitutes an advanced screening test and that positive results require confirmation by an invasive test, and that while effective in the diagnosis of Down syndrome, it cannot assess half the abnormalities detected by invasive testing. The test is not recommended for general use until results from broader studies have been reported, but may be useful in high-risk patients in conjunction with genetic counseling.<ref name=ISPD />

A study in 2012 found that the maternal plasma cell-free DNA test was also able to detect Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) in 100% of the cases (59/59) at a false-positive rate of 0.28%, and Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) in 91.7% of the cases (11/12) at a false-positive rate of 0.97%. The test interpreted 99.1% of samples (1,971/1,988); among the 17 samples without an interpretation, three were Trisomy 18. The study stated that if z-score cutoffs for Trisomy 18 and 13 were raised slightly, the overall false-positive rates for the three aneuploidies could be as low as 0.1% (2/1,688) at an overall detection rate of 98.9% (280/283) for common aneuploidies (this includes all three trisomies- Down, Edwards and Patau).<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22281937</ref>

==Typical screening sequence==
California provides a useful guide to most of the currently available screening paradigms.<ref>http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/pns/Documents/Provider%20Handbook%20%202009%20WEB.pdf</ref>

At early presentation of pregnancy at around 6 weeks, early dating ultrasound scan may be offered to help confirm the [[gestational age]] of the embryo and check whether a single or twin pregnancy, but such a scan is unable detect common abnormalities. Details of prenatal screening and testing options may be provided.

Around weeks 10-11, [[nuchal scan|nuchal thickness scan]] (NT) may be offered which can be combined with blood tests for PAPP-A and beta-hCG, two serum markers that correlate with chromosomal abnormalities, in what is called the First Trimester Combined Test.  The results of the blood test are them combined with the NT ultrasound measurements, maternal age, and gestational age of the fetus to yield a risk score for Down Syndrome, Trisomy 18, and Trisomy 13. First Trimester Combined Test has a sensitivity (i.e. detection rate for abnormalities) of 82-87% and a false-positive rate around 5%.

Alternatively, a second trimester Quad blood test may be taken (the triple test is widely considered obsolete but in some states, such as Missouri, where Medicaid only covers the Triple test, that's what the patient typically gets). With ''integrated screening'', both a First Trimester Combined Test and a Triple/Quad test is performed, and a report is only produced after both tests have been analyzed. However patients may not wish to wait between these two sets of test. With ''sequential screening'', a first report is produced after the first trimester sample has been submitted, and a final report after the second sample. With ''contingent screening'', patients at very high or very low risks will get reports after the first trimester sample has been submitted. Only patients with ''moderate risk'' (risk score between 1:50 and 1:2000) will be asked to submit a second trimester sample, after which they will receive a report combining information from both serum samples and the [[nuchal translucency|NT]] measurement. The First Trimester Combined Test and the Triple/Quad test together have a sensitivity of 88-95% with a 5% false-positive rate for Down Syndrome, though they can also be analyzed in such a way as to offer a 90% sensitivity with a 2% false-positive rate.

Finally for patients who do not receive an NT ultrasound in the 1st trimester may still receive a Serum Integrated test involving measuring PAPP-A serum levels in the 1st trimester and then doing a Quad test in the 2nd trimester.  This offers an 85-88% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for Down Syndrome.  Also, patient may skip 1st trimester screening entirely and receive only a 2nd trimester Quad test, with an 81% sensitivity for Down Syndrome and 5% false-positive rate.

==Conditions typically tested for==

===Aneuploidy===
Use of ultrasound for [[nuchal translucency]] will screen for [[aneuploidy]] such as [[Down Syndrome]] (Trisomy 21), Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18), and [[Patau Syndrome]] (Trisomy 13), whilst screens that only use serum markers will screen for Down Syndrome and Trisomy 18, but not Trisomy 13.  Considering that Trisomy 13 is extremely rare, maybe 1:5000 pregnancies and 1:16000 births, this difference is probably not significant. The AFP marker, whether alone or as part of the Quad test, can identify 80% of spina bifida, 85% of abdominal wall defects, and 97% of anencephaly.  Frequently women will receive a detailed 2nd trimester ultrasound in Weeks 18-20 (Morphology scan) regardless of her AFP level, which makes the AFP score unnecessary. Morphology ultrasound scans being undertaken on larger sized fetuses than in earlier scans, detect other structural abnormalities such as cardiac and renal tract abnormalities.

Interphase-[[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH), [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction]], and [[Chorionic villus sampling|direct preparation of chromosomes from chorionic villi]] are all current methods being used that are the most effective for detecting fetal aneuploidy.<ref name=Ref2>{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00001703-200204000-00010|title=Developments in laboratory techniques for prenatal diagnosis|last=Miny|first=P|coauthors=Tercanli S, Holzgreve W|journal=Current Opinions in Obstetrics and Gynecology|year=2002|month=April|volume=14|issue=2|pages=161–8}}</ref>

====Noninvasive techniques for detecting aneuploidy====
Due to the detection of fetal cells and fetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy is becoming more promising.<ref name=Ref2/><ref name="urlFetal Cells from Maternal Blood - A Powerful tool for Prenatal Diagnosis">{{cite web |url=http://newsite.fcmb.dk/index.php/fcmb-publications.html|title=Fetal Cells from Maternal Blood - A Powerful tool for Prenatal Diagnosis}}</ref> The development of a variety of screening methods for fetal aneuploidy and other chromosomal aberrations is now a prominent research area because of the discovery of circulating fetal [[nucleic acid]] in maternal [[blood plasma]]. However, the key problem is that circulating fetal nucleated cells comprise only three to six percent of maternal blood plasma DNA. Therefore, two effective approaches have been developed that can be used for the detection of fetal aneuploidy. The first involves the measuring of the [[allele|allelic ratio]] of [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) in the [[mRNA]] coding region in the [[placenta]]. The next approach is analyzing both maternal and fetal DNA and looking for differences in the [[DNA methylation]] patterns.<ref name=Ref3>{{cite journal|title=Noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies by maternal plasma nucleic acid analysis: a review of the current state of the art|last=Lo|first=YM|journal=BJOG|year=2009|month=January|volume=116|pages=152–7|pmid=19076946|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.02010.x}}</ref> Fetal cell DNA in maternal blood plasma is elevated in pregnancies complicated by fetal [[trisomy]] [[trisomy 21|21]], [[trisomy 13|13]] and [[trisomy 18|18]], making it easier to acquire enough sample sizes of maternal blood plasma to test for fetal aneuploidy.

=====Digital PCR=====
Recently, it has been proposed that digital [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] can used for detection of fetal aneuploidy using fetal DNA and RNA found in maternal blood plasma. Research has shown that digital PCR can be used to differentiate between normal and aneuploid DNA using fetal DNA in the maternal blood plasma.<ref name=Ref4>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pd.2150|title=Digital PCR: a powerful new tool for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis?|last=Zimmermann|first=BG|coauthors=Grill S, Holzgreve W, Zhong XY, Jackson LG, Hahn S|journal=Prenata Diagnostics|year=2008|month=December|volume=28|issue=12|pages=1087–93|pmid=19003785}}</ref>

A variation of the PCR technique called [[multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification]] (MLPA), targeting DNA, has been successively applied for diagnosing fetal aneuploidy as a chromosome- or gene-specific assay.<ref name=Attie2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq054 }}</ref>

=====Shotgun sequencing=====
Fetal cell DNA has been directly sequenced using [[shotgun sequencing]] technology. This DNA was obtained from the blood plasma of eighteen pregnant women. This was followed by mapping the chromosome using the quantification of fragments. This was done using advanced methods in DNA sequencing resulting in the parallel sequencing of the fetal DNA. The amount of sequence tags mapped to each chromosome was counted. If there was a surplus or deficiency in any of the chromosomes, this meant that there was a fetal aneuploid. Using this method of shotgun sequencing, the successful identification of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) was possible. This method of noninvasive diagnosis is now starting to be heavily used and researched further.<ref name=Ref1>{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0808319105|title=Noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy by shotgun sequencing DNA from maternal blood|last=Fan|first=HC|coauthors=Blumenfeld YJ, Chitkara U, Hudgins L, Quake SR|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|location=United States|date= October 21, 2008 |volume=105|issue=42|pages=16266–71|pmid=18838674|pmc=2562413}}</ref>

=====Other techniques=====
Fetal components in samples from maternal blood plasma can be analyzed by genome-wide techniques not only by total DNA, but also by [[methylated DNA]] immunoprecipitation (with tiling array), [[microRNA]] (such as with Megaplex) and total RNA ([[RNA-sequencing]]).<ref name=Attie2011/>

=====Patient acceptance=====
Research was conducted to determine how women felt about noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploid using maternal blood. This study was conducted using surveys. It was reported that eight-two percent of pregnant women and seventy-nine percent of female medical students view this type of diagnosis in a positive light, agreeing that it is important for prenatal care. Overall, women responded optimistically that this form of diagnosis will be available in the future.<ref name=Ref5>{{cite journal|title=The attitude of women toward current and future possibilities of diagnostic testing in maternal blood using fetal DNA|last=Kooij|first=L|coauthors=Tymstra T, Berg P|journal=Prenat Diagn|year=2009|month=February|volume=29|pages=164–8|pmid=19180577|issue=2|doi=10.1002/pd.2205}}</ref>

===Rarer conditions also detected===
In addition to the direct seeking of chromosomal abnormalities and spina bifida, the blood tests can suggest additional conditions:
* Very low estriol level (part of Quad test) can indicate a risk of [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome]] (SLOS), an extremely rare (1:100,000) genetic disorder which can then only be confirmed with an amniocentesis. However with a 0.3% false-positive rate, 300 women would be told they are at high-risk of SLOS for every 1 affected pregnancy.  Most physicians would agree that subjecting 300 women to an amniocentesis to diagnose 1 case of SLOS is not prudent.
* A low PAPP-A reading from a 1st Trimester serum test could also indicate a risk for pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or early fetal demise (i.e. miscarriage).  However, because PAPP-A only weakly correlates with these conditions and, in any case, there's little that one can do about them (except for pre-eclampsia, though that is better identified by other means), a PAPP-A test makes little sense except as a component of Down Syndrome screening.

==Ethical and practical issues==

===Ethical issues of prenatal testing===
* The option to continue or abort a pregnancy is the primary choice after most prenatal testing. Rarely, [[fetal intervention]] corrective procedures are possible.
* Are the risks of prenatal diagnosis, such as [[amniocentesis]] worth the potential benefit?
* Knowing about certain birth defects such as [[spina bifida]] and [[teratoma]] before birth may give the option of [[fetal surgery]] during pregnancy, or assure that the appropriate treatment and/or surgery be provided immediately after birth.
* Questions of the value of mentally or physically disabled people in society.
* How to ensure that information about testing options is given in a non-directive and supportive way.
* That parents are well informed if they have to consider abortion vs. continuing a pregnancy. ''See'' [[wrongful abortion]].

===Will the result of the test affect treatment of the fetus?===
In some genetic conditions, for instance [[cystic fibrosis]], an abnormality can only be detected if DNA is obtained from the fetus. Usually an invasive method is needed to do this.

If a genetic disease is detected, there is often no treatment that can help the fetus until it is born. However in the US, there are prenatal surgeries for [[spina bifida]] fetus. Early diagnosis gives the parents time to research and discuss post-natal treatment and care, or in some cases, abortion.  [[Genetic counselors]] are usually called upon to help families make informed decisions regarding results of prenatal diagnosis.

===False positives and false negatives===
Ultrasound of a fetus, which is considered a screening test, can sometimes miss subtle abnormalities.  For example, studies show that a detailed 2nd trimester ultrasound, also called a level 2 ultrasound, can detect about 97% of neural tube defects such as [[spina bifida]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Ultrasound results may also show "soft signs," such as an [[Echogenic intracardiac focus]] or a [[Choroid plexus cyst]], which are usually normal, but can be associated with an increased risk for [[chromosome]] abnormalities.

Other screening tests, such as the Quad test, can also have false positives and false negatives.  Even when the Quad results are positive (or, to be more precise, when the Quad test yields a score that shows at least a 1 in 270 risk of abnormality), usually the pregnancy is normal, but additional diagnostic tests are offered.  In fact, consider that Down Syndrome affects about 1:400 pregnancies; if you screened 4000 pregnancies with a Quad test, there would probably be 10 Down Syndrome pregnancies of which the Quad test, with its 80% sensitivity, would call 8 of them high-risk.  The quad test would also tell 5% (~200) of the 3990 normal women that they are high-risk.  Therefore, about 208 women would be told they are high-risk, but when they undergo an invasive test, only 8 (or 4% of the high risk pool) will be confirmed as positive and 200 (96%) will be told that their pregnancies are normal.  Since amniocentesis has approximately a 0.5% chance of miscarriage, one of those 200 normal pregnancies might result in a miscarriage because of the invasive procedure.  Meanwhile, of the 3792 women told they are low-risk by the Quad test, 2 of them will go on to deliver a baby with Down Syndrome.  The Quad test is therefore said to have a 4% positive predictive value (PPV) because only 4% of women who are told they are "high-risk" by the screening test actually have an affected fetus.  The other 96% of the women who are told they are "high-risk" needlessly worry until they get the results back from their invasive procedure and find out that their pregnancy is normal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

By comparison, in the same 4000 women, a screening test that has a 99% sensitivity and a 0.5% false positive rate would detect all 10 positives while telling 20 normal women that they are positive.  Therefore, 30 women would undergo a confirmatory invasive procedure and 10 of them (33%) would be confirmed as positive and 20 would be told that they have a normal pregnancy.  Of the 3970 women told by the screen that they are negative, none of the women would have an affected pregnancy.  Therefore, such a screen would have a 33% positive predictive value.  It's still unfortunate that 20 false-positive women have had to undergo an invasive procedure to find out they have a normal pregnancy, but it's still better than 200 false-positives with the Quad test.

The real-world false-positive rate for the Quad test (as well as 1st Trimester Combined, Integrated, etc.) is greater than 5%.  5% was the rate quoted in the large clinical studies that were done by the best researchers and physicians, where all the ultrasounds were done by well-trained sonographers and the gestational age of the fetus was calculated as closely as possible.  In the real world, where calculating gestational age may be a less precise art, the formulas that generate a patient's risk score are not as accurate and the false-positive rate can be higher, even 10%.

Because of the low accuracy of conventional screening tests, 5-10% of women, often those who are older, will opt for an invasive test even if they received a low-risk score from the screening.  A patient who received a 1:330 risk score, while technically low-risk (since the cutoff for high-risk is commonly quoted as 1:270), might be more likely to still opt for a confirmatory invasive test.  On the other hand, a patient who receives a 1:1000 risk score is more likely to feel assuaged that her pregnancy is normal.

Both [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]]s and [[Type I and type II errors|false negative]]s will have a large impact on a couple when they are told the result, or when the child is born.  [[medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] tests, such as amniocentesis, are considered to be very accurate for the defects they check for, though even these tests are not perfect, with a reported 0.2% error rate (often due to rare abnormalities such as mosaic Down Syndrome where only some of the fetal/placental cells carry the genetic abnormality).

A higher [[Alpha-fetoprotein|maternal serum AFP]] level indicates a greater risk for anencephaly and open spina bifida.  This screening is 80% and 90% sensitive for spina bifida and anencephaly, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Amniotic fluid [[acetylcholinesterase]] and [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]] level are more [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] and [[specific]] than AFP in predicting neural tube defects.

Many maternal-fetal specialists do not bother to even do an AFP test on their patients because they do a detail ultrasound on all of them in the 2nd trimester, which has a 97% detection rate for neural tube defects such as anencephaly and open spina bifida.

No prenatal test can detect ''all'' forms of birth defects and abnormalities.

===Societal Pressures on Prenatal Testing Decisions===
Amniocentesis has become the standard of care for prenatal care visits for women who are "at risk" or over a certain age.  Most obstetricians (depending on the country) offer patients the AFP [[triple test]], [[HIV]] test, and ultrasounds routinely.  However, almost all women meet with a [[genetic counselor]] before deciding whether to have prenatal diagnosis.  It is the role of the genetic counselor to accurately inform women of the risks and benefits of prenatal diagnosis. Genetic counselors are trained to be non-directive and to support the patient's decision. Some doctors do advise women to have certain prenatal tests and the patient's partner may also influence the woman's decision.

===Informed consent and medical malpractice===
{{Globalize/US|section|date=December 2010}}
Obstetricians have an ethical duty to properly inform patients of their options, specifically the availability of screening and diagnostic testing.  Physicians have been successfully sued by women who gave birth to babies with abnormalities that could have been detected had they known about their screening options, though the plaintiff must also prove that she would have elected to terminate the pregnancy in the event of a positive finding.  Also, physicians who fail to inform their patients of the risks of amniocentesis and CVS might be found guilty of negligence informed consent in the event that the patient sues after a procedure-related miscarriage or fetal damage.

There is a misconception that a physician only needs to do what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care).  However, in the case of informed consent, the legal standard is more commonly defined as what a reasonable patient would elect to do if she is informed.  So if a reasonable patient would want to be screened if only she is informed or if a reasonable patient would want to receive an amniocentesis if only she is informed of that option, then a physician is legally obligated to inform the patient of these options.

As newer, more accurate screening tests emerge, physicians may need to quickly get up to speed on the most recent data and start informing their patients of the existence of these tests.  Failure to inform patients of the available of these more accurate screening tests might result in a wrongful birth or wrongful miscarriage lawsuit if the patient can demonstrate that she would have chosen the newer test, if she had known about it, to avoid the unfortunate outcome that resulted from receiving a conventional screening test or invasive procedure.
