The '''nucleus accumbens''' (NAcc), also known as the '''accumbens nucleus''' or as the '''nucleus accumbens septi''' (Latin for ''[[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nucleus]] leaning against the [[septum]]'') or as part of [[the pleasure center]], is a collection of [[neuron]]s and forms the main part of the [[ventral striatum]]. It is thought to play an important role in [[Reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], [[laughter]], [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], [[aggression]], [[fear]], and the [[placebo effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schwienbacher I, Fendt M, Richardson R, Schnitzler HU |title=Temporary inactivation of the nucleus accumbens disrupts acquisition and expression of fear-potentiated startle in rats |journal=Brain Res. |volume=1027 |issue=1–2 |pages=87–93 |year=2004 |pmid=15494160 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2004.08.037}}</ref><ref>[http://www.brightsurf.com/news/headlines/31647/Brain_region_central_to_placebo_effect_identified.html The Placebo Effect in the NAC]</ref><ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/94023.php ''Dopamine Involved In Aggression - Medical News Today'']</ref>

Each half of the brain has one nucleus accumbens. It is located where the head of the [[caudate nucleus|caudate]] and the anterior portion of the [[putamen]] meet just lateral to the [[septum pellucidum]].
The nucleus accumbens and the [[olfactory tubercle]] collectively form the [[ventral striatum]], which is part of the [[basal ganglia]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2007/MB_cgi?mode=&term=Nucleus+Accumbens Nucleus Accumbens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The nucleus accumbens can be divided into two structures—the [[nucleus accumbens core]] and the [[nucleus accumbens shell]].  These structures have different morphology and function.

==Cell types==
The principal neuronal cell type found in the nucleus accumbens is the [[medium spiny neuron]]. The [[neurotransmitter]] produced by these neurons is [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), one of the main inhibitory neurotransmitters of the central nervous system. These neurons are also the main projection or output neurons of the nucleus accumbens.

While 95% of the neurons in the nucleus accumbens are medium spiny GABA-ergic projection neurons, other neuronal types are also found such as large aspiny [[cholinergic]] [[interneuron]]s.

==Output and input==
===Output===
The output neurons of the nucleus accumbens send axon projections to the ventral analog of the [[globus pallidus]], known as the ventral pallidum (VP). The VP, in turn, projects to the [[medial dorsal nucleus]] of the dorsal [[thalamus]], which projects to the [[prefrontal cortex]] as well as the [[striatum]]. Other efferents from the nucleus accumbens include connections with the [[substantia nigra]] and the [[pontine reticular formation]].

===Input===
Major inputs to the nucleus accumbens include prefrontal association cortices, basolateral [[amygdala]], and dopaminergic neurons located in the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), which connect via the [[mesolimbic pathway]]. Thus the nucleus accumbens is often described as one part of a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop.

Dopaminergic input from the VTA is thought to modulate the activity of neurons within the nucleus accumbens. These terminals are also the site of action of highly-addictive [[recreational drug use|drugs]] such as [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamine]], which cause a manifold increase in [[dopamine]] levels in the nucleus accumbens. 

Another major source of input comes from the CA1 and ventral subiculum of the hippocampus to the dorsomedial area of the Nucleus accumbens. The neurons of the hippocampus have a noteworthy correlation to slight depolarizations of cells in the nucleus accumbens, which makes them more positive and therefore more excitable. The correlated cells of these excited states of the medium spiny neurons in the Nucleus accumbens are shared equally between the subiculum and CA1. The subiculum neurons are found to hyperpolarize (increase negativity) while the CA1 neurons "ripple" (fire > 50 Hz) in order to accomplish this priming. <ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Donnell, P., Goto, Y. |title=Synchronous activity in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens in vivo |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=RC131 |year=2001 |pmid=11160416}}</ref>

==Research==
In the 1950s, [[James Olds]] and Peter Milner implanted electrodes into the septal area of the rat and found that the rat chose to press a lever which stimulated it. It continued to prefer this even over stopping to eat or drink.  This suggests that the area is the "pleasure center" of the brain. The [[septal nuclei]] are not directly connected to the nucleus accumbens, however.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olds J, Milner P |title=Positive reinforcement produced by electrical stimulation of septal area and other regions of rat brain |journal=J Comp Physiol Psychol |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=419–27 |year=1954 |pmid=13233369 |doi=10.1037/h0058775}} [http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/0155060678_rathus/ps/ps02.html article]</ref>

Although the nucleus accumbens has traditionally been studied for its role in addiction, it plays an equal role in processing many rewards such as food and sex. The nucleus accumbens is selectively activated during the perception of pleasant, emotionally arousing pictures and during mental imagery of pleasant, emotional scenes.<ref name=Costa>{{cite journal |author=Costa, VD, Lang, PJ, Sabatinelli, D, Bradley MM, and Versace, F |title=Emotional imagery: Assessing pleasure and arousal in the brain's reward circuitry |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=31 |pages=1446–1457 |year=2010 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20948 |pmid=20127869 |issue=9}}</ref><ref name=Sabatinelli>{{cite journal |author=Sabatinelli, D, Lang, PJ, Bradley, MM, Costa, VD, and Versace, F |title=Pleasure rather than salience activates human nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=98 |pages=1374–1379 |year=2007 |doi=10.1152/jn.00230.2007 |pmid=17596422 |issue=9}}</ref> A 2005 study found that it is involved in the regulation of emotions induced by [[music]],<ref name=Menon>Menon, Vinod & Levitin, Daniel J. (2005) ''The rewards of music listening: Response and physiological connectivity of themesolimbic system."  NeuroImage 28(1), pp. 175-184</ref> perhaps consequent to its role in mediating dopamine release.  The nucleus accumbens plays a role in [[Cognitive_neuroscience_of_music|rhythmic timing]] and is considered to be of central importance to the limbic-motor interface (Mogensen).

In April 2007, two research teams reported on having inserted electrodes into the nucleus accumbens in order to use [[deep brain stimulation]] to treat severe [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/18590/ Brain Electrodes Help Treat Depression], ''[[Technology Review]]'', 26 April 2007</ref>

In addition, in July 2007, researcher Jon-Kar Zubieta published findings that the nucleus accumbens is central to the machinery of the [[placebo effect]]. His group has confirmed that specific neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems respond to the expectation of benefit during placebo administration and that these expectations induce measurable physiological changes.<ref>http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-07/cp-brc071607.php Brain region central to placebo effect identified</ref>

The nucleus accumbens has been targeted by [[stereotactic surgery]] for ablation as a treatment in [[China]] for [[alcoholism]].<ref>Wu HM, Wang XL, Chang CW, Li N, Gao L, Geng N, Ma JH, Zhao W, Gao GD. (2010). Preliminary findings in ablating the nucleus accumbens using stereotactic surgery for alleviating psychological dependence on alcohol.
