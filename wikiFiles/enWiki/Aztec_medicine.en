'''Aztec medicine''' concerns the body of knowledge, belief and ritual surrounding human health and sickness, as observed among the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking peoples in the [[Aztec]] realm of central Mexico during the pre- and post-[[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest eras]]. A variety of indigenous [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] and [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Novohispanic]] written works survive from the conquest and later colonial periods that describe aspects of the Aztec system and practice of [[medicine]] and its remedies, incantations, practical administration, and cultural underpinnings. Elements of traditional medicinal practices and beliefs are still found among modern-day Nahua communities, often intermixed with European or other later influences.

As with many other [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, the Aztec system recognised three main causes of illness and injuries—supernatural causes involving the displeasure of the gods or excess and imbalance with the supernatural and natural worlds, magical causes involving malevolent curses and [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] (a ''tlacatecolotl'' in Nahuatl), and natural or practical causes. Establishing a treatment for any given ailment depended first upon determining the nature of its cause.

Disease had an ambivalent or dualistic aspect, representing an imbalanced state but at the same time its presence could indicate the existence of a communion with the supernatural world.

The Aztecs knew of and used an extensive inventory consisting of hundreds of different [[medicinal herb]]s and plants.
