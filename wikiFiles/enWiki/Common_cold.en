<!-- Symptoms and cause -->
The '''common cold''' (also known as '''nasopharyngitis''', '''rhinopharyngitis''', '''acute coryza''', or '''a cold''') is a viral [[infectious disease]] of the [[upper respiratory tract]] which affects primarily the nose. Symptoms include [[cough]]ing, [[sore throat]], [[rhinorrhea|runny nose]], [[Sneeze|sneezing]], and [[fever]] which usually resolve in seven to ten days, with some symptoms lasting up to three weeks. Well over 200 viruses are implicated in the cause of the common cold; the [[rhinovirus]]es are the most common.

<!-- Prevention, diagnosis and pathophysiology -->
[[Upper respiratory tract infection]]s are loosely divided by the areas they affect, with the common cold primarily affecting the nose, the throat ([[pharyngitis]]), and the sinuses ([[sinusitis]]), occasionally involving either or both eyes via [[conjunctivitis]]. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's [[immune]] response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The primary method of prevention is by [[hand washing]] with some evidence to support the effectiveness of wearing  face masks.

<!-- Treatment, epidemiology, history -->
No cure for the common cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans with the average adult contracting two to three colds a year and the average child contracting between six and twelve. These infections have been with humanity since antiquity.

==Signs and symptoms==

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Illu conducting passages.svg|thumb|The common cold is a disease of the [[upper respiratory tract]].]]
The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the [[immune]] response to the virus.<ref name=E112>Eccles Pg. 112</ref> The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus  is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human [[ICAM-1|ICAM-1 receptors]] through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of [[inflammatory mediators]].<ref name=E112/> These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms.<ref name=E112/> It does not generally cause damage to the nasal [[epithelium]].<ref name=Eccles2005/> The respiratory syncytial virus ([[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]]) on the other hand is contracted by both direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the [[lower respiratory tract]].<ref name=E116>Eccles Pg.116</ref> RSV does cause epithelium damage.<ref name=E116/> Human [[parainfluenza]] virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and [[bronchus|bronchi]].<ref name=E122>Eccles Pg.122</ref> In young children when it affects the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] it may produce the symptoms of [[croup]] due to the small size of their airway.<ref name=E122/>

==Diagnosis==
The distinction between different viral [[upper respiratory tract infections]] is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, [[pharyngitis]] the throat, and [[bronchitis]] the lungs.<ref name=CE11/> There however can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected.<ref name=CE11/> The common cold is frequently defined as [[rhinitis|nasal inflammation]] with varying amount of throat inflammation.<ref name=E51>Eccles Pg. 51–52</ref> Self-diagnosis is frequent.<ref name=Eccles2005/> Isolation of the actual viral agent involved is rarely performed,<ref name=E51/> and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.<ref name=Eccles2005/>

==Prevention==
The only possibly useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures<ref name=E209>Eccles Pg.209</ref> such as [[hand washing]] and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used.<ref name=E209/> Isolation, e.g. [[quarantine]], is not possible as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. [[Vaccination]] has proved difficult as there are so many viruses involved and they [[Viral evolution|mutate]] rapidly.<ref name=E209/> Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is thus highly improbable.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lawrence DM | title = Gene studies shed light on rhinovirus diversity | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages =  278| year = 2009 | month = May | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70123-9 }}</ref>

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children.<ref name=CochP11>{{cite journal | author = Jefferson T, Del Mar CB, Dooley L, Ferroni E, Al-Ansary LA, Bawazeer GA, van Driel ML, Nair S, Jones MA, Thorning S, Conly JM | title = Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 7 | pages =  CD006207| year = 2011 | month = July | pmid = 21735402 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub4 | editor1-last = Jefferson | editor1-first = Tom }}</ref> Whether the addition of [[antiviral drug|antivirals]] or [[antibacterial]]s to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown.<ref name=CochP11/> Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater [[social distance]].<ref name=CochP11/> [[Zinc#Biological role|Zinc]] supplements may help to reduce the prevalence of colds.<ref name=Zinc11>{{cite journal | author = Singh M, Das RR | title = Zinc for the common cold | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 2 | pages =  CD001364| year = 2011 | month = February | pmid = 21328251 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001364.pub3 | editor1-last = Singh | editor1-first = Meenu }}</ref>  Routine [[vitamin C]] supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though it may reduce its duration.<ref name="Hemilä2010"/>

==Management==
[[Image:Pneumonia strikes like a man eating shark.jpg|thumb|Poster encouraging citizens to "Consult your Physician" for treatment of the common cold]]
There are currently no medications or herbal remedies  which have been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.<ref>{{cite web| title = Common Cold: Treatments and Drugs| publisher = Mayo Clinic| url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/common-cold/DS00056/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs| accessdate = 9 January 2010}}</ref> Treatment thus comprises symptomatic relief.<ref name=AFP07/> Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and [[gargling]] with warm salt water, are reasonable conservative measures.<ref name="NIAID2006"/> Much of the benefit from treatment is however attributed to the [[placebo effect]].<ref>Eccles Pg.261</ref>

==Prognosis==
The common cold is generally mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week.<ref name=CE11/> Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young or those who are [[immunosuppressed]].<ref name=E1/> Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in [[sinusitis]], [[pharyngitis]], or an [[acute otitis media|ear infection]].<ref>Eccles Pg.76</ref> It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and an ear infection in 30% of cases.<ref name="EcclesPg_a">Eccles Pg.90</ref>

Native Americans and [[Eskimo]]s are more likely to be infected with colds and develop complications such as [[otitis media]] than Caucasians.<ref name=Medscape/> This may be explained by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity.<ref name=Medscape/>

==History==
While the cause of the common cold has only been identified since the 1950s the disease has been with humanity since antiquity.<ref>Eccles Pg. 3</ref> Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian [[Ebers papyrus]], the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE.<ref>Eccles Pg.6</ref> The name "common cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cold | title=Cold | accessdate=12 January 2008 }}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the [[Common Cold Unit]] was set up by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in 1946 and it was here that the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956.<ref>Eccles Pg.20</ref> In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with [[interferon]] during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease,<ref name="pmid2438740">{{cite journal | author = Tyrrell DA | title = Interferons and their clinical value | journal = Rev.

The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of [[Zinc gluconate#Zinc and the common cold|zinc gluconate lozenges]] in the [[prophylaxis]] and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Al-Nakib W | title = Prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds with zinc gluconate lozenges | journal = J Antimicrob Chemother. | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 893–901 | year = 1987 | month = December | pmid = 3440773 | doi = 10.1093/jac/20.6.893 | last2 = Higgins | first2 = P.G. | last3 = Barrow | first3 = I. | last4 = Batstone | first4 = G. | last5 = Tyrrell | first5 = D.A.J. }}</ref>

The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world.<ref name="EcclesPg_a" /> In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptomatic relief.<ref name=Frend03>{{cite journal | author = Fendrick AM, Monto AS, Nightengale B, Sarnes M | title = The economic burden of non-influenza-related viral respiratory tract infection in the United States | journal = Arch.

As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year.<ref name="NIAID2006"/><ref name=Frend03/>  This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kirkpatrick GL | title = The common cold | journal = Prim.

==Research directions==
A number of antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; however as of 2009 none have been both found effective and licensed for use.<ref name="EcclesPg_b" /> There are ongoing trials of the anti-viral drug [[pleconaril]] which shows promise against [[picornavirus]]es as well as trials of BTA-798.<ref name=E226>Eccles Pg.226</ref> The oral form of pleconaril had  safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied.<ref name=E226/>
