'''Insulin resistance''' (IR) is a [[physiological]] condition in which cells fail to respond to the normal actions of the hormone [[insulin]]. The body produces insulin, but the cells in the body become resistant to insulin (through changes in their surface receptors) and are unable to use it as effectively.  Beta cells in the Pancreas increase their production of insulin, further contributing to hyperglycemia.  This often remains undetected and can contribute to a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes.

==Explanation==
One of insulin's various jobs is to regulate delivery of glucose into cells to provide them with energy.<ref>{{cite web|last=The Economist|title=A heavy burden|url=http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21568073-obesity-presents-big-challenge-governments-and-opportunity-drug-companies|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>   Insulin resistant cells are not able to take in glucose, amino acids and fatty acids.  Thus, glucose, fatty acids and amino acids 'leak' out of the cells.  A decrease in insulin/glucagon ratio inhibits glycolysis which in turn decreases energy production. The resulting increase in blood glucose may raise levels outside the normal range and cause adverse health effects, depending on dietary conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Insulin resistance|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/insulin_resistance/article.htm}}</ref>  Certain cell types such as [[fat]] and [[muscle]] cells require insulin to absorb glucose. When these cells fail to respond adequately to circulating insulin, blood glucose levels rise. The [[liver]] helps regulate glucose levels by reducing its secretion of glucose in the presence of insulin. This normal reduction in the liver’s glucose production may not occur in people with insulin resistance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090621143236.htm |title=www.sciencedaily.com |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Insulin resistance in muscle and fat cells reduces [[glucose]] uptake (and also local storage of glucose as [[glycogen]] and [[triglycerides]], respectively), whereas insulin resistance in liver cells results in reduced glycogen synthesis and storage and a failure to suppress glucose production and release into the blood. Insulin resistance normally refers to reduced glucose-lowering effects of insulin. However, other functions of insulin can also be affected. For example, insulin resistance in [[adipose tissue|fat cells]] reduces the normal effects of insulin on lipids and results in reduced uptake of circulating lipids and increased [[hydrolysis]] of stored [[triglyceride]]s. Increased mobilization of stored lipids in these cells elevates free [[fatty acid]]s in the [[blood plasma]]. Elevated blood fatty-acid concentrations (associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus Type 2), reduced muscle glucose uptake, and increased liver glucose production all contribute to elevated blood glucose levels. High plasma levels of insulin and glucose due to insulin resistance are a major component of the [[metabolic syndrome]]. If insulin resistance exists, more insulin needs to be secreted by the pancreas. If this compensatory increase does not occur, blood glucose concentrations increase and  [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] occurs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/insulin_resistance/article.htm |title=www.medicinenet.com |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Original research|section|discuss=Talk:Insulin resistance#Original research in symptoms list|date=October 2010}}
These depend on poorly understood variations in individual biology and consequently may not be found with all people diagnosed with insulin resistance.

# Brain fogginess and inability to focus.
# High blood sugar.
# Intestinal bloating – most intestinal gas is produced from carbohydrates in the diet, mostly those that humans cannot digest and absorb.
# Sleepiness, especially after meals.
# Weight gain, fat storage, difficulty losing weight – for most people, excess weight is from high fat storage; the fat in IR is generally stored in and around abdominal organs in both males and females. It is currently suspected that hormones produced in that fat are a precipitating cause of insulin resistance.
# Increased blood triglyceride levels.
# Increased blood pressure. Many people with hypertension are either diabetic or pre-diabetic and have elevated insulin levels due to insulin resistance. One of insulin's effects is to control arterial wall tension throughout the body.
# Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with cardiovascular disease.
# Depression. Due to the deranged metabolism resulting from insulin resistance, psychological effects, including depression, are not uncommon.
# [[Acanthosis nigricans]].
#Increased hunger.

==Causes==
===Diet===

It is well known that insulin resistance commonly coexists with [[obesity]]. However, causal links between insulin resistance, obesity, and dietary factors are complex and controversial. It is possible that one of them arises first, and tends to cause the other; or that insulin resistance and excess body weight might arise independently as a consequence of a third factor, but end up reinforcing each other. Some population groups might be genetically predisposed to one or the other.

Dietary fat has long been implicated as a driver of insulin resistance. Studies on animals observed significant insulin resistance in rats after just 3 weeks on a high-fat diet (59% fat, 20% carb.).<ref>{{cite journal|author= E W Kraegen|year=1991|journal=Diabetes|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/40/11/1397.short|title=Development of muscle insulin resistance after liver insulin resistance in high-fat-fed rats|pmid= 1936601|doi= 10.2337/diabetes.40.11.1397|volume= 40|issue= 11|pages= 1397–1403|author-separator= ,|display-authors= 1|last2= Clark|first2= P.

In humans, statistical evidence is more equivocal. Being insensitive to insulin is still positively correlated with fat intake, and negatively correlated with dietary fiber intake <ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/55/6/1174.abstract|title=Habitual dietary intake and insulin sensitivity in lean and obese adults|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=1992|author=J Lovejoy and M DiGirolamo|pmid=1317665|volume=55|issue=6|pages=1174–9}}</ref>, but both these factors are also correlated with excess body weight.

Several recent authors suggested that the intake of simple sugars, and particularly [[fructose]], is also a factor that contributes to insulin resistance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html?pagewanted=6&_r=1|title=Is sugar toxic?|author=Gary Taubes | work=The New York Times|date=April 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/5|title=Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslipidemia|author=Heather Basciano, Lisa Federico and Khosrow Adeli|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-2-5|year=2005|journal=Nutrition & Metabolism|volume=2|pages=5|issue=1|pmid=15723702|pmc=552336}}</ref> Fructose is metabolized by the liver into triglycerides, and, as mentioned above, tends to raise their levels in the blood stream.

Yet another proposed mechanism involves the phenomenon known as [[leptin]] resistance. Leptin is a hormone that regulates long-term energy balance in many mammals. An important role of leptin is long-term inhibition of appetite in response to formation of body fat. This mechanism is known to be disrupted in many obese individuals: even though their leptin levels are commonly elevated, this does not result in reduction of appetite and caloric intake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leptinresearch.org/pdf/rsh_leptin_resistance_and_obesity.pdf|title=Leptin Resistance and Obesity}}</ref> Leptin resistance can be triggered in rats by ad libitum consumption of energy-dense, highly palatable foods over a period of several days.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/12/2786.full|pmid=11723062|doi=10.2337/diabetes.50.12.2786|year=2001|last1=Wang|first1=J|last2=Obici|first2=S|last3=Morgan|first3=K|last4=Barzilai|first4=N|last5=Feng|first5=Z|last6=Rossetti|first6=L|title=Overfeeding rapidly induces leptin and insulin resistance|volume=50|issue=12|pages=2786–2791|journal=Diabetes}}</ref> Chronic consumption of fructose in rats ultimately results in leptin resistance (however, this has only been demonstrated in a diet where fructose provided 60% of calories;<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/295/5/R1370.full|title=Fructose-induced leptin resistance exacerbates weight gain in response to subsequent high-fat feeding|author=Alexandra Shapiro|journal=American Journal of Physiology|year=2008|pmid=18703413|doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00195.2008|volume=295|issue=5|pages=R1370–R1375|pmc=2584858|author-separator=,|display-authors=1|last2=Mu|first2=W.|last3=Roncal|first3=C.|last4=Cheng|first4=K.-Y.|last5=Johnson|first5=R.

Once leptin signalling has been disrupted, the individual becomes prone to further overeating, weight gain, and insulin resistance.

As elevated blood glucose levels are the primary stimulus for insulin secretion and production, habitually excessive carbohydrate intake is another likely contributor. This serves as a major motivation behind the [[low-carb]] family of diets. Furthermore, carbohydrates are not equally absorbed (for example, the blood glucose level response to a fixed quantity of carbohydrates in baked [[potato]]es is about twice the response to the same quantity of carbohydrates in [[pumpernickel]] bread). Integrated blood glucose response to a fixed quantity of carbohydrates in a meal is known as [[glycemic index]]. Some diets are based on this concept, assuming that consumption of low-GI foods is less likely to result in insulin resistance and obesity. However, small to moderate amounts of simple sugars (i.e., sucrose, fructose, and glucose) in the typical developed-world diet seem to not have a causative effect on the development of insulin resistance <ref name=pmid12663565>{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/diacare.26.4.1008 |last1=Janket |first1=SJ |last2=Manson |first2=JE |last3=Sesso |first3=H |last4=Buring |first4=JE |last5=Liu |first5=S |title=A prospective study of sugar intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in women |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=1008–1015 |year=2003 |pmid=12663565}}</ref>.

Once established, insulin resistance would result in increased circulating levels of insulin. Since insulin is the primary hormonal signal for energy storage into [[fat cells]], which tend to retain their sensitivity in the face of hepatic and skeletal muscle resistance, IR stimulates the formation of new fatty tissue and accelerates weight gain.<ref name="fast_food">{{cite journal|url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/12/2451|title=Fast Food, Central Nervous System Insulin Resistance, and Obesity|journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology|year=2005|author=Elvira Isganaitis; Robert H.

Another possible explanation is that both insulin resistance and obesity often have the same cause, a systematic overeating, which has the potential to lead to insulin resistance and obesity due to repeated administration of excess levels of glucose, which stimulate insulin secretion; excess levels of fructose, which raise triglyceride levels in the bloodstream; and fats, which can be easily absorbed by the [[adipose cells]] and tend to end up as fatty tissue in a hypercaloric diet. Some scholars go as far as to claim that neither insulin resistance, nor obesity are really metabolic disorders ''per se'', but simply adaptive responses to sustained caloric surplus, intended to protect bodily organs from lipotoxicity (unsafe levels of lipids in the bloodstream and tissues): "Obesity should therefore not be regarded as a pathology or disease, but rather as the normal, physiologic response to sustained caloric surplus ... As a consequence of the high level of lipid accumulation in insulin target tissues including skeletal muscle and liver, it has been suggested that exclusion of glucose from lipid-laden cells is a compensatory defense against further accumulation of lipogenic substrate." <ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/hhns/grad/courses/HHNS6700F10WeeklyReadings/UngerandScherer.pdf|title=Gluttony, sloth and the metabolic syndrome: a roadmap to lipotoxicity|author=Roger H.

Rare type 2 diabetes cases sometimes use high levels of exogenous insulin. As short term overdosing of insulin causes short term insulin resistance, it has been hypothesized that chronic high dosing contributes to more permanent insulin resistance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Molecular===
Insulin resistance has been proposed at a molecular level to be a reaction to excess nutrition by [[superoxide dismutase]] in cell [[mitochondria]] that acts as an antioxidant defense mechanism. This link seems to exist under diverse causes of insulin resistance. It is also based on the finding that insulin resistance can be rapidly reversed by exposing cells to [[Uncoupling protein|mitochondrial uncoupler]]s, [[electron transport chain]] inhibitors, or mitochondrial superoxide dismutase mimetics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoehn |first1=KL |last2=Salmon |first2=AB |last3=Hohnen-Behrens |first3=C |last4=Turner |first4=N |last5=Hoy |first5=AJ |last6=Maghzal |first6=GJ |last7=Stocker |first7=R |last8=Van Remmen |first8=H |last9=Kraegen |first9=EW |title=Insulin resistance is a cellular antioxidant defense mechanism |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=106 |issue=42 |pages=17787–17792 |year=2009 |pmid=19805130 |pmc=2764908 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0902380106}}</ref>

===Disease===
Recent research and experimentation has uncovered a non-obesity related connection to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. It has long been observed that patients who have had some kinds of [[bariatric surgery]] have increased insulin sensitivity and even remission of type 2 diabetes. It was discovered that diabetic / insulin resistant non obese rats whose [[duodenum]] has been surgically removed also experienced increased insulin sensitivity and remission of type 2 diabetes. This suggested similar surgery in humans, and early reports in prominent medical journals (January 8) are that the same effect is seen in humans, at least the small number who have participated in the experimental surgical program. The speculation is that some substance is produced in that portion of the small intestine that signals body cells to become insulin resistant. If the producing tissue is removed, the signal ceases and body cells revert to normal insulin sensitivity. No such substance has been found as yet, so its existence remains speculative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Pathophysiology==
Any food or drink containing glucose (or the digestible carbohydrates that contain it, such as [[sucrose]], [[starch]], etc.) causes [[blood glucose level]]s to increase. In a normal metabolism, the elevated blood glucose level makes beta (β) cells in the [[Islets of Langerhans]], located in the [[pancreas]], release insulin into the blood. The insulin, in turn, makes insulin-sensitive tissues in the body (primarily skeletal [[muscle]] cells, [[adipose]] tissue, and [[liver]]) absorb [[glucose]], and thereby lower the blood glucose level. The beta cells reduce insulin output as the blood glucose level falls, allowing blood glucose to settle at a constant of approximately 5&nbsp;[[Reference ranges for blood tests|mmol/L]] (mM) (90&nbsp;mg/dL). In an ''insulin-resistant'' person, normal levels of insulin do not have the same effect in controlling blood glucose levels. During the compensated phase on insulin resistance insulin levels are higher, and blood glucose levels are still maintained. If compensatory insulin secretion fails, then either fasting (impaired fasting glucose) or postprandial (impaired glucose tolerance) glucose concentrations increase. Eventually, type 2 diabetes occurs when glucose levels become higher throughout the day as the resistance increases and compensatory insulin secretion fails. The elevated insulin levels have additional effects (see [[insulin]]) that cause further abnormal biological effects throughout the body.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The most common type of [[insulin]] resistance is associated with overweight and obesity in a condition known as [[metabolic syndrome]]. Insulin resistance often progresses to full [[T2DM|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]] (T2DM). This is often seen when [[hyperglycemia]] develops after a meal, when pancreatic β-cells are unable to produce sufficient insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels ([[euglycemia]]) in the face of insulin resistance. The inability of the β-cells to produce sufficient insulin in a condition of hyperglycemia is what characterizes the transition from insulin resistance to [[T2DM|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]].<ref name = McGarry_2002>{{cite journal |last1=McGarry |first1=JD |title=Banting lecture 2001: dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism in the etiology of type 2 diabetes |journal=Diabetes |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=7–18 |year=2002 |pmid=11756317 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.51.1.7}}</ref>

Various disease states make body tissues more resistant to the actions of insulin. Examples include [[infection]] (mediated by the cytokine [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNFα]]) and [[acidosis]].

Certain drugs may also be associated with insulin resistance (e.g., [[glucocorticoid]]s).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Insulin itself leads to a kind of insulin resistance; every time a cell is exposed to insulin, the production of [[GLUT4]] (type four glucose receptors) on the cell's membrane decreases somewhat.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.2.512 |last1=Flores-Riveros |first1=JR |last2=McLenithan |first2=JC |last3=Ezaki |first3=O |last4=Lane |first4=MD |title=Insulin down-regulates expression of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) gene: effects on transcription and mRNA turnover |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=512–516 |year=1993 |pmid=8421683 |pmc=45693}}</ref> In the presence of a higher than usual level of insulin (generally caused by insulin resistance), this down-regulation acts as a kind of positive feedback, increasing the need for insulin.

Insulin resistance is often found in people with visceral adiposity (i.e., a high degree of fatty tissue within the abdomen – as distinct from subcutaneous adiposity or fat between the skin and the muscle wall, especially elsewhere on the body, such as hips or thighs), hypertension, hyperglycemia and [[dyslipidemia]] involving elevated triglycerides, small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles, and decreased HDL cholesterol levels. With respect to visceral adiposity, a great deal of evidence suggests two strong links with insulin resistance. First, unlike subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose cells produce significant amounts of proinflammatory [[cytokines]] such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha ([[TNF-a]]), and [[Interleukins]]-1 and -6, etc. In numerous experimental models, these proinflammatory cytokines disrupt normal insulin action in fat and muscle cells, and may be a major factor in causing the whole-body insulin resistance observed in patients with visceral adiposity. Much of the attention on production of proinflammatory cytokines has focused on the IKK-beta/[[NF-kappa-B]] pathway, a protein network that enhances transcription of inflammatory markers and mediators that can cause insulin resistance.  Second, visceral adiposity is related to an accumulation of fat in the liver, a condition known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The result of NAFLD is an excessive release of free fatty acids into the bloodstream (due to increased lipolysis), and an increase in hepatic glycogenolysis and hepatic glucose production, both of which have the effect of exacerbating peripheral insulin resistance and increasing the likelihood of [[T2DM|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Insulin resistance is also often associated with a [[hypercoagulable state]] (impaired [[fibrinolysis]]) and increased inflammatory cytokine levels.<ref name="nagaev">{{cite journal|author=[[Ivan Nagaev|Nagaev I]], [[Maria Bokarewa|Bokarewa M]], [[Andrej Tarkowski|Tarkowski A]], [[Ulf Smith|Smith U]]|year=2006|title=Human resistin is a systemic immune-derived proinflammatory cytokine targeting both leukocytes and adipocytes|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=1|issue=1|page=e31|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000031|editor1-last=Valcarcel|editor1-first=Juan|pmid=17183659|pmc=1762367}}</ref>

Insulin resistance is also occasionally found in patients who use insulin. In this case, the production of antibodies against insulin leads to lower-than-expected glucose level reductions (glycemia) after a specific dose of insulin. With the development of human insulin and analogues in the 1980s and the decline in the use of animal insulins (e.g., pork, beef), this type of insulin resistance has become less common. This form of insulin resistance is not what is being referred to in the metabolic syndrome.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[Magnesium]] (Mg) is present in living cells and its plasma concentration is remarkably constant in healthy subjects. Plasma and intracellular Mg concentrations are tightly regulated. Among the controlling mechanisms, insulin seems to be one of the most important. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that insulin may modulate the shift of Mg from extracellular to intracellular space. Intracellular Mg concentration has also been shown to be effective in modulating insulin action (mainly oxidative glucose metabolism), offset calcium-related excitation-contraction coupling, and decrease smooth cell responsiveness to depolarizing stimuli. Poor intracellular Mg concentrations, as found in [[T2DM|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]] and in hypertensive patients, may result in a defective tyrosine-kinase activity at the insulin receptor level and exaggerated intracellular calcium concentration. Both events are responsible for impairment in insulin action, and a worsening of insulin resistance in noninsulin-dependent diabetic and hypertensive patients. By contrast, in [[T2DM]] patients daily Mg administration, restoring a more appropriate intracellular Mg concentration, contributes to improve insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The benefits deriving- from daily Mg supplementation in [[T2DM]] patients are further supported by epidemiological studies showing that high daily Mg intake are predictive of a lower incidence of [[T2DM]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

After 2 hours a [[glycemia]] less than 7.8&nbsp;mmol/L (140&nbsp;mg/dl) is considered normal, a glycemia of between 7.8 to 11.0&nbsp;mmol/L (140 to 197&nbsp;mg/dl) is considered as [[impaired glucose tolerance]] (IGT)  and a glycemia of greater than or equal to 11.1&nbsp;mmol/L (200&nbsp;mg/dl) is considered [[diabetes mellitus]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

An [[oral glucose tolerance test]] (OGTT) can be normal or mildly abnormal in simple insulin resistance. Often, there are raised glucose levels in the early measurements, reflecting the loss of a postprandial (after the meal) peak in insulin production. Extension of the testing (for several more hours) may reveal a [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] "dip," which is a result of an overshoot in insulin production after the failure of the physiologic postprandial insulin response.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Measuring insulin resistance===
;Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
The [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for investigating and quantifying insulin resistance is the "hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp," so-called because it measures the amount of [[glucose]] necessary to compensate for an increased [[insulin]] level without causing [[hypoglycemia]].<ref name = Anders_1979>{{cite journal |last1=Defronzo |first1=RA |last2=Tobin |first2=JD |last3=Andres |first3=R |title=Glucose clamp technique: a method for quantifying insulin secretion and resistance |journal=The American journal of physiology |volume=237 |issue=3 |pages=E214–23 |year=1979 |pmid=382871}}</ref> It is a type of [[glucose clamp technique]]. The test is rarely performed in clinical care, but is used in medical research, for example, to assess the effects of different medications. The rate of glucose infusion is commonly referred to in diabetes literature as the GINF value.<ref name="Muniyappa">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17957034|title=Current approaches for assessing insulin sensitivity and resistance in vivo: advantages, limitations, and appropriate usage|author=Muniyappa R|journal=Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab|year=2008|pmid=17957034|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00645.2007|volume=294|issue=1|pages=E15–E26|author-separator=,|display-authors=1|last2=Lee|first2=S.|last3=Chen|first3=H.|last4=Quon|first4=M. J.}}</ref>

The procedure takes about 2 hours. Through a [[peripheral vein]], [[insulin]] is infused at 10-120 mU per m<sup>2</sup> per [[minute]]. In order to compensate for the insulin [[intravenous|infusion]], [[glucose]] 20% is infused to maintain blood sugar levels between 5 and 5.5&nbsp;mmol/l. The rate of glucose infusion is determined by checking the [[blood sugar]] levels every 5 to 10 minutes. Low-dose insulin infusions are more useful for assessing the response of the liver, whereas high-dose insulin infusions are useful for assessing peripheral (i.e., muscle and fat) insulin action.<ref name="Muniyappa" />

The rate of glucose infusion during the last 30 minutes of the test determines insulin sensitivity. If high levels (7.5&nbsp;mg/min or higher) are required, the patient is insulin-sensitive. Very low levels (4.0&nbsp;mg/min or lower) indicate that the body is resistant to insulin action. Levels between 4.0 and 7.5&nbsp;mg/min are not definitive and suggest "impaired glucose tolerance," an early sign of insulin resistance.<ref name="Muniyappa" />

This basic technique can be significantly enhanced by the use of glucose tracers. Glucose can be labeled with either stable or radioactive atoms. Commonly-used tracers are 3-<sup>3</sup>H glucose (radioactive), 6,6 <sup>2</sup>H-glucose (stable) and 1-<sup>13</sup>C Glucose (stable). Prior to beginning the hyperinsulinemic period, a 3h tracer infusion enables one to determine the basal rate of glucose production. During the clamp, the plasma tracer concentrations enable the calculation of whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, as well as the production of glucose by the body (i.e., endogenous glucose production).<ref name="Muniyappa" />

;Modified Insulin Suppression Test
Another measure of insulin resistance is the modified insulin suppression test developed by Gerald Reaven at Stanford University. The test correlates well with the euglycemic clamp with less operator-dependent error. This test has been used to advance the large body of research relating to the metabolic syndrome.<ref name="Muniyappa" />

Patients initially receive 25 mcg of octreotide (Sandostatin) in 5 ml of normal saline over 3 to 5 min IV as an initial bolus, and then are infused continuously with an intravenous infusion of somatostatin (0.27 μgm/m<sup>2</sup>/min) to suppress endogenous insulin and glucose secretion. Insulin and 20% glucose is then infused at rates of 32 and 267&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/min, respectively. Blood glucose is checked at zero, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and then every 10 minutes for the last half-hour of the test. These last 4 values are averaged to determine the steady-state plasma glucose level (SSPG). Subjects with an SSPG greater than 150&nbsp;mg/dl are considered to be insulin-resistant.<ref name="Muniyappa" />

===Alternatives===
Given the complicated nature of the "clamp" technique (and the potential dangers of [[hypoglycemia]] in some patients), alternatives have been sought to simplify the measurement of insulin resistance. The first was the [[homeostatic model assessment|Homeostatic Model Assessment]] (HOMA), and a more recent method is the [[Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index]] (QUICKI). Both employ [[fasting]] [[insulin]] and [[glucose]] levels to calculate insulin resistance, and both correlate reasonably with the results of clamping studies. Wallace ''et al.'' point out that QUICKI is the [[logarithm]] of the value from one of the HOMA equations.<ref name=Wallace_2004>{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/diacare.27.6.1487 |last1=Wallace |first1=TM |last2=Levy |first2=JC |last3=Matthews |first3=DR |title=Use and abuse of HOMA modeling |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=1487–1495 |year=2004 |pmid=15161807}}</ref>

==Management==
The primary treatment for insulin resistance is [[exercise]] and [[weight loss]]. Low-[[glycemic load]] diet has also been shown to help.<ref name=Boden_2005>{{cite journal |last1=Boden  |last2=Sargrad |first2=K |last3=Homko |first3=C |last4=Mozzoli |first4=M |last5=Stein |first5=TP |title=Effect of a low-carbohydrate diet on appetite, blood glucose levels, and insulin resistance in obese patients with type 2 diabetes |journal=Annals of internal medicine |volume=142 |issue=6 |pages=403–11 |year=2005 |pmid=15767618 |first1=G}}</ref> Both [[metformin]] and the [[thiazolidinedione]]s improve insulin resistance, but are only approved therapies for type 2 diabetes, not insulin resistance. By contrast, [[Growth hormone treatment|growth hormone replacement therapy]] may be associated with increased insulin resistance.<ref name=Bramnert_2003>{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.2002-020542 |last1=Bramnert |first1=M |last2=Segerlantz |first2=M |last3=Laurila |first3=E |last4=Daugaard |first4=JR |last5=Manhem |first5=P |last6=Groop |first6=L |title=Growth hormone replacement therapy induces insulin resistance by activating the glucose-fatty acid cycle |journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=1455–1463 |year=2003 |pmid=12679422}}</ref>

Metformin has become one of the more commonly prescribed medications for insulin resistance, and currently a newer drug, [[exenatide]] (marketed as Byetta), is being used. Exenatide has not been approved in the UK except for use in diabetics, but often improves insulin resistance in healthy individuals by the same mechanism as it does in diabetics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The ''Diabetes Prevention Program'' showed that exercise and diet were nearly twice as effective as [[metformin]] at reducing the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes.<ref name=Knowler_2002>{{cite journal |last1=Knowler |first1=WC |last2=Barrett-Connor |first2=E |last3=Fowler |first3=SE |last4=Hamman |first4=RF |last5=Lachin |first5=JM |last6=Walker |first6=EA |last7=Nathan |first7=DM |author8=Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group |title=Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=346 |issue=6 |pages=393–403 |year=2002 |pmid=11832527 |pmc=1370926 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa012512}}</ref> One 2009 study has found that carbohydrate deficit after exercise, but not energy deficit, contributed to insulin sensitivity increase.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Newsom |first1=S.

Some types of [[monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated fatty acids]], saturated, and trans fats promote insulin resistance.

Caffeine intake limits insulin action, but not enough to increase blood sugar levels in healthy persons. People who already have diabetes II can see a small increase in levels if they take 2 or 2<small>1/2</small> cups of coffee per day.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-sugar/AN01804 Does caffeine affect blood sugar?], Mayo Clinic,</ref>

==History==
The concept that insulin resistance may be the underlying cause of [[diabetes mellitus]] type 2 was first advanced by Prof. Wilhelm Falta and published in Vienna in 1931,<ref name=Falta_1931>{{cite journal |last1=Falta |first1=W. |last2=Boller |first2=R. |title=Insulärer und Insulinresistenter Diabetes |journal=Klinische Wochenschrift |volume=10 |pages=438–443 |year=1931 |doi=10.1007/BF01736348 |issue=10}}</ref> and confirmed as contributary by Sir [[Harold Percival Himsworth]] of the University College Hospital Medical Centre in London in 1936.<ref name=Himsworth_1936>{{cite journal |last1=Himsworth |first1=H |title=Diabetes mellitus: its differentiation into insulin-sensitive and insulin insensitive types |journal=The Lancet |volume=227 |pages=127–130 |year=1936 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)36134-2 |issue=5864}}</ref> However, type 2 diabetes does not occur unless there is concurrent failure of compensatory insulin secretion.<ref name=Nolan_2010>{{cite journal  | last1=Nolan | first1=C |title=Failure of islet β-cell compensation for insulin resistance causes type 2 diabetes: What causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis? |journal=Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology |volume=25 |pages=1594–1597 |year=2010  | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06473.x  | pmid=20880166  | issue=10}}</ref>
