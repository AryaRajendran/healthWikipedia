'''Viaspan''' was the trademark under which the University of Wisconsin cold storage solution (also known as '''University of Wisconsin solution''' or '''UW solution''') was sold. Currently, '''UW solution''' is sold under the ViaSpan trademark and several other trademarks. '''UW solution''' was the first solution thoughtfully designed for use in [[organ transplant]]ation, and became the first [[intracellular]]-like preservation medium.  Developed in the late 1980s by Folkert Belzer and James Southard for [[pancreas]] preservation, the solution soon displaced [[EuroCollins]] solution as the preferred medium for cold storage of [[liver]]s and [[kidney]]s, as well as pancreas. The solution has also been used for [[heart]]s and other [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. <strong>University of Wisconsin cold storage solution</strong> remains what is often called the ''[[Gold standard (disambiguation)|gold standard]]'' for organ preservation,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Southard JH, Belzer FO | title=Organ preservation | journal=Annu Rev Med  | volume=46 | issue=1 | year=1995 | pages=235&ndash;47  | pmid=7598460 | doi=10.1146/annurev.med.46.1.235 }}</ref> despite the development of other solutions that are in some respects superior.<ref>{{cite journal | author=MÃ¼hlbacher F, Langer F, Mittermayer C | title=Preservation solutions for transplantation | journal=Transplant Proc  | volume=31 | issue=5 | year=1999 | pages=2069&ndash;70  | pmid=10455972 | doi=10.1016/S0041-1345(99)00265-1 }}</ref> 

The guiding principles for the development of Viaspan were:
#[[osmosis|osmotic]] concentration maintained by the use of metabolically inert substances like [[lactobionate]] and [[raffinose]] rather than with [[glucose]]
#[[Hydroxyethyl starch]] (HES) is used to prevent [[edema]]
#Substances are added to scavenge [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], along with [[steroid]]s and [[insulin]].
