'''Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification''', also known as '''Fahr disease''' or '''Fahr's Syndrome''' is a rare,<ref>http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?PageID=4&diseaseID=8272</ref> [[dominance relationship|genetically dominant]], inherited [[neurology|neurological]] disorder characterized by abnormal deposits of [[calcium]] in areas of the [[brain]] that control movement. Through the use of CT scans calcifications are seen primarily in the [[basal ganglia]] and in other areas such as the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benke T, Karner E, Seppi K, Delazer M, Marksteiner J, Donnemiller E |title=Subacute dementia and imaging correlates in a case of Fahr's disease |journal=J.

==History and terminology==
The disease was first noted by [[Germany|German]] neurologist [[Karl Theodor Fahr]] in 1930.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fahr, T. |title=Idiopathische Verkalkung der Hirngefässe |journal=Zentralblatt für allgemeine Pathologie und pathologische Anatomie |volume=50 |issue= |pages=129–133 |year=1930-1931 }}
</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|451|Fahr's disease}}</ref> A less common name for the condition is Chavany-Brunhes syndrome and Fritsche's syndrome, the former named after [[Jacques Brunhes]], [[Jean Alfred Émile Chavany]], while the later named after [[R.

==Pathology==

The most commonly affected region of the brain is the [[lenticular nucleus]] and in particular the internal [[globus pallidus]].<ref name=Bonazza2011>{{cite journal |author=Bonazza S, La Morgia C, Martinelli P, Capellari S |title=Strio-pallido-dentate calcinosis: a diagnostic approach in adult patients |journal=Neurol. Sci. |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=537–45 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21479613 |doi=10.1007/s10072-011-0514-7 }}</ref> Calcifications in the [[caudate]], [[dentate nuclei]], [[putamen]] and [[thalami]] are also common. Occasionally calcifications begin or predominate in regions outside the [[basal ganglia]]. 

Calcification seems to be progressive, since calcifications are generally more extensive in older individuals and an increase in calcification can sometimes be documented on follow up of affected subjects. 

As well as the usual sites the [[cerebellar gyri]], [[brain stem]], [[centrum semiovale]] and subcortical white matter may also be affected.

Diffuse atrophic changes with dilatation of the subarachnoid space and/or ventricular system may coexist with the calcifications.

Histologically concentric calcium deposits within the walls of small and medium-sized arteries are present. Less frequently the veins may also be affected. Droplet calcifications can be observed along capillaries. These deposits may eventually lead to closure of the lumina of vessels. 

The pallidal deposits stain positively for iron. Diffuse gliosis may surround the large deposits but significant loss of nerve cells is rare.

On electron microscopy the mineral deposits appear as amorphous or crystalline material surrounded by a basal membrane. Calcium granules are seen within the cytoplasm of neuronal and glial cells.

===Note===

The calcifications seen in this condition are '''not''' distinguishable from those secondary to [[hypoparathyroidism]] or other causes.

==Clinical features==

The disease usually manifests itself in the third to fifth decade of life but may appear in childhood or later in life.<ref name=Sobrido2007>Sobrido MJ, Hopfer S, Geschwind DH (2007) "[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1421/ Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification]." In: Pagon RA, Bird TD, Dolan CR, Stephens K, editors. SourceGeneReviews [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993–2004</ref> It usually presents with clumsiness, fatigability, unsteady gait, slow or slurred speech, dysphagia, involuntary movements or muscle cramping. Seizures of various types are common. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, which may be the first or the most prominent manifestations, range from mild difficulty with concentration and memory to changes in personality and/or behavior, to psychosis and dementia.<ref name=Chiu1993>{{cite journal |author=Chiu HF, Lam LC, Shum PP, Li KW |title=Idiopathic calcification of the basal ganglia |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=69 |issue=807 |pages=68–70 |year=1993 |month=January |pmid=8446558 |pmc=2399589 |url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8446558}}</ref>

The diagnosis requires:
# the presence of bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia
# the presence of progressive neurologic dysfunction
# the absence of an alternative metabolic, infectious, toxic or traumatic cause
# a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance

The calcification is usually identified on CT scan but may be visible on plain films of the skull.

==Investigations==

In addition to the usual routine haematologic and biochemical investigations, the serum [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[alkaline phosphatase]], [[calcitonin]] and [[parathyroid hormone]] should also be measured. The [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) should be examined to exclude [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[parasite]]s.<ref name=Morita1998>{{cite journal |author=Morita M, Tsuge I, Matsuoka H, ''et al.'' |title=Calcification in the basal ganglia with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection |journal=Neurology |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1485–8 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9596016 }}</ref> The Ellsworth Howard test (a 10-20 fold increase of urinary cyclic [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] excretion following stimulation with 200 micromoles of parathyroid hormone) may be worth doing also. Serology for [[toxoplasmosis]] is also indicated. 

Brain CT scan is the preferred method of localizing and assessing the extent of cerebral calcifications.

===Notes===

Elevated levels of [[copper]], [[iron]], magnesium and [[zinc]] but not calcium have been reported in the CSF but the significance of this finding — if any — is not known.<ref name=Hozumi2011>{{cite journal |author=Hozumi I, Kohmura A, Kimura A, ''et al.'' |title=High Levels of Copper, Zinc, Iron and Magnesium, but not Calcium, in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Patients with Fahr's Disease |journal=Case Rep Neurol |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=46–51 |year=2010 |pmid=20671856 |pmc=2905580 |doi=10.1159/000313920 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=10.1159/000313920}}</ref>

==Management==

There is currently no [[cure]] for Fahr's Syndrome, nor a standard course of treatment. The available treatment is directed symptomatic control. If parkinsonian features develop there is generally poor response to [[levodopa]] therapy. Case reports have suggested that [[haloperidol]] or [[lithium carbonate]] may help with [[psychotic]] symptoms.<ref name=Munir1986>{{cite journal |author=Munir KM |title=The treatment of psychotic symptoms in Fahr's disease with lithium carbonate |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=36–8 |year=1986 |month=February |pmid=3081601 }}</ref> One case report described an improvement with the use of a bisphosphonate.<ref name=Loeb1998>{{cite journal |author=Loeb JA |title=Functional improvement in a patient with cerebral calcinosis using a bisphosphonate |journal=Mov. Disord. |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=345–9 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9539353 |doi=10.1002/mds.870130225 }}</ref> 

Genetic counseling may be helpful.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis for any individual with Fahr's Syndrome is variable and hard to predict. There is no reliable correlation between age, extent of calcium deposits in the brain, and neurological deficit. Since the appearance of calcification is age-dependent, a [[CT scan]] could be negative in a gene carrier who is younger than the age of 55.

Progressive neurological deterioration generally results in disability and death.
