'''Muhadhdhabuddin Abd al-Rahim bin Ali bin Hamid al-Dimashqi''' ({{lang-ar|<big>مهذب الدين عبد الرحيم بن علي بن حامد الدمشقي</big>}}) known as '''al-Dakhwar''' ({{lang-ar|<big>الدخوار</big>}}) (1170–1230) was a leading [[Arab]] physician in the 13th century where he served various rulers of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]].<ref name="Ali40">Ali, 1996, p.40.</ref> He was also administratively responsible for medicine in [[Cairo]] and [[Damascus]]. Al-Dakhwar educated or influenced most of the prominent physicians of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] in the century,<ref name="Meyerhof9"/> including writer [[Ibn Abi Usaibia]] and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], the discoverer of blood circulation in the human body.<ref name="Ali41"/>

==Early life==
Al-Dakhwar was born and brought up in Damascus,<ref name="Ali40"/> the son of an [[oculist]].<ref name="Meyerhof9"/> Initially, he too was an oculist at the Nuri Hospital of Damascus,<ref name="Mahfuz">Mahfuz, 1935, p.16.</ref> but afterward he studied medicine with Ibn al-Matran.<ref name="Meyerhof9">Meyerhof, 1968, p.9.</ref>

==Physician of the Ayyubids==
In 1208, [[al-Adil]], the [[Sultan of Egypt]], told his vizier al-Sahib ibn Shukur, that he was in need of another physician with the equivalent skill of the chief of medicine at the time, Abd al-Aziz al-Sulami. Al-Adil believed that al-Sulami was busy enough serving as physician of the army. Ibn Shukur recommended al-Dakhwar for the post and offered him 30 [[dinar]]s a month. Al-Dakhwar turned him down, citing that al-Sulami receives 100 dinars a month and stating "I know my ability in this field and I will not take less!"<ref>Leiser and al-Khaledy, 2004, p.5.</ref> Al-Sulami died on June 7 and soon after al-Dakhwar himself came into contact with [[al-Adil]],<ref name="Mahfuz"/> and the latter was greatly impressed by him. He not only appointed him as his personal physician, but also as one of his confidants.<ref name="Ali40"/>

When al-Adil died, his son and successor in Damascus, [[al-Mu'azzam]], made him chief superintendent of the Nasiri Hospital. There he wrote books and gave lectures on medicine to his students. Later, when al-Adil's other son [[al-Ashraf]] annexed Damascus after al-Mu'azzam died, al-Dakhwar was promoted as chief medical officer of the Ayyubid state.<ref name="Ali41">Ali, 1996, p.41.</ref>
