The '''sarcoglycanopathies''' are a collection of diseases resulting from [[mutation]]s in any of the four [[sarcoglycan]] genes: α, β, γ or δ.
The four sarcoglycanopathies are: α-sarcoglycanopathy, [[limb-girdle muscular dystrophy|LGMD2D]]; β-sarcoglycanopathy, LGMD2E; γ-sarcoglycanopathy, LGMD2C and δ-sarcoglycanopathy, LGMD2F. The four different sarcoglycan genes encode proteins that form a [[tetramer]]ic complex at the muscle [[Cell membrane|cell plasma membrane]]. This complex stabilizes the association of [[dystrophin]] with the [[dystroglycan]]s and contributes to the stability of the plasma membrane [[cytoskeleton]]. The four sarcoglycan genes are related to each other structurally and functionally, but each has a distinct [[chromosome]] location.

In outbred populations, the relative frequency of mutations in the four genes is alpha >> beta >> gamma >> delta in a 8:4:2:1 ratio. No common mutations have been identified in outbred populations except the R77C mutation, which accounts for up to one-third of the mutated [[SGCA]] [[allele]]s. Founder mutations have been observed in certain populations.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1408/ GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Overview] Retrieved 2012-04-09.</ref> A 1997 Italian clinical study demonstrated variations in [[muscular dystrophy]] progression dependent on the sarcoglycan gene affected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Angelini C, Fanin M, Freda MP, Duggan DJ, Siciliano G, Hoffman EP |title=The clinical spectrum of sarcoglycanopathies |journal=Neurology |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=176–9 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9921870 |doi=10.1212/WNL.52.1.176 |url=http://www.neurology.org/content/52/1/176.full}}</ref>
