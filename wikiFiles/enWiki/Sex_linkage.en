'''Sex linkage''' is the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] expression of an [[allele]] related to the chromosomal sex of the individual. This mode of inheritance is in contrast to the inheritance of traits on [[autosome|autosomal]] chromosomes, where both sexes have the same probability of inheritance. Since humans have many more genes on the X than the Y, there are many more X-linked traits than Y-linked traits. 

In [[mammal]]s, the female is the [[homogametic]] sex, with two [[X chromosome]]s (XX), while the male is [[heterogametic]], with one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Genes on the X or [[Y chromosome]] are called sex-linked. 

In birds, the opposite is true: the male is the homogametic sex, having two [[ZW sex-determination system|Z chromosomes]] (ZZ), and the female (hen) is heterogametic, having one Z and one W chromosome (ZW).

[[X-linked recessive]] traits are expressed in all heterogametics, but are only expressed in those homogametics that are [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] for the recessive allele. For example, an X-linked recessive allele in humans causes [[hemophilia]]. Hemophilia is much more common in males than females because males are [[Zygosity#Hemizygous|hemizygous]] - they only have one copy of the gene in question - and therefore express the trait when they inherit one mutant allele. In contrast, a female must inherit two mutant alleles, a less frequent event since the mutant allele is rare in the population.  [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei]] of Russia was the most famous sufferer of X-linked hemophilia.

The incidence of recessive X-linked phenotypes in females is the square of that in males (squaring a proportion less than one gives an outcome closer to 0 than the original). If 1 in 20 males in a human population are [[color blindness|red-green color blind]], then 1 in 400 females in the population are expected to be color-blind (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>)*(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>). (The term 'color-blind' is not completely accurate. There are degrees of weakness in color vision and it is now called 'color vision deficiency')

X-linked traits are maternally inherited from carrier mothers or from an affected father.  Each son born to a carrier mother has a 50% probability of inheriting the X-chromosome carrying the mutant allele.  There are a few Y-linked traits; these are inherited from the father. 

In classical genetics, a [[reciprocal cross]] is performed to test if a trait is sex-linked.

==X-linked dominant inheritance==
[[File:Sex linked inheritance.png|thumb|An example pedigree chart of the inheritance of a sex linked disorder.]]
Each child of a mother affected with an X-linked dominant trait has a 1/2 chance of inheriting the mutation and thus being affected with the disorder. All female children of an affected father will be affected (daughters possess their fathers' X-chromosome). No male children of an affected father will be affected (sons do not inherit their fathers' X-chromosome).

===Examples===

*[[Alport's syndrome]]
*[[Aarsog's syndrome]]
*[[Coffin-Lowry syndrome]] (CLS)
*[[idiopathic hypoparathyroidism]]
*[[incontinentia pigmenti]]
*[[Ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency]]
*[[Rett syndrome]] (RS)
*[[vitamin D]] resistant [[rickets]]
*[[fragile X syndrome]]

===X-linked recessive inheritance===
Females possessing one X-linked recessive mutation are considered carriers and will generally not manifest clinical symptoms of the disorder. All males possessing an X-linked recessive mutation will be affected. (Males have a single X-chromosome and therefore have only one copy of X-linked genes.)  All offspring of a carrier female have a 1 in 2 chance of inheriting the mutation. All female children of an affected father will be carriers. (Daughters possess their father's X-chromosome.) No male children of an affected father will be affected. (Sons do not inherit their father's X-chromosome.)

====Examples====
*[[Adrenoleukodystrophy|ALD]]
*[[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]
*[[Hunter syndrome]]
*[[Menkes disease]] (kinky hair syndrome)
*[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]]
*[[Hemophilia]] A and B
*[[Fabry's disease]]
*[[Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome]]
*[[Bruton's agammaglobulinemia]]
*[[Color blindness]]
*[[Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]]
*Congenital aqueductal stenosis ([[hydrocephalus]])
*Inherited nephrogenic [[diabetes insipidus]]

==Sex-linked traits in other animals==
*Fur color in domestic [[cat]]s: the gene that causes orange pigment is on the X chromosome; thus a [[Calico cat|Calico]] or [[tortoiseshell cat]], with both black (or gray) and orange pigment, is nearly always female.

=== Sex-limited traits ===
These are characters only expressed in one sex. They may be caused by genes on either autosomal or sex chromosomes.<ref name=King/> Examples: female sterility in ''Drosophila''; and many [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] characters in insects, especially in relation to [[mimicry]].
