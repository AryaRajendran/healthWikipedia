{{Main|Teenage pregnancy}}

'''Teenage pregnancy in the United Kingdom''' is a long-standing social phenomenon. The only other [[OECD]] developed country with comparable teenage pregnancy rates is the [[United States]]. Teenage pregnancy is higher in more economically deprived areas. A report in 2002 found that around half of all conceptions to under 18s was concentrated among the 30% most deprived population, with only 14% occurring among the 30% least deprived.  Also found was that the most deprived areas had higher proportions of conceptions leading to a maternity.<ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=6725 Teenage Conceptions By Small Area Deprivation In England and Wales 2001-2]" (Spring 2007)''Health Statistics Quarterly Volume 33''</ref> The 2008 underage conception rate in England and Wales is down 13% since 1998.<ref>"[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2008_0033 Teen Pregnancy Rates Lowest For Over 20 Years]" ''DCSF''</ref> Over 60% of the conceptions led to a legal [[abortion]],<ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=15055 Conception Statistics 2006 (provisional)]" ''Office for National Statistics''</ref> the highest proportion since conception statistics began in 1969.

==Comparative pregnancy rate==
The United Kingdom currently has the highest teenage birth rate in Western Europe. It is a long-standing social phenomenon that successive governments have attempted to tackle without major success. The Labour Governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] pledged to halve the number of conceptions to girls under 18 by 2010. In this they were unsuccessful, with only a 13% drop recorded in 2008, a level the then Secretary of State for Children [[Ed Balls]] admitted was 'disappointing',<ref>{{cite web|last=Bawden|first=Anna|title=Teenage pregnancy rates fall, but not far enough.|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/feb/24/teenage-pregnancy-rates-2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11/08/2012}}</ref> although numbers continued to fall over the following two years, with a 9.5% drop in the figures in 2010 despite an overall increase in fertility.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Michelle|title=Teen pregnancy rate lowest since 1969|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17190185|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>   Over the last fifty years the proportion of teenagers and in particular those under the age of 16 who have experienced sexual intercourse has increased dramatically. The 2001 survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles revealed that over 90% of teenagers had experience of sexual intercourse and around a quarter had before the age of 16. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Though with the increase in the proportion having intercourse, there has also been an increase in the knowledge and use of contraception, through sex education and the upsurge in family planning clinics.

===Change in pregnancy rate over time===
Births to teenagers increased during the 1960s and peaked in 1971 at 50.6 per thousand of the population. Since 1971 they have gradually fallen to their lowest level since the mid Fifties. The proportion occurring outside marriage has increased from around one in six in the 1950s to nine in every ten in 2006. Teenage abortion rates are currently at their highest rate since legalisation in 1968. Although the number of conceptions are falling the proportion ending in abortion has increased over the last ten years.

===Geographic variation in pregnancy rate===
High teenage pregnancy rates are found in areas with low GCSE exam success such as [[Nottingham]], [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Doncaster]], [[Barnsley]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Manchester]] (highest), [[Sandwell]], [[Bristol]], [[Stoke on Trent]], [[Bradford]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], and [[Blackpool]]. In 1997, a study revealed that there was a north-south divide in England in the rate of conceptions to under 18s, with the highest rates and proportion leading to maternity being in the north, and the lowest rates with the highest proportion leading to abortion, being in the south, with the exception of [[London]], which had both high rates of conception and abortion.<ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=6303 Geographic Variations In Conceptions Under 18 During the 1990's]" (Winter 2000) ''Population Trends Volume 102''</ref>

===Pregnancy rate by ethnicity===
Among [[White British]], 50 per cent of births are outside marriage. The highest levels of births outside marriage, more than 60 per cent, were among [[Black British]] mothers. Among [[British Asian]] mothers, the rates of birth outside marriage is only 2 per cent.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1034254/Most-British-babies-born-wedlock-migrants-tiny-minority.html#ixzz20g3TmrRZ Most British babies now born out of wedlock, but for some migrants, it's a tiny minority]</ref>

==Sexual health==

===Sexual activity and contraception use===
'''1952:''' The [[Family Planning Association]], which was set up in the 1930s, began to offer [[contraceptive]] advice to single women who were just about to wed.<ref>"[http://www.fpa.org.uk/information/factsheets History of Family Planning Services]" FPA</ref>

'''1954:''' A study in Manchester revealed that between the years 1937 and 1954, almost a quarter of under-age girls coming to the attention of one female police officer regarding underage sex were pregnant. It was also noted that the girls often came from particular backgrounds, either broken homes or of bad parental influence. It was also revealed that they also tended to have a lower than average IQ.<ref>"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=2027646&pageindex=3#page Carnal Knowledge Cases]" ''British Medical Journal 6 December 1958 page 1406''</ref>

'''1961:''' A study of [[Scotland|Scottish]] women revealed that almost a quarter of single women were sexually experienced before their 20th birthday, the proportion haven risen from 6% during the late 1940s and 15% during the late 1950s. The findings of the study showed that there was a clear increase in sexual intercourse among young single women before the advent of the contraceptive pill in 1961.<ref>Margaret Bone Trends In Women's Sexual Behaviour In Scotland (spring 1983)''Population Trends Volume 43''</ref>

The [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] became available, though initially only to married women. The proportion of teenage women who were married rose from 5% in 1951 to 8%.

'''1964:'''  The first comprehensive survey of sexual behaviour in United Kingdom amongst unmarried teenagers revealed that a third of boys and almost one in six girls were sexually experienced by the age of 18.

Helen Brook set-up the Brook Advisory Centres offering [[contraceptive]] advice to young single people under the age of 25.

'''1967:''' A change in the law allowed local health authorities to offer [[contraceptive]] services to unmarried people if they so wished; though by 1968 only one in six authorities were providing such a service.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.4.5686.760 |title=Family planning services |journal=Br Med J |volume=4 |issue=5686 |pages=760 |year=1969 |month=December |pmid=5359939 |pmc=1630272 }}</ref> Mr K Robinson answering a question in the House Of Commons regarding the new Family Planning Act in October 1967, stated that it would be unwise to exclude girls under 16 from receiving advice at family planning clinics (FPC). Though these girls would only be seen at FPCs in exceptional circumstances even with parental consent.<ref>"[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/oct/23/national-health-service-family-planning#S5CV0751P0-03571 Family Planning Act ]" (23 October 1967) "House of Commons Debates"</ref>

'''1969:''' Brook Advisory Centres were now offering contraceptive advice to over ten thousand unmarried people under 25, the majority were aged between 19 and 21 with around one in six being under 19.<ref name=PMC1795410p5>"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1795410&pageindex=5#page Professional Secrecy]" (20 March 1971) ''British Medical Journal-Supplement.''</ref>

'''1970:''' The Family Planning Association were now mandated to offer contraception to unmarried people.

'''1971:''' A [[Physician|doctor]] was reported for informing the parents of a 16 year-old girl that she had come to him seeking contraception. This prompted the [[British Medical Association]] to advise doctors to maintain young patients' confidentiality when seeking [[contraception]]. Three quarters of teenagers visiting Brook Advisory Centres during the early '70s were doing so without their parents' knowledge.<ref name=PMC1795410p5/>

A survey of [[Scotland|Scottish]] single female students revealed that a third had had sexual intercourse by the age of 18 with over half not using any form of contraception. The survey also showed that one in seven girls who had recently been sexually active, their partner was a casual boyfriend.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5815.694 |author=McCance C, Hall DJ |title=Sexual behaviour and contraceptive practice of unmarried female undergraduates at Aberdeen University |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5815 |pages=694–700 |year=1972 |month=June |pmid=5031716 |pmc=1788912 }}</ref>

Controversy was sparked when a 12-year-old girl who had just recently undergone an abortion was put on the contraceptive pill with her parents' consent by gynecologist Dr Mary Wilson at Calthorpe nursing home in Birmingham. She said "so many girls come back pregnant again after three or four months, that is why I gave her a supply of the pill and contraceptive advice". Labour MP Leo Abse was concerned that the prescribing of the pill to a 12-year-old child was an offence under the sexual offences act.<ref>''Daily Mirror'' (June 22, 1971)</ref>

'''1975:''' Under the new [[National Health Service]] reorganisation act contraception was made available free of charge to everyone including single people and those aged under 16. Clarification was given to doctors that they could provide contraception to patients under 16 without parental consent in certain circumstances.

The average age of first [[sexual intercourse]] for girls had now dropped from 21 in the mid-1950s to 18. Over a quarter of boys under 16 and almost one in eight girls under 16 were now sexually experienced.<ref>Kaye Wellings et al. Sexual Behaviour In Britain (1994)</ref> 

'''1976''' A report by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service found that 69 percent of girls under 16 who came to them for an abortion during the year had used no contraception. Most of them were experienced at sex.<ref>''Daily Express'' (26 April 1978) page  2</ref> 

'''1978:''' Brook Advisory Centres were now government funded. 3% of Brook's clients were now under the age of 16.

'''1980:''' A review of the 1974 [[DHSS]] circular about parental consent and the issuing of contraception/abortion advice to girls under 16, concluded that a doctor or a professional worker should always seek to persuade the child to involve her parents or guardian at the earliest stage of consultation. Though it is accepted that occasionally contraception would be given without parental consent.<ref>"[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1980/may/06/contraceptives-school-children#S5CV0984P0-05275 Contraceptives (School Children]" (6 May 1980) "House of Commons Debate"</ref>

===Abortions===
'''1967:''' Abortion was legalised in England, Wales and Scotland under the Abortion Act. The first legalised abortions were performed on April 27, 1968.

'''1969:''' Over nine and a half thousand teenage girls (over one thousand two hundred being under 16) opted for an [[abortion]] in England, Wales & Scotland in the first full year of legalisation, (almost one in five of all abortions) the majority of whom were single. A survey of women seeking an abortion by the [[British Pregnancy Advisory Service]] revealed that almost two fifths of parents of single pregnant teenage girls were unaware of their daughters [[pregnancy]], the majority of these being to teenagers who were not living at home.<ref>"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1799057&pageindex=1 Survey Of 3000 unwanted Pregnancies]" Joan Lambert (16 October 1971) ''British Medical Journal''</ref>

'''1982:''' In a court ruling a pregnant fifteen-year-old girl, who had been pregnant once before was allowed to have an abortion against the wishes of her father - who did not want her to have one on religious and moral grounds.

Seven out of ten of the areas with the highest rate were in London. Outside London the PCO's with the highest rates were Darlington (8.0), Manchester (7.3) and Hartlepool (7.2). The rate for the whole of England & Wales was 4.1.

===Births===
'''1951:''' Throughout the 1940s the teenage birth rate rose from 15.0 in every thousand in 1941 to 21.3. At the end of the second-world war the proportion of teenage births born outside marriage had almost doubled from the beginning of the decade to a third. By 1951, the proportion had dropped to 16% a proportion that remained largely unchanged throughout the decade. There was around one in six pregnant brides during the decade, the proportion being even higher for teenagers with one in four being pregnant on their wedding day.

During the 1950s illegitimate teenage births made up just a small proportion of all [[illegitimate]] births, at just under 15% with over half of all illegitimate births being to women over the age of 25.

'''1959:''' by the end of the 1950s the number of teenage births had risen nearly 50% from thirty-three thousand in 1955 to forty-six thousand, a rate of 31.6. The numbers of births to girls under 16 remained constant during the late 1940s and early half of the 1950s. From 1955 to the end of the Fifties, the numbers of under 16s giving birth more than doubled.

'''1964:''' The number of births to women of all ages had risen 11% since 1960 to a post-World War II high of almost nine hundred thousand. Compared with an increase of almost 49% to seventy-six thousand (43 per thousand) among teenagers in the same period. The number of teenage brides marrying for the first time topped one hundred thousand. The proportion of them pregnant on their wedding day had increased from 25% during the 1950s to almost 40%, more than double the proportion to that of women in their twenties. The proportion of teenage births outside marriage had risen to almost 25%, the most marked increase was in the number of girls under 16 giving birth, with an almost 50% increase between 1959 and 1960 alone. The number of births to girls under 16 had increased by 125% since 1959.

'''1966:''' A Home Office survey on adoption revealed that the natural mother in over half of all illegitimate non-parental adoptions during the year were under the age of 21. There was almost eighteen thousand illegitimate adoptions during the year with fourteen thousand being adopted to someone other than the parent(s) (non-parental).<ref>"[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hors1971.html Home Office survey on adoption]" (1971)</ref>

'''1969:''' Even though the [[birth rate]] to women of all ages was in decline having peaked in 1964, the teenage birth rate continued to rise to a rate of 49.6 per thousand girls.

'''1971:''' Research revealed that illegitimate teenage births were more likely to occur to women from a manual [[social class]] background than a non-manual social class background. Also that over half of women having an illegitimate birth before the age of 18, would go on to have a legitimate birth before the age of 25 compared to only a third for women who did not have an illegitimate birth in their teens.<ref>Barry Werner Fertility & Family Background (Spring 1984) ''Population Trends Volume 35''</ref> 

'''1973:''' Although the overall teenage [[birth rate]] for England & Wales had peaked in 1971, the number occurring to under 16s had continued to rise, to over one thousand seven hundred. This represented a 55% increase since 1964 and a 250% increase since 1959.

'''1974:''' The number of girls under 16 in Scotland giving birth reached 148, up 39% since 1967. The number of abortions occurring to the same age group reached over 200 per year.<ref>"[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/jun/19/abortions-and-illegitimate-births#S5CV0952P0-04668 Abortions & Illegitimate Births]" (19 June 1978 House Of Commons Debates.</ref>

'''1975:''' With the legalisation of abortion and better availability of contraception, the number of pregnant teenage brides had declined by 37% since 1970. The teenage [[birth rate]] also declined to a rate of 36.4 in 1975. However, the proportion of teenage births occurring outside marriage continued to rise to almost one in three.

'''1976:''' The proportion of all illegitimate births occurring to teenagers had more than doubled since the 1950s from 15% to 37%, whilst the proportion occurring to women over the age of 25 had fallen from 56% to 32% in the same period. However, the proportion of births occurring outside marriage to women of all ages was still only 9%.

With the legalisation of abortion came a drop in the numbers of illegitimate children being adopted from a peak of over nineteen thousand in 1968 down to almost nine thousand. In addition, the number of mother and baby homes had declined by nearly 72% since 1966.<ref>"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&pageindex=1&artid=1608584 Mother & Baby Homes]" (1978) ''British Medical Journal''</ref> Much of it due to the decline in the [[social stigma|stigma]] attached to having a baby outside marriage and an increase in [[cohabitation]] among unmarried couples. There was also an increase in the number of never married lone mothers, rising 44% since 1971. With half of all never married lone mothers being under the age of 25.<ref>Richard Leete, "One Parent Families Numbers & Characteristics" (Autumn 1978) ''Population Trends Volume 13''</ref>

'''1981:''' The numbers of under 16s giving birth under 16 fell to their lowest level since 1965.

'''1983:''' The numbers of births to teenagers had fallen by a third since 1971 to over fifty-four thousand, a rate of almost twenty-seven in every thousand. The proportion occurring outside marriage had risen to 56 percent.

'''1986:''' The proportion of teenage women who were married had fallen from a peak of 11% in 1973 to just over 3%. The numbers of births to teenager began to increase, with the proportion of teenage births occurring outside marriage continuing to increase to 69%, almost a third of which were living at the same address at the time of the birth.

'''1990:''' The number of under 16s giving birth had risen 10% since 1981.

'''1996:''' The number of births to all teenagers continued to fall from fifty-four thousand in 1983 to almost forty-five thousand, a rate of almost thirty in every thousand. The proportion occurring outside marriage was almost 89% compared to 36% for women of all ages. Though the number of births occurring to under 16s in England & Wales increased to over one thousand six hundred, their highest level since the early 70s. With another hundred and sixty occurring in Scotland.

'''2001:''' The [[Census]] showed that half of all teenagers with children were lone parents, 40% were cohabiting as a couple and 10% were married.<ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=7522&More=Y Census 2001 People aged 16-29]" ''Office For National Statistics''</ref>

'''2005:''' There were forty-five thousand teenage births with 92% being outside marriage. Almost 74% of the births outside marriage were jointly registered to both parents. Over half of these were residing at the same address at the time of the birth. The teenage birth rate of 26.3.

The numbers of teenage births in Scotland had fallen from five and a half thousand (28.3 per thousand) in 1991 to four thousand one hundred, a rate of 25.8 per thousand, with 97% occurring outside marriage.<ref>"[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/vital-events/vital-events-reference-tables-2006/section-3-births.html Births Scotland 2006]" ''General Register Office For Scotland''</ref>

'''2008:''' The number of births to girls under 20 in England & Wales was 44,690, a provisional rate of 26.2 per thousand teenage women in the population. Despite much media attention and public anger over the UK's high amount of teenage mothers, the rate of births to teenagers is actually at its lowest level since the mid-1950s.

===Trends in teenage pregnancy===
The statistics presented here use the age of a girl at the outcome of her pregnancy (either birth or abortion), these differ from ones used by the UK Government to track the teenage pregnancy rate. Their statistics, which are widely quoted are calculated using the age of the girl at conception. They are unique as in no other country in the world compile their pregnancy statistics this way. Using pregnancy statistics by age of girl at outcome of her pregnancy thus enables comparison with other countries in the world.
