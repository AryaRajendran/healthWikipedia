The '''pulvinar nuclei''' (nuclei pulvinares) are a collection of [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] located in the pulvinar [[thalamus]].  The pulvinar part is the most posterior region of the thalamus.

The pulvinar is usually grouped as one of the ''lateral thalamic nuclei'' in rodents and carnivores, and stands as an independent complex in primates. The word is derived from the Latin ''pulvinus'' for "cushion".  In [[Ancient Roman religion]] a pulvinar was an "[[empty throne]]" or cushioned couch for occupation by a deity.

==Divisions==
It is conventionally divided into anterior, inferior, lateral, and medial subdivisions, each containing multiple nuclei.

* The ''lateral'' and ''inferior'' pulvinar have widespread connections with early [[visual cortex|visual cortical]] areas.

* The dorsal part of ''lateral'' pulvinar predominantly has connections with [[posterior parietal]] cortex and the [[dorsal stream]] cortical areas.

* The ''medial'' pulvinar has widespread connections with [[cingulate]], [[posterior parietal]], [[premotor]] and [[prefrontal]] cortical areas.

* The pulvinar also has input from the [[superior colliculus]] to ''inferior'', ''lateral'' and ''medial'' sections, which seems to be important in the initiation and compensation of [[saccade]],<ref>Berman, R., & Wurtz, R. (2011). Signals conveyed in the pulvinar pathway from superior
colliculus to cortical area mt. The Journal of Neuroscience, 31(2), 373-384.</ref><ref>Robinson, D., & Petersen, S. (1985). Responses of pulvinar neurons to real and self-induced stimulus movement. Brain research, 338(2), 392-394.</ref> as well as the regulation of visual attention<ref>Petersen, S., Robinson, D., & Morris, J. (1987). Contributions of the pulvinar to visual spatial attention. Neuropsychologia, 25(1), 97-105.</ref><ref>Chalupa, L. (1991). Visual function of the pulvinar. The Neural Basis of Visual Function. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, pp. 140-159.</ref>

==Species variation==

The pulvinar varies in importance in different animals: it is virtually nonexistent in the rat, and grouped as the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex" with the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus due to its small size in cats. In humans it makes up roughly 40% of the thalamus making it the largest of its nuclei.<ref>LaBerge, D. (1999). Attention pp. 44-98. In Cognitive science (Handbook of Perception and Cognition, Second Edition), Bly BM, Rumelhart DE. (edits). Academic Press ISBN 978-0-12-601730-4 p. 73</ref>

==Pathology==
Lesions of the pulvinar can result in [[neglect syndromes]] and [[attentional deficits]].<ref>Arend, I., Rafal, R., & Ward, R. (2008). Spatial and temporal deficits are regionally dissociable in patients with pulvinar lesions. Brain, 131(8), 2140-2152.</ref>
