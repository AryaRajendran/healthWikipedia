==Life==
Foville was born in [[Pontoise]], [[France]] and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|medical doctorate]] in 1824, after studying medicine under [[Léon Louis Rostan]] and [[Jean Étienne Dominique Esquirol]] at [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital]]. His medical thesis argued mental illness may be curable, discussing some treatments of the day and their apparent effectiveness.<ref name = "TSR">{{cite journal | title = The Southern Retreat, Thomas Hodgkin, and Achille-Louis Foville. | author = C L Cherry | journal = Medical History | date = July 1979 | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 314–324 | pmid = 395377 | pmc = 1082477}}</ref> The next year, he was made the medical superintendent of the Saint-Yon asylum in [[Rouen]].  During his time there he published several papers on disorders of the nervous system which were well received.  His son [[Achille-Louis-François Foville]] was born in 1831.<ref name = "CCN">{{cite book | title = Companion to Clinical Neurology | author = William Pryse-Phillips | isbn = 0-19-515938-1 | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] US | pages = 367 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9dB43SUdneUC }}</ref> He remained at the asylum until 1833, when ill health forced his resignation.<ref name = "WHO">{{cite web | url = http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1484.html | title = Achille-Louis-François Foville}}</ref>

Foville spent time travelling abroad, to [[Africa]] and [[Americas|America]].  He returned to France, settling in [[Paris]].  After the death of his former teacher Esquirol in 1840, Foville was made a [[professor]] at [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton]].  Until the appointment [[Thomas Hodgkin]] had been attempting to open a facility for the treatment of mental illnesses to compete with the [[York Retreat]].  With Foville's appointment to Charenton, he was no longer willing to relocate to England, and Hodgkin dropped the project, feeling no other doctors were suitable to run the facility.<ref name = "TSR" />  

The [[French Revolution of 1848]] cost him his job at Charenton, and Foville took up private practice in Paris. He practised medicine in Paris, treating [[mental disorders]], until 1868, when he retired.  He moved to [[Toulouse]] after his retirement, where he died in 1878.<ref name = "WHO" />

==Works==
In 1844 Foville published ''Traité complet de l'anatomie, de la physiologie et de la pathologie du système nerveux cérébro-spinal'' on the anatomy of the [[nervous system]] of the [[spinal cord]], regarded as one of the best works on the subject prior to the invention of the [[microscope]].<ref name = "TSR" />
