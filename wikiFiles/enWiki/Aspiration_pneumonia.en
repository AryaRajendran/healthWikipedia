'''Aspiration pneumonia''' is [[bronchopneumonia]] that develops due to the entrance of foreign materials into the bronchial tree,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000084148|aspiration pneumonia}}</ref> usually oral or gastric contents (including food, saliva, or nasal secretions). Depending on the acidity of the aspirate, a chemical pneumonitis can develop, and bacterial pathogens (particularly [[anaerobic bacteria]]) may add to the inflammation.

==Causes==
Aspiration pneumonia is often caused by an incompetent [[swallowing]] mechanism, such as occurs in some forms of neurological disease or injury including [[multiple sclerosis]], CVA ([[cerebrovascular accident|stroke]]) or [[Drunkenness|intoxication]]. An [[iatrogenic]] cause is during [[general anaesthesia]] for an [[Surgery|operation]] and patients are therefore instructed to be [[nil per os]] (NPO) (aka Nothing By Mouth) for at least four hours before surgery.

Whether aspiration pneumonia represents a true bacterial infection or a chemical inflammatory process remains the subject of significant controversy. Both causes may present with similar symptoms.

===Implicated bacteria===
When bacteria are implicated, they are usually of the aerobic:
*[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
*[[Staphylococcus aureus]]<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
*[[Haemophilus influenzae]]<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
*[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]<ref name=Kumar13-7/>

They may also be admixed with anaerobic bacteria [[oral flora]]:
*[[Bacteroides]]<ref name=Kumar13-7>Table 13-7 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>
*[[Prevotella]]<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
*[[Fusobacterium]]<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
*[[Peptostreptococcus]]<ref name=Kumar13-7/>

==Location==
The location is often gravity dependent, and depends on the patient position. Generally the right middle and lower lung lobes are the most common sites of infiltrate formation due to the larger caliber and more vertical orientation of the right mainstem bronchus. Patients who aspirate while standing can have bilateral lower lung lobe infiltrates. The right upper lobe is a common area of consolidation in alcoholics who aspirate in the prone position.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic464.htm | title = eMedicine.com: Pneumonia, Aspiration'' | author = Anand Swaminathan, MD}} Retrieved: 2007-01-20</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Aspiration pneumonia is typically diagnosed by a combination of clinical circumstances (debilitated or neurologically impaired patient), radiologic findings (right lower lobe pneumonia) and microbiologic cultures. Some cases of aspiration pneumonia are caused by aspiration of food particles or other particulate substances like pill fragments; these can be diagnosed by pathologists on lung biopsy specimens.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay S, Katzenstein AL |title=Pulmonary disease due to aspiration of food and other particulate matter: a clinicopathologic study of 59 cases diagnosed on biopsy or resection specimens. |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=752&ndash;759 |year=2007 |pmid=17460460 |doi= 10.1097/01.pas.0000213418.08009.f9|url=}}</ref>
