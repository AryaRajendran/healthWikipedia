'''Anti-NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) receptor encephalitis''' is an acute form of [[encephalitis]], potentially lethal but with high probability for recovery, caused by [[autoimmune]] reaction against NR1- and NR2-subunits of the glutamate [[NMDA receptor]].<!--

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is often initially misdiagnosed as a psychiatric condition.  Patients can often look manic or exhibit frank psychosis.  A lumbar puncture can help make the distinction, as most cases will show an elevated white blood cell count in the spinal fluid.  Other clinical features can include seizures and progression to a state similar to catatonia.

--> Different descriptions and syndromal designations for this disease existed in the medical literature prior to 2007, when the cause was established and it received its current name.<!--

--> The disease is associated with tumours, mostly [[teratoma]]s of the ovaries, and thus is considered a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]. However, there are a substantial number of cases with no detectable cancerous tissue.  

According to a review of 100 cases in ''[[The Lancet]]'',<!--

--> 91 of the 100 patients were women, mean age of all patients numbered 23 years (5-76 range); of the 98 patients that underwent an oncological screening, 58 had a tumour, predominantly an ovarian teratoma. All patients presented with psychiatric symptoms or memory problems; 76 of them suffered from seizures, 88 developed unresponsiveness (decreased consciousness), 86 - dyskinesias, 69 - autonomic instability, and 66 - hypoventilation. Tumour treatment associated with better prognosis; 75 patients got well without residual problems and 25 died or were left with severe deficits.
