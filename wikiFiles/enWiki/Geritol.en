'''Geritol''' is a US trademarked name for various dietary supplements, past and present.<ref>[http://www.lohas.com/articles/67234.html "SmithKline Beecham Publishes Geritol Protection Trademark,"] ''LOHAS Weekly Newsletter'', September 01, 1999</ref>  Geritol is a brand name for several vitamin complexes plus iron or multimineral products in both liquid form and tablets, containing from 9.5 to 18&nbsp;mg of iron per daily dose.<ref>[http://www.geritol.com/information.aspx "Geritol Complete Information"], GlaxoSmithKline, official Geritol information site for U.S. residents, 2008. accessed online 9 May 2008.</ref>  The name conveys a connection with aging, as in "[[geriatrics|geriatric]]." The product has been promoted from almost the beginning of the [[mass media]] era as a cure for "[[iron]]-poor tired [[blood]]".  In the early 20th century, some [[medical doctor]]s and other health professionals felt that much of the tiredness often associated with old age was due to iron deficiency [[anemia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==History==
Geritol was introduced as an alcohol-based, [[Human iron metabolism|iron]] and [[B vitamins|B vitamin]] tonic by Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in August 1950 and primarily marketed as such into the 1970s. Geritol was folded into Pharmaceuticals' 1957 acquisition of J. B. Williams Co., founded in 1885.<ref>[http://www.lib.uconn.edu/online/research/speclib/ASC/findaids/JBWilliams/MSS19670001.html J. B. Williams Company Records], 1853–1956. Archives & Special Collections, Thomas J. Dodd Center, University of Connecticut.</ref> J. B. Williams Co. was later bought out by [[Nabisco]] in 1971. The Geritol product name was formerly owned by the multinational pharmaceutical firm [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. Geritol was acquired by Meda Pharmaceutical in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=GSK launches new Alli spots, hands five OTC brands to Meda|url=http://www.mmm-online.com/gsk-launches-new-alli-spots-hands-five-otc-brands-to-meda/article/193721/}}</ref>
The earlier Geritol liquid formulation was advertised as "twice the iron in a pound of calf's liver," and daily doses contained about 50–100&nbsp;mg of iron as [[ferric ammonium citrate]]. The Geritol tonic also contained about 12% alcohol and some B vitamins.

==Federal Trade Commission investigation==
Geritol was the subject of years of investigation starting in 1959 by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). In 1965, the FTC ordered the makers of Geritol to disclose that Geritol would relieve symptoms of tiredness only in persons who suffer from [[iron deficiency anemia]], and that the vast majority of people who experience such symptoms do not have such a deficiency.  Geritol's claims were discredited in court findings as "conduct amounted to [[gross negligence]] and bordered on recklessness," ruled as a false and misleading claim, and heavily penalized with fines totaling $812,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|812000|1973|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}}, the largest FTC fine up to that date (1973).<ref name="time">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906840,00.html "Geritol's Bitter Pill"] , ''Time'', Feb. 5, 1973</ref><ref>[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/old/F2/381/381.F2d.884.16969_1.html 381 F.2d 884], "The J. B. WILLIAMS COMPANY, Inc., and Parkson Advertising Agency, Inc., Petitioner, v. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION", Respondent. No. 16969.  ''United States Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit.'' Aug. 11, 1967.</ref> Although subsequent trials and appeals from 1965 to 1973 concluded some of the FTC demands exceeded its authority, Geritol was already well known and continued to be the largest American company selling iron and B vitamin supplement through 1979. 

Since then, supplemental iron products, including Geritol, have been contraindicated because of concerns over [[hemochromatosis]],<ref>[http://egov.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/cdsummary/1997/ohd4616.pdf "HEMOCHROMATOSIS: A COMMON (YET PREVENTABLE) CHRONIC DISEASE"], ''CD Summary'', Vol. 46, No. 16.

==Media sponsorship==
In the early days of [[television]], the marketing of Geritol was involved in the [[quiz show scandal]], as the sponsor of ''[[Twenty One (game show)|Twenty-One]]''. For many years after that, Geritol was largely marketed on television programs that appealed primarily to older viewers, such as ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'', and  ''[[Original Amateur Hour|Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour]]''. Geritol was often used in the 1960s as a [[punch line]] for a joke in sitcoms or in comedy routines; comic singer [[Allan Sherman]] satirized Geritol on his 1962 album ''[[My Son, the Folk Singer]]'', singing "Yasha got a bottle of Geritol" to the tune of "Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho". Geritol is famous for a controversial 1973 television commercial tag line, "My wife, I think I'll keep her."<ref name="time"/> This line, brought out during the height of the [[Women's Liberation Movement]], was not appreciated by some women and was lambasted by the media and comedy shows alike.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
