The '''effects of high altitude on humans''' are considerable. The percentage saturation of [[hemoglobin]] with oxygen determines the content of oxygen in our blood. After the [[human body]] reaches around 2,100 m (7,000 feet) above sea level, the saturation of [[oxyhemoglobin]] begins to plummet.<ref name=BordenHuman>{{cite book |last1=Young|first1=Andrew J|last2=Reeves|first2=John T. |chapter=Human Adaptation to High Terrestrial Altitude|title=Medical Aspects of Harsh Environments |volume=2 |location=Borden Institute |place=Washington, DC |year=2002 |chapterurl=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.175.3270&rep=rep1&type=pdf|url=http://www.usariem.army.mil/Pages/download/harshenvironmentsvol2.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-05 }}</ref> However, the human body has both short-term and [[high-altitude adaptation in humans|long-term adaptations]] to altitude that allow it to partially compensate for the lack of oxygen. Athletes use these adaptations to help their performance. There is a limit to the level of adaptation; mountaineers refer to the altitudes above {{convert|8000|m|ft|sigfig=2}} as the "death zone", where no human body can acclimatize.

==Effects as a function of altitude==

The human body performs best at [[sea level]], where the [[atmospheric pressure]] is 101,325 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] or 1013.25 [[bar (unit)|millibars]] (or 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], by definition). The [[Atmospheric chemistry|concentration of oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) in sea-level air is 20.9%, so the [[partial pressure]] of O<sub>2</sub> (pO<sub>2</sub>) is 21.136 kPa. In healthy individuals, this saturates hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding red pigment in [[red blood cells]].<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>

Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude while the O<sub>2</sub> fraction remains constant to about 100&nbsp;km, so pO<sub>2</sub> decreases exponentially with altitude as well. It is about half of its sea-level value at {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the altitude of the [[Everest Base Camp]], and only a third at {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the summit of [[Mount Everest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7d.html|title=Introduction to the Atmosphere|work=PhysicalGeography.net|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> When pO<sub>2</sub> drops, the body responds with [[#Acclimatization to altitude|altitude acclimatization]].<ref name=Acclimatization>{{cite journal |last1=Muza|first1=SR|last2=Fulco|first2=CS|last3=Cymerman|first3=A |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide |journal=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=[[USARIEM|USARIEM–TN–04–05]] |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=2009-03-05 }}</ref>

===Death zone===
[[File:Everest kalapatthar crop.jpg|thumb|right|The summit of Mount Everest is in the death zone]]
Finally, the death zone, in [[mountaineering]], refers to [[altitude]]s above a certain point where the amount of [[oxygen]] is not high enough to sustain [[human]] life. This point is generally tagged as {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} [less than 356 millibars of atmospheric pressure].<ref name="PBS">{{cite web

Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly (loss of vital functions) or indirectly (wrong decisions made under stress, physical weakening leading to accidents).
In the death zone, no human body can acclimatize. An extended stay in the zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions, loss of consciousness and, ultimately, death.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ed|last=Darack|title=Wild winds: adventures in the highest Andes|page=153|year=2002|url=http://books.google.com/?id=z2WPzJHpfLEC&pg=RA1-PA153&dq=%22death+zone%22#v=onepage&q=%22death%20zone%22&f=false|isbn=978-1-884980-81-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/18/3115.abstract|title=Limits to human performance: elevated risks on high mountains|first=Raymond B.|last=Huey|coauthors=Xavier Eguskitza|date=2 July 2001|journal=J.

===Long-term effects===
{{Main|High-altitude adaptation in humans}}
One hundred and forty million people live at altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}}. Studies have found that these populations, especially people living in the [[Andes]] and in the [[Himalaya]]s, have ways of compensating for the lower oxygen levels that are different from people living at sea level. Compared with acclimatized newcomers, native Andean and Himalayan populations have better oxygenation at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for exercise. Tibetans demonstrate a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow, lower hemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to [[chronic mountain sickness]] (CMS) than other high altitude populations. These adaptations may reflect their longer history of high altitude habitation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=LG|last2=Niermeyer|first2=S|last3=Zamudio|first3=S|year=1998|title=Human adaptation to high altitude: Regional and life-cycle perspectives|journal=Am.

The correlation between elevation and suicide risk was present even when the researchers control for known suicide risk factors, including age, gender, race and income. Research also indicates that oxygen levels are unlikely to be a factor, considering that there is no indication of increased [[mood disturbance]]s at high altitude in those with [[sleep apnea]] or in heavy smokers at high altitude. The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far.<ref name=Brenner/>

==Acclimatization to altitude==
The human body can adapt to high altitude through immediate and long-term acclimatization. At high altitude, in the short term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the [[carotid bodies]], which causes an increase in the breathing rate ([[hyperventilation]]). However, hyperventilation also causes the adverse effect of [[respiratory alkalosis]], inhibiting the [[respiratory center]] from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease.<ref name=BordenHuman/><ref name=harris/>

In addition, at high altitude, the [[increase in heart rate|heart beats faster]]; the [[stroke volume]] is slightly decreased; and non-essential bodily functions are suppressed, resulting in a decline in food digestion efficiency (as the body suppresses the [[digestive system]] in favor of increasing its cardiopulmonary reserves).<ref>{{cite journal | last =Westerterp | first =Klaas | authorlink = | title =Energy and Water Balance at High Altitude | journal =News in Physiological Sciences | volume =16 | issue =3 | pages =134–7 | pmid =11443234 | url =http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/16/3/134.full | accessdate = | quote = | date = June 1, 2001 }}</ref>

Full acclimatization, however, requires days or even weeks. Gradually, the body compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days at any given altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as [[acetazolamide]].<ref name=harris>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/768478-overview|work=eMedicine Specialties > Emergency Medicine > Environmental|title=Altitude Illness – Cerebral Syndromes|first1=N Stuart|last1=Harris|first2=Sara W|last2=Nelson|date=16 Apr 2008}}</ref> Eventually, the body has lower [[lactic acid|lactate]] production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased [[Blood plasma|plasma]] volume, increased [[hematocrit]] ([[polycythemia]]), increased [[Red blood cell|RBC]] mass, a higher concentration of [[capillaries]] in [[skeletal muscle]] tissue, increased [[myoglobin]], increased [[mitochondria]], increased [[Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] enzyme concentration, increase in [[2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-BPG]], [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]], and [[right ventricular hypertrophy]].<ref name=BordenHuman/> Pulmonary artery pressure increases in an effort to oxygenate more blood.

Full hematological adaptation to high altitude is achieved when the increase of red blood cells reaches a plateau and stops. The length of full hematological adaptation can be approximated by multiplying the altitude in kilometers by 11.4 days. For example, to adapt to {{convert|4000|m|ft}} of altitude would require 45.6 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zubieta-Calleja|first=G. R.|coauthors=Paulev, P-E., Zubieta-Calleja, L.

==Altitude and athletic performance==
{{Main|Altitude training}}

For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure means there is less resistance from the atmosphere and the athlete's performance will generally be better at high altitude.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ward-Smith|year=1983|title=The influence of aerodynamic and biomechanical factors on long jump performance|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=16|number=8|pages=655–8|doi=10.1016/0021-9290(83)90116-1|pmid=6643537|first1=AJ|issue=8}}</ref> For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more), the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen, which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletics Federations ([[IAAF]]), for example, have ruled that performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1,000 metres will not be approved for record purposes.

Athletes can also take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance.<ref name=Acclimatization/> The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. However, this may not always be the case. Any positive acclimatization effects may be negated by a de-training effect as the athletes are usually not able to exercise with as much intensity at high altitudes compared to sea level.

This conundrum led to the development of the altitude training modality known as "Live-High, Train-Low", whereby the athlete spends many hours a day resting and sleeping at one (high) altitude, but performs a significant portion of their training, possibly all of it, at another (lower) altitude. A series of studies conducted in Utah in the late 1990s by researchers Ben Levine, Jim Stray-Gundersen, and others, showed significant performance gains in athletes who followed such a protocol for several weeks.<ref name="pmid9216951">{{Cite journal |last1=Levine|first1=BD|last2=Stray-Gundersen|first2=J |title="Living high-training low": effect of moderate-altitude acclimatization with low-altitude training on performance |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=102–12 |date=July 1997|pmid=9216951 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/83/1/102.long |accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref><ref name="pmid11509506">{{Cite journal |last1=Stray-Gundersen |first1=J|last2=Chapman|first2=RF|last3=Levine|first3=BD |title="Living high-training low" altitude training improves sea level performance in male and female elite runners |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=1113–20 |date=September 2001|pmid=11509506 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/91/3/1113.long |accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref> Other studies have shown performance gains from merely performing some exercising sessions at high altitude, yet living at sea level.<ref name="pmid16540709">{{Cite journal |last=Dufour|first=SP|coauthors=Ponsot E, Zoll J, Doutreleau S, Lonsdorfer-Wolf E, Geny B, Lampert E, Flück M, Hoppeler H, Billat V, Mettauer B, Richard R, Lonsdorfer J. |title=Exercise training in normobaric hypoxia in endurance runners.
