The '''[[dopamine]] hypothesis of schizophrenia''' or the '''dopamine hypothesis of psychosis''' is a model attributing symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] (like [[psychosis|psychoses]]) to a disturbed and hyperactive dopaminergic [[signal transduction]]. The model draws evidence from the observation that a large number of [[antipsychotic]]s have dopamine-[[receptor antagonist]]ic effects. The theory, however, does not posit dopamine overabundance as a complete explanation for schizophrenia. Rather, the overactivation of D2 receptors, specifically, is one effect of the global chemical synaptic disregulation observed in this disorder.

== Introduction ==

Some researchers have suggested that dopamine systems in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] may contribute to the 'positive symptoms' of schizophrenia (whereas problems with dopamine function in the [[mesocortical pathway]] may be responsible for the 'negative symptoms', such as [[avolition]] and [[alogia]].) Abnormal expression, thus distribution of the D<sub>2</sub> receptor between these areas and the rest of the brain may also be implicated in schizophrenia, specifically in the acute phase. A relative excess of these receptors within the limbic system means [[Broca's area]] which can produce illogical language, has an abnormal connection to [[Wernicke's area]], which comprehends language, but does not create it. Note that variation in distribution is observed within individuals, so abnormalities of this characteristic likely play a significant role in all psychological illnesses. Individual alterations are produced by differences within glutamatergic pathways within the limbic system, which are also implicated in other psychotic syndromes. Among the alterations of both synaptic and global structure, the most significant abnormalities are observed in the [[uncinate fasciculus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=McIntosh AM Maniega SM Lymer GK McKirdy J Hall J Sussman JE Bastin ME Clayden JD et al. |year=2008 |title= White matter tractography in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=1088-1092}}</ref> and the [[cingulate cortex]].<ref name=Haznedar>{{cite journal |author=Haznedar MM Buchsbaum MS Hazletta EA Shihabuddina L Newa A Sieverasa LJ |year=2004 |title=Cingulate gyrus volume and metabolism in the schizophrenia spectrum |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=71 |pages=249-262}}</ref> The combination these creates a profound dyssymmetry of prefrontal inhibitory signaling, shifted positively towards the dominant side.

As such, spontaneous language from Broca's can propagate through the limbic system to the tertiary auditory cortex. This retrograde signaling to the temporal lobes, results in the parietal lobes not recognizing it as internal, resulting in the auditory hallucinations typical of chronic schizophrenia.<ref>Friston KJ The disconnection hypothesis, 1998</ref>

In addition, significant cortical grey matter volume reductions are observed in this disorder. Specifically, the right hemisphere atrophies more, while both sides show a marked decrease in frontal and posterior volume.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harvey I Ron MA Du Boulay G Wicks D Lewis SW Murray RM |year=1993 |title=Reduction of cortical volume in schizophrenia on magnetic resonance imaging |journal=Psychological Medicine}}</ref>  This indicates abnormal synaptic plasticity occurs, where certain feedback loops become so potentiated, others receive little glutaminergic transmission. This is a direct result of the abnormal dopaminergic input to the striatum, thus (indirectly) disinhibition of thalamic activity. The excitatory nature of dopaminergic transmission means the [[glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia]] is inextricably intertwined with this altered functioning. Also, 5-HT, which regulates a wide variety of monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic transmission. Specifically, 5-HT2A regulates cortical input to the basal ganglia. Many typical and atypical antipsychotics are antagonists at this receptor, as well as 5-HT2C, which is expressed in many parts of the basal ganglia (striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amydygalia,and the hippocampus, all structures indicated in this disease). 5-HT2C also regulates dopamine release in response to dopaminerigic drugs as well. More research is needed to explain the exact nature of the altered chemical transmission in this disorder.

This latter work implies that there are multiple genes and neuronal pathways that can lead to psychosis and that all these multiple psychosis pathways converge via the high-affinity state of the [[D2 receptor]], the common target for all antipsychotics, typical or atypical.

=== Evidence for the dopamine hypothesis ===

[[Amphetamine]], [[cocaine]] and similar drugs increase levels of dopamine in the brain and can cause symptoms which resemble those present in psychosis, particularly after large doses or prolonged use. This is often referred to as "[[amphetamine psychosis]]" or "cocaine psychosis," but may produce experiences virtually indistinguishable from the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Similarly, those treated with dopamine enhancing [[levodopa]] for [[Parkinson's disease]] can experience psychotic side effects mimicking the symptoms of schizophrenia. Up to 75% of patients with schizophrenia have increased signs and symptoms of their psychosis upon challenge with moderate doses of [[methylphenidate]] or [[amphetamine]] or other dopamine-like compounds, all given at doses at which control normal volunteers do not have any psychologically disturbing effects.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF00216006}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|15339823}}</ref> 

Some [[functional neuroimaging]] studies have also shown that, after taking amphetamine, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia show greater levels of dopamine release (particularly in the [[striatum]]) than non-psychotic individuals. However, the acute effects of dopamine stimulants include euphoria, alertness and over-confidence; these symptoms are more reminiscent of mania than schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite pmid|3726006}}</ref>

A group of drugs called the [[phenothiazine]]s, including [[antipsychotic]]s such as [[chlorpromazine]], has been found to [[Receptor antagonist|antagonize]] dopamine binding (particularly at [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] known as [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptors]]) and reduce positive psychotic symptoms. This observation was subsequently extended to other antipsychotic drug classes, such as [[butyrophenone]]s including [[haloperidol]]. The link was strengthened by experiments in 1970s which suggested that the binding affinity of antipsychotic drugs for D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptors seemed to be inversely proportional to their therapeutic dose. This correlation, suggesting that receptor binding is causally related to therapeutic potency, was reported by two laboratories in 1976.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Creese I, Burt DR, Snyder SH |title=Dopamine receptor binding predicts clinical and pharmacological potencies of antischizophrenic drugs |journal=Science |volume=192 |issue=4238 |pages=481–3 |year=1976 |month=April |pmid=3854 |doi= 10.1126/science.3854|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3854|bibcode = 1976Sci...192..481C }}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/261717a0}}</ref>

[[genetics|Genetic]] evidence has suggested that there may be [[gene]]s, or specific variants of genes, that code for mechanisms involved in dopamine function, which may be more prevalent in people experiencing psychosis or diagnosed with schizophrenia. Dopamine related genes linked to psychosis in this way include [[COMT]], [[dopamine receptor D4|DRD4]], and [[AKT1]].<ref name="pmid18497888">{{cite pmid|18497888}}</ref>

Schizophrenics appear to have a high rate of [[Schizophrenia_and_smoking#Biological_theories|self-medication with nicotine]]; the therapeutic effect likely occurs through dopamine modulation by [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s.

=== Evidence against the dopamine hypothesis ===

Further experiments, conducted as new methods were developed (particularly the ability to use [[Positron Emission Tomography|PET]] scanning to examine drug action in the brain of living patients) challenged the view that the amount of dopamine blocking was correlated with clinical benefit. These studies showed that some patients had over 90% of their D<sub>2</sub> receptors blocked by antipsychotic drugs, but showed little reduction in their psychoses. This primarily occurs in patients who have had the psychosis for ten to thirty years. At least 90-95% of first-episode patients, however, respond to antipsychotics at low doses and do so with D<sub>2</sub> occupancy of 60-70%. The antipsychotic [[aripiprazole]] occupies over 90% of D<sub>2</sub> receptors, but this drug is both an [[agonist]] and an [[antagonist]] at D<sub>2</sub> receptors.

Furthermore, although dopamine-inhibiting medications modify dopamine levels within minutes, the associated improvement in patient symptoms is usually not visible for at least several days, suggesting that dopamine may be indirectly responsible for the illness.<ref>R. Thompson, ''The Brain'', ISBN 0-7167-1462-0</ref>

Similarly, a new generation of antipsychotic drugs (called the [[atypical antipsychotic]]s) were found to be just as effective as older [[typical antipsychotic]] drugs in controlling psychosis, but more effective in controlling the negative symptoms, despite the fact that they have lower affinity for dopamine receptors than for various other neurotransmitter receptors.<ref>Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996.</ref> More recent work, however, has shown that atypical antipsychotic drugs such as [[clozapine]] and [[quetiapine]] bind and unbind rapidly and repeatedly to the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/sj.npp.1301305}}</ref> All of these drugs exhibit inverse agonistic effects at the 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors, meaning serotonin abnormalities are also involved in the complex constellation of neurologic factors predisposing one to the self reinforcing language-based psychological deficits found in all forms of psychosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams J Spurlock G McGuffin P Mallet J Nöthen MM Gill M Aschauer H et al. |year=1996 |title=Association between schizophrenia and T102C polymorphism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a-receptor gene.

The excitatory neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] is now also thought to be associated with schizophrenia. [[Phencyclidine]] (also known as PCP or "Angel Dust") and [[ketamine]], both of which block glutamate ([[NMDA]]) receptors, are known to cause psychosis at least somewhat resembling schizophrenia, further suggesting that psychosis and perhaps schizophrenia cannot fully be explained in terms of dopamine function, but may also involve other neurotransmitters.<ref>"Daring to Think Differently about Schizophrenia".  New York Times, February 24, 2008. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/business/24drug.html?_r=1&ei=5087&em=&en=6a0e8fe7296833ff&ex=1204002000&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin.</ref>

Similarly, there is now evidence to suggest there may be a number of functional and structural anomalies in the brains of some people diagnosed with schizophrenia, such as changes in [[grey matter]] density in the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[temporal lobe]]s.<ref name="See2">{{cite pmid|15716360}}</ref> It appears, therefore, that there are multiple causes for psychosis and schizophrenia, including gene mutations and anatomical lesions.

Psychiatrist [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] has argued that drug companies have inappropriately promoted  the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia as a deliberate and calculated simplification for the benefit of drug marketing.
