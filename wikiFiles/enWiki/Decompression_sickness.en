'''Decompression sickness''' ('''DCS'''; also known as '''divers' disease''', '''the bends''' or '''caisson disease''') describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to a specific type of [[Diving hazards and precautions|underwater diving hazard]] but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] working, flying in unpressurised aircraft, and [[extra-vehicular activity]] from spacecraft.

Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death. Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day, and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all. The classification of types of DCS by its symptoms has evolved since its original description over a hundred years ago.

Although DCS is not a common event, its potential severity is such that much research has gone into preventing it, and underwater divers use [[dive tables]] or [[dive computers]] to set limits on their exposure to pressure and their ascent speed. Treatment is by [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] in a [[recompression chamber]]. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.

== Classification ==
DCS is classified by symptoms. The earliest descriptions of DCS used the terms: "bends" for joint or skeletal pain; "chokes" for breathing problems; and "staggers" for neurological problems.{{sfn|Francis & Mitchell, ''Manifestations''|p=578}} In 1960, Golding ''et al.'' introduced a simpler classification using the term "Type I ('simple')" for symptoms involving only the [[skin]], [[musculoskeletal system]], or [[lymphatic system]], and "Type II ('serious')" for symptoms where other organs (such as the [[central nervous system]]) are involved.{{sfn|Francis & Mitchell, ''Manifestations''|p=578}} Type II DCS is considered more serious and usually has worse outcomes.<ref name="emed" /> This system, with minor modifications, may still be used today.{{sfn|Marx|p=1908}} Following changes to treatment methods, this classification is now much less useful in diagnosis,{{sfn|Francis & Mitchell, ''Manifestations''|p=579}} since neurological symptoms may develop after the initial presentation, and both Type I and Type II DCS have the same initial management.<ref name="Francis" />

=== Decompression illness and dysbarism ===
The term [[dysbarism]] encompasses decompression sickness, [[arterial gas embolism]], and [[barotrauma]], whereas decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism are commonly classified together as [[decompression illness]] when a precise diagnosis cannot be made.{{sfn|Francis & Mitchell, ''Manifestations''|p=580}}  DCS and arterial gas embolism are treated very similarly because they are both the result of gas bubbles in the body.<ref name="Francis" /> The U.S. Navy prescribes identical treatment for Type II DCS and arterial gas embolism.<ref name="USNDM2008" /> Their spectra of symptoms also overlap, although those from arterial gas embolism are generally more severe because they often arise from an [[infarction]] (blockage of blood supply and tissue death).

== Signs and symptoms ==
While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain ("the bends") accounts for about 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site. [[Neurological]] symptoms are present in 10% to 15% of DCS cases with [[headache]] and visual disturbances the most common symptom. Skin manifestations are present in about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS ("the chokes") is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols.{{sfn|Powell|p=71}} The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.{{sfn|Francis & Mitchell, ''Manifestations''|pp=578–584}}

Although onset of DCS can occur rapidly after a dive, in more than half of all cases symptoms do not begin to appear for at least an hour. In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The [[U.S. Navy]] and [[Technical Diving International]], a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that indicates onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.<ref name="usn520-3.1" /><ref name="TdiDpm" />
{{multicol-end}}

== Causes ==
{{further2|[[Decompression_(diving)#Bubble_formation.2C_growth_and_elimination|Bubble formation, growth and elimination]]}}
DCS is caused by a reduction in [[ambient pressure]] that results in the formation of bubbles of [[inert gases]] within tissues of the body. It may happen when leaving a high-pressure environment, ascending from depth, or ascending to altitude.

=== Ascent from depth ===
DCS is best known as a [[diving disorder]] that affects divers having breathed gas that is at a higher pressure than the surface pressure, owing to the pressure of the surrounding water. The risk of DCS increases when diving for extended periods or at greater depth, without ascending gradually and making the [[decompression stops]] needed to slowly reduce the excess pressure of inert gases dissolved in the body. The specific risk factors are not well understood and some divers may be more susceptible than others under identical conditions.<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Benton" />  DCS has been confirmed in rare cases of [[apnea|breath-holding]] divers who have made a sequence of many deep dives with short surface intervals; and it may be the cause of the disease called [[taravana]] by South Pacific island natives who for centuries have dived by breath-holding for food and [[pearl]]s.<ref name="Wong1999" />

Two principal factors control the risk of a diver suffering DCS:

# the rate and duration of gas absorption under pressure&nbsp;– the deeper or longer the dive the more gas is absorbed into body tissue in higher concentrations than normal ([[Henry's Law]]);
# the rate and duration of outgassing on depressurization&nbsp;– the faster the ascent and the shorter the interval between dives the less time there is for absorbed gas to be offloaded safely through the lungs, causing these gases to come out of solution and form "micro bubbles" in the blood.{{sfn|Lippmann & Mitchell|pp=65–66}}

Even when the change in pressure causes no immediate symptoms, rapid pressure change can cause permanent [[bone]] injury called [[dysbaric osteonecrosis]] (DON). DON can develop from a single exposure to rapid decompression.<ref name="Ohta1974" />

=== Leaving a high-pressure environment ===
[[File:Caisson Schematic.svg|thumb|300px|alt=Schematic of a caisson|The principal features of a caisson are the workspace, pressurised by an external air supply, and the access tube with an airlock]]

When a worker comes out of a pressurized [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] or out of a [[mining|mine]] that has been pressurized to keep water out, he will experience a significant reduction in [[ambient pressure]].<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Elliott" /> A similar pressure reduction occurs when an [[astronaut]] exits a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or [[extra-vehicular activity]], where the pressure in his [[spacesuit]] is lower than the pressure in the vehicle.<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Pilmanis" /><ref name="Vann2" />

The original name for DCS was "caisson disease". This term was introduced in the 19th century, when caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding large engineering excavations below the [[water table]], such as bridge supports and tunnels. Workers spending time in high ambient pressure conditions are at risk when they return to the lower pressure outside the caisson if the pressure is not reduced slowly. DCS was a major factor during construction of [[Eads Bridge]], when 15 workers died from what was then a mysterious illness, and later during construction of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], where it incapacitated the project leader [[Washington Roebling]].<ref name="Eads" />

=== Ascent to altitude ===
Passengers may be at risk of DCS when an unpressurized [[aircraft]] ascends to [[high altitude]].<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Pilmanis" /><ref name="Gerth" /> Likewise, there is increased risk for divers flying in any aircraft shortly after diving, since even in a pressurized aircraft the cabin pressure is not maintained at sea-level pressure but may drop to as low as 73% of [[sea level pressure]].<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Vann1" />

Altitude DCS became a common problem in the 1930s with the development of high-altitude balloon and aircraft flights. Today, [[cabin pressurization]] systems maintain commercial aircraft cabin pressure at the equivalent altitude of {{convert|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} or less, allowing safe flights at {{convert|12000|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more. DCS is very rare in healthy individuals who experience pressures equivalent to this altitude. However, since the pressure in the cabin is not actually maintained at sea-level pressure, there is still a risk of DCS in individuals having dived recently. Also, cabin pressurization systems [[Cabin pressurization#Loss of pressurization|fail occasionally]], and some people may be vulnerable to the drop in pressure that occurs even in pressurized aircraft.<ref name="NASA1999" /><ref name="RRR1181" />

There is no specific altitude threshold that can be considered safe for everyone and below which no one will develop altitude DCS. Nevertheless, there is very little evidence of altitude DCS occurring among healthy individuals who have not been underwater diving at [[pressure altitude]]s below {{convert|5500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The higher the altitude of exposure the greater is the risk of developing altitude DCS. Although exposures to incremental altitudes above {{convert|5500|m|ft|abbr=on}} show an incremental risk of altitude DCS, they do not show a direct relationship with the severity of the various types of DCS. Individual exposures to pressure altitudes between {{convert|5500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|7500|m|ft|abbr=on}} have shown a low occurrence of altitude DCS. A US Air Force study of altitude DCS cases reported that 87% of incidents occurred at {{convert|7500|m|ft|abbr=on}} or higher.<ref name="FAA2005" />  High altitude parachutists performing a [[HALO jump]] may develop altitude DCS if they do not flush nitrogen from the body by pre-breathing pure oxygen.<ref name="pmid14620473" />

== Predisposing factors ==
Although the occurrence of DCS is not easily predictable, many predisposing factors are known. They may be considered as either environmental or individual.

=== Environmental ===
The following environmental factors have been shown to increase the risk of DCS:

* the magnitude of the pressure reduction ratio&nbsp;– a large pressure reduction ratio is more likely to cause DCS than a small one.<ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Vann1" /><ref name="Fryer" />
* repetitive exposures&nbsp;– repetitive dives within a short period of time (a few hours) increase the risk of developing DCS. Repetitive ascents to altitudes above {{convert|5500|m|ft}} within similar short periods increase the risk of developing altitude DCS.<ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Fryer" />
* the rate of ascent&nbsp;– the faster the ascent the greater the risk of developing DCS. The US Navy Dive Manual indicates that ascent rates greater than about {{convert|20|m/min|ft/min||abbr=on}} when diving increase the chance of DCS, while recreational dive tables such as the [[Bühlmann tables]] require an ascent rate of {{convert|10|m/min|ft/min||abbr=on}} with the last {{convert|6|m|ft||abbr=on}} taking at least one minute.{{sfn|Lippmann & Mitchell|p=232}} <!-- There are some doppler bubble studies to support this --> An individual exposed to a rapid decompression (high rate of ascent) above {{convert|5500|m|ft}} has a greater risk of altitude DCS than being exposed to the same altitude but at a lower rate of ascent.<ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Fryer" />
* the duration of exposure&nbsp;– the longer the duration of the dive, the greater is the risk of DCS. Longer flights, especially to altitudes of {{convert|5500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and above, carry a greater risk of altitude DCS.<ref name="Dehart" />
* underwater diving before flying&nbsp;– divers who ascend to altitude soon after a dive increase their risk of developing DCS even if the dive itself was within the dive table safe limits. Dive tables make provisions for post-dive time at surface level before flying to allow any residual excess nitrogen to outgas. However, the pressure maintained inside even a pressurized aircraft may be as low as the pressure equivalent to an altitude of {{convert|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Therefore, the assumption that the dive table surface interval occurs at normal atmospheric pressure is invalidated by flying during that surface interval, and an otherwise-safe dive may then exceed the dive table limits.<ref name="Bassett" /><ref name="FAD" /><ref name="pmid17672177" />
* diving before travelling to altitude&nbsp;– DCS can occur without flying if the person moves to a high-altitude location on land immediately after diving, for example, scuba divers in [[Eritrea]] who drive from the coast to the [[Asmara]] plateau at {{convert|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} increase their risk of DCS.{{sfn|Lippmann & Mitchell|p=79}}
* [[Altitude diving|diving at altitude]]&nbsp;– diving in water whose surface altitude is above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} — for example, [[Lake Titicaca]] is at {{convert|3800|m|ft|abbr=on}} — without using versions of [[decompression table]]s or [[dive computer]]s that are modified for high-altitude.<ref name="Bassett" /><ref name="Egi" />

=== Individual ===
[[File:Atrial septal defect-en.png|thumb|alt=Diagram of the four chambers of the heart. There is a gap in the wall between the upper-left and upper-right chambers|Atrial septal defect (PFO) showing left-to-right shunt. A right-to-left shunt may allow bubbles to pass into the arterial circulation.]]

The following individual factors have been identified as possibly contributing to increased risk of DCS:

* [[dehydration]]&nbsp;– Studies by Walder concluded that decompression sickness could be reduced in aviators when the serum surface tension was raised by drinking isotonic saline,<ref name="Walder" /> and the high surface tension of water is generally regarded as helpful in controlling bubble size.<ref name="Fryer" /> Maintaining proper hydration is recommended.{{sfn|Lippmann & Mitchell|p=71}}
* [[patent foramen ovale]]&nbsp;– a hole between the atrial chambers of the [[heart]] in the [[fetus]] is normally closed by a flap with the first breaths at birth. In about 20% of adults the flap does not completely seal, however, allowing blood through the hole when coughing or during activities that raise chest pressure. In diving, this can allow venous blood with microbubbles of inert gas to bypass the lungs, where the bubbles would otherwise be filtered out by the lung capillary system, and return directly to the arterial system (including arteries to the brain, spinal cord and heart).<ref name="Moon" /> In the arterial system, bubbles ([[arterial gas embolism]]) are far more dangerous because they block circulation and cause [[infarction]] (tissue death, due to local loss of blood flow). In the brain, infarction results in [[stroke]], and in the spinal cord it may result in [[paralysis]].{{sfn|Lippmann & Mitchell|p=70}}
* a person's age&nbsp;– there are some reports indicating a higher risk of altitude DCS with increasing age.<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Fryer" />
* previous injury&nbsp;– there is some indication that recent joint or limb injuries may predispose individuals to developing decompression-related bubbles.<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Karlsson" />
* [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] temperature&nbsp;– there is some evidence suggesting that individual exposure to very cold ambient temperatures may increase the risk of altitude DCS.<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Fryer" /> Decompression sickness risk can be reduced by increased ambient temperature during decompression following dives in cold water.<ref name="Gerth2" />
* body type&nbsp;– typically, a person who has a high body fat content is at greater risk of DCS.<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Fryer" /> This is due to nitrogen's five times greater solubility in fat than in water, leading to greater amounts of total body dissolved nitrogen during time at pressure. Fat represents about 15–25 percent of a healthy adult's body, but stores about half of the total amount of nitrogen (about 1 litre) at normal pressures.<ref name="fatness" />
* alcohol consumption&nbsp;– although [[alcohol]] consumption increases dehydration and therefore may increase susceptibility to DCS,<ref name="Fryer" /> a 2005 study concluded that alcohol consumption did not increase the risk of DCS.<ref name="leigh2005" />

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Preparing for recompression.jpg|thumb|alt=A diver being helped out of his bulky diving gear|This surfacing diver must enter a [[decompression chamber]] to avoid decompression sickness.]]
Depressurisation causes [[inert gas]]es, which were dissolved under higher [[pressure]], to come out of physical [[solution]] and form gas [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s within the body. These bubbles produce the symptoms of decompression sickness.<ref name="38uhms" /><ref name="Ackles" /> Bubbles may form whenever the body experiences a reduction in pressure, but not all bubbles result in DCS.{{sfn|Nishi Brubakk & Eftedal|p=501}}  The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is described by [[Henry's Law]], which indicates that, when the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid is decreased, the amount of that gas dissolved in the liquid will also decrease proportionately.

On ascent from a dive, inert gas comes out of solution in a process called "[[outgassing]]" or "offgassing". Under normal conditions, most offgassing occurs by [[gas exchange]] in the [[lung]]s.<ref name="Kindwall1" /><ref name="Kindwall2" /> If inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in the lungs then bubbles may form in the blood or within the solid tissues of the body. The formation of bubbles in the skin or joints results in milder symptoms, while large numbers of bubbles in the venous blood can cause lung damage.{{sfn|Francis & Mitchell, ''Manifestations''|pp=583–584}} The most severe types of DCS interrupt — and ultimately damage — spinal cord function, leading to [[paralysis]], [[Sensory system|sensory]] dysfunction, or death. In the presence of a [[right-to-left shunt]] of the heart, such as a [[patent foramen ovale]], venous bubbles may enter the arterial system, resulting in an [[arterial gas embolism]].<ref name="Francis" />{{sfn|Francis & Mitchell, ''Pathophysiology''|pp=530–541}} A similar effect, known as [[ebullism]], may occur during [[explosive decompression]], when water vapour forms bubbles in body fluids due to a dramatic reduction in environmental pressure.<ref name="Landis" />

=== Inert gases ===
The main inert gas in air is [[nitrogen]], but nitrogen is not the only gas that can cause DCS. [[Breathing gas]] mixtures such as [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] and [[heliox]] include [[helium]], which can also cause decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause [[Nitrogen narcosis|narcosis]], it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|p=475}}
There is some debate as to the decompression requirements for helium during short-duration dives. Most divers do longer decompressions, however some groups like the [[WKPP]] have been pioneering the use of shorter decompression times by including [[decompression stops#Deep stops|deep stops]].<ref name="Wienke2002" />

Any inert gas that is breathed under pressure can form bubbles when the ambient pressure decreases. Very deep dives have been made using [[hydrogen]]-oxygen mixtures ([[Hydrox (breathing gas)|hydrox]]),<ref name="fife" /> but controlled decompression is still required to avoid DCS.<ref name="uhms33" />

=== Isobaric counterdiffusion ===
{{see|Isobaric counterdiffusion}}

DCS can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as [[isobaric counterdiffusion]], and presents a problem for very deep dives.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|p=477}} For example, after using a very helium-rich [[trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium, but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in "fast" tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect.<ref name="burton2004" />

== Diagnosis ==
Decompression sickness should be suspected if any of the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving.<ref name="ThalmannDAN" /> In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to [[Divers Alert Network]] had shown symptoms within 24 hours.<ref name="DAN1995annual" /> An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing.<ref name="MoonSPUMS98" /> The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression.<ref name="MoonSPUMS98" /><ref name="45UHMS" /> Although [[MRI]] or [[Computed tomography|CT]] can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.{{sfn|Marx|p=1908}}

== Prevention ==
=== Underwater diving ===
[[File:Aladin-pdc.jpg|thumb|alt=Close-up of the LCD display of an Aladin Pro|The display of a basic personal dive computer shows depth, dive time, and decompression information.]]
To prevent the excess formation of bubbles that can lead to decompression sickness, divers limit their ascent rate to about {{convert|10|m|ft}} per minute, and carry out a decompression schedule as necessary.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|p=471}} This schedule requires the diver to ascend to a particular depth, and remain at that depth until sufficient gas has been eliminated from the body to allow further ascent.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|p=455}} Each of these is termed a "[[decompression stop]]", and a schedule for a given bottom time and depth may contain one or more stops, or none at all. Dives that contain no decompression stops are called "no-stop dives", but divers usually schedule a short "safety stop" at {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbrev=on}}, {{convert|4.6|m|ft|abbrev=on}}, or {{convert|6|m|ft|abbrev=on}}, depending on the training agency.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|p=471}}{{efn|name=stops}}

The decompression schedule may be derived from [[decompression tables]], [[Dive tables#Alternatives|decompression software]], or from [[dive computers]], and these are commonly based upon a mathematical model of the body's uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes. These models, such as the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, are designed to fit empirical data and provide a decompression schedule for a given depth and dive duration.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|pp=456–457}}

Since divers on the surface after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any subsequent dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule to take account of the residual gas load from the previous dive. This will result in a shorter available time under water or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|pp=471–473}}<!-- need to define [[bottom time]], [[decompression obligation]], [[surface interval]] by expanding [[Dive tables]] -->

Decompression time can be significantly shortened by breathing mixtures containing much less inert gas during the decompression phase of the dive (or pure [[oxygen]] at stops in {{convert|6|m|ft}} of water or less). The reason is that the inert gas outgases at a rate proportional to the difference between the [[partial pressure]] of inert gas in the diver's body and its partial pressure in the breathing gas; whereas the likelihood of bubble formation depends on the difference between the inert gas partial pressure in the diver's body and the ambient pressure. Reduction in decompression requirements can also be gained by breathing a [[nitrox]] mix during the dive, since less nitrogen will be taken into the body than during the same dive done on air.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|pp=474–475}}

Following a decompression schedule does not completely protect against DCS. The algorithms used are designed to reduce the probability of DCS to a very low level, but do not reduce it to zero.{{sfn|Hamilton & Thalmann|p=456}}<!-- need to expand this to refer to variety of body types and other risk factors -->

=== Exposure to altitude ===
One of the most significant breakthroughs in the prevention of altitude DCS is oxygen pre-breathing.  Breathing pure oxygen significantly reduces the nitrogen loads in body tissues and, if continued without interruption, provides effective protection upon exposure to low-barometric pressure environments.<ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Pilmanis" /> However, breathing pure oxygen during flight alone (ascent, en route, descent) does not decrease the risk of altitude DCS.<ref name="Dehart" /><ref name="Pilmanis" />

Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an effective method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive for the protection of civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft.

[[Astronauts]] aboard the [[International Space Station]] preparing for [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) "camp out" at low atmospheric pressure, {{convert|10.2|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, spending eight sleeping hours in the [[Quest airlock]] chamber before their [[spacewalk]]. During the EVA they breathe 100% oxygen in their [[spacesuit]]s, which operate at {{convert|4.3|psi|bar|abbr=on}},<ref name="tanner" /> although research has examined the possibility of using 100% O<sub>2</sub> at {{convert|9.5|psi|bar|abbr=on}} in the suits to lessen the pressure reduction, and hence the risk of DCS.<ref name="webb1989" />

== Treatment ==
[[File:Nasa decompression chamber.jpg|thumb|alt=A large horizontal cylinder with a bank of instruments and monitors|The recompression chamber at the [[Neutral Buoyancy Lab]].]]
{{see|Hyperbaric medicine}}

All cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with 100% oxygen until [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (100% oxygen delivered in a high-pressure chamber) can be provided.{{sfn|Marx|p=1912}} Mild cases of the "bends" and some skin symptoms may disappear during descent from high altitude; however, it is recommended that these cases still be evaluated. Neurological symptoms, pulmonary symptoms, and mottled or marbled skin lesions should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy if seen within 10 to 14 days of development.{{sfn|Marx|p=1813}}

Recompression on air was shown to be an effective treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909.<ref name="Keays1909" /> Evidence of the effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and [[Albert R. Behnke|Behnke]],<ref name="Yarbrough1939" /> and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS.<ref name="Berghage1978" /> Recompression is normally carried out in a [[recompression chamber]]. At a dive site, a riskier alternative is [[in-water recompression]].<ref name="Edmonds1998" /><ref name="Pyle1995" /><ref name="Kay108" />

[[Oxygen first aid]] has been used as an emergency treatment for diving injuries for years.{{sfn|Moon & Gorman|p=616}} If given within the first four hours of surfacing, it increases the success of recompression therapy as well as a decrease the number of recompression treatments required.<ref name="Longphre" /> Most fully closed-circuit [[rebreather]]s can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich [[breathing gas]] and could be used as a means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available.<ref name="Goble2003" />

It is beneficial to give fluids, as this helps reduce [[dehydration]]. It is no longer recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised to do so by medical personnel, as [[analgesics]] may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the [[recovery position]] if vomiting occurs.<ref name="ThalmannDAN" /> In the past, both the [[Trendelenburg position]] and the left lateral [[decubitus position]] (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected,<ref name="O'Dowd2000" /> but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding [[cerebral edema]].{{sfn|Moon & Gorman|p=616}}<ref name="Bove2009" />

== Prognosis ==
Immediate treatment with 100% oxygen, followed by recompression in a hyperbaric chamber, will in most cases result in no long term effects. However, permanent long-term injury from DCS is possible. Three-month follow-ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed "still had residual signs and symptoms from Type II DCS and 7% from Type I DCS".<ref name="UHMS43_Bennett" /><ref name="DAN88" /> Long-term follow-ups showed similar results, with 16% having permanent neurological sequelae.<ref name="Desola1989" />

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of decompression sickness is rare, estimated at 2.8 cases per 10,000 dives, with the risk 2.6 times greater for males than females.{{sfn|Marx|p=1908}} DCS affects approximately 1,000 U.S. scuba divers per year.<ref name="ThalmannDAN" /> In 1999, the [[Divers Alert Network]] (DAN) created "Project Dive Exploration" to collect data on dive profiles and incidents. From 1998 to 2002, they recorded 50,150 dives, from which 28 recompressions were required — although these will almost certainly contain incidents of [[arterial gas embolism]] (AGE) — a rate of about 0.05%.<ref name="emed" /><ref name="pde" /><!-- The emed ref contains data on morbidity as well; add later -->

== History ==
* 1670: [[Robert Boyle]] demonstrated that a reduction in ambient pressure could lead to bubble formation in living tissue. This description of a [[Viperidae|viper]] in a [[vacuum]] was the first recorded description of decompression sickness.<ref name="acott1999-law" />
* 1769: [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] described the [[post mortem]] findings of air in [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[Circulatory system|circulation]] and surmised that this was the cause of death.<ref name="acott1999-hist" />
* 1840: [[Charles Pasley]], who was involved in the recovery of the sunken warship [[HMS Royal George (1756)|HMS Royal George]], commented that, of those having made frequent dives, "not a man escaped the repeated attacks of rheumatism and cold".{{sfn|Marx|p=1903}}
* 1841: First documented case of decompression sickness, reported by a mining engineer who observed pain and muscle cramps among [[coal miner]]s working in [[shaft mining|mine shaft]]s air-pressurized to keep water out.
* 1870: Bauer published outcomes of 25 paralyzed [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] workers.

From 1870 to 1910, all prominent features were established. Explanations at the time included: cold or exhaustion causing reflex spinal cord damage; electricity cause by [[friction]] on compression; or organ [[:wikt:congestion|congestion]]; and vascular stasis caused by decompression.<ref name="acott1999-hist" />

[[File:Eads Bridge panorama 20090119.jpg|thumb|alt=A large arch bridge with several substantial support pillars sunk into a river|The Eads Bridge where 42 workers were injured by caisson disease]]

* 1871: The [[Eads Bridge]] in [[St Louis]] employed 352 compressed air workers including Dr. [[Alphonse Jaminet]] as the physician in charge. There were 30 seriously injured and 12 fatalities. Dr. Jaminet developed decompression sickness and his personal description was the first such recorded.<ref name="Eads" />
* 1872: The similarity between decompression sickness and [[iatrogenic]] air embolism as well as the relationship between inadequate decompression and decompression sickness was noted by Friedburg. He suggested that intravascular gas was released by rapid decompression and recommended: slow compression and decompression; four-hour working shifts; limit to maximum depth 44.1 [[Pounds per square inch|psig]] (4 [[Atmosphere (unit)|ATA]]); using only healthy workers; and recompression treatment for severe cases.
* 1873: Dr. Andrew Smith first utilized the term "caisson disease" describing 110 cases of decompression sickness as the physician in charge during construction of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].<ref name="Eads" /><ref name="Brooklyn" /> The project employed 600 compressed air workers. Recompression treatment was not used. The project chief engineer [[Washington Roebling]] suffered from caisson disease.<ref name="Eads" /> (He took charge after his father [[John Augustus Roebling]] died of [[tetanus]].) Washington's wife, Emily, helped manage the construction of the bridge after his sickness confined him to his home in [[Brooklyn]]. He battled the after-effects of the disease for the rest of his life. During this project, decompression sickness became known as "The [Grecian] Bends" because afflicted individuals characteristically arched their backs: this is possibly reminiscent of a then fashionable women's dance maneuver known as the [[Grecian bend|Grecian Bend]], or as historian David McCullough asserts in ''The Great Bridge'' it was a crude reference to "Greek" or anal sex.<ref name="McCullogh" />
* 1900: [[Leonard Erskine Hill|Leonard Hill]] used a frog model to prove that decompression causes bubbles and that recompression resolves them.<ref name="acott1999-hist" /><ref name="Hill1912" /> Hill advocated linear or uniform [[Dive profile|decompression profiles]].<ref name="acott1999-hist" /><ref name="Hill1912" /> This type of decompression is used today by [[Saturation diving|saturation divers]]. His work was financed by [[Augustus Siebe]] and the [[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman Company]].<ref name="acott1999-hist" />

[[File:Early diving recompression chamber at Broome, Western Australia.jpg|thumb|alt=A horizontal cylinder, just large enough to contain one person, with an hinged door clamp at one end|An early recompression chamber]]

* 1908: "The Prevention of Compressed Air Illness" was published by [[John Scott Haldane|JS Haldane]], Boycott and Damant recommending [[Decompression stop|staged decompression]].<ref name="Boycott" /> These tables were accepted for use by the Royal Navy.<ref name="acott1999-hist" />
* 1916: The decompression chamber was invented by the Italian engineer [[Alberto Gianni]].<ref>Seventy fathom deep - David Scott - Faber & Faber limited London 1931</ref><ref>The Egypt gold - David Scott - Faber & Faber London 1932</ref>
* 1924: The US Navy published the first standardized recompression procedure.<ref name="USNrecompression" />
* 1930s: [[Albert R Behnke]] separated the symptoms of Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE) from those of DCS.<ref name="acott1999-hist" /><!-- still looking for primary reference for precise date. Couldn't find it at http://archives.mc.duke.edu/uhmsbehnke_html -->
* 1935: Behnke ''et al.'' experimented with oxygen for recompression therapy.<ref name="acott1999-hist" /><ref name="USNrecompression" /><ref name="Behnke1935" />
* 1937: Behnke introduced the “no-stop” decompression tables.<ref name="acott1999-hist" />
* 1941: Altitude DCS is treated with hyperbaric oxygen for the first time.<ref name="pmid889546" />
* 1957: Robert Workman established a new method for calculation of decompression requirements (M-values).<ref name="Workman57" />
* 1959: The "SOS Decompression Meter", a submersible mechanical device that simulated nitrogen uptake and release, was introduced.<ref name="Carson" /><!-- I'll look for a better source, maybe some magazine article -->
* 1960: FC Golding ''et al.'' split the classification of DCS into Type 1 and 2.<ref name="pmid13850667" />
* 1982: Paul K Weathersby, Louis D Homer and Edward T Flynn introduce [[survival analysis]] into the study of decompression sickness.<ref name="pmid6490468" />
* 1983: Orca produced the "EDGE", a personal dive computer, using a [[microprocessor]] to calculate nitrogen absorption for twelve tissue compartments.<ref name="Carson" />
* 1984: [[Albert A Bühlmann]] released his book "Decompression-Decompression Sickness," which detailed his [[Bühlmann decompression algorithm|deterministic model]] for calculation of decompression schedules.<ref name="buhlmann1984" />

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
In the United States, it is common for [[medical insurance]] not to cover treatment for the bends that is the result of recreational diving. This is because scuba diving is considered an elective and "high-risk" activity and treatment for decompression sickness is expensive. A typical stay in a recompression chamber will easily cost several thousand dollars, even before emergency transportation is included. As a result, groups such as [[Divers Alert Network]] (DAN) offer medical insurance policies that specifically cover all aspects of treatment for decompression sickness at rates of less than $100 per year.<ref name="DANinsurance" />

In the United Kingdom, treatment of DCS is provided by the National Health Service, either at a specialised facility or at a ''Hyperbaric Centre'' based within a general hospital.<ref name="LondonHyp" />

| [[Isobaric counterdiffusion|Inner ear counter diffusion]] is a rare form of DCS sometimes experienced by divers engaged in [[Deep diving#Ultra-deep diving|extreme deep diving]], caused by helium being released from the tissues but blocked by heavier nitrogen molecules. Two of the best-recorded instances of it both occurred at [[Boesmansgat]], South Africa&nbsp;— once to [[Nuno Gomes (diver)|Nuno Gomes]] in an early world record attempt, and later to [[Don Shirley (diver)|Don Shirley]] when he tried to rescue [[David Shaw (diver)|David Shaw]] on his fateful dive trying to recover the body of [[Deon Dreyer]], who had been one of Gomes's support divers.
