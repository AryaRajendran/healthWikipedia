==Controversy==
Oz has faced criticism in the past due to his tendency to feature [[pseudoscience]] and other controversial subjects.

===Arsenic in apple juice===
In September 2011, Oz drew criticism for a show focusing on the dangers of arsenic in apple juice. Oz hired an independent toxicology laboratory, EMSL, and found arsenic levels in some samples to be above the limit U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) allows in drinking water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/arsenic-apple-juice |title=Arsenic in apple juice - Dr Oz's extensive national investigation |publisher=Doctoroz.com |date=2011-09-09 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> A school district took apple juice off its menu after the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/news/20110915/7206/apple-juice-arsenic-levels-controvery-dr-oz.htm |title=School District Pulls Apple Juice from Menu after Dr. Oz Report on Arsenic (Medical Daily, Sept. 15, 2011) |publisher=Medicaldaily.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> The FDA said "there is currently no evidence to suggest a public health risk".<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20106763-10391704.html Apple juice safe despite arsenic, FDA tells Dr. Oz ([[CBS News]], Sept. 15, 2011) ]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/DietNutrition/28528 |title=FDA Slams 'Dr. Oz' for Apple Juice Report (MedPage Today, Sept. 15, 2011) |publisher=Medpagetoday.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/dr-richard-besser-dr-mehmet-oz-debate-arsenic/story?id=14526426 Apple Juice Showdown: Dr. Oz Arsenic Claim Questioned by Dr. Besser ([[ABC News]], Sept. 15, 2011)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/dr-oz-answers-your-questions-about-arsenic-apple-juice |title=Dr. Oz Answers Your Questions About Arsenic in Apple Juice &#124; The Dr. Oz Show |publisher=Doctoroz.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> Further testing conducted by Consumer Reports however, confirmed the findings of Dr Oz that inorganic arsenic levels were indeed above the levels allowed by the FDA for drinking water.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Atlantic Wire |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/dr-oz-vindicated-new-study-finds-high-arsenic-levels-in-apple-juice/249331/ |title=Dr. Oz Vindicated: New Study Finds High Arsenic Levels in Apple Juice |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref>

===Real Age drug marketing===
Oz is a spokesman and advisor for the website [[RealAge]].com, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' has criticized for its pharmaceutical marketing practices.  The site solicits medical information from visitors to determine a visitor’s biological age and then uses the visitor's medical profile for pharmaceutical marketing purposes. As ''The Times'' reporter explained the significance of this fact: "While few people would fill out a detailed questionnaire about their health and hand it over to a drug company looking for suggestions for new medications, that is essentially what RealAge is doing."<ref>{{cite news |title=Online Age Quiz Is a Window for Drug Makers |author=Stephanie Clifford |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/technology/internet/26privacy.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref>

===Reparative therapy of homosexuals===
An episode of ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'' that aired on November 28, 2012, was devoted to the  "reparative therapy".  Advocates of this practice view [[homosexuality]]  as an illness or mental health problem that can be "cured", even though homosexuality does not appear in any of the current medical diagnostic manuals for illness or mental health conditions, such as [[DSM-IV-TR]].  On the contrary, in response to "reparative therapy" advocacy, several mainstream medical and psychological organizations formed the "Just the Facts Coalition", and published a booklet explicitly opposing "reparative therapy" because, in the medical opinion of these organizations, homosexuality is not an illness.  Thus, this episode of Dr. Oz presented information in direct conflict with the opinions of the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and others.<ref>{{cite book|title=Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation and Youth: a Primer for Principals, Educators, and School Personnel|year=2008|publisher=Just the Facts Coalition|page=5|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts.pdf}}</ref>  The broadcast featured a representative of NARTH (The National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality), Julie Hamilton, PhD.  Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender ([[LGBT]]) advocacy groups strongly condemned Oz for allowing anyone who defended reparative therapy to appear on his program.  Oz wrote on his blog that he "felt they needed to include all parties [in a discussion]" but agreed with established medical consensus that the data does not support any positive results. The statements by Oz seemed to do little to appease members of the LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/dr-oz-reparative-ex-gay-therapy-backlash-_n_2211621.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices |title=Dr. Oz's Reparative Or 'Ex-Gay' Episode Prompts Backlash From GLAAD, PFLAG And GLSEN |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>
