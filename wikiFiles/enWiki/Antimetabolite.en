An '''antimetabolite''' is a chemical that [[enzyme inhibition|inhibits]] the use of a [[metabolite]], which is another chemical that is part of normal [[metabolism]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith, A. L. |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |pages=43 |isbn=0-19-854768-4}}</ref> Such substances are often similar in structure to the metabolite that they interfere with, such as the [[antifolate]]s that interfere with the use of [[folic acid]]. The presence of antimetabolites can have toxic effects on cells, such as halting [[cell growth]] and [[cell division]], so these compounds are used as [[chemotherapy]] for cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0163-7258(00)00086-3 |author=Peters GJ, van der Wilt CL, van Moorsel CJ, Kroep JR, Bergman AM, Ackland SP |title=Basis for effective combination cancer chemotherapy with antimetabolites |journal=Pharmacol.

==Function==
===Cancer treatment===
Antimetabolites can be used in [[cancer]] treatment,<ref>{{MeshName|Antineoplastic+Antimetabolites}}</ref> as they interfere with DNA production and therefore cell division and the growth of tumors. Because cancer cells spend more time dividing than other cells, inhibiting cell division harms tumor cells more than other cells.

Anti-metabolites masquerade as a [[purine]] ([[azathioprine]], [[mercaptopurine]]) or a [[pyrimidine]], chemicals that become the building-blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the [[S phase]] (of the [[cell cycle]]), stopping normal development and division.<ref>Takimoto CH, Calvo E. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 "Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> 

They also affect RNA synthesis. However, because [[thymidine]] is used in DNA but not in RNA (where [[uracil]] is used instead), inhibition of thymidine synthesis via [[thymidylate synthase]] selectively inhibits DNA synthesis over RNA synthesis.

Due to their efficiency, these drugs are the most widely used [[cytostatic]]s.

In the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System|ATC system]], they are classified under [[ATC code L01#L01B Antimetabolites|L01B]].

===Antibiotics===
Antimetabolites may also be [[antibiotics]], such as [[sulfanilamide]] drugs, which inhibit [[dihydrofolate]] synthesis in bacteria by competing with [[para-aminobenzoic acid]].<ref>"The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action" (2nd edition), R. B. Silverman, 2004.</ref>
