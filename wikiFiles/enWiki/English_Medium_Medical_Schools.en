Circa 2006, the Chinese Government instituted the admission of foreign students to China for Medical instruction utilizing English as the language of instruction. Students are eligible to earn basic degrees in either Medicine ([[MBBS]]) or Dentistry ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]]).

To ensure adequate quality control, only a few choice medical schools are allowed specific quotas for admitting international students into these programs. Other Chinese medical institutions are not barred from admitting international students, but the government maintains that these other students would have to be admitted into the Medical programs taught in Chinese. <ref>[http://202.205.177.9/english/tongzhi_070810.htm Interim provisions for Quality Control Standards on Undergraduate Medical Education in English for International Students in China]</ref> 
This list of universities is reviewed each year, and currently stands at 50 schools. 

These schools are thus officially recognized by both the [[Avicenna_Directories | WHO]] and the [[Ministry_of_Education_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China| MOE]].
