==Characteristics==
The appearance of affected individuals is abnormal. They exhibit growth retardation, short stature, premature graying of hair,[[alopecia]] (hair loss), [[wrinkle|wrinkling]], prematurely aged face with a [[Aquiline nose|beaked nose]], skin [[atrophy]] (wasting away) with [[scleroderma]]-like [[lesion]]s, [[lipodystrophy]] (loss of fat tissues), abnormal fat deposition leading to thin legs and arms, and severe [[ulcer]]ations around the [[Achilles tendon]] and [[Malleolus|malleoli]] (around ankles). Other medical signs include change in voice (weak, hoarse, high-pitched), atrophy of [[gonad]]s leading to reduced [[fertility]], [[Cataract|bilateral cataract]] (clouding of lens),  premature [[arteriosclerosis]] (thickening and loss of elasticity of arteries), [[calcinosis]] (calcium deposits in blood vessels),[[atherosclerosis]] (blockage of blood vessels), [[type 2 diabetes]], [[osteoporosis]] (loss of bone mass), [[telangiectasia]], and [[malignancy|malignancies]].<ref name="Navarro" /><ref name="Doiscience" /> In fact, the prevalence of rare cancers, such as meningiomas, are increased in individuals with Werner syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=8722214|year=1996|last1=Goto|first1=M|last2=Miller|first2=RW|last3=Ishikawa|first3=Y|last4=Sugano|first4=H|title=Excess of rare cancers in Werner syndrome (adult progeria)|volume=5|issue=4|pages=239–46|journal=Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology}}</ref>

==Causes==
Approximately 90% of individuals presenting Werner syndrome have any of a range of mutations in the eponymous gene, ''[[Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase|WRN]]''; the only gene currently attributed to cause Werner syndrome.<ref name="Leis" /><ref name="ncbi" /> ''WRN'', which lies on [[chromosome 8]] in humans,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1741060 |year=1992 |month=Feb |author=Goto M, Rubenstein M, Weber J, Woods K, Drayna D |title=Genetic linkage of Werner's syndrome to five markers on chromosome 8 |volume=355 |issue=6362 |pages=735–8|doi=10.1038/355735a0 |journal=Nature}}</ref> encodes the WRNp protein, a 1432 amino acid protein with a central domain resembling members of the RecQ helicases. WRNp is active in unwinding DNA, a step necessary in DNA repair and [[DNA replication]].<ref name="Doing" /><ref name="ghr" /> Since WRNp's function depends on DNA, it is only functional when localized to the nucleus.

Mutations which cause Werner syndrome all occur at the regions of the gene which encode for protein, and not at non-coding regions.<ref name="Pmid_b">{{cite journal|pmid=16673358|year=2006|last1=Huang|first1=S|last2=Lee|first2=L|last3=Hanson|first3=NB|last4=Lenaerts|first4=C|last5=Hoehn|first5=H|last6=Poot|first6=M|last7=Rubin|first7=CD|last8=Chen|first8=DF|last9=Yang|first9=CC|title=The spectrum of WRN mutations in Werner syndrome patients|volume=27|issue=6|pages=558–67|doi=10.1002/humu.20337|pmc=1868417|journal=Human mutation}}</ref> These mutations can have a range of effects. They may decrease the stability of the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which increases the rate at which they are degraded. With less mRNA, less is available to be [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into the WRNp protein. Mutations may also lead to the truncation (shortening) of the WRNp protein leading to the loss of its [[Nuclear localization sequence|nuclear localization signal sequence]], thus it is no longer transported into the nucleus where it interacts with the DNA. This leads to a reduction in DNA repair.<ref name="Pmid_b" /> Furthermore, mutated proteins are more likely to be degraded than normal WRNp.<ref name="ghr" /> Apart from causing defects in DNA repair, its aberrant association with p53 down-regulates the function of p53, leading to a reduction in p53-dependent apoptosis and increase the survival of these disfunctional cells.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10364153|year=1999|last1=Spillare|first1=EA|last2=Robles|first2=AI|last3=Wang|first3=XW|last4=Shen|first4=JC|last5=Yu|first5=CE|last6=Schellenberg|first6=GD|last7=Harris|first7=CC|title=P53-mediated apoptosis is attenuated in Werner syndrome cells|volume=13|issue=11|pages=1355–60|pmc=316776|journal=Genes & development|doi=10.1101/gad.13.11.1355}}</ref>

==Treatment==
In 2010, [[vitamin C]] supplementation was found to reverse the premature aging and several tissue dysfunctions in a genetically modified mouse model of the disease.  Vitamin C supplementation also appeared to normalize several age-related molecular markers such as the increased levels of the transcription factor [[NF-κB]]. Vitamin C decreases activity of genes activated in human Werner syndrome, and increases gene activity involved in tissue repair.<ref name="Massip" /> Vitamin C supplementation is suspected to be beneficial in the treatment of human Werner syndrome, although there was no evidence of anti-aging activity in nonmutant mice.<ref name="Massip">{{cite journal

==Popular culture==
On the episode "Stargazer in a Puddle" from the series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', the victim had Werner syndrome.

Werner syndrome was featured in the film ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]], in which his character aged four times faster than normal.

In an early cut scene from the game ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'', Hal "Otacon" Emmerich cites "classic Werner syndrome" as the most likely cause of [[Solid Snake]]'s premature aging, though he goes on to say that testing had been inconclusive.

In season 3 episode 9, "[[The Ballad of Kevin and Tess]]", of TV show ''[[The 4400]]'', Kevin is said to have Werner syndrome to hide his real condition from the public.

In ''[[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)]]'' season 1 episode 6, "Impetus", the new character Gloria has an experimentally altered type of Werner syndrome that causes it to become contagious.
