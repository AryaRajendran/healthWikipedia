Whether or not [[obesity]] should be considered a disease on its own, it is also an important [[risk factor]] for many chronic physical and mental illnesses.<ref name=WHOPDF/> The generally accepted view is that being overweight causes similar health problems to obesity, but to a lesser degree.

===High blood pressure===
More than 85% of those with [[hypertension]] have a BMI greater than 25.<ref name=HaslamJames/>  The risk of hypertension is 5 times higher in the [[obese]] as compared to those of normal weight.  A definitive link between obesity and hypertension has been found using animal and clinical studies, which have suggested that there are multiple potential mechanisms for obesity-induced hypertension.  These mechanisms include the activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] as well as the activation of the [[renin-angiotensin system|renin–angiotensin-aldosterone system]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rahmouni K, Correia ML, Haynes WG, Mark AL |title=Obesity-associated hypertension: new insights into mechanisms |journal=Hypertension |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15583075 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000151325.83008.b4 |url=}}</ref>

===Diabetes mellitus===
One of the strongest links between obesity and disease is that with [[type 2 diabetes]].  These two conditions are so strongly linked that researchers in the 1970s started calling it “diabesity”.<ref name=HaslamJames/>  Excess weight is behind 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.<ref name=Kopelman2005>{{cite book|author=Peter G.

===Infertility===
Obesity leads to infertility in both men and women.
