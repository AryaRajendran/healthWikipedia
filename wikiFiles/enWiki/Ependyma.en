'''Ependyma''' is the thin [[Epithelium|epithelial membrane]] lining the [[ventricular system]] of the [[brain]] and the [[spinal cord]].  Ependyma is one of the four types of [[neuroglia]] in the [[central nervous system]]. It is involved in the production of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).

==Ependymal Cells==
The ependyma is made up of ependymal cells, ependymocytes.  These are the [[epithelial-like]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that line the CSF-filled [[Ventricular system|ventricle]]s in the brain and the [[central canal]] of the spinal cord.  The cells are ciliated simple cuboidal epithelium-like cells.  Their [[apical surface]]s are covered in a layer of [[cilia]], which circulate CSF around the central nervous system.  Their apical surfaces are also covered with [[microvilli]], which absorb CSF.  Ependymal cells are a type of [[Glial cell]] and are also CSF producing cells. Within the brain's ventricles, a population of modified ependymal cells and capillaries together form a system called the [[choroid plexus]], which produces the CSF.

Modified tight junctions between ependymal cells control fluid release across the epithelium.  This release allows free exchange between CSF and nervous tissue of brain and spinal cord.  This is why sampling of CSF (e.g. through a "spinal tap") gives one window to the Central Nervous System (CNS).

The basal membrane of these cells are characterized by tentacles like extensions that attach to astrocytes.

==Pathology==
[[Ependymoma]] is a tumor of the ependymal cells most commonly found in 4th ventricle.

==Stem cells==
Jonas Frisén and his colleagues at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in [[Stockholm]] provided evidence that ependymal cells act as reservoir cells in the forebrain, which can be activated after stroke and as in vivo and in vitro stem cells in the spinal cord.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Johansson CB, Momma S, Clarke DL, Risling M, Lendahl U, Frisen J | title = Identification of a neural stem cell in the adult mammalian central nervous system | journal = Cell | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–34 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9989494 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80956-3}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal | author = Carlén M, Meletis K, Göritz C, Darsalia V, Evergren E, Tanigaki K, Amendola M,

==Ependyma and Neurodegeneration==

In 2004, Dr. Milan Radojicic proposed the '''stem cell niche disruption hypothesis''', highlighting the role of local ischemia, cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and cytotoxic factors in disrupting the ependymal stromal epithelium, along with periependymal stem/progenitor cells, thereby tipping the balance between injury and self-repair (i.e., neurogenesis and gliogenesis) in the central nervous system toward further degeneration over time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
