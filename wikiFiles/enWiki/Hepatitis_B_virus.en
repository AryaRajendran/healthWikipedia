==Classification==
The hepatitis B virus is classified as the type species of the ''[[Orthohepadnavirus]]'', which contains three other species: the ''Ground squirrel hepatitis virus'', ''Woodchuck hepatitis virus'', and the ''Woolly monkey hepatitis B virus''. The genus is classified as part of the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'' family, which contains two other genera, the ''[[Avihepadnavirus]]'' and a second which has yet to be assigned. This family of viruses have not been assigned to a viral order.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fs_hepad.htm | title=00.030.

The virus is divided into four major [[serotype]]s (adr, adw, ayr, ayw) based on antigenic [[epitope]]s present on its envelope proteins, and into eight genotypes (A-H) according to overall nucleotide sequence variation of the genome. The genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution and are used in tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus.

==Evolution==

The early evolution of the Hepatitis B, like that of all viruses, is difficult to establish.
 
The  divergence of orthohepadnavirus and avihepadnavirus occurred ~125,000 years ago (95% interval 78,297–313,500).<ref name=van_Hemert2011>{{cite journal |author=van Hemert FJ, van de Klundert MA, Lukashov VV, Kootstra NA, Berkhout B, Zaaijer HL |title=Protein X of hepatitis B virus: origin and structure similarity with the central domain of DNA glycosylase |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=8 |page=e23392 |year=2011 |pmid=21850270 |pmc=3153941 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023392 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023392}}</ref> Both the Avihepadnavirus and Orthohepadna viruses began to diversify about 25,000 years ago.<ref name=van_Hemert2011>{{cite journal | author = van Hemert FJ, de Klundert MA, Lukashov VV, Kootstra NA, Berkhout B, Zaaijer HL | year = 2011 | title = Protein x of hepatitis B virus: origin and structure similarity with the central domain of DNA glycosylase | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e23392 }}</ref> The branching at this time lead to the emergence of the Orthohepadna genotypes A-H.

The Avihepadnavirus lack a X protein but a vestigial X reading frame is present in the genome of duck hepadnavirus.<ref name=Lin2000>{{cite journal |author=Lin B, Anderson DA |title=A vestigial X open reading frame in duck hepatitis B virus |journal=Intervirology |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=185–90 |year=2000 |pmid=11044813 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=25037&typ=pdf}}</ref> The X protein may have evolved from a [[DNA glycosylase]].

The rate of nonsynonymous mutations in this virus has been estimated to be about 2×10<sup>−5</sup> amino acid replacements per site per year.<ref name=Osiowy2006>{{cite journal |author=Osiowy C, Giles E, Tanaka Y, Mizokami M, Minuk GY |title=Molecular evolution of hepatitis B virus over 25 years |journal=J.

==Genome==
[[Image:HBV_Genome.svg|thumb|The genome organisation of HBV. The genes overlap.]]
===Size===
The [[genome]] of HBV is made of circular [[DNA]], but it is unusual because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand is linked to the viral [[DNA polymerase]]. The genome is 3020–3320 [[nucleotide]]s long (for the full length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length strand).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kay A, Zoulim F |title=Hepatitis B virus genetic variability and evolution |journal=Virus Res. |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=164–76 |year=2007 |pmid=17383765 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.021}}</ref>

===Encoding===
The negative-sense, (non-coding), is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (-) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (-)sense strand and the ends are rejoined.

There are four known genes encoded by the genome called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. The DNA polymerase is encoded by gene P. Gene S is the gene that codes for the surface antigen (HBsAg). The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame "start" (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large, middle, and small (pre-S1 + pre-S2 + S, pre-S2 + S, or S) are produced.<ref name="pmid17206754">{{cite journal |author=Beck J, Nassal M |title=Hepatitis B virus replication |journal=World J.

The genotypes differ by at least 8% of the sequence and have distinct geographical distributions and this has been associated with anthropological history. Type F which diverges from the other genomes by 14% is the most divergent type known. Type A is prevalent in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[South-east Asia]], including the [[Philippines]]. Type B and C are predominant in [[Asia]]; type D is common in the Mediterranean area, the [[Middle East]] and [[India]]; type E is localized in sub-Saharan Africa; type F (or H) is restricted to Central and [[South America]]. Type G has been found in [[France]] and [[Germany]]. Genotypes A, D and F are predominant in [[Brazil]] and all genotypes occur in the [[United States]] with frequencies dependent on ethnicity.

The E and F strains appear to have originated in aboriginal populations of Africa and the New World, respectively.

Within genotypes 24 subtypes have been described which differ by 4-8% of the genome.

Type A has two subtypes: Aa (A1) in Africa/Asia and the Philippines and Ae (A2) in Europe/United States.

Type B  has two distinct geographical distributions: Bj/B1 ('j' — Japan) and Ba/B2 ('a' — Asia). Type Ba has been further subdivided into four clades (B2 — B4).

Type C has two geographically subtypes: Cs (C1) in South-east Asia and Ce (C2) in East Asia. The C subtypes have been divided into five clades (C1 — C5).

Among South Amerindians only F3 was found. Subtypes Ia, III, and IV exhibit a restricted geographic distribution (Central America, the North and the South of South America respectively) while clades Ib and II are found in all the Americas except in the Northern South America and North America respectively.

==Life cycle==
[[Image:HBV replication.png|right|thumb|Hepatitis B virus replication .]]

The life cycle of hepatitis B virus is complex. Hepatitis B is one of a few known [[retrovirus|non-retroviral]] viruses which use [[reverse transcription]] as a part of its replication process.

; Attachment : The virus gains entry into the cell by binding to a receptor on the surface of the cell and enters it by [[endocytosis]]. The cell surface receptor has been identified as the [[NTCP]] sodium/bile acid transporter.
; Penetration : The virus membrane then fuses with the host cell's membrane releasing the DNA and core proteins into the cytoplasm.
; Uncoating : Because the virus multiplies via RNA made by a host enzyme, the viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by host proteins called chaperones. The core proteins dissociate from the partially double stranded viral DNA is then made fully double stranded and transformed into covalently closed circular DNA ([[cccDNA]]) that serves as a template for transcription of four viral [[mRNA]]s.
; Replication : The largest mRNA, (which is longer than the viral genome), is used to make the new copies of the genome and to make the [[capsid]] core protein and the viral [[DNA polymerase]].
; Assembly : These four viral transcripts undergo additional processing and go on to form progeny virions which are released from the cell or returned to the nucleus and re-cycled to produce even more copies.<ref name="pmid17206754"/><ref name="pmid17206755">{{cite journal |author=Bruss V |title=Hepatitis B virus morphogenesis |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=65–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17206755 |doi=}}</ref>
; Release : The long mRNA is then transported back to the cytoplasm where the virion P protein synthesizes DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity.
