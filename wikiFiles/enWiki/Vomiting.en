'''Vomiting ''' (known medically as '''emesis''' and informally as '''throwing up''' and numerous other terms) is the forceful expulsion of the contents of one's [[stomach]] through the [[mouth]] and sometimes the [[Human nose|nose]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=830 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Vomiting can be caused by a wide variety of conditions; it may present as a specific response to ailments like [[gastritis]] or [[poison]]ing, or as a non-specific [[sequela]] of disorders ranging from [[brain tumor]]s and elevated [[intracranial pressure]] to overexposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. The feeling that one is about to vomit is called [[nausea]], which often precedes, but does not always lead to, vomiting. [[Antiemetic]]s are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where [[dehydration]] develops, [[intravenous]] fluid may be required.

Vomiting is different from [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]], although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Regurgitation is the return of undigested food back up the [[esophagus]] to the [[mouth]], without the force and displeasure associated with vomiting. The causes of vomiting and regurgitation are generally different.

==Complications==
===Aspiration of vomit ===
Vomiting can be dangerous if the gastric content enters the [[respiratory tract]]. Under normal circumstances the [[gag reflex]] and [[coughing]] prevent this from occurring, however these protective reflexes are compromised in persons under the influences of certain substances such as [[ethanol|alcohol]] or [[anesthesia]]. The individual may choke and [[asphyxiation|asphyxiate]] or suffer an [[aspiration pneumonia]].

=== Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance ===
Prolonged and excessive vomiting depletes the body of water (dehydration), and may alter the electrolyte status. Gastric vomiting leads to the loss of acid (protons) and chloride directly. Combined with the resulting [[alkaline tide]], this leads to [[hypochloremia|hypochloremic]] [[metabolic alkalosis]] (low [[chloride]] levels together with high [[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>]] and CO<sub>2</sub> and increased blood [[pH]]) and often [[hypokalemia]] ([[potassium]] depletion). The hypokalemia is an indirect result of the [[kidney]] compensating for the loss of acid. With the loss of intake of food the individual may eventually become [[cachexia|cachectic]]. A less frequent occurrence results from a vomiting of intestinal contents, including bile acids and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, which can cause [[metabolic acidosis]].

===Mallory-Weiss tear===
Repeated or profuse vomiting may cause erosions to the [[esophagus]] or small tears in the esophageal mucosa ([[Mallory-Weiss tear]]). This may become apparent if fresh red blood is mixed with vomit after several episodes.

===Dentistry===
Recurrent vomiting, such as observed in [[bulimia nervosa]], may lead to destruction of the [[tooth enamel]] due to the acidity of the vomit. [[Digestive enzymes]] can also have a negative effect on oral health, by degrading the tissue of the [[gums]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:49-aspetti di vita quotidiana, vomito,Taccuino Sanitatis, Ca.jpg|thumb|14th century illustration of vomiting from the Casanatense [[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]|alt=A Renaissance drawing with vivid colours depicting a woman holding the head of a man, who is bent over and expelling a brownish-red material from his mouth. A second woman stands at the left of the image in the doorway to the room, and appears to offer support. A crude representation of vomiting.]]
Receptors on the floor of the [[fourth ventricle]] of the brain represent a [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]], known as the [[area postrema]], stimulation of which can lead to vomiting. The area postrema is a [[circumventricular organ]] and as such lies outside the [[blood–brain barrier]]; it can therefore be stimulated by blood-borne drugs that can [[Vomiting#Emetics|stimulate vomiting]] or [[Antiemetics|inhibit it]].

There are various sources of input to the vomiting center:
* The chemoreceptor trigger zone at the base of the fourth ventricle has numerous [[dopamine receptors|dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors]], [[5-HT receptor|serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors]], [[opioid receptor]]s, [[acetylcholine receptor]]s, and receptors for [[substance P]]. Stimulation of different receptors are involved in different pathways leading to emesis, in the final common pathway substance P appears involved.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hornby | first1 = PJ | title = Central neurocircuitry associated with emesis | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 111 Suppl 8A | pages = 106S–112S | year = 2001 | pmid = 11749934 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(01)00849-X | issue = 8}}</ref>
* The [[vestibular system]], which sends information to the brain via [[cranial nerve VIII]] (vestibulocochlear nerve), plays a major role in [[motion sickness]], and is rich in [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptors]] and [[histamine receptor|histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors]].
* The [[vagus nerve|Cranial nerve X]] (vagus nerve) is activated when the [[pharynx]] is irritated, leading to a [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]].
* The Vagal and [[enteric nervous system]] inputs transmit information regarding the state of the [[gastrointestinal system]]. Irritation of the GI mucosa by chemotherapy, radiation, distention, or acute infectious [[gastroenteritis]] activates the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors of these inputs.
* The [[Central nervous system|CNS]] mediates vomiting that arises from psychiatric disorders and stress from higher brain centers.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ray Andrew P., Chebolu Seetha, Ramirez Juan, Darmani Nissar A | year = 2009 | title = Ablation of Least Shrew Central Neurokinin NK1 Receptors Reduces GR73632-Induced Vomiting | url = | journal = Behavioural Neuroscience | volume = 123 | issue = 3| pages = 701–706 | doi = 10.1037/a0015733 }}</ref>

The vomiting act encompasses three types of outputs initiated by the chemoreceptor trigger zone: Motor, [[parasympathetic nervous system]] (PNS), and [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS). They are as follows:

* Increased [[saliva]]tion to protect [[tooth enamel]] from stomach acids. (Excessive vomiting leads to [[Erosion (dental)|dental erosion]]). This is part of the PNS output.
* The body takes a deep breath to avoid [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirating]] vomit.
* [[Retroperistalsis]], starts from the middle of the [[small intestine]] and sweeps up digestive tract contents into the stomach, through the relaxed [[pylorus|pyloric sphincter]].
* Intrathoracic pressure lowers (by [[Inhalation|inspiration]] against a closed [[glottis]]), coupled with an increase in abdominal pressure as the [[abdomen|abdominal muscles]] contract, propels stomach contents into the [[esophagus]] as the [[cardia|lower esophageal sphincter]] relaxes. The stomach itself does not contract in the process of vomiting except for at the [[Angular incisure|angular notch]], nor is there any retroperistalsis in the esophagus.
* Vomiting is ordinarily preceded by [[retching]].
* Vomiting also initiates an [[Sympathetic nervous system|SNS]] response causing both sweating and increased heart rate.

The [[neurotransmitter]]s that regulate vomiting are poorly understood, but inhibitors of [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[serotonin]] are all used to suppress vomiting, suggesting that these play a role in the initiation or maintenance of a vomiting cycle. [[Vasopressin]] and [[neurokinin]] may also participate.

=== Phases ===

The vomiting act has two phases.  In the retching phase, the abdominal muscles undergo a few rounds of coordinated contractions together with the diaphragm and the muscles used in respiratory inspiration. For this reason, an individual may confuse this phase with an episode of violent [[hiccups]]. In this retching phase nothing has yet been expelled. In the next phase, also termed the expulsive phase, intense pressure is formed in the stomach brought about by enormous shifts in both the diaphragm and the abdomen.  These shifts are, in essence, vigorous contractions of these muscles that last for extended periods of time - much longer than a normal period of muscular contraction.  The pressure is then suddenly released when the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes resulting in the expulsion of gastric contents. Individuals who do not regularly exercise their abdominal muscles may experience pain in those muscles for a few days. The relief of pressure and the release of endorphins into the bloodstream after the expulsion causes the vomiter to feel better.

===Contents===
[[Gastric acid|Gastric secretions]] and likewise vomit are highly [[acid]]ic. Recent food intake appears in the gastric vomit. Irrespective of the content, vomit tends to be [[odor|malodorous]].

The content of the ''vomitus'' (vomit) may be of medical interest. Fresh [[blood]] in the vomit is termed [[hematemesis]] ("blood vomiting"). Altered blood bears resemblance to coffee grounds (as the [[iron]] in the blood is [[oxidation|oxidized]]) and, when this matter is identified, the term "[[coffee ground vomiting]]" is used. [[Bile]] can enter the vomit during subsequent heaves due to [[duodenum|duodenal]] contraction if the vomiting is severe. Fecal vomiting is often a consequence of [[intestinal obstruction]] or a gastrocolic [[fistula]] and is treated as a warning sign of this potentially serious problem ("signum mali ominis").

If the vomiting reflex continues for an extended period with no appreciable vomitus, the condition is known as ''non-productive emesis'' or ''dry heaves'', which can be painful and debilitating.

;Color of vomit
*Bright red in the vomit suggests bleeding from the esophagus
*Dark red vomit with liver-like clots suggests profuse bleeding in the stomach, such as from a perforated ulcer
*Coffee ground-like vomit suggests less severe bleeding in the stomach, because the gastric acid has had time to change the composition of the blood
*Yellow vomit suggests bile. This indicates that the [[pyloric valve]] is open and bile is flowing into the stomach from the duodenum. (This is more common in older people.)

==Differential diagnosis==
Vomiting may be due to a large number of causes, and protracted vomiting has a long [[differential diagnosis]].

===Digestive tract===
Causes in the [[digestive tract]]
* [[Gastritis]] (inflammation of the gastric wall)
* [[Gastroenteritis]]
* [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]]
* [[Pyloric stenosis]] (in babies, this typically causes a very forceful "projectile vomiting" and is an indication for urgent surgery)
* [[Bowel obstruction]]
* [[Overeating]]
* [[Acute abdomen]] and/or [[peritonitis]]
* [[Ileus]]
* Food allergies (often in conjunction with hives or swelling)
* [[Cholecystitis]], [[pancreatitis]], [[appendicitis]], [[hepatitis]]
* [[Food poisoning]]
* In children, it can be caused by an allergic reaction to cow's milk proteins (Milk allergy or [[lactose intolerance]])

===Sensory system and brain===
Causes in the [[sensory system]]
* Movement: [[motion sickness]] (which is caused by overstimulation of the labyrinthine canals of the ear)
* [[Ménière's disease]]

Causes in the brain
* [[Concussion]]
* [[Cerebral hemorrhage]]
* [[Migraine]]
* [[Brain tumor]]s, which can cause the chemoreceptors to malfunction
* [[Benign intracranial hypertension]] and [[hydrocephalus]]

Metabolic disturbances (these may irritate both the stomach and the parts of the brain that coordinate vomiting)
* [[Hypercalcemia]] (high [[calcium in biology|calcium]] levels)
* [[Uremia]] ([[urea]] accumulation, usually due to [[renal failure]])
* [[Adrenal insufficiency]]
* [[Hypoglycemia]]
* [[Hyperglycemia]]

Pregnancy
* [[Hyperemesis gravidarum|Hyperemesis]], [[Morning sickness]]

Drug reaction (vomiting may occur as an acute [[somatic]] response to)
* [[alcohol]] (being sick while being [[drunkenness|drunk]] or being sick the next morning, suffering from the after-effects, i.e., the [[hangover]]).
* [[opioid]]s
* [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]
* many [[chemotherapy]] drugs
* some [[entheogen]]s (such as [[peyote]] or [[ayahuasca]])

Illness (sometimes colloquially known as "stomach flu"—a broad name that refers to gastric inflammation caused by a range of viruses and bacteria.)
* [[Norovirus]] (Formerly Norwalk virus or Norwalk agent)
* [[Swine Flu]]

===Emetics===
An ''emetic'', such as [[syrup of ipecac]], is a substance that induces vomiting when administered orally or by injection. An emetic is used medically where a substance has been ingested and must be expelled from the body immediately (for this reason, many toxic and easily digestible products such as rat poison contain an emetic).  Inducing vomiting can remove the substance before it is absorbed into the body.  Ipecac abuse can cause detrimental health effects.

[[Salt]] water and [[Mustard seed|mustard]] water have been used since ancient times as emetics.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.3109/15563657108990490 | last1 = Decker | first1 = W.

[[Copper sulfate]] was also used in the past as an emetic.<ref name="pmid4385403">{{cite journal |author=Holtzmann NA, Haslam RH |title=Elevation of serum copper following copper sulfate as an emetic |journal=Pediatrics |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=189–93 |year=1968 |month=July |pmid=4385403 |doi= |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/1/189}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = S.

Hydrogen peroxide is used as an [[emetic]] in veterinary practice.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Drugs to Control or Stimulate Vomiting|encyclopedia=Merck Veterinary manual|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/190303.htm|publisher=[[Merck & Co.]], Inc|year=2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.petplace.com/dogs/how-to-induce-vomiting-emesis-in-dogs/page1.aspx How to Induce Vomiting (Emesis) in Dogs]</ref>

===Social cues===
It is quite common that, when one person vomits, others nearby become nauseated, particularly when smelling the vomit of others, often to the point of vomiting themselves. It is believed that this is an [[evolution|evolved]] trait among [[primates]]. Many primates in the wild tend to browse for food in small groups. Should one member of the party react adversely to some ingested food, it may be advantageous (in a survival sense) for other members of the party to also vomit. This tendency in human populations has been observed at drinking parties, where excessive consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s may cause a number of party members to vomit nearly simultaneously, this being triggered by the initial vomiting of a single member of the party. This phenomenon has been touched on in popular culture: Notorious instances appear in the films ''[[Mr Creosote|Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983) and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' (1986).<ref>[http://www.screenjunkies.com/general/9-best-vomit-scenes-film 9 Best Vomit Scenes On Film], screenjunkies.com</ref>

Intense vomiting in [[ayahuasca]] [[ceremony|ceremonies]] is a common phenomenon. However, people who experience "la purga" after drinking ayahuasca, in general, regard the practice as both a physical and spiritual cleanse and often come to welcome it.<ref>Shanon, B. (2002). The antipodes of the mind: Charting the phenomenology of the ayahuasca experience. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> It has been suggested that the consistent emetic effects of ayahuasca — in addition to its many other therapeutic properties — was of medicinal benefit to [[indigenous people]]s of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], in helping to clear [[parasite]]s from the gastrointestinal system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Andritzky | first1 = W. | year = 1989 | title = Sociopsychotherapeutic functions of ayahuasca healing in Amazonia | url = | journal = Journal of Psychoactive Drugs | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 77–89 | pmid = 2656954 | doi=10.1080/02791072.1989.10472145}}</ref>

There have also been documented cases of a single ill and vomiting individual inadvertently causing others to vomit, when they are especially fearful of also becoming ill, through a form of [[mass hysteria]].

Most people try to contain their vomit by vomiting into a sink, toilet, or trash can, as vomit is difficult and unpleasant to clean. On airplanes and boats, special bags are supplied for sick passengers to vomit into. A special disposable bag (leakproof, puncture-resistant, odorless) containing absorbent material that solidifies the vomit quickly is also available, making it convenient and safe to store until there is an opportunity to dispose of it conveniently.

People who vomit chronically (e.g., as part of an [[eating disorder]] such as [[bulimia nervosa]]) may devise various ways to hide this disorder.

An online study of people's responses to "horrible sounds" found vomiting "the most disgusting." Professor Cox of the [[University of Salford]]'s Acoustic Research Centre said that "We are pre-programmed to be repulsed by horrible things such as vomiting, as it is fundamental to staying alive to avoid nasty stuff." It is thought that disgust is triggered by the sound of vomiting to protect those nearby from, possibly diseased, food.<ref>[http://www.salford.ac.uk/news/details/462 Sickening sounds - research to make your ears cringe]{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}. [[University of Salford]]. January 28, 2007.</ref>

* Self-induced
** [[Eating disorders]] ([[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]])
** To eliminate an ingested poison (some poisons should not be vomited as they may be more toxic when inhaled or aspirated; it is better to ask for help before inducing vomiting)

==Other types==
'''Fecal vomiting''' (aka '''stercoraceous''' vomiting<ref name=med_dict>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/vomiting</ref>) is a kind of vomiting, or emesis, in which partially or fully digested matter is expelled from the [[intestines]] into the [[stomach]], by a combination of liquid and gas pressure and spasmodic contractions of the gastric muscles, and then subsequently forcefully expelled from the stomach up into the [[esophagus]] and out through the mouth and sometimes [[nasal passage]]s. Though it is not usually [[fecal]] matter that is expelled{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, it smells noxious. Alternative medical terms for fecal vomiting are ''copremesis'' and ''stercoraceous vomiting''.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fecal+vomiting fecal vomiting - definition of fecal vomiting in the Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Copremesis like all emesis may lead to aspiration. However, if contents of the large intestine are aspirated, severe or even fatal [[aspiration pneumonia]] results, secondary to the massive number of bacteria normally present distal to the ileocecal valve. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
'''Projectile vomiting''' refers to vomiting that ejects the gastric contents with great force.<ref name=med_dict /> It is a classic symptom of [[infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis]], in which it typically follows feeding and can be so forceful that some material exits through the nose.<ref name=Sleisenger783>{{cite book|last=Sleisenger|first=edited by Mark Feldman, Lawrence S.

==Treatment==
An [[antiemetic]] is a [[medication|drug]] that is effective against vomiting and [[nausea]]. Antiemetics are typically used to treat [[motion sickness]] and the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] of medications such as [[opioid]]s and [[chemotherapy]].

Antiemetics act by inhibiting the receptor sites associated with emesis. Hence, anticholinergics, antihistamines, dopamine antagonists, serotonin antagonists, and cannabinoids are used as anti-emetics.

==Epidemiology==
[[Nausea]] and/or vomiting are the main complaints in 1.6% of visits to family physicians in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helena Britt |last2=Fahridin |first2=S |title=Presentations of nausea and vomiting |journal=Aust Fam Physician |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=673–784|year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17885697 |doi= |url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200709/200709beach.pdf}}</ref>
