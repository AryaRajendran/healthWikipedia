'''Semen extender''' is a liquid diluent which is added to semen to preserve its fertilizing ability.  The extender allows the semen to be freighted to the female, rather than requiring the male and female to be near to each other.<ref name="Transported Semen">[http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/faqai.htm] Equine-Reproduction.com - FAQ-AI article</ref> Special freezing extender use also allows cryogenic preservation of sperm ("frozen semen"), which may be transported for use, or used on-site at a later date.<ref name="Frozen Semen">[http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/faqfro.htm] Equine-Reproduction.com - Frozen Semen FAQ article</ref>

==Function==
The addition of extender to semen protects the sperm against possible damage by toxic seminal plasma, as well as providing nutrients and cooling buffers if the semen is to be cooled. In the case of freezing extenders, one or more penetrating cryoprotectants will be added. Typical cryoprotectants include [[glycerol]], [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] and [[dimethylformamide]]. Egg yolk, which has cryoprotective properties, is also a common component.<ref name="Egg Yolk">Vera-Munoz O., Amirat-Briand L., Diaz T., VÃ¡squez L., Schmidt E., Desherces S., Anton M., Bencharif D., Tainturier D.; (2009) Effect of semen dilution to low-sperm number per dose on motility and functionality of cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa using low-density lipoproteins (LDL) extender: Comparison to Triladyl and Bioxcell; Theriogenology 71:6; 895-900</ref>

==Ingredients==
In the equine, Kenney extender (named after its developer, Dr. [[Robert M. Kenney]] of the [[New Bolton Center|University of Pennsylvania, New Bolton]])<ref name="Kenney">[http://www.ca.uky.edu/gluck/AboutHOFKenney.asp  The Equine Research Hall of Fame - Robert M. Kenney]</ref> has been used for many years, and contains a [[non-fat dried milk solid]] (NFDMS) and [[glucose]]. Dual-sugar extenders typically have similar ingredients, with an additional sugar, [[sucrose]]. Other extenders (e.g. INRA '96) may also contain milk components.

[[Antibiotics]] are almost universal in semen extenders, especially those being used for shipping or freezing semen. [[Ticarcillin]] (often used in combination with [[clavulanic acid]] under the designation [[timentin]]), [[amikacin sulfate]], [[penicillin]], and [[gentamicin]] are commonly used. The latter - gentamicin - has been noted to reduce sperm motility in the [[equine]].<ref name="Gentamycin">Aurich C., Spergser J., (2007) Influence of [[bacteria]] and gentamicin on cooled-stored stallion spermatozoa; Theriogenology 67:5; 912-918</ref>
