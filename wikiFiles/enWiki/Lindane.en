==History and use==
The chemical was originally synthesised in 1825 by [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], but its pesticidal action was discovered only in 1942, after which lindane production, by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] Ltd (ICI), and use started up in the United Kingdom. It has been used to treat food crops and to forestry products, as a [[seed treatment]], a soil treatment, and to treat livestock and pets. It has also been used as pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies, formulated as a [[shampoo]] or lotion.<ref name="Commission">Commission for Environmental Cooperation.

It has been manufactured by several countries, including the [[United States]], [[China]], [[Brazil]], and several [[Europe|European countries]], but as of 2007 only [[India]] and possibly [[Russia]] are still producing it.<ref name="Commission"/> 

By November 2006, the use of lindane had been banned in 52 countries and restricted in 33 others. Seventeen countries, including the US and Canada, allowed either limited agricultural or pharmaceutical use.<ref name="Commission" /> In 2009, an international ban on the use of lindane in agriculture was implemented under the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]. A specific exemption allows for it to continue to be used in second-line treatments for the head lice and scabies for five more years.

===United States===
In the US, lindane pesticide products were regulated by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), while lindane medications are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). It was registered as an agricultural insecticide in the 1940s, and as pharmaceutical in 1951.<ref name="Commission"/> The EPA gradually began restricting its agricultural use in the 1970s due to concerns over its effects on human health and the environment.<ref name="EPAREDADD">U.S. EPA.

====Morton Grove lawsuit====
In 2006, Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals, the sole US manufacturer of lindane pharmaceuticals, sued the National Pediculosis Association, the Michigan Ecology Center, and two physicians, alleging that they disseminated defamatory materials regarding lindane and other charges. Morton Grove alleged more than $9.3 million in damages.<ref name="Lawsuit">Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ''v.'' The National Pediculosis Association,'' et al.'', No. 06 C 3815 (N.D. Ill.

==Human health effects==
The EPA and WHO both classify lindane as "moderately" acutely toxic. It has an oral {{LD50}} of 88&nbsp;mg/kg in rats and a dermal LD<sub>50</sub> of 1000&nbsp;mg/kg. Most of the adverse human health effects reported for lindane have been related to agricultural uses and chronic, occupational exposure of seed-treatment workers.<ref name="r16">Persistent Organic Pollutant Review Committee (POPRC).

===Cancer risk===
Based primarily on evidence from animal studies, most evaluations of lindane have concluded that it may possibly cause cancer. In 1987, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) classified lindane as a group 2B "possible" human carcinogen,<ref name="IARC" /> and in 2001 the EPA concluded there was "suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential."<ref name="EPACA" /> The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] determined that all isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, including lindane, "may reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans,"<ref name="Agency"/> and in 1999, the EPA characterized the evidence carcinogenicity for lindane as "suggestive ... of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential."<ref name="EPARED"/> Lindane and its isomers have also been on California's [[Proposition 65]] list of known carcinogens since 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/prop65_list/files/P65single061110.pdf|title=CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE TO CAUSE CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY|last=STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT|date=JUNE 11, 2010|accessdate=23 September 2010}}</ref> In contrast, the [[World Health Organization]] concluded in 2004 that "lindane is not likely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans."<ref name="r19">World Health Organization (WHO). Lindane in Drinking Water: Background Document for Development of WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality. 2004. http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/lindane/en/print.html</ref>

===Adverse reactions to lindane pharmaceuticals===
A variety of adverse reactions to lindane pharmaceuticals have been reported, ranging from skin irritation to [[seizure]]s, and, in rare instances, death. The most common side effects are burning sensations, itching, dryness and rash.<ref name="QandA"/> While serious effects are rare and have most often resulted from misuse, adverse reactions have occurred when used properly.<ref name="AssessmentMemo"/><ref name="LotionPrescribe"/><ref name="ShampooPrescribe"/><ref name="Postmarketing">U.S. FDA. Lindane Post Marketing Safety Review. Posted 2003. http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/lindaneaeredacted.pdf</ref> The FDA therefore requires a so-called [[black box warning]] on lindane products, which explains the risks of lindane products and its proper use.<ref name="QandA">U.S. FDA Centers for Drug Evaluation and Research. Lindane lotion and lindane shampoo questions and answers. Updated April 15, 2003. http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/lindaneQA.htm</ref><ref>http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/default.htm</ref>

The black box warning emphasizes that lindane should not be used on premature infants and individuals with known uncontrolled seizure disorders, and should be used with caution in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions (e.g., [[dermatitis]], [[psoriasis]]) and people who weigh less than 110&nbsp;lbs (50&nbsp;kg) as they may be at risk of serious neurotoxicity.<ref name="LotionPrescribe">Lindane lotion, USP, 1% prescribing information.

Updated March 28, 2003. http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2003/006309shampoolbl.pdf.</ref>

==Environmental contamination==
Lindane is a [[persistent organic pollutant]]: it is relatively long-lived in the environment, it is transported long distances by natural processes like [[global distillation]], and it can [[bioaccumulate]] in [[food chain]]s, though it is rapidly eliminated when exposure is discontinued.<ref name="r16"/>  

The production and agricultural use of lindane are the primary causes of environmental contamination,<ref name="r23">U.S. EPA. Assessment of lindane and other hexachlorocyclohexane isomers. February 8, 2006</ref> and levels of lindane in the environment have been decreasing in the U.S., consistent with decreasing agricultural usage patterns.<ref name="r24">United Nations Environment Programme.  POPRC of the Stockholm Convention. Draft risk profile: Lindane. July 2006.</ref> The production of lindane generates large amounts of waste hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, and it is estimated that "every ton of lindane manufactured produces about 9 tons of toxic waste."<ref name="LifeAfter">[http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2008/116-3/ss.html#life Life after Lindane in California: Water Concentrations, Poison Control Calls Drop Following Ban], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'',  Volume 116, Number 3, March 2008.</ref>  Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic molecules, a process known as "cracking." <ref name="r24" /><ref name="IHPALegacy">International HCH & Pesticides Association. The legacy of lindane HCH isomer production. 2006. http://www.ihpa.info/docs/library/Lindane%20Main%20Report%20DEF20JAN06.pdf</ref>

When lindane is used in agriculture, an estimated 12-30% of it volatilizes into the atmosphere, where it is subject to [[global distillation|long-range transport]] and can be deposited by rainfall. Lindane in soil can leach to surface and even ground water, and can bioaccumulate in the food chain.<ref name="EPAREDADD"/>  However, biotransformation and elimination are relatively rapid when exposure is discontinued.<ref name="Commission" /> Most exposure of the general population to lindane has resulted from agricultural uses and the intake of foods, such as produce, meats and milk, produced from treated agricultural commodities. Human exposure has decreased significantly since the cancellation of agricultural uses in 2006. Even so, the CDC published in 2005 its Third National Report on Human Exposures to Environmental Chemicals, which found no detectable amounts of lindane in human blood taken from a random sampling of about 5,000 people in the US as part of the NHANES study (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm ).<ref name="CDCReport3">US CDC. Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals. 2005. Available at: [http://www.cdc.gov/ExposureReport/pdf/thirdreport.pdf  http://www.cdc.gov/ExposureReport/pdf/thirdreport.pdf].</ref> The lack of detection of lindane in this large human "biomonitoring" study likely reflects the increasingly limited agricultural uses of lindane over the last two decades.  The cancellation of agricultural uses in the United States will further reduce the amount of lindane introduced into the environment by more than 99%.<ref name="Commission" /><ref name="EPAREDADD" />

Over time, lindane is broken down in soil, sediment and water into less harmful substances by algae, fungi and bacteria; however, the process is relatively slow and dependent on ambient environmental conditions.<ref name="Agency"/> The ecological impact of lindane's environmental persistence continues to be debated.

The US EPA determined in 2002 that the Agency does not believe that lindane contaminates drinking water in excess of levels considered safe.<ref name="Agency"/> [[U.S. Geologic Survey]] teams concluded the same in 1999 and 2000.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kolpin DW, Furlong ET, Meyer MT ''et al.'' | year = 2002 | title = Pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic wastewater contaminants in U.S. streams, 1999–2000: A national reconnaissance | url = | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 1202–1211 }}</ref> With regard to lindane medications, the EPA conducted "down-the-drain" estimates of the amount of lindane reaching public water supplies  and concluded that lindane levels from pharmaceutical sources were "extremely low" and not of concern.<ref name="EPARED"/>

Note that the EPA has set the maximum contaminant level or "MCL" for lindane allowed in public water supplies and considered safe for drinking at 200 parts per trillion (ppt).<ref name="EPAReview03">U.S. EPA. Announcement of completion of EPA's review of existing drinking water standards. Federal Register. 68(138): July 18, 2003.</ref> By comparison, the state of California imposes a lower MCL for lindane of 19 ppt.<ref name="CAOutcomes" /> However, the California standard is based on a dated 1988 national water criterion that was subsequently revised by the EPA in 2003 to 980 ppt.<ref name="EPACA" /><ref name="EPAReview03" /><ref name="CAGoal">California Public Health Goal for Lindane in Drinking Water. Available at: [http://oehha.ca.gov/water/phg/pdf/lindan_f.pdf http://oehha.ca.gov/water/phg/pdf/lindan_f.pdf].</ref><ref name="AltLindane">IPEN. Lindane: Agricultural and pharmaceutical alternatives to lindane. Available at: [http://www.akaction.org/REPORTS/Alternatives%20to%20Lindane%20Report%204-29-09.pdf http://www.akaction.org/REPORTS/Alternatives%20to%20Lindane%20Report%204-29-09.pdf]</ref> The EPA stated that the change resulted from "significant scientific advances made in the last two decades particularly in the areas of cancer and noncancer risk assessments." <ref name="EPAReview03" /> While the EPA considered raising the MCL standard for lindane to 980 ppt at that time, the change was never implemented because states had little difficultly in maintaining lindane levels below the 200 ppt MCL limit already in place.<ref name="EPAReview03" /> Today, the legally enforceable MCL standard for lindane is 200 ppt while the national water criterion for lindane is 980 ppt.<ref name="EPAReview03" />

===Isomers===
Lindane is the gamma isomer of [[hexachlorocyclohexane]] ("γ-HCH"). In addition to the issue of lindane pollution, there are concerns related to the other isomers of HCH, namely [[alpha-HCH]] and [[beta-HCH]], which are notably more toxic than lindane, lack its insecticidal properties, and are byproducts of lindane production.<ref name="Agency" />  In the 1940s and 1950s, lindane producers stockpiled these isomers in open heaps, which led to ground and water contamination. The International HCH and Pesticide Forum has since been established to bring together experts to address the clean-up and containment of these sites.<ref name="IHPALegacy" />{{Dead link|date=July 2009}} Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic industrial chemicals, a process known as "[[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]."<ref name="Agency" /><ref name="IHPALegacy" /> Today, only a few production plants remain active worldwide to accommodate public-health uses of lindane and declining agricultural needs.<ref name="Commission" /> Lindane has not been manufactured in the U.S. since the mid-1970s, but continues to be imported.
