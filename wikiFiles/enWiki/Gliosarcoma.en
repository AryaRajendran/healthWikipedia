'''Gliosarcoma''' is a rare type of [[glioma]], a [[cancer]] of the brain that comes from [[glial]], or supportive, brain cells, as opposed to the [[neural]] brain cells. Gliosarcoma is a malignant cancer, and is defined as a glioblastoma consisting of gliomatous and [[sarcoma|sarcomatous]] components.<ref name=pmid20415184>{{cite journal |author=Ayadi L, Charfi S, Khabir A, ''et al.'' |title=[Cerebral gliosarcoma: clinico-pathologic study of 8 cases] |language=French |journal=Tunis Med |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=142–6 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20415184 |doi= |url=}}</ref> 

It is estimated that approximately 2.1% of all [[glioblastoma|glioblastomas]] are gliosarcomas. Although most gliomas rarely show metastases outside the [[cerebrum]], gliosarcomas have a propensity to do so, most commonly spreading through the blood to the [[lungs]], and also [[liver]] and [[lymph nodes]].<ref name="pmid17171442">{{cite journal |author=Beumont et al. |title=Gliosarcoma with multiple extracranial metastases: case report and review of the literature |journal=J. Neurooncology |volume=83 |pages=39–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17171442 |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9295-x |last2=Kupsky |first2=WJ |last3=Barger |first3=GR |last4=Sloan |first4=AE |issue=1}}</ref>

Gliosarcomas have an epidemiology similar to that of glioblastomas, with the average age of onset being 54 years, and males being affected twice as often as females. They are most commonly present in the [[temporal lobe]]. It has been suggested that gliosarcomas are [[radiation]]-induced.
