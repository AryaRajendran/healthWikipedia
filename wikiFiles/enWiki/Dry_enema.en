A '''dry enema''' is an alternative technique for cleansing the human [[rectum]] either for reasons of health, or for sexual hygiene.  It is accomplished by squirting a small amount of sterile [[lubricant]] into the rectum, resulting in a [[bowel movement]] more quickly and with less violence than can be achieved by an oral [[laxative]].

It is called "dry" by contrast to the more usual [[enema|wet enema]], because no water is used.

===Suppositories=== 
A rudimentary form of "dry" enema is the use of a non-medicated [[glycerin]] suppository.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glycerin Suppository|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/GuidetoCancerDrugs/glycerin-suppository|work=American Cancer Society|publisher=American Cancer Society, Inc|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>   However, due to the relative hardiness of the [[suppository]] - necessary for its insertion into the human body - before the glycerin can act, it must be melted by the heat of the body, and hence it does not take effect for up to an hour. Often the [[hygroscopic]] glycerin irritates the sensitive [[Mucous membrane|membranes]] of the rectum resulting in forceful expulsion of the suppository without any [[laxative]] effects.

===Lubrication injection===
A quicker form of the dry enema utilizes the [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] of a small amount of water-based [[lubricant]] such as [[KY Jelly]] into the rectum via a non-hypodermic [[syringe]], such as an oral syringe, or from some other source.  Then again since the glycerin itself is an effective producer of the desired [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of the colonic muscles it is simpler - and more easily controlled - to introduce 5 - 10 cc of glycerin into directly into the rectum.  Specialist syringes are available for this purpose but are hard to find.  An alternative is to use an enema [[nozzle]] which has an intake end which is compatible with a standard [[Syringe|hypodermic syringe]].  This allows the immediate [[Intraperitoneal injection|injection]] of the 5-10 ccs. required, and results can  be expected in 2-4 minutes.  Another alternative is to use a normal 5 or 10cc syringe inserted directly into the anus.  This needs to be done carefully to avoid scratching the anal passage.  The passage should be lubricated with sorbolene cream or any water-based lubricant.  Only a syringe with a Luer-slip should be used, not a [[Luer taper|Luer-lock tip]] (a syringe end molded to take a screw-on needle).  Penetration is better performed by the patient to eliminate any pain.  The patient should be encouraged to wait at least 15 minutes in order that [[peristalsis]] can reach the full length of the rectum, but many will find this impossible and this treatment should therefore be applied only when the facilities to evacuate are nearby.


The usual amount of lubricant applied is about 2 tsp (10 cc), which will produce a [[Defecation|movement]] in 30 minutes or less. The movement will be produced in a compact body, rather than in the more copious liquid form produced by a wet enema; and since no water is used, none will be retained higher up in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], to be expelled at a later, and possibly inconvenient, time.

A further advantage of this technique for [[sexual hygiene]] is that any slight remaining traces of [[Feces|fecal material]] will - due to the presence of the lubricant - tend to adhere to the wall of the [[rectum]] rather than to any foreign object which may subsequently be inserted.
