In the book, Whitaker tries to answer that question and examines the long-term outcomes for the mentally ill in the U.S. In April 2011, [[Investigative Reporters and Editors]] (IRE) announced that the book had won its award as the best investigative journalism book of 2010 stating, "this book provides an in-depth exploration of medical studies and science and intersperses compelling anecdotal examples. In the end, Whitaker punches holes in the conventional wisdom of treatment of mental illness with drugs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ire.org/awards/ire-awards/winners/2010-ire-awards-winners/#book|title=IRE Awards 2010 |publisher=Investigative Reporters and Editors|accessdate=2011-05-11}}</ref>

==Synopsis==

===Magic bullets===
[[File:SSDI-SSI-1987-2003.png|thumb|right|alt=Chart showing increase (in red) over baseline (in blue) between 1987 and 2003|Number of Americans who received [[Social Security Disability Insurance|SSDI]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|SSI]] for mental disability in 1987 (blue) when [[Eli Lilly and Company]] introduced the antidepressive drug [[Prozac]], compared to 2003 (red).]]
Whitaker begins by showing that the [[typical antipsychotics|antipsychotics]], [[benzodiazepines]] and [[antidepressants]] were discovered as side effects during research for antihistamines (specifically [[promethazine]]), gram negative antibiotics (specifically [[mephenesin]]) and the anti-tuberculosis agents [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]] respectively. The psychiatric mechanisms of action of these drugs were not known at the time and these were initially called major tranquilizers (now typical antipsychotics) due to their induction of "euphoric quietiude"; minor tranquilizers (now benzodiazepines) and psychic energizers (now antidepressants) due to patients "dancing in the wards."<ref>{{Cite book

This also followed the industry's development of "magic bullets" that treat people with, for example, [[diabetes]], which provided an analogy to sell the idea of these drugs to the public. It was not until many years later, after the mechanisms of these drugs were determined, that the serotonergic hypothesis of depression and dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia were developed to fall in line with the drug's mechanisms. According to Whitaker's analysis of the primary literature, lower levels of serotonin and higher levels of dopmine "have proved to be true in patients WITH prior exposure to antidepressants or antipsychotics (ie as homeostatic mechanisms) but NOT in patients without prior exposure."<ref>{{Cite journal| author = M.

Another means by which he undermines the magic bullet theory is that he shows that the historical notion that the "invention of the antipsychotic [[Chlorpromazine|Thorazine]]" having emptied the asylums is a myth.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Anatomy of an Epidemic: Psychiatric Drugs and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America|url=http://www.cchr.org/sites/default/files/Anatomy_of_an_Epidemic_Psychiatric_Drugs_Rise_of_Mental_Illness.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry|publisher=Springer|page=1|issue=I|volume=7|date=Spring 2005|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> His case begins by showing that during the late 1940s and 1950s ~75% of cases admitted for first episode schizophrenia recovered to the community by approximately 3 years (Thorazine was not released until 1955).<ref>{{Cite book

In fact, based on the only large scale first episode schizophrenia study of this era, 88% of those who were not treated were discharged within eighteen months compared to 74% of [[neuroleptic]] treated.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = L.

These programs provided federal subsidies for nursing home care but no such subsidy for care in state mental hospitals, and so the states, seeking to save money, began shipping their chronic patients to nursing homes.

===Psychiatric drugs===
Whitaker favors psychiatric medications but believes that they must be used in a "selective, cautious manner. It should be understood that they’re not fixing any chemical imbalances. And honestly, they should be used on a short-term basis."<ref name=Lipinski>{{cite news|author=Lipinski, Jed|title="Anatomy of an Epidemic": The hidden damage of psychiatric drugs|date=April 27, 2010|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/04/27/interview_whitaker_anatomy_of_an_epidemic|work=Salon|publisher=Salon Media|accessdate=October 9, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101002200623/http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/04/27/interview_whitaker_anatomy_of_an_epidemic| archivedate= 2 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 

Whitaker traces the effects of what looks like an [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] epidemic:<ref>Whitaker, p. 208</ref> the drugs that patients receive can perturb their normal brain function.<ref name="Whitaker, p. 210">Whitaker, p. 210</ref> 

Whitaker suggests that the "wonder drug" glow around the second generation psychotropics has long since disappeared. He views the "hyping" of the top-selling [[atypical antipsychotic]]s as "one of the more embarrassing episodes in psychiatry's history, as one government study after another failed to find that they were any better than the first-generation anti-psychotics."<ref>{{cite web |title=Anatomy of an Epidemic |author=Robert Whitaker |year=2010 |publisher=Crown |page=303 }}</ref>

One of Whitaker's solutions is the style of care documented by professor Jaakko Seikkula at Keropudas Hospital in [[Tornio]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] where drugs are given to patients only on a limited basis, with good outcomes. According to Whitaker, the district has the lowest per capita spending on mental health of all health districts in [[Finland]].<ref>Whitaker, p. 343</ref> He also advocates that those with depression engage in exercise. Exercise for depression is so successful that in the UK the doctor may write a prescription for exercise. In fact, studies have shown that exercise produces a "substantial improvement" within six weeks, that its effect size is "large," and that 70% of all depressed patients respond to an exercise program. "These success rates are quite remarkable," German investigators wrote in 2008.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = F.

===Children===
Whitaker sees that children are vulnerable to being prescribed a ''lifetime'' of drugs. As the author says, a psychiatrist and parents may give a child a "cocktail" to force him or her to behave. Then when this child grows up to eighteen, Whitaker says he or she becomes a disabled adult.<ref>Whitaker, chapters 11 and 12</ref>

==Review of data and statistics==
Whitaker spent a year and a half researching for this book,<ref name="Whitaker, p. 210"/> and maintains a website listing some relevant studies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Mad in America|url=http://www.madinamerica.com/|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref>

As of October 2010, the only negative review of the book, written by sleep researcher Dennis Rosen for ''The Boston Globe'', asks for a review of data, and devotes a paragraph to [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[AIDS denialism]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rosen, Dennis|title=Tying the rise in mental illness to drugs used in its treatment|date=April 14, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/04/14/tying_the_rise_in_mental_illness_to_drugs_used_in_its_treatment/|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> Other reviews were in ''[[New Scientist]]'',<ref name=Burch /> ''[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]'',<ref name=Good /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,<ref name=Fitzpatrick /> and ''[[Salon.com|Salon]].<ref name=Lipinski />

Over a year after the book was published, [[Marcia Angell]], former editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', published a two-part review of Whitaker's and other books in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''<ref>{{cite news|author=Angell, Marcia|title=The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why?|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/|date=June 23, 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/}} and {{cite news|author=Angell, Marcia|title=The Illusions of Psychiatry|date=July 14, 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jul/14/illusions-of-psychiatry/|work=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref> which received a great deal of publicity. Dr. Angell was seeking and not finding any evidence after 50 years of use that psychiatric drugs have given patients any benefit. Among those who read Dr. Angell's review was John Horgan who then wrote a positive review for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. Horgan says the book has been ignored by the major media.<ref>{{cite news|author=Horgan, John|title=Are Psychiatric Medications Making Us Sicker?|date=September 18, 2011|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Are-Psychiatric-Medications/128976/|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref>

Whitaker, who had been an invited keynote speaker, was "uninvited" from the Alternatives 2010 conference. The event has been funded since 1985 by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. [[MindFreedom International]] started an online campaign and many people wrote to [[Barack Obama|President Obama]].
