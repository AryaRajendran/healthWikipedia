There have been traditions of people [[ice swimming]] in the middle of winter on a lake for short stretches, sometimes as part of a Polar Bear Club. Sometimes people taking short swims for thirty seconds or so have felt invigorated afterwards.<ref name=twsM46/> The [[Coney Island Polar Bear Club]] was founded in 1903. A Polar Bear member explained:

In the 1890s, Russian immigrant Professor Louis Sugarman of [[Little Falls, NY]] brought his practice of ice bathing to the United States.

}}</ref> but other reports counsel against such a practice. There are reports that some athletes use this technique, sometimes known as contrast water therapy or [[contrast bath therapy]], in which cold water and warmer water are alternated.<ref name=twsAugN31/> One method of doing this was to have two tubs&ndash;&ndash;one cold (10‚Äì15 degrees Celsius) and another hot (37‚Äì40 degrees Celsius)&ndash;&ndash;and to do one minute in the cold tub followed by two minutes in a hot tub, and to repeat this procedure three times.<ref name=twsAugN31/>

Accounts vary about how long to be immersed and how often to do them.

===Ice baths versus cold baths===
Several sources suggest that cold baths (60‚Äì75 degrees Fahrenheit) were preferable to ice baths. Physiotherapist Tony Wilson of the [[University of Southampton]] said that extremely cold temperatures were unnecessary and a "cold bath" would be just as effective as an ice bath.<ref name=twsM46/> Another agreed that a mere cold bath is preferable to ice baths which are "unnecessary."<ref name=twsAugN31/> A third report suggested that cool water (60‚Äì75 degrees Fahrenheit) was just as good as cold water (54‚Äì60 degrees Fahrenheit) and that eight to ten minutes should be sufficient time, and warned against exceeding ten minutes.<ref name=twsAugN32/>

 |newspaper= The New York Times
 |quote= According to research, ice baths can be helpful ‚Äî at least in comparison to doing nothing. In a new report in The Cochrane Library, researchers at the University of Ulster in Ireland pooled data from 17 studies involving 366 people, many of whom sat in ice baths for several minutes after cycling, running or lifting weights. Compared with passive rest after exercise, a short bout of cold therapy reduced soreness by 20 percent, the researchers found.

The review was limited by selection bias, heterogeneity, inability to subject double-blind restrictions on the participants or personnel, and subjectivity of the pain scale by which soreness was judged. Immediately following treatment, there was no significant difference in soreness between cold water immersion and no interventions (Standarized mean difference -0.07 with confidence interval [-0.43, 0.28]).  Cold water immersion was found to significantly reduce muscle soreness at 24 hours (-0.55 [-0.84, -0.27]), 48 hours (-0.66 [-0.97, -0.35]), 72 hours (-0.93 [-1.36, -0.51]), and 96 hours (-0.58 [-1.0, -0.16]). However, the mean soreness difference was less than 1 on a scale of 1 to 10 between cold water immersion and no treatment at each interval.</ref> existing studies of 366 subjects which compared cold-water immersion following exercise with doing nothing or resting as a way to prevent subsequent muscle soreness. Study variables included the level of soreness, cold water immersion versus no treatment, intensity and duration of exercise, time between exercise and measurement of soreness, and other variables. The authors found evidence that cold water immersion had a slight effect on reducing soreness, not immediately after exercise but at intervals of up to 96 hours after exercise, and that it lowered levels of fatigue and sped up physical recovery, although they noted that these studies did not examine other variables such as possible negative effects on the body. The authors concluded that high quality research was required.<ref name="Cochrane"/>
