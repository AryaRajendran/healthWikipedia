'''Penicillin''' (sometimes abbreviated '''PCN''' or '''pen''') is a group of [[antibiotic]]s derived from ''[[Penicillium]]'' fungi.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000079881|penicillin}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> They include [[benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]], [[procaine benzylpenicillin|procaine penicillin]], [[benzathine benzylpenicillin|benzathine penicillin]], and [[phenoxymethylpenicillin|penicillin V]].
Penicillin antibiotics are historically significant because they are the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases, such as [[syphilis]], and infections caused by [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]]  and [[streptococcus|streptococci]]. Penicillins are still widely used today, though many types of [[bacteria]] are now [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]]. All penicillins are [[beta-lactam antibiotic|β-lactam antibiotics]] and are used in the treatment of [[bacteria]]l [[infection]]s caused by susceptible, usually [[Gram-positive]], organisms.

==Medical uses==
The term "penicillin" is often used generically to refer to [[benzylpenicillin]] (penicillin G), [[procaine benzylpenicillin]] (procaine penicillin), [[benzathine benzylpenicillin]] (benzathine penicillin), and [[phenoxymethylpenicillin]] (penicillin V).

Procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin have the same antibacterial activity as benzylpenicillin but act for a longer time span. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is less active against Gram-negative bacteria than benzylpenicillin.<ref>

==Adverse effects==
{{main|Penicillin drug reaction}}
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥ 1% of patients) associated with use of the penicillins include [[diarrhoea]], [[hypersensitivity]], [[nausea]], rash, [[neurotoxicity]], [[urticaria]], and [[superinfection]] (including [[candidiasis]]). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include fever, vomiting, [[erythema]], [[dermatitis]], [[angioedema]], [[seizures]] (especially in epileptics), and [[pseudomembranous colitis]].<ref name="AMH2006" />

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main|Beta-lactam antibiotic}}
[[File:Penicillin spheroplast generation horizontal.svg|upright|Bacteria that attempt to divide in the presence of penicillin fail to do so, and instead end up shedding their cell walls.|thumb|right|600px]]
[[File:Penicillin inhibition.svg|thumb|upright|right|Penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics act by inhibiting [[penicillin-binding proteins]], which normally catalyze cross-linking of bacterial cell walls.]]

Bacteria constantly remodel their [[peptidoglycan]] cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide. [[beta-lactam antibiotic|''β''-Lactam antibiotics]] inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan [[cross-link]]s in the bacterial [[cell wall]]; this is achieved through binding of the four-membered ''β''-lactam [[cycloalkane|ring]] of penicillin to the [[enzyme]] [[DD-transpeptidase]]. Consequently, DD-transpeptidase cannot catalyze formation of these cross-links, and an imbalance between cell wall production and degradation develops, causing the cell to rapidly die.

More specifically, the enzymes that [[hydrolyze]] the peptidoglycan cross-links continue to function, even while those that form such cross-links do not. This weakens the cell wall of the bacterium, and osmotic pressure continues to rise—eventually causing cell death ([[cytolysis]]). In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall's peptidoglycans. The small size of the penicillins increases their potency, by allowing them to penetrate the entire depth of the cell wall. This is in contrast to the [[glycopeptide antibiotics]] [[vancomycin]] and [[teicoplanin]], which are both much larger than the penicillins.

[[Gram-positive]] bacteria are called [[protoplast]]s when they lose their cell walls. [[Gram-negative]] bacteria do not lose their cell walls completely and are called [[spheroplast]]s after treatment with penicillin.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Penicillin shows a synergistic effect with [[aminoglycosides]], since the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows aminoglycosides to penetrate the bacterial cell wall more easily, allowing their disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell. This results in a lowered [[Minimum Bactericidal Concentration|MBC]] for susceptible organisms.

Penicillins, like other ''β''-lactam antibiotics, block not only the division of bacteria, including [[cyanobacteria]], but also the division of cyanelles, the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[organelle]]s of the [[glaucophyte]]s, and the division of [[chloroplast]]s of [[bryophyte]]s. In contrast, they have no effect on the [[plastid]]s of the highly developed [[vascular plant]]s. This supports the [[endosymbiotic theory]] of the [[evolution]] of plastid division in land [[plant]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Britta|last1=Kasten|first2=Ralf|last2=Reski|link2=[[Ralf Reski]]|date=30 March 1997|title=β-lactam antibiotics inhibit chloroplast division in a moss (Physcomitrella patens) but not in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)|journal=Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=150|pages=137–140|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2640663|issue=1–2|doi=10.1016/S0176-1617(97)80193-9}}</ref>

==Structure==
[[File:Penicillin-G 3D.png|250px|thumb|right|Chemical structure of Penicillin G. The sulfur and nitrogen of the five-membered [[thiazolidine]] ring are shown in yellow and blue respectively. The image shows that the thiazolidine ring and fused four-membered ''β''-lactam are not in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].]]

The term "[[penam]]" is used to describe the common core skeleton of a member of the penicillins. This core has the molecular formula R-C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>S, where R is the variable side chain that differentiates the penicillins from one another. The penam core has a [[molecular weight]] of 243&nbsp;g/mol, with larger penicillins having molecular weights near 450—for example, [[cloxacillin]] has a molecular weight of 436&nbsp;g/mol. The key structural feature of the penicillins is the four-membered ''β''-lactam ring; this structural [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] is essential for penicillin's antibacterial activity. The ''β''-lactam ring is itself fused to a five-membered [[thiazolidine]] ring. The fusion of these two rings causes the ''β''-lactam ring to be more reactive than monocyclic ''β''-lactams because the two fused rings distort the ''β''-lactam [[amide bond]] and therefore remove the [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance stabilisation]] normally found in these chemical bonds.<ref>Nicolaou (1996), pg. 43.</ref>

==Biosynthesis==
[[Image:Penicillin-biosynthesis.png|thumb|Penicillin biosynthesis]]
Overall, there are three main and important steps to the biosynthesis of [[penicillin G]] (benzylpenicillin).
* The first step is the condensation of three amino acids—<small>L</small>-α-aminoadipic acid, <small>L</small>-cysteine, <small>L</small>-valine into a [[tripeptide]].<ref name ="Regulation">

* The second step in the biosynthesis of penicillin G is the [[Redox|oxidative]] conversion of linear ACV into the [[Bicyclic molecule|bicyclic]] intermediate isopenicillin N by [[isopenicillin N synthase]] (IPNS), which is encoded by the gene ''pcbC''.<ref name ="Regulation" /><ref name=Molecular/> Isopenicillin N is a very weak intermediate, because it does not show strong antibiotic activity.<ref name=Fern/>
* The final step is a [[transamidation]] by [[isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase]], in which the α-aminoadipyl side-chain of isopenicillin N is removed and exchanged for a [[Phenylacetic acid|phenylacetyl]] side-chain. This reaction is encoded by the gene ''penDE'', which is unique in the process of obtaining penicillins.<ref name ="Regulation" />

==Production==
Penicillin is a [[Secondary metabolism|secondary metabolite]] of certain species of ''[[Penicillium]]'' and is produced when growth of the fungus is inhibited by stress. It is not produced during active growth. Production is also limited by feedback in the synthesis pathway of penicillin.

::[[alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|α-ketoglutarate]] + [[Acetyl-CoA|AcCoA]] → [[Homocitric acid|homocitrate]] → [[alpha-Aminoadipic acid|<small>L</small>-α-aminoadipic acid]] → [[Lysine|<small>L</small>-lysine]] + [[Beta-lactam|β-lactam]]

The by-product, {{Smallcaps|l}}-lysine, inhibits the production of homocitrate, so the presence of exogenous lysine should be avoided in penicillin production.

The ''Penicillium'' cells are grown using a technique called [[fed-batch]] culture, in which the cells are constantly subject to stress, which is required for induction of penicillin production. The available carbon sources are also important: [[Glucose]] inhibits penicillin production, whereas [[lactose]] does not. The [[pH]] and the levels of nitrogen, lysine, phosphate, and oxygen of the batches must also be carefully controlled.

The [[Biotechnology|biotechnological]] method of [[directed evolution]] has been applied to produce by mutation a large number of ''Penicillium'' strains. These techniques include [[Polymerase chain reaction|error-prone PCR]], [[DNA shuffling]], {{abbr|ITCHY|incremental truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymes}}, and strand-overlap PCR.

Semisynthetic penicillins are prepared starting from the penicillin nucleus [[6-APA]].

===Discovery===
{{Main|History of penicillin}}
[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|framed|right|Alexander Fleming, who is credited with discovering penicillin in 1928.]]
The discovery of penicillin is attributed to [[Scotland|Scottish]] scientist and Nobel laureate [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928.<ref>{{cite web

The active ingredient in that mold, which Fleming named penicillin, turned out to be an infection-fighting agent of enormous potency. When it was finally recognized for what it is—the most efficacious life-saving drug in the world—penicillin would alter forever the treatment of bacterial infections.}}</ref> He showed that, if ''[[Penicillium rubens]]''<ref name=Houbraken2011>{{cite journal | author = Houbraken J, Frisvad JC, Samson RA | year = 2011 | title = Fleming's penicillin producing strain is not ''Penicillium chrysogenum'' but ''P. rubens'' | url = | journal = IMA Fungus | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 87–95 | doi = 10.5598/imafungus.2011.02.01.12 | pmid = 22679592 | pmc = 3317369 }}</ref> were grown in the appropriate substrate, it would exude a substance with antibiotic properties, which he dubbed penicillin. This [[serendipity|serendipitous]] observation began the modern era of antibiotic discovery. The development of penicillin for use as a medicine is attributed to the Australian Nobel laureate [[Howard Walter Florey]], together with the German Nobel laureate [[Ernst Chain]] and the English biochemist [[Norman Heatley]].

The first published reference appears in the publication of the [[Royal Society]] in 1875, by [[John Tyndall]].<ref>Phil. Trans., 1876, 166, pp. 27–74. Referred to at: [[Discoveries of anti-bacterial effects of penicillium moulds before Fleming]]</ref> Joaquim Monteiro Caminhoá, Professor of Botany and Zoology of the Faculty of Medicine of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, also recognised the antibiotic activity of ''Penicillium'' and other fungi in 1877. In his book, ''Elements of General and Medical Botany'' (under a section titled "Useful fungi, harmful and curious"), he stated:
<blockquote>"The mould (''Penicillium infestans'', ''Penicillium glaucum'', figure 1680, Ascophora and many others) is useful because it feeds on decaying organic matter and destroys putrifaction so that, as a rule, the odour of infection does not occur, or is produced in infinitely smaller amounts."<ref>J. M. Caminhoá, "Cogumélos uteis, nocivos e curiosos."  In: ''Elementos de Botânica geral e médica'', 1877, p. 1718. Published in 5 vols, Typographia Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. (Reported by Prof P. R. Chocair as held at the Biblioteca da Câmara Municipal de São Paulo, Brasil)</ref></blockquote>

In 1895, [[Vincenzo Tiberio]], physician of the [[University of Naples]] published a research about a mold (''Penicillium'') in a water well that had an antibacterial action.<ref>http://www.almanacco.rm.cnr.it/reader/cw_usr_view_recensione?id_articolo=1704&giornale=1679</ref><ref>http://festival2011.festivalscienza.it/site/home/programma-2011/eventi-per-tipo/conferenze/vincenzo-tiberio-vero-scopritore-degli-antibiotici.html</ref>

[[Ernest Duchesne]] documented it in an 1897 paper, which was not accepted by the Institut Pasteur because of his youth. In March 2000, doctors at the [[San Juan De Dios Educational Foundation|San Juan de Dios Hospital]] in San José, Costa Rica, published the manuscripts of the Costa Rican scientist and medical doctor [[Clodomiro Picado Twight|Clodomiro (Clorito) Picado Twight]] (1887–1944). They reported Picado's observations on the inhibitory actions of fungi of the genus ''Penicillium'' between 1915 and 1927. Picado reported his discovery to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]], yet did not patent it, even though his investigations started years before Fleming's. Joseph Lister was experimenting with ''Penicillum'' in 1871 for his [[Aseptic technique|aseptic surgery]]. He found that it weakened the microbes, but then he dismissed the fungi.

These early investigations did not lead to the use of antibiotics to treat infection because they took place in obscure circumstances, and the idea that infections were caused by transmissible agents was not widely accepted at the time. Sterilization measures had been shown to limit the outbreak and spread of disease; however, the mechanism of transmission of disease by parasites, bacteria, viruses and other agents was unknown. In the late 19th century, knowledge was increasing of the mechanisms by which living organisms become infected, how they manage infection once it has begun and, most importantly in the case of penicillin, the effect that natural and man-made agents could have on the progress of infection.

Fleming recounted that the date of his discovery of penicillin was on the morning of Friday, September 28, 1928.<ref>{{cite book |author=Haven, Kendall&nbsp;F. |title=Marvels of Science : 50 Fascinating 5-Minute Reads |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=Littleton, CO |year=1994 |pages=182 |isbn=1-56308-159-8 }}</ref> It was a fortuitous accident: in his laboratory in the basement of St.&nbsp;Mary's Hospital in [[London]] (now part of [[Imperial College]]), Fleming noticed a Petri dish containing ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' plate culture he mistakenly left open, was contaminated by blue-green [[mould]], which formed a visible growth. There was a halo of inhibited bacterial growth around the mould. Fleming concluded the mould released a substance that repressed the growth and [[lysis|lysing]] the bacteria. He grew a pure culture and discovered it was a ''[[Penicillium]]'' mould, now known to be ''Penicillium notatum''. [[Charles Thom]], an American specialist working at the [[U.S.&nbsp;Department of Agriculture]], was the acknowledged expert, and Fleming referred the matter to him. Fleming coined the term "penicillin" to describe the [[filtrate]] of a broth [[microbiological culture|culture]] of the ''Penicillium'' mould. Even in these early stages, penicillin was found to be most effective against [[Gram-positive]] bacteria, and ineffective against [[Gram-negative]] organisms and fungi. He expressed initial optimism that penicillin would be a useful disinfectant, being highly potent with minimal toxicity compared to antiseptics of the day, and noted its laboratory value in the isolation of ''Bacillus influenzae'' (now ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'').<ref name="Flemming1929">{{cite journal | author=Fleming A. | title=On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of ''B. influenzæ'' | journal=British Journal of Experimental Pathology | year=1929 | volume=10 | issue=31 | pages=226–36}}</ref> After further experiments, Fleming was convinced penicillin could not last long enough in the human body to kill pathogenic bacteria, and stopped studying it after 1931. He restarted [[clinical trials]] in 1934, and continued to try to get someone to purify it until 1940.<ref name="Brown2004">{{cite book | author= Brown, Kevin. | title=Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution. | location=Stroud | publisher=Sutton | year=2004 | isbn = 0-7509-3152-3}}</ref>

[[File:Howard Walter Florey 1945.jpg|thumb|150px|Florey (pictured), Fleming and Chain shared a Nobel Prize in 1945 for their work on penicillin.]]
In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a [[pathologist]] at the [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary|Royal Infirmary]] in [[Sheffield]], attempted to use penicillin to treat [[sycosis barbae]], eruptions in beard follicles, but was unsuccessful, probably because the drug did not penetrate the skin deeply enough. Moving on to [[Neonatal conjunctivitis|ophthalmia neonatorum]], a gonococcal infection in infants, he achieved the first recorded cure with penicillin, on November 25, 1930. He then cured four additional patients (one adult and three infants) of eye infections, and failed to cure a fifth.<ref name="Wainwright, M & Swan, HT 1986 42–56">

In 1939, Australian scientist [[Howard Walter Florey|Howard Florey]] (later Baron Florey) and a team of researchers ([[Ernst Boris Chain]], [[Arthur Duncan Gardner]], [[Norman Heatley]], M. Jennings, J. Orr-Ewing and G. Sanders) at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, [[University of Oxford]] made significant progress in showing the ''[[in vivo]]'' bactericidal action of penicillin. Their attempts to treat humans failed because of insufficient volumes of penicillin (the first patient treated was [[Albert Alexander|Reserve Constable Albert Alexander]]), but they proved it harmless and effective on mice.<ref>

Notably, survivors of the November 28, 1942 [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] in [[Boston]], which killed 492 people, were treated with penicillin. [[Merck & Co.|Merck and Company]] rushed a 32-liter supply of the drug, in the form of culture liquid in which the Penicillium mold had been grown, from [[New Jersey]] to Boston in early December. The drug was crucial in combating [[staphylococcus]] bacteria which typically infect [[skin graft]]s. As a result of the success of penicillin in preventing infections, the US Government decided to support the production and distribution of penicillin to the armed forces.<ref>Stuart B.

During [[World War II]], penicillin made a major difference in the number of deaths and amputations caused by infected wounds among [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces, saving an estimated 12%–15% of lives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Availability was severely limited, however, by the difficulty of manufacturing large quantities of penicillin and by the rapid [[clearance (medicine)|renal clearance]] of the drug, necessitating frequent dosing. Penicillin is actively excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared from the body within three to four hours of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused.<ref name=Silverthorn2004>{{cite book
 | author=Silverthorn, DU. | title=Human physiology: an integrated approach. | edition=3rd | location=Upper Saddle River (NJ) | publisher=Pearson Education | year=2004 | isbn=0-8053-5957-5}}</ref>  This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The [[uricosuric]] agent [[probenecid]] proved to be suitable. When probenecid and penicillin are administered together, probenecid competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin's concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins resolved the supply issues, so this use of probenecid declined.<ref name=Silverthorn2004/> Probenecid is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.<ref name=AMH2006>{{cite book

===Human experimentation===
In a 1946 to 1948 [[Guatemala syphilis experiment|study in Guatemala]], U.S. researchers used [[prostitutes]] to infect prison inmates, insane asylum patients, and Guatemalan soldiers with syphilis and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), to test the effectiveness of penicillin in treating such diseases. They later tried infecting people with "direct inoculations made from syphilis bacteria poured into the men's [[penises]] and on forearms and faces that were slightly abraded ... or in a few cases through spinal punctures".<ref>{{Cite news |title=US apologizes for 1940s unethical research in Guatemala |author=Michael Cook |date=02 Oct 2010 |work=BioEdge |url=http://www.bioedge.org/index.php/bioethics/bioethics_article/9236}}</ref> Approximately 1300 people were infected as part of the study (including [[orphan]]ed children). The study was sponsored by the Public Health Service, the National Institutes of Health and the Pan American Health Sanitary Bureau (now the [[World Health Organization]]'s Pan American Health Organization) and the Guatemalan government. The team was led by [[John Charles Cutler]], who later participated in the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiments]]. Cutler chose to do the study in Guatemala because he would not have been permitted to do it in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. sorry for Guatemala syphilis experiment|work=CBC News|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/10/01/syphilis-guatemala.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. apologizes for newly revealed syphilis experiments done in Guatemala|author=Rob Stein|work=Washington Post|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100104457.html?hpid=topnews}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US sorry over deliberate sex infections in Guatemala |work=BBC News|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11454789}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US says sorry for 'outrageous and abhorrent' Guatemalan syphilis tests|author=Chris McGreal|work=Guardian|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/01/us-apology-guatemala-syphilis-tests|location=London}}</ref> The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues determined that 83 people died; however, it was not possible to determine whether the experiments were the direct cause of death.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. scientists knew 1940s Guatemalan STD studies were unethical, panel finds|author=Rob Stein|work=Washington Post|date=August 30, 2011|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-scientists-knew-1940s-guatemalan-std-studies-were-unethical-panel-finds/2011/08/26/gIQA2CxLoJ_story.html|location=?}}</ref>

===Developments from penicillin===
The narrow range of treatable diseases or "spectrum of activity" of the penicillins, along with the poor activity of the orally active phenoxymethylpenicillin, led to the search for derivatives of penicillin that could treat a wider range of infections. The isolation of 6-APA, the nucleus of penicillin, allowed for the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins, with various improvements over [[benzylpenicillin]] (bioavailability, spectrum, stability, tolerance).

The first major development was [[ampicillin]], which offered a broader spectrum of activity than either of the original penicillins. Further development yielded β-lactamase-resistant penicillins, including [[flucloxacillin]], [[dicloxacillin]], and [[methicillin]]. These were significant for their activity against β-lactamase-producing bacterial species, but were ineffective against the [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) strains that subsequently emerged.

Another development of the line of true penicillins was the antipseudomonal penicillins, such as [[carbenicillin]], [[ticarcillin]], and [[piperacillin]], useful for their activity against [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. However, the usefulness of the β-lactam ring was such that related antibiotics, including the [[mecillinam]]s, the [[carbapenem]]s and, most important, the [[cephalosporin]]s, still retain it at the center of their structures.<ref>
