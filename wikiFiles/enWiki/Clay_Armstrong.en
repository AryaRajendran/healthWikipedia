Armstrong was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1996, and the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]] (shared with [[Bertil Hille]] and [[Roderick MacKinnon]]) in 1999.<ref>[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/library/1999basic.shtml Lasker Award]</ref>
Armstrong was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref name=AAAS />
He won the 2001 Gairdner International Award.<ref>http://www.gairdner.org/awardrecipients/awardees2/20071998/2001awarde/clayarmstr</ref>

Armstrong is married to noted scientist [[Clara Franzini-Armstrong]].

==Ideas and influence==
Much of the current understanding of ion channel structure and function can be attributed to the work of Clay Armstrong. Armstrong provided the first general description of the K+ [[ion channel]] pore, including the fundamental ideas of a selectivity filter that can allow the rapid flow of K+ while excluding the flow of Na+ across the [[cell membrane]]; a wide inner vestibule; and a molecular gating element at the cytoplasmic side of the channel that controls the flow of ions through the pore.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inactivation of the Potassium Conductance and Related Phenomena Caused by Quaternary Ammonium Ion Injection in Squid Axons|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2225944/?tool=pubmed}}</ref> In addition, Armstrong's studies (with Francisco Bezanilla) that described the first measurement of charge movement associated with the activation of Na+-selective ion channels laid the groundwork for the current understanding of the molecular basis of electrical signaling in nerve and muscle cells.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charge movement associated with the opening and closing of the activation gates of the Na channels.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2203568/?tool=pubmed}}</ref>

A consistent feature of Armstrong's contributions is the quantitative nature of his work, combined with clear and concise descriptions of the underlying mechanism.
