'''Louise Joy Brown''' (born 25 July 1978) is the first [[homo sapiens|human]] to have been born after conception by [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], or IVF.

==Biography==
Louise Brown was born at [[Royal Oldham Hospital|Oldham General Hospital]], [[Oldham]], by planned [[Caesarean section]] delivered by [[Specialty registrar|registrar]] [[John Webster (doctor)|John Webster]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3077913.stm|work=BBC News|first=Martin|last=Hutchinson|title=I helped deliver Louise|date=24 July 2003}}</ref> She weighed 5 pounds, 12 ounces (2.608&nbsp;kg) at birth.<ref name=AFP/> Her parents, Lesley and John Brown, had been trying to conceive for nine years. They faced complications of [[Fallopian tube obstruction|blocked fallopian tubes]].<ref name=AFP>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iqs7hQfKFma-avGEqVGUGbLJ5xXQ "World's first IVF baby marks 30th birthday"], [[Agence France-Presse]], 23 July 2008. Retrieved 24 July 2008.</ref>  

On 10 November 1977, Lesley Brown underwent a procedure, later to become known as IVF, developed by [[Patrick Steptoe]] and [[Robert G. Edwards|Robert Edwards]]. Edwards was awarded the 2010 [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine for this work.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/research/05nobel.html|title=Pioneer of in Vitro Fertilization Wins Nobel Prize|first=Nicholas|last=Wade|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref> Although the media referred to Brown as a "test tube baby",<ref name="Hall">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,,1817639,00.html|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Sarah last=Hall|title=Louise Brown, first test tube baby, is pregnant|date=11 July 2006}}</ref> her [[Human fertilization|conception]] actually took place in a [[petri dish]]. Her younger sister, Natalie Brown, was also conceived through IVF four years later, and became the world's fortieth IVF baby. In May 1999, Natalie was the first IVF baby to give birth herself&mdash;naturally&mdash;to daughter Casey.<ref name=AFP/>

In 2004, Louise married nightclub doorman (bouncer) Wesley Mullinder. Dr. Edwards attended their wedding.<ref name=AFP/> Their son Cameron, conceived naturally,<ref name="Hall"/> was born on 20 December 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6260171.stm|work=BBC News|title=Baby son joy for test-tube mother|date=14 January 2007}}</ref>

John, Louise's father, died in 2006.<ref name="Grady">Denise Grady [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/health/lesley-brown-mother-of-first-test-tube-baby-dies-at-64.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries "Lesley Brown, Mother of World’s First ‘Test-Tube Baby,’ Dies at 64"], ''New York Times'', 23 June 2012</ref> Her mother, Lesley, died on 6 June 2012 in [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]] at the age of 64<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-18524232|work=Bristol news|publisher =BBC News|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref> due to complications from a [[gallbladder]] infection.<ref name="Grady"/>

==Ethical and religious issues==
Although the Browns knew the procedure was experimental, the doctors did not tell them that no case had yet resulted in a baby. This has raised questions of [[informed consent]].<ref>Robin Marantz Henig, ''Pandora's Baby'', Houghton Mifflin, 2004, p 134</ref> 

Shortly before the death of [[Pope Paul VI]], when asked for his reaction to Brown's birth, the patriarch of Venice, Cardinal Albino Luciani (later [[Pope John Paul I]]), expressed concerns about the possibility that artificial insemination could lead to women being used as "baby factories", but also refused to condemn the parents of the child.<ref>''Prospettive nel Mondo'',1 August 1978; Luciani, ''Opera Omnia'', vol. 8, pp. 571-72.</ref>
