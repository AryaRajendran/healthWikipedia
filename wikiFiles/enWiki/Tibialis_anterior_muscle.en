In human anatomy, the '''tibialis anterior''' is a [[muscle]] that originates in the upper two-thirds of the lateral surface of the [[tibia]] and inserts into the first [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiform]] and first [[metatarsus|metatarsal]] bones of the [[foot]]. Its acts to dorsiflex and invert the foot. This muscle is mostly located near the shin.

It is situated on the lateral side of the tibia; it is thick and fleshy above, tendinous below. The tibialis anterior overlaps the [[anterior tibial artery|anterior tibial]] vessels and deep [[common fibular nerve|peroneal nerve]] in the upper part of the leg.

== Function ==

The tibialis anterior muscle is the most medial muscle of the [[anterior compartment of leg|anterior compartment of the leg]]. The tibialis anterior is responsible for [[dorsiflexion|dorsiflexing]] and inverting the foot. The muscle has two origins, one being the lateral tibial condyle and the other being the upper lateral surface of the tibia, and inserts on the medial surface of the medial cuneiform and adjoining part of base of the first metatarsal of the foot allowing the toe to be pulled up and held in a locked position. It also allows for the ankle to be inverted giving the ankle horizontal movement allowing for some cushion if the ankle were to be rolled. It is innervated by the [[deep peroneal nerve]] and acts as both an antagonist and a synergist of the [[Tibialis posterior muscle|tibialis posterior]]. However, the most accurate antagonist of the tibialis anterior is the [[peroneus longus]]. The tibialis anterior aides in the activities of walking, running, hiking, kicking a ball, or any activity that requires moving the leg or keeping the leg vertical. It functions to stabilize the ankle as the foot hits the ground during the contact phase of [[walking]] (eccentric contraction) and acts later to pull the foot clear of the ground during the swing phase (concentric contraction). It also functions to 'lock' the ankle, as in toe-kicking a ball, when held in an isometric contraction.

Antagonists are [[plantarflexion|plantar-flexors]] of the posterior compartment such as [[soleus]] and [[gastrocnemius]].

Essentially, the movements of tibialis anterior are [[dorsiflexion]] and [[Inversion (kinesiology)|inversion]] of the ankle. However, actions of tibialis anterior are dependent on whether the foot is [[weight-bearing|weight bearing]] or not (closed or open kinetic chain). When the foot is on the ground the muscle helps to balance the leg and talus on the other tarsal bones so that the leg is kept vertical even when walking on uneven ground.

== Origin and insertion ==

It arises from the [[Lateral condyle of tibia|lateral condyle]] and upper half or two-thirds of the lateral surface of the [[body of tibia|body of the tibia]]; from the adjoining part of the [[interosseous membrane]]; from the deep surface of the fascia; and from the [[intermuscular septum]] between it and the [[extensor digitorum longus muscle|extensor digitorum longus]].

The fibers of this fusiform muscle are relatively parallel to the plane on insertion, ending in a [[tendon]], apparent on the anteriomedial dorsal aspect of the foot close to the ankle.

After passing through the most medial compartments of the [[superior extensor retinaculum of foot|transverse]] and [[inferior extensor retinaculum of foot|cruciate crural ligament]]s, it is inserted into the medial and under surface of the [[medial cuneiform bone]] and the base of the [[first metatarsal bone|first metatarsal]] bone.

== Variations ==

A deep portion of the muscle is rarely inserted into the [[Talus bone|talus]], or a tendinous slip may pass to the head of the first metatarsal bone or the base of the first phalanx of the [[hallux|great toe]].
