'''3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency''' also referred to as '''HMG-CoA lyase deficiency''' or '''Hydroxymethylglutaric aciduria''', is an [[Rare disease|uncommon inherited disorder]] in which the body cannot properly process the [[amino acid]] [[leucine]]. Additionally, the disorder prevents the body from making [[ketone]]s, which are used for energy during fasting.

==Presentation==
This disorder usually appears within the first year of life. The signs and symptoms of [[HMG-CoA lyase]] deficiency include [[vomiting]], [[dehydration]], [[lethargy]], [[convulsion]]s, and [[coma]]. When episodes occur in an infant or child, [[blood sugar]] becomes extremely low ([[hypoglycemia]]), and harmful compounds can build up and cause the blood to become too acidic ([[metabolic acidosis]]). These episodes are often triggered by an infection, fasting, strenuous exercise, or sometimes other types of stress.

==Differential diagnosis==
This condition is sometimes mistaken for [[Reye syndrome]], a severe disorder that develops in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as [[chicken pox]] or [[flu]]. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.

==Cause==
[[Mutation]]s in the ''HMGCL'' [[gene]] cause 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. The [[enzyme]] made by the ''HMGCL'' gene plays an essential role in breaking down dietary proteins and [[lipid|fats]] for energy. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for processing leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. This enzyme also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats. If a mutation in the ''HMGCL'' gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to process leucine or make ketones properly. A lack of ketones leads to hypoglycemia, and compounds called [[organic acids]] (which are formed as products of amino acid and fat breakdown) can cause the blood to become too acidic. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia impair tissue function, especially in the [[central nervous system]].

==Incidence==
This is a rare condition that has been reported in fewer than 100 individuals throughout the world. This condition is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern.
