'''Atypical ductal hyperplasia''', abbreviated '''ADH''', is the term used for a [[benign]] [[lesion]] of the breast that indicates an increased risk of [[breast cancer]].<ref name="urlUnderstanding Breast Changes - National Cancer Institute">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understanding-breast-changes/page6#F8 |title=Understanding Breast Changes - National Cancer Institute |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  

The name of the entity is descriptive of the lesion; ADH is characterized by cellular proliferation ([[hyperplasia]]) within one or two breast ducts and ([[histomorphology|histomorphologic]]) architectural abnormalities, i.e. the cells are arranged in an abnormal or atypical way.

In the context of a [[core biopsy|core (needle) biopsy]], ADH is considered an indication for a breast lumpectomy, also known as a surgical (excisional) biopsy, to exclude the presence of [[breast cancer]].<ref name="pmid7717215">{{cite journal |author=Liberman L, Cohen MA, Dershaw DD, Abramson AF, Hann LE, Rosen PP |title=Atypical ductal hyperplasia diagnosed at stereotaxic core biopsy of breast lesions: an indication for surgical biopsy |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=164 |issue=5 |pages=1111–3 |year=1995 |month=May |pmid=7717215 |doi= |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7717215}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
ADH, generally, is asymptomatic.  It usually comes to [[medical attention]] on a [[screening mammogram]], as a non-specific suspicious abnormality that requires a [[biopsy]].

==Diagnosis==
It is diagnosed based on tissue, e.g. a [[biopsy]].<ref name="pmid19098204">{{cite journal |author=Eby PR, Ochsner JE, DeMartini WB, Allison KH, Peacock S, Lehman CD |title=Frequency and upgrade rates of atypical ductal hyperplasia diagnosed at stereotactic vacuum-assisted breast biopsy: 9-versus 11-gauge |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=192 |issue=1 |pages=229–34 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19098204 |doi=10.2214/AJR.08.1342 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19098204}}</ref>  Histomorphologically, it has architectural changes seen in low-grade [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS), e.g. cribriform architecture, and like low-grade DCIS has minimal [[nuclear atypia]] and no [[necrosis]].

==Pathology==
ADH, [[cytopathology|cytologically]], [[Histopathology|architecturally]] and on a [[molecular pathology|molecular]] basis, is identical to a low-grade [[w:ductal carcinoma in situ|ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS);<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ghofrani | first1 = M. | last2 = Tapia | first2 = B. | last3 = Tavassoli | first3 = FA. | title = Discrepancies in the diagnosis of intraductal proliferative lesions of the breast and its management implications: results of a multinational survey. | journal = Virchows Arch | volume = 449 | issue = 6 | pages = 609–16 | month = Dec | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1007/s00428-006-0245-y | PMID = 17058097 }}</ref> however, it has a limited extent, i.e. is present in a very small amount (< 2 mm).

===Relation to low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ===

While the histopathologic features and molecular features of ADH are that of (low-grade) DCIS, its clinical behaviour, unlike low-grade DCIS, is substantially better; thus, the more aggressive treatment for DCIS is not justified.  In [[oncology]] in general, it is observed that tumour size is often strongly predictive of the clinical behaviour and, thus, a number of [[cancer]]s (e.g. [[adenocarcinoma of the lung]], papillary [[renal cell carcinoma]]) are defined, in part, on the basis of a minimum size.

==Treatment==
ADH, if found on a surgical (excisional) biopsy of a [[mammogram|mammographic]] abnormality, does not require any further treatment, only mammographic follow-up.  

If ADH is found on a core (needle) biopsy (a procedure which generally does not excise a suspicious mammographic abnormality), a surgical biopsy, i.e. a breast lumpectomy, to completely excise the abnormality and exclude breast cancer is the typical recommendation.

==Prognosis==
===Cancer risk for ADH on a core biopsy===
The rate at which breast cancer ([[ductal carcinoma in situ]] ''or'' [[Breast_cancer_classification#Histopathology|invasive mammary carcinoma (all breast cancer except DCIS and LCIS)]]) is found at the time of a surgical (excisional) biopsy, following the diagnosis of ADH on a core (needle) biopsy varies considerably from hospital-to-hospital (range 4-54%).<ref name=pmid20619647>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Deshaies | first1 = I. | last2 = Provencher | first2 = L. | last3 = Jacob | first3 = S. | last4 = Côté | first4 = G. | last5 = Robert | first5 = J. | last6 = Desbiens | first6 = C. | last7 = Poirier | first7 = B. | last8 = Hogue | first8 = JC. | last9 = Vachon | first9 = E. | title = Factors associated with upgrading to malignancy at surgery of atypical ductal hyperplasia diagnosed on core biopsy. | journal = Breast | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–5 | month = Feb | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.breast.2010.06.004 | PMID = 20619647 }}</ref>  In two large studies, the conversion of an ADH on core biopsy to breast cancer on surgical excision, known as "up-grading", is approximately 30%.<ref name=pmid20619647/><ref name=pmid16978969>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Margenthaler | first1 = JA. | last2 = Duke | first2 = D. | last3 = Monsees | first3 = BS. | last4 = Barton | first4 = PT. | last5 = Clark | first5 = C. | last6 = Dietz | first6 = JR. | title = Correlation between core biopsy and excisional biopsy in breast high-risk lesions. | journal = Am J Surg | volume = 192 | issue = 4 | pages = 534–7 | month = Oct | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2006.06.003 | PMID = 16978969 }}</ref>

===Cancer risk based on follow-up===
The [[relative risk]] of [[breast cancer]] based on a median follow-up of 8 years, in a [[case control study]] of [[United States|US]] [[registered nurse]]s, is 3.7.<ref name=pmid1734106>{{Cite journal  | last1 = London | first1 = SJ. | last2 = Connolly | first2 = JL. | last3 = Schnitt | first3 = SJ. | last4 = Colditz | first4 = GA. | title = A prospective study of benign breast disease and the risk of breast cancer. | journal = JAMA | volume = 267 | issue = 7 | pages = 941–4 | month = Feb | year = 1992 | doi =  | PMID = 1734106 }}</ref>
