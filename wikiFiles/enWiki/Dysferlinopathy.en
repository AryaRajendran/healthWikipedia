'''Dysferlinopathy''' is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of functional [[dysferlin]] protein due to mutations in the dysferlin gene.<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Liu J, Aoki M, Illa I, ''et al.'' |title=Dysferlin, a novel skeletal muscle gene, is mutated in Miyoshi myopathy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. |journal=Nat.

==Symptoms and Diagnosis==
The symptoms of dysferlinopathy usually manifest in early adulthood between the ages of 16 and 25 and primarily affect the [[skeletal muscle]] of the limbs and the [[limb girdles]] (hips and shoulders), leaving critical muscles such as the heart and diaphragm largely unaffected.<ref name="nguyen" /> The majority of dysferlinopathy patients become non-ambulant within 10–20 years of diagnosis, but life expectancy is normal.<ref name="nguyen" /> There is a large amount of variability in the age of onset and progression of the disease.<ref name="nguyen" /><ref>{{cite journal  | author=Weiler T, Bashir R, Anderson LV, ''et al.'' |title=Identical mutation in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B or Miyoshi myopathy suggests a role for modifier gene(s). |journal=Hum.

Although LGMD2B and MMD1 are both caused by dysferlin deficiency, a diagnosis of LGMD2B is given when weakness initially presents in the proximal muscles (thighs and upper arms)<ref name="lgmd">''Washington University, St. Louis: Neuromuscular Disease Center,'' "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy syndromes" [http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/musdist/lg.html#2b]</ref> while a diagnosis of MMD1 is given when weakness initially presents in the distal muscles (calves and lower arms).<ref name="distal">''Washington University, St. Louis: Neuromuscular Disease Center,'' "Distal weakness in myopathies" [http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/musdist/distal.html#miyoshi]</ref> In both cases, weakness eventually progresses to include both distal and proximal muscles.<ref name="lgmd" /><ref name="distal" /> Both LGMD2B and MMD1 are very difficult to diagnose,<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Wicklund MP and Hilton-Jones D. |title=The limb-girdle muscular dystrophies: Genetic and phenotypic definition of a disputed entity. |journal=Neurology |volume=60 | issue=8 |pages= 1230–1 |year= 2003 |pmid= 12707421 }}</ref> and patients are often misdiagnosed many times before they are successfully diagnosed with dysferlinopathy.
