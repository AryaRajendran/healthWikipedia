'''Rare lung cancers''' is a generic term referring to particularly uncommon [[histological]] variants of [[malignant]] [[neoplasms]] arising from the uncontrolled growth of genetically mutated cells in lung tissue.

==Definition of a "Rare" Cancer==
There is no universally accepted definition of a "[[rare disease]]" or "rare cancer".<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=NORD: The National Organization for Rare Disorders |date= |work= |publisher=[[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] |url=http://www.rarediseases.org}}</br>Rare Disease Act of 2002. {{uspl|107|280}}</ref><ref name='OrphanDrugAct'>[[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]]</ref>

==Classification of Lung Cancers==

Approximately 98% of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]], which are tumors composed of malignant cells with epithelial characteristics.<ref name="TravisTravis"/> LCLC's are one of 8 major groups of lung carcinomas recognized in WHO-2004:<ref name="who2004"/>

* [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]
* [[Small-cell carcinoma|Small Cell Carcinoma]]
* [[Adenocarcinoma of the lung]]
* [[Large-cell lung carcinoma|Large Cell Carcinoma]]
* [[Adenosquamous lung carcinoma|Adenosquamous Carcinoma]]
* [[Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung|Sarcomatoid Carcinoma]]
* [[Carcinoid|Carcinoid Tumor]]
* [[Salivary gland–like carcinoma of the lung|Salivary Gland-like Carcinoma]]

Each of these major groups (with the exception of adenosquamous carcinoma) contain at least one recognized "subtype" or "variant" with the particular [[histologic]]al and [[cytological]] characteristics qualifying them as part of that group, but which also present specific differences considered important enough for them to be delineated as a separate "subentity".<ref name="who2004"/>

Of the 8 major groups of lung carcinoma, only 4 are traditionally considered "common" forms — [[adenocarcinoma of the lung]], [[squamous cell lung carcinoma]], [[small cell lung carcinoma]], and [[large cell lung carcinoma]], which comprise (respectively) about 35–40%, 25–30%, 15–20% and 5–10% of all malignant lung [[neoplasms]] in the U.S.<ref name="who2004"/><ref name="TravisTravis"/> Under this (arbitrary) criterion, the other four major groups of lung carcinomas — and by definition, any of their subtypes and variants — would be considered "rare lung cancers". Furthermore, all [[mesenchymal]] cell-derived, hematopoietic cell-derived, [[germ cell]]-derived, and other unclassified cell types occurring as primary lung [[malignancies]] would also be considered "rare lung cancers".<ref name="who2004"/>
