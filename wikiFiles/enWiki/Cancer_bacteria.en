'''Cancer bacteria''' are [[bacteria]] infectious organisms that are known or suspected to cause cancer. While cancer-associated bacteria have long been considered to be opportunistic (i.e., infecting healthy tissues after cancer has already established itself), there is some evidence that bacteria may be directly [[carcinogen]]ic. The strongest evidence to date involves the bacterium ''H. pylori'' and its role in gastric cancer.  

[[Oncovirus]]es are [[virus|viral]] agents that are similarly suspected of causing cancer.

==History==

In 1890, the Scottish pathologist William Russell reported circumstantial evidence for the bacterial cause of cancer.<ref name="Russell">{{cite journal |author=Russell W |title=An address on a characteristic organism of cancer |journal=Brit Med J |volume=2 |issue= 1563|pages=1356–60 |year=1890 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.1563.1356 |pmid=20753194 |pmc=2208600}}</ref> In 1926, Canadian physician Thomas Glover reported that he could consistently isolate a specific bacterium from the neoplastic tissues of animals and humans.<ref name="Glover1926">{{cite journal | last =Glover | first =TJ | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Progress in Cancer Research | journal =Canada Lancet and Practitioner | volume =67 | issue = | pages =5 | publisher = | year =1926 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref> One review summarized Glover's report as follows:

{{quote|The author reports the isolation of a pleomorphic organism from various types of cancer which can be grown in pure cultures in its several phases.  He produced a serum from it which has given remarkable results in a series of 50 reported cases.  This is very important, if true.

Glover was asked to continue his work at the Public Health Service (later incorporated into the National Institutes of Health) completing his studies in 1929 and publishing his findings in 1930.<ref name="Glover1930">{{cite journal |author=Glover TJ |title=The bacteriology of cancer | journal =Canada Lancet and Practitioner | volume =74 | issue = | pages =92–111 | publisher = | year =1930 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref> He asserted that a vaccine or anti-serum manufactured from his bacterium could be used to treat cancer patients with varying degrees of success.<ref name="Glover1930"/> According to historical accounts, scientists from the Public Health Service challenged Glover’s claims and asked him to repeat his research to better establish quality control.<ref>Glover, T.J. and Engle, J.L. (1938) ''Studies in Malignancy''. New York: Murdock Foundation.</ref> Glover refused and opted to continue his research independently; not seeking consensus, Glover's claims and results led to controversy and are today not given serious merit.<ref name="LW">{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Unproven methods of cancer management: Livingston-Wheeler therapy | journal =CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians | volume =40 | issue = 2| pages =103–108 | publisher =American Cancer Society | year =1990 | url =http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.40.2.103/abstract | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.40.2.103| id = | accessdate = | pmid=1902135}}</ref>

In 1950, a Newark based physician named [[Virginia Livingston]] published a paper claiming that a specific ''Mycobacterium'' was associated with [[neoplasia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wuerthele-Caspe V, Alexander-Jackson E, Anderson JA, Hillier J, Allen RM, Smith LW |title=Cultural properties and pathogenicity of certain microorganisms obtained from various proliferative and neoplastic diseases |journal=Am.

In 1990 the [[National Cancer Institute]] published a review of Livingston's theories, concluding that her methods of classifying the cancer bacterium contained "remarkable errors" and it was actually a case of misclassification - the bacterium was actually ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]''.<ref name="LW"/>

Other researchers and clinicians who worked with the theory that bacteria could cause cancer, especially from the 1930s to the 1960s, included Eleanor Alexander-Jackson, [[William Coley]], William Crofton, [[Gunther Enderlein]], Franz Gerlach, [[Josef Issels]], Elise L'Esperance, Milbank Johnson, Arthur Kendall, [[Royal Rife]], [[Florence Seibert]], Wilhelm von Brehmer, and Ernest Villequez.<ref name=Hess>{{cite book|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Can Bacteria Cause Cancer?|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=01814735622}}</ref> Alexander-Jackson and Seibert worked with Virginia Livingston.
