In the [[inner ear]], '''stereocilia''' are the mechanosensing organelles of [[hair cells]], which respond to fluid motion in numerous types of animals for various functions, including hearing and balance. They are about 10–50 [[micrometers]] in length and share some similar features of [[microvilli]].<ref name="cite2">Caceci, T.

As acoustic sensors in [[mammals]], stereocilia are lined up in the [[Organ of Corti]] within the [[cochlea]] of the inner ear. In hearing, stereocilia transform the mechanical energy of sound waves into electrical signals for the hair cells, which ultimately leads to an excitation of the [[auditory nerve]]. Stereocilia are composed of cytoplasm with embedded bundles of cross-linked [[actin]] filaments. The actin filaments anchor to the terminal web and the top of the cell membrane and are arranged in grade of height.<ref name="cite1" /> When the [[stapes]] causes sound waves in the [[endolymphatic]] fluid in the cochlea, the stereocilia are deflected in a shearing motion, which results in the mentioned electrical signal for the [[hair cell]].

==Design and constellation==

Stereociliar design and constellation is important for mechanoelectrical transduction. Resembling hair-like projections, the stereocilia are arranged in bundles of 30-300.<ref name="cite6">{{cite journal |author=Rzadzinska AK, Schneider ME, Davies C, Riordan GP, Kachar B |title=An actin molecular treadmill and myosins maintain stereocilia functional architecture and self-renewal |journal=J. Cell Biol. |volume=164 |issue=6 |pages=887–97 |year=2004 |pmid=15024034 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200310055 |pmc=2172292}}</ref> Within the bundles the stereocilia are often lined up in several rows of increasing height, similar to a staircase. At the core of these hair-like stereocilia are rigid cross-linked actin filaments, which can renew every 48 hours. These actin filaments face their positive ends at the tips of the stereocilia and their negative ends at the base and can be up to 120 micrometres in length.<ref name="cite6" /> Filamentous structures, called tip links, connect the tips of stereocilia in adjacent rows in the bundles. The tip links are made up of nearly vertical fine filaments that run upward from the top end of a shorter stereocilia to its taller neighbor.<ref name="cite1" /> Tip links are analogous to tiny springs, which, when stretched, open cation selective channels thus allowing ions to flow across the cell membrane into the hair cells. They also are involved in the force transmission across the bundle and the maintenance of the hair bundle structure.<ref name="cite5">{{cite journal |author=Tsuprun V, Santi P |title=Structure of outer hair cell stereocilia side and attachment links in the chinchilla cochlea.|journal=J. Histochem. Cytochem. |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=493–502 |year=2002 |pmid=11897802 |doi=}}</ref>

==Mechanoelectrical transduction==

In the cochlea, a shearing movement between the [[Tectorial membrane (cochlea) | tectorial membrane]] and the [[basilar membrane]] deflects the stereocilia, affecting the tension on the tip-link filaments, which then open and close the non-specific ion channels.<ref name="cite1" /> When tension increases, the flow of ions across the membrane into the hair cell rises as well. Such influx of ions causes a depolarization of the cell, resulting in an electrical potential that ultimately leads to a signal for the auditory nerve and the brain. The identity of the mechanosensitive channels in the stereocilia is still unknown.

The transduction channels associated with stereocilia are thought to lie at the distal ends of the stereocilia.<ref>{{cite pmid | 6275046}}</ref> Deflections of the stereocilia in the direction of the tallest stereocilium leads to an increased rate of opening of nonspecific cation channels. This, in turn, causes receptor [[depolarization]] and leads to the excitement of the cochlear [[afferent nerve fiber|nerve afferent]]s that are located at the base of the [[hair cell]]. Deflections of the stereocilia in the opposite direction toward the shortest stereocilia causes transduction channels to close. In this situation, the hair cells become [[Hyperpolarization (biology) | hyperpolarized]] and the nerve afferents are not excited.<ref>{{cite pmid | 7840137}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid | 45121}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid | 2582113}}</ref> 

There are two different types of fluid that surround the hair cells of the inner ear. The [[endolymph]] is the fluid that surrounds the apical surfaces of hair cells. [[Potassium]] is the major cation in the endolymph and is thought to be responsible for carrying the receptor currents in the [[cochlea]]. [[Perilymph]] is found surrounding the sides and the bases of the hair cells. Perilymph is low in [[potassium]] and high in [[sodium]].<ref>{{cite pmid | 45121}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid | 661948}}</ref> The different ionic makeups of the surrounding fluid in addition to the [[resting potential]] of the hair cell creates a potential difference across the apical membrane of the hair cell, so potassium enters when transduction channels open. An influx of potassium ions depolarizes the cell and causes the release of a [[neurotransmitter]] that can initiate nerve impulses in the sensory neurons that synapse on the base of the hair cell.

== Destruction of stereocilia==

Stereocilia (along with the entirety of the hair cell) in [[mammal]]s can be damaged or destroyed by [[noise pollution|excessive loud noises]], disease, and [[toxin]]s and are not regeneratable.<ref name="cite6" /> [[Environmental noise]] induced [[hearing impairment]] is probably the most prevalent [[noise health effects|noise health effect]] according to the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]. Abnormal structure/organization of a bundle of stereocilia can also cause deafness and in turn create balance problems for an individual. In other vertebrates, if the hair cell is harmed, supporting cells will divide and replace the damaged hair cells.<ref name="cite1" />
