A '''goitre''' [[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|or]] '''goiter''' ([[Latin]] ''gutteria'', '''''struma'''''), is a swelling of the [[thyroid|thyroid gland]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000045602|goiter}}</ref> which can lead to a swelling of the neck or [[larynx]] (voice box). Goitre is a term that refers to an enlargement of the thyroid (thyromegaly) and can be associated with a thyroid gland that is functioning properly or not. 

Worldwide, over 90.54% cases of goitre are caused by [[iodine deficiency]].<ref name=Hoermann_2005>R. Hörmann: Schilddrüsenkrankheiten. ABW-Wissenschaftsverlag, 4. Auflage 2005, Seite 15-37. ISBN 3-936072-27-2</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Goitre associated with [[hypothyroidism]] or [[hyperthyroidism]] may be present with symptoms of the underlying disorder. For hyperthyroidism, the most common symptoms are weight loss despite increased appetite, and [[heat intolerance]]. However, these symptoms are often nonspecific and hard to diagnose.

==Morphology==
Regarding morphology, goitres may be classified either as the growth pattern or as the size of the growth:

;Growth pattern:
*Uninodular (struma uninodosa): can be either inactive or a toxic nodule
*Multinodular (struma nodosa): can likewise be inactive or toxic, the latter called [[toxic multinodular goitre]]
*Diffuse (struma diffuse): the whole thyroid appearing to be enlarged.

;Size:
* Class I (palpation struma): in normal posture of the head, it cannot be seen; it is only found by palpation.
* Class II: the struma is palpative and can be easily seen.
* Class III: the struma is very large and is retrosternal; pressure results in compression marks.

== Causes ==
Worldwide, the most common cause for goitre is [[iodine deficiency]], usually seen in countries that do not use iodized salt. [[Selenium]] deficiency is also considered a contributing factor. In countries that use [[iodized salt]], [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] is the most common cause.<ref name=Kumar>{{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc=|edition=8th}}</ref>

Goitre is more common among women, but this includes the many types of goitre caused by autoimmune problems, and not only those caused by simple lack of iodine.

==Treatment==
Goitre is treated according to the cause. If the [[thyroid gland]] is producing too much [[thyroid hormone|T3 and T4]], [[radioactive iodine]] is given to the patient to shrink the gland. If goitre is caused by [[iodine]] deficiency, small doses of iodide in the form of [[Lugol's Iodine]] or [[potassium iodide|KI solution]] are given. If the goitre is associated with an underactive [[thyroid]], thyroid supplements are used as treatment. In extreme cases, a partial or complete [[thyroidectomy]] is required.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/goiter/overview.html | work=The New York Times | title=Goiter - Simple}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Cretinnen aus Steiermark, 1819 gez. Loder, gest. Leopold Müller.jpg|thumb|left|Goitre (Styria), copper engraving, 1815]]
Chinese physicians of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) were the first to successfully treat patients with goitre by using the iodine-rich thyroid gland of animals such as sheep and pigs—in raw, pill, or powdered form.<ref>Temple, Robert. (1986). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention''. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Pages 133–134.</ref> This was outlined in Zhen Quan's (d. 643&nbsp;AD) book, as well as several others.<ref>Temple, Robert. (1986). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention''. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Page 134.</ref> One Chinese book, ''The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman'', asserted that iodine-rich [[sargassum]] was used to treat goitre patients by the 1st century BC, but this book was written much later.<ref>Temple, Robert. (1986). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention''. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Pages 134–135</ref>

In the 12th century, [[Zayn al-Din al-Jurjani]], a [[Islamic medicine|Persian physician]], provided the first description of [[Graves' disease]] after noting the association of goitre and [[exophthalmos]] in his ''Thesaurus of the Shah of Khwarazm'', the major medical dictionary of its time.<ref name=WNI>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1517|Basedow's syndrome or disease}} - the history and naming of the disease</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ljunggren JG |title=[Who was the man behind the syndrome: Ismail al-Jurjani, Testa, Flagani, Parry, Graves or Basedow? Use the term hyperthyreosis instead] |journal=Lakartidningen |volume=80 |issue=32–33 |page=2902 |year=1983 |month=August |pmid=6355710 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Al-Jurjani also established an association between goitre and [[palpitation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism|year=2003|volume=1|pages=43–45 [45]|title=Clinical Endocrinology in the Islamic Civilization in Iran|last=Nabipour|first=I.|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The disease was later named after Irish doctor [[Robert James Graves]], who described a case of goitre with exophthalmos in 1835. The German [[Karl Adolph von Basedow]] also independently reported the same constellation of symptoms in 1840, while earlier reports of the disease were also published by the Italians Giuseppe Flajani and Antonio Giuseppe Testa, in 1802 and 1810 respectively,<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|1471|Giuseppe Flajani}}</ref> and by the English physician Caleb Hillier Parry (a friend of [[Edward Jenner]]) in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hull G |title=Caleb Hillier Parry 1755-1822: a notable provincial physician |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=335–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9771526 |pmc=1296785 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

[[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) was the first person to propose a relationship between goitre and minerals (particularly lead) in drinking water.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/442424/Paracelsus/5505/Assessment "Paracelsus"] Britannica</ref> [[Iodine]] was later discovered by [[Bernard Courtois]] in 1811 from seaweed ash.

Goitre was previously common in many areas that were deficient in iodine in the [[soil]]. For example, in the [[English Midlands]], the condition was known as '''Derbyshire Neck'''. In the [[United States]], goitre was found in the [[Great Lakes]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and Intermountain regions. The condition now is practically absent in affluent nations, where [[Sodium chloride|table salt]] is [[Iodized salt|supplemented with iodine]]. However, it is still prevalent in [[India]], China<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html "In Raising the World’s I.Q., the Secret’s in the Salt"], article by Donald G. McNeil, Jr., December 16, 2006, ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> [[Central Asia]] and [[Central Africa]].

Goitre had been prevalent in the alpine countries for a long time. Switzerland reduced the condition by introducing [[iodised salt]] in 1922. The Bavarian [[tracht]] in  the Miesbach and Salzburg regions, which appeared in the 19th century, includes a [[choker]], dubbed ''Kropfband'' (struma band) which was used to hide either the goitre or the remnants of goitre surgery.<ref>[http://www.planet-wissen.de/pw/Artikel,,,,,,,FC2D0E589CC11ACEE0340003BA5E0905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.html Kropfband bei planet-wissen.de]</ref>

==Society and culture==
In the 1920s wearing bottles of iodine around the neck was believed to prevent goitre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/dimensions/issue8/iodine.html |title=ARCHIVED - Why take iodine? |publisher=Nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |date=2011-09-30 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}</ref>

=== Famous goitre sufferers ===
* Former [[President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and his wife [[Barbara Bush (First Lady)|Barbara Bush]] both were diagnosed with [[Graves' disease]] and goitres, within two years of each other. In the president's case, the disease caused [[hyperthyroidism]] and [[cardiac arrythmia|cardiac dysrhythmia]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=QLy42Bu3I6oC&pg=PT170&lpg=PT170&dq=George+H.+W.+Bush+Graves'+disease&source=web&ots=vltg1l208P&sig=MIiwGNrpBy7ojSzz3LvpSoZtM_E&hl=en Robert G.

=== Goitre in fiction ===
* In the [[Seinfeld]] episode "The Old Man," [[Elaine Benes]] volunteers to visit an elderly female shut-in and discovers that the woman has a massive goitre. The goitre never appears on screen, but Elaine's subplot revolves around her inability to speak to the woman without looking at it.  
* The character Big Nose in the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]  film ''[[Tangled]]'' suffers from a goitre, which he hopes will not interfere with his chances of finding love.<ref>[http://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/lyricstangled5.html Disney Lyrics]</ref>
* Charlotte Blacklock in the novel ''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' by Agatha Christie previously suffered from goitre.
* In the final scene of the movie ''[[Easy Rider]]'', the redneck in the pickup truck who shoots Wyatt and Billy has a large goitre on the right side of his face.
*In the film "[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]", The Goblin King, played by [[Barry Humphries]], is portrayed with a huge goitre hanging from his chin.

==Heraldry==
The coat of arms and crest of Die Kröpfner, of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] showed a man "afflicted with a large goitre", an apparent pun on the [[German language|German]] for the word.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Fox-Davies|first1= Arthur Charles|title=The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclopædia of Armory |year=1904 |publisher=Benjamin Blom, Inc. |location=New York and London |page=413}}</ref>
