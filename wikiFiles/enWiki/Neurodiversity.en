{{Autism rights movement}}

'''Neurodiversity''' is a concept that suggests that many diverse neurological conditions appear as a result of normal [[Human_genome#Genomic_variation_in_humans|variations]] in the human genome. This term was coined as a challenge to prevailing views of neurological diversity as inherently pathological, and it asserts that neurological differences be recognized and respected as a social category on a par with gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability status. Examples of these differences can include (but are not limited to) [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[dyscalculia]], [[dyslexia]], [[dyspraxia]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and others.

Neurodiversity is also an online international disability rights movement, and has been promoted primarily by the autistic self-advocate community (though other disability groups and disability rights communities are being included). This movement frames neurodiversity as a natural human variation rather than a disease. These advocates reject the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) cured, as they believe them to be authentic forms of human diversity, self-expression, and being. These advocates promote support systems (such as inclusion-focused services, accommodations, communication and assistive technologies, occupational training, and independent living support<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://autisticadvocacy.org/policy-advocacy/position-statements/|title="Position Statements"|publisher=Autistic Self Advocacy Network|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref>) that allow those who are neurologically different to live their lives as they are, rather than attempting to enforce uncritically accepted views of normalcy, or conform to a clinical ideal.<ref name=National Symposium on Neurodiversity at Syracuse University>{{Cite web|url=http://neurodiversitysymposium.wordpress.com/what-is-neurodiversity/|title="What is Neurodiversity?"|publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>

The term is attributed to [[Judy Singer]], a sociologist with Asperger syndrome,<ref name=Jaarsma/> and according to an article in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, was first published by Harvey Blume.<ref name=Solomon>{{Cite news|last=Solomon |first=Andrew |title=The Autism Rights Movement |date=May 25, 2008| work=New York Magazine | url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/ |accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref>  The earliest published use of the term appears in an article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' by Harvey Blume on September 30, 1998:<ref name=BlumeAtlantic>{{Cite news|author= Blume, Harvey |url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity |title= Neurodiversity |work= The Atlantic |date= September 30, 1998 |accessdate= November 7, 2007}}</ref>{{cquote| Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodiversity is for life in general. Who can say what form of wiring will prove best at any given moment? Cybernetics and computer culture, for example, may favor a somewhat autistic cast of mind.}}

Previous to this, although Blume did not make explicit use of the term ''neurodiversity'', he wrote in a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece on June 30, 1997:<ref name=BlumeNYT>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref> "Yet, in trying to come to terms with an NT [<nowiki/>[[neurotypical]]<nowiki/>]-dominated world, autistics are neither willing nor able to give up their own customs. Instead, they are proposing a new social compact, one emphasizing neurological pluralism. ... The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate [...] is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best."

Blume was an early advocate who predicted the role the internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement, saying:<ref name=BlumeMIT>{{Cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism & The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref> "There is a political dimension to this bond with the Internet. A project called CyberSpace 2000 is devoted to getting as many people as possible in the autistic spectrum hooked up by the year 2000, reason being that "the Internet is an essential means for autistic people to improve their lives, because it is often the only way they can communicate effectively. ... The challenge we will all be increasingly confronted with, on-line and off, is, to look at ourselves differently than we have before, that is, to accept neurological diversity."

Usage of the term has spread to a more general meaning; for example, the [[Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association]] (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental dyspraxia]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger syndrome]] and related conditions.<ref>[http://www.danda.org.uk/ Home page.]  DANDA.

==Autism spectrum==
Neurodiversity as a term captures the discovery that autism has an organic basis, representing a move away from the "mother-blaming" theories of the 20th century. Before the scientific advances in the 1980s, autism scholars popularized the belief that autism resulted from faulty parenting; stigma remained until recent genetic research debunked this myth.<ref name="genetics">Bumiller, Kristen. "The Geneticization of Autism: From New Reproductive Technologies to the Conception of Genetic Normalcy." Signs 34.4 (2009): 875-99. ''Chicago Journals''. University of Chicago Press.</ref> The [[causes of autism]] are contested and could result from a variety of factors that are genetic, biological, or environmental in nature; the shift is that the basis of autism is no longer believed to be social. The post-1980 geneticization of autism, wherein the condition is said to have an organic basis, was a change that prompted the idea of neurodiversity, wherein autism is framed a natural variance.<ref name="genetics"/>

The language surrounding neurodiversity has been controversial.<ref name=Jaarsma/> Those proposing the medical model label learning differences as "disorders, deficits, and dysfunctions". From this point of view, neurodiverse states are viewed as medical conditions that can and should be corrected.<ref name="Pollak">Pollak, David. 2009. “Neurodiversity in Higher Education.” John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</ref> Author David Pollak sees neurodiversity as an inclusive term that refers to the equality of all possible mental states. Still others reject the word because it sounds too medical and overshadows the needs of people with learning differences.<ref name="Pollak"/>

Proponents of neurodiversity strive to re-conceptualize autism and related conditions in society. Main goals of the movement include:
*acknowledging that neurodiverse people do not need a cure
*changing the language from the current “condition, disease, disorder, or illness”-based nomenclature
*broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living; acknowledging new types of autonomy
*giving neurodiverse individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.<ref name="article">Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn. "Autism, Neurodiversity and Equality Beyond the Normal." Journal of Ethics in Mental Health 2.2 (2007): 1-6. Web. 10  November 2009.</ref>

According to Jaarsma and Welin (2011), the "neurodiversity movement was developed in the 1990s by online groups of (high-functioning) autistic persons. It is now associated with the struggle for the civil rights of all those diagnosed with neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders".<ref name=Jaarsma/>

== Controversies ==

Some consider neurodiversity a "controversial concept" that "regards atypical neurological development as a normal human difference".<ref name=Jaarsma>{{cite journal |author=Jaarsma P, Welin S |title=Autism as a Natural Human Variation: Reflections on the Claims of the Neurodiversity Movement |journal=Health Care Anal |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21311979 |doi=10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 |url=http://www.imh.liu.se/avd_halsa_samhalle/filarkiv1/1.264263/JaarsmaWelin2011Autismasanaturalvariation.pdf |format=PDF |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=20–30}}</ref> 

There is controversy over the notion that the neurodiversity framework, if taken to its seemingly logical conclusion, would somehow remove the support that neurodiverse individuals currently receive. For instance, Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable.<ref name=Jaarsma />  They conclude that higher functioning individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis" and "some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics. The narrow conception of the neurodiversity claim should be accepted but the broader claim should not."<ref name=Jaarsma/>
