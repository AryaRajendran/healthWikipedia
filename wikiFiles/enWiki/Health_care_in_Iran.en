===Coverage===
{{See also|Social Security Organization (Iran)}}
The [[Iranian Constitution|constitution]] entitles Iranians to basic health care, and most receive subsidized prescription [[drugs]] and [[vaccination]] programs. An extensive network of public clinics offers basic care at low cost, and general and specialty hospitals operated by the [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education]] (MOHME) provide higher levels of care. In most large cities, well-to-do persons use private clinics and hospitals that charge high fees.<ref name='Iran'/> About 73% of all Iranian workers have [[health care]] and [[social security]] coverage.<ref name='Iran'/> In 2000, 94% of the population could access local health services, according to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]].

Iran has been very successful in training/educating the necessary human resources for its health system. The system of almost 30 years ago where the country was facing a shortage of all kinds of skilled personnel in the health and medical sector has been completely changed into one in which the necessary professionals now completely suffice the country’s needs. There are now 488 government funded hospitals in Iran. There were 0.5-1.1 [[physician]]s per 1000 population in 2004 according to various estimates (about 46 percent of physicians were women).<ref>http://www3.who.int/whosis/core/core_select_process.cfm?country=irn&indicators=healthpersonnel&intYear_select=all&language=en</ref>

===Health network===
{{See also|List of hospitals in Iran}}
[[Image:TUMS3.jpg|thumb|Shariati Hospital in [[Tehran]]|250px]]
Today the largest healthcare delivery network is owned and run by the [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education]] (MOHME) through its network of health establishments and medical schools in the country. MOHME is in charge of provision of healthcare services through its network, [[medical insurance]], [[medical education]], supervision and regulation of the [[healthcare system]] in the country, policymaking, production and distribution of pharmaceuticals, and research and development. Additionally, there are other parallel organisations such as Medical Services Insurance Organizations (MSIO) that have been established to act as a relief foundation as well as an [[insurance]] firm. Some hospitals, such as [[Mahak]] for children's cancer, are run by charitable foundations.

According to the last census that Statistical Centre of Iran undertook in 2003, Iran possesses 730 medical establishments (e.g. hospitals, clinics) with a total of 110,797 [[bed]]s, of which 488 (77,300 beds) are directly affiliated and run by the MOHME and 120 (11,301 beds) owned by the private sector and the rest belong to other organisations, such as the [[Social Security Organization (Iran)|Social Security Organization of Iran (SSO)]]. There were about seven [[nurse]]s and 17 hospital beds per 10,000 population.<ref name='Iran'/> 

An elaborate system of health network has been established which has ensured provision of [[Primary Health Centre|Primary Health Care]] (PHC) to the vast majority of public. However, access and [[availability]] of health care continues to be somewhat limited in [[Provinces of Iran|lesser developed provinces]] where the health indices are also lower as compared to national averages. The country is in an epidemiologic transition and faces double burden of the diseases. New emerging threats should also be considered. The [[Demography of Iran|demographic]] and epidemiological transition underway will have a significant effect on the pattern of morbidity and [[death|mortality]] in the near and distance future, especially as it affects the emergence of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[non-communicable disease]]s and the health problems of an [[aging]] population.

===Development===
{{See also|Science and technology in Iran|Economy of Iran}}
Although overall improvements have been achieved in all health areas since the 1979 revolution, the present challenging economic conditions of the country, combined with rapid advances in medical technology  and [[information technology]], individuals’ expectations, and the young [[Demographics of Iran|demographic]] of the population will undoubtedly challenge the sustainability of past improving trends. In this regard, Iran is implementing a reform that places [[preventive medicine]], the [[family doctor]] and the patient's electronic [[medical history]] at the center of Iran's health care system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Program/240811.html |title=PressTV - Family doctor in Iran |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}</ref> Moreover there is a considerable variation in the [[human development index]] and the human poverty index across different provinces in the country. Iran is the 19th country in medical research and is set to become the 10th within 10 years (2012).<ref>{{cite web|author= PressTV |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqh702QhmzE |title=Iran´s significant advances in Biosimilar & Biotechnology Medicines |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref>

====Health tourism====

Iran is also among the 12 countries with biological medicines technology and can serve as a [[health tourism]] center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presstv.com/detail/225321.html |title=Iran launches new biotechnological medicine line |publisher=PressTV |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2013-04-07}}</ref> 30,000 people come to Iran each year to receive medical treatment (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9010171549 |title=Fars News Agency :: Ahmadinejad Stresses Iran's Growing Medical Tourism Industry |publisher=English.farsnews.com |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref>

==Water and sanitation==
{{See also|Water supply and sanitation in Iran|List of reservoirs and dams in Iran}}
Iran has one of the highest percentages of population in the [[Middle East]] with access to safe [[drinking water]], with an esimated 92% of its people enjoying such access (nearly 100% in urban areas and about 80% in rural areas as of 2007).<ref>http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.wssinfo.org/pdf/country/IRN_wat.pdf Iran_islamic_rep_of_04.xls]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

There is a considerable shortfall in [[wastewater treatment]]; for example, in Tehran the majority of the population has no wastewater treatment, with raw [[sewage]] being injected directly into the [[groundwater]].<ref>[http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309092930/html/217.html]</ref>  As the [[water crisis]] deepens with [[overpopulation|an expanding population]], this [[pollution]] of groundwater causes increasing health risks.

==Nutrition==

[[Image:Percentage population undernourished world map.PNG|thumb|right|Percentage of national population suffering from [[malnutrition]], according to United Nations statistics.]]

Serious attention to the nutritional status of [[Iranian people]] has been made since [[Institute of Nutrition and Food Science of Iran]] (INFSI) was established by Dr. [[Habibollah Hedayat]] in 1961.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Despite the fact that Iran consists of an [[agrarian economy]]    {{Better source|date=June 2012}}, there is a high degree of [[malnutrition]] within the country. Approximately one fourth of all young children have [[stunted growth|stunted]] or wasted growth characteristics due to undernourishment;<ref>[http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/nutrition/ira-e.stm Nutrition country profiles: Iran summary]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> moreover, as an indicator of the poor [[food distribution]] capability, the percentage of undernourished children in [[village]]s is much higher. 

As an additional measure of [[public health]] and inefficient food distribution, about thirteen percent of the young people are classified as [[obese]], according to the same [[United Nations]] [[FAO]] sources. According to the government of Iran, about 60 percent of Iranians are [[overweight]] and 35 percent of women and 15 percent of men suffer from [[obesity]] in Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1140.html |title=Health Minister: 60% of Iranians are overweight |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref>

The [[soft drink]]s industry is valued at about $2 billion a year. Today, Iran produces about 3 billion litres of different types of soft drinks to address consumption of 46 litres per capita, and exports more than 12% of its production. Increased awareness with regards to the damages of carbonated drinks and sugar, and high levels of diabetes has created a move towards healthier products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atiehbahar.com/Resource.aspx?n=1000011 |title=Resources - Soft Drinks |publisher=Atieh Bahar |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref> {{undue-inline|reason=Is it related to the article?|date=June 2012}}

===Cholera===
[[Cholera]] has been a persistent problem in Iran. In the 2005 epidemic which involved loss of lives, state television warned people not to eat vegetables or buy ice blocks on the streets.<ref>[http://www.iranian.ws/cgi-bin/iran_news/exec/view.cgi/3/8985 Iran [[cholera]] outbreak takes more life, mullahs' regime clueless - Persian Journal Iran news, Latest iran news Iranian newspaper women zan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Salads were also banned in some restaurants. The 1998 epidemic involved considerably more cases and loss of life.

===HIV/AIDS===
{{See also|Prostitution in Iran
Increased drug use has driven up the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 2005 two-thirds of the official total of 9,800 HIV cases were attributed to drug use. Iran has established a national HIV treatment system, including 150 testing sites and a free needle exchange program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Iran.pdf |title=Country profile - US library of Congress |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref>

The rate of the epidemic in Iran is however still very low compared to international standards. Iran has a low prevalence of HIV infections with a rate of about 0.16 percent of the adult population (18,000 cases, officially) compared with 0.8 percent in North America (2008).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE4AO44O20081125 | work=Reuters | title=Iran fights rise in sexually transmitted HIV | date=2008-11-25}}</ref> But according to the [[WHO]], as of the end of 2009, there are more than 100,000 AIDS sufferers in Iran (approximately 0.135% of the Iranian population).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=112423&sectionid=3510212 |title='Iran has 100,000 HIV-infected people' |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref>

[[Drug addiction]] constitutes a major health problem. Iran is situated along one of the main trafficking routes for cannabis, [[heroin]], [[opium]] and [[morphine]] produced in [[Afghanistan]], and designer drugs have also found their way into the local market in recent years.

===Smoking===
{{See also|Taxation in Iran#Smuggling|l1=Smuggling in Iran}}
Iran has implemented a strict [[smoking ban]] in all public places (2007). According to the new law, [[smoking]] is prohibited in all public organizations, hotels, restaurants, tea houses and coffee shops. Also forbidden is the offering and smoking of ''[[ghalyun]]'', the traditional Persian [[waterpipe]], which is a must in Iranian [[tea house]]s. A smoking ban for all car drivers nationwide was implemented since March 2006, and although offenders could face fines, the ban was widely ignored by the drivers. Also selling tobacco products to anyone under 18 would result in confiscation of the vendor's tobacco products and a cash fine. Repeated violations would lead to high cash fines. 

About 20% of adult male and 4.5% of adult female population in the country smoke tobacco (12 million smokers according to some estimates).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-235/0812241246201050.htm |title=وب سایتهای ایرنا - Irna |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jun/1006.html |title=25% of death in Iran caused by tobacco: Minister |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref> 60,000 Iranians die directly or indirectly due to smoking every year (2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smokersclubinc.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1834 |title=Iran Compulsory Rules |publisher=The Smokers Club, Inc. |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref> Smoking is responsible for 25% of death in the country.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Approx. 54bn-60bn cigarettes are believed to be consumed annually in Iran.<ref name="New law"/> Around 2.7bn cigarettes are smuggled into Iran annually, according to officials from the state-owned [[Iranian Tobacco Company]] (ITC), on top of another 26.7bn which are imported legally (2008).<ref>{{Cite journal| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=IRAN: Food, Beverages and Tobacco Forecast| title=Economist Intelligence Unit| editor-first=| editor-last=| publisher=| place=| pages=| date=August 18, 2008| year=| id= | contribution-url=| format=| accessdate=2009-07-09| editors=| postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The Islamic Republic of Iran has a comprehensive and effective program of [[family planning]]. While Iran's population grew at a rate of more than 3% per year between 1956 and 1986, the growth rate began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s after the government initiated a major population control program. By 2007 the growth rate had declined to 0.7 percent per year, with a birth rate of 17 per 1,000 persons and a death rate of 6 per 1,000.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567300_3/Iran.html MSN Encarta Encyclopedia entry on Iran - People and Society], [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html#People CIA World factbook 2007].

==Leading causes of mortality==
{{See also|Transport in Iran#Road accidents|l1=Road accidents in Iran}}

In the early 2000s the main natural causes of death have been [[cardiovascular]] disease and [[cancer]].

According to [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education]], in 2003, 41% of total deaths were due to diseases of the circulatory system. [[Myocardial infarction]] as the cause of 25% of deaths was the leading cause of mortality among the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranpharmaceutical.com/iran-health-indicators-and-health-care-system.html |title=Iran Health Indicators and Health Care System |publisher=Iranpharmaceutical.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref> 

[[Substance dependence|Addiction]] is the fourth major cause of death in Iran following [[Transport in Iran#Road accidents|road accidents]], [[heart disease]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0810278680174556.htm |title=وب سایتهای ایرنا - Irna |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref>

From 2001 to 2010, over 438,000 Iranians have died from "unnatural deaths" such as electric shocks, gas poisoning, and drug intoxication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/12/aug/1075.html |title=Over 0.4 million lost lives in Iran in 10 years due to accidents |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}</ref>

==Pharmaceuticals==

The pharmaceutical industry in Iran began in its modern form in 1920 when the [[Pasteur Institute]] was founded. Iran has a well-developed [[pharmaceutical]] production capability, however, the country still relies on imports for raw materials and many specialized drugs. The standards regarding pharmaceutical products in Iran are determined and modified by the ''Pharmacopeia Council''.

Iran’s [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education]] (MOHME) has a mission to provide access to sufficient quantities of safe, effective and high quality medicines that are affordable for the entire population. Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has adopted a full generic-based [[National Drug Policy]] (NDP), with local production of [[essential drugs]] and [[vaccines]] as one of the main goals.<ref>[http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2773/html/economy.htm Iran-Daily: Biggest Pharmaceutical Plant to Open Soon]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

Although over 85 percent of the population use an insurance system to reimburse their drug expenses, the government heavily subsidizes pharmaceutical production/importation in order to increase affordability of medicines, which tends also to increase overconsumption, overprescription and misuse of drugs, such as [[antibiotics#Antibiotic resistance|antibiotics]]. The regulatory environment of the country is rather strict on the import of drugs and pharmaceuticals towards companies that intend to enter into the market for the first time. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education is the main stakeholder of pharmaceutical affairs in the country.

==Medical equipment==<!-- This section is linked from [[Economy of Iran]] -->
{{See also|Industry of Iran|Foreign Direct Investment in Iran}}
The Department of Medical Equipments in the [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education]] (MOHME) is responsible for supervising imports in this segment, but the import and distribution of such equipment is mostly handled by the [[private sector]]. Iran has undergone the primary stages of development in terms of [[industrialisation]] and a rather strong [[Industry of Iran|indigenous manufacturing capability]] exists in the country. Therefore one can expect to find a handful of local producers for basic [[medical equipment]], making it very hard to penetrate into the Iranian market for similar imported ones. 

''Iran MED'' and ''Iran LAB'' are the main annual exhibitions relating to medical and laboratory equipment in Tehran.<ref>[http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/3421/html/science.htm#s385215 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> In 2009, approximately $3.1 billion worth of drugs and medical products were consumed in Iran. This shows an 80% increase from 3 years ago.<ref name="turquoisepartners.com"/> Iran’s per capita consumption is $21, as opposed to the global average of $94 because [[Iranian Economic Reform Plan#Subsidy reform plan|Iran subsidizes heavily its medical and pharmaceutical industry]].<ref name="turquoisepartners.com"/> In 2009, Iran exported $74 million worth of "medical products" to countries such as [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Russia]].<ref name="turquoisepartners.com"/>

[[U.S. sanctions against Iran]] do not apply to medical equipment or pharmaceuticals. There are over 100 Iranian companies representing the international suppliers in this market, handling both promotion and the after-sales service of the products. Iran is a [[mature market]] when it comes to [[medical equipment]]. Most of the major international players in this sector are present in the Iran market:
