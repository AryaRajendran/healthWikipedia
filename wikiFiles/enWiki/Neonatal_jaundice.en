'''Neonatal jaundice'''  or '''Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia''', or '''Neonatal icterus''' (from the Greek word ''ίκτερος''), attributive adjective: '''icteric''', is a yellowing of the [[skin]] and other tissues of a newborn [[infant]]. A [[bilirubin]] level of more than 85&nbsp;umol/l (5&nbsp;mg/dL) manifests clinical [[jaundice]] in [[neonates]] whereas in adults a level of 34&nbsp;umol/l (2&nbsp;mg/dL) would look [[icteric]]. In newborns, jaundice is detected by blanching the skin with digital pressure so that it reveals underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue.<ref name="family">{{cite journal|url=http://www.osteopathicfamilyphysician.org/article/S1877-573X(12)00187-6/abstract|title=An osteopathic approach to reduction of readmissions for neonatal jaundice|last1=Click|first1=R|last2=Dahl-Smith|first2=J|last3=Fowler|first3=L|last4=DuBose|first4=J|last5=Deneau-Saxton|first5=M|last6=Herbert|first6=J|journal=Osteopathic Family Physician|volume=5|issue=1|year=2013|month=January|doi=10.1016/j.osfp.2012.09.005}}</ref>  Jaundiced newborns have an apparent icteric [[sclera]], and yellowing of the face, extending down onto the chest.

Notoriously inaccurate [[rules of thumb]] have been applied to the [[physical exam]] of the jaundiced infant.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Some include estimation of serum [[bilirubin]] based on appearance. One such rule of thumb includes infants whose jaundice is restricted to the face and part of the trunk above the [[Navel|umbilicus]], have the [[bilirubin]] less than 204&nbsp;umol/l (12&nbsp;mg/dL) (less dangerous level). Infants whose palms and soles are yellow, have serum bilirubin level over 255&nbsp;umol/l (15&nbsp;mg/dL) (more serious level).  Studies have shown that trained examiners assessment of levels of jaundice show moderate agreement with icterometer bilirubin measurements.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In infants, jaundice can be measured using [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] or non-invasive methods. In non-invasive methods, Ingram icterometers and transcutaneous bilirubinometers are used.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Classification ==
=== Physiological jaundice ===
Most [[infant]]s develop visible jaundice due to elevation of unconjugated bilirubin concentration during their first week. This common condition is called physiological jaundice.  This pattern of [[hyperbilirubinemia]] has been classified into two functionally distinct periods.

;Phase one
# Term infants - jaundice lasts for about 10 days with a rapid rise of serum bilirubin up to 204&nbsp;umol/l (12&nbsp;mg/dL).
# Preterm infants - jaundice lasts for about two weeks, with a rapid rise of serum bilirubin up to 255&nbsp;umol/l (15&nbsp;mg/dL).
;Phase two - bilirubin levels decline to about 34&nbsp;umol/l (2&nbsp;mg/dL) for two weeks, eventually mimicking adult values.
#Preterm infants - phase two can last more than one month.
#Exclusively breastfed infants - phase two can last more than one month.

==== Causes ====
Mechanisms involved in physiological jaundice are mainly:
*Relatively low activity of the enzyme [[glucuronosyltransferase]] which normally converts [[unconjugated bilirubin]] to conjugated bilirubin that can be excreted into the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=jain2002/> Before birth, this enzyme is actively down-regulated, since bilirubin needs to remain unconjugated in order to cross the placenta to avoid being accumulated in the fetus.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1542/peds.2006-3669}}</ref> After birth, it takes some time for this enzyme to gain function.
*Shorter life span of fetal red blood cells,<ref name=jain2002>[http://books.google.se/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ulR9AuVcJOIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA45 Page 45] in: Obstetrics & Gynaecology, by B. Jain, 2002. ISBN: 8180562107, 9788180562105</ref> being approximately 80 to 90 days in a full term infant,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1440-1754.1979.tb01197.x}}</ref> compared to 100 to 120 days in adults.
*Relatively low conversion of bilirubin to [[urobilinogen]] by the [[intestinal flora]], resulting in relatively high absorption of bilirubin back into the circulation.<ref name=jain2002/>

===Pathological Jaundice of Neonates (Unconjugated Pathological Hyperbilirubinemia)===
Any of the following features characterizes pathological jaundice:
#Clinical jaundice appearing in the first 24 hours or greater than 14 days of life.
#Increases in the level of total bilirubin by more than 8.5&nbsp;umol/l (0.5&nbsp;mg/dL) per hour or (85&nbsp;umol/l) 5&nbsp;mg/dL per 24 hours.
#Total bilirubin more than 331.5&nbsp;umol/l (19.5&nbsp;mg/dL) ([[hyperbilirubinemia]]).
#Direct bilirubin more than 34&nbsp;umol/l (2.0&nbsp;mg/dL).

===Differentiating Physiological and Pathological Jaundice===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
The aim of clinical assessment is to distinguish physiological from pathological jaundice. 
The signs which help to differentiate pathological jaundice of neonates from physiological jaundice of neonates are the presence of intrauterine growth restriction, stigma of intrauterine infections (e.g. [[cataracts]], [[microcephaly]], [[hepatosplenomegaly]] etc.), [[cephalhematoma]], bruising, signs of intraventricular hemorrhage, etc. History of illness is noteworthy. Family history of jaundice and anemia, family history of neonatal or early infant death due to liver disease, maternal illness suggestive of viral infection (fever, rash or [[lymphadenopathy]]), maternal drugs (e.g. [[sulphonamide_(medicine)|sulphonamides]], anti-malarials causing hemolysis in [[G6PD deficiency]]) are suggestive of pathological jaundice in neonates.

==Causes of jaundice==
In neonates, jaundice tends to develop because of two factors - the breakdown of [[fetal hemoglobin]] as it is replaced with [[Hemoglobin|adult hemoglobin]] and the relatively immature hepatic metabolic pathways which are unable to conjugate and so excrete bilirubin as quickly as an adult.  This causes an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood ([[hyperbilirubinemia]]), leading to the symptoms of jaundice.

If the neonatal jaundice does not clear up with simple [[phototherapy]], other causes such as [[biliary atresia]], PFIC, bile duct paucity, [[Alagille syndrome]], alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, and other pediatric liver diseases should be considered.  The evaluation for these will include blood work and a variety of diagnostic tests.  Prolonged neonatal jaundice is serious and should be followed up promptly.

Severe neonatal jaundice may indicate the presence of other conditions contributing to the elevated bilirubin levels, of which there are a large variety of possibilities (see below).  These should be detected or excluded as part of the [[differential diagnosis]] to prevent the development of complications.  They can be grouped into the following categories:

"Breastfeeding jaundice" or "lack of breastfeeding jaundice," is caused by insufficient breast milk intake,<ref name="GarfunkelKaczorowski2002">{{cite book|author1=Lynn C. Garfunkel|author2=Jeffrey Kaczorowski|author3=Cynthia Christy|title=Mosby's pediatric clinical advisor: instant diagnosis and treatment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3m0JEvOQSlEC&pg=PA200|accessdate=14 June 2010|year=2002|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-01049-8|pages=200–}}</ref> resulting in inadequate quantities of bowel movements to remove bilirubin from the body. This can usually be ameliorated by frequent breastfeeding sessions of sufficient duration to stimulate adequate milk production. Passage of the baby through the [[vagina]] during birth helps stimulate milk production in the mother's body, so infants born by [[cesarean section]] are at higher risk for this condition.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Philadelphia Guide to a Healthy Birth|url=http://www.womencarepa.org/include/PhiladelphiaGuideToAHealthyBirth08-09.pdf}}</ref>

====Breast milk jaundice====
Whereas breast ''feeding'' jaundice is a mechanical problem, breast ''milk'' jaundice is more of a biochemical problem. The term applies to jaundice in a newborn baby.

* First, at birth, the gut is sterile, and normal gut flora takes time to establish. The bacteria in the adult gut convert conjugated [[bilirubin]] to [[stercobilinogen]] which is then oxidized to [[stercobilin]] and excreted in the stool. In the absence of sufficient bacteria, the bilirubin is de-conjugated by brush border β-glucuronidase and reabsorbed. This process of re-absorption is called [[enterohepatic circulation]]. It has been suggested that bilirubin uptake in the gut (enterohepatic circulation) is increased in breast fed babies, possibly as the result of increased levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in breast milk.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kumral|first=A|coauthors=Ozkan H, Duman N, et al.|title=Breast milk jaundice correlates with high levels of epidermal growth factor|journal=Pediatr Res|year=2009|volume=66|pages=218–21}}</ref>

* Second, the breast-milk of some women contains a metabolite of progesterone called [[3-alpha-20-beta pregnanediol]]. This substance inhibits the action of the enzyme uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) [[glucuronyl transferase]] responsible for conjugation and subsequent excretion of bilirubin. In the newborn liver, activity of glucuronyl transferase is only at 0.1-1% of adult levels, so conjugation of bilirubin is already reduced. Further inhibition of bilirubin conjugation leads to increased levels of bilirubin in the blood.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arias|first=IM|coauthors=Gartner LM, Seifter S, Furman M|title=Prolonged neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associated with breast feeding and a steroid, pregnane-3(alpha), 20(beta)-diol in maternal milk that inhibits glucuronide formation in vitro.|journal=J Clin Invest|year=1964|volume=43|pages=2037–47}}</ref> However, these results have not been supported by subsequent studies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=J F|coauthors=Hughes I, Verrier Jones ER, Gaskell S, Pike AW.|title=Pregnanediols and breast-milk jaundice.|journal=Arch Dis Child|year=1981|volume=56|pages=474–76}}</ref>

* Third, an enzyme in breast milk called [[lipoprotein lipase]] produces increased concentration of nonesterified free fatty acids that inhibit hepatic glucuronyl transferase, which again leads to decreased conjugation and subsequent excretion of bilirubin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poland|first=R L|coauthors=Schultz GE, Gayatri G|title=High milk lipase activity associated with breastmilk jaundice.|journal=Pediatr Res|year=1980|volume=14|pages=1328–31}}</ref> 

Despite the advantages of breast feeding, there is a strong association of breast feeding with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and thus risk of [[kernicterus]], though this is uncommon. Serum bilirubin levels may reach as high as 30&nbsp;mg/dL. Jaundice should be managed either with phototherapy or with exchange blood transfusion as is needed. Breast feeds however need not be discontinued. The child should be kept well hydrated and extra feeds given.

==Non-invasive measurement of jaundice==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
'''Clinical Assessment'''

This method is more accurate and less subjective in estimating jaundice. 

'''Ingram icterometer''': In this method a piece of transparent plastic known as '''Ingram icterometer''' is used. Ingram icterometer is painted in five transverse strips of graded yellow lines. The instrument is pressed against the nose and the yellow colour of the blanched skin is matched with the graded yellow lines and biluribin level is assigned.  

'''Transcutaneous bilirubinometer''': This is hand held, portable and rechargeable but expensive and sophisticated. When pressure is applied to the photoprobe, a xenon tube generates a strobe light, and this light passes through the subcutaneous tissue. The reflected light returns through the second fiber optic bundle to the spectrophotometric module. The intensity of the yellow color in this light, after correcting for the hemoglobin, is measured and instantly displayed in arbitrary units.

==Treatment==
The bilirubin levels for initiative of phototherapy varies depends on the age and health status of the newborn.  However, any newborn with a total serum bilirubin greater than 359 umol/l ( 21&nbsp;mg/dL) should receive phototherapy.<ref name =AAP2004>{{cite journal |author= |title=Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=297–316 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15231951 |doi= 10.1542/peds.114.1.297|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15231951 |author1= American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Hyperbilirubinemia}}</ref>

===Phototherapy===
The use of phototherapy was first discovered, accidentally, at Rochford Hospital in Essex, England.  The ward sister (Charge Nurse) of the premature baby unit, firmly believed that the infants under her care benefited from fresh air and sunlight in the courtyard.  Although this led to the first noticing of jaundice being improved with sunlight, further studies only progressed when a vial of blood sent for bilirubin measurement sat on a windowsill in the lab for several hours.  The results indicated a much lower level of bilirubin than expected based on the patient's visible jaundice.  Further investigation lead to the determination that blue light, wavelength of 420-448&nbsp;nm, oxidized the bilirubin to biliverdin, a soluble product that does not contribute to [[kernicterus]].  Although some pediatricians began using phototherapy in the United Kingdom following Dr. Cremer's publishing the above facts in the ''Lancet'' in 1958, most hospitals only began to regularly use phototherapy ten years later when an American group independently made the same discovery.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/adc.50.11.833| issn = 0003-9888| volume = 50| issue = 11| pages = 833–836| last = Dobbs| first = R H| coauthors = R J Cremer| title = Phototherapy.| journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood| date = 1975-11| pmid = 1108807| pmc = 1545706}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(58)91849-X| issn = 0140-6736| volume = 271| issue = 7030| pages = 1094–1097| last = Cremer| first = R.

[[File:Jaundice phototherapy.jpg|thumb|280px|right|newborn infant undergoing (white light) phototherapy to treat neonatal jaundice]]
Infants with neonatal jaundice are treated with colored light called phototherapy. [[Physicians]] randomly assigned 66 infants 35 weeks of gestation to receive phototherapy.  After 15±5 the levels of bilirubin, a yellowish bile pigment that in excessive amounts causes jaundice, were decreased down to 0.27±0.25&nbsp;mg/dl/h in the blue light.  This suggests that blue light therapy helps reduce high bilirubin levels that cause neonatal jaundice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Amato M, Inaebnit D |title=Clinical usefulness of high intensity green light phototherapy in the treatment of neonatal jaundice |journal=Eur. J. Pediatr. |volume=150 |issue=4 |pages=274–6 |year=1991 |month=February |pmid=2029920 |doi= 10.1007/BF01955530|url=}}</ref>   

Exposing infants to high levels of colored light changes trans-bilirubin to the more water soluble cis-form which is excreted in the bile. Scientists studied 616 capillary blood samples from jaundiced newborn infants.  These samples were randomly divided into three groups.  One group contained 133 samples and would receive phototherapy with blue light.  Another group contained 202 samples would receive room light, or white light.  The final group contained 215 samples, and were left in a dark room. The total bilirubin levels were checked at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours.  There was a significant decrease in bilirubin in the first group exposed to phototherapy after two hours, but no change occurred in the white light and dark room group.  After 6 hours, there was a significant change in bilirubin level in the white light group but not the dark room group.  It took 48 hours to record a change in the dark room group’s bilirubin level. Phototherapy is the most effective way of breaking down a neonate’s bilirubin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leung C, Soong WJ, Chen SJ |title=[Effect of light on total micro-bilirubin values in vitro] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei) |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=41–5 |year=1992 |month=July |pmid=1326385 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

[[Phototherapy]] works through a process of isomerization that changes trans-bilirubin into the water-soluble cis-bilirubin isomer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stokowski LA |title=Fundamentals of phototherapy for neonatal jaundice |journal=Adv Neonatal Care |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=303–12 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17208161 |doi=10.1016/j.adnc.2006.08.004 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ennever JF, Sobel M, McDonagh AF, Speck WT |title=Phototherapy for neonatal jaundice: in vitro comparison of light sources |journal=Pediatr. Res. |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=667–70 |year=1984 |month=July |pmid=6540860 |doi= 10.1203/00006450-198407000-00021|url=}}</ref>

In phototherapy, blue light is typically used because it is more effective at breaking down bilirubin (Amato, Inaebnit, 1991). Two matched groups of newborn infants with jaundice were exposed to intensive green or blue light phototherapy.  The efficiency of the treatment was measured by the rate of decline of serum bilirubin, which in excessive amounts causes jaundice, concentration after 6, 12 and 24 hours of light exposure.  A more rapid response was obtained using the blue lamps than the green lamps.  However, a shorter phototherapy recovery period was noticed in babies exposed to the green lamps(1). Green light is not commonly used because exposure time must be longer to see dramatic results(1).

Ultraviolet light therapy may increase the risk of skin moles, in childhood. While an increased number of moles is related to an increased risk of skin cancer,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pullmann H, Theunissen A, Galosi A, Steigleder GK |title=[Effect of PUVA and SUP therapy on nevocellular nevi (author's transl)] |language=German |journal=Z.

Rather, it is simply a specific frequency of blue light that does not carry these risks.

Increased feedings help move bilirubin through the neonate’s metabolic system.<ref>Wood, S. (2007, March). Fact or fable?. Baby Talk, 72(2).</ref>

The light can be applied with overhead lamps, which means that the baby's eyes need to be covered, or with a device called a [[Biliblanket]], which sits under the baby's clothing close to its skin.

===Exchange transfusions===
Much like with phototherapy the level at which [[exchange transfusion]]s should occur depends on the health status and age of the newborn.  It should however be used for any newborn with a total serum bilirubin of greater than 428 umol/l ( 25&nbsp;mg/dL ).<ref name=AAP2004/>
