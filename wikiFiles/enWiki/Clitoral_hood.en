In [[female human anatomy]], the '''clitoral hood''' (also called '''preputium clitoridis''' and '''clitoral prepuce''') is a fold of [[skin]] that surrounds and protects the [[clitoral glans|glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; it also covers the external shaft and develops as part of the [[labia minora]] and is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[foreskin]] (equally called ''prepuce'') in [[Sex organ|male genitals]].<ref name="Sloane">{{cite book|first= Ethel|last=Sloane | title = Biology of Women | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2002|page=32| accessdate = August 25, 2012| isbn = 0766811425, 9780766811423 |url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kqcYyk7zlHYC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=Helen+Connell+clitoris+1998&source=bl&ots=zHm3mmxIn1&sig=LiqbCAhXtFpVL3ID9KBMf-fpQzA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lDY5UMvVCIiFrAGbmoHgAg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Helen%20Connell%20clitoris%201998&f=false}}</ref><ref name="Crooks">{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Crooks |first2= Karla |last2=Baur| title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | pages = 54 | accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0495812943, 9780495812944| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=The+clitoral+glans+in+particular+is+highly+sensitive&source=bl&ots=KpBrboLXy9&sig=TSArVcq-NnC4QR9PiCzeUWGzRMc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ALg_UJbrCKLW2gWp4YCgDQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=The%20clitoral%20glans%20in%20particular%20is%20highly%20sensitive&f=false}}</ref><ref name="Mulhall">{{cite book | first = John P. | last = Mulhall | editors=John P.

The clitoral hood, like the foreskin is composed of [[Mucocutaneous zone|muccocutaneous]] tissues, which are tissues that are between the [[mucosa]] and the skin.  These tissues may have immunological importance, as they may be a point of entry of mucosal vaccines.<ref name="Cold and Taylor">{{cite journal|first=C.J.|last=Cold |first2= T.R. |last2=Taylor | title = The Prepuce | journal= [[British Journal of Urology]] | year =1999 | volume=83(1)| pages=34-44}}</ref> The clitoral hood is also important not only in protection of the clitoral glans, but also in pleasure, as it is an erogenous tissue.<ref name="Cold and Taylor"/>

==Development and variation==
[[Image:EdSim Clitoris anatomy.jpg|thumb|left|Shows the sub-areas of the clitoris. Areas include clitoral glans, body, crura. Also shows vestibular bulbs and corpus cavernosa.]]
The clitoral hood is formed from the same tissues that form the foreskin in human males. The clitoral hood is formed during the [[Fetus|fetal]] stage by the cellular lamella.<ref name="Cold and Taylor"/> The cellular lamella grows down on the [[dorsal side]] of the clitoris and is eventually fused with the clitoris. 

The clitoral hood varies in the size, shape, thickness, and other aesthetic areas. Some women have large clitoral hoods that completely cover the clitoral glans. Some of these can be retracted to expose the clitoral glans, such as for hygiene purposes or for pleasure; others do not retract. Other women have smaller hoods that do not cover the full length of the clitoral glans, leaving the clitoral glans exposed all the time. As in the male, sticky bands of tissue called ''adhesions'' can form between the hood and the glans; these stick the hood onto the glans so the hood cannot be pulled back to expose the glans, and, as in the male, strongly scented [[smegma]] can accumulate.

==Stimulation==
Women with hoods covering most of the clitoris can often [[Masturbation|masturbate]] by stimulating the hood over the clitoral glans; those with smaller, or more compact, structures tend to rub the clitoral glans and hood together as one item.<ref name="Carroll">{{cite book | title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2009 | pages = 118 and 252 | accessdate = 23 June 2012 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=The+glans+clitoris#v=onepage&q=The%20glans%20clitoris|isbn =978-0-495-60274-3 | first = Janell L. | last = Carroll| quote=The clitoral glans is a particularly sensitive receptor and transmitter of sexual stimuli. In fact, the clitoris, although much smaller than the penis, has twice the number of nerve endings (8,000) as the penis (4,000) and has a higher concentration of nerve fibers than anywhere else on the body... In fact, most women do not enjoy direct stimulation of the glans and prefer stimulation through the [hood]... The majority of women enjoy a light caressing of the shaft of the clitoris, together with an occasional circling of the [clitoral glans], and maybe digital (finger) penetration of the vagina. Other women dislike direct stimulation and prefer to have the [clitoral glans] rolled between the lips of the labia. Some women like to have the entire area of the vulva caressed, whereas others like the caressing to be focused on the [clitoral glans].}}</ref> Normally, the glans clitoris itself is too sensitive to be stimulated directly, such as in cases where the hood is retracted.<ref name="Carroll"/> 

The clitoral hood also provides protection to the clitoral glans like foreskin on the penile glans.<ref name="Sloane"/> During sexual stimulation, the hood may also prevent the penis from coming into direct contact with the glans clitoris, which is usually stimulated by the pressure of the partners' pubis. Most mammals and primates approach [[copulation]] from the rear instead of the common frontal position that humans often assume, so the clitoral stimulation is directly created by glans contact with the [[scrotum]] at the base of the penis and the different contractions of its corrugated dartos muscles. The [[clitoral glans]], like the foreskin must be lubricated by the naturally provided [[sebum]]. If a woman's clitoral glans is not lubricated the hood may not caress it during sexual stimulation, or the female may experience pain rather than pleasure.

==Modifications==
{{See also|Clitoris#Modification and mutilation}}
In most of the world, clitoral modifications are uncommon. In some cultures, [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is practiced as a rite of passage into womanhood, is perceived as an improvement to the appearance of the genitalia, or is used to suppress or reduce female sexual desire and pleasure.<ref name="Engaging Cultural Differences: The Multicultural Challenge in Liberal Democracies">[http://books.google.com/books?id=DljvifEwf34C&pg=PA216&dq=engaging+cultural+differences+chapter+11&hl=en&ei=n3u8TqDODMHV0QGewY25BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Link text], "Engaging Cultural Differences: The Multicultural Challenge in Liberal Democracies," Chapter 11, Schweder, et al., 2002.</ref><ref name="Momoh">{{cite book |last=Momoh |first=Comfort |author-link=Comfort Momoh|chapter=Female Genital Mutation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&pg=PA5 |title=Female Genital Mutilation |editor-last=Momoh |eitor-first=Comfort|pages=5â€“12 |publisher=Radcliffe Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-85775-693-7|ref = harv}}</ref><ref name="Koroma 1997">{{cite web | url = http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT77/006/1997/en/3ed9f8e9-e984-11dd-8224-a709898295f2/act770061997en.html | title = What is Female Genital Mutilation? | date = 30 September 1997 | work = Amnesty International | page = 2 | accessdate = 25 April 2010 | last = Koroma | first = Hannah}}</ref><ref name="WHO, FGM">{{cite web|title=Female genital mutilation|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)|year=2008/2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html}}</ref> One possible modification that exists for the opposite reason is to have the hood [[Body piercing|pierced]] and insert jewellery, both for adornment and physical pleasure. Though much less common, other women opt to have their own hood surgically trimmed or removed so as to permanently expose part or all of the clitoral head. Such procedures, and FGM in general, were once performed on many children in Western countries such as the United States as well, to discourage masturbation and reduce diseases believed to relate to it, but by the 1960s this practice was recognized{{By whom|date=September 2011}} as abusive and discontinued.
