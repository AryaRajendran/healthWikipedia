==Biography==

Caroline Schweigaard Nicolaysen (known in her childhood as Bitteba) was the youngest of four children born to Vilhelm Bernhoft Nicolaysen, an Army officer, and Anna Horn. She grew up in the section of Oslo known as [[Homansbyen]], apparently an active and curious child, but also unusually sensitive. According to her son [[Helge Waal]], she was prone to [[psychosomatic]] illnesses as a young child; and indeed she completed her first year of [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at home, due to illness. She attended [[Oslo Katedralskole]] starting in the fall of 1921, where her schoolmates included [[Trygve Bull]], [[Karl Evang]], and [[Trygve Braatøy]].<ref name=legeforeningen/>

She attended the [[University of Oslo]], became politically active as a radical socialist, and finished her medical studies in 1930. She was associated with the [[Mot Dag]] movement and worked as an editor in the periodical [[Æsculap]]. The political convictions she developed as a student set the foundation for a lifelong engagement in social causes, especially related to the needs of children, adolescents, and women.<ref name=legeforeningen/>

Plagued with her own emotional problems all her life, she first underwent [[psychoanalysis]] with [[Harald Schjelderup]] in Norway while she was a student. In 1927 she married the writer [[Sigurd Hoel]].<ref>Characterized as a marriage consisting primarily of correspondence, it ended in divorce in 1936, but some of Waal's earlier writings were under the name "Nic Hoel."</ref> She continued her psychoanalysis in [[Berlin]] as a student under [[Salomea Kempner]],<ref>Salomea Kempner was one of the leading psychoanalysts of her time. Apparently she ended her days in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], though details are unknown.</ref> and in 1933 and 1934 she was accepted in the German and Danish-Norwegian Psychoanalytic associations, respectively.<ref name=psyko/> In 1936, Sigurd Hoel and she divorced, and in 1937 she married [[Wessel Waal]] and took the last name Waal for good.<ref name=legeforeningen/>

While in Berlin, Waal became associated with [[Wilhelm Reich]] and accompanied him when he fled Nazi persecution by moving to Norway. She continued her training first under another refugee from the Nazi regime, the [[Austria]]n [[Otto Fenichel]], and then with Reich until 1939, when she opened her own psychoanalytic practice and joined the staff at [[Gaustad sykehus|Gaustad psychiatric hospital]], where she remained on staff until 1947.<ref name=pax/>

During the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] of Norway from 1940 to 1945, Waal became active in the underground resistance to the occupation. Among other activities, she was central in assuring the escape of [[Jewish Children's Home in Oslo|Jewish children from Oslo]], thereby saving them from [[Jewish deportees from Norway during World War II|deportation]] and [[Holocaust in Norway|certain death]].<ref>All children deported with the [[SS Donau (1929)|SS ''Donau'']], which they surely would have been sent with, were immediately sent to the gas chambers at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Birkenau]]</ref> For this effort, she was named among the [[Norwegian Righteous among the Nations]]. She was also active in the Norwegian clandestine intelligence service, [[XU]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Sæter |first= Einar |authorlink=Einar Sæter |coauthors= Sæter, Svein |title= XU - I Hemmeleg Teneste 1940-45 |origyear= 2007 |edition= 3rd (revised) |series= |volume= |date= |year= 2007 |month= |publisher= [[Det Norske Samlaget]] |location= Oslo |language= Norwegian |isbn= 978-82-521-7208-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= page 305 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>
In the spring of 1945, she was briefly arrested and escaped to Sweden. 

Waal resumed her professional activities immediately after the war. She remained on the staff at Gaustad and also at [[Ullevål University Hospital|Ullevål hospital]], but also worked in [[Denmark]], [[United States]], [[Switzerland]], and [[France]], with [[Serge Lebovici]]. She was remembered by [[Cyrille Koupernik]] as "that Norwegian madwoman". In 1951, she was board certified as a psychiatrist, and in 1953, as one of the first in Norway, within pediatric and adolescent psychiatry.<ref name=legeforeningen/>

Soon after her application to be the chief of staff at the newly formed Institute for Pediatric and Adolescent Psychiatry at [[Rikshospitalet]] was turned down (supposedly because her physical presentation was messy) in 1951, she started her own institute, named [[Nic Waals Institutt]]; first in her basement in the suburb [[Husebygrenda]] and eventually to the "blue house" in [[Munkedamsveien]] near [[Skillebekk]].<ref name=legeforeningen/> 

Waal remained professionally active as the director of her institute until her death in 1960, also finding time to help juvenile offenders. She had two children with Wessel Waal, the psychiatrist [[Helge Waal]] (who also became her biographer) and the child psychologist [[Berit Waal Skaslien]]. She divorced Waal and married [[Alex Helju]] in 1951, who died in a boating accident in 1954.<ref name=legeforeningen/><ref>Apparently, she and Waal became close again after Helju died and until her own death in 1960</ref>

==Professional contributions and legacy==

In spite of her personal problems, Nic Waal maintained an active and passionate professional life, integrating advocacy on public health issues, a strong interest in teaching, and clinical discipline into a broad range of issues in her field. She made lasting contributions within the areas of:<ref name=legeforeningen/>

* The practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, usually within the context of Wilhelm Reich's framework but independently of his views. She did pioneering research and clinical work within the field of somatic psychiatric diagnostic techniques.
* Pediatric and adolescent psychiatry as a distinct field in Norwegian mental health
* Human sexuality, particularly among children and adolescents.
* Education - her institute provided educational programs for six distinct professions, including non-medical professionals such as psychologist, social workers, and clinical educators

When interviewed by the [[NRK|Norwegian radio]] shortly before her death, she said: 

{{cquote|Many people think something with their heads and feel something different with their heart. Many close completely off their feelings when they think. This is often called being logical. But the heart also has its logic. It is said that women think with their hearts - as if this was something contemptible .... I am inclined to say that the restless and spontanous heart behind opinions was and is the most important in opinions earlier, now, and in the future.}} 

{{cquote|Svært mange mennesker mener noe med hodet og føler noe annet med hjertet. Mange stenger helt av for hva de føler når de tenker. Det kalles ofte å være logisk. Men hjertet har også sin logikk. Det sies lett at kvinnen tenker med hjertet - som om det var foraktelig. (...) Jeg er tilbøyelig til å si at det urolige og spontane hjertet bak meningene var og er det viktigste i meninger før, nå og i fremtiden.}} <ref name=pax/>

The Nic Waal Institute, though renamed for some time, now continues as a leading regional teaching and clinical institution in Oslo under the auspices of [[Lovisenberg Diakonale Sykhus]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lds.no/modules/module_123/proxy.asp?iDisplayType=2&iCategoryId=234&iInfoId=3094 |title= Nic Waals Institutt |accessdate= 2008-10-03 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= Lovisenberg Diakonale Sykhus |location= Oslo |pages= |language= Norwegian |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>
