A '''female condom''' (also known as a '''femidom''') is a device that is used during [[sexual intercourse]] as a [[barrier contraceptive]] and to reduce the risk of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs—such as [[gonorrhea]], [[syphilis]], and [[HIV]]) and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Invented by Danish [[Medical Doctor|MD]] [[Lasse Hessel]], it is worn internally by the female partner and provides a physical barrier to prevent exposure to ejaculated [[semen]] or other body fluids. Female condoms can be used by the receptive partner during [[anal sex]].<ref>[http://www.aidsmap.com/en/docs/A85BA23D-6F72-4CD2-90A4-D914A60BEF79.asp Female condoms for anal sex ]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acponline.org/acp_press/fenway/how-to-put-on-a-female-condom-for-anal-sex.pdf |title=How to Put on a Female Condom (For Anal Sex) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>

The female condom is a thin, soft, loose-fitting sheath with a flexible ring at each end. They typically come in various sizes. For most vaginas, a moderately sized condom is adequate; women who have recently given birth should try a large first. The inner ring at the closed end of the sheath is used to insert the condom inside the vagina and to hold it in place during intercourse. The rolled outer ring at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vagina and covers part of the external genitalia.

==Versions and materials==
[[Image:ReddyFc.png|thumb|left|Reddy brand female condom.]]

The FC1 female condom was first made from [[polyurethane]]. The second generation female condom is called the FC2 and is made from synthetic nitrile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.femalehealth.com/theproduct.html#compare |title=Product |publisher=Femalehealth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> (this material change was announced in September 2005,<ref name="FHC press">{{cite press release |title=Female Health Company Announces International Availability of Second — Generation Female Condom at Significantly Lower Price |publisher=Female Health Company |date=September 29, 2005 |url=http://www.femalehealth.com/InvestorRelations/investor_pressreleases/press_2005_09_21_2ndGenerationFC_Announcement.pdf  |format=PDF|accessdate=2006-08-03 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}(PDF)</ref> and full transition of the product line to FC2 was done by October 2009 <ref>{{cite web |title=Female Health Company |publisher=Female Health Company |url=http://www.femalehealth.com/ |accessdate=2011-06-12 }}</ref>). The newer nitrile condoms are less likely to make potentially distracting crinkling noises. FC2 was developed to take the place of FC1, providing the same safety and efficacy during use, but at a lower cost. It is hoped the nitrile condoms will also allow for significant reductions in female condom pricing.<ref name="FHC press" /> FC2 is manufactured by The Female Health Company. The [[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]) has cleared FC2 for purchase by [[U.N.]] agencies and the [[UNFPA]] (a U.N. agency) has incorporated the female condom into national programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/hiv/female.htm |title=UNFPA |publisher=UNFPA |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> They are sold under many brand names, including ''Reality, Femidom, Dominique, Femy, Myfemy, Protectiv'' and ''Care''.

A recent version of the female condom is made from natural latex, the same material used in male condoms. This condom does not make the noises some experience with plastic condoms. This type of female condom is manufactured by Medtech Products Ltd, India. It is sold under various brand names, including ''Reddy'', ''V Amour'', ''L'amour'', ''VA WOW Feminine condom'', and ''Sutra''. One more clinical trial is required before it can be considered for FDA approval in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/femcond.htm |title=The Female Condom |publisher=Avert.org |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>

The global health nonprofit [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health]] (PATH) has also developed a female condom tailored for use in [[developing world|developing countries]]. The Woman's Condom is manufactured by [[Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus]] in China and is currently undergoing clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.path.org/projects/womans_condom.php |title=PATH's woman's condom |publisher=Path.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>

==Costs and "reuse" of the original FC and FC2==
The per unit price of female condoms is higher than male condoms but there is some evidence to suggest that polyurethane female condoms can be washed, disinfected, and reused.

Re-using the polyurethane female condom is not considered as safe as using a new one, however the WHO says, "Batches of new, unused female condoms were subjected to seven cycles of disinfection, washing, drying and re-lubrication, reflecting the steps and procedures in the draft protocol, but at considerably higher concentrations of [[bleach]] and for longer durations. All female condom batches met the manufacturing quality assessment specifications for structural integrity after the test cycles. ... Disinfection, washing, drying, re-lubrication and reuse of the device were not associated with penile discharge, symptomatic vaginal irritation or adverse colposcopic findings in study volunteers."<!--

Further microbiological and virological tests are required before re-use of the female condom can be recommended."<!--

Research suggests that the FC2 female condoms are a cost-effective method of HIV prevention even at low levels of use. The data shows that the cost-effectiveness would increase significantly at higher levels of use. A study conducted in 2005 by Dr. David Holtgrave, Chair of the Department of Health, Behavior and Society at [[Johns Hopkins University]]'s [[Bloomberg School of Public Health]], examined the projected public health impact that the FC2 female condom would have at different levels of use in two developing countries: South Africa and Brazil. The study concluded that FC2 use would generate significant cost savings at all levels of implementation by preventing thousands of HIV infections and saving millions of dollars in health care costs.<!--

==Lubrication==
As with all barrier contraceptives, water or [[personal lubricant#Silicone-based|silicone-based lubricants]] are safe to use with any female condom. Oil should not be used with a female condom made of [[latex]].  

FC2 Female Condom comes pre-lubricated with a non-spermicidal, silicone based lubricant. The FC2 is made of nitrile so oil-based (or water-based) lubricants can be added on the inside and outside of FC2 Female Condom or on the penis.

==Advantages==
FC2 Female Condom gives women control and choice over their own sexual health; women can protect themselves when their partner does not want to use a male condom; female condoms may provide enhanced sensation for men as compared to male condoms;<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding The Finer Nuances Of The Female Condom |publisher=Women's Health Line |year=2009 |url=http://www.womenhealthline.com/understanding-the-finer-nuances-of-the-female-condom/ |accessdate=2011-06-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fc Female Condom |publisher=About.com | author=Dawn Stacey, M.Ed, [[LMHC]] |year=2009 |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/overthecounterchoices/gr/fc.htm |accessdate=2011-06-12 }}</ref> FC2 is hypo allergenic and is safe to use with people who are allergic to rubber latex; FC2 may be inserted hours before intercourse; female condoms are not dependent on the penis being erect for insertion and does not require immediate withdrawal after ejaculation; FC2 is not tight or constricting; FC2 is highly lubricated and the material warms to body temperature.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Product |work=FC & FC2 Female Condom |publisher=Female Health Company |year=2005 |url=http://www.femalehealth.com/theproduct.html |accessdate=2006-08-03 }}</ref> 

The external genitals of the wearer and the base of the penis of the inserting partner may be more protected (from skin-to-skin transmitted [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]] such as [[herpes]] and [[HPV]]) than when the male condom is used, however see studies below.

==Worldwide use==
Sales of female condoms have been disappointing in developed countries, though developing countries are increasingly using them to complement already existing family planning and HIV/AIDS programming.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Global Consultation on the Female Condom |publisher=PATH  |date=September 26 to 29, 2005  |location=Baltimore, MD |url=http://www.path.org/projects/womans_condom_gcfc2005.php |accessdate=2006-08-03 }}</ref> Probable causes for poor sales are that inserting the female condom is a skill that has to be learned and that female condoms can be significantly more expensive than male condoms (upwards of 2 or 3 times the cost). Also, reported "rustling" sounds from the original version of the female condom during intercourse turn off some potential users, as does the visibility of the outer ring which remains outside the vagina.<ref name="obos">{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves : A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY  |isbn=0-7432-5611-5}}</ref> 

In November 2005, the World [[YWCA]] called on national health ministries and international donors to commit to purchasing 180 million female condoms for global distribution in 2006, stating that "Female condoms remain the only tool for HIV prevention that women can initiate and control," but that they remain virtually inaccessible to women in the developing world due to their high cost of 72¢ per piece. If 180 million female condoms were ordered, the price of a single female condom was projected to decline to 22¢.<ref name="YWCA" />

In 2005, 12 million female condoms were distributed to women in the developing world. By comparison, between 6 and 9 billion male condoms were distributed that year.<ref name="YWCA">{{cite press release |title=Statement of Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, General Secretary, World YWCA |publisher=PRNewswire |date=November 21, 2005 |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=158769= |accessdate=2006-08-03 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>
