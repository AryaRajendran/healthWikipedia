'''Protamines''' are small, [[arginine]]-rich, [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[proteins]] that replace [[histones]] late in the [[haploid]] phase of [[spermatogenesis]] and are believed essential for [[sperm]] head condensation and [[DNA]] stabilization. They may allow for denser packaging of DNA in [[spermatozoon]] than histones, but they must be decompressed before the genetic data can be used for protein synthesis. However, in humans and maybe other primates, 10-15% of the sperm's genome is packaged by histones thought to bind genes that are essential for early embryonic development.<ref name="pmid17903313">{{cite journal | author = Balhorn R | title = The protamine family of sperm nuclear proteins | journal = Genome Biol | year = 2007 | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 227 | pmid = 17903313 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-227 | pmc = 2375014 }} </ref>

==Medical uses==
When mixed with [[insulin]], protamines slow down the onset and increase the duration of insulin action (see [[NPH insulin]]).<ref name="pmid21668337">{{cite journal | author = Owens DR | title = Insulin preparations with prolonged effect | journal = Diabetes Technol.

Protamine is used in [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] surgery to neutralize the anti-clotting effects of heparin. Adverse effects include increased pulmonary artery pressure and decrease peripheral blood pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, cardiac output, and heart rate.<ref name="pmid10596998">{{cite journal | author = Carr JA, Silverman N | title = The heparin-protamine interaction.

==Examples==
Mice, humans, and certain fish have two or more different protamines, whereas the sperm of bull, boar, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, and ram have one form of protamine. 

===Human===
The 2 human protamines are denoted {{Gene|PRM1}} and {{Gene|PRM2}}.

===Fish===
Examples of protamines from fish are:
*salmine from [[salmon]]
*clupeine from [[herring]] sperm (''Clupea'')
*iridine from [[rainbow trout]]
*thinnine from [[tunafish]] (''Thunnus'')
*stelline from starry sturgeon (''[[Sturgeon|Acipenser stellatus]]'')
*scylliorhinine from [[Squaliformes|dogfish]] (''Scylliorhinus'')
