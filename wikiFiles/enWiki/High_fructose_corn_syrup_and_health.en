The consumption of [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS or [[glucose]]–[[fructose]] syrup) and its relationship to a [[healthy diet]] is a subject of investigation. Evidence does not indicate it is less healthy than sugar consumption in general. Concerns mainly center around excessive sugar intake and its contribution to [[obesity]]. 

==Background==
The term ''[[high-fructose corn syrup]]'' was developed to distinguish it from all-glucose corn syrups that existed in the past, and does not accurately describe the composition of the syrup (which is composed of a mixture of 42-55% fructose, 41-45% glucose and 0-5% glucose polymers depending on the specific blend).<ref name = Rizkalla/> In the 1980s it replaced [[sucrose]] as the main sweetener of [[soft drink]]s in the United States.  Sucrose is a [[disaccharide]] that when consumed, is [[Hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] into 50% glucose and 50% fructose.  Rates of [[obesity]] subsequently rose, paralleling an increase in the consumption of soft drinks in general, but have not been linked to the usage of HFCS.  Additional concerns have been raised due to laboratory research suggested a link between consuming large amounts of fructose and changes to various proxy health measures including elevated blood [[triglyceride]]s, size and type of [[low-density lipoprotein]]s and [[uric acid]] levels.<ref name = Rizkalla>{{cite pmid | 21050460 }}</ref>

==United States guidelines regarding sugar consumption==
Numerous agencies in the United States recommend reducing the consumption of all sugars, including HFCS, without singling it out as presenting extra concerns.  The [[Mayo Clinic]] cites the [[American Heart Association]]'s recommendation that women limit the added sugar in their diet to 100 calories a day (~6 teaspoons) and that men limit it to 150 calories a day (~9 teaspoons), noting that there is not enough evidence to support HFCS having more adverse health effects than excess consumption of any other type of sugar.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-fructose-corn-syrup/AN01588 | title = High-fructose corn syrup: What are the health concerns? | publisher = [[Mayo Clinic]] | accessdate = 2012-10-17 | date = 2012-09-27 }}</ref>  The United States departments of [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] recommendations for a healthy diet state that consumption of all types of added sugars be reduced.<ref name="USDA">{{Cite book | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] | title = Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010. 7th Edition| accessdate = 2012-10-17 | date = December, 2010 | url = http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref>{{rp|p.27}}

==Obesity and metabolic syndrome==
A 2004 commentary in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggested that the altered [[metabolism]] of [[fructose]] when compared to [[glucose]] may be a factor in increasing obesity rates since, as compared to [[glucose]], fructose may be more readily [[lipogenesis|converted to fat]] and the sugar causes less of a rise in [[insulin]] and [[leptin]], both of which increase feelings of [[satiety]].  The authors suggested reducing intake of sugars by using [[sugar substitute]]s instead.<ref name = Bray>{{Cite journal| last = Bray | first = GA | coauthors = Nielsen SJ; Popkin BM | title = Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–543 |  url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/4/537 | pmid = 15051594 | year = 2004 }}</ref>  In subsequent interviews, two of the study's authors stated the article was distorted to place emphasis solely on HFCS when the actual issue was the overconsumption of any type of sugar.<ref name = NYTblog>{{Cite news | url=

Consumption of moderate amounts of fructose has also been linked to positive outcomes, including reducing appetite if consumed before a meal, lower blood sugar increases compared to glucose, and (again compared to glucose) delaying exhaustion if consumed during exercise.<ref name = Rizkalla/>

In 2007 an expert panel assembled by the [[University of Maryland]]'s Center for Food, Nutrition and Agriculture Policy reviewed the links between HFCS and obesity and concluded there was no [[ecological validity]] in the association between rising [[body mass index]]es (a measure of obesity) and the consumption of HFCS.  The panel stated that since the ratio of fructose to glucose had not changed substantially in the United States since the 1960s when HFCS was introduced, the changes in obesity rates were probably not due to HFCS specifically but rather a greater consumption of calories overall, and recommended further research on the topic.<ref name="Forshee">{{Cite journal|title=A critical examination of the evidence relating high-fructose corn syrup and weight gain |author=Forshee RA |journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|year=2007|volume=47|pages=561–82 |doi=10.1080/10408390600846457 |pmid=17653981 |url=http://www.sweetsurprise.com/sites/default/files/CriticalReviewsinFSandN47-6-561-582.pdf|format=pdf | last2 = Storey | first2 = ML | last3 = et al. | issue = 6}}</ref>  In 2009 the [[American Medical Association]] published a [[review article]] on HFCS and concluded that based on the science available at the time it appeared unlikely that HFCS contributed more to obesity or other health conditions than sucrose, and there was insufficient evidence to suggest warning about or restricting use of HFCS or other fructose-containing sweeteners in foods. The review did report that studies found direct associations between high intakes of fructose and adverse health outcomes, including obesity and the metabolic syndrome.<ref name="pmid20516261">{{cite pmid | 20516261}} "Because the composition of HFCS and sucrose is so similar, particularly on absorption by the body, it appears unlikely that HFCS contributes more to obesity or other conditions than sucrose does. ... few studies have evaluated the potentially differential effect of various sweeteners."</ref>  Other authors have disagreed, suggesting a link between HFCS and [[metabolic syndrome]] that is independent of obesity.<ref name = Ferder>{{cite pmid | 20424937}} "Experimental HFCS consumption seems to produce some of the changes associated with metabolic syndrome even without increasing the body weight. Metabolic damage associated with HFCS probably is not limited to obesity-pathway mechanisms."</ref>

===Studies===
Part of the concern over fructose arises from [[animal testing]] in which the injection of fructose directly into the brain of [[rat]]s led to increased eating and subsequent research in [[mice]] seemed to confirm this effect.  Re-examination of the results suggested that the results in rodents would have little meaning in humans due to the dosage given (equivalent to a 75 kg human consuming 660 grams of fructose, whereas a normal daily intake is approximately 50 grams) and the strict control over the amount of fructose that crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name = Rizkalla/>  Subsequent testing with humans using both short- and long-term experiments found no important differences between the consumption of HFCS versus other sugars.<ref name = Rizkalla/>  Most of the studies linking fructose consumption to higher blood [[triglyceride]]s have been in rodents through mechanisms different from those in humans, and therefore it is unlikely that high-fructose diets would have comparable effects in humans.  Tests in humans suggest that for people with [[insulin resistance]], diets with 50 grams or more per day (high consumption) may result in elevated triglycerides, but there is no effect with normal levels of fructose consumption.<ref name = Rizkalla/>

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiological research]] has suggested that the increase in obesity is linked to increased consumption of sugars and/or calories in general, and not due to any special effect of fructose alone.<ref name = Rizkalla/>

==Other issues==
Consumption of HFCS has been associated with [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]], as it is thought that fructose may cause increased [[adipose tissue|fat deposits]] in the [[abdomen]]<ref name = Nseir>{{cite pmid | 20518077 }}</ref> though it has also been suggested that this association is not unique to fructose and may be due to glucose consumption as well.<ref name = Allocca>{{cite book | first = M | last = Allocca | coauthors = Selmi C | year = 2010 | chapter = Emerging nutritional treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease | title = Nutrition, diet therapy, and the liver | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ahWoeI4-Y34C&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q&f=false 131–146] | isbn = 1-4200-8549-2 | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | editors = Preedy VR; Lakshman R; Rajaskanthan RS }}</ref>  

The presence of [[carbonyl]] compounds found in HFCS-containing beverages has been suggested as a contributor to poor health and problems for people with [[diabetes]], though this concern is unfounded as HFCS is of no more concern than other sources and the compounds are produced [[endogeny|endogenously]] by the body.<ref name = White>{{cite pmid | 19386820}}</ref>

High fructose consumption has been linked to high levels of [[uric acid]] in the blood, though this is only thought to be a concern for patients with [[gout]].<ref name = Rizkalla/>

The possibility that significant consumption of products containing high fructose corn syrup with detectable levels of mercury could result in neurotoxicity was raised by studies in 2009.<ref name=Dufault>{{cite journal |author=Dufault R, Schnoll R, Lukiw WJ, Leblanc B, Cornett C, Patrick L, Wallinga D, Gilbert SG, Crider R |title=Mercury exposure, nutritional deficiencies and metabolic disruptions may affect learning in children |journal=Behav Brain Funct |volume=5 |issue= |pages=44 |date=2009 Oct 27 |pmid=19860886 |pmc=2773803 |doi=10.1186/1744-9081-5-44}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Wallinga D, Sorensen J, Mottl P, Yablon B |url=http://www.iatp.org/files/421_2_105026.pdf  |title=Not So Sweet: Missing Mercury and High Fructose Corn Syrup |publisher=Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy |date=January 2009 |accessdate=2012-09-20 }} (self-published)</ref><ref name=VueWeekly>{{cite web |author=Connie Howard |url=http://vueweekly.com/front/story/well_well_well_mercury_confusion |title=Mercury confusion: What's being done about mercury in our food? |publisher=VueWeekly.com |date=February 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-08 }}</ref> In 2011 the Corn Refiners Association announced that “no mercury or mercury-based technology is used in the production of high fructose corn syrup in North America.”<ref>http://www.sweetsurprise.com/2011/06/08/5-reasonshighfructosecornsyrupwillkillyou</ref> By the end of 2012, most chlor-alkali plants in the United States had phased out older "mercury cell" technology linked to mercury contamination of HFCS, except for two chlor-alkali plants - one in Ohio and one in West Virginia, run by ASHTA Chemicals and PPG Industries, respectively.<ref name=AugustaChronical>{{cite web |author=Rob Pavey |url=http://www.chronical.augusta.com/news/business/local-business/2012-07-15/olin-prepares-mercury-free-future-after-47-years |title=Olin prepares for mercury free future after 47 years |publisher=Augusta Chronical |date=July 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-08 }}</ref><ref name=ECCLetter>{{cite web |author=Bradley J.
