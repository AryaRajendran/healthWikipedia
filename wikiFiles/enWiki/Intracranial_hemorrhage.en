An '''intracranial hemorrhage''' (ICH) is a [[hemorrhage]], or bleeding, within the [[Human skull|skull]].

==Causes==
Intracranial bleeding occurs when a [[blood vessel]] within the skull is ruptured or leaks.  It can result from [[physical trauma]] (as occurs in [[head injury]]) or nontraumatic causes (as occurs in [[hemorrhagic stroke]]) such as a ruptured [[aneurysm]].  [[Anticoagulant]] therapy, as well as [[coagulopathy|disorders with blood clotting]] can heighten the risk that an intracranial hemorrhage will occur.<ref name="Kushner98">

==Prognosis==
Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious [[medical emergency]] because the buildup of blood within the skull can lead to increases in [[intracranial pressure]], which can crush delicate brain tissue or limit its blood supply.  Severe increases in intracranial pressure can cause potentially deadly [[brain herniation]], in which parts of the brain are squeezed past structures in the skull.

==Diagnosis==
CT scan ([[computed tomography]]) is the definitive tool for accurate diagnosis of an intracranial hemorrhage.

==Classification==
Types of intracranial hemorrhage are roughly grouped into intra-axial and extra-axial.  The hemorrhage is considered a [[focal and diffuse brain injury|focal brain injury]]; that is, it occurs in a localized spot rather than causing diffuse damage over a wider area.

===Intra-axial hemorrhage===
{{Main|cerebral hemorrhage}}
Intra-axial hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain itself, or [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. This category includes [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage]], or bleeding within the brain tissue, and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]], bleeding within the brain's [[ventricular system|ventricle]]s (particularly of [[Premature birth|premature infants]]). Intra-axial hemorrhages are more dangerous and harder to treat than extra-axial bleeds.<ref name="Brant07">{{cite book |author= Seidenwurm DI |editor=Brant WE, Helms CA |chapter=Introduction to brain imaging |title=Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology |publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages= 53 |isbn=0-7817-6135-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-11-17 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Sossht2t5XwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=extra-axial+intra-axial}}</ref>

===Extra-axial hemorrhage===
Extra-axial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs within the skull but outside of the brain tissue, falls into three subtypes:
*[[Epidural hemorrhage]] (extradural hemorrhage)  which occur between the [[dura mater]] (the outermost [[meninx]]) and the skull, is caused by trauma.  It may result from laceration of an artery, most commonly the [[middle meningeal artery]]. This is a very dangerous type of injury because the bleed is from a high-pressure system and deadly increases in [[intracranial pressure]] can result rapidly. However, it is the least common type of meningeal bleeding and is seen in 1% to 3% cases of head injury .
**Patients have a loss of consciousness (LOC), then a [[lucid interval]], then sudden deterioration (vomiting, restlessness, LOC)
**Head CT shows lenticular (convex) deformity.
*[[Subdural hemorrhage]] results from tearing of the bridging veins in the [[subdural space]] between the [[dura mater|dura]] and [[arachnoid mater]].
**Head CT shows crescent-shaped deformity
*[[Subarachnoid hemorrhage]], which occur between the arachnoid and [[pia mater|pia]] meningeal layers, like intraparenchymal hemorrhage, can result either from trauma or from ruptures of [[aneurysm]]s or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.  Blood is seen layering into the brain along [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] and [[fissure]]s, or filling [[Cistern (neuroanatomy)|cistern]]s (most often the [[suprasellar cistern]] because of the presence of the [[blood vessel|vessel]]s of the [[circle of Willis]] and their branchpoints within that space). The classic presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage is the sudden onset of a severe headache (a [[thunderclap headache]]). This can be a very dangerous entity, and requires emergent neurosurgical evaluation, and sometimes urgent intervention.

==== Epidural hematoma ====
{{main|Epidural hematoma}}
{{Epidural vs. subdural hematoma}}
Epidural hematoma (EDH) is a rapidly accumulating hematoma between the [[dura mater]] and the cranium. These patients have a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness, then a lucid period, followed by loss of consciousness. Clinical onset occurs over minutes to hours. Many of these injuries are associated with lacerations of the [[middle meningeal artery]]. A "lenticular", or convex, lens-shaped extracerebral hemorrhage that does not cross suture lines will likely be visible on a [[CT scan]] of the head. Although death is a potential complication, the prognosis is good when this injury is recognized and treated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==== Subdural hematoma ====
{{main|Subdural hematoma}}
Subdural hematoma occurs when there is tearing of the bridging vein between the cerebral cortex and a draining venous sinus. At times they may be caused by arterial lacerations on the brain surface. Acute subdural hematomas are usually associated with cerebral cortex injury as well and hence the prognosis is not as good as extra dural hematomas. Clinical features depend on the site of injury and severity of injury. Patients may have a history of loss of consciousness but they recover and do not relapse. Clinical onset occurs over hours. A crescent shaped hemorrhage compressing the brain that does cross suture lines will be noted on CT of the head. Craniotomy and surgical evacuation is required if there is significant pressure effect on the brain.Complications include focal neurologic deficits depending on the site of hematoma and brain injury, increased intra cranial pressure leading to herniation of brain and ischemia due to reduced blood supply and seizures.

====Subarachnoid hemorrhage====
{{Main|Subarachnoid hemorrhage}}
A ''subarachnoid hemorrhage'' is [[bleeding]] into the [[subarachnoid space]]—the area between the [[arachnoid (brain)|arachnoid membrane]] and the [[pia mater]] surrounding the [[brain]]. Besides from head injury, it may occur spontaneously, usually from a ruptured [[cerebral aneurysm]]. [[Symptom]]s of SAH include a severe [[headache]] with a rapid onset ("[[thunderclap headache]]"), [[vomiting]], confusion or a lowered [[level of consciousness]], and sometimes [[seizure]]s.<ref name=vanGijn>{{cite journal |author=van Gijn J, Kerr RS, Rinkel GJ |title=Subarachnoid haemorrhage |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9558 |pages=306–18 |year=2007 |pmid=17258671 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60153-6}}</ref> The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is generally confirmed with a [[computed tomography|CT scan]] of the head, or occasionally by [[lumbar puncture]].  Treatment is by prompt [[neurosurgery]] or [[interventional radiology|radiologically guided interventions]] with medications and other treatments to help prevent recurrence of the bleeding and complications. Since the 1990s, many aneurysms are treated by a minimal invasive procedure called "[[Guglielmi Detachable Coil|coiling]]", which is carried out by instrumentation through large blood vessels. However, this procedure has higher recurrence rates than the more invasive craniotomy with clipping.<ref name=vanGijn/>
