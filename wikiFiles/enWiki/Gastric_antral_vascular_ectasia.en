==Signs and symptoms==
Most patients who are eventually diagnosed with watermelon stomach come to a physician complaining of [[anemia]] and blood loss.<ref name=Argon /> Sometimes, a patient may come to the medical doctor because he or she notices blood in the stools — either [[melena]] (black and tarry stools) and/or [[hematochezia]] (maroon stools).<ref name=Argon />

==Differential diagnosis==
GAVE results in intestinal bleeding similar to [[duodenal ulcer]]s and [[portal hypertension]].<ref name=rare /><ref name=Cause /><ref name=Unusual /> The GI bleeding can result in [[anemia]],<ref name=Unusual /><ref name=Argon /> as well as occult blood in the stool.<ref name=rare /> It is often overlooked, but can be more common in elderly patients.<ref name=rare /><ref name=Cause /><ref name=Argon /> It has been seen in patients as young as 38 years of age.<ref name=Unusual />

Watermelon stomach has a different etiology and has a [[differential diagnosis]] from portal hypertension.<ref name=Unusual /><ref name=Portal>{{cite journal |last1=Spahr |first1=L |last2=Villeneuve |first2=J-P |last3=Dufresne |first3=M-P |last4=Tasse |first4=D |last5=Bui |first5=B |last6=Willems |first6=B |last7=Fenyves |first7=D |last8=Pomier-Layrargues |first8=G |title=Gastric antral vascular ectasia in cirrhotic patients: absence of relation with portal hypertension |journal=Gut |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=739 |year=1999 |pmid=10205216 |pmc=1727493 |doi=10.1136/gut.44.5.739}}</ref> In fact, cirrhosis and portal hypertension may be missing in a patient with GAVE.<ref name=Unusual />  The differential diagnosis is important because treatments are different.<ref name=rare /><ref name=Cause /><ref name=Unusual /><ref name=Argon /><ref name=ablation />

==Diagnosis==

GAVE is usually diagnosed definitively by means of an [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] biopsy.<ref name=Unusual /><ref name=Argon /><ref name=ablation /><ref name=Diagnosis>{{cite journal |last1=Gilliam |first1=John H. |last2=Geisinger |first2=Kim R. |last3=Wu |first3=Wallace C. |last4=Weidner |first4=Noel |last5=Richter |first5=Joel E. |title=Endoscopic biopsy is diagnostic in gastric antral vascular ectasia |journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=885 |year=1989 |pmid=2721320 |doi=10.1007/BF01540274}}</ref> The tell-tale watermelon stripes show up during the endoscopy.<ref name=Argon />

Surgical exploration of the [[abdomen]] may be needed to diagnose some cases, especially if the liver or other organs are involved.<ref name=Chronic />

===Pathologic features===
GAVE is characterized by dilated capillaries in the [[lamina propria]] with [[fibrin]] [[thrombi]].  The main [[histomorphology|histomorphologic]] differential diagnosis is [[portal hypertension]], which is often apparent from clinical findings.

Research in 2010 has shown that anti-[[RNA polymerase]] III antibodies may be used as a [[risk marker]] for GAVE in [[systemic sclerosis]] patients.<ref name=risk>{{cite journal |last1=Ceribelli |first1=A |last2=Cavazzana |first2=I |last3=Airò |first3=P |last4=Franceschini |first4=F |title=Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies as a risk marker for early gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) in systemic sclerosis |journal=The Journal of rheumatology |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1544 |year=2010 |pmid=20595295 |doi=10.3899/jrheum.100124}}</ref>

==Incidence==
The average age of diagnosis for GAVE is 73 years of age for females,<ref name=Cause /><ref name=Argon>{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=G |last2=Enns |first2=R |title=Argon photocoagulation in the treatment of gastric antral vascular ectasia and radiation proctitis |journal=Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=801–4 |year=2009 |pmid=20011731 |pmc=2805515}}</ref> and 68 for males.<ref name=Antrectomy /> Women are about twice as often diagnosed with gastric antral vascular ectasia than men.<ref name=Antrectomy /><ref name=Argon /> 71% of all cases of GAVE are diagnosed in females.<ref name=Cause /><ref name=Argon /> Patients in their thirties have been found to have GAVE.<ref name=Unusual /> It becomes more common in women in their eighties, rising to 4% of all such gastrointestinal conditions.<ref name=ablation />

5.7% of all sclerosis patients (and 25% of those who had a certain anti-RNA marker) have GAVE.<ref name=risk />

==Etiology or pathogenesis==
The literature, from 1953 through 2010, often cited that the etiology or pathogenesis of watermelon disease are unknown.<ref name=Chronic /><ref name=Unusual /><ref name=Argon />

Gender has some relationship to the etiology.  65% of patients with both cirrhosis and GAVE are male, but a total of 30% have both conditions.<ref name=rare /> The causal connection between cirrhosis and GAVE has not been proven.<ref name=Unusual />

A [[connective tissue]] disease has been suspected in some cases.<ref name=Argon />

Autoimmunity may have something to do with it,<ref name=RNA>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/24.7.1220 |last1=Valdez |first1=BC |last2=Henning |first2=D |last3=Busch |first3=RK |last4=Woods |first4=K |last5=Flores-Rozas |first5=H |last6=Hurwitz |first6=J |last7=Perlaky |first7=L |last8=Busch |first8=H |title=A nucleolar RNA helicase recognized by autoimmune antibodies from a patient with watermelon stomach disease |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=1220–4 |year=1996 |pmid=8614622 |pmc=145780}}</ref> as 25% of all sclerosis patients who had a certain anti-RNA marker have GAVE.<ref name=risk /> RNA autoimmunity has been suspected as a cause or marker since at least 1996.<ref name=RNA />

One theory current since the 1990s focuses on a history of [[prolapse]] of the stomach into the [[small intestine]].<ref name=rare /><ref name=Chronic />

[[Gastrin]] levels may indicate a hormonal connection.<ref name=Unusual /> This may be due to a "vasoactive intestinal peptide and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine…".<ref name=rare />

It is also possible that infection by ''[[H. pylori]]'' can cause it.{{cite}}

==Associated conditions==
[[Image:Cirrhosis high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing liver [[cirrhosis]], a condition that often precedes hepatic encephalopathy. [[Trichrome stain]].]]
GAVE is associated with a number of conditions, including [[portal hypertension]], [[chronic renal failure]], and [[collagen vascular disease]]s.<ref name=Antrectomy /><ref name=ablation />

==Treatment and prognosis==
Treatments for GAVE have proliferated in recent years.

===Traditional treatments===
GAVE is treated commonly by means of an endoscope, including [[argon plasma coagulation]] and electrocautery.<ref name=Unusual /><ref name=Argon /><ref name=relapse /> Since endoscopy with argon photocoagulation is "usually effective", surgery is "usually not required."<ref name=Argon /> Coagulation therapy is well-tolerated but "tends to induce oozing and bleeding."<ref name=Argon /> "Endoscopy with thermal ablation" is favored [[medical treatment]] because of its low side effects and low mortality, but is "rarely curative."<ref name=Unusual />

===Other treatments===
Other medical treatments have been tried and include [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] therapy,<ref name=relapse /> and anti-fibrinolytic drugs such as [[tranexamic acid]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Corticostreoids are effective, but are "limited by their [[side effects]]."<ref name=Argon />

===Treatment of co-morbid conditions===
A [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]] (TIPS or TIPSS) procedure is used to treat portal hypertension when that is present as an associated condition.  Unfortunately, the TIPSS, which has been used for similar conditions, may cause or exacerbate [[hepatic encephalopathy]].<ref name=Khan>{{cite journal |author=Khan S, Tudur Smith C, Williamson P, Sutton R |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD000553 |year=2006 |pmid=17054131 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000553.pub2 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000553/frame.html |chapter=Portosystemic shunts versus endoscopic therapy for variceal rebleeding in patients with cirrhosis |editor1-last=Khan |editor1-first=Saboor A}}</ref><ref name=Saab>{{cite journal |author=Saab S, Nieto JM, Lewis SK, Runyon BA |title=TIPSS versus paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD004889 |year=2006 |pmid=17054221 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004889.pub2 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004889/frame.html |chapter=TIPS versus paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites |editor1-last=Saab |editor1-first=Sammy}}</ref> TIPSS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex, and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol.<ref name=Sundaram>{{cite journal |author=Sundaram V, Shaikh OS |title=Hepatic encephalopathy: pathophysiology and emerging therapies |journal=Med.

If there is cirrhosis of the liver that has progressed to [[liver failure]], then [[lactulose]] may be prescribed for hepatic encephalopathy, especially for ''[[Hepatic_encephalopathy#Types|Type C encephalopathy]]'' with [[diabetes]].<ref name=Sundaram />  Also, "antibiotics such as [[neomycin]], [[metronidazole]], and [[rifaximin]]" may be used effectively to treat the encephalopathy by removing nitrogen-producing bacteria from the gut.<ref name=Sundaram />

[[Paracentesis]], a medical procedure involving needle drainage of fluid from a [[body cavity]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000078067|paracentesis}}</ref> may be used to remove fluid from the [[peritoneal cavity]] in the [[abdomen]] for such cases.<ref name=Saab />  This procedure uses a large needle, similar to the better-known [[amniocentesis]].

===Surgery===
