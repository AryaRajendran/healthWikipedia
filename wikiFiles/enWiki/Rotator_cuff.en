In [[human anatomy|anatomy]], the '''rotator cuff''' (sometimes incorrectly called a "rotator cup", "rotor cuff", or '''rotary cup'''<ref>[[Tnation]] article [http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/pushups_face_pulls_and_shrugs Push-Ups, Face Pulls, and Shrugs ...for Strong and Healthy Shoulders!] by [[Bill Hartman]] and [[Mike Robertson]]:  The rotator cuff, of course. (Or for those of you from [[Indiana]], that would be your "rotary cup").</ref>) is a group of [[muscle]]s and their [[tendon]]s that act to stabilize the [[shoulder]].  The four muscles of the rotator cuff are over half of the seven [[scapulohumeral muscles]].

==Function==
The rotator cuff muscles are important in shoulder movements and in maintaining [[glenohumeral joint]] (shoulder joint) stability.<ref name=Morag2006>{{cite journal |author=Morag Y, Jacobson JA, Miller B, De Maeseneer M, Girish G, Jamadar D |title=MR imaging of rotator cuff injury: what the clinician needs to know |journal=Radiographics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=1045–65 |year=2006 |pmid=16844931 |doi=10.1148/rg.264055087}}</ref> These muscles arise from the [[scapula]] and connect to the head of the [[humerus]], forming a cuff at the shoulder joint. They hold the '''head of the humerus''' in the small and shallow [[glenoid fossa]] of the scapula. The glenohumeral joint has been analogously described as a [[golf ball]] (head of the humerus) sitting on a golf tee (glenoid fossa).<ref>{{cite web |url =  http://www.amjorthopedics.com/pdfs/038070329.pdf | title =Khazzam et al.  ''American Journal of Orthopedics - Open Shoulder Stabilization Using bone block technique for treatment of chronic glenohumeral instability associated with glenoid deficiency.'' | publisher = American Journal of Orthopedics|date = July, 2009}}</ref>

During abduction of the arm, moving it outward and away from the trunk, the rotator cuff compresses the glenohumeral joint, a term known as concavity compression, in order to allow the large [[deltoid muscle]] to further elevate the arm.  In other words, without the rotator cuff, the humeral head would ride up partially out of the glenoid fossa, lessening the efficiency of the deltoid muscle.  The anterior and posterior directions of the glenoid fossa are more susceptible to shear force perturbations as the glenoid fossa is not as deep relative to the superior and inferior directions.  The rotator cuff's contributions to concavity compression and stability vary according to their stiffness and the direction of the force they apply upon the joint.

==Muscles comprising rotator cuff==
{| class="wikitable"
| '''Muscle''' || '''Origin on scapula''' || '''Attachment on humerus''' || '''Function''' || '''Innervation'''
 |-
 | ''[[Supraspinatus muscle]]''  || [[supraspinous fossa]] || superior and middle facet of the [[greater tubercle|greater tuberosity]] || [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abducts]] the [[arm]] || Suprascapular nerve (C5)

|-
|}

The supraspinatus muscle fans out in a horizontal band to insert on the superior and middle facets of the [[greater tubercle]].  The greater tubercle projects as  the  most [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] structure of the humeral head. Medial to this, in turn, is the lesser tuberosity of the humeral head. The subscapularis muscle origin is divided from the remainder of the rotator cuff origins as it is deep to the [[scapula]].

==Injuries==

===Rotator cuff tear===
{{Main|Rotator cuff tear}}
The tendons at the ends of the rotator cuff muscles can become [[Rotator cuff tear|torn]], leading to [[pain]] and restricted movement of the arm.  A [[Rotator cuff tear|torn rotator cuff]] can occur following a trauma to the shoulder or it can occur through the "wear and tear" on tendons, most commonly the supraspinatus  tendon found under the [[acromion]]. 

Rotator cuff injuries are commonly associated with motions that require repeated overhead motions or forceful pulling motions. Such injuries are frequently sustained by athletes whose actions include making repetitive throws, athletes such as [[cheerleaders]], [[baseball]] [[pitcher]]s, [[softball]] [[pitchers]], [[American football]] players (especially [[quarterback]]s), weightlifters, especially [[powerlifters]] due to extreme weights used in the [[bench press]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] players, [[volleyball]] players (due to their swinging motions){{citation needed|date=June 2012}}, [[water polo]] players, rodeo [[team roping|team ropers]], [[shot put]] throwers (due to using poor technique){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, [[swimmers]], [[boxer]]s, [[kayaker]]s, western [[martial arts|martial artists]], [[Fast bowling|fast bowlers]] in cricket, [[tennis]] players (due to their service motion){{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and [[Tenpin Bowling|tenpin bowlers]] due to the repetitive swinging motion of the arm with the weight of a [[bowling ball]]. 

This type of injury also commonly affects [[orchestra conductor]]s, [[choral conductor]]s, and [[drummer]]s (due, again,  to swinging motions).

===Rotator cuff impingement===
{{Main|Impingement syndrome}}
A [[systematic review]] of relevant research found that the accuracy of the physical examination is low.<ref name="pmid17720798">{{cite journal |author=Hegedus EJ, Goode A, Campbell S, ''et al.'' |title=Physical examination tests of the shoulder: a systematic review with meta-analysis of individual tests |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=80–92 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=17720798 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2007.038406}}</ref> The Hawkins-Kennedy test<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/education/article.asp?article=580 |author=ShoulderDoc.co.uk Shoulder and Elbow Surgery | title=Hawkins-Kennedy Test|accessdate=2007-09-12 |format= |work=}} (video)</ref><ref name="Brukner14">{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicalsportsmedicine.com/chapters/14d.htm |title=Chapter 14: Shoulder Pain |accessdate=2007-08-30 |work=|author=Brukner P, Khan K, Kibler WB}}</ref> has a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of approximately 80% to 90% for detecting impingement.

===Treatment===

====Reduce pain and swelling====
As with all muscle injuries, [[RICE (medicine)|R.I.C.E.]] is an initial response to injury recommended by health providers:
*'''''R'''est'' means ceasing movement of the affected area.
*'''''I'''cing'' uses ice to reduce inflammation.
*'''''C'''ompression'' limits the swelling.
*'''''E'''levation'' involves placing the area higher to reduce inflammation and swelling.

[[Cold compression therapy]] shoulder wraps facilitate the icing and compression of an otherwise difficult body area to ice and compress.

Depending on severity of symptoms, further imaging with radiograph, or MRI may be warranted to see if surgery or an underlying bone injury exists.

====Posture and sleeping positions====
Postures and sleeping positions may be modified to provide relief. But as your shoulder begins to heal, sleeping positions may vary considerably.<ref name="Chapter_40_Rotator_Cusp_Repair">

====Strengthening====
The rotator cuff can be strengthened to rehabilitate shoulder injuries, and prevent future ones. There are different exercises to target the individual rotator cuff muscles.

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Description''' || '''Beginning ''' || '''End'''
 |-
 | The most effective is the side-lying external rotation, which activates the supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus and teres minor.

Lie on a bench sideways, with the affected arm next to the side and flexed about 90 degrees at the elbow. Rotate the upper arm outward, keeping the elbow flexed and the arm close to the body, until the lower arm is perpendicular to the ceiling (see picture). For added resistance, use a dumbbell. Pace at two seconds out and four seconds back.

This is an excellent all-around shoulder exercise.
|| [[Image:side-lying abduction begin.jpg|150px]]
|| [[Image:side-lying abduction end.jpg|150px]]
 |-
 | The propped external rotator targets the infraspinatus and teres minor.

Sit perpendicular to the [[dumbell]] with arm flexed at 90 degrees at the elbow, and the forearm resting parallel on the dumbell. Raise the dumbbell up until the forearm points up. Slowly lower the dumbbell and repeat, exercising both arms.

The [[posterior deltoid]] also aids in external rotation. Like the posterior deltoid, both the infraspinatus and teres minor also contribute to transverse extension of the shoulder, such as during a [[bent over row]] to the chest. They can be trained in this way besides isolating the external rotation action.
|| [[Image:Propped external rotator begin.jpg|150px]]
|| [[Image:Propped external rotator end1.jpg|150px]]
 |-
 | The lateral raise with internal rotation (LRIR) primarily targets the supraspinatus.

Grasping a dumbbell in each hand, internally rotate the arms so that the thumbs point towards the floor when extended (as if emptying a drink into a bin). Raise the arms sideways, keeping the thumbs pointing downwards, until the dumbbells are just below the shoulders.

This exercise is sometimes called a lateral raise.
|| [[Image:LRIR begin.jpg|150px]] || [[Image:LRIR end.jpg|150px]]
|}

Strengthening the rotator cuff allows for increased loads in a variety of exercises. When [[Powerlifting|weightlifters]] are unable to increase the weight they can lift on a pushing exercise (such as the [[bench press]] or [[military press]]) for an extended period of time, strengthening the rotator cuff can often allow them to begin making gains again. It also prevents future injuries to the glenohumeral joint, balancing the often-dominant internal rotators with stronger external rotators. Finally, exercising the rotator cuff can lead to improved posture, as without exercise to the [[external rotator]], the internal rotators can see a shortening, leading to tightness. This often manifests itself as rounded shoulders.

Non-Operative Treatment

Non-operative treatment is often the first line of treatment for rotator cuff injuries.  If the tendons are strained or torn less than 50%, they respond well to an aggressive non-operative approach.  Non-operative measures can include physical therapy, oral or injected medications, biologic augmentation such as PRP, ultrasound therapy, dry needling, and other modalities.  It will often take 3 months to recover with non-operative measures.

====Surgery====
Even for full thickness rotator cuff tears, conservative care (i.e., non-surgical treatment) outcomes are usually reasonably good.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baydar M, Akalin E, El O, ''et al.'' |title=The efficacy of conservative treatment in patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears |journal=Rheumatology International |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=623–8 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=18850322 |doi=10.1007/s00296-008-0733-2}}</ref> However, many patients still suffer disability and pain despite non-surgical therapies.  For massive tears of the rotator cuff, surgery has shown durable outcomes on 10 year follow-up.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zumstein MA, Jost B, Hempel J, Hodler J, Gerber C |title=The clinical and structural long-term results of open repair of massive tears of the rotator cuff |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

tears of the rotator cuff.  Shen has shown that MRI evidence of fatty atrophy in the rotator cuff prior to surgery is predicative of a poor surgical outcome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shen PH, Lien SB, Shen HC, Lee CH, Wu SS, Lin LC |title=Long-term functional outcomes after repair of rotator cuff tears correlated with atrophy of the supraspinatus muscles on magnetic resonance images |journal=Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery |volume=17 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=1S–7S |year=2008 |pmid=17931908 |doi=10.1016/j.jse.2007.04.014}}</ref> If the rotator cuff is completely torn, surgery is usually required to reattach the tendon to the bone.<ref>{{cite web |first=Frederick A. |last=Matsen |coauthors=Winston J.

[Surgery for the Rotator Cuff]

Surgery for the rotator cuff can be for complete tears, or partial tears/strains that fail to get better.  If a torn rotator cuff goes untreated for too long, it may become un-repairable and so shoulder pain should not be ignored.  Surgery often consists of removing damaged tissue and repairing the good tissue back to the bone.  Bone spurs and inflammation (bursitis) is also removed to try to prevent re-tears.  all arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs can fix most tears through 4-5 small incisions.  On occasion a patch needs to be placed on the rotator cuff tendons which requires a larger incision.  Many times, the biceps tendon is damaged with rotator cuff tears and may also require biceps tenodesis surgery at the same time.

Rehab

The rehab for rotator cuff surgery falls into three basic categories; some damage to the tendons with surgery consisting of debridement, removing spurs and cleaning out inflammation, tears requiring repair with excellent quality tendon tissue, and tears requiring repair with poor quality tendon tissue.  The first category, rehab consists of early active and passive range of motion exercises focused on maintaining range of motion for 4 weeks and then strengthening and return to sports from weeks 4-8.  Repaired tendons with excellent quality will begin full passive motion early, start active motion from weeks 4-8, strengthening from 8-12 and return to sports after 3–4 months.  Repairs with poor tissue quality will have no motion early on, start passive motion after 2–4 weeks, active at 6–8 weeks, strengthening at 4 months and return to sports at 6 months.  Your doctor will guide you through the rehabilitation process.

==Imaging==

===Shoulder imaging===
There are several ways to depict the structures of the shoulder, which consist of muscles, tendons, bones, cartilage and soft tissue. When deciding which medical imaging technique should be used, there are a couple of factors that need to be taken into account. Firstly, one has to consider the  suspected clinical diagnosis. Together with the knowledge of the advantages and limitations of the various medical imaging techniques ( i.e. conventional radiography, ultrasound, computer tomography and magnetic resonance), one has to make an informed decision which technique would best suit the specific situation.
<br />
Hodler et al. recommend to start scanning with conventional x-rays taken from at least two planes, since this method gives a wide first impression and even has the chance of exposing any frequent shoulder pathologies, i.e. decompensated rotator cuff tears, tendinitis calcarea, dislocations, fractures, usures and/or osteophytes. Furthermore, x-rays are required for the planning of an optimal CT or MR image.<ref>Hodler J et al.. Gelenkdiagnostik mit bildgebenden Verfahren. Stuttgart [etc.]. G. Thieme. 1992. ISBN 3-13-780501-5</ref>
<br />
Conventional x-rays and ultrasonography are the primary tools used to confirm a diagnosis of injuries sustained to the rotator cuff. For extended clinical questions, imaging through Magnetic Resonance with or without intraarticular contrast agent is indicated.<br />
The conventional invasive arthrography is now-a-days being replaced by the non-invasive MRI and US and is used as an imaging reserve for patients who are contraindicated for MRI, for example pacemaker-carriers with an unclear and unsure ultrasonography.<ref name="springerlink.com">Hedtmann A et al.. Imaging in evaluating rotator cuff tears. Orthopade. 2007 Sep;36(9):796-809. - (http://www.springerlink.com/content/26l346817932h383/)</ref>

===Conventional x-rays===

====a.-p.-projection 40° posterior oblique after Grashey====
[[File:CR. shoulder x-ray, a.p..jpg|thumb|CR. shoulder x-ray, a.p.]]
The scapula should be positioned parallel to the x-ray film. The body has to be rotated about 30 to 45 degrees towards the shoulder to be imaged, and the standing or sitting patient lets the arm hang.
<br />
This method allows the diagnostician to judge:<ref name="springerlink.com"/>
* The joint gap and the vertical alignment towards the socket.
<br />
The humerus head should be aligned in the neutral position and external rotation in a way towards the socket, that a fictive continuous line can be seen. This line is called Bandi line, otherwise known as the Ménard-Shenton line. A discontinuous line alludes to a cranial decentralization of the humerus head.<ref>Bandi W (1981) Die Läsion der Rotatorenmanschette. Helv Chir Acta 48:537-549</ref>

====Transaxillary projection====
[[Image:Transaxillary CR shoulder.jpg|thumb|alt=A Transaxillary conventional radiography|Transaxillary conventional radiography]][[File:Transaxillary projection. Schematic drawing..jpg|thumb|Transaxillary projection. Schematic drawing. After "Orthopedic radiology: a practical approach; Adam Greenspan; ISBN 0-7817-1589-X, 9780781715898"]]
The arm should be abduced 80 to 100 degrees at a precise defined scapular or frontal plane.
<br />
This method allows the diagnostician to judge:<ref name="springerlink.com"/>
* The horizontal alignment of the humerus head in respect to the socket, and the lateral clavicle in respect to the acromion.
* Lesions of the anterior and posterior socket border or of the tuberculum minus.
* The eventual non-closure of the acromial apophysis.
* The coraco-humeral interval

====Y-projection====
[[Image:Y CR shoulder.jpg|thumb|alt=A Y-projection conventional radiography|Y-projection conventional radiography]]
The lateral contour of the shoulder should be positioned in front of the film in a way that the longitudinal axis of the scapula continues parallel to the path of the rays.
<br />
This method allows the diagnostician to judge:<ref name="springerlink.com"/>
* The horizontal centralization of the humerus head and socket.
* The osseous margins of the coraco-acromial arch and hence the supraspinatus outlet canal.
* The shape of the acromion
<br />
This Y-projection can be traced back to Wijnblath’s 1933 published cavitas-en-face projection.<ref>Wijnbladh H (1933) Zur Röntgendiagnose von Schulterluxationen. Chirurg 5:702</ref>
<br />
It must be pointed out that this projection has a low tolerance for errors and accordingly needs proper execution.<ref name="springerlink.com"/>

===Ultrasound===
There are several solid advantages of ultrasound. It is relatively cheap, does not emit any radiation, is accessible, is capable of visualizing tissue function in real time and allows to the performing of provocative maneuvers in order to replicate the patient’s pain. Those apparent benefits have helped ultrasound become a common initial choice for assessing tendons and soft tissues. Limitations include, for example, the high degree of operator dependence and the inability to define pathologies in bones. One also has to have an extensive anatomical knowledge of the examined region and keep an open mind to normal variations and artifacts created during the scan.<ref>Broadhurst NA. Musculoskeletal ultrasound - used to best advantage. Aust Fam Physician. 2007 Jun;36(6):430-2. - free article(http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200706/200706broadhurst.pdf)</ref>
<br />
Although musculo-skeletal ultrasound training, like medical training in general, is a lifelong process, Kissin et al. suggest that rheumatologists who taught themselves how to manipulate ultrasound can use it just as well as international musculo-skeletal ultrasound experts to diagnose common rheumatic conditions.<ref>Kissin et al.. Self-directed learning of basic musculo-skeletal ultrasound among rheumatologists in the United States. Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken). 2010 Feb;62(2):155-60 - (http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123236784/abstract)</ref>
<br />
After the introduction of high-frequency transducers in the mid-eighties, ultrasound has become a conventional tool for taking accurate and precise images of the shoulder to support diagnosis.<ref>Allen GM, Wilson DJ, Eur J Ultrasound. 2001 Oct;14(1):3-9. Review - (http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0929826601001409)</ref><ref>Middleton WD, Edelstein G, et al. Sonographic detection of rotator cuff tears.

<br />
Adequate for the examination are high-resolution, high-frequency transducers with a transmission frequency of 5, 7.5 and 10&nbsp;MHz. To improve the focus on structures close to the skin an additional „water start-up length“ is advisable. During the examination the patient is asked to be seated, the affected arm is then adducted and the elbow is bent to 90 degrees. Slow and cautious passive lateral and/or medial rotations have the effect of being able to visualize different sections of the shoulder. In order to also demonstrate those parts which are hidden under the acromion in the neutral position, a maximum medial rotation with hyperextension behind the back is required.<ref>Thelen M. et al.. Radiologische Diagnostik der Verletzungen von Knochen und Gelenken. Stuttgart [etc.]. Georg Thieme. 1993. ISBN 3-13-778701-7</ref>
<br />
To avoid the different tendon echogenicities caused by different instrument settings, Middleton compared the tendon’s echogenicity with that of the deltoid muscle, which is still lege artis.<ref>Middleton WD. et al.. Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff: technique and normal anatomy. J Ultrasound Med.. 1984 Dec;3(12):549-51</ref><ref>Middleton WD. et al.. Pitfalls of rotator cuff sonography. AJR AM J Roentgenol. 1986 Mar;146(3):555-60 @Katthagen BD. et al.. Schultersonographie. Stuttgart. ISBN 3-13-719401-6 - free article(http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/146/3/555)</ref>
<br />
Usually the echogenicity compared to the deltoid muscle is homogeneous intensified without dorsal echo extinction. Variability with reduced or intensified<ref>crass 1984 @Katthagen BD. et al.. Schultersonographie. Stuttgart. ISBN 3-13-719401-6</ref> echo has also been found in healthy tendons. Bilateral comparison is very helpful when distinguishing and setting boundaries between physiological variants and a possible pathological finding. Degenerative changes at the rotator cuff often are found on both sides of the body. Consequently unilateral differences rather point to a pathological source and bilateral changes rather to a physiological variation.<ref>Middleton WD. et al.. Pitfalls of rotator cuff sonography. AJR AM J Roentgenol. 1986 Mar;146(3):555-60</ref>
<br />
In addition, a dynamic examination can help to differentiate between an ultrasound artifact and a real pathology.<ref>Hedtmann A. et al.. Atlas und Lehrbuch der Schultersonographie. Stuttgart. 1988@ Hodler J et al.. Gelenkdiagnostik mit bildgebenden Verfahren. Stuttgart [etc.]. G. Thieme. 1992. ISBN 3-13-780501-5</ref>
<br />
To accurately evaluate the echogenicity of an ultrasound, one has to take into account the physical laws of reflection, absorption and dispersion. It is at all times important to acknowledge that the structures in the joint of the shoulder are not aligned in the transversal, coronal or sagittal plane, and that therefore during imaging of the shoulder the transducer head has to be hold  perpendicularly or parallel to the structures of interest. Otherwise the appearing echogenicity may not be evaluated.<ref name="ReferenceA">Katthagen BD. et al.. Schultersonographie. Stuttgart. ISBN 3-13-719401-6</ref>
<br />
Orientation-aid for the longitudinal plane:<br />
As an aid to orientation, it is advisable to begin the examination with the delineation of the acromion, as it is easy to palpate and it has an identifiable echo extinction. To adjust the longitudinal plane image the way it is known in the x-rays and the physical examination, the acromion has to be visible at the image border.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
<br />
Orientation-aid for the transversal plane:<br />
Again it is advantageous to start above the acromion and then move the transducer to the humerus. The acromion echo extinction disappears and the wheel-like figure with almost concentric projection of the deltoid muscle, supraspinatus muscle tendon and humeral head-outline turns up as soon as the transducer is directed perpendicularly and parallel to the acromion edge. Using the anterior transversal plane one can depict the intraarticular part of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle. Additionally one can use the posterior transversal plane to depict the intersection of the infraspinatus muscle tendon and the posterior edge of the fossa.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===MRI===
Orthopedics established early the MRI as the tool of choice for joint- and soft tissue-imaging, because its non-invasiveness, the lack of radiation exposure, multi planar slicing possibilities and the high soft tissue contrast.<ref>Trattnig S. et al.. High-field and ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging: new possibilities for imaging joints. Z Rheumatol. 2006 Dec;65(8):681-7 - (http://www.springerlink.com/content/54r55191m43327j5/)</ref>
<br />
The MR Imaging should provide joint details to the treating orthopedist, to help him diagnose and decide the next appropriate therapeutic step.
To examine the shoulder, the patient is lying and the concerned arm is in lateral rotation. For signal detection it is recommended to use a surface-coil. To find pathologies of the rotator cuff in the basic diagnostic investigation, T2-weighted sequences with fat-suppression or STIR sequences have proven  value. In general, the examination should occur in the following three main planes: axial, oblique coronal and sagittal.<ref name="ReferenceB">Romaneehsen B. et al.. MR imaging of tendon diseases. Exemplified using the examples of rotator cuff, epicondylitis and achillodynia. Orthopade. 2005 Jun;34(6):543-9 - (http://www.springerlink.com/content/r60654q134376711/)</ref>
<br />
Most morphological changes and injuries are sustained to the supraspinatus tendon. Traumatic rotator cuff changes are often located antero-superior, meanwhile degenerative changes more likely are supero-posterior.<ref>Nové-Josserand L, Gerber C, Walch G (1997) Lesions of the antero-superior rotator cuff. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia</ref>

Tendons are predominantly composed of dense collagen fiber bundles. Because of their extreme short T2-relaxation time they appear typically signal-weak, respectively, dark. Degenerative changes, inflammations and also partial and complete tears cause loss of the original tendon structure. Fatty deposits, mucous degeneration and hemorrhages lead to an increased intratendinal T1-image. Edema formations, inflammatory changes and ruptures increase the signals in a T2-weighted image.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

====Magic angle artifact====
[[File:Magic angle artifact.jpg|thumb|MRI. Magic angle artifact.]]
Erickson et al. noticed and described a typical artifact and gave the phenomenon the name „magic angle“. The „magic angle“ describes a changed T2-relaxation time depending on the spatial orientation of the tissue to the main magnetic field. If parts of the tendon are located at the area of the magic angle at 55 degrees to the main magnetic field, their T2-relaxation time gets influenced and the signal heavily intensified. Unluckily these artifacts occupy similar areas where clinical relevant pathologies are found. To avoid a wrong diagnosis it is recommended to exclude this phenomenon in a case of doubt through a heavy T2-weighted sequence or an additional fat-suppression at a proton weighted sequence.<ref>Erickson SJ, Cox IH, Hyde JS, Car re ra GF, Strandt JA, Estkowski LD (1991) Effect of tendon orientation on MR imaging signal intensity: a manifestation of the „magic angle“ phenomenon.

====MRA====
While using MRI, true lesions at the rotator interval region between the parts of the supraspinatus and subscapularis are all but impossible to distinguish from normal synovium and capsule.<ref>Seeger LL, Lubowitz J, Thomas BJ (1993) Case report 815: Tear of the rotator interval. Skeletal Radiol 22(8): 615–617</ref><br />
In 1999, Weishaupt D. et al. reached through two readers a significant better visibility of pully lesions at the rotator interval and the expected location of the reflection pulley of the long biceps and subscapularis tendon on parasagittal (reader1/reader2 sensitivity: 86%/100%; specificity: 90%/70%) and axial (reader1/reader2 sensitivity: 86%/93%; specificity: 90%/80%) MRA images.<ref>Weishaupt D, Zanetti M, Tanner A et al. (1999) Lesions of the reflection pulley of the long biceps tendon. MR arthrographic findings. Invest Radiol 34: 463–469 @Hedtmann A. et al.. Imaging in evaluating rotator cuff tears. Orthopade. 2007 Sep;36(9):796-809 - (http://www.springerlink.com/content/26l346817932h383/)</ref><br />
When examining the rotator cuff, the MRA has a couple of advantages compared to the native MRI. Through a fat suppressed T2-weighted spin echo, MRA can reproduce an extreme high fat-water-contrast, which helps to detect water-deposits with better damage diagnosis in structurally changed collagen fiber bundles.<ref>Palmer WE, Brown JH, Rosenthal DI (1993) Rotator cuff: evaluation with fat-suppressed MR arthrography.Radiology 188:683–687</ref>
