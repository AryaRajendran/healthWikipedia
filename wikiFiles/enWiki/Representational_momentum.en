'''Representational momentum''' is a small, but reliable, error in our [[visual perception]] of moving objects.<ref name=Freyd/>  Instead of knowing the exact location of a moving object, we actually think it is a bit further along its trajectory.  For example, people viewing an object moving from left to right that suddenly disappears will report they saw it a bit further to the right than where it actually vanished. While not a big error, it has been found in a variety of different events ranging from simple rotations<ref name=Freyd>{{cite journal|last=Freyd|first=J. J.|coauthors=Finke, R. A.|title=Representational momentum|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1984|volume=10|pages=126–132}}</ref>  to camera movement through a scene.<ref name=park>{{cite journal|last=Munger|first=M.

M.|title=Representational momentum in scenes: Learning spatial layout|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=2006|volume=34|pages=1557–1568}}</ref>  The name "representational momentum" initially reflected the idea that the forward displacement was the result of the perceptual system having internalized, or evolved to include, basic principles of [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Freyd|first=J. J.|title=Dynamic mental representations|journal=Psychological Review|year=1987|volume=94|pages=427–438}}</ref> but it has come to mean forward displacements that continue a presented pattern along a variety of dimensions, not just position or orientation.<ref name = Hubbard-theories>{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=T.

==Methods==
Representational Momentum has been studied using two types of displays: implied motion (left panel) and smooth animations (right panel).  Implied events show a series of pictures that suggest a motion, but at a slow frame rate so there is no [[phi phenomenon|apparent motion.]]  Smooth animations have also been used, where the animation is briefly interrupted and then participants either indicate whether a static probe is in the same position as the final frame of the animation (right panel),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Munger|first=M. P.|coauthors=Owens, T. R.|title=Representational momentum and the flash-lag effect|journal=Visual Cognition|year=2004|volume=11|pages=81–103}}</ref>  or are asked to indicate with a mouse cursor exactly where the object disappeared.<ref name=Hubbard1>{{cite journal|last=Hubbard,|first=T. L.|coauthors=Bharucha, J. J.|title=Judged displacement in apparent vertical and horizontal motion.|journal=Perception & Psychophysics|year=1988|volume=44|pages=211–221}}</ref>  The basic result is that participants either use the mouse to click beyond the vanishing point, or misidentify forward positioned probes as the location where the object disappeared.  So, instead of indicating that the actual 0° probe in a rotation event is the same, participants will say that probes  appearing 2°-4° past the vanishing point actually seem to be at the vanishing point itself.  However, they will quite readily reject probes that are behind the vanishing point by 2°-4°.

==Specific results==
Initial studies established that representational momentum occurs for rotations in<ref name=Freyd /> and movements across the picture plane, with larger distortions occurring with faster velocities<ref>{{cite journal|last=Freyd|first=J. J.|coauthors=Finke, R. A.|title=A velocity effect for representational momentum|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|year=1985|volume=23|pages=443–446}}</ref> and when downward motion is presented.<ref name=Hubbard1 />  Moreover, the overall pattern of the motion is anticipated, so that when shown an oscillatory motion, like a pendulum, the object is remembered as continuing the larger pattern.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verfaillie|first=K.|coauthors=d’Ydewalle, G.|title=Representational momentum and event course anticipation in the perception of implied periodical motions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1991|volume=17|pages=302–313}}</ref>  In other words, when asked to judge where the object is just as it would normally reverse directions, probes in the reverse direction are accepted as same, not probes that would continue the most immediate, local motion.

===The importance of labeling===
The degree of representational momentum observed can depend on how the participant is labeling the event or object.  For example, if told just before a trial that the object will "crash" against a wall, smaller distortions will be observed than if told the object is going to "bounce."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=T. L.|title=Judged displacement: A modular process?|journal=American Journal of Psychology|year=1994|volume=107|pages=359–373}}</ref>  More representational momentum is also observed when participants are told a triangular shape is a "rocket" compared to when the same shape is called a "church,"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reed|first=C. L.|coauthors=Vinson, N. G.|title=Conceptual effects on representational momentum|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1996|volume=22|pages=839–850}}</ref>  however, the overall pointedness of the shape is more important than object identity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nagai|first=M.|coauthors=Yagi, A.|title=Pointedness effect on representational momentum|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=2001|volume=29|pages=91–99}}</ref>

===Motion in depth===
Objects can rotate about many different depth axes (e.g., consider the difference between a somersault and a spin) and more representational momentum occurs with axes of rotation that run through the center of the object compared to off-center rotations.<ref name=cubes>{{cite journal|last=Munger|first=M. P.|coauthors=Solberg, J. L., Horrocks, K. K., & Preston, A. S.|title=Representational momentum for rotations in depth: Effects of shadings and axis|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1999|volume=25|pages=157–171}}</ref> When presented with an event depicting the view from a camera moving through a scene, representational momentum occurs for the camera view, both for rotations (like turning your head)<ref name=park />  and movements in the scene.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thorton|first=I. M.|coauthors=Hayes, A. E.|title=Anticipating action in complex scenes|journal=Visual Cognition|year=2004|volume=11|pages=341–370}}</ref>   More representational momentum occurs for views where objects are entering the scene, compared to rotating out of view (see example movies).<ref name=park />

===Sound===
Auditory representational momentum has been found for sounds moving about the listener,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Geztmann|first=S.|coauthors=Lewald, J.|title=Localization of moving sound|journal=Perception & Psychophysics|year=2007|volume=69|pages=1022–1034}}</ref> but patterns of change can be established in dimensions beyond position.  For example, consider a rising tone in pitch.  Auditory representational momentum, where a pitch further along the presented pattern is misidentified as the actual ending pitch, has been found for both simple rises and falls in pitch,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=T. L.|title=Auditory representational momentum: Surface form, velocity, and direction effects|journal=American Journal of Psychology|year=1995|volume=108|pages=255–274}}</ref> along with more complicated periodic patterns.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=H. M.|coauthors=Jones, M. R.|title=Higher order pattern structure influences auditory representational momentum|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=2006|volume=32|pages=2–17}}</ref>

===Expertise===
Individual differences in the magnitude of representational momentum reveal that extensive training and experience with particular kinds of dynamic events allow experts to more readily continue the motion of the display.<ref name=pilots >{{cite journal|last=Blattler|first=C.|coauthors=Ferrari, V., Didierjean, A. & Marmeche, E.|title=Representational momentum in aviation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=2011|doi=10.1037/a0023512}}</ref> In particular, pilots with extensive experience (average 3,198 of flying hours) showed more representational momentum to flight simulator landing scenes than did novices.  Novices showed no forward distortion with the forward probes pilots anticipated, but when smaller anticipations were probed, novices were able to anticipate forward motion.  Experts more readily anticipate the dynamic scene, resulting in larger representational momentum.<ref name=pilots />

===Grasping===
Being able to estimate an object's size in order to pick it up involves an integration of visual information and motor control.  Upon viewing implied motion depicting the handles of a pair of pliers either opening or closing, participants change their physical hand grip size in keeping with representational momentum, anticipating the future position of the handles.<ref name=pliers>{{cite journal|last=Brouwer|first=A. M.|coauthors=Thornton, I. M., & Franz, V. H.|title=Forward displacement in grasping and visually judging pliers|journal=Visual Cognition|year=2005|volume=12|pages=800–816}}</ref>  While the hand action anticipates the continued opening (or closing) of the pliers, visual judgments of the object's final handle position consistently underestimate the opening, indicating that the relationship between visual judgments and subsequent physical acts is not straightforward.<ref name=pliers />

===Luminance===
Events depicting changes in luminance, or how bright a patch of color appears, do not lead to forward distortions in memory similar to representational momentum, but instead show backwards distortions.<ref name=light>{{cite journal|last=Brehaut|first=J. C.|coauthors=Tipper, S. P.|title=Representational momentum and memory for luminance|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1996|volume=22|pages=480–501}}</ref>  In other words, upon viewing an object getting progressively lighter and asked to remember the final shade, participants accept a darker version of the object (where a representational momentum parallel would be to accept a lighter shade).  One suggestion for this difference is that memory is playing more of a role in determining color.<ref name=light />
