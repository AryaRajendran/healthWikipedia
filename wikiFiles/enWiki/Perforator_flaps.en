'''Perforator flap surgery''' is a technique used in [[reconstructive surgery]] where skin and/or [[subcutaneous fat]] are removed from a distant or adjacent part of the body to reconstruct the excised part.<ref name="Gent consensus">{{cite journal |author=Blondeel PN, Van Landuyt KH, Monstrey SJ, ''et al.'' |title=The "Gent" consensus on perforator flap terminology: preliminary definitions |journal=Plast.

Some perforators can have a mixed septal and intramuscular course before reaching the skin. The name of the particular flap is retrieved from its perforator and not from the underlying muscle.<ref name="Gent consensus" /> If there is a potential to harvest multiple perforator flaps from one vessel, the name of each flap is based on its anatomical region or muscle. For example a perforator that only traverses through the septum to supply the underlying skin is called a septal perforator. Whereas a flap that is vascularised by a perforator traversing only through muscle to supply the underlying skin is called a muscle perforator.<ref name="Gent consensus" /> According to the distinct origin of their vascular supply, perforators can be classified into direct and indirect perforators. Direct perforators only pierce the [[deep fascia]], they don't traverse any other structural tissue. Indirect perforators first run through other structures before piercing the [[deep fascia]].<ref name="Gent consensus" />

==Overview==
Soft tissue defects due to trauma or after tumor extirpation are important medical and cosmetic topics. Therefore reconstructive surgeons have developed a variety of surgical techniques to conceal the soft tissue defects by using tissue transfers, better known as flaps. In the course of time these flaps have rapidly evolved from "random-pattern flaps with an unknown blood supply, through axial-pattern flaps with a known blood supply to muscle and musculocutaneous perforator flaps" for the sole purpose of optimal reconstruction with minimum donor-site [[morbidity]].<ref name="Morris">{{cite journal |author=Morris S |title=Perforator flaps: a microsurgical innovation |journal=Medscape J Med |volume=10 |issue=11 |page=266 |year=2008 |pmid=19099016 |pmc=2605127 }}</ref>

==Classification==
Perforator flaps can be classified in many different ways. Regarding the distinct origin of their blood supply and the structures they cross before they pierce the [[deep fascia]], perforators can either be direct perforators or indirect perforators.<ref name="Hallock">{{cite journal |author=Hallock GG |title=Direct and indirect perforator flaps: the history and the controversy |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=111 |issue=2 |pages=855–65; quiz 866 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12560714 |doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000040462.38363.C7 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=111&issue=2&spage=855}}</ref> We will discuss this classification based on the perforators' anatomy below. [[File:Direct and indirect perforators.png|thumb|Direct and indirect perforators]]

===Direct cutaneous===
Direct cutaneous perforators only perforate the [[deep fascia]], they do not traverse any other structural tissue.<ref name="Hallock" />

It’ s questionable whether these perforators are true perforators, because it might be more logical to not include these perforators. The surgical approach needed for direct perforators is slightly different from the one needed for indirect perforators. When direct perforators are not included, surgeons can focus on the anatomy of the perforator and the source vessel.<ref name="Gent consensus" />

===Indirect cutaneous===
Indirect cutaneous perforators traverse other structures before going through the [[deep fascia]]. These other structures are deeper tissues, and consist of mainly muscle, septum or [[epimysium]].<ref name="Hallock" /> According to the clinical relevance, two types of indirect cutaneous perforators need to be distinguished.<ref name="Gent consensus" /> We will clarify these two types below.

====Muscle and musculocutaneous====
Musculocutaneous perforators supply the overlying skin by traversing through muscle before they pierce the [[deep fascia]].<ref name="Gent consensus" /> 

A perforator which traverses muscle before piercing the [[deep fascia]] can do that either transmuscular or transepimysial. This latter subdivision is however not taken into account during the [[dissection]] of the perforator. Only the size, position, and course of the perforator vessel are considered then.<ref name="Gent consensus" />

When a flaps’ blood supply depends on a muscle perforator, this flap is called a muscle perforator flap.<ref name="Gent consensus" />

====Septal and septocutaneous====
Septocutaneous perforators supply the overlying skin by traversing through an intermuscular septum before they pierce the deep fascia. These perforators are cutaneous side branches of muscular vessels and perforators.<ref name="Gent consensus" />

When a flap's blood supply depends on a septal perforator, this flap is called a septal perforator flap.<ref name="Gent consensus" />

===Nomenclature===
Due to confusion about the definition and nomenclature of perforator flaps, a consensus meeting was held in Gent, Belgium, on September 29, 2001. Regarding the nomenclature of these flaps, the authors stated the following:

"''A perforator flap should be named after the nutrient artery or vessels and not after the underlying muscle. If there is a potential to harvest multiple perforator flaps from one vessel, the name of each flap should be based on its anatomical region or muscle.''" <ref name="Gent consensus" />

This so-called 'gent consensus' was needed because the lack of definitions and standard rules on terminology created confusion in communication between surgeons.<ref name="Gent consensus" />

==Method of application==
Flaps can be transferred either free or pedicled. Regarding the nomenclature, one is free to add the type of transfer to the name of a flap.<ref name="Gent consensus" />

===Free perforator flaps===
A free flap is defined as a tissue mass that has been taken away from the original site to be used in tissue transplantation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Free flaps |work=Pubmed MESH terms database  |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=free%20flaps}}</ref> When a surgeon uses a free flap, the blood supply is cut and the pedicle reattached to recipient vessels, performing a microsurgical anastomosis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guyuron |first1=Bahman |first2=Elok |last2=Eriksson, |first3=John A. |last3=Persing |chapter=Ch. 9: Microsurgery and Free Flaps |editor= |title=Plastic Surgery: Indications and practice |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |volume=1 |year=2009 |isbn=987-1-4160-4081-1 }}</ref> 

For more information on free flaps, see also [[free flap]].

===Pedicled perforator flaps===
Pedicled perforator flaps can be tranferred either by translation or rotation. These two types will be discussed separately below.

====Translation====
This type of transfer is also called "advancement".The surgeon disconnects the flap from the body, except for the perforators. After this procedure, the flap is advanced into the defect.<ref name="Guyuron et al">Guyuron, Bahman; Elof Eriksson, John A. Persing (2009). Chapter 8: Flaps. Plastic Surgery: Indications and Practice. Saunders Elsevier. ISBN 987-1-4160-4081-1</ref>

====Rotation====
The subgroup of pedicled perforator flaps, transferred in the defect by rotation is the so-called "propeller flap". 
Confusion concerning definition, nomenclature and classification of propellor flaps led to a consensus meeting similar to the "gent consensus meeting”. The consensus that was reached is named "the tokyo consensus". This article stipulates the definitions of propeller flaps and especially perforator propeller flaps.<ref name="Tokyo consensus">{{cite journal |author=Pignatti M, Ogawa R, Hallock GG, ''et al.'' |title=The "Tokyo" consensus on propeller flaps |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=716–22 |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21285776 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181fed6b2 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=127&issue=2&spage=716}}</ref> The definition that was set up is cited below:

''"A propeller flap can be defined as an “island flap that reaches the recipient site through an axial rotation.” Every skin island flap can become a propeller flap. However, island flaps that reach the recipient site through an advancement movement and flaps that move through a rotation but are not completely islanded are excluded from this definition. "''  <ref name="Tokyo consensus" /> 
[[File:Propeller flap.png|thumb|Propeller flap]]

Regarding the classification of propeller flaps, the surgeon should specify several aspects of these flaps. It is important that the type of nourishing pedicle, the degree of skin island rotation and, when possible, the artery of origin of the perforator vessel are mentioned.<ref name="Tokyo consensus" />

The perforator propeller flap is the propeller flap which is used most commonly. It is a perforator flap with a skin island, which is separated in a larger and smaller paddle by the nourishing perforator. These paddles can rotate around the perforator (pedicle), for as many degrees as the anatomical situation requires (90-180 degrees). This flap looks like a propeller when the two paddles are not too different in size.<ref name="Tokyo consensus" />

==Fields of application==
Trauma, oncological treatments or pressure ulcers can result in severe tissue defects. Those defects can be covered and closed by using autologe tissue transposition. The fact that each tissue defect is different makes it necessary for each tissue defect to be assessed individually. The choice of the type of tissue transposition depends on the location, nature, extent and status of the deformity.<ref name="S. Klein">{{cite journal |author=Klein S, Hage JJ, de Weerd L |title=[Perforator flaps--the evolution of a reconstructive surgical technique] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=149 |issue=43 |pages=2392–8 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16277128 }}</ref>

However, the health of the patient and possible contra-indications play an important role as well. Due to the development and improvement of cutaneous, myocutanous and fasciocutaneous tissue transpositions plastic surgeons are able to successfully restore the defect to its original shape.<ref name="S. Klein" /> Nevertheless, functional recovery is not guaranteed in all patients. For the optimal renewal of shape and function, a suitable  flap can be chosen to reconstruct the defect. In the case of using a so-called perforator flap, a reliable vascularization and the possibility of sensory (re) innervation can be combined with less donor-site morbidity and limited loss of  function in the donor area.<ref name="S. Klein" />

===Oncological background===
The surgical removal of both benign and [[malignant tumor]]s often result in serious tissue defects involving not only soft tissue but also parts of the bone.<ref name="Schulten EAJM">{{cite journal |author=Schulten EA, Winters HA, Koch AE |title=[Reconstruction after surgical treatment of head and neck cancer: surgical and prosthetic possibilities] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Tandheelkd |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=215–23 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18512520 }}</ref> Depending on the location aneligible flap can be selected. In breast reconstruction for example, perforator flaps have raised the standard by replacing like with like.<ref name="Jay W. Granzow">{{cite journal |author=Granzow JW, Levine JL, Chiu ES, LoTempio MM, Allen RJ |title=Breast reconstruction with perforator flaps |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17572536 |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000256044.66107.a6 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=120&issue=1&spage=1}}</ref> When taking [[breast reconstruction]] into consideration, several surgical options are available to achieve lasting natural results with decreased donor-site deformities. The broad option of donor-sites makes practically all patients candidates for autogenous perforator flap reconstruction.<ref name="Jay W. Granzow" /> Some examples include, Deep inferior epigastric perforator flap ([[DIEP flap]]), superior gluteal (SGAP) flaps and inferior gluteal (IGAP) flaps.

===Traumatic background===
Treatment of tissue defects caused after a trauma present major surgical challenges especially those of the upper and lower limb, due to the fact that they often not only cause damage to the skin but also to bones, muscles/[[tendon]]s, vessels and/or [[nerve]]s.<ref name="Alexandru V. Georgescu">{{cite journal |author=Georgescu AV, Capota I, Matei I, ''et al.'' |title=The place of local/regional perforator flaps in complex traumas of the forearm |journal=J Hand Microsurg |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=25–31 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=23129928 |pmc=3453204 |doi=10.1007/s12593-009-0007-6 }}</ref>

If there is extensive destruction a [[fasciotomy]] is needed, therefore it is generally accepted that the best way to cover these types of tissue defects is a  free flap transplantation.<ref name="Koshima I">{{cite journal |author=Koshima I, Moriguchi T, Etoh H, Tsuda K, Tanaka H |title=The radial artery perforator-based adipofascial flap for dorsal hand coverage |journal=Ann Plast Surg |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=474–9 |year=1995 |month=November |pmid=8579264 }}</ref><ref name="Alexandru V.

In the case of upper limb surgery, perforator flaps are successfully used in minor and major soft tissue defects provided that in major defects the flap is precisely planed.<ref name="Alexandru V.

In lower limb surgery there have also been reports of successful use of perforator flaps.<ref name="Rad AN">{{cite journal |author=Rad AN, Christy MR, Rodriguez ED, Brazio P, Rosson GD |title=The anterior tibialis artery perforator (ATAP) flap for traumatic knee and patella defects: clinical cases and anatomic study |journal=Ann Plast Surg |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=210–6 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20098108 |doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181a13dd6 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-7043&volume=64&issue=2&spage=210}}</ref><ref name="Omar Quaba">{{cite journal |author=Quaba O, Quaba A |title=Pedicled Perforator Flaps for the Lower Limb |journal=Semin Plast Surg |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=103–111 |date=May 2006 |doi=10.1055/s-2006-941717 }}</ref>

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Twenty three years after the first perforator flap was described by Koshima and Soeda,<ref name="Koshima I" /> there has been a significant step towards covering tissue defects by using only cutaneous tissue.<ref name="LoTempio MM">{{cite journal |author=LoTempio MM, Allen RJ |title=Breast reconstruction with SGAP and IGAP flaps |journal=Plast.

Granzow" /> Furthermore patients have shown decreased postoperative pain and accelerated rehabilitation <ref name="Jay W.

Thus considering the complexity and length of this procedure microsurgical expertise is required and patients need to undergo a longer period of anesthetics that of course could result in increased risk factors.
