'''Red blood cell indices''' are [[blood test]]s that provide information about the [[hemoglobin]] content and size of [[red blood cells]].  Abnormal values indicate the presence of [[anemia]] and which type of anemia it is.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003648.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: RBC indices]</ref>

== Mean corpuscular volume ==
{{main|Mean corpuscular volume}}
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is the average size of a red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the [[hematocrit]] (Hct) by the red blood cell count.
* <math>MCV = \frac{Hct}{RBC}</math> x 10
* Normal range: 80-100 fL

== Mean corpuscular hemoglobin ==
{{main|Mean corpuscular hemoglobin}}
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is the average amount of [[hemoglobin]] (Hb) per red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the red blood cell count.  
*<math>MCH = \frac{Hb}{RBC}</math> x 10
*Normal range: 27-31 pg/cell

== Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ==
{{main|Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration}}
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is the average concentration of hemoglobin per red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the hematocrit.  
* <math>MCHC = \frac{Hb}{Hct}</math> x 100
* Normal range: 32-36 g/dL
