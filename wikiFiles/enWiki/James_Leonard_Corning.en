'''James Leonard Corning''' (1855&nbsp;– 1923) was an American [[Neurology|neurologist]], mainly known for his early experiments on [[neuraxial blockade]] in [[New York City]].

==Education==
Corning was born in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. When the [[American Civil War]] began in 1861, Corning's family moved to [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. Corning studied [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Stuttgart|Stuttgart Polytechnic Institute]] under [[Hermann von Fehling]]. He later studied [[physiology]] at [[Heidelberg University]] under [[Wilhelm Kühne]], and [[pathology]] at the [[University of Würzburg]]. After receiving his [[medical degree]] in 1878, he left Germany and visited [[Vienna]], [[Paris]], and [[London]] before finally returning to the United States.<ref name=Gorelick1987>{{cite journal|last=Gorelick|first=PB|last2=Zych|first2=D|title=James Leonard Corning and the early history of spinal puncture (abstract)|journal=Neurology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=672–4|year=1987|pmid=3550521|pmc=|doi=10.1212/WNL.37.4.672|url=http://www.neurology.org/content/37/4/672.extract}}</ref>

==Neuraxial blockade==
In 1884, [[Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|Karl Koller]] became the first to describe the [[anesthetic]] properties of [[cocaine]].<ref name=Koller1884>{{cite journal|last=Koller|first=K|authorlink=Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|title=Über die verwendung des kokains zur anästhesierung am auge|trans_title=On the use of cocaine for anesthesia on the eye|language=German|journal=Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift|volume=34|issue=|pages=1276–1309|year=1884|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> The following year, Corning [[Injection (medicine)|injected]] cocaine between the [[spinous process]]es of the lower [[lumbar vertebrae]], first in a dog and then in a healthy man.<ref name=Corning1885>{{cite journal|last=Corning|first=JL|title=Spinal anaesthesia and local medication of the cord|journal=New York Medical Journal|volume=42|issue=|pages=483–5|year=1885|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref><ref name=Corning1888>{{cite journal|last=Corning|first=JL|title=A further contribution on local medication of the spinal cord, with cases|journal=New York Medical Record|volume=|issue=|pages=291–3|year=1888|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> His experiments are the first published descriptions of the principle of [[neuraxial blockade]].<ref name=Gorelick1987/>

==Controversy==
On August 16, 1898, German surgeon [[August Bier]] (1861{{ndash}}1949) performed surgery under [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal anesthesia]] in [[Kiel]].<ref name=Bier1899>{{cite journal|last=Bier|first=A|authorlink=August Bier|title=Versuche uber cocainisirung des ruckenmarkes (Experiments on the cocainization of the spinal cord)|language=German|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Chirurgie|volume=51|issue=|pages=361–9|year=1899|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> Following the publication of Bier's experiments in 1899, a controversy developed about whether Bier or Corning performed the first successful spinal anesthetic.<ref name=Wulf1998>{{cite journal|last=Wulf|first=HFW|title=The centennial of spinal anesthesia|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=500–6|year=1998|doi=10.1097/00000542-199808000-00028|pmid=9710410|pmc=|url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=1998&issue=08000&article=00028&type=fulltext}}</ref><ref name=Marx1994>{{cite journal|last=Marx|first=GF|title=The first spinal anesthesia. Who deserves the laurels?|journal=Regional Anesthesia|volume=19|issue=6|pages=429–30|year=1994|pmid=7848956|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref>

There is no doubt that Corning's experiments preceded those of Bier. The controversy centers around whether Corning's injection was a [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]] or an [[epidural]] block. The dose of cocaine used by Corning was eight times higher than that used by Bier and [[Théodore Tuffier|Tuffier]]. Despite this much higher dose, the onset of [[analgesic|analgesia]] in Corning's human subject was slower and the [[Dermatome (anatomy)|dermatomal level]] of ablation of sensation was lower. Also, Corning did not describe seeing the flow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] in his reports, whereas both Bier and Tuffier did make these observations. Based on Corning's own description of his experiments, it is apparent that his injections were made into the [[epidural space]], and not the [[subarachnoid space]].<ref name=Marx1994/> Finally, Corning was incorrect in his theory on the [[mechanism of action]] of cocaine on the [[spinal nerve]]s and [[spinal cord]]. He proposed&nbsp;– mistakenly&nbsp;– that the cocaine was absorbed into the [[vein|venous circulation]] and subsequently transported to the spinal cord.<ref name=Marx1994/>

Although Bier properly deserves credit for the introduction of spinal anesthesia into the clinical practice of medicine, it was Corning who created the experimental conditions that ultimately led to the development of both spinal and epidural anesthesia.<ref name=Marx1994/>

==Other work==
During his career, Corning published at least forty articles and five books on topics relating to neurology and psychiatry.<ref name=Gorelick1987/> He studied the theory that [[epileptic seizure]]s were the result of increased [[Cerebral blood flow|blood flow to the brain]]. He proposed that reducing the cerebral blood flow would reduce the frequency and duration of seizure activity. To this end, he developed several instruments for the compression of the [[jugular vein]]. One of these devices was a fork-like compression tool for immediate treatment of seizures, and another was an adjustable belt-like instrument, sively used for preventing seizures. He later developed this approach in combination with other methods for reduction of cerebral blood flow, such as [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|transcutaneous electrical stimulation]] of the [[vagus nerve]]. This treatment method was abandoned due to its significant [[side effect]]s, which included [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], [[dizziness]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]]. [[Vagus nerve stimulation]] has since regained its status as an adjunctive treatment for certain types of epilepsy, especially [[partial seizure]]s,<ref name=Lanska2002>Lanska.'' J. L. Corning and vagal nerve stimulation for seizures in the 1880s.'' Neurology. 2002; 58 (3) :452-9. PMID 11839848</ref> and also as an adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant [[major depressive disorder]] in adults.<ref name=FDA2004>[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/04/briefing/4047b1_02_Summary%20of%20Safety%20and%20Effectiveness.pdf FDA Summary of VNS Data]</ref>
