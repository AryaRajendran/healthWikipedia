'''ICD-10''' is the 10th revision of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD), a [[medical classification]] list by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). It codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.<ref Name="WHOICD"/>

The code set allows more than 14,400 different codes and permits the tracking of many new [[diagnoses]]. The codes can be expanded to over 16,000 codes by using optional sub-classifications. The detail reported by ICD can be further increased, with a simplified multi-axial approach, by using codes meant to be reported in a separate data field.

The WHO provides detailed information about ICD online, and makes available a set of materials online, such as an ICD-10 online browser,<ref>[http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en ICD-10 online browser]{{verify source|date=January 2011}}</ref> ICD-10 Training, ICD-10 online training,<ref>[http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10training/ ICD-10 training tool]{{verify source|date=January 2011}}</ref> ICD-10 online training support,<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/icd10onlinetraining ICD 10 Online Support]</ref> and study guide materials for download.

The International version of ICD should not be confused with national Clinical Modifications of ICD that frequently include much more detail, and sometimes have separate sections for [[Post-operation|procedures]]. The US ICD-10 CM, for instance, has some 68,000 codes. The US also has ICD-10 PCS, a procedure code system not used by other countries that contains 76,000 codes.<ref Name="CMS_PressAug2008">{{cite press release

==National adoption for clinical use==
Some 25 countries use ICD-10 for reimbursement and resource allocation in their health system.  A few of them made modifications to ICD to better accommodate this use of ICD-10.  The article below makes reference to some of these modifications.  The unchanged international version of ICD-10 is used in about 110 countries  ICD-10 for cause of death reporting and statistics.
===South Africa===
1 January 2005 Pretoria, Johannesburg, Cape town
===Australia===
1 July 1998 Victoria, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory implemented ICD-10-AM.<br />
1 July 1999 Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia implemented ICD-10-AM.<ref>[http://www.health.qld.gov.au/qcc/documents/resources/icd_drg_qld11.pdf DRG and ICD information in Queensland]{{verify source|date=June 2012}}</ref>

===Canada===
[[Canada]] introduced ICD-10-CA in 2000.<ref>[http://www.cihi.ca/cihi-ext-portal/internet/en/document/standards+and+data+submission/standards/classification+and+coding/codingclass_icd10 "ICD10-CA"]</ref>

===China===
[[China]] now using ICD-10 as diagnosis  reference and ICD-9 as procedure reference. {{CN|date=March 2013}}

===France===
[[France]] introduced a clinical addendum to ICD-10 in 2005.  See also website of the ATIH.

===Germany===
[[Germany]]: ICD-10-GM (German Modification)

===Korea===
A Korean modification has existed since 2008.

===Netherlands===
The Dutch translation of ICD-10 is ICD10-nl, which was created by the WHO-FIC Netwerk in 1994.<ref>[http://www.rivm.nl/who-fic/ICD.htm WHO - FIC Homepage]</ref> There is an [http://class.who-fic.nl/browser.aspx?scheme=ICD10-nl.cla online dictionary].

===Sweden===
The current Swedish translation of ICD-10 was created in 1997. A clinical modification has added more detail and omits codes of the international version in the context of clinical use of ICD:

The codes F64.1 (Dual-role transvestism), F64.2 (Gender identity disorder of childhood), F65.0 (Fetishism), F65.1 (Fetishistic transvestism), F65.5 (Sadomasochism), F65.6 (Multiple disorders of sexual preference) are not used in Sweden since 1 January 2009 according to a decision by the present Director General of The National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden. The code O60.0 is not used in Sweden. Since 1 January 2009 the Swedish extension codes to O47 are recommended for use, instead of O60.0.

===Thailand===
A Thai modifications exists since 2007.

Now Ministry of Public Health have **ICD 10 TM**

===United States===
The deadline for the United States to begin using Clinical Modification [[ICD-10 Clinical Modification|ICD-10-CM]] for diagnosis coding and Procedure Coding System [[ICD-10 Procedure Coding System|ICD-10-PCS]] for inpatient hospital procedure coding is currently October 1, 2014.<ref>[http://www.modernhealthcare.com/Assets/pdf/CH81530824.PDF CMS Final Rule] [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]].  Retrieved 24 August 2012.</ref> The deadline was previously October 1, 2013.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm "International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)"].

In January 2009, the date was pushed back by two years, to October 1, 2013 rather than a prior proposal of October 1, 2011.<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2009/01/15/feds-delay-icd-10-for-two-years/ "Feds Delay ICD-10 for Two Years"]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. January 15, 2009.</ref>

Even though the deadline for ICD-10 has been pushed back repeatedly, CMS recommends that medical practices take several years to prepare for implementation of the new code set.<ref>[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ProviderResources.html "CMS.gov/ICD-10/Provider Resources"] accessed Aug 1, 2012.</ref> The basic structure of the ICD-10 code is the following: Characters 1-3 (the category of disease); 4 (etiology of disease); 5 (body part affected), 6 (severity of illness) and 7 (placeholder for extension of the code to increase specificity) .<ref>[http://www.jiteshchawla.org/1_11_ICD-10.html "AHIMA ICD-10 CM Primer"].</ref> Not only must new software be installed and tested, but medical practices must provide training for physicians, staff members, and administrators. They will also need to develop new practice policies and guidelines, and update paperwork and forms. Practices should also create crosswalks that will convert their most frequently used ICD-9 codes to the ICD-10 equivalents.

Although the undertaking can seem overwhelming, especially to small practices,<ref>[http://www.insidepatientfinance.com/revenue-cycle-news/managing-icd-10-conversions-for-smaller-healthcare-providers/ "Managing ICD-10 Conversions for Smaller Healthcare Providers"]  insidePatientFinance.com, Nov. 13, 2012.</ref> technology can be a big help. Practices should check with their EHR vendors to make sure they understand the data storage requirements for the new code set; seek online training available through association websites and software-based instruction; and invest in additional technology, such as patient kiosks, to boost productivity.<ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/icd-10/content/article/1462168/2075228 "How Your Medical Practice Can Avoid ICD-10 Pitfalls"] Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, June 2012.</ref>

===Language versions===
Language versions should not be confused with clinical versions.  ICD has been translated into 42 languages.
