'''Large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype''' (LCLC-RP) is a rare [[histological]] form of [[lung cancer]], currently classified as a variant of [[large-cell lung carcinoma|large cell lung carcinoma]] (LCLC). In order for a LCLC to be subclassified as the [[wikt:rhabdoid|rhabdoid]] [[phenotype]] variant, at least 10% of the [[malignant]] tumor cells must contain distinctive structures composed of tangled [[intermediate filaments]] that displace the cell [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] outward toward the [[cell membrane]].<ref name='RubenchikDardick'>{{cite journal |author=Rubenchik I, Dardick I, Auger M |title=Cytopathology and ultrastructure of primary rhabdoid tumor of lung |journal=Ultrastruct Pathol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=355–60 |year=1996 |pmid=8837343 |doi=10.3109/01913129609016337 }}</ref><ref name='who2004'/> The whorled [[eosinophilic]] inclusions in LCLC-RP cells give it a microscopic resemblance to [[malignant]] cells found in [[rhabdomyosarcoma]] (RMS), a rare [[neoplasm]] arising from transformed [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[muscle]].<ref name='BeckwithPalmer'>{{cite journal |author=Beckwith JB, Palmer NF |title=Histopathology and prognosis of Wilms tumors: results from the First National Wilms' Tumor Study |journal=Cancer |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=1937–48 |year=1978 |month=May |pmid=206343 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(197805)41:5<1937::AID-CNCR2820410538>3.0.CO;2-U }}</ref> Despite their microscopic similarities, LCLC-RP is not associated with rhabdomyosarcoma. 

Athough rhabdoid variants of LCLC are sometimes referred to as "rhabdoid carcinomas", this particular term should be reserved for examples of "pure" rhabdoid neoplasms (i.e. those that do not contain cells containing other histological variants)

==Differential Diagnosis==
The differential diagnosis of LCLC-RP includes secondary metastatic lesions, melignant [[melanoma]] of the lung with rhabdoid [[phenotype]], mucinous adenocarcinomas (particularly those featuring signet-ring cells), [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], epitheloid angiosarcoma, [[pleural]] mesothelioma, and [[plasmacytoma]].<ref name="SainiKumar"/><ref name='CavazzaColby'/><ref name="KanekoHonda"/><ref name='AttemsLintner'>{{cite journal |author=Attems JH, Lintner F |title=Pseudomesotheliomatous adenocarcinoma of the lung with rhabdoid features |journal=Pathol.

==Imaging==
On radiological imaging, most cases of LCLC-RP are single "coin lesions" or discrete masses, but cases presenting as multiple nodules throughout the lung have also been noted.<ref name='Yilmazbayhan'>{{cite journal |author=Yilmazbayhan D, Ates LE, Dilege S, Gulluoglu M, Tanju S, Kalayci G |title=Pulmonary large cell carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype |journal=Ann Diagn Pathol |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=223–6 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16084457 |doi=10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2005.04.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1092-9134(05)00052-3}}</ref> Cases with inhomogeneous-appearing consolidation on CT have been reported, as well as aerogenous, lepidic-type spread.<ref name='Jelena'>{{cite journal |author=Krčedinac Jelena, Panjković Milana, Božanić Snežana, Samardžija Golub, Stojanović Miloš |title=Large cell carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype: case report |journal=Arch Oncol |volume=19 |issue=1–2 |pages=34–6 |year=2011 |doi=10.2298/AOO1102034K |url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0354-73101102034K}}</ref> Some large, centrally located LCLC-RP have been noted to show signs of gross necrosis and cavitation on imaging studies,<ref name='HiroshimaShibuya'>{{cite journal |author=Hiroshima K, Shibuya K, Shimamura F, ''et al.'' |title=Pulmonary large cell carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype |journal=Ultrastruct Pathol |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=55–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12554537 |doi=10.1080/01913120309949 }}</ref> as well as being associated with the presence of large bullae.<ref name='Jelena'/>

==Immunohistochemistry==
Results of [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) staining in rhabdoid lung cancers tends to reflect the multiphasic nature of these tumors. Typically, markers expressed in LCLC-RP include those seen in "generic" NSCLC's, such as [[epithelial membrane antigen]] (EMA, 61%), various cytokeratins (CK's, 80%), and markers associated with the underlying "parent" pulmonary carcinoma. Expression of immunomarkers in the rhabdoid cells, however, have often been noted to be weaker and more diffuse than those in the more differentiated tumor cells.<ref name="SainiKumar"/><ref name="KanekoHonda"/> They also more frequently express "non-carcinomatous" markers typically associated with "dedifferentiated" neoplasms. Interestingly, expression of [[NK2 homeobox 1|thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)]], a commonly used marker for primary lung cancers, appears to be less frequent in rhabdoid carcinomas than in most other histotypes of pulmonary cancers.<ref name='TamboliToprani'>{{cite journal |author=Tamboli P, Toprani TH, Amin MB, ''et al.'' |title=Carcinoma of lung with rhabdoid features |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=8–13 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14745719 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0046817703005100 |doi=10.1016/j.humpath.2003.07.019}}</ref>

Vimentin, an intermediate filament protein usually found in [[sarcoma]], is ubiquitously (nearly 100%) expressed diffusely throughout the [[cytoplasm]] of the rhabdoid cells, and is often intermingled with CK's in their whorled inclusions. Some studied have reported that neuroendocrine-related markers (i.e. [[Enolase 2|neuron-specific enolase (NSE)]], [[neural cell adhesion molecule]] (NCAM), [[chromogranin A]] (CgA), [[synaptophysin]]), are also quite frequently expressed in a significant proportion of rhabdoid cells.<ref name="SainiKumar"/><ref name="ShimazakiAida"/><ref name="KanekoHonda"/>

==Histogenesis and genetics==
The histogenesis of most lung cancers is not well understood. Carcinomas of the lung are thought to arise from the uncontrolled growth of mutated, transformed, multipotent "cancer stem cells" with epithelial characteristics or lineage. When viewed under a light microscope, the transformed cancer cells in LCLC are undifferentiated, lacking specific cytological and tissue architectural characteristics of other types, subtypes, and variants of lung cancer.<ref name="who2004"/> Election microscopic studies, however, have shown that many LCLC do have ultrastructural characteristics of other tumor types (i.e. adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma).,<ref name='PardoMartinez'>{{cite journal |author=Pardo J, Martinez-Peñuela AM, Sola JJ, ''et al.'' |title=Large cell carcinoma of the lung: an endangered species? |journal=Appl.

Some evidence suggests that cells with the rhabdoid phenotype result from mutations occurring in some of the cells descending from the "parent" tumor, leading to the "emergence" of distinct populations of characteristic cells with the rhabdoid phenotype within the parent neoplasm, often in the peripheral part of the tumor.<ref name="AttemsLintner"/><ref name="HiroshimaShibuya"/><ref name='MiyagiTsuhako'/> Missense mutations occurring in the [[Keratin 8|cytokeratin 8 (CK-8)]] gene (''RTK 8'')<ref name='KraussFranke'>{{cite journal |author=Krauss S, Franke WW |title=Organization and sequence of the human gene encoding cytokeratin 8 |journal=Gene |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=241–9 |year=1990 |month=February |pmid=1691124 |doi=10.1016/0378-1119(90)90285-Y }}</ref> at specific codons affects the way the protein products of this gene assume their normal two- and three-dimensional shapes, and may well affect the way the mutant proteins undergo assembly into filamentous structures within the cytoplasm.

It seems likely that mutations and post-tranlational modifications affecting cytokeratin 8, [[Keratin 18|cytokeratin 18]], and vimentin protofilaments are intimately involved in the genesis of the characteristic inclusions and, therefore, of the rhabdoid phenotype.

==Treatment==
Because LCLC-RP is so rare, no clinical trials have ever been conducted that specifically address treatment of this lung cancer variant. Because LCLC-RP is considered a form of [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small cell lung carcinoma]] (NSCLC), most physicians adhere to published NSCLC treatment guidelines in rhabdoid carcinoma cases. When possible, radical surgical resection with curative intent is the primary treatment of choice in early stage NSCLC's, and can be administered with or without adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, depending on the disease stage and performance status of the individual patient.<ref name='NCCN'>{{cite web |title=NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology |id=v.2.2010 |publisher=National Comprehensive Cancer Network |url=http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/nscl.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

In numerous clinical trials conducted in NSCLC, several different platinum-based chemotherapy regimens have been shown to be more-or-less equally effective.<ref name="NCCN"/> LCLC's, as a subtype of NSCLC, have traditionally been included in many of these clinical trials, and have been treated like other NSCLC's. More recent trials, however, have shown that some newer agents may have particular effectiveness in prolonging survival of LCLC patients.<ref name="RossiMarchioni"/><ref name='Vincent'/> [[Pemetrexed]], in particular, has shown significant reduction in the hazard ratio for death when used in patients with LCLC.<ref name='ZinnerNovello'>{{cite journal |author=Zinner RG, Novello S, Peng G, Herbst R, Obasaju C, Scagliotti G |title=Comparison of patient outcomes according to histology among pemetrexed-treated patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer in two phase II trials |journal=Clin Lung Cancer |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=126–31 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20199979 |doi=10.3816/CLC.2010.n.017 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1525-7304(11)70009-2}}</ref> Taxane-based ([[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]]) chemotherapy was shown to induce a complete and sustained response in a liver metastasis in a case of LCC-RP.

A recent study reported a case wherein 2 courses of adjuvant therapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel, followed by oral gefitinib, were used after complete resection. The patient had had no recurrence 34 months later.<ref name="HasegawaSuda"/>

As large-volume LCLC-RP may show significant central necrosis and cavitation, prudence dictates that oncologists use extreme caution if contemplating the therapeutic use of [[bevacizumab]], other anti-VEGF compounds, or anti-angiogenesis agents in general, which have been associated with a greatly increased risk of severe hemorrhage and [[hemoptysis]] that may be quickly fatal in cavatated pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas. Similar elevated risks have also been noted in tumors located near, or containing, large blood vessels.,<ref name='HiroshimaShibuya'/>

==Prognosis==
LCLC-RP are considered to be especially aggressive tumors with a dismal prognosis.<ref name="RossiMarchioni"/><ref name="TamboliToprani"/><ref name='WickRitter'/> Many published cases have shown short survival times after diagnosis.<ref name="ShimazakiAida"/><ref name='ChettyBhana'>{{cite journal |author=Chetty R, Bhana B, Batitang S, Govender D |title=Lung carcinomas composed of rhabdoid cells |journal=Eur J Surg Oncol |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=432–4 |year=1997 |month=October |pmid=9393573 |doi=10.1016/S0748-7983(97)93725-2 }}</ref> Some studies suggest that, as the proportion of rhabdoid cells in the tumor increases, the prognosis tends to worsen,<ref name="ShimazakiAida"/> although this is most pronounced when the proportion of rhabdoid cells exceeds 5%.<ref name="ShimazakiAida"/> With regard to "parent" neoplasms other than LCLC, adenocarcinomas with rhabdoid features have been reported to have worse prognoses than adenocarcinomas without rhabdoid features,<ref name='SheikhAlKhatti'>{{cite journal |author=Sheikh SS, Al-Khatti AA, Amr SS |title=Metachronus malignant rhabdoid tumor of the ileum and adenocarcinoma of lung: a unique case report |journal=Ann Diagn Pathol |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=57–61 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18164418 |doi=10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2006.06.007 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1092-9134(06)00079-7}}</ref> although an "adenocarcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype" tumor variant has not been specifically recognized as a distinct entity under the WHO-2004 classification system.<ref name="who2004"/>

Interestingly, there are case reports of rhabdoid carcinomas recurring after unusually long periods, which is unusual for a fast growing, aggressive tumor type. One report described a very early stage patient whose tumor recurred 6 years after initial treatment.<ref name="HiroshimaShibuya"/> Although rapidly progressive, fulminant courses seem to be the rule in this entity, long term survival has also been noted, even post-metastectomy in late stage, distant metastatic disease.<ref name="KanekoHonda"/>

==Epidemiology==
Although reliable and comprehensive incidence statistics are nonexistent, LCLC-RP is a rare tumor, with only a few hundred cases described in the scientific literature to date.<ref name="SainiKumar"/><ref name='PardoMartinez'/> LCLC's made up about 10% of lung cancers in most historical series,<ref name="who2004"/><ref name='TravisTravis'/><ref name='IyodaHiroshima'>{{cite journal |author=Iyoda A, Hiroshima K, Toyozaki T, Haga Y, Fujisawa T, Ohwada H |title=Clinical characterization of pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine morphology |journal=Cancer |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1992–2000 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11391577 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(20010601)91:11<1992::AID-CNCR1224>3.0.CO;2-5 }}</ref><ref name='TakeiAsamura'>{{cite journal |author=Takei H, Asamura H, Maeshima A, ''et al.'' |title=Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung: a clinicopathologic study of eighty-seven cases |journal=J.

In another highly selected series of large-cell lung carcinoma cases, only 4 of 45 tumors (9%) were diagnosed as the rhabdoid phenotype using the 10% criterion, but another 10 (22%) had at least some rhabdoid cell formation.<ref name="ShimazakiAida"/> It appears likely, therefore, that LCLC-RP probably comprises between 0.1% and 1.0% of all lung malignancies.

Similar to nearly all variants of lung carcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype appears to be highly related to tobacco smoking. It also appears to be significantly more common in males than in females.<ref name="TamboliToprani"/>

==Metastasis==
LCLC-RP is generally considered to be an especially aggressive malignancy that metastasizes widely early on in its clinical course. Similar to most other forms of lung carcinoma, LCLC-RP may spread ("metastasize") in three major ways — by local extension and infiltration into surrounding tissues, by lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes, and through the bloodstream (hematogeneous metastasis) to distant organs and tissues such as the liver, brain, and skeleton.

It has been reported recently<ref name='Jelena'/> that LCLC-RP can metastasize locally within the airways ("aerogeneous spread"), an uncommon mechanism of extension wherein tumor cells migrate along the lung walls and [[septa]], but do not destroy air sacs. Previously, this type of metastatic behavior had not been seen in this particular tumor, being traditionally associated almost exclusively with the "pneumonic" form of [[pulmonary]] [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]].

==Future research==
As the rhabdoid phenotype may exclusively be associated with certain missense mutations in the ''CK-8'' gene (or, possibly, the [[vimentin]] gene — see above), it may prove possible to develop specific monoclonal antibodies against certain peptides in these aberrant gene products that may target only rhabdoid cells with these specific mutations. Recent reports suggest that antibodies may be easier to get into the interior of cells than previously thought.
