'''Trevena Inc''' is a privately held [[biopharmaceutical]] company, headquartered in King of Prussia, PA, specializing in the discovery and development of targeted therapeutics for [[G protein coupled receptors]]. Trevena was founded with technology licensed from [[Duke University]], which originated in the labs of company founders [[Robert Lefkowitz]] and Howard Rockman.  Trevena's innovative approach to drug discovery is based on utilizing ligand bias, or [[functional selectivity]], at GPCR targets to produce drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side effect profiles.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=416–22 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2007.06.006 |title=Β-Arrestin-biased ligands at seven-transmembrane receptors |year=2007 |last1=Violin |first1=Jonathan D. |last2=Lefkowitz |first2=Robert J. |journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume=28 |issue=8 |pmid=17644195}}</ref> In 2008, the company raised $25 Million in a Series A financing round led by [[Alta Partners]], [[Polaris Ventures]], [[New Enterprise Associates]], Healthcare Ventures, and Yasuda Economic Development Corporation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Trevena Inc Announces $24 Million Series A Financing |url=http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?NewsEntityId=88213 |work=BioSpace.com |date=2008-03-05 }}</ref>  Trevena was named one of the top 15 US startups of 2008 by Business Week.<ref>{{cite news |title=Most Successful U.S. Startups 2008. |url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/08/12/1217_hottest_startups/index.htm |work=Business Week |date=2008-12-31 }}</ref> The company raised an additional $35 million USD in a B round of venture financing in the summer of 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Trevena lands $35M round to fund its first PhII |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/trevena-lands-35m-round-fund-its-first-phii/2010-07-14 |work=Fierce Biotech |date=2010-07-14 }}</ref>
