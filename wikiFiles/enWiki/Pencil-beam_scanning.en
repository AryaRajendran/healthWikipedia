Pencil beam scans (Medical physics)

==Ionizing radiation==

Ionizing radiation [[photon]]s or [[x-ray]]s ([[IMRT]]) use pencil beam scanning to precisely target a tumor. Bone scan densitometry uses a fan scan system that replaces a pencil beam system.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=8220974 | volume=66 | issue=790 | title=Dual X-ray absorptiometry: a comparison between fan beam and pencil beam scans | year=1993 | month=October | author=Blake GM, Parker JC, Buxton FM, Fogelman I | journal=Br J Radiol | pages=902â€“6}}</ref>  [[Radiation treatment planning]] has pencil beam scanning as one of its modalities.  [[mean free path]] is involved in IMRT planning. Also used in [[Monte Carlo method for photon transport]]. Another three sources are: [[Hybrid theory for photon transport in tissue]] which is a combination of [[Diffusion theory]] and the [[Monte Carlo method]] all using, in part, pencil beam scanning.  Photon pencil beam scans are defined as crossing of two beams to a fine point.

==Charged particles==
 
Several [[charged particle]]s devices used with [[Proton therapy]] cancer centers use pencil beam scanning.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=pWDQnxd-r1UC&pg=PA521#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> The newer proton therapy machines use a pencil beam scanning technology.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf10/K100766.pdf page4</ref>
This technique is also called spot scanning.<ref>http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/news-backgrounders/03-30-09-advances-in-proton-therapy-pencil-beam-technology-reach-patient-care.html</ref> The [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] was the developer of spot beam.<ref>http://radmed.web.psi.ch/asm/gantry/scan/n_scan.html</ref>
