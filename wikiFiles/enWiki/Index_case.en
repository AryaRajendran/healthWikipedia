The '''index case''' or '''primary case''' is the initial [[patient]] in the [[population]] of an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/diseases/other/glossary/act1-gloss3.htm |title=Diseases - Activity 1 - Glossary, page 3 of 5 |publisher=science.education.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=index%20case |title=WordNet Search - 3.0 |publisher=Princeton University, wordnetweb.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> The index case may indicate the source of the [[disease]], the possible spread, and which reservoir holds the disease in between [[outbreak]]s.

== Gaëtan Dugas case ("Patient Zero") ==
{{main|Gaëtan Dugas}}

In the early years of the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]], there was [[controversy]] about a so-called “patient zero” {{Why|date=April 2013}}, who was the basis of a complex transmission scenario compiled by [[William Darrow|Dr. William Darrow]] and colleagues at the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).<ref name=avert /> This epidemiological study showed how “patient zero” had infected multiple partners with [[HIV]], and they, in turn, transmitted it to others and rapidly spread the [[virus]] to locations all over the world (Auerbach et al., 1984). The CDC identified [[Gaëtan Dugas]] as the first person to bring HIV from Africa to the [[United States]] and to introduce it to [[gay bathhouse]]s. <ref>Pence, G. E. (2008). Preventing the Global Spread of AIDS. In Medical Ethics Accounts of the Cases That Shaped and Define Medical Ethics (p. 331). New York, USA, McGraw-Hill.</ref> 

Journalist [[Randy Shilts]] subsequently wrote about Patient Zero {{Why|date=April 2013}}, based on Darrow's findings,<ref name=avert></ref> in his 1987 book ''[[And the Band Played On]]'', which identified Patient Zero as Gaëtan Dugas.<ref>[http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biod3/duga1.html Matt & Andrej Koymasky - Famous GLTB - Gaëtan Dugas]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> Dugas was a flight attendant who was sexually promiscuous in several North American cities, according to Shilts' book. He was vilified for several years as a "mass spreader" of HIV, and seen as the original source of the HIV epidemic among [[homosexual]] men.<ref name=avert>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/origin-aids-hiv.htm|title=The Origin of HIV and the First Cases of AIDS|publisher=AVERT, www.avert.org|accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref> Four years later, Darrow repudiated the study's methodology and how Shilts had represented its conclusions.<ref name=avert />

A 2007 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the [[USA]] by Michael Worobey and Dr. Arthur Pitchenik claimed that, based on the results of genetic analysis, current North American strains of HIV probably moved from [[Africa]] to [[Haiti]] and then entered the United States around 1969,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7068574.stm|work=BBC News|title=Key HIV strain 'came from Haiti'|date=2007-10-30|accessdate=2010-05-05|first=Neil|last=Bowdler}}</ref> probably through a single [[immigrant]].  However, a [[Robert Rayford]] died in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint-Louis]], [[Missouri]], of complications from AIDS in 1969, and most likely became infected in the [[1950s]], so there were prior carriers of HIV strains in North America. 

The phrase "patient zero" is now used in the media to refer to the index case for infectious disease outbreaks, as well as for computer virus outbreaks, and, more broadly, as the source of ideas or actions that have far-reaching consequences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/29/earlyshow/main4976805.shtml|work=CBS News|title=Have Doctors Found Swine "Patient Zero?"|date=2009-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.techworld.com/security/113086/researchers-trawl-for-confickers-patient-zero/|title=Researchers trawl for Conficker's 'Patient Zero' - Techworld.com|publisher=news.techworld.com|accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order/patient-zero-276048/|title=Patient Zero|publisher=TV.com|date=2006-03-20|accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref><ref>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/25/witty_worm_traced/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/437txvzt.asp?pg=2|title=That Man in the White House|publisher=The Weekly Standard|date=28 November 2003|accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref>

== In the media, in fiction ==

In season 10, [[Radiolab]] did an hour-long segment on “patients zero”.

=== In fiction ===

The film [[Outbreak (film)|''Outbreak'']] focuses around the search for a “patient zero” of an epidemic.
