A '''hydrocele testis''' is an accumulation of clear fluid in the [[tunica vaginalis]], the most internal of membranes containing a [[testicle]]. A primary hydrocele causes a painless enlargement in the scrotum on the affected side and is thought to be due to the defective absorption of fluid secreted between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis (investing membrane). A secondary hydrocele is secondary to either inflammation or a neoplasm in the testis.

A [[hydrocele]] usually occurs on one side, but can also affect both sides. The accumulation can be a marker of [[physical trauma]], [[infection]] or [[tumor]], but the cause is generally unknown.

==Cause==

During [[embryogenesis]], the [[testis]] descends through the [[inguinal canal]], drawing a diverticulum of [[peritoneum]] into the [[scrotum]] as it descends. This peritoneal tissue is known as the [[processus vaginalis]]. Normally, the communication between the processus vaginalis and the peritoneum is obliterated, and the [[tunica vaginalis]] is the tissue that remains overlying the testis and the [[epididymis]]. Congenital hydrocele results when the processus vaginalis remains patent, allowing fluid from the peritoneum to accumulate in the scrotum.

==Symptoms==

A hydrocele feels like a small fluid-filled balloon inside the [[scrotum]]. It is smooth, and is mainly in front of the testis. Hydroceles vary greatly in size. Hydroceles are normally painless and harmless. Large hydroceles cause discomfort because of their size. As the fluid of a hydrocele is transparent, light shone through a hydrocelic region will be visible from the other side. This phenomenon is called transillumination.

Symptoms of a hydrocele can easily be distinguished from [[testicular cancer]], as a hydrocele is soft and fluidy, where a testicular cancer feels hard and rough.

Through diagnostic [[ultrasound]] the accumulation of fluids can be diagnosed correctly.

==Treatment==

The accumulation should generally be removed surgically. The procedure is called hydrocelectomy. There are two surgical techniques available for hydrocelectomy.

'''Hydrocelectomy with Excision of the Hydrocele Sac:
'''
Incision of the hydrocele sac after complete mobilization of the hydrocele. Partial resection of the hydrocele sac, leaving a margin of 1–2 cm. Care is taken not to injure testicular vessels, epididymis or ductus deferens. The edge of the hydrocele sac is oversewn for haemostasis (von Bergmann's technique) or the edges are sewn together behind the spermatic cord (Winkelmann's or Jaboulay's technique). Hydrocele surgery with excision of the hydrocele sas is useful for large or thick-walled hydroceles and multilocular hydroceles.

'''Hydrocele Surgery with Plication of the Hydrocele Sac:'''

The hydrocele is opened with a small skin incision without further preparation. The hydrocele sac is reduced (plicated) by suture Hydrocele surgery: Lord's technique. The plication technique is suitable for medium-sized and thin-walled hydroceles. The advantage of the plication technique is the minimized dissection with a reduced complication rate.<ref>Ku u.a. 2001 KU, J. H. ; KIM, M. E. ; LEE, N. K. ; PARK, Y. H.:The excisional, plication and internal drainage techniques: a comparison of the results for idiopathic hydrocele.In: BJU Int 87 (2001), Nr. 1, S. 82–4 </ref> 

If the hydrocele is not surgically removed, it may continue to grow. The hydrocele fluid can be aspirated, the procedure is less invasive but recurrence rates are high.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fracchia | first1 = JA | last2 = Armenakas | first2 = NA | last3 = Kohan | first3 = AD | title = Cost-effective hydrocele ablation | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 159 | issue = 3 | pages = 864–7 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9474170 | doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(01)63755-8}}</ref>  Sclerotherapy, the injection of a solution following aspiration of the hydrocele fluid may increase success rates.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beiko | first1 = DT | last2 = Kim | first2 = D | last3 = Morales | first3 = A | title = Aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocelectomy for treatment of hydroceles | journal = Urology | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 708–12 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12670550 | doi=10.1016/S0090-4295(02)02430-5}}</ref> In many patients, the procedure of [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspiration]] and [[sclerotherapy]] is repeated as the hydrocele recurs.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000052680.03705.40 | last1 = Shan | first1 = CJ | last2 = Lucon | first2 = AM | last3 = Arap | first3 = S. | year = 2003 | title = A Comparative study of sclerotherapy with phenol and surgical treatment for hydrocele | url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 169 | issue = 3| pages = 1056–9 | pmid = 12576845 }}</ref>

==Fertility==

A hydrocele testis is not generally thought to affect fertility. However, it may be indicative of other factors that may affect fertility.
