The '''great saphenous vein (GSV)''', also '''long saphenous vein''', is the large, subcutaneous, [[superficial vein]] of the [[leg]] and [[thigh]].  

The terms "safaina" (Greek, meaning "manifest," "to be clearly seen") and "el safin" (Arabic, meaning "hidden/concealed") have both been claimed as the origin for the word "saphenous."<ref name="pmid11802151">{{cite journal |doi=10.1067/mva.2002.118826 |title=The saphenous vein: Derivation of its name and its relevant anatomy |year=2002 |last1=Caggiati |first1=Alberto |last2=Bergan |first2=John J. |journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery |volume=35 |pages=172–5 |pmid=11802151 |issue=1}}</ref>

==Path==
The GSV originates from where the dorsal vein of the [[first digit]] (the large toe) merges with the [[dorsal venous arch of the foot]].  

After passing anterior to the [[medial malleolus]] (where it often can be visualized and [[Palpation|palpated]]), it runs up the [[medial]] side of the leg. 

At the knee, it runs over the posterior border of the [[medial epicondyle of the femur|medial epicondyle]] of the [[femur]] bone. 

The great saphenous vein then courses medially to lie on the anterior surface of the thigh before entering an opening in the [[fascia lata]] called the [[saphenous opening]]. 

It forms an arch, the saphenous arch, to join the [[common femoral vein]] in the region of the [[femoral triangle]] at the sapheno-femoral junction.

==Tributaries==
At the ankle it receives branches from the sole of the foot through the [[medial marginal vein]]; in the lower leg it anastomoses freely with the [[small saphenous vein]], communicates by perforator veins (Cockett perforators) with the [[anterior tibial vein|anterior]] and [[Posterior tibial vein|posterior tibial]] veins and receives many cutaneous veins; near the knee it comunicates with the femoral vein by the Boyd perforator, in the thigh it communicates with the [[femoral vein]] by perforator veins (Dodd perforator) and receives numerous tributaries; those from the medial and posterior parts of the [[thigh]] frequently unite to form a large ''accessory saphenous vein'' which joins the main vein near the sapheno-femoral junction.<ref name="Franceschi & Zamboni">{{cite book|title=Principles of Venous Hemodynamics|author=Franceschi, C.|coauthor=Zamboni, P.|pages=12–13|publisher=Nova biomedical Books|year=2009|isbn=978-60692-485-3}}</ref>

Near the [[saphenous opening|fossa ovalis]] it is joined by the [[superficial epigastric vein|superficial epigastric]], [[superficial iliac circumflex vein|superficial iliac circumflex]], and [[External pudendal vein|superficial external pudendal]] veins. 

The [[thoracoepigastric vein]] runs along the lateral aspect of the trunk between the [[superficial epigastric vein]] below and the [[lateral thoracic vein]] above and establishes an important communication between the [[femoral vein]] and the [[axillary vein]] .

==Use in cardiovascular procedures==
The vein is often removed by [[vascular surgeon]]s and used for [[autotransplantation]] in [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass operation]]s, when arterial grafts are not available or many grafts are required, such as in a [[triple bypass]] or [[quadruple bypass]].

The great saphenous vein is the conduit of choice for [[vascular surgeon]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11892-005-0063-7 |title=Peripheral arterial disease: Clinical assessment and indications for revascularization in the patient with diabetes |year=2005 |last1=Muhs |first1=Bart E. |last2=Gagne |first2=Paul |last3=Sheehan |first3=Peter |journal=Current Diabetes Reports |volume=5 |pages=24–9 |pmid=15663913 |issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001487 |title=Graft type for femoro-popliteal bypass surgery |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=1999 |last1=Mamode |first1=Nizam |last2=Scott |first2=Roy N |editor1-last=Mamode |editor1-first=Nizam |pmid=10796649 |issue=2 |pages=CD001487}}</ref> when available, for doing peripheral arterial bypass operations [ see [[vascular bypass]] ] because it has superior long-term patency compared to synthetic grafts ([[PTFE]], [[PETE]] (Dacron)), [[human umbilical vein graft]]s or biosynthetic grafts [Omniflow].  Often, it is used ''[[in situ]]'' (in place), after tying off smaller tributaries and stripping the [[valves]] with a device called [[LeMaitre's valvulotome]].

The [[saphenous nerve]] is a branch of the [[femoral nerve]] that runs with the great saphenous vein and is often damaged in surgeries that make use of the similarly named vein.

==Use in emergency medicine==
When emergency resuscitation with fluids is necessary, and standard [[intravenous]] access cannot be achieved due to venous collapse, [[Venous cutdown|saphenous vein cutdown]] may be necessary.

==Pathology of the saphenous vein==
[[Pathology]] of the great saphenous vein is relatively common, but in isolation typically not life threatening.<ref name=feied>Feied C, Handler JA. Thrombophlebitis, Superficial. eMedicine.com. Available at: [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic582.htm http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic582.htm]. Accessed on: December 18, 2006.

* [[Varicose vein]]s: The great saphenous vein, like other [[superficial vein]]s, can develop varices, which are generally considered to be unsightly. Various treatment options exist for treating varicose veins. Varicose veins are not life threatening.

* [[Thrombophlebitis]]: The great saphenous vein can [[thrombosis|thrombose]]. This type of [[phlebitis]] of the great saphenous vein usually is not life threatening in isolation; however, if the blood clot is located near the sapheno-femoral junction or near a perforator vein a clot fragment can migrate to the deep venous system and to the pulmonary circulation. Also it can be associated with, or progress to a [[deep vein thrombosis]] which must be treated promptly. So a saphenous vein thrombosis must be always investigated by [[ultrasonography]] to detect these complications.<ref name=feied/>
