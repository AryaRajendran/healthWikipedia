'''Human nutrition''' is the provision to obtain the materials necessary to support [[life]]. In general, people can survive for two to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat and muscle mass. Survival without water is usually limited to three or four days. Lack of food remains a serious problem, with about 36 million people dying every year from causes directly or indirectly related to hunger.<ref>[[United Nations]] Information Service. [http://www.fao.org/righttofood/kc/downloads/vl/docs/Rtf%20hearing%2031%2003%202004.doc “Independent Expert On Effects Of Structural Adjustment, Special Rapporteur On Right To Food Present Reports: Commission Continues General Debate On Economic, Social And Cultural Rights”].

== Overview ==
Nutritional science investigates the [[metabolism|metabolic]] and physiological responses of the body to diet. With advances in the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[genetics]], the study of nutrition is increasingly concerned
with metabolism and [[metabolic pathway]]s: the sequences of biochemical steps through which substances in living things change from one form to another.

The [[human body]] contains [[chemical compounds]], such as [[water]], [[carbohydrate]]s (sugar, starch, and [[fiber]]), [[amino acids]] (in [[proteins]]), [[fatty acids]] (in [[lipids]]), and [[nucleic acids]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]). These compounds in turn consist of [[chemical element|elements]] such as [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[magnesium]], [[manganese]], and so on. All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations (e.g. [[hormones]], [[vitamins]], [[phospholipids]], [[hydroxyapatite]]), both in the [[human body]] and in the plant and animal organisms that humans eat.

The human body consists of elements and compounds ingested, digested, absorbed, and circulated through the [[blood]]stream to feed the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of the body. Except in the unborn fetus, the [[digestive system]] is the first system involved in obtaining nutrition. In a typical adult, about seven liters of digestive juices enter the digestive tract.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These break [[chemical bonds]] in ingested molecules, and modulate their [[Protein conformation|conformations]] and energy states. Though some molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged, digestive processes release them from the matrix of foods. Unabsorbed matter, along with some waste products of [[metabolism]]{{Examples|date=February 2013}}, is eliminated from the body in the [[feces]].

Studies of nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the [[chemical]] composition of the whole diet and of all material [[excreted]] and eliminated from the body (in [[urine]] and feces). Comparing the food to the waste can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized in the body. The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period, during which all food and waste must be analyzed. The number of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] involved in such [[experiment]]s is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving.

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Nutrient}}

There are seven major classes of nutrients: [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]].

These nutrient classes can be categorized as either [[macronutrients]] (needed in relatively large amounts) or [[micronutrients]] (needed in smaller quantities). The macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, proteins, and water. The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.

The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built),  [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital ''C'' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&nbsp;kJ approximately (4&nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&nbsp;kJ (9&nbsp;kcal) per gram,<ref name=Stryer>{{cite book | author = Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7167-4684-0 |page= 603 }}</ref> though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material, fiber (i.e., non-digestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental  components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]], some of which are [[essential amino acids|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when [[atrophy]] takes place, or during periods of starvation.

Other micronutrients include [[antioxidants]] and [[phytochemicals]] which are said to influence (or protect) some body systems. Their necessity is not as well established as in the case of, for instance, vitamins.

Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes, together with other substances. Some nutrients can be stored internally (e.g., the fat soluble vitamins), while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or, in extreme cases, too much of a required nutrient. For example, both salt and water (both absolutely required) will cause illness or even death in too large amounts.

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}

[[Image:starchy-foods..jpg|thumb|right|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of complex and simple carbohydrates]]

Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s, or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodles]], [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products.

Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Polysaccharides are often referred to as ''complex'' carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in blood glucose levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases which have become more frequent in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than formerly, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear, however.

Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-sugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients. However, the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient, starch, varies in its absorption. Gelatinized starch (starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water) is far more digestible than plain starch. And starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion. The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans. Additionally, up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty.

===Fat===
{{duplication|dupe = Animal nutrition#Fat|date=April 2013}}
{{Main|Fat|Nutrition#Fat}}

A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fats]] are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].

Many studies have shown that unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, are best in the human diet. Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next, while trans fats are to be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

====Essential fatty acids====
{{Main|Essential fatty acids}}

Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids – [[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids – seems also important for health, though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoids]] known as [[prostaglandins]], which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (LNA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. weakly [[inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g., pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins: one reason a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.

Omega-3 EPA prevents fat from being released from the wild, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward fat PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the fat [[desaturase|delta-5-desaturase]], which in turn is controlled by fat such as [[insulin]] (up-regulation) and [[glucagon]] (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of fat, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore the ratio of omega-3 versus fat has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and [[inflammation]], and [[mitosis]] (cell division).

Good sources of essential fatty acids include most vegetables, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], seeds, and marine oils.<ref name=Barker2002>{{Cite book | last = Barker | first =  Helen M. | year = 2002 | title = Nutrition and dietetics for health care | page = 17 | isbn = 0-443-07021-0 | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | location = Edinburgh | oclc = 48917971 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Fiber===
{{Main|Dietary fiber}}

Dietary fiber is a [[carbohydrate]] (or a polysaccharide) that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram.  But in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. There are two subcategories: insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of [[cellulose]], a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans who do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it nor do their digestive systems harbor sufficient quantities of the types microbes that can do so either.  Soluable dietary fiber comprises a variety of [[oligosaccharides]], [[waxes]], [[esters]], resistant starches and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce [[short-chain fatty acids]] which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content.

Whole grains, beans and other [[legumes]], fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} For mechanical  reasons it can help in alleviating both [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]]. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber especially stimulates [[peristalsis]] – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high [[viscosity]]; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Protein===
{{Main|Protein in nutrition}}

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enyzmes which catalyse chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which are characterized by containing nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance).  Amino acids are soluble in the digestive juices within the small intestine, where they are absorbed into the blood. Once absorbed they cannot be stored in the body, so they are either metabolised as required or excreted in the urine. 

For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other amino acids). Twenty two amino acids can be found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential, and therefore must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A ''complete'' protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an ''incomplete'' protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.

It is a common misconception that a [[vegetarian]] diet will be insufficient in essential proteins; both vegetarians and [[vegans]] of any age and gender, with a healthy diet, can flourish throughout all stages of life, although the latter group typically need to pay more attention to their nutrition than the former.

[[Image:Rice and beans, Hotel in Itatiaia.jpeg|thumb|[[Rice and beans]] supply amino acids as protein sources]]
Sources of dietary protein include [[meat]]s, [[tofu]] and other [[soy]]-products, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[grain]]s, [[legume]]s, and [[dairy product]]s such as [[milk]] and [[cheese]]. A few amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]; this is done in quantity only during starvation.

===Minerals===
{{Main|Dietary mineral}}

Dietary minerals are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned – including several [[metals]], which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].

A [[low sodium diet]] is beneficial for people with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. A [[Cochrane review]] published in 2008 concluded that a long term (more than 4 weeks) low sodium diet in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] has a useful effect to reduce blood pressure, both in people with [[hypertension]] and in people with normal blood pressure.<ref name=cochrane2008>He FJ, MacGregor GA. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004937/frame.html Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure.] Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2004, Issue 1. Art.

A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of [[sodium]], and it also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also "rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein".<ref name="dashguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf|title=Your Guide To Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref>

====Essential dietary minerals====
Many elements are essential in relative quantity; they are usually  called "bulk minerals" requiring daily milligram quantities. Some are structural, but many play a role as [[electrolyte]]s.<ref>{{cite book | author=Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition=3rd | publisher=Worth Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 |  isbn=1-57259-153-6}}</ref> Elements with recommended dietary allowance ([[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]]) greater than 200&nbsp;mg/day are, in alphabetical order (with informal or folk-medicine perspectives in parentheses):
* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally (for muscle and digestive system health, bones, some forms neutralize acidity, may help clear toxins, and provide signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions). 99% of calcium is found in bones and teeth. Food sources include, milk products, sardines, clams, oysters, kale, turnip greens, mustard greens, and tofu.<ref name="mahan" />
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte; see sodium, below
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity). Approximately 50% is in bone, the remaining 50% is almost all inside body cells, with only about 1% located in extracellular fluid. Food sources include Whole-grain cereals, tofu nuts, meat, milk, green vegetables, legumes, and chocolate.<ref name="mahan">{{cite book | title= Krausw's Food and the Nutrition Care Process |edition=13th edition  publisher=Elsevier |location=St. Louis | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4377-2233-8 | author= L. Kathleen Mahan, Janice L. Raymond, Sylvia Escott-Stump}}</ref>
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing<ref>{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=0-444-89307-5}}</ref> Approximately 80% is found in inorganic portion of bones and teeth. Phosphorus is a component of every cell, as well as important metabolites, including DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids. Also important in pH regulation. Food sources include cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, and many others.<ref name="mahan" />
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health). With sodium, potassium is involved in maintaining normal water balance, osmotic equilibrium, and acid-base balance. In addition to calcium, it is important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity. Food sources include fruits, vegetables, fresh meat, and dairy products.<ref name="mahan" />
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte; not generally found in dietary supplements, despite being needed in large quantities, because the ion is very common in food: typically as [[sodium chloride]], or common salt

====Trace minerals====
Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].<ref name=lipp>{{cite book | author=Lippard, S. J. and Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=0-935702-73-3}}</ref> Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 200&nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:
* [[Cobalt]] required for biosynthesis of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] family of [[coenzyme]]s
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]]
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxin]], but probably, for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see Extrathyroidal [[iodine]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes,  and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Nickel]] present in [[urease]]
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]]

===Vitamins===
{{Main|Vitamin}}

As with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is the exception: it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of [[UVB radiation]].) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as [[carnitine]], are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not "essential" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different [[phytochemicals]] have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including [[antioxidant]] activity (see below); experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include [[essential amino acid]]s (see [[#Protein|above]]), [[choline]], [[essential fatty acid]]s (see [[#Essential fatty acids|above]]), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.

Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions: [[goiter]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired [[immune system]], disorders of cell [[metabolism]], certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature [[aging]], and poor [[psychology|psychological health]] (including [[eating disorders]]), among many others.<ref>{{cite book | author=Shils et al. | year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=0-7817-4133-5}}</ref> Excess of some vitamins is also dangerous to health (notably [[vitamin A]]), and for at least one vitamin, B6, toxicity begins at levels not far above the required amount.
Deficiency or excess of minerals can also have serious health consequences.

===Water===
{{duplication|dupe = Animal nutrition#Water|date=April 2013}}
{{Main|Drinking water}}
[[Image:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|left|A manual [[water]] [[pump]] in [[China]]]]
About 70% of the non-fat mass of the [[human]] body is made of water.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldwater|first=William|title=Analysis of Adipose Tissue in relation to Body Weight Loss in Man|url=http://jap.physiology.org/search?author1=William+H.+Goldwater&sortspec=date&submit=Submit|publisher=Journal of Applied Physiology|accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> To function properly, the body requires between one and seven [[liter]]s of water per [[day]] to avoid [[dehydration]]; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss increases and daily fluid needs will eventually increase as well.

It is not fully clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, although some experts assert that 8–10 glasses of water (approximately 2 liters) daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |title=Healthy Water Living|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref> The notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source.<ref>[http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993 "Drink at least eight glasses of water a day."

Is there scientific evidence for "8 × 8"?] by Heinz Valdin, Department of Physiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, [[New Hampshire]]</ref> The effect of greater or lesser water intake on weight loss and on constipation is also still unclear.<ref>[http://www.factsmart.org/h2o/h2o.htm Drinking Water – How Much?], Factsmart.org web site and references within</ref> The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the [[Food and Nutrition Board]] of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] read: "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."<ref>Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences. Recommended Dietary Allowances, revised 1945. National Research Council, Reprint and Circular Series, No. 122, 1945 (Aug), p. 3–18.</ref> The latest dietary reference intake report by the [[United States National Research Council]] recommended, generally, (including food sources): 2.7 liters of water total for women and 3.7 liters for men.<ref>[http://www.iom.edu/report.asp?id=18495 Dietary Reference Intakes: Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate], Food and Nutrition Board</ref> Specifically, [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] and [[breastfeeding]] women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. According to the [[Institute of Medicine]] – who recommend that, on average, women consume 2.2 litres and men 3.0 litres – this is recommended to be 2.4 litres (approx. 9 cups) for pregnant women and 3 litres (approx. 12.5 cups) for breastfeeding women since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283 |title=Water: How much should you drink every day? – MayoClinic.com |publisher=MayoClinic.com<! |date= |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>

For those who have healthy kidneys, it is somewhat difficult to drink too much water,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of [[water intoxication]], which can be fatal. In particular, large amounts of de-ionized water are dangerous.

Normally, about 20 percent of water intake comes in food,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} while the rest comes from drinking water and assorted beverages ([[Caffeine|caffeinated]] included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including [[urine]] and [[feces]], [[sweat]]ing, and by [[water vapor]] in the exhaled breath.

====Phytochemicals====
[[File:Colorfull.jpg|thumb|Colorful [[fruit]]s are proposed to be important components of a healthy diet.]]
[[Image:Blackberry fruits10.jpg|thumb|right||[[Blackberry|Blackberries]] are a source of [[polyphenol]]s]]

A growing area of interest is the effect upon human health of undefined natural compounds, collectively called [[phytochemicals]].  These compounds are typically found in edible plants, especially colorful fruits and vegetables, but also other organisms including seafood, algae, and fungi.  One of the principal classes of phytochemicals are [[natural phenol]]s and [[polyphenol]]s, chemicals which might provide certain health benefits. In vitro, these chemicals inhibit the activity of [[reactive oxygen species]] which may be involved in certain diseases, but there remains no scientific evidence for the activity or benefit of polyphenols as antioxidants in the human body.

A well-studied example phytochemical is [[zeaxanthin]], a yellow-pigmented carotenoid present in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. Studies have shown a possible correlation between ingestion of zeaxanthin and [[age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.272.18.1413 |author=Seddon JM, Ajani UA, Sperduto RD, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary carotenoids, vitamins A, C, and E, and advanced age-related macular degeneration.

Both compounds have been observed to collect in the retina following digestion and possibly to protect the rods and cones against intense light.

Pro-vitamin A carotenoids, such as [[beta-carotene]] and [[beta-cryptoxanthin]], contribute to [[vitamin A]] levels in the body, and are under research for potential anti-disease mechanisms, such as in [[arthritis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pattison DJ, Symmons DP, Lunt M, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary beta-cryptoxanthin and inflammatory polyarthritis: results from a population-based prospective study |journal=Am.

It is released more effectively from cells in processed tomato products such as commercial pasta sauce or [[tomato soup]], than in fresh intact tomatoes. Yet, such sauces tend to have high amounts of salt, sugar, and other substances a person may wish or even need to avoid.

Lutein, as another carotenoid example, occurs in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. One study indicates that the lutein present in egg yolk may be more readily absorbed than the lutein from vegetable sources, possibly because of fat solubility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Handelman GJ, Nightingale ZD, Lichtenstein AH, Schaefer EJ, Blumberg JB |title=Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations in plasma after dietary supplementation with egg yolk |journal=Am.

=== Intestinal bacterial flora ===
{{Main|Gut flora}}
It is also known that human [[intestine]]s contain a large population of [[gut flora]] such as ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[L. acidophilus]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', among many others. They are essential to [[digestion]], and are also affected by the food eaten.  Bacteria in the gut perform many important functions for humans, including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of otherwise indigestible food; stimulating cell growth; repressing the growth of harmful bacteria; training the immune system to respond only to pathogens; producing [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]]; and defending against some infectious diseases.

== Advice and guidance ==
{{globalize/Anglosphere|date=September 2012}}

=== United States Governmental policies ===
[[File:MyPyramidFood.svg|thumb|right|The updated [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[MyPyramid|food pyramid]], published in 2005, is a general nutrition guide for recommended [[food]] consumption for [[humans]].]]

In the US, [[dietitian]]s are registered (RD) or licensed (LD) with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association, and are only able to use the title "dietitian," as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state, when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination, respectively. In California, registered dietitians must abide by the {{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=02001-03000&file=2585-2586.8|title=Business and Professions Code of Section 2585-2586.8}}Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist, including unqualified dietitians, as this term is unregulated. Some states, such as the State of Florida, have begun to include the title "nutritionist" in state licensure requirements. Most governments provide guidance on nutrition, and some also impose [[mandatory labeling|mandatory disclosure/labeling]] requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance.

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[HHS|US Department of Health and Human Services]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of a [[MyPyramid|food pyramid]], which superseded the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]] as seen here.

The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.<ref>http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf</ref>  [[Canada's Food Guide]] is another governmental recommendation.

===Teaching===
Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]] the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthy food choices and how to live a healthy life.

A 1985 US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.<ref>Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&page=4  p. 4]. National Academies Press.</ref> Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools, |journal=Am. J.

Heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes are commonly called "Western" diseases because these maladies were once rarely seen in developing countries. [[The China Study|One study in China]] found some regions had essentially no cancer or heart disease, while in other areas they reflected "up to a 100-fold increase" coincident with diets that were found to be entirely plant-based to heavily animal-based, respectively.<ref name = "Campbell-China">{{cite book | author=Campbell T., Campbell T. | title=The China Study | location=Dallas | publisher=Benella Books | year=2005 | isbn=1-932100-38-5}}</ref> In contrast, [[diseases of affluence]] like cancer and heart disease are common throughout the United States. Adjusted for age and exercise, large regional clusters of people in China rarely suffered from these "Western" diseases possibly because their diets are rich in vegetables, fruits and whole grains.<ref name = "Campbell-China"/>

A ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' cover article from November 2005, entitled ''The Secrets of Living Longer'', looks into why certain populations have long life spans. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The article is a lifestyle survey of three populations, [[Sardinia]]ns, [[Okinawa]]ns, and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventists]], who generally display longevity and "suffer a fraction of the diseases that commonly kill people in other parts of the developed world, and enjoy more healthy years of life." In sum, they offer three sets of 'best practices' to emulate. The rest is up to you. In common with all three groups is to follow a [[low-calorie diet]] that consists mainly of "fruits, vegetables, and whole grains." {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The ''National Geographic'' article noted that an [[NIH]]-funded study of 34,000 [[Seventh-Day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] between 1976 and 1988 "...found that the Adventists' habit of consuming beans, soy milk, tomatoes, and other fruits lowered their risk of developing certain cancers. It also suggested that eating whole grain bread, drinking five glasses of water a day, and, most surprisingly, consuming four servings of nuts a week reduced their risk of heart disease."

===The French "paradox"===
{{Main|French paradox}}
It has been discovered that people living in France live longer.<ref name="WPP2010">[http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2010_Highlights.pdf United Nations World Population Prospects: 2010 revision]</ref> Even though they consume more saturated fats than Americans, the rate of heart disease is lower in France than in North America.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  A number of explanations have been suggested:
* Reduced consumption of processed carbohydrate and other junk foods {{Fix
| link  = Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words
| text  = derisive
| title = This text is derisive.}}.
* Regular consumption of [[red wine]].
* More active lifestyles involving plenty of daily exercise, especially walking; the French are much less dependent on cars than Americans.
* Higher consumption of artificially produced trans-fats by Americans, which has been shown to have greater [[lipoprotein]] effects per gram than saturated fat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckel RH, Borra S, Lichtenstein AH, Yin-Piazza SY |title=Understanding the complexity of trans fatty acid reduction in the American diet: American Heart Association Trans Fat Conference 2006: report of the Trans Fat Conference Planning Group |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=16 |pages=2231–46 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17426064 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.181947 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/115/16/2231}}</ref>

However, statistics collected by the [[World Health Organization]] from 1990–2000 show that the incidence of heart disease in France may have been underestimated and in fact be similar to that of neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ducimetière P, Lang T, Amouyel P, Arveiler D, Ferrières J |title=Why mortality from heart disease is low in France : Rates of coronary events are similar in France and southern Europe |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7229 |pages=249–50 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10642245 |pmc=1117444 |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7229.249/a |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/320/7229/249/a}}</ref>

==Sports nutrition==
{{Main|Sports nutrition}}

Individuals with highly active lifestyles require more nutrients.

===Protein===
[[Image:Protein shake.jpg|thumb|right|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]

Protein is an important component of every cell in the body. Hair and nails are mostly made of protein. The body uses protein to build and repair tissues. Also protein is  used to make enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.

The protein requirement for each individual differs, as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein. The 2005 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA), aimed at the general healthy adult population, provide for an intake of 0.8 – 1&nbsp;grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (according to the BMI formula), with the review panel stating that "no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise".<ref>{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A. Driskell|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|page=73|chapter=Utilization of Proteins in Energy Metabolism|authorlink=Mauro Di Pasquale|isbn=978-0-8493-7950-5}}</ref> Conversely, [[Mauro Di Pasquale|Di Pasquale]] (2008), citing recent studies, recommends a minimum protein intake of 2.2 g/kg "for anyone involved in competitive or intense recreational sports who wants to maximize lean body mass but does not wish to gain weight".<ref>{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A. Driskell|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|page=79|chapter=Utilization of Proteins in Energy Metabolism|authorlink=Mauro Di Pasquale|isbn=978-0-8493-7950-5}}</ref>

===Water and salts===
Water is one of the most important nutrients in the sports diet. It helps eliminate food waste products in the body, regulates body temperature during activity and helps with digestion. Maintaining hydration during periods of physical exertion is key to peak performance. While drinking too much water during activities can lead to physical discomfort, dehydration in excess of 2% of body mass (by weight) markedly hinders athletic performance.<ref>http://www.winforum.org/GamePlan-bw.pdf. page 19</ref> Water and salt dosage is based on work performed, lean body mass, and environmental factors, especially ambient temperature and humidity. Maintaining the right amount is key.

Additional carbohydrates and protein taken before, during, and after exercise will improve endurance (increase time to exhaustion) as well as speed recovery as long as the exercise is compatible with digestion of the substance taken, e.g. a steak eaten while running a marathon may not be fully digested and may hinder performance.

===Carbohydrates===
The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates, which is stored in muscle as glycogen – a form of sugar. During exercise, muscle glycogen reserves can be used up, especially when activities last longer than 90&nbsp;min.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Because the amount of glycogen stored in the body is limited, it is important for athletes to replace glycogen by consuming a diet high in carbohydrates. Meeting energy needs can help improve performance during the sport, as well as improve overall strength and endurance.

There are different kinds of carbohydrates: simple (for example from fruits) and complex (for example from grains such as wheat). Simple sugars can be from an unrefined natural source, or may be refined and added to processed food. A typical American consumes about 50% of their carbohydrates as refined sugars. Over the course of a year, the average American consumes 204 [[litres]] (54 US gallons @ 3.78l per gallon) of soft drinks, which contain the highest amount of added sugars.<ref>{{cite book | author=William D. McArdle, Frank I. Katch, Victor L. Katch | title=Exercise Physiology: Energy, Nutrition, and Human Performance | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year=2006 | isbn=0-8121-0682-2}}</ref> Even though carbohydrates are necessary for humans to function, they are not all equally healthful.  When machinery has been used to remove bits of high fiber, the carbohydrates are refined.  These are the carbohydrates found in white bread and fast food.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/basics_carbos.shtml | title=Nutrition – Healthy eating: Bread, cereals and other starchy foods | publisher=BBC | date=July 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref>

==Malnutrition==
{{Main|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption.
Although there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to excessive consumption, according to the United Nations [[World Health Organization]], the real challenge in developing nations today, more than starvation, is combating insufficient nutrition – the lack of nutrients necessary for the growth and maintenance of vital functions.

=== Mental agility ===
{{Main|Nootropic}}

Research indicates that improving the awareness of nutritious meal choices and establishing long-term habits of healthy eating has a positive effect on a cognitive and spatial memory capacity, potentially increasing a student's potential to process and retain academic information.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The "nutrition-learning nexus" demonstrates the correlation between diet and learning and has application in a higher education setting.

:"We find that better nourished children perform significantly better in school, partly because they enter school earlier and thus have more time to learn but mostly because of greater learning productivity per year of schooling."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(00)00118-3 |author=Glewwe P, Jacoby H, King E |title=Early childhood nutrition and academic achievement: A longitudinal analysis |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=345–68 |year=2001}}</ref>

There is limited research available that directly links a student's Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) to their overall nutritional health.  Additional substantive data is needed to prove that overall intellectual health is closely linked to a person's diet, rather than a [[correlation fallacy]].

=== Mental disorders ===
Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], the four most common mental disorders in developed countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Lakhan SE, Vieira KF |title= Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |journal= Nutr J |volume=7 |page=2 |year=2008 |pmid=18208598 |pmc= 2248201 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/2 |issue=1}}</ref> Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (each of which are an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] contained in [[fish oil]], but not in [[flaxseed oil]]), [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], [[folic acid]], and [[inositol]].

=== Cancer ===
Cancer has recently become common in developing countries. According a study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], "In the developing world, cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food, and parasitic infections that attack organs." Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco. Developed countries "tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle' – cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and prostate – that can be caused by obesity, lack of exercise, diet and age."<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Coren| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/03/09/cancer.study/index.html | title=Study: Cancer no longer rare in poorer countries | publisher= CNN | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

A comprehensive worldwide report, [[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]], compiled by the [[World Cancer Research Fund]] and the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]], reports that there is a significant relation between lifestyle (including food consumption) and [[cancer prevention]]. The same report recommends eating mostly foods of plant origin and aiming to meet [[nutritional needs]] through diet alone, while limiting consumption of [[energy]]-dense foods, [[red meat]], [[alcoholic drink]]s and [[salt]] and avoiding [[sugary drink]]s, [[processed meat]] and moldy [[cereals]] (grains) or [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (legumes).

=== Metabolic syndrome ===
Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle-induced [[hyperinsulinemia]] and reduced insulin function (i.e. [[insulin resistance]]) as decisive factors in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and [[clot]] formation (i.e. heart disease) and exaggerated cell division (i.e. cancer). Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called [[metabolic syndrome]]) are characterized by a combination of abdominal [[obesity]], elevated [[blood sugar]], elevated [[blood pressure]], elevated blood [[triglycerides]], and reduced HDL [[cholesterol]]. The negative impact of hyperinsulinemia on prostaglandin PGE1/PGE2 balance may be significant.

The state of [[obesity]] clearly contributes to insulin resistance, which in turn can cause [[type 2 diabetes]]. Virtually all obese and most type 2 diabetic individuals have marked insulin resistance. Although the association between overweight and insulin resistance is clear, the exact (likely multifarious) causes of insulin resistance remain less clear. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that appropriate exercise, more regular food intake and reducing [[glycemic load]] (see below) all can reverse insulin resistance in overweight individuals (and thereby lower blood sugar levels in those who have type 2 diabetes).

Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone [[leptin]], and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced leptin signalling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate.

There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors – such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals – contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. In any case, analogous to the way modern man-made pollution may potentially overwhelm the environment's ability to maintain [[homeostasis]], the recent explosive introduction of high [[glycemic index]] and processed foods into the human diet may potentially overwhelm the body's ability to maintain homeostasis and health (as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic).

=== Hyponatremia ===
Excess water intake, without replenishment of sodium and potassium salts, leads to [[hyponatremia]], which can further lead to [[water intoxication]] at more dangerous levels.  A well-publicized case occurred in 2007, when [[KDND|Jennifer Strange]] died while participating in a water-drinking contest.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6263029.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Why is too much water dangerous? | accessdate=2008-11-09 | date=2007-01-15}}</ref> More usually, the condition occurs in long-distance endurance events (such as [[marathon]] or [[triathlon]] competition and training) and causes gradual mental dulling, headache, drowsiness, weakness, and confusion; extreme cases may result in coma, convulsions, and death.  The primary damage comes from swelling of the brain, caused by increased osmosis as blood salinity decreases.
Effective fluid replacement techniques include Water aid stations during running/cycling races, trainers providing water during team games such as Soccer and devices such as Camel Baks which can provide water for a person without making it too hard to drink the water.

== Processed foods ==
{{Main|Food processing}}

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many [[technology|technologies]] that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of foods as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include [[pasteurisation]], [[autoclavation]], [[drying]], [[salting]], and separation of various components, and all appear to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies undoubtedly have downsides as well.

Modern separation techniques such as [[Gristmill|milling]], [[centrifugation]], and [[pressing]] have enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet to be discovered substances.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Audrey|coauthors=Audia Barnett, Olive-Jean Burrows|title=Effect of Processing on Nutrient Content of foods|journal=Cajanus|volume=37|issue=3|pages=160–164|year=2004|url=http://www.paho.org/English/CFNI/cfni-caj37No304-art-3.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-26|format=PDF}}</ref>

Not only has the direct production of food changed to keep up with the ever evolving American lifestyle, but new types of farming have also emerged. Some of these styles consist of organic or genetically modified farming. Though the methods differ, they have surprising effects on the nutrient value of the produce. According to a study by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), conventionally grown food has just as many flavanoids as organically grown food. In this respect, organic food does not have the advantage over non-organic. Flavonoids are micronutrients which play a large role in preventing both cancer and heart disease.  Surprisingly the food with the most flavonoids is grown not by organic farming, but by a method called sustainable farming, where synthetic fertilizers are used but pesticides are used sparingly. <ref>University of Arizona. 2006. Pesticide Versus Organically Grown Food. Available from: http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1079.html</ref> This proves the possible significance in changing food production on the nutritional value of produce.

Because of changes in production, and hence the reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high glycemic index starches, [[potassium]]/[[sodium]], vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition, processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.

A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of [[beri-beri]] in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin [[thiamine]], causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of [[scurvy]] among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.

As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of the modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g. nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive but nutritionally superior whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.

==History==
Humans have evolved as [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s over the past 250,000 years. The diet of early modern humans varied significantly depending on location and climate. The diet in the tropics tended to be based more heavily on plant foods, while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products. Analysis of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic, along with detailed bone modification studies have shown that cannibalism was also prevalent among prehistoric humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Villa P, Bouville C, Courtin J, ''et al.'' |title=Cannibalism in the Neolithic |journal=Science |volume=233 |issue=4762 |pages=431–7 |year=1986 |month=July |pmid=17794567 |doi=10.1126/science.233.4762.431 }}</ref>

[[Agriculture]] developed about 10,000 years ago in multiple locations throughout the world, providing grains such as [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[maize]], and [[potatoes]], with staples such as [[bread]], [[pasta]], and [[tortillas]]. Farming also provided milk and dairy products, and sharply increased the availability of meats and the diversity of vegetables. The importance of food purity was recognized when bulk storage led to infestation and contamination risks. [[Cooking]] developed as an often ritualistic activity, due to efficiency and reliability concerns requiring adherence to strict recipes and procedures, and in response to demands for food purity and consistency.<ref name=history>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060824032910/http://rcw.raiuniversity.edu/biotechnology/MScBioinformatics/generalnutrition/lecture-notes/lecture-01.pdf ''History of the Study of Nutrition in Western Culture''] (Rai University lecture notes for General Nutrition course, 2004)</ref>

===From antiquity to 1900===
Around 3000 BC the [[Vedic texts]] had mentions of scientific research on nutrition.

The first recorded nutritional experiment is found in the Bible's [[Book of Daniel]]. Daniel and his friends were captured by the king of [[Babylon]] during an invasion of Israel. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial. Daniel and his friends received their diet for 10 days and were then compared to the king's men. Appearing healthier, they were allowed to continue with their diet.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5-16] ([http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Daniel_1#5 alternative translation])</ref>

[[Image:Anaxagoras.png|thumb|right|Anaxagoras]]

Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contained "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.<ref name=history />  Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]] said, "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."<ref name="Smith">{{cite journal | doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7433/0-g | title=Let food by thy medicine… | author=Richard Smith | journal=BMJ |date=24 January 2004 | pages=0–g| volume=328 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | issue=7433}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In the 16th century, scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle.  In 1747, Dr. [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment, discovering that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. The discovery was ignored for forty years, after which British sailors became known as "limeys." The essential [[vitamin C]] within lime juice would not be identified by scientists until the 1930s.

Around 1770, [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the "Father of Nutrition and Chemistry" discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat.  In 1790, [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for fowl survival.  In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] were recognized as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.

In 1816, [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrates]] and [[fat]] lost their body [[protein]] and died in a few weeks, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.{{cn|date=April 2013}}  In 1840, [[Justus Liebig]] discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates ([[sugar]]s), fats ([[fatty acid]]s) and proteins ([[amino acid]]s).  In the 1860s, [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].

In the early 1880s, [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis) but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease.

In 1896, Baumann observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands.  In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi, but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B<sub>1</sub>, also known as [[thiamine]].

===From 1900 to the present===
In the early 20th century, [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition. In 1906, Wilcock and Hopkins showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] was necessary for the survival of rats. He fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed were essential for survival, but the rats died. A second group of rats to which he also fed an amount of milk containing [[vitamins]].<ref>Heinemann 2e Biology Activity Manual by Judith Brotherton and Kate Mundie</ref> [[Gowland Hopkins]] recognized "accessory food factors" other than calories, protein and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], as [[Organic compound|organic]] materials essential to health but which the body cannot synthesize. In 1907, [[Stephen M. Babcock]] and [[Edwin B. Hart]] conducted the [[single-grain experiment]]. This experiment ran through 1911.

In 1912, [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]], a vital factor in the diet, from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to be derived from ammonia. The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century.

In 1913, [[Elmer McCollum]] discovered the first vitamins, fat soluble [[vitamin A]], and water soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency, because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil.<ref>[http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D] - a paper funded by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]</ref> In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil but found it still cured rickets, and named it [[vitamin D]]. Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discovered [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, and originally called it "food factor X" until 1925.

In 1925, Hart discovered that trace amounts of [[copper]] are necessary for [[iron]] absorption. In 1927, [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, for which he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935 he synthesized it, and in 1937 won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]].

In the 1930s, [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components which the body cannot synthesize. In 1935, Underwood and Marston independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]]. In 1936, [[Eugene Floyd Dubois]] showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake. In 1938, [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E. It was synthesised by [[Paul Karrer]].

In 1940, [[rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II]] took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941, the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs) were established by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]].

In 1992, The U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]]. In 2002, a [[Natural Justice]] study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior. In 2005, a study found that obesity may be caused by [[adenovirus]] in addition to bad nutrition.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/854584.stm "Can a virus make you fat?"] at [[BBC News]]; [http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/contagious_obesity_identifying_the_human_adenoviruses_that_may_make_us_fat_9901 "Contagious obesity?
