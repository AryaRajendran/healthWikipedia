The '''health care system in Japan''' provides [[healthcare]] services, including screening examinations, [[prenatal care]] and [[infectious disease]] control, with the patient accepting responsibility for 30% of these costs while the government pays the remaining 70%. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a [[universal health care]] insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national [[health insurance]] programme administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians. For-profit corporations are not allowed to own or operate hospitals. Clinics must be owned and operated by physicians.

== Overview ==
Since 1961 Japan has provided universal health coverage, which allows virtually all access to preventive, curative and rehabilitative services at an affordable cost.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shibuya|first=Kenji|title=Future of Japan’s system of good health at low cost with equity: beyond universal coverage|journal=The Lancet|date=1|year=2011|month=October|volume=378|pages=1106|pmid=21885100}}</ref>

All residents of Japan are required by the law to have health insurance coverage. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national [[health insurance]] program administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians. For-profit corporations are not allowed to own or operate hospitals. Clinics must be owned and operated by physicians.

Medical fees are strictly regulated by the government to keep them affordable. Depending on the family income and the age of the insured, patients are responsible for paying 10%, 20% or 30% of medical fees with the government paying the remaining fee.<ref>[http://www.its-kenpo.or.jp/html_main/h_b.html]</ref> Also, monthly thresholds are set for each household, again, depending on income and age, and medical fees exceeding the threshold are waived or reimbursed by the government. Uninsured patients are responsible for paying 100% of their medical fees, but fees are waived for low-income households receiving government subsidy. Fees are also waived for homeless people when they are brought to the hospital by ambulance.

In 2008, Japan spent about 8.5% of the nation's gross domestic product(GDP), or US$2,873 per capita, on health, ranking 20th among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. That amount was less than the average of 9.6% across OECD countries in 2009, and about half as much as that in the United States.<ref name="OECD">{{cite web|last=OECD|title=OECD Health Data|url=http://www.oecd.org|publisher=OECD|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> The government has well controlled cost over decades by using the nationally uniform fee schedule for reimbursement.

People in Japan have the longest life expectancy at birth of those in any country in the world. Life expectancy at birth was 83 years in 2009 (male 79.6, and female 86.4 years respectively).<ref name="OECD"/> This was achieved in a fairly short time through a rapid reduction in mortality rates secondary to communicable diseases from the 1950s to the early 1960s, followed by a large reduction in stroke mortality rates after mid-60s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ikeda|first=Nayu|title=What has made the population of Japan healthy?|journal=The Lancet|date=17|year=2011|month=September|volume=378|pages=1094|pmid=21885105}}</ref>

In 2008 the number of acute care beds per 1000 total population was 8.1, which was higher than in other OECD countries such as the U.S. (2.7).<ref name="OECD"/> Comparisons based on this number may be difficult to make, however, since 34% of patients were admitted to hospitals for longer than 30 days even in beds that were classified as acute care.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patient survey 2008|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/toukei/saikin/hw/hoken/national/22.html|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> 

In 2008 per 1000 population, the number of practicing physicians was 2.2, which was almost the same as that in U.S. (2.4), and the number of practicing nurses was 9.5, which was a little lower than that in U.S. (10.8), and almost the same as that in UK (9.5) or in Canada (9.2).<ref name="OECD"/> Physicians and nurses are licensed for life with no requirement for license renewal, continuing medical or nursing education, and no peer or utilization review.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hirose|first=Masahiro|title=How can we improve the quality of health care in Japan?

In Japan, services are provided either through regional/national public hospitals or through private hospitals/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge more to those patients without a referral. As above, costs in Japan tends to be quite low compared to those in other developed countries, but utilization rates are much higher. Japanese patients favor medical technology such as CT scans and MRIs, and they receive MRIs at a per capita rate 8 times higher than the British and twice as high as  Americans.<ref name="Sick"/> Japan has about three times as many hospitals per capita as the US<ref name="washingtonpost.09.2009">{{cite web |date= September 7, 2009|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/06/AR2009090601630_pf.html|title = Health Care in Japan: Low-Cost, for Now Aging Population Could Strain System|publisher = [[The Washington Post]]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last= Harden, Blaine |quote=}}</ref> and, on average, Japanese people visit the hospital more than four times as often as the average American.<ref name="washingtonpost.09.2009"/>  Due to large numbers of people visiting hospitals for relatively minor problems, shortage of medical resources can be an issue in some regions. The problem has become a wide concern in Japan, particularly in Tokyo. A report has shown that more than 14,000 emergency patients were rejected at least three times by hospitals in Japan before getting treatment. A government survey for 2007, which got a lot of attention when it was released in 2009, cited several such incidents in the Tokyo area, including the case of an elderly man who was turned away by 14 hospitals before dying 90 minutes after being finally admitted,<ref name="abcnews.2009">{{cite web |date= February 4, 2009|url = http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6801348|title = Injured Man Dies After Rejection by 14 Hospitals|work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher = [[ABC News]]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last= Yamaguchi, Mari|quote=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and that of a pregnant woman complaining of a severe headache being refused admission to seven Tokyo hospitals and later dying of an undiagnosed [[brain hemorrhage]] after giving birth.<ref name="japantimes.6.2008">{{cite web |date= Nov. 6, 2008|url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081106a7.html|title = Another case emerges of pregnant woman rejected by Tokyo hospitals|publisher = [[The Japan Times]]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last=Kyodo News |quote=}}</ref> [[File:Ambulance-interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of standard ambulance]]

==Insurance==
Health insurance is, in general, mandatory for residents of Japan, though there is no penalty on individuals who choose not to comply, and around 10% of the population does not enroll.<ref>http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/85466/E92927.pdf</ref><ref name="npr.2008">{{cite web |date= April 14, 2008|url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89626309|title = Japanese Pay Less for More Health Care|format = |publisher = [[National Public Radio|NPR]]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last=Reid, T.R. |quote=}}</ref>  There are a total of eight health insurance systems in Japan.<ref name="kagoshima">{{cite web |year= 2010 |url = http://www.city.kagoshima.lg.jp/_1010/shimin/foreigner/foreigner-eng-1/0005357.html|title = Health Insurance|publisher = [[kagoshima|City of Kagoshima]]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last= |quote=}}</ref> They can then be divided into two categories, {{Nihongo|Employees' Health Insurance|健康保険|Kenkō-Hoken|}} and {{Nihongo|[[National Health Insurance (Japan)|National Health Insurance]]|国民健康保険|Kokumin-Kenkō-Hoken|}}.

*Union Managed Health Insurance
*Government Managed Health Insurance
*Seaman’s Insurance
*National Public Workers Mutual Aid Association Insurance
*Local Public Workers Mutual Aid Association Insurance
*Private School Teachers’ and Employees’ Mutual Aid Association Insurance

*National Health Insurance for each city, town or village
*National Health Insurance Union

Public health insurance covers most citizens/residents and the system pays 70% or more of medical and prescription drug costs with the remainder being covered by the patient (upper limits apply).<ref name="gaijinass.2009.11.28">{{cite web |date= November 28, 2009|url = http://gaijinass.wordpress.com/2009/11/28/how-to-navigate-the-japanese-health-system/|title = How to navigate the Japanese Health System|format = |publisher = [http://gaijinass.wordpress.com gaijinass]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last=Yosomono |quote=}}</ref>  The monthly insurance premium is paid per household and scaled to annual income.  Supplementary private health insurance is available only to cover the co-payments or non-covered costs, and usually makes a fixed payment per days in hospital or per surgery performed, rather than per actual expenditure.<ref name= "Rapoport-Jacobs-Jonsson p. 157">[[#refRapoportJacobsJonsson2009|Rapoport-Jacobs-Jonsson 1973]], p. 157.</ref><ref>Fukue, Natsuko, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100525i1.html National health insurance a basic universal safety net]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', May 25, 2010, p.3.</ref>

==History==
[[File:National Cancer Center Hospital.jpg|thumb|National Cancer Center Hospital in the [[Tsukiji]] district of [[Tokyo]]]]
The beginning of the Japanese Health care system happened in 1927 when the first Employee Health Insurance plan was created.<ref name= "Kodansha p. 338">[[#refKodansha1993|Kōdansha 1993]], p. 338.</ref>

In 1961, Japan achieved universal health insurance coverage and almost everyone became insured. However, the copayment rates differed greatly. While those who enrolled in Employees' Health Insurance needed to pay only a nominal amount at the first physician visit, their dependents and those who enrolled in National Health Insurance had to pay 50% of the fee schedule price for all services and medications. From 1961 to 1982, this 50% copayment rate was gradually lowered to 30%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ikegami|first=Naoki|title=Japanese universal health coverage: evolution, achievements, and challenges|journal=The Lancet|date=17|year=2011|month=September|volume=378|pages=1108|pmid=21885107}}</ref> 

Since 1983 all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.<ref name= "講談社インターナショナル p. 183">{{harvnb|講談社インターナショナル|2003|p=183}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, government and professional circles were considering changing the system so that primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care would be clearly distinguished within each geographical region. Further, facilities would be designated by level of care and referrals would be required to obtain more complex care. Policy makers and administrators also recognised the need to unify the various insurance systems and to control costs.

By the early 1990s, there were more than 1,000 [[mental hospital]]s, 8,700 general [[hospital]]s, and 1,000 comprehensive hospitals with a total capacity of 1.5 million beds. Hospitals provided both out-patient and in-patient care. In addition, 79,000 [[clinic]]s offered primarily out-patient services, and there were 48,000 [[dentist|dental clinics]]. Most [[physician]]s and [[hospital]]s sold medication directly to patients, but there were 36,000 [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] where patients could purchase synthetic or herbal medication.

National health expenditures rose from about 1 trillion [[yen]] in 1965 to nearly 20 trillion yen in 1989, or from slightly more than 5% to more than 6% of Japan's national income. The system has been troubled with excessive paperwork, assembly-line care for out-patients (because few facilities made appointments), [[over medication]], and abuse of the system because of apparent low [[out-of-pocket expenses]] to patients.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Another problem has been an uneven distribution of health personnel, with rural areas favored over cities.<ref>Masatoshi Matsumoto, Masanobu Okayama, Kazuo Inoue, Eiji Kajii [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1854.2004.00609.x High-tech rural clinics and hospitals in Japan: a comparison to the Japanese average] (2004)</ref>

In the early 1990s, there were nearly 191,400 physicians, 66,800 [[dentist]]s, and 333,000 [[nurse]]s, plus more than 200,000 people licensed to practice [[massage]], [[acupuncture]], [[moxibustion]], and other East Asian therapeutic methods.
