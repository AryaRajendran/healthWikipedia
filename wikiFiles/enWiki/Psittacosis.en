In [[medicine]] ([[pulmonology]]), '''psittacosis''' — also known as '''parrot disease''', '''parrot fever''', and '''ornithosis''' — is a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] [[infectious diseases|infectious disease]] caused by a [[bacterium]] called ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'' (formerly ''[[Chlamydia psittaci]]'') and contracted from [[parrot]]s, such as [[macaw]]s, [[cockatiel]]s and [[budgerigar]]s, and [[pigeon]]s, [[sparrow]]s, [[duck]]s, [[Chicken|hen]]s, [[gull]]s and many other species of bird. The incidence of infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in psittacine birds.

In certain contexts, the word "psittacosis" is used when the disease is carried by any species of bird belonging to the [[Psittacidae]] family, whereas "ornithosis" is used when other birds carry the disease.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000075871|ornithosis}}</ref>

==In humans==
===Symptoms===

In humans, after an incubation period of 5–14 days, the symptoms of the disease range from inapparent illness to systemic illness with severe [[pneumonia]].  It presents chiefly as an atypical pneumonia.  In the first week of psittacosis the symptoms mimic [[typhoid fever]]: prostrating high [[fever]]s, [[arthralgia]]s, [[diarrhea]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[epistaxis]] and [[leukopenia]]. <ref>{{cite web|last=Dugdale|first=David|title=Psittacosis|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000088.htm|publisher=MediLine Plus|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>  Rose spots can appear and these are called Horder's spots.<ref>{{GPnotebook|1255145511}}</ref>  [[Splenomegaly]] is frequent toward the end of first week.  Diagnosis can be suspected in case of respiratory infection associated with splenomegaly and/or epistaxis.  [[Headache]] can be so severe that suggests [[meningitis]] and some nuchal rigidity is not unusual.  Towards the end of first week stupor or even [[coma]] can result in severe cases.

The second week is more akin to acute bacteraemic [[pneumococcal]] pneumonia with continuous high fevers, cough and dyspnoea.  [[X rays]] show patchy infiltrates or a diffuse whiteout of lung fields.

Complications in the form of [[endocarditis]], [[hepatitis]],  [[myocarditis]], [[arthritis]], [[keratoconjunctivitis]], and neurologic complications ([[encephalitis]]) may occasionally occur. Severe pneumonia requiring intensive-care support may also occur. Fatal cases have been reported (less than 1% of cases).

===Diagnosis===
Blood analysis shows leukopenia, [[thrombocytopenia]] and moderately elevated [[liver]] enzymes. Differential diagnosis must be made with typhus, typhoid and atypical pneumonia by [[Mycoplasma]], [[Legionella]] or [[Q fever]]. Exposure history is paramount to diagnosis.
Diagnosis involves [[microbiological culture]]s from respiratory secretions of patients or [[serology|serologically]] with a fourfold or greater increase in [[antibody]] titers against ''C. psittaci'' in blood samples combined with the probable course of the disease. Typical inclusions called "Leventhal-Cole-Lillie bodies"<ref name="isbn0-8138-0423-X">{{cite book |author=Saif, Y.

Culture of Chlamydia psittaci is hazardous and should only be carried out in biosafety laboratories.

===Epidemiology===

Psittacosis was first reported in Europe in 1879.<ref name="potter"/>

In 1929, a highly publicized outbreak of psittacosis hit the United States.  Although not the first report of psittacosis in the United States, it was the largest up to that time.  It led to greater controls on the import of pet parrots.<ref name="potter">{{cite journal |author=Potter ME, Kaufmann AK, Plikaytis BD |title=Psittacosis in the United States, 1979  |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly.

From 2002 through 2009, 66 human cases of psittacosis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and most resulted from exposure to infected pet birds, usually [[cockatiels]], [[parakeets]], parrots, and [[macaws]]. Many more cases may occur that are not correctly diagnosed or reported.
 
Bird owners, pet shop employees, zookeepers and veterinarians are at risk of the infection. Some outbreaks of psittacosis in poultry processing plants have been reported.

===Treatment===
The infection is treated with [[antibiotic]]s. [[Tetracycline]]s and chloramphenicol are the drugs of choice for treating patients with psittacosis.<ref name="pmid9097370">{{cite journal |author=Gregory DW, Schaffner W |title=Psittacosis |journal=Semin Respir Infect |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=7–11 |year=1997 |pmid=9097370 |doi=}}</ref> Most persons respond to oral therapy [[doxycycline]], [[tetracycline]] hydrochloride, or [[chloramphenicol]] palmitate. For initial treatment of severely ill patients, doxycycline hyclate may be administered [[intravenous]]ly. Remission of symptoms usually is evident within 48–72 hours. However, relapse can occur, and treatment must continue for at least 10–14 days after fever abates. Although its [[in vivo]] efficacy has not been determined, [[erythromycin]] probably is the best alternative agent for persons for whom tetracycline is contraindicated (''e.g.'', children aged less than 9 years and [[pregnant]] women).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==In birds==
[[Image:Blue heron chlamydiosis.JPG|thumb|An immature [[Great Blue Heron|blue heron]] with psittacosis]]
In birds, ''Chlamydophila psittaci'' infection is referred to as avian chlamydiosis (AC). Infected birds shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges, which can remain infectious for several months. Many strains remain quiescent in birds until activated under stress. Birds are excellent, highly mobile vectors for the distribution of chlamydial infection because they feed on, and have access to, the detritus of infected animals of all sorts.

=== Signs ===
''C. psittaci'' in birds is often systemic and infections can be inapparent, severe, acute or chronic with intermittent shedding. Signs in birds include "inflamed eyes, difficulty in breathing, watery droppings and green urates."<ref name="titleWinged Wisdom Pet Bird Magazine - Zoonotic (Bird-Human) Diseases: Psittacosis, Salmonellosis">{{cite web |url=http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww23eiii.htm |title=Winged Wisdom Pet Bird Magazine - Zoonotic (Bird-Human) Diseases: Psittacosis, Salmonellosis |accessdate=2007-12-29 |work=}}</ref>

=== Diagnosis===

Initial diagnosis may be via symptoms, but is usually confirmed via an [[antigen]] and [[antibody]] test.  A [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]-based test is also available.  Although any of these tests can confirm psittacosis, false negatives are possible and so a combination of clinical and lab tests is recommended before giving the bird a clean bill of health.<ref name="titleWinged Wisdom Pet Bird Magazine - Zoonotic (Bird-Human) Diseases: Psittacosis, Salmonellosis">{{cite web |url=http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww23eiii.htm |title=Winged Wisdom Pet Bird Magazine - Zoonotic (Bird-Human) Diseases: Psittacosis, Salmonellosis |accessdate=2007-12-29 |format= |work=}}</ref> It may die within 3 weeks.

=== Epidemiology ===
Infection is usually via the droppings of another infected bird, though it can also be transmitted via feathers and eggs,<ref name="titlePSITTACOSIS DISEASE - Pet Birds, Pet Parrots, Exotic Birds">{{cite web |url=http://www.birdsnways.com/articles/psittico.htm |title=PSITTACOSIS DISEASE - Pet Birds, Pet Parrots, Exotic Birds |accessdate=2007-12-29 |format= |work=}}</ref> and is typically either inhaled or ingested.<ref name="titleWinged Wisdom Pet Bird Magazine - Zoonotic (Bird-Human) Diseases: Psittacosis, Salmonellosis" />

''C. psittaci'' strains in birds infect mucosal epithelial cells and macrophages of the respiratory tract. Septicaemia eventually develops and the bacteria become localized in epithelial cells and macrophages of most organs, conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tract. It can also be passed in the eggs. Stress will commonly trigger onset of severe symptoms, resulting in rapid deterioration and death. ''C. psittaci'' strains are similar in virulence, grow readily in cell culture, have 16S-rRNA genes that differ by <0.8%, and belong to eight known serovars. All should be considered to be readily transmissible to humans.

''C. psittaci'' serovar A is endemic among psittacine birds and has caused sporadic zoonotic disease in humans, other mammals, and tortoises.  Serovar B is endemic among pigeons, has been isolated from turkeys, and has also been identified as the cause of abortion in a dairy herd.  Serovars C and D are occupational hazards for slaughterhouse workers and for people in contact with birds.  Serovar E isolates (known as Cal-10, MP or MN) have been obtained from a variety of avian hosts worldwide and, although they were associated with the 1920s–1930s outbreak in humans, a specific reservoir for serovar E has not been identified.  The M56 and WC serovars were isolated during outbreaks in mammals.

=== Treatment ===
Treatment is usually via antibiotics, such as [[doxycycline]] or [[tetracycline]], and can be administered via drops in the water, or injections.<ref name="titlePSITTACOSIS DISEASE - Pet Birds, Pet Parrots, Exotic Birds" />  Many strains of ''C. psittaci'' are susceptible to [[bacteriophage]].

==Use as a biological weapon==
Psittacosis was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential [[biological weapon]]s before the nation suspended [[United States biological weapons program|its biological weapons program]].<ref name=jmcenter>"[http://cns.miis.edu/research/cbw/possess.htm Chemical and Biological Weapons: Possession and Programs Past and Present]", ''James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies'', [[Middlebury College]], April 9, 2002, accessed November 14, 2008.</ref>

==Notable Casualties==
The most high-profile death caused by Parrot Fever is that of Thea Selway, mother of singer [[Philip Selway]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Radiohead: The complete guide|publisher=Pedia Press|pages=45|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Tc9mDpc1sckC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=thea+selway&source=bl&ots=LgRaZ7Asta&sig=0DiuO8FUyHL7sAPMbatXESWGvtE&hl=en}}</ref>

==In Media==
In season 4, episode 6 of the TV series [[The Untouchables]] titled "Bird In Hand", the 1929 outbreak is used as the background story in the search for a mobster who might have contracted the illness.

Season 2, episode 3 of the TV series [[House_(TV_series)|House]], titled [[Humpty Dumpty (House)|"Humpty Dumpty"]], features a case of psittacosis.
