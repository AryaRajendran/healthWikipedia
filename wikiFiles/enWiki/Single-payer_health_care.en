'''Single-payer health care''' is a system in which the government, rather than private insurers, pays for all [[health care]] costs.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single-payer single-payer], Merriam Webster Dictionary</ref>  Single-payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations (as is the case in Canada) or may own and employ healthcare resources and personnel (as is the case in the UK). The term "single-payer" thus only describes the funding mechanism—referring to health care financed by a single public body from a single fund—and does not specify the type of delivery, or for whom doctors work. Although the fund holder is usually the state, some forms of single-payer use a mixed public-private system.

==Background==

Single-payer health insurance collects all medical fees, then pays for all services, through a "single" government (or government-related) source.<ref name="MedicalSubject">Medical Subject Headings thesaurus, National Library of Medicine.[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2008/MB_cgi?mode=&index=17627&field=all&HM=&II=&PA=&form=&input= "Single-Payer System"] Year introduced: 1996, (From Slee and Slee, Health Care Reform Terms, 1993, p106)</ref> In wealthy nations, this kind of publicly managed insurance is typically extended to all citizens and legal residents. Examples include the United Kingdom's [[Healthcare in the United Kingdom|National Health Service]],Australia's [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], and Taiwan's [[healthcare in Taiwan|National Health Insurance]]. 

The standard usage of the term "single-payer health care" refers to health insurance, as opposed to healthcare delivery, operating as a public service and offered to citizens and legal residents towards providing near-universal or [[universal health care]]. The fund can be managed by the government directly or as a publicly owned and regulated agency.<ref name="MedicalSubject" />  Some writers describe publicly administered health care systems as "single-payer plans". Some writers have described any system of health care which intends to cover the entire population, such as voucher plans, as "single-payer plans",<ref>Frank, Robert H. (2007-02-15). A Health Care Plan So Simple, Even Stephen Colbert Couldn’t Simplify It, By ROBERT H. FRANK. New York Times, February 15, 2007. Retrieved from http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/business/15scene.html.</ref> although this is uncommon usage.

Many nations worldwide have single-payer health insurance programs.  These programs generally provide some form of [[universal health care]], which are implemented in a variety of ways. In some cases doctors may be employed, and hospitals run by, the government such as in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/08/03/158020882/in-british-emergency-room-theres-no-card-to-show-there-are-no-bills | title=In British Emergency Room, 'There's No Card To Show; There Are No Bills' | work=[[NPR]] | last=Aguirre | Jessica Camille| date=August 6, 2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>   Alternatively the government may purchase healthcare services from outside organizations. This is the approach taken in [[Health care in Canada|Canada]].

==Australia==
{{main|Health care in Australia}}
Health care in Australia is provided by both private and government institutions. The [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Health and Ageing]], currently [[Tanya Plibersek]], administers national health policy, elements of which (such as the operation of hospitals) are overseen by individual [[States and territories of Australia|states]].  The current system, known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], was instituted in 1984 and coexists with a private health system.  Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% [[income tax]] levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private [[health insurance]]. As well as Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] that considerably subsidises a range of prescription medications.

==Canada==
{{Main|Health care in Canada}}
{{See also|Canadian and American health care systems compared|Medicare (Canada)}}

Health care in Canada is delivered through a [[publicly funded health care]] system, which is mostly free at the point of use and has most services provided by private entities.<ref name="CBC">Public vs. private health care ''CBC'', December 1, 2006.</ref> It is guided by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]] of 1984.<ref name="Canada Health Act">{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/medi-assur/cha-lcs/overview-apercu-eng.php |title=Overview of the Canada Health Act |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The government assures the quality of care through federal standards. The government does not participate in day-to-day care or collect any information about an individual's health, which remains confidential between a person and his or her physician. Canada's provincially based Medicare systems are cost-effective partly because of their administrative simplicity. In each province each doctor handles the insurance claim against the provincial insurer. There is no need for the person who accesses health care to be involved in billing and reclaim. Private insurance is only a minimal part of the overall health care system.

Competitive practices such as advertising are kept to a minimum, thus maximizing the percentage of revenues that go directly towards care. In general, costs are paid through funding from income taxes, except in British Columbia, the only province to impose a fixed monthly premium which is waived or reduced for those on low incomes.<ref>http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/msp/infoben/premium.html#monthly</ref> There are no deductibles on basic health care and co-pays are extremely low or non-existent (supplemental insurance such as Fair Pharmacare may have deductibles, depending on income).  A health card is issued by the Provincial Ministry of Health to each individual who enrolls for the program and everyone receives the same level of care.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php |title=Provincial/Territorial Role in Health |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> There is no need for a variety of plans because virtually all essential basic care is covered, including maternity and infertility problems. Depending on the province, dental and vision care may not be covered but are often insured by employers through private companies. In some provinces, private supplemental plans are available for those who desire private rooms if they are hospitalized. Cosmetic surgery and some forms of elective surgery are not considered essential care and are generally not covered. These can be paid out-of-pocket or through private insurers. Health coverage is not affected by loss or change of jobs, as long as premiums are up to date, and there are no lifetime limits or exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

Pharmaceutical medications are covered by public funds for the elderly or indigent,<ref>CIHI p.91</ref> or through employment-based private insurance. Drug prices are negotiated with suppliers by the federal government to control costs.  [[Family physician]]s (often known as general practitioners or GPs in Canada) are chosen by individuals. If a patient wishes to see a specialist or is counseled to see a specialist, a referral can be made by a GP.  Canadians do wait for some treatments and diagnostic services. Survey data shows that the median wait time to see a special physician is a little over four weeks with 89.5% waiting less than three months. The median wait time for diagnostic services such as MRI and CAT scans<ref>Diagnostic tests defined as the following: non-emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices; computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans; and angiographies that use X-rays to examine the inner opening of blood-filled structures such as veins and arteries.</ref> is two weeks, with 86.4% waiting less than three months.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/pubs/system-regime/2006-fed-comp-indicat/2006-fed-comp-indicat-3-eng.php#a1 Section from Healthy Canadians: A Federal report on Comparable Health Indicators] {{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> The median wait time for surgery is four weeks, with 82.2% waiting less than three months. In addition, there is concern of a "brain drain" as high-quality medical graduates leave Canada for better-paying careers in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/161/8/1028], ''Canadian Medical Association Journal''</ref>

==Taiwan==
{{Main|Healthcare in Taiwan}}
Healthcare in Taiwan is administrated by the [[Department of Health (Republic of China)|Department of Health]] of the [[Executive Yuan]]. As with other [[Developed country|developed economies]], Taiwanese people are well-nourished but face such health problems as chronic [[obesity]] and [[heart disease]].<ref name=cp/> In 2002 [[Taiwan]] had nearly 1.6 physicians and 5.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population.<ref name=cp>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Taiwan.pdf|title=Taiwan country profile|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]]|date=March 2005|accessdate=2008-05-04}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref> In 2002, there were a total of 36 hospitals and 2,601 clinics in the country.

The current [[health care system]] in [[Taiwan]], known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health-care funds. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.<ref>Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 "New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits"], ''Taiwan Journal, January 2nd, 2004'' Accessed March 28, 2008</ref> NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many health care providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Healthcare in the United Kingdom}}
Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], meaning [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] each have their own systems of private and [[publicly funded healthcare]], generally referred to as the [[National Health Service]] or NHS.  Each country having different policies and priorities has resulted in a variety of differences existing between the systems.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm 'Huge contrasts' in devolved NHS] BBC News, 28 August 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] [[BBC]] 2 January 2008</ref> That said, each country provides public healthcare to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] that is free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation.  In addition, each also has a private healthcare sector which is considerably smaller than its public equivalent, with provision of private healthcare acquired by means of private health insurance, funded as part of an employer funded healthcare scheme or paid directly by the customer, though provision can be restricted for those with conditions such as [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]].<ref>[http://www.bupa.co.uk/heartbeat/html/not_covered.html BUPA exclusions] bupa.co.uk, accessed 23 February 2009</ref>

The individual systems are:

* England: [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]]
* Ireland: [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]] (HSENI)
* Scotland: [[NHS Scotland]]
* Wales: [[NHS Wales]]

==United States==

A number of proposals have been made for a universal single-payer healthcare system in the United States, most recently the [[United States National Health Care Act]], ({{USBill|112|HR|676}}, also known as "Medicare for All") but none have achieved more political support than 20% congressional co-sponsorship. The national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but also by savings realized through the provision of preventative [[universal healthcare]] and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/opinion/13krugman.html |title=One Nation, Uninsured |work=The New York Times  |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> An analysis of the bill by [[Physicians for a National Health Program]] estimated the immediate savings at $350 billion per year.<ref name=pnhpsavings>[[Physicians for a National Health Program]] (2008) [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_system_cost.php?page=all "Single Payer System Cost?"] ''PNHP.org''</ref> Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to [[preventative health care]].<ref name=canadasavings>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-5-20 | last1 = Hogg | first1 = W. | last2 = Baskerville | year = 2005 | first2 = N | last3 = Lemelin | first3 = J | title = Cost savings associated with improving appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventive care: cost-consequences analysis | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 20 | pmid = 15755330 | pmc = 1079830 }}</ref> Preventative care can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year in the U.S., because for example [[cancer]] patients are more likely to be diagnosed at [[Cancer staging|Stage I]] where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at [[Cancer staging|Stage III]] or later in an [[emergency room]] where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal.<ref name=intlcompare>{{cite journal | author = Levy A.R.

The '''United States National Health Care Act,''' or the '''Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act''' ({{USBill|113|HR|676}}), is a bill introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Representative [[John Conyers]] (D-MI).<ref name=intro2013>[http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/racs-/-icd-9-/-icd-10/house-reps-introduce-medicare-for-all-bill.html "House Reps Introduce Medicare-for-All Bill"] ''Becker's Hospital Review'', Feb. 14, 2013</ref> The bill had 88 cosponsors in 2009. The act would establish a universal [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States, the rough equivalent of [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada's Medicare]], the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]], and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]'s [[Healthcare in Taiwan|Bureau of National Health Insurance]], among other examples. Under a single payer system, all medical care would be paid for by the [[Government of the United States]], ending the need for private health insurance and premiums, and probably recasting private insurance companies as providing purely supplemental coverage, to be used when non-essential care is sought.

The bill was first introduced in 2003,<ref>{{USBill|108|HR|676}}</ref> when it had 25 cosponsors, and has been reintroduced in each Congress since. During the 2009 health care debates over the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009|bill that became]] the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. H.R. 676 was expected to be debated and voted upon by the House in September 2009,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dc/2009/07/single-payer-gets-a-vote.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Single Payer Gets A Vote (Updated) | date=July 31, 2009}}</ref> but was never debated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-676|title=H.R. 676: United States National Health Care Act or the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act (Govtrack.us)|accessdate=December 1, 2009}}</ref> Advocates who remained staunchly for single-payer health care as the ultimate vote and passage of the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 loomed, tried to present HR 676 as a viable alternative to the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]], H.R.&nbsp;3962, but were ignored, and even in some cases arrested by police during various nationwide debate events, and the bill itself never received significant public support.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] and related government agencies scored the cost of a single payer health care system several times since 1991.  The [[General Accounting Office]] published a report in 1991 noting that "[I]f the US were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer, as in Canada, the savings in administrative costs [10 percent of health spending] would be more than enough to offset the expense of universal coverage.”<ref>[http://archive.gao.gov/d20t9/144039.pdf “Canadian Health Insurance: Lessons for the United States,”] General Accounting Office, June 1991.</ref>  The CBO scored the cost in 1991, noting that "the population that is currently uninsured could be covered without dramatically increasing national spending on health" and that "all US residents might be covered by health insurance for roughly the current level of spending or even somewhat less, because of savings in administrative costs and lower payment rates for services used by the privately insured.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/76xx/doc7652/91-CBO-039.pdf Universal Health Insurance Coverage Using Medicare’s Payment Rates], Congressional Budget Office, December 1991.</ref>  A CBO report in 1993 stated that "[t]he net cost of achieving universal insurance coverage under this single payer system would be negative" in part because "consumer payments for health would fall by $1,118 per capita, but taxes would have to increase by $1,261 per capita" in order to pay for the plan.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/64xx/doc6442/93doc171.pdf “Single-Payer and All-Payer Health Insurance Systems Using Medicare’s Payment Rates”] Congressional Budget Office, April 1993.</ref>  A July 1993 scoring also resulted in positive outcomes, with the CBO stating that, "[a]s the program was phased in, the administrative savings from switching to a single-payer system would offset much of the increased demand for health care services. Later, the cap on the growth of the national health budget would hold the rate of growth of spending below the baseline."<ref>“Estimates of Health Care Proposals from the 102nd Congress” Congressional Budget Office, July 1993.</ref>   The CBO also scored Sen. [[Paul Wellstone]]'s [[American Health and Security Act of 1993]] in December 1993, finding that "by year five (and in subsequent years) the new system would cost less than baseline.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/79xx/doc7946/93doc07b.pdf S.491, American Health Security Act of 1993], Congressional Budget Office, December 1993.</ref>

===State proposals===
Several single-payer state referendums and bills from state legislatures have been proposed, but with the exception of [[Single-payer_health_care#Vermont|Vermont]], all have failed.

====California====
California attempted passage of a single-payer bill as early as 1994,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/statepolicy/1075-index.cfm|title=The California Single-Payer Debate, The Defeat of Proposition 186 – Kaiser Family Foundation |publisher=Kff.org |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>  and the first successful passages of legislation through the [[California State Legislature]], SB 840 or "The California Universal Healthcare Act" (authored by [[Sheila Kuehl]]), occurred in 2006 and again in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/?q=health_care_for_all|title=Healthcare for All Bill Passes&nbsp;— Governor Threatens Veto}}</ref> Both times, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill.<ref>''Marin Independent Journal'': "Leno reintroduces single-payer health plan."

====Illinois====
In 2007, the Health Care for All Illinois Act was introduced and the Illinois House of Representatives' Health Availability Access Committee passed the single-payer bill favorably out of committee by an 8–4 vote.

====Massachusetts====
Massachusetts had passed a universal health care program in 1986, but budget constraints and partisan control of the legislature resulted in its repeal before the legislation could be enacted.<ref>''[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/us/state-referendums-seeking-to-overhaul-health-care-system.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm New York Times]'': State Referendums Seeking to Overhaul Health Care System.

====Minnesota====
The [[Minnesota Health Act]], which would establish a state-wide single payer health plan, has been presented to the Minnesota legislature regularly since 2009.  The bill was passed out of both the Senate Health Housing and Family Security Committee<ref>[http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/schedule/hearing_minutes.php?ls=86&hearing_id=2637&type=minutes#header Committee on Health, Housing and Family Security] Minutes, January 16, 2009.]</ref> and the Senate Commerce and Consumer Protection Committee<ref>[http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/media/media_list.php?ls=86&archive_year=2009&archive_month=02&category=committee&type=video#cmte_comm_021009.rm Video of Senate committee session] in which the bill was passed out of committee.</ref> in 2009, but the House version was ultimately tabled.<ref>[http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/comm/minutes1ls86.asp?comm=86139&id=1663&ls_year=86 Minutes of the House Health Care and Human Services Policy & Oversight Committee], February 25, 2009.</ref>  In 2010, the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a voice vote<ref>[http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/media/media_video_popup.php?flv=cmte_jud_021110.flv Video of Senate committee session] in which the bill was passed on a voice vote.</ref> as well as the House Health Care & Human Services Policy and Oversight Committee.<ref>[http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/audio/ls86/healthpol022310.asx Audio of House Health Care & Human Services Policy and Oversight Committee proceedings].</ref>  In 2011, the bill was introduced as a two-year bill in both the Senate<ref>[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bin/bldbill.php?bill=S0008.0.html&session=ls87 Senate] - Bill Number 0008.</ref> and House,<ref>[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bin/bldbill.php?bill=H0051.0.html&session=ls87 House] - Bill number 0051.</ref> but did not progress.

In September 2011, Governor [[Brian Schweitzer]] announced his intention to seek a waiver from the federal government allowing Montana to set up a single payer health care system.<ref>''[http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/article_2412d7d6-ea12-11e0-8f41-001cc4c002e0.html#ixzz1ZMD4PDML Missoulan]'': Schweitzer wants statewide universal health care program.

====Oregon====
The state of Oregon attempted to pass single payer health care via [[Oregon Ballot Measure 23 (2002)|Oregon Ballot Measure 23]] in 2002, and the measure was rejected by a significant majority.<ref>[http://oregonvotes.org/doc/history/nov52002/abstract/m23.pdf November 25, 2002, General Election Abstract of Votes]</ref>  Previous bills, including the Affordable Health Care for All Oregon Act, have been introduced in the legislature but have never left committee.

September 17, 2012.</ref>  While the bill is considered a single-payer bill, private insurers can continue to operate in the state indefinitely, meaning it does not fit the strict definition of single-payer.  Representative Mark Larson, the initial sponsor of the bill, has described Green Mountain Care's provisions "as close as we can get [to single-payer] at the state level."<ref>American Medical News: [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2011/05/16/gvsa0516.htm Vermont approves universal health program.]  May 16, 2011.</ref>

===Public opinion===
Advocates for single payer point to support in polls, although the polling is mixed depending on how the question is asked.<ref name="politifact1">{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-majority-favor-single-payer-h/ |title=Michael Moore claims a majority favor a single-payer health care system |publisher=PolitiFact |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> Polls from Harvard University in 1988,<ref>Harvard/Harris poll: Robert J.

A 2001 article in the [[public health journal]] ''[[Health Affairs]]'' studied fifty years of American public opinion of various health care plans and concluded that, while there appears to be general support of a "national health care plan," poll respondents "remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right, and do not favor a
single-payer type of national health plan."<ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/>  [[Politifact]] rated a statement by [[Michael Moore]] "false" when he stated that "[t]he majority actually want single-payer health care."  According to Politifact, responses on these polls largely depend on the wording. For example, people respond more favorably when they are asked if they want a system "like Medicare."<ref name="politifact1"/>
