'''Opsismodysplasia''' is a type of [[osteochondrodysplasia|skeletal dysplasia]] (a bone disease that interferes with bone development) first described by Zonana and associates in 1977, and designated under its current name by Maroteaux (1984). Derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''opsismos'' ("late"), the name "opsismodysplasia" describes a delay in [[bone age|bone maturation]]. In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized by [[wikt:micromelia|micromelia]] (short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay of [[ossification]] (bone cell formation), [[platyspondyly]] (flattened [[Vertebral column|vertebrae]]), irregular [[metaphyses]], an array of facial aberrations and [[respiratory distress]] related to chronic [[Respiratory tract infection|infection]]. Opsismodysplasia is [[congenital disorder|congenital]], being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder is [[rare disease|rare]], with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]] pattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder is [[locus (genetics)|located]] on an [[autosome]], and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited. No specific gene has been found to be associated with the disorder. It is similar to [[spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Sedaghatian type]].<ref name=z77>{{cite pmid|922134}}</ref><ref name=mar84>{{cite pmid|6496568}}</ref><ref name=ops03>{{cite pmid|12624139}}</ref><ref name=oaur>{{cite pmid|10076884}}</ref><ref name=orpha>{{cite web |title=::Opsismodysplasia |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert=2746 |work=Orphanet |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>

Opsismodysplasia can be characterized by a delay in [[bone age|bone maturation]], which refers to "bone aging", an expected sequence of developmental changes in the skeleton corresponding to the chronological age of a person. Factors such as gender and ethnicity also play a role in bone age assessment. The only indicator of physical development that can be applied from birth through mature adulthood is bone age. Specifically, the age and maturity of bone can be determined by its state of [[ossification]], the age-related process whereby certain [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] and soft tissue structures are transformed into bone. The condition of [[epiphyseal plate]]s (growth plates) at the ends of the [[long bone]]s (which includes those of the arms, hands, legs and feet) is another measurement of bone age. The evaluation of both ossification and the state of growth plates in children is often reached through [[radiograph]]y (X-rays) of the [[carpal]]s (bones of the [[hand]] and [[wrist]]).<ref>{{cite pmid|2037639}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|8805044}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|9401555}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17369018}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17387000}}</ref> In opsismodysplasia, the process of ossification in long bones can be disrupted by a failure of [[ossification center]]s (a center of organization in long bones, where cartilage cells designated to await and undergo ossification gather and align in rows)<ref name=boss>{{cite book |title=Anatomy, descriptive and applied |author=Gray, Henry; Spitzka, Edward Anthony |year=1910 |publisher=Lea & Febiger |location=the University of California |page=44 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a9wEAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA44&dq=ossification&hl=en&ei=e27HTe2AFoy5twe97tWfBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=ossification&f=false}}</ref> to form. This was observed in a 16-month-old boy with the disorder, who had no apparent ossification centers in the [[carpus|carpals]] (bones of the hand and wrist) or [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsals]] (bones of the foot). This was associated with an absence of ossification in these bones, as well as disfigurement of the hands and feet at age two. The boy also had no ossification occurring in the lower [[femur]] (thigh bone) and upper [[tibia]] (the shin bone).<ref name=b94>{{cite pmid|8209898}}</ref>

== Genetics and cause ==
[[Image:Autorecessive.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Opsismodysplasia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]
Opsismodysplasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.<ref name=oaur/> This means the defective gene(s) responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Currently, no specific mutation in any gene has been found to cause the disorder.<ref name=ops03/><ref name=orpha/>

It appears that the gene inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-like 1 is the cause of this condition in at least some cases.<ref name=Chai2013>Chai EC, Singaraja RR (2013) Opsismodysplasia: Implications of mutations in the developmental gene INPPL1. Clin Genet doi: 10.1111/cge.12136 </ref>

== History and epidemiology ==
The disorder was first described by Jonathan Zonana and associates in 1977.<ref name=z77/> Further observation of four cases of it was reported by Pierre Maroteaux and colleagues in 1982,<ref>{{cite pmid|7163279}}</ref> and Maroteaux was the first to call the disorder "opsismodysplasia", in a 1984 journal report of three affected individuals.<ref name=mar84/> The name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''opsismos'', meaning "late",<ref name=ops03/> while the term [[wikt:dysplasia|dysplasia]] refers to development. Opsismodysplasia is a very [[rare disease|rare disorder]], and is estimated to occur in less than 1 in 1,000,000 people.<ref name=orpha/>
