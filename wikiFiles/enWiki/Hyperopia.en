'''Hyperopia''', commonly known as being '''farsighted''' ([[American English]]), being '''longsighted''' ([[British English]]), or '''hypermetropia''', is a [[wikt:defect|defect]] of [[visual system|vision]] caused by an imperfection in the [[Human eye|eye]] (often when the eyeball is too short or the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] cannot become round enough), causing difficulty [[focusing]] on near objects, and in extreme cases causing a sufferer to be unable to focus on objects at any [[distance]]. As an object moves toward the eye, the eye must increase its [[optical power]] to keep the image in focus on the retina. If the power of the cornea and lens is insufficient, as in hyperopia, the image will appear blurred.

People with hyperopia can experience [[defocus aberration|blurred vision]], [[asthenopia]], [[accommodation (eye)#Accommodative dysfunction|accommodative dysfunction]], [[binocular vision|binocular dysfunction]], [[amblyopia]], and [[strabismus]].<ref name="AOA Hyperopia">American Optometric Association.

''[http://www.aoa.org/documents/CPG-17.pdf Optometric Clinical Practice Guideline: Care of the patient with presbyopia.]'' 1998.</ref> Presbyopes who report good far vision typically experience blurry near vision because of a reduced [[accommodative amplitude]] brought about by natural aging changes with the [[crystalline lens]].<ref name="AOA Presbyopia"/> It is also sometimes referred to as farsightedness, since in otherwise normally-sighted persons it makes it more difficult to focus on near objects than on far objects.<ref>Kazuo Tsubota, Brian S.

The causes of hyperopia are typically genetic and involve an eye that is too short or a cornea that is too flat, so that images focus at a point behind the retina.

==Classification of hyperopia==
Hyperopia is typically classified according to clinical appearance, its severity, or how it relates to the eye's [[accommodation (eye)|accommodative status]].<ref name="AOA Hyperopia"/>

==Classification by clinical appearance==
* Simple hyperopia
* Pathological hyperopia
* Functional hyperopia

==Symptoms==

Blurred vision of close objects

Crossed eyes (strabismus) in some children

Eye strain

Headache while reading

Mild farsightedness may not cause any problems except for a need for reading glasses.

==Signs and Tests==

A farsighted person has trouble reading the Jaeger eye chart (the chart for near reading), but find it easy to read the Snellen eye chart (the chart for distance).

A general eye examination, or standard ophthalmic exam may include:

Eye pressure measurement (See: Tonometry)

Refraction test, to determine the correct prescription for glasses

Retinal examination

Slit-lamp exam of the structures at the front of the eyes

Test of color vision, to look for possible color blindness

Tests of the muscles that move the eyes

Visual acuity, both at a distance (Snellen), and close up (Jaeger)

==Causes==
Hyperopia can be caused by sinus infections, injuries, migraines, aging or genetics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Farsightedness is the result of the visual image being focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. It may be caused by the eyeball being too small or the focusing power being too weak.

Farsightedness is often present from birth, but children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps make up for the problem. As aging occurs, glasses or contact lenses may be required to correct the vision. If you have family members who are farsighted, you are also more likely to become farsighted.

==Diagnosis==
[[Visual acuity]] is affected according to the amount of hyperopia, as well as the patient's age, visual demands, and accommodative ability.<ref name="AOA Hyperopia"/>

In severe cases of hyperopia from birth, the brain has difficulty merging the images that each individual eye sees. This is because the images the brain receives from each eye are always blurred. A child with severe hyperopia has never seen objects in detail and might present with [[amblyopia]] or [[strabismus]]. If the brain never learns to see objects in detail, then there is a high chance that one eye will become dominant. The result is that the brain will block the impulses of the nondominant eye with resulting [[amblyopia]] or [[strabismus]]. In contrast, the child with [[myopia]] can see objects close to the eye in detail and does learn at an early age to see detail in objects.

The child with hyperopia will typically stand close in front of a television. One would have expected that the child would stand far away because the child is hyperopic, but because the brain has never learned to see detailed lines and object contours the child sees objects blurred. While children with [[myopia]] learn to see sharp lines because they can see perfectly well very close to their eyes, the brain of a child with hyperopia cannot see sharp lines, so they stand right in front of the television to at least see blurred images. This blurred vision may also cause a child to develop a [[squint]] because the two eyes do not detect sharp lines which the brain can use to map the separate images of the two eyes together to form a single image. Each eye functions independently. So a child with hyperopia from birth presents with decreased [[visual perception]].

The parents of a child with hyperopia do not always realize that the child has a problem at an early age. A hyperopic child might have problems with catching a ball because of blurred vision and because of a decreased ability to see three-dimensional objects. The child will typically perform below average at school. As soon as a child starts identifying images, a parent might find that the child cannot see small objects or pictures.

==Treatment==
Various [[eye care professional]]s, including [[ophthalmologist]]s, [[optometrist]]s, [[orthoptist]]s, and [[optician]]s, are involved in the treatment and management of hyperopia. At the conclusion of an [[eye examination]], an eye doctor may provide the patient with an [[eyeglass prescription]] for [[corrective lens]]es.

Minor amounts of hyperopia are sometimes left uncorrected.  However, larger amounts may be corrected with [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex lens]]es in [[eyeglasses]] or [[contact lenses]]. Convex lenses have a positive [[dioptre|dioptric value]], which causes the light to focus closer than its normal range. 

Hyperopia is sometimes correctable with various [[refractive surgery]] procedures ([[LASIK]]). It can also be corrected with special convex lenses.

==Complications==

Farsightedness can be a risk factor for  Acute angle closure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002587/[[Glaucoma]]] and crossed eyes.
