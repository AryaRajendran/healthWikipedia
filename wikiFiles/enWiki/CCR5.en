'''C-C chemokine receptor type 5''', also known as '''CCR5''' or '''CD195''', is a [[protein]] on the surface of [[white blood cell]]s that is involved in the [[immune system]] as it acts as a [[receptor (biology)|receptor]] for [[chemokine]]s. This is the process by which T cells are attracted to specific tissue and organ targets. Many forms of [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[AIDS]], initially use CCR5 to enter and infect host cells. A few individuals carry a [[mutation]] known as [[#CCR5-Δ32|CCR5-Δ32]] in the CCR5 [[gene]], protecting them against these strains of HIV.

In humans, the ''CCR5'' gene that encodes the CCR5 protein is [[Locus (genetics)|located]] on the short [[(p) arm]] at position 21 on [[chromosome 3]]. Certain populations have inherited the ''Delta 32'' mutation resulting in the [[genetic deletion]] of a portion of the CCR5 gene. [[Homozygous]] carriers of this mutation are resistant to [[HIV tropism|M-tropic strains]] of [[HIV-1 infection]].<ref name="pmid8751444">{{cite journal | author = Samson M, Libert F, Doranz BJ, Rucker J, Liesnard C, Farber CM, Saragosti S, Lapoumeroulie C, Cognaux J, Forceille C, Muyldermans G, Verhofstede C, Burtonboy G, Georges M, Imai T, Rana S, Yi Y, Smyth RJ, Collman RG, Doms RW, Vassart G, Parmentier M | title = Resistance to HIV-1 infection in caucasian individuals bearing mutant alleles of the CCR-5 chemokine receptor gene | journal = Nature | volume = 382 | issue = 6593 | pages = 722–5 | year = 1996 | month = August | pmid = 8751444 | doi = 10.1038/382722a0  }}</ref>

CCR5 is predominantly [[Gene expression|expressed]] on [[T cell]]s, [[macrophage]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s and [[microglia]]. It is likely that CCR5 plays a role in inflammatory responses to infection, though its exact role in normal immune function is unclear.

== HIV ==
{{further2|[[HIV tropism]] and [[Entry inhibitors]]}}
[[HIV]] most commonly uses CCR5 and/or [[CXCR4]] as a [[co-receptor]] to enter its target cells. Several chemokine receptors can function as viral coreceptors, but CCR5 is likely the most physiologically important coreceptor during natural infection. The normal [[ligand]]s for this receptor, [[CCL5|RANTES]], [[CCL4|MIP-1''β'']], and [[CCL3|MIP-1''α'']], are able to suppress HIV-1 infection ''in vitro''. In individuals infected with HIV, CCR5-using viruses are the predominant species isolated during the early stages of viral infection,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson J, Akkina R |title=Complete Knockdown of CCR5 by lentiviral vector-expressed siRNAs and protection of transgenic macrophages against HIV-1 infection |journal=Gene Therapy |issue=14 |pages=1287–1297 |year=2007 |pmid=17597795 |doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3302958 |volume=14}}</ref> suggesting that these viruses may have a selective advantage during transmission or the acute phase of disease. Moreover, at least half of all infected individuals harbor only CCR5-using viruses throughout the course of infection.

A number of new experimental HIV drugs, called [[CCR5 receptor antagonist]]s, have been designed to interfere with the interaction between CCR5 and HIV, including [[PRO140]] ([[Progenics]]), [[Vicriviroc]] ([[Schering Plough]]), [[Aplaviroc]] (GW-873140) ([[GlaxoSmithKline]]) and [[Maraviroc]] (UK-427857) ([[Pfizer]]).  A problem of this approach is that, while CCR5 is the major co-receptor by which HIV infects cells, it is not the only such co-receptor. It is possible that under selective pressure HIV will evolve to use another co-receptor.  However, examination of viral resistance to AD101, molecular [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of CCR5, indicated that resistant viruses did not switch to another coreceptor (CXCR4) but persisted in using CCR5, either through binding to alternative domains of CCR5, or by binding to the receptor at a higher affinity.

'''CCR5-Δ32''' (or '''CCR5-D32''' or '''CCR5 delta 32''') is an [[allele]] of CCR5.<ref name="pmid14645720">{{cite journal | author = Galvani AP, Slatkin M | title = Evaluating plague and [[smallpox]] as historical selective pressures for the CCR5-Delta 32 HIV-resistance allele | journal = Proc.

CCR5-Δ32 is a [[deletion mutation]] of a gene that has a specific impact on the function of [[T cell]]s.<ref>http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30117172?uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21100843313171</ref> At least one copy of CCR5-Δ32 is found in about (5–14%) of people of [[Northern European]] descent. There also is a small minority (1%) with the same mutation amongst [[Southern European]]s or [[Balkan Peninsula]]. It has been hypothesized that this [[allele]] was favored by [[natural selection]] during the [[Black Death]] for Northern Europeans. In areas such as [[Corinth]] in [[Ancient Greece]], [[prostitution]] may have led to infection, since a similar virus existed which had flu-like symptoms and later continued to weaken the immune system of those infected. It was at the time not known how it was spread but the [[Plague of Athens]] and many later diseases in the [[Balkans]] may have also influenced the [[genetic mutations]]. <ref name="Diseases in the Ancient Greek World">{{cite Book | author = Mirko D.

The allele has a negative effect upon T cell function, but appears to protect against smallpox and HIV. ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' (the bubonic plague bacterium) was demonstrated in the laboratory not to associate with CCR5. Individuals with the Δ32 allele of CCR5 are healthy, suggesting that CCR5 is largely dispensable. However, CCR5 apparently plays a role in mediating resistance to [[West Nile virus]] infection in humans, as CCR5-Δ32 individuals have shown to be disproportionately at higher risk of West Nile virus in studies,<ref name="pmid16418398">{{cite journal | author = Glass WG, McDermott DH, Lim JK, Lekhong S, Yu SF, Frank WA, Pape J, Cheshier RC, Murphy PM | title = CCR5 deficiency increases risk of symptomatic West Nile virus infection | journal = J.

This hypothesis was tested in an AIDS patient who had also developed [[myeloid leukemia]], and was treated with [[chemotherapy]] to suppress the cancer. A [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplant]] containing [[stem cell]]s from a matched donor was then used to restore the immune system.
