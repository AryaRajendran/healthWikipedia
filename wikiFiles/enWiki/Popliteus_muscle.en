The '''popliteus muscle''' in the leg is used for unlocking the [[knees]] during walking/standing by [[laterally rotating]] the [[femur]] on the [[tibia]] (or medially rotating the tibia) during a closed chain movement (such as one with the foot in contact with the ground).

==Origin and insertion==
It originates from lateral surface of [[Lateral epicondyle of the femur|lateral epicondyle]] on the [[femur]], origin is intracapsular outer margin of the [[lateral meniscus]] in the knee joint. The muscle insertion is on the posterior surface of the [[body of tibia]] above the [[soleal line]].

==Innervation==
Nerve supply is via the [[tibial nerve]] from spinal roots L5 and S1.

==Action==
The Popliteus assists in flexing the leg upon the [[thigh]]; when the leg is flexed, it will rotate the tibia inward. 

It is especially called into action at the beginning of the act of bending the knee, in as much as it produces the slight [[inward rotation]] of the tibia, which is essential in the early stage of this movement.

When the knee is in full extension; the femur slightly medially rotates on the tibia to lock the knee joint in place. Popliteus is often referred to as the "Key" to unlocking the knee since it begins knee flexion by laterally rotating the femur on the tibia. 

Popliteus is also attached to the lateral meniscus in the knee; and draws it posteriorly during knee flexion to prevent crushing the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] between the tibia and femur as the knee flexes.

==Variations==
Additional head from the [[sesamoid bone]] in the outer head of the [[gastrocnemius muscle]]. 

Rarely an additional inconstant muscle; the [[popliteus minor]] is seen. It originates from the femur on the inner side of the [[plantaris muscle]] and inserts into the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. 

Peroneotibialis, 14% of population.  Origin is inner side of the head of the fibula, insertion into the upper end of the oblique line of the tibia, it lies beneath the popliteus.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/107/pages/page485.html Gray, Henry. 1918.

==Trigger points==
A popliteus shortened by [[trigger point]]s can cause pain near its tendinous origin at the lateral knee.
