'''Beta-secretase 1''' (BACE1) also known as '''beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1''' (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1), '''memapsin-2''' (membrane-associated aspartic protease 2), and '''aspartyl protease 2''' (ASP2) is an [[enzyme]] that in humans is encoded by the ''BACE1'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid10531052">{{cite journal | author = Vassar R, Bennett BD, Babu-Khan S, Kahn S, Mendiaz EA, Denis P, Teplow DB, Ross S, Amarante P, Loeloff R, Luo Y, Fisher S, Fuller J, Edenson S, Lile J, Jarosinski MA, Biere AL, Curran E, Burgess T, Louis JC, Collins F, Treanor J, Rogers G, Citron M | title = Beta-secretase cleavage of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein by the transmembrane aspartic protease BACE | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = 5440 | pages = 735–41 | year = 1999 | month = October | pmid = 10531052 | doi =10.1126/science.286.5440.735  | url = | issn = }}</ref>

==Role in Alzheimer's disease==
Generation of the 40 or 42 [[amino acid]]-long [[amyloid beta|amyloid-β]] [[peptides]] that aggregate in the [[brain]] of Alzheimer's patients requires two sequential cleavages of the [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP). Extracellular cleavage of APP by BACE creates a soluble extracellular fragment and a cell membrane-bound fragment referred to as C99. Cleavage of C99 within its transmembrane domain by [[gamma-secretase|γ-secretase]] releases the intracellular domain of APP and produces amyloid-β.  Since [[alpha-secretase]] cleaves APP closer to the [[cell membrane]] than BACE does, it removes a fragment of the amyloid-β peptide. Initial cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase rather than BACE prevents eventual generation of amyloid-β.

Unlike APP and the [[presenilin]] proteins important in γ-secretase, no known [[mutations]] in the [[gene]] encoding BACE cause early-onset, [[familial Alzheimer's disease]], which is a rare form of the disorder.  However, levels of this enzyme have been shown to be elevated in the far more common late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's. The physiological purpose of BACE's cleavage of APP and other transmembrane proteins is unknown.  [[BACE2]] is a close [[homology (biology)|homolog]] of BACE1 with no reported APP cleavage ''in vivo''.

However a single residue mutation in APP reduces the ability of BACE-1 to cleave it to produce amyloid-beta and reduces the risk of Alzheimers and other cognitive declines.<ref name=APP2012/><ref name=Jonsson2012>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11283.html |title=A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive decline |doi=10.1038/nature11283 |year=2012 |author=Jonsson et al. }}</ref>

==BACE inhibitors==
Drugs to block this enzyme (BACE inhibitors) in theory would prevent the build up of beta-amyloid and may help slow or stop Alzheimers disease.  {{As of|2007|9}} Several companies are in the early stages of development and testing of this new potential class of treatment.<ref name="pmid16644763">{{cite journal | author = Walker LC, Rosen RF | title = Alzheimer therapeutics-what after the cholinesterase inhibitors? | journal = Age Ageing | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 332–5 | year = 2006 | month = July | pmid = 16644763 | doi = 10.1093/ageing/afl009 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17685503">{{cite journal | author = Baxter EW, Conway KA, Kennis L, Bischoff F, Mercken MH, Winter HL, Reynolds CH, Tongue BA, Luo C, Scott MK, Huang Y, Braeken M, Pieters SM, Berthelot DJ, Masure S, Bruinzeel WD, Jordan AD, Parker MH, Boyd RE, Qu J, Alexander RS, Brenneman DE, Reitz AB | title = 2-Amino-3,4-dihydroquinazolines as inhibitors of BACE-1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme): Use of structure based design to convert a micromolar hit into a nanomolar lead | journal = J.

== Relationship to plasmepsin ==
