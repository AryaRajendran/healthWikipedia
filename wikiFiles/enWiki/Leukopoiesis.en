'''Leukopoiesis''' is a form of [[hematopoiesis]] in which white blood cells (WBC, or [[leukocytes]]) are formed in [[bone marrow]] located in bones in adults and hematopoietic organs in the fetus. White blood cells, indeed all blood cells, are formed from the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic [[stem cell]]s which give rise to several cell lines with more limited differentiation potential. These immediate cell lines, or colonies, are progenitors of red blood cells ([[erythrocyte]]s), platelets ([[megakaryocyte]]s), and the two main groups of WBCs, [[myelocyte]]s and [[lymphocyte]]s.
