'''Family planning''' is the [[planning]] of when to have [[child]]ren,<ref name=OPAMission>{{cite web |url=http://www.hhs.gov/opa/about/mission/index.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher=US Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Population Affairs}}</ref>    and the use of [[birth control]]<ref name="WHOFP" /><ref name="UKNHS" />    and other techniques to implement such plans. Other techniques commonly used include [[sex education|sexuality education]],<ref name="UKNHS" /><ref name="USDOH-FPSvcs" />    prevention and management of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s,<ref name="UKNHS">[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=839 What services do family planning clinics provide? — Health Questions — NHS Direct]</ref>    [[pre-conception counseling]]<ref name="UKNHS" />    and [[pregnancy#Management|management]], and [[infertility]] management.<ref name="WHOFP">[http://www.who.int/topics/family_planning/en/ Family planning] — WHO</ref>
Family planning is choosing the number of children in a family and the length of time between their births.<ref>WHO</ref>

Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym for the use of [[birth control]], however, it often includes a wide variety of methods, and practices that are not birth control.  It is most usually applied to a [[female]]-[[male]] couple who wish to limit the number of children they have and/or to control the timing of [[pregnancy]] (also known as ''spacing children'').  Family planning may encompass [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]], as well as [[abortion]].<ref>See, e.g., Mischell DR. "Family planning: contraception, sterilization, and pregnancy termination." In: Katz VL, Lentz GM, Lobo RA, Gershenson DM, eds. ''Comprehensive Gynecology''. 5th ed. Philadelphia, Pa: Mosby Elsevier; 2007:chap 14.</ref>

Family planning services are defined as "educational, comprehensive medical or social activities which enable individuals, including minors, to determine freely the number and spacing of their children and to select the means by which this may be achieved."<ref name="USDOH-FPSvcs">[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/systems/ncands/ncands98/glossary/glossary.htm US Dept. of Health, Administration for children and families]</ref>

==Purposes==

Raising a child requires significant amounts of resources: time,<ref name=USDAChildExpense /> social, financial,<ref>[http://www.msmoney.com/mm/planning/marriage/family_planning.htm MsMoney.com — Marriage, Kids & College — Family Planning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and environmental.
Planning can help assure that resources are available. The purpose of family planning is to make sure that any couple, man, or woman who has the desire to have a child has the resources that are needed in order to complete this goal.<ref>{{cite web| title=Office of Family Planning| url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/OFP/Pages/default.aspx| publisher=California Department of Public Health}}</ref>{{dubious|date=March 2012}}  With these resources a couple, man or women can explore the options of natural birth, surrogacy, artificial insemination or adoption. In the other case, if the person does not wish to have a child at the specific time, they can investigate the resources that are needed to prevent pregnancy, such as birth control, contraceptives, or physical protection and prevention.

Waiting until the mother is at least 18 years old before trying to have children improves maternal and child health.<ref name=USAIDHTSP>{{cite web |url=http://www.esdproj.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Themes_Spacing_KeyMessages |

Also, if additional children are desired after a child is born, it is healthier for the mother and the child to wait at least 2 years after the previous birth before attempting to conceive (but not more than 5 years).<ref name=USAIDHTSP/>     After a [[miscarriage]] or [[abortion]], it is healthier to wait at least 6 months.<ref name=USAIDHTSP/>

When planning a family women who are over the age of 35 should be aware of the risks of having a child at that age.  Older women are at a higher risk of having a child with autism and down syndrome, the chances of having multiple births increases, which cause further late-pregnancy risks, they have an increased chance of developing [[gestational diabetes]], the need for a Caesarian-section is greater, older women's bodies are not as well-suited for delivering a baby.  The risk of prolonged labor is higher. Older mothers have a higher risk of a long labor, putting the baby in distress.

"Family planning benefits the health and well-being of women and families throughout the world. Using contraception can help to avoid unwanted pregnancies and space births; protect against STDs, including HIV/AIDS; and provide other health benefits."<ref>[http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1fp.htm Reproline Family Planning]</ref>

==Modern methods==
Modern methods of family planning include [[birth control]], [[assisted reproductive technology]] and family planning programs.

In cases were couples may not want to have children just yet and plan with time family planning programs help a lot. Federal family planning programs reduced childbearing among poor women by as much as 29 percent, according to a University of Michigan study.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sampler.isr.umich.edu/2011/research/family-planning-federal-program-reduced-births-to-poor-women-by-nearly-30-percent/  | title = Family planning: Federal program reduced births to poor women by nearly 30 percent | accessdate = 2012-03-19}}</ref>

Adoption sometimes used to build a family. There are seven steps that one must make towards adoption. You must decide to pursue an adoption, apply to adopt, complete an adoption home study, get approved to adopt, be matched with a child, receive an adoptive placement, and then legalize the adoption.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Adopt|url=http://www.adoptuskids.org/for-families/how-to-adopt|publisher=Adoption Exchange Association |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>

===Birth control===
{{main|Birth control}}

Birth control are techniques used to prevent [[unwanted pregnancy]].
[[File:Family planning Ethiopia (good effects).JPG|thumbnail|right|Placard showing positive effects of familiy planning (Ethiopia)]]
There are a [[comparison of contraceptive methods|range of contraceptive methods]], each with unique advantages and disadvantages. Any of the widely recognized methods of birth control is much more effective than no method. Behavioral methods that include intercourse, such as [[withdrawal]] and [[calendar based methods]] have little up front cost and are readily available, but are much less effective in typical use than most other methods. [[Long-acting reversible contraceptive]] methods, such as IUD and implant are highly effective and convenient, requiring little user action. When cost of failure is included, IUDs and [[vasectomy]] are much less costly than other methods.
In addition to providing birth control, [[condom|male]] or [[female condom]]s protect against [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STD).  Condoms may be used alone, or in addition to other methods, as backup or to prevent STD. Surgical methods ([[tubal ligation]], [[vasectomy]]) provide long term contraception for those who have completed their families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Birth control methods fact sheet|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-methods.cfm|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>

===Assisted reproductive technology===
{{Main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
Some [[family|families]] use modern medical advances in family planning. For example in [[surrogacy]] treatments a woman agrees to become pregnant and deliver a child for another couple or person.

There are two types of surrogacy: traditional and [[gestational]]. [[Traditional Surrogacy]] is where the Surrogate uses her own eggs AND carries the child for her Intended Parents. This procedure is done in a doctor's office through IUI. This type of surrogacy obviously includes a genetic connection between the surrogate and the child. Legally speaking, the Surrogate will have to disclaim any interest in the child to complete the transfer to the Intended Parents. A gestational surrogacy occurs when the Intended Mother's or a donor egg is fertilized outside the body and then the embryos are transferred into the uterus. The woman who carries the child is often referred to as a Gestational Carrier. The legal steps to confirm parentage with the Intended Parents are generally easier than in a traditional because there is no genetic connection between child and Carrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Surrogate Mother or Gestational Carrier?| url=http://infertilityanswers.org/surrogacy|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref> 

In [[sperm donation]]s, pregnancies are usually achieved using donated sperm by [[artificial insemination]] (either by [[intracervical insemination]] or [[intrauterine insemination]]) and less commonly by invitro fertilization ([[IVF]]), usually known in this context as [[Assisted reproductive technology]] (ART), but insemination may also be achieved by a donor having [[sexual intercourse]] with a woman for the sole purpose of initiating conception. This method is known as natural [[insemination]] (NI).

Mapping of a woman's [[ovarian reserve]], [[Ovarian follicle|follicular]] dynamics and associated [[female reproductive biomarkers|biomarkers]] can give an individual prognosis about future chances of pregnancy, facilitating an informed choice of when to have children.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms043}}</ref>

The world's largest international source of funding for population and reproductive health programs is the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA). The main goals of the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action are:

* Universal access to [[reproductive health]] services by 2015
* Universal primary education and closing the gender gap in education by 2015
* Reducing maternal mortality by 75% by 2015
* Reducing [[infant mortality]]
* Increasing life expectancy
* Reducing [[HIV]] infection rates in persons aged 15–24 years by 25% in the most-affected countries by 2005, and by 25% globally by 2010

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[World Bank]] estimate that $3.00 per person per year would provide basic family planning, maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries.  This would include [[contraception]], prenatal, delivery and post-natal care in addition to postpartum family planning and the promotion of [[condoms]] to prevent [[sexually transmitted infections]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/2319 | title = Promises to Keep: The Toll of Unintended Pregnancies on Women's Lives in the Developing World | accessdate = 2009-02-03}}</ref>

===China===
{{Main|One-child policy}}
[[People's Republic of China|China]]'s ''[[one-child policy]]'' forces couples to have no more than one child. Beginning in 1979,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kane|first=Penny|title=China's one child family policy|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116810/}}</ref> the policy was instated to control the rapid population growth that was occurring in the nation at that time. With the rapid change in population, China was facing many impacts of the rapid population growth including poverty and homelessness. As a developing nation, the Chinese government was concerned that a continuation of the rapid population growth that had been occurring would hinder their development as a nation. The process of family planning varied throughout China, as many different people differed in their responsiveness to the one child policy, based on location and socioeconomic status. For example, many families in the cities accepted this policy more readily based on the lack of space, money, and resources that are often offered in the cities. However, the people in rural areas of China were more hesitant in accepting this policy.   Since the policy was put into place in 1979, over 400 million births have been prevented in China.<ref name="FlorCruz">{{cite news|last=FlorCruz|first=Jaime|title=China copes with promise and perils of one child policy|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-28/asia/world_asia_china-one-child_1_family-planning-policy-population-policy-china/2?_s=PM:ASIA|publisher=CNN|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=27 September 2010}}</ref>  China's population policy has been credited with a very significant slowing of China's population growth which had been higher before the policy was implemented. However,  it has come under criticism that the policy has resulted in the abuse of women in China. Oftentimes implementation of the policy has involved forced [[abortion]]s and [[forced sterilization]]. However, while the punishment of "unplanned" pregnancy is a large fine, both forced abortion and forced sterilization can be charged with intentional assault, which is punished with up to 10 years' imprisonment.

Another aspect of family planning in China due to the one-child policy is the differentiation between the desire for male and female children in both urban and rural locations. In the Chinese culture, the desire for a male child is much harder, making the abandonment or abortion of female infants or fetuses common in the rural areas of the nation.<ref name="FlorCruz"/> Another issue that is raised in the one-child policy in China is the information in regards to naturally giving birth to twins or triplets. If this situation arises, the family is allowed to keep the children because of the natural causes of this impregnation.

According to a 2004 study, current pregnancies were termed "desired and timely" by 58% of respondents, while 23% described them as "desired, but untimely", and 19% said they were "undesired".  As of 2004, the share of women of reproductive age using hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods was about 46% (29% intrauterine, 17% hormonal).<ref name="und">[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/nationalreports/europethecis/russia/NHDR_Russia_2008_Eng.pdf National Human Development Report Russian Federation 2008], [[UNDP]],''pages 47–49'', Retrieved on 10 October 2009</ref>  During the soviet era high quality contraceptives were difficult to obtain, and abortion became the most common way of preventing unwanted births.  Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union abortion rates have fallen considerably, but they are still higher than rates in many developed countries.
