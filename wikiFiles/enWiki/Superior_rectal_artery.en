The '''superior rectal artery''' ('''superior hemorrhoidal artery''') is an artery that descends into the [[pelvis]] to supply blood to the [[rectum]].

==Structure==
The superior rectal artery is the continuation of the [[inferior mesenteric artery]].  It descends into the [[pelvis]] between the layers of the [[mesentery]] of the [[sigmoid colon]], crossing the left [[common iliac artery]] and vein. 

It divides, opposite the third [[sacral vertebra]] into two branches, which descend one on either side of the [[rectum]].  About 10 or 12 cm from the [[anus]], these branches break up into several small branches. 

These pierce the muscular coat of the bowel and run downward, as straight vessels, placed at regular intervals from each other in the wall of the gut between its muscular and mucous coats, to the level of the [[internal anal sphincter]]; here they form a series of loops around the lower end of the rectum, and communicate with the [[middle rectal artery]] (from the [[internal iliac artery]]) and with the [[inferior rectal artery]] (from the [[internal pudendal artery]]).
