'''Total iron-binding capacity''' (TIBC) is a medical laboratory test that measures the blood's capacity to bind [[iron]] with [[transferrin]].<ref name="urlMedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Total iron binding capacity">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003489.htm |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Total iron binding capacity |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> It is performed by [[phlebotomy|drawing blood]] and measuring the maximum amount of iron that it can carry, which indirectly measures [[transferrin]]<ref name="pmid12507977">{{cite journal |author=Yamanishi H, Iyama S, Yamaguchi Y, Kanakura Y, Iwatani Y |title=Total iron-binding capacity calculated from serum transferrin concentration or serum iron concentration and unsaturated iron-binding capacity |journal=Clin.

The TIBC should not be confused with the UIBC, or "unsaturated iron binding capacity" ({{LOINC|22753-8}} and {{LOINC|35216-1}}). The UIBC is calculated by subtracting the serum iron from the TIBC. <ref name="urlIron Transport">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/hi11a.htm |title=Iron Transport |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref>

==Interpretation==
Taken together with [[serum iron]] and [[percent transferrin saturation]] clinicians usually perform this test when they are concerned about [[anemia]], [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] or [[iron deficiency anemia]]. However, because the [[liver]] produces transferrin, alterations in function (such as [[cirrhosis]], [[hepatitis]], or [[liver failure]]) must be considered when performing this test. It can also be an indirect test of liver function, but is rarely used for this purpose.

The percent transferrin saturation (i.e., the result of the formula of serum iron/TIBC x 100) can also be a useful indicator. 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Condition
! [[Serum iron]]
! Transferrin and TIBC 
! [[Percent transferrin saturation]]
|-
| [[iron deficiency anemia]]
| Low
| High. The [[liver]] produces more transferrin, presumably attempting to maximize use of the little iron that is available.
| Low, as there is insufficient iron.
|-
| [[anemia of chronic disease]]
| Low, as the body holds iron intracellularly with [[ferritin]].
| Low. The body produces less transferrin (but more ferritin), presumably to keep iron away from [[pathogen]]s that require it for their metabolism. This is mainly regulated by increased [[hepcidin]] production.
| Normal
|-
| [[pregnancy]] or use of [[hormonal contraception]], but without iron deficiency 
| Normal
| High. The liver increases the production of transferrin, thus raising TIBC.
| Low, as there is excess transferrin with normal serum iron levels.

These examples demonstrate that to properly understand a value for TIBC, one also must know the serum iron, the percent transferrin saturation, and the individual clinical situation.

==Usual values==
[[File:Blood values sorted by mass and molar concentration.png|thumb|450px|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]], comparing blood content of iron and related compounds (shown in brown and orange) with other constituents.]]

Normal [[Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests#Electrolytes_and_Metabolites|reference range]]s are:
* [[Serum iron]]: Male 65–177 μg/dL (11.6–31.7 μmol/L); Female 50–170 μg/dL  (9.0–30.4 μmol/L)
* TIBC: 250–370 μg/dL  (45-66 μmol/L)<ref name="HarrisonPrinciples">Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 17th Edition (2008). Pg. 2432 (Table 351-2)</ref>
* [[Transferrin saturation]]: Male 20–50%; Female 15–50%
* Serum ferritin: Male 20-250 μg/L, Female 15-150 μg/L<ref name="HarrisonPrinciples" />

μg/dL = micrograms per deciliter; μmol/L = micromoles per litre.

Laboratories often use different units and "normal" may vary by population and the lab techniques used. Look at the individual laboratory [[reference values]] to interpret a specific test (for instance, your own).
