In [[anatomy]], '''Zenker's diverticulum''', also '''pharyngoesophageal diverticulum''', also '''pharyngeal pouch''', also '''hypopharyngeal diverticulum''', is a [[diverticulum]] of the [[mucosa]] of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], just above the [[cricopharyngeal muscle]] (i.e. above the upper [[sphincter]] of the [[esophagus]]). It is a false diverticulum (not involving all layers of the esophageal wall).

It was named in 1877 by [[Germany|German]] [[pathologist]] [[Friedrich Albert von Zenker]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2461}}</ref><ref>F. A. Zenker and Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen. Krankheiten des Oesophagus. Leipzig, 1867. </ref>

== Epidemiology ==

Zenker's diverticulum mainly affects older adults.

== Mechanisms and manifestations ==

In simple words, when there is excessive pressure within the lower [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the weakest portion of the pharyngeal wall balloons out, forming a [[diverticulum]] which may reach several centimetres in diameter.

More precisely, while traction and pulsion mechanisms have long been deemed the main factors promoting development of a Zenker's diverticulum, current consensus considers occlusive mechanisms to be most important: uncoordinated swallowing, impaired relaxation and spasm of the [[cricopharyngeus]] muscle lead to an increase in pressure within the distal pharynx, so that its wall herniates through the point of least resistance (variously known as [[Killian's triangle]], Laimer's triangle, and the Killian-Laimer triangle). The result is an outpouching of the posterior pharyngeal wall, just above the oesophagus, specifically just above the cricopharyngeal muscle.<ref name="pmid12903677">{{cite journal |author=van Overbeek JJ |title=Pathogenesis and methods of treatment of Zenker's diverticulum |journal=Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. |volume=112 |issue=7 |pages=583–93 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12903677 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

While it may be asymptomatic, Zenker diverticulum often causes clinical manifestations such as [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing),  and sense of a lump in the neck; moreover, it may fill up with food, causing [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]] (reappearance of ingested food in the mouth), [[cough]] (as some food may be regurgitated into the airways), [[halitosis]] (smelly breath, as stagnant food is digested by microrganisms), potential infection of the pharyngeal areas due to food stuck, and involuntary gurgling noises when swallowing. It rarely, if ever, causes any pain.

Cervical webs are seen associated in 50% of patients with this condition.

== Diagnosis ==

A simple [[barium swallow]] will normally reveal the [[diverticulum]]. [[Endoscopy]] should not be performed due to the risk of perforating the diverticulum.

== Treatment ==

If small and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Larger, symptomatic cases of Zenker's diverticulum have been traditionally treated by neck [[surgery]] to resect the [[diverticulum]] and incise the [[cricopharyngeus]] muscle. However, in recent times non-surgical endoscopic techniques have gained more importance (as they allow for much faster recovery), and the currently preferred treatment is endoscopic stapling<ref name="pmid15453934">{{cite journal |author=Sen P, Bhattacharyya AK |title=Endoscopic stapling of pharyngeal pouch |journal=J Laryngol Otol |volume=118 |issue=8 |pages=601–6 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15453934 |doi=10.1258/0022215041917817 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid12782805">{{cite journal |author=Chang CY, Payyapilli RJ, Scher RL |title=Endoscopic staple diverticulostomy for Zenker's diverticulum: review of literature and experience in 159 consecutive cases |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=957–65 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12782805 |doi= 10.1097/00005537-200306000-00009|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0023-852X&volume=113&issue=6&spage=957}}</ref> (i.e. closing off the diverticulum via a stapler inserted through a tube in the mouth).

Other non-surgical treatment modalities exist, such as endoscopic laser, which recent evidence suggests is less effective than stapling.<ref name="pmid16954989">{{cite journal |author=Miller FR, Bartley J, Otto RA |title=The endoscopic management of Zenker diverticulum: CO2 laser versus endoscopic stapling |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=116 |issue=9 |pages=1608–11 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16954989 |doi=10.1097/01.mlg.0000233508.06499.41 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?doi=10.1097/01.mlg.0000233508.06499.41}}</ref>
