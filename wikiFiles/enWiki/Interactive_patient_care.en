'''Interactive patient care''' (IPC) refers to an approach in health care that puts the emphasis on providing entertainment and educational resources to the patient bedside via the in-room TV.  However, momentum is growing for IPC to include more patient-facing interfaces such as mobile, [[Smart TV]], and social applications as well as the self-service [[patient portal]].  This evolution of IPC expands the engagement footprint beyond the bedside to include the entire continuum of a patient's care - primarily adding the home.  These technologies can provide interactive services that are personalized to the patientâ€™s condition and provide healthcare workers with patient education, [[pain assessment]] and medication teaching. IPC solutions can also integrate with traditional [[Electronic health record|EMR]] and hospital IT systems such as Cerner, McKesson, and GE Healthcare, for example, but are more directly patient-centric applications, whose delivery helps hospitals meet service and quality requirements.  In light of [[meaningful use]], it is also speculated that providing IPC through multiple technology modes will help US hospitals reach their 5% patient-utilization requirement expected in 2014.<ref>http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/Stage2Overview_Tipsheet.pdf</ref>

Interactive Patient Care improves the satisfaction and outcomes for both the patient and hospital.
