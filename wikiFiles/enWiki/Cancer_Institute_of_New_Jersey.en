The '''Cancer Institute of New Jersey''' ('''CINJ''') is a cancer treatment and research institution in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]]. CINJ is one of only 41 [[Comprehensive Cancer Center]]s in the nation designated by the [[National Cancer Institute]] and the only one in New Jersey.

The Cancer Institute of New Jersey is a center of excellence of [[UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]] and is located adjacent to [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]], its primary clinical affiliate. CINJ delivers comprehensive cancer care to both adults and children and conducts laboratory, clinical, prevention, and population research. Laboratory research at CINJ is supported by more than $99 million annually in cancer-related research grants. CINJ manages more than 80,000 patient visits annually.

Recent additions to the facility have tripled the square footage to {{convert|225000|sqft|m2}}, and the patient care setting was reconfigured to give it the feel of a much smaller institution.  CINJ provides a Resource and Learning Center, where patients and their families can review the latest information on advanced therapies and new clinical trials. 

The director of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey is Robert S. DiPaola, MD.
