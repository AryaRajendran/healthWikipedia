A '''Finnish heritage disease''' is a genetic disease or disorder that is significantly more common in people whose ancestors were ethnic [[Finns]], natives of [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].  About 40 [[rare disease]]s are regarded as Finnish heritage diseases.<ref name="pmid12627297">{{cite journal

Three rare causes of [[dwarfism]] are included in the Finnish heritage:  [[cartilage-hair hypoplasia]], [[diastrophic dysplasia]] and [[Mulibrey nanism]].

Four genetically distinct subtypes of [[neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis]] are found in the Finnish heritage:  [[CLN1]], [[CLN3]], [[CLN5]], and [[CLN8]].<ref name=Batten>{{cite book

==Other genetic diseases==
The [[European Organization for Rare Diseases]] (EURORDIS) estimates that there are between 5,000 and 7,000 distinct rare diseases, affecting between 6% and 8% of the population of the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.eurordis.org/IMG/pdf/princeps_document-EN.pdf | title=Rare Diseases: Understanding This Public Health Priority | publisher= European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) | date= November 2005 | accessdate=16 May 2009}}</ref>  The majority of genetic diseases reported in Finland are not part of the Finnish disease heritage and their prevalence is not higher in Finland than worldwide.

Some genetic diseases are disproportionately rare in Finns.  These include [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[phenylketonuria]].  In Finland, about 1 in 80 persons are carriers of a cystic fibrosis mutation, compared with an average of 1 in 25 elsewhere in Europe.<ref name="pmid11813900">{{cite journal
