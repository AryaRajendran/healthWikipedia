In [[medicine]] '''pulmonary artery catheterization''' (PAC) is the insertion of a [[catheter]] into a [[pulmonary artery]]. Its purpose is [[Diagnosis|diagnostic]]; it is used to detect [[heart failure]] or [[sepsis]], monitor therapy, and evaluate the [[Causality|effects]] of [[medication|drugs]].  The pulmonary artery catheter allows direct, simultaneous measurement of pressures in the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and the filling pressure ("wedge" pressure) of the left atrium.

The pulmonary artery catheter is frequently referred to as a '''Swan-Ganz catheter''', in honor of its inventors [[Jeremy Swan]] and [[William Ganz]], from [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]]. The idea for a sail or balloon tip modification of Ronald Bradley's simple portex tubing method came about from Dr Swan's observation from the Santa Monica shore of sail boats on the water on a relatively calm day. Boats with conventional slot sails were still; one with a [[spinnaker]] was able to make reasonable headway. The concept of using thermodilution to measure cardiac output was originally the idea of Arnost Fronek MD, PhD of the Cardiovascular Institute in Prague.  As a former colleague of Fronek, Ganz added the [[thermistor]] modification after Swan showed him the initial balloon design, which was fabricated by Edwards Laboratories, which had previously contracted with Swan as a consultant.

==Indications==
General indications are:
*Management of complicated [[myocardial infarction]]
**Hypovolemia vs [[cardiogenic shock]]
**Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) vs acute mitral regurgitation
**Severe left ventricular failure
**Right ventricular infarction
**Unstable angina
**Refractory ventricular [[tachycardia]]
*Assessment of respiratory distress
**Cardiogenic vs non-cardiogenic [[pulmonary edema]]
**Primary vs secondary [[pulmonary hypertension]]
*Assessment of type of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]
*Assessment of therapy
**[[Afterload]] reduction
**Vasopressors
**[[Beta blocker]]s
**Intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation
*Assessment of fluid requirement in critically ill patients
**Hemorrhage
**Sepsis
**[[Acute renal failure]] aka Acute Kidney Injury
**Burns
*Management of postoperative open heart surgical patients
*Assessment of valvular [[heart disease]]
*Assessment of cardiac tamponade/constriction

Note: No study has definitively demonstrated improved outcome in critically ill patients managed with PA catheters.<ref>JAMA 2005 Oct 5;294(13):1664-70.</ref> Therefore, the primary justification has been on the basis of clinic experience.

==Procedure==
[[File:Sganz.jpg|thumb|350px|ECG and pressure readings obtained from a Swan-Ganz catheter at different positions.]]
The catheter is introduced through a large vein&mdash;often the [[internal jugular vein|internal jugular]], [[subclavian vein|subclavian]], or [[femoral vein|femoral]] veins.  From this entry site, it is threaded, often with the aid of [[fluoroscopy]], through the right [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]] of the [[heart]], the right [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], and subsequently into the pulmonary artery.

The standard pulmonary artery catheter has two lumens (Swan-Ganz) and is equipped with an inflatable [[balloon]] at the tip, which facilitates its placement into the pulmonary artery through the flow of blood.  The balloon, when inflated, causes the catheter to "wedge" in a small pulmonary blood vessel.  So wedged, the catheter can provide an indirect measurement of the pressure in the left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] of the heart, showing a mean pressure, in addition to a, x, v, and y waves which have implications for status of the left atria and the mitral valve.  [[Left ventricular end diastolic pressure]] ([[LVedp]]) is measured using a different procedure, with a catheter that has directly crossed the [[aortic valve]] and is well positioned in the left ventricle.  LV edp reflects fluid status of the individual in addition to heart health.  See also [[pulmonary wedge pressure]] and [[ventricular pressure]].

== Technical developments ==

=== Thermal dilution ===

After Swan developed the initial balloon tip, Ganz used Fronek's idea and added a small [[thermistor]] (temperature probe) about 3&nbsp;cm behind the tip. Either cold 10 ml of saline (0.9% NaCl) under 10° Celsius or room temperature (not as accurate) is injected into an opening in the [[right atrium]]. As this cooler fluid passes the tip thermistor, a very brief drop in the blood temperature is recorded. A recent variation in design is the incorporation of a heating coil on  the catheter (30&nbsp;cm from the tip, residing in the atrium area) which  eliminates the cold fluid bolus, a major factor in human technique  variation.

By attaching both the injector site and the ventricular thermistor to a small computer, the thermodilution curve can be plotted. If details about the patient's body mass index (size); core temp, Systolic, diastolic, central venous pressure CVP (measured from the atrium by the third lumen simultaneously) and pulmonary artery pressure are input, a comprehensive flow vs pressure map can be calculated.

In crude terms, this measurement compares left and right cardiac activity and calculates [[preload]] and [[afterload]] flow and pressures which theoretically if stabilized or adjusted with drugs to either constrict or dilate the vessels to raise or lower the pressure of blood flow to the lungs, respectively, in order to maximize oxygen for delivery to the body tissues. 

The ability to record results is not a guarantee of patient  survivability. The true art remains with the consultant physician or [[intensivist]] in balancing fluid load, so much so that the introduction of a balloon catheter, which is usually yellow, has been nicknamed "The kiss of the yellow snake".

=== Pharmacotherapy lumens ===

Modern catheters have multiple [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]s — five or six are common — and have openings along the  length to allow administration of [[inotrope]]s and other drugs directly into the  atrium.  Drugs to achieve these changes can be delivered into the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]] via the fourth lumen, usually dedicated to medication. Common drugs used are various [[inotrope]]s, [[norepinephrine]] or even [[atropine]]. A further set of calculations can be made by measuring the arterial blood and central venous (from the third lumen) and inputting these figures into a spreadsheet or the cardiac output computer, if so equipped, and plotting an oxygen delivery profile.

=== SvO<sub>2</sub> measurement ===

One further development in recent years has been the invention of a catheter with a fiber-optic based probe which is extended and lodged into the ventricle wall providing instant readings of SvO2 or oxygen saturation of the ventricle tissues. This technique has a finite life as the sensor becomes coated with protein and it can irritate the ventricle via the contact area.

=== Alternatives ===

Various other techniques have largely relegated the PA catheter to history, e.g. the [[lithium dilution technique]]; the [[external bio-resistance monitor]] or the very simple and reliable technique of [[esophogeal doppler]] measurements of the descending aorta.

==Complications==
The procedure is not without risk, and complications can be life threatening.  It can lead to [[arrhythmias]], rupture of the pulmonary artery, [[thrombosis]], [[infection]], [[pneumothorax]], [[bleeding]], and other problems.

==Controversy==
The benefit of the use of this type of catheter has been controversial.  Therefore many clinicians minimize its use{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. .

===Evidence of benefit===
Several studies in the 1980s seemed to show a benefit of the increase in physiological information. Many reports showing benefit of the PA catheter are from anaesthetic, and Intensive Care settings. In these settings cardiovascular performance was optimized thinking patients would have supra-normal metabolic requirements.

===Evidence of harm or lack of benefit===
Contrary to earlier studies there is growing evidence the use of a PA catheter (PAC) does not necessarily lead to improved outcome.<ref name="urlNEJM -- A Randomized, Controlled Trial of the Use of Pulmonary-Artery Catheters in High-Risk Surgical Patients">{{cite web |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/348/1/5 |title=NEJM -- A Randomized, Controlled Trial of the Use of Pulmonary-Artery Catheters in High-Risk Surgical Patients |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The following explanations have been advanced. One explanation could be that nurses and physicians were insufficiently knowledgeable to adequately interpret the PA catheter measurements. Also, the benefits might be reduced by the complications from the use of the PAC. Furthermore, using information from the PAC might result in a more aggressive therapy causing the detrimental effect. Or, it could give rise to more harmful therapies (i.e. achieving supra-normal values could be associated with increased mortality).

===Utility of Pulmonary Artery Catheterization===
This interpretation of [[Adolph Fick]]s' formulation for [[Cardiac Output]] by time/temperature curves is an expedient but limited and invasive model of right heart performance. It remains an exceptional method of monitoring volume overload leading to pulmonary edema in an ICU setting.

Noninvasive [[Echocardiography]] and pulse-wave cardiac output monitoring are concordant with (and much safer) if not better than invasive methods defining right and left heart performance. The advent of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and similar hospital based catheter infections now clearly limits the utility of this type of invasive cardiac ICU intervention.
