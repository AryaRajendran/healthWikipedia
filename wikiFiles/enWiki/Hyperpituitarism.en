'''Hyperpituitarism''' is the primary hypersecretion of pituitary hormones. It typically results from a [[pituitary adenoma]]. Most pituitary adenomas are functional and secrete a hormone that produces clear symptoms characteristic of their condition<ref name="Colao">Colao, A, Loche, S, Cappabianca, P. Pituitary adenomas in children and adolescents. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapeutic strategies. The Endocrinologist. 2000;10:314-27.</ref>. In children with hyperpituitarism, disruption of growth regulation and/or sexual maturation is common, either because of hormone hypersecretion or because of manifestations caused by local compression of the adenoma. Pituitary adenomas are rare in children, accounting for only 3-6% of all adenomas, whereas they comprise 30% of adenomas in adults.

There are three hormones that are oversecreted resulting in the pituitary adenoma: [[prolactin]], [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), and [[growth hormone]] (GH) <ref name="Diaz">Diaz-Thomas, A., Shim, M. Hyperpituitarism. Medscape Reference. WebMD. 2012.[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/921568-overview]</ref>. 

Excess prolactin may result in a [[prolactinoma]]. The symptoms may vary, depending on the age and sex of the child. Prepubertal children typically experience a combination of headaches, visual disturbance, and growth failure. Pubertal females frequently have symptoms of pubertal arrest or [[hypogonadism]] due to suppression of [[gonadotropin]] secretion or local compression of the pituitary. Pubertal males may have symptoms of headaches, visual impairment, and pubertal arrest or growth failure<ref>Ciccarelli, A, Daly, AF, Beckers, A. The epidemiology of prolactinomas. Pituitary. 2005;8:3-6.</ref>. 

Excess ACTH commonly results in weight gain. [[Hirsutism]] and premature [[adrenarche]] may occur in prepubertal children. Pubertal arrest, acne, fatigue, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] are also common<ref name="Colao" />. 	

Excess GH results in [[gigantism]]. The severity of gigantism depends on whether the [[epiphyseal plate]] is open. Before epiphyseal fusion, accelerated growth velocity is prominent. As epiphyseal fusion approaches, the spectrum of symptoms resembles that in adults (eg, coarsening of facial features, change in ring and shoe size)<ref>Colao, A, Lombardi, G. Growth-hormone and prolactin excess. Lancet. Oct 31 1998;352(9138):1455-61.</ref>.

The four most common types of hyperpituitarism are prolactinoma, corticotropinoma ([[Cushing's disease]]), somatotropinoma (gigantism), and thyrotropinoma (a rare pituitary cancer)<ref name="Diaz" />.


==Clinical manifestations==
Depending on the cell type(s) affected, clinical manifestations of hormone excess may include:
*[[Hyperprolactinaemia]]
*[[Cushing's disease]]
*[[Precocious puberty]]
*[[Gigantism]] or [[Acromegaly]]
*[[Hyperthyroidism]] (rare)

==Associated conditions==
When there is an enlargement of the pituitary tissue, hyperpituitarism is often associated with:
*[[Visual field]] defects, classically [[Bitemporal hemianopsia|bitemporal hemianopia]]
*Radiographic abnormalities of the [[sella turcica]], such as sellar expansion, bony erosion and disuption of the [[diaphragma sellae]]
*[[Intracranial pressure#Increased ICP|Increased intracranial pressure]]

==Symptoms==
Symptoms caused by hormone excess and associated mass effects include:
*[[Headache]]
*Visual field loss or [[Diplopia|Double vision]]
*[[Excessive sweating]]
*[[Hoarseness]]
*Milk secretion from [[breast]]
*[[Sleep apnea]]
*[[Carpal tunnel syndrome]]
*[[Joint pain]] and limitation of motion
*[[Muscle weakness]]
*[[Numbness]] or [[tingling of skin]]
*[[Parathyroid hormone|Elevated PTH level]]
