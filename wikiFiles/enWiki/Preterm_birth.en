In humans '''preterm birth''' ({{lang-la|partus praetemporaneus}} or {{lang|la|''partus praematurus''}}) is the [[birth]] of a [[baby]] of less than 37 weeks [[gestational age]].   The cause of preterm birth is in many situations elusive and unknown; many factors appear to be associated with the development of preterm birth, making the reduction of preterm birth a challenging proposition.

'''Premature birth''' is defined either as the same as preterm birth, or the birth of a baby before the developing organs are mature enough to allow normal postnatal survival. Premature infants are at greater risk for short and long term complications, including disabilities and impediments in growth and mental development. Significant progress has been made in the care of premature infants, but not in reducing the [[prevalence]] of preterm birth.<ref name=Goldenberg2008/> Preterm birth is among the top causes of death in infants worldwide.<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/index.html</ref>

Infants who were born prematurely are colloquially referred to as "preemies"<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/preemie
</ref> or "premmies."
==Classification==

In humans the usual definition of preterm birth is birth before a [[gestational age]] of 37 complete weeks.<ref name=Steer2005>

}}</ref> In the normal human fetus, several organ systems mature between 34 and 37 weeks, and the fetus reaches adequate maturity by the end of this period. One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days/weeks of their life on a [[ventilator]]. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature.  Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate surfactant, which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.

== Signs and symptoms of preterm labor ==
The main categories of causes of preterm birth are preterm [[labor induction]] and spontaneous preterm [[Childbirth|labor]]. Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine [[Contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]s in one hour. In contrast to [[false labor]], true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and [[Cervical effacement|effacement]]. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection ([[chorioamnionitis]]) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.

== Risk factors ==
As the cause of labor still remains elusive, the exact cause of preterm birth is also unsolved. In fact, the cause of 50% of preterm births is never determined. Labor is a complex process involving many factors. Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension (placental abruption), decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection.<ref name=Simham2007>

==Diagnosis==
A helpful clinical test should predict a high risk for preterm birth during the early and middle part of the third trimester, when their impact is significant. Many women experience false labor (not leading to cervical shortening and effacement) and are falsely labeled to be in preterm labor. The study of preterm birth has been hampered by the difficulty in distinguishing between "true" preterm labor and false labor.<ref name=Simham2007/> These new tests are used to identify women at risk for preterm birth.

===Fetal fibronectin===
[[Fetal fibronectin]] has become the most important biomarker—the presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that the border between the chorion and deciduas has been disrupted. A positive test indicates an increased risk of preterm birth, and a negative test has a high predictive value.<ref name=Goldenberg2008/>  It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative.<ref>

===Ultrasonography of the cervix===
[[Obstetric ultrasound]] has become useful in the assessment of the cervix in women at risk for premature delivery. A short cervix preterm is undesirable: At 24 weeks gestation a cervix length of less than 25&nbsp;mm defines a risk group for preterm birth. Further, the shorter the cervix the greater the risk.<ref>

==Prevention==
Historically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Increasingly primary interventions that are directed at all women, and secondary intervention that reduce existing risks are looked upon as measures that need to be developed and implemented to prevent the health problems of premature infants and children.<ref name=Iams2008>

Self-monitoring vaginal pH followed by yogurt treatment or clindamycin treatment if the pH was too high all seem to be effective at reducing the risk of preterm birth.<ref>

===Secondary (reducing existing risks)===
Women are identified to be at increased risk for preterm birth on the basis of their past obstetrical history or the presence of known risk factors. Preconception intervention can be helpful in selected patients in a number of ways. Patients with certain uterine anomalies may have a surgical correction (i.e. removal of a [[uterine septum]]), and those with certain medical problems can be helped by optimizing medical therapies prior to conception, be it for asthma, diabetes, hypertension and others.

====During pregnancy====
=====Reducing indicated preterm birth=====
A number of agents have been studied for secondary prevention of indicated preterm birth. Trials using low-dose [[aspirin]],  [[fish oil]], vitamin C and E, and calcium to reduce preeclampsia demonstrated some reduction in preterm birth only when low-dose aspirin was used.<ref name=Iams2008/> Interestingly, even if agents such as calcium or [[antioxidant]]s were able to reduce preeclampsia, a resulting decrease in preterm birth was not observed.<ref name=Iams2008/>

=====Reducing spontaneous preterm birth=====
Reduction in maternal activity – pelvic rest, limited work, bed rest – is frequently recommended although there is no clear proof of its efficacy. Also, increasing medical care by more frequent visits and more education has not shown a reduction in preterm birth rates.<ref>

==Complications==
===Mortality and morbidity===
The shorter the term of pregnancy, the greater the risks of mortality and [[morbidity]] for the baby primarily due to the related prematurity. Preterm-premature babies ("preemies" or "premmies") have an increased risk of death in the first year of life ([[infant mortality]]), with most of that occurring in the first month of life ([[neonatal mortality]]). Worldwide, prematurity accounts for 10% of neonatal mortality, or around 500,000 deaths per year.<ref>

Tertiary interventions are aimed at women who are about to go into preterm labor, or rupture the membranes or bleed preterm. The use of the [[Fetal_fibronectin|fibronectin test]] and ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and reduces false-positive diagnosis. While treatments to arrest early labor where there is progressive cervical dilatation and effacement will not be effective to gain sufficient time to allow the fetus to grow and mature further, it may defer delivery sufficiently to allow the mother to be brought to a specialized center that is equipped and staffed to handle preterm deliveries.<ref>

In a hospital setting women are hydrated via intravenous infusion (as dehydration can lead to premature uterine contractions).

===Glucocorticosteroids===
Severely premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs, because they are not yet producing their own [[surfactant]]. This can lead directly to [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], also called hyaline membrane disease, in the neonate. To try to reduce the risk of this outcome, pregnant mothers with threatened premature delivery prior to 34 weeks are often administered at least one course of [[glucocorticoids]], a steroid that crosses the placental barrier and stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs of the fetus. Typical glucocorticoids that would be administered in this context are [[betamethasone]] or [[dexamethasone]], often when the fetus has reached [[viability (fetus)|viability]] at 23 weeks. In cases where premature birth is imminent, a second "rescue" course of steroids may be administered 12 to 24 hours before the anticipated birth. There is no research consensus on the efficacy and side-effects of a second course of steroids, but the consequences of RDS are so severe that a second course is often viewed as worth the risk. Beside reducing respiratory distress, other neonatal complications are reduced by the use of glucocorticosteroids, namely intraventricular haemorrhage, [[necrotising enterocolitis]], and [[patent ductus arteriosus]].<ref>

Despite being used for over 50 years to treat respiratory distress syndrome, glucocorticosteroid therapy is still controversial. Much of this concern is based on when these steroids should be administered (i.e. prenatally or postnatally) or for how long (i.e. acutely or chronically). For instance, clinical research conducted in 2004 has shown that the postnatal administration of dexamethasone can lead to permanent neuromotor and [[cognitive deficits]].<ref>

===Neonatal care===
In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in a [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU). The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as [[neonatology|neonatologists]]. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in [[neonatal incubator|incubator]]s (also called isolettes), which are [[bassinet]]s enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]], and [[Electroencephalography|brain activity]]. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] catheters, [[oxygen]] supplementation, [[mechanical ventilation]] support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as ''[[kangaroo care]]'' (skin to skin warming), encouraging [[breastfeeding]], and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm [[morbidity]] and mortality.  [[Bili light]]s may also be used to treat newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia).

Prophylactic treatments are also used to care for preterm infants. For example, indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) is commonly used to help with the closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A recent study on extremely premature infants (23-24 weeks) treated prophylactically with indomethacin within 6 hours of life showed a relative risk reduction (RRR) of developing symptomatic PDA (bounding pulses, wide pulse pressure, pulmonary congestion) to be 100%  when compared to infants who were not given indomethacin until ductus-related signs were observed. In addition, infants treated prophylactically also showed a 50% RRR of severe intraventricular hemorrhage and 100% RRR of other major complications (pulmonary hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, etc.) when compared to the patient controls. <ref>Yoshimoto S, Sakai H, Ueda M, Mayumi Y, Mizobuchi M, Naka H.

==Ethics==

The transformation of medical care means that extremely premature and very ill babies have better chances of survival than ever before. But it is difficult to predict which babies will die and which will live, though possibly with severe disabilities. As a consequence, families and health professionals have to make complex decisions about how much intervention is necessary or justifiable. 

The most difficult decisions are about whether or not to resuscitate a premature baby and admit him or her to neonatal intensive care, or whether to withdraw intensive care and give the child palliative care.

This is discussed at great length in a report "Critical care decisions in fetal and neonatal medicine: ethical issues"<ref>

In the UK, the debate regarding resuscitation of babies born at 23 weeks was highlighted by Dr Daphne Austin, an NHS official who advised local health authorities on how to spend their budgets in 2011. She argued that babies born at 23 weeks should not be resuscitated because their chances of surviving are so slim and that there is sufficient evidence that keeping the babies alive can do more harm than good. UK official guidelines for pre-term babies state that medics should not attempt to resuscitate babies born before 22 weeks, as they are too under developed. Babies born between 22 and 25 weeks should be given intensive care as routine.

As a result of this decision, when Sarah Capewell gave live birth to her son at 21 weeks 5 days gestation, the baby boy was denied treatment. According to the mother, he was breathing unaided, had a strong heartbeat, and was even moving his arms and legs.  If he had been born two days later, they would have treated him.  However, untreated, he died within two hours of birth.  This took place at James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk, in October 2008.
