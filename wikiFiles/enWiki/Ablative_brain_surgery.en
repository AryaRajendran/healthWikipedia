'''Ablative brain surgery''' (also known as brain lesioning) is the [[surgery|surgical]] [[ablation]] by various methods of [[brain]] tissue to treat [[neurological disorder|neurological]] or [[psychological disorder|psychological]] disorders. The [[lesion]]s it causes are irreversible. There are some target nuclei for ablative surgery and deep brain stimulation. Those nuclei are the motor thalamus, the globus pallidus, and the subthalamic nucleus.<ref>Starr, Philip A. Md, Nov 1998 volume 43 http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/1998/11000/Ablative_Surgery_and_Deep_Brain_Stimulation_for.1.aspx</ref>
Ablative brain surgery was first introduced by Pierre Flourens (1774–1867), a French physiologist. He removed different parts of the nervous system from animals and observed what effects were caused by the removal of certain parts. For example, if an animal could not move its arm after a certain part was removed, it was assumed that the region would control arm movements. The method of removal of part of the brain was termed "experimental ablation". With the use of experimental ablation, Flourens claimed to find the area of the brain that controlled heart rate and breathing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New Jersey, United States|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=13}}</ref>
Ablative brain surgery is also often used as a research tool in [[neurobiology]]. For example, by ablating specific brain regions and observing differences in animals subjected to behavioral  tests, the functions of all the removed areas may be inferred.
Experimental ablation is used in research on animals. Such research is considered unethical on humans due to the irreversible effects and damages caused by the lesion and by the ablation of brain tissues. However, these effects of brain lesions (caused by accidents or diseases) on behavior can be observed to draw conclusions on the functions of different parts of the brain.<ref>Carlson, N.R. (1999).

===Parkinson's disease===

Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed in the area of the basal ganglia, as it is a  progressive degenerative disease. Pathologically, it is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra, pars compacta (SNc).<ref>((Starr, Philip A. MD, PhD; Vitek, Jerrold L. MD, PhD; Bakay, Roy A.E. MD. 1998. Departments of Neurosurgery (PAS, RAEB) and Neurology (JLV), Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. Abliative Surgery and Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease.  43(5):989-1013))</ref> Surgical ablation has been used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]]. In the 1990s, the [[pallidum]] was a common surgical target. Unilateral pallidotomy improves [[tremor]] and [[dyskinesia]] on one side of the body (opposite the side of the brain surgery), but bilateral pallidotomy was found to cause irreversible deterioration in [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[cognition]]. There are two other potential rapidly evolving surgical approaches to Parkinson's disease such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and restorative therapies.<ref name="StarrPhilip">(Starr, Philip A. MD, PhD; Vitek, Jerrold L. MD, PhD; Bakay, Roy A.E. MD. 1998. Departments of Neurosurgery (PAS, RAEB) and Neurology (JLV), Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. Abliative Surgery and Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease.  43(5):989-1013))</ref> The [[thalamus]] is another potential target for treating a tremor; in some countries, so is the [[subthalamic nucleus]], although not in the [[United States]] due to its severe side effects. Stimulation of portions of the Thalamus or lesioning has been used for various psychiatric and neurological conditions, and when practiced for movement disorders the target is in the motor nuclei of the thalamus. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Philip A|coauthors=Vitek, Jerrold L.; Bakey, Roy.|title=Ablative Surgery and Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease|journal=Neurosurgery|year=1998|month=November|volume=43|issue=5|pages=989–1013|doi=10.1097/00006123-199811000-00001|pmid=9802843}}</ref>  Deep brain stimulation is a surgical treatment involving the implantation of a medical device called a brain pacemaker, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain.

However, rigidity is not fully controlled after successful thalamotomy, it is replaced by hypotonia. Furthermore, significant complications can occur, for example, left ventral-lateral thalamotomy in a right-handed patient results in verbal deterioration while right thalamotomy causes visual-spatial defects.<ref>Laitinen LV: Ablative surgery and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease.

Patients who suffer from immunodeficiencies are an example of a situation in which DBS is not a suitable procedure. However, a major reason as to why DBS is not often performed is the cost. Because of its high cost, DBS cannot be performed in regions of the world that are not wealthy. In the case of such circumstances, a permanent lesion in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is created as it is a more favourable surgical procedure.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Ablative surgery for Parkinson disease |publisher= Nature Reviews Clinical Neurology|author= D. Yates}}</ref> The surgical procedure is going to be done on the non-dominant side of the brain; a lesion might be favored to evade numerous pacemaker replacements. More so, patients who gain relief from stimulation devoid of any side effects and need a pacemaker change may have a lesion performed on them in the same position. The stimulation parameters act as a guide for the preferred size of the lesion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siegfried|first=Jean|title=Ablative Surgery and Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease.[Review]|journal=Neurosurgery|year=1998|month=November|volume=43|issue=5|pages=1014–1015|doi=10.1097/00006123-199811000-00004}}</ref> In order to identify the part of the brain that is to be destroyed, new techniques such as micro electrode mapping have been developed.<ref>Okun, M.

The advent of deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been an important advance in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD). DBS may be employed in the management of medication-refractory tremor or treatment-related motor complications, and may benefit between 4.5% and 20% of patients at some stage of their disease course. DBS at high frequency often has behavioral effects that are similar to those of lesioning.In Australia, patients with PD are reviewed by specialised DBS teams who assess the likely benefits and risks associated with DBS for each individual.<ref name="StarrPhilip" /> The aim of these guidelines is to assist neurologists and general physicians identify patients who may benefit from referral to a DBS team. Common indications for referral are motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesias that are not adequately controlled with optimised medical therapy, medication-refractory tremor, and intolerance to medical therapy. Early referral for consideration of DBS is recommended as soon as optimised medical therapy fails to offer satisfactory motor control.<ref>Australian DBS Referral Guidelines Working Group. 2008.

===Cluster headaches===
[[Cluster headache]]s occur in cyclical patterns or clusters — which gives the condition of its name. Cluster headache is one of the most painful types of headache. Cluster headache is sometimes called the "alarm clock headache" because it commonly awakens you in the middle of the night with intense pain in or around the eye on one side of your head. The bouts of frequent attacks may last from weeks to months. When drug treatment fails, an invasive nerve stimulation procedure shows promise.{{fact|date=March 2013}}
[[Cluster headache]]s have been treated by ablation of the [[trigeminal nerve]], but have not been very effective. Other surgical treatments for cluster headaches are under investigation.<ref name="assfn newsletter">{{cite web |format= PDF |title= Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery News |url= http://www.assfn.org/society/Fall07newsletter.pdf |publisher= American Association of Neurological Surgeons |date= Fall 2007 |accessdate= 2008-05-01 }}</ref>

===Psychiatric disorders===
Ablative psychosurgery continues to be used in a few centres in various countries.<ref name="Sachdev">P.S. Sachdev and X. Chen 2009 Neurosurgical treatment of mood disorders: traditional psychosurgery and the advent of deep brain stimulation ''Current Opinion in Psychiatry'' '''22(1)''': 25-31.</ref> In the US there are a few centres including [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] that carry out ablative psychosurgical procedures.<ref>[http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/functional/psysurg.htm Massachusetts General Hospital Functional and Stereotactic Neurosurgery Center].</ref> Belgium,<ref name="Sachdev"/> the United Kingdom,<ref>K.

==Methods==
Experimental ablation involves the drilling of holes in the skull of an animal and inserting an electrode or a small tube called a cannula into the brain using a stereotaxic apparatus. A brain lesion can be created by conducting electricity through the electrode which damages the targeted area of the brain. likewise, chemicals can be inserted in the cannula which could possibly damages the area of interest. By comparing the prior behavior of the animal to after the lesion, the researcher can predict the function of damaged brain segment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New Jersey, United States|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=105}}</ref> Recently, [[laser]]s have been shown to be effective in ablation of both [[cerebrum|cerebral]] and [[cerebellum|cerebellar]] tissue. A laser technology called [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]-guided laser ablation,<ref name="StaffordAhrar2012">{{cite journal|last1=Stafford|first1=R. Jason|last2=Ahrar|first2=Kamran|title=Interventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging|year=2012|pages=253–269|issn=0942-5373|doi=10.1007/174_2012_629|chapter=MRI-Guided Thermal Ablation Techniques|series=Medical Radiology|isbn=978-3-642-20705-1}}</ref> for example, allows great precision in location and size of the lesion and the causes little to no thermal damage to adjacent tissue. The Texas Children's Hospital is one of the first to use this MRI guided method to destroy and treat brain lesions effectively and precisely. A prime example is a patient at this hospital who now no longer undergoes frequent seizures because of the success of this treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laser Ablation Surgery for Epilepsy|url=http://www.texaschildrens.org/epilepsylasersurgery/|accessdate=2012|publisher=Texas Children's Hospital}}</ref> MRI-guided laser ablation is also used for ablating brain, prostate and liver tumors. Heating or freezing are also alternative methods to ablative brain surgery.<ref>{{cite web|last=Samii|first=Ali|title=Stereotactic Surgery|url=http://www.waparkinsons.org/edu_research/articles/Stereotactic_Surgery.html|work=American Parkingson Disease Association, Washington Chapter|accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>
