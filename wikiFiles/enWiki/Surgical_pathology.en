'''Surgical pathology''' is the most significant and time-consuming area of practice for most [[anatomical pathology|anatomical pathologists]]. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of [[surgery|surgical]] specimens, as well as [[biopsy|biopsies]] submitted by surgeons and non-[[surgeon]]s such as [[internal medicine|general internists]], [[internal medicine|medical subspecialists]], [[dermatologist]]s, and [[interventional radiologist]]s. 

The practice of surgical pathology allows for definitive diagnosis of disease (or lack thereof) in any case where tissue is surgically removed from a patient. This is usually performed by a combination of gross (i.e., macroscopic) and [[histology|histologic]] (i.e., microscopic) examination of the tissue, and may involve evaluations of molecular properties of the tissue by [[immunohistochemistry]] or other laboratory tests. 

==Specimens==
There are two major types of specimens submitted for surgical pathology analysis: ''[[biopsy|biopsies]]'' and ''surgical resections.''  

A ''biopsy'' is a small piece of tissue removed primarily for the purposes of surgical pathology analysis, most often in order to render a definitive [[diagnosis]]. Types of biopsies include ''core biopsies'', which are obtained through the use of large-bore needles, sometimes under the guidance of radiological techniques such as [[ultrasound]], [[CT scan]], or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. Core biopsies, which preserve tissue architecture, should not be confused with [[fine needle aspiration]] specimens, which are analyzed using [[cytopathology]] techniques. ''Incisional biopsies'' are obtained through diagnostic surgical procedures that remove part of a suspicious lesion, whereas ''excisional biopsies'' remove the entire lesion, and are similar to therapeutic ''surgical resections.'' Excisional biopsies of skin lesions and gastrointestinal polyps are very common. The pathologist's interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis of a [[benign tumor|benign]] or [[cancer|malignant]] tumor, and can differentiate between different types and grades of [[cancer]], as well as determining the activity of specific molecular pathways in the tumor. This information is important for estimating the patient's [[prognosis]] and for choosing the best treatment to administer. Biopsies are also used to diagnose diseases other than cancer, including [[inflammation|inflammatory]], [[infection|infectious]], or [[idiopathic]] diseases of the [[skin]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]], to name only a few.  

''Surgical resection'' specimens are obtained by the therapeutic surgical removal of an entire diseased area or organ (and occasionally multiple organs). These procedures are often intended as definitive surgical treatment of a disease in which the diagnosis is already known or strongly suspected. However, pathological analysis of these specimens is critically important in confirming the previous diagnosis, [[staging]] the extent of malignant disease, establishing whether or not the entire diseased area was removed (a process called "determination of the [[surgical margin]]," often using [[frozen section]]), identifying the presence of unsuspected concurrent diseases, and providing information for postoperative treatment, such as [[adjuvant chemotherapy]] in the case of cancer.

In the determination of [[surgical margin]] of a surgical resection, one can use the [[bread loafing]] technique, or [[CCPDMA]].  A special type of CCPDMA is named after a general surgeon, or the [[Mohs surgery]] method.

Many pathologists seek fellowship-level training, or otherwise pursue expertise in a focused area of surgical pathology. Subspecialization is particularly prevalent in the academic setting, where pathologists may specialise in an area of diagnostic surgical pathology that is relevant to their research, but is becoming increasingly prevalent in private practice as well. Subspecialization has a number of benefits, such as allowing for increased experience and skill at interpreting challenging cases, as well as development of a closer working relationship between the pathologist and clinicians within a subspecialty area. Commonly recognized subspecialties of surgical pathology include the following:

*[[Bone pathology]]
*[[Cardiac pathology]]
*[[Cytopathology]] (A board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S.)
*[[Dermatopathology]] (A board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S.)
*[[Endocrine pathology]]
*[[Gastrointestinal pathology]]
*[[Genitourinary pathology]]
*[[Gynecologic pathology]]
*[[Head and Neck Pathology]]
*[[Hematopathology]] (A board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S.)
*[[Neuropathology]] (A board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S. and a recognised specialty in the U.K.)
*[[Ophthalmic pathology]]
*[[Pediatric pathology]] (A board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S. and a recognised specialty in the U.K.)
*[[Pulmonary pathology]]
*[[Renal pathology]]
*[[Soft tissue pathology]]
