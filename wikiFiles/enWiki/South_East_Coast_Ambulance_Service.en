The '''South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust''' (SECAmb) is the [[NHS Ambulance Services Trust]] for south-eastern [[England]], covering [[Kent]] (including [[Medway]]), [[Surrey]], [[West Sussex]] and [[East Sussex]] (including [[Brighton and Hove]]).  It also covers a part of north-eastern [[Hampshire]] around [[Aldershot]]. SECAmb was made a NHS Foundation Trust on 1 March 2011 - one of only two FTs in England. 

It is one of 12 [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|ambulance trusts]] providing England with [[emergency medical service]]s, and is part of the [[National Health Service]], receiving direct government funding for its role. There is no charge to patients for use of the service, and under the [[Patient's Charter]], every person in the United Kingdom has the right to the attendance of an ambulance in an emergency.

The service came in to being on 1 July 2006, with the merger of the former [[Kent Ambulance Service]], [[Surrey Ambulance Service]] and [[Sussex Ambulance Service]].

==About==
{{seealso|List of South East Coast Ambulance Service stations}}
The Chief Executive of the Trust is Paul Sutton, who was previously Chief Executive Officer of Sussex Ambulance Service. The Trust's Chair is Tony Thorne.

The Trust responds to [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] calls from the public and urgent calls from health professionals: in Kent and Sussex, it also provides non-emergency patient transport services (pre-booked patient journeys to and from health care facilities). In addition, the Trust provides the crews and maintains the three ambulances of the Neonatal Transfer Service for Kent, Surrey and Sussex.

It serves a population of around 4.5 million. During the last financial year (2005 / 2006) the three predecessor Trusts responded to about 460,000 emergency calls.

The ambulance region is served by two air ambulances operated by the Kent Air Ambulance Trust, the [[Kent Air Ambulance]], and the [[Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance]], which operate dedicated services.

In Sussex, this is supplemented by the Sussex Police Air Operations Unit, who run a helicopter jointly with SECAmb, called [[Sussex Police Air Operations Unit|Hotel 900]], which responds to both police and ambulance requests for assistance.
