{{Migraine}}

Preventive (also called [[prophylactic]]) treatment of migraines can be an important component of migraine management. Such treatments can take many forms, including everything from surgery, taking certain drugs or nutritional supplements, to lifestyle alterations such as increased exercise and avoidance of migraine triggers.

The goals of preventive therapy are to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.<ref name="AFP0601">{{cite journal | author = Modi S, Lowder D | title = Medications for migraine prophylaxis | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages =72–8 | year = 2006 | pmid =16417067}}</ref> Another reason to pursue these goals is to avoid [[medication overuse headache]] (MOH), otherwise known as [[rebound headache]], which is a common problem among migraneurs. This is believed to occur in part due to overuse of pain medications, and can result in chronic daily headache.<ref name="MOHlancet">{{cite journal | author = Diener H, Limmroth V | title = Medication-overuse headache: a worldwide problem | journal = The Lancet Neurology | volume = 3 | year=2004 | doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(04)00824-5 | pages=475–83 | pmid=15261608 | issue=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author =Fritsche G |coauthors=Diener HC | title = Medication overuse headaches — what is new? | journal =Expert Opin Drug Saf | volume =1 |issue =4 | year=2002 | month=November | pages=331–8 |pmid=12904133 |doi=10.1517/14740338.1.4.331 |url=http://www.informapharmascience.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14740338.1.4.331 }}</ref>

==Surgery==

There have been major [[pharmacological]] advances for the treatment of migraine headaches, yet patients must still endure symptoms until the medications take effect. Furthermore, often they still experience a poor quality of life despite an aggressive regimen of pharmacotherapy.<ref name="Jensen 2008">{{cite pmid|18339350}}</ref> [[Migraine surgery]] techniques have proven most effective in selected patients, often resulting in permanent migraine prevention. The most effective appear to be those involving the surgical cauterization of the superficial blood vessels of the scalp (the terminal branches of the external carotid artery),<ref>{{Cite journal

==Behavioral treatments==
Many physicians believe that [[exercise]] for 15–20 minutes per day is helpful for reducing the frequency of migraines.<ref>[http://www.headachedrugs.com/pdf/HA2005.pdf http://www.headachedrugs.com/]</ref>

Sleep is often a good solution if a migraine is not so severe as to prevent it, as when a person awakes the symptoms will have most likely subsided.

[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]], [[visualization (cam)|visualization]], and [[self-hypnosis]] are also alternative treatments and prevention approaches.

[[Human sexual activity|Sexual activity]] has been reported by a proportion of male and female migraine sufferers to relieve migraine pain significantly in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Houle TT, Dhingra LK, Remble TA, Rokicki LA, Penzien DB |title=Not tonight, I have a headache? |journal=Headache |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=983–90 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16732844 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2006.00470.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0017-8748&date=2006&volume=46&issue=6&spage=983}}</ref>

In many cases where a migraine follows a particular cycle, attempting to interrupt the cycle may prolong the symptoms. Letting a headache "run its course" by not using painkillers can sometimes decrease the length of an episode. This is especially true of cases where vomiting is common, as often the headache will subside immediately after vomiting. Curbing the pain may delay vomiting, and prolong the headache.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Gluten-Free Diet==
Some individuals have a condition called [[celiac disease]] (or "[[gluten]] intolerance") that results in the body incorrectly processing gluten. Studies have suggested that 4% <ref>"Erratum in: Am J Gastroenterol. 2003 Jul;98(7):1674"</ref> of migraine sufferers have celiac disease, and for those who do, decreasing gluten intake may significantly reduce migraine frequency.<ref name="Migraine Linked to Celiac Disease">[http://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/news/20030321/migraine-linked-to-celiac-disease Migraine Linked to Celiac Disease]</ref> [[Celiac disease]] and gluten sensitivity may be an underlying cause of migraines in some patients, and a gluten-free diet has been demonstrated to reduce, if not completely eliminate, migraines in these individuals. A study of 10 patients with a long history of chronic headaches that had recently worsened or were resistant to treatment found that all 10 patients were sensitive to gluten. MRI scans determined that each had inflammation in their central nervous systems caused by gluten-sensitivity. Seven out of nine of these patients that went on a gluten-free diet stopped having headaches completely.<ref name="celiac.com">[http://www.celiac.com/articles/121/1/Migraine-Headaches-Gluten-Triggers-Severe-Headaches-in-Sensitive-Individuals/Page1.html Migraine Headaches: Gluten Triggers Severe Headaches in Sensitive Individuals]</ref> Another study showed that migraneurs were 10 times more likely than the general population to have celiac disease, and that for migraneurs with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet improved blood-flow to the brain and either eliminated migraines or reduced migraine frequency, duration, and intensity.<ref name="Migraine Linked to Celiac Disease"/>

;Feverfew
The plant feverfew (''[[Tanacetum parthenium]]'') is a traditional herbal remedy believed to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks.

==Prescription drugs==
A 2006 review article by S. Modi and D. Lowder offers some general guidelines on when a physician should consider prescribing drugs for migraine prevention:

{{quote|Following appropriate management of acute migraine, patients should be evaluated for initiation of preventive therapy. Factors that should prompt consideration of preventive therapy include the occurrence of two or more migraines per month with disability lasting three or more days per month; failure of, contraindication for, or adverse events from acute treatments; use of abortive medication more than twice per week; and uncommon migraine conditions (e.g., hemiplegic migraine, migraine with prolonged aura, migrainous infarction). Patient preference and cost also should be considered.

...Therapy should be initiated with medications that have the highest levels of effectiveness and the lowest potential for adverse reactions; these should be started at low dosages and titrated slowly. A full therapeutic trial may take two to six months. After successful therapy (e.g., reduction of migraine frequency by approximately 50 percent or more) has been maintained for six to 12 months, discontinuation of preventive therapy can be considered.<ref name="AFP0601"/>}}

Preventive medication has to be taken on a daily basis, usually for a few weeks, before the effectiveness can be determined. Supervision by a [[neurologist]] is advisable. A large number of medications with varying modes of action can be used. Selection of a suitable medication for any particular patient is a matter of trial and error, since the effectiveness of individual medications varies widely from one patient to the next. Often preventive medications do not have to be taken indefinitely. Sometimes as little as six months of preventive therapy is enough to "break the headache cycle" and then they can be discontinued.

The most effective prescription medications include several drug classes:
;[[Beta blockers]] such as [[propranolol]] and [[atenolol]]. 
A [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] of nine [[randomized controlled trials]] or [[crossover studies]], which together included 668 patients, found that [[propranolol]] had an "overall [[relative risk]] of response to treatment (here called the 'responder ratio')" was 1.94.<ref name="pmid15106196">{{cite journal | author = Linde K, Rossnagel K | title = Propranolol for migraine prophylaxis | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 2| pages = CD003225 | year = 2004| pmid = 15106196 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003225.pub2 | editor1-last = Linde | editor1-first = Klaus}}</ref>
;[[Anticonvulsants]] 
Anticonvulsants such as [[valproic acid]] and [[topiramate]]. A [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] of ten [[randomized controlled trials]] or [[crossover studies]], which together included 1341 patients, found [[anticonvulsants]] had an "2.4 times more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in frequency with anticonvulsants than with placebo" and a [[number needed to treat]] of 3.8.<ref name="pmid15266476">{{cite journal | author = Chronicle E, Mulleners W | title = Anticonvulsant drugs for migraine prophylaxis | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 3| pages = CD003226 | year = 2004| pmid = 15266476 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003226.pub2 | editor1-last = Mulleners | editor1-first = Wim M}}</ref> However, concerns have been raised about the marketing of [[gabapentin]].<ref name="pmid16908919">{{cite journal | author = Steinman M, Bero L, Chren M, Landefeld C | title = Narrative review: the promotion of gabapentin: an analysis of internal industry documents | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 145 | issue = 4 | pages = 284–93 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16908919}}</ref>

==Surgical treatments==
{{Main|Migraine surgery}}

A major advantage of migraine surgery is that, with the correct diagnostic techniques, a definite diagnosis can be made before the surgery is undertaken. Once a positive diagnosis has been made, the results of surgery are outstanding and provide permanent pain relief,  as well as relief from the associated symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, and sound sensitivity. There are a number of surgical solutions to migraines, some of which are being used on selected patients with great success. Positive reports have appeared in the medical literature with regard to the surgical cauterization of the superficial blood vessels of the scalp (the terminal branches of the external carotid artery), and decompression of certain [[nerves]] around the head and neck.

===Arterial surgery===

Surgical cauterization of the superficial blood vessels of the scalp (the terminal branches of the external carotid artery) is only carried out if it has been established with certainty that these vessels are indeed the source of pain. It is a safe and relatively atraumatic procedure which can be performed in a day facility.<ref name="autogenerated451">{{cite journal |pages=451–6 |doi=10.2217/14750708.4.4.451 |title=Vascular surgery for chronic migraine |year=2007 |last1=Shevel |first1=Elliot |journal=Therapy |volume=4 |issue=4}}</ref>

===Nerve decompression===

[[Migraine surgery]] which involves decompression of certain [[nerves]] around the head and neck may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications.<ref name=Surgery2011>{{cite journal|last=Kung|first=TA|coauthors=Guyuron, B, Cederna, PS|title=Migraine surgery: a plastic surgery solution for refractory migraine headache|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=2011 Jan|volume=127|issue=1|pages=181–9|pmid=20871488|doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181f95a01}}</ref> It is only effective in those who respond well to [[Botox]] injections in specific areas.<ref name="Guyuron 2005">{{cite journal |pmid=15622223 |year=2005 |last1=Guyuron |first1=B |last2=Kriegler |first2=JS |last3=Davis |first3=J |last4=Amini |first4=SB |title=Comprehensive surgical treatment of migraine headaches |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery}}</ref><ref name="Poggi 2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e31817742da |title=Confirmation of Surgical Decompression to Relieve Migraine Headaches |year=2008 |last1=Poggi |first1=Joseph T. |last2=Grizzell |first2=Brett E. |last3=Helmer |first3=Stephen D. |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=122 |pages=115–22; discussion 123–4 |pmid=18594393 |issue=1}}</ref>

===Botulinum toxin injection===

[[Botulinum neurotoxin]] (Botox) injections have been approved in the US and UK for prevention of chronic migraines,<ref name="allergan.com">[http://agn.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=486424 BOTOX(R) Receives First Authorisation in UK as Preventative Treatment in Chronic Migraine]</ref> but do not appear to work for episodic migraines.<ref name="Naumann 2008">{{cite pmid|18458231}}</ref> Several [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] surgical procedures are currently under investigation.

===Closure of patent foramen ovale===

There also appears to be a [[causal]] link between the presence of a [[patent foramen ovale]] and migraines.<ref name="Post 2007">{{cite pmid|17143907}}</ref><ref name="Diener 2007">{{cite pmid|17504652}}</ref> There is evidence that the correction of the [[congenital heart defect]], patent foramen ovale (PFO), reduces migraine frequency and severity.<ref name="Reisman">{{cite journal |jstor=4016110 |pages=119–120 |last1=Harder |first1=B. |title=Against the Migraine |volume=167 |issue=8 |journal=Science News |year=2005 |doi=10.2307/4016110}}</ref> Recent studies have advised caution, though, in relation to [[PFO]] closure for migraines, as insufficient evidence exists to justify this dangerous procedure.<ref name="Schürks 2009">{{cite journal |pmid=19048002 |year=2009 |last1=Schürks |first1=M |last2=Diener |first2=HC |title=Closure of patent foramen ovale in the prevention of migraine: Not enough evidence in favor |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=22–3 |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0971 |journal=Nature clinical practice.

==Trigger avoidance==
General dietary restriction has not been demonstrated to be an effective approach to treating migraine.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Holzhammer J, Wöber C|title=Alimentary trigger factors that provoke migraine and tension-type headache|journal=Schmerz|year=2006|volume=20|language=German|pmid=15806385|issue=2|pages=151–9|doi=10.1007/s00482-005-0390-2}}</ref>
