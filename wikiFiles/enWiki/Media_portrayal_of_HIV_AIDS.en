'''The portrayal of HIV and AIDS in the media''' refers to events and trends in the discussion of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in [[mass media]].

The condition which was later to be called AIDS was first noticed as something strange and different in June 1981 when the [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported that five gay men in Los Angeles all died from a similar rare set of disease symptoms.  Within two months 100 more gay men had died, and there was public awareness from medical publication that some new disease existed. Most media outlets have shown the tendency to universalize by emphasizing the risk to an entire age group, sex or sexual orientation as opposed to the behaviors and characteristics of individuals which pose the greater risk.<ref>Schwartz Joel;Murray David. "Aids and the Media". Public Interest 125, 1996 ,p.57.</ref>  How and when various media outlets throughout the world published this information varies, as has subsequent and contemporary reporting and depiction of HIV and AIDS in the media.

==Media figures known for presenting HIV/AIDS issues==
===People===
{{main|List of HIV-positive people}}
Worldwide and historically, public figures have often led trends in reporting HIV/AIDS issues.

===Campaigns===
Various [[health campaigns]] have had increased media discussion of HIV/AIDS as a goal.

==Themes in media depictions==
Some identified themes which repeatedly appear in media depicting HIV are the concept of "[[other]]",{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=15-32}} [[victim blaming]],{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=33-39}} [[heterosexism]],{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=45-58}} and comparisons of the lifestyles of people in [[urban areas]] versus [[rural areas]].{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=67-76}}

;Other
In media with a theme of the "[[other]]" there is some depiction of a [[dichotomy]]. The divide in stories depicting AIDS is often [[HIV-positive people]] versus people without HIV, persons at high risk for contracting HIV versus people with low risk, innocent victims of HIV versus people shown to have guilt, and the general concept of contamination in blood versus pure blood.<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2000|p=15}}, citing {{cite journal|last=Gamson|first=Josh|title=Silence, Death, and the Invisible Enemy: AIDS Activism and Social Movement "Newness"|journal=Social Problems|date=1 October 1989|volume=36|issue=4|pages=351–367|doi=10.2307/800820}}</ref> In all of these cases, the movie frequently portrays one side of the dichotomy as good and the other was evil.{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=15}}

;Victim blaming
Movies with a theme of "victim blaming" portray people living with AIDS as being [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]] or [[culpability|culpable]] for contracting HIV. In such themes, persons with HIV threaten the health of innocent people.{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=35}}

;Heterosexism
The United States news media associated AIDS with gay men beginning in 1982 despite the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] at that time having regularly revealed that other populations also were contracting the infection causing AIDS.<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2000|p=45}}, citing {{cite book|title=AIDS : the making of a chronic disease|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520077782|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft9b69p35n&chunk.id=d0e2327&toc.id=&brand=ucpress|author1=Timothy E.

Lesbian women and gay men on television.}}</ref> Movies which feature HIV as a theme frequently depict a gay male as the central character with AIDS.{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=47}} Media depiction of AIDS as a gay male disease is problematic because it fails to promote public understanding of the impact of AIDS on the diverse populations which AIDS affects.<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2000|p=65}}, citing {{cite book|author1=Sobnosky, Matthew J |author2=Eric Hauser|title=Power in the blood : a handbook on AIDS, politics, and communication|year=1999|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, N.J.|isbn=978-0805829068|pages=25–38|editor=William N. Elwood|chapter=Initiating or Avoiding Activism: Red Ribbons, Pink Triangles, and Public Argument About AIDS}}</ref>

;Urban versus rural
Representations of AIDS in media may make a comparison between urban and rural areas. In such portrayals, the city may be portrayed as a place for gay community and the spread of AIDS while the rural areas represent morality, conservationism, and freedom from harmful deviancy.{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=67,76}}

==Notable depiction==
*''[[Buddies (1985 film)|Buddies]]'' (1985) - first independent film to depict the AIDS epidemic
*''[[An Early Frost]]'' (1985) - first network film to depict the AIDS epidemic

In 1994 the [[Philippines]] government began its first major program to combat the spread of HIV.

====In government====
In 1983 the [[United States Public Health Service]] defined AIDS as its "number one priority"<ref>{{cite news|last=Pear|first=Robert|title=Health Chief Calls AIDS Battle 'No. 1 Priority'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/25/us/health-chief-calls-aids-battle-no-1-priority.html|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 May 1983}}</ref>  and [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|US secretary of Health]] [[Margaret Heckler]] said that it was her "top priority".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Heckler asks more AIDS funds|url=http://www.aegis.com/news/nyt/1983/NYT830811.html|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=18 August 1983}}</ref>  In contrast, US President [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected to office in 1980 and held it until 1989, and in that time, he only gave a single speech mentioning the word "AIDS" and this was in 1987.

In 1993 he testified to the United States Congress on his experience, and stated that "If you want to reach me as a young gay man — especially a young gay man of color — then you need to give me information in a language and vocabulary I can understand and relate to."  He is credited as being a particularly effective spokesperson for raising awareness about HIV in the Latino community.
