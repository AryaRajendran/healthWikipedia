'''Sheehan syndrome''', also known as '''Simmonds' syndrome''', or '''postpartum hypopituitarism''' or '''postpartum pituitary necrosis''', is [[hypopituitarism]] (decreased functioning of the [[pituitary gland]]), caused by ischemic [[necrosis]] due to [[hemorrhage|blood loss]] and [[hypovolemic shock]] during and after [[childbirth]]. Pituitary damage unrelated to pregnancy is called Simmonds' disease.<ref>First Aid for the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship, p. 226, PITUITARY (HYPOESTROGENIC AMENORRHEA)</ref>

==Incidence==
In a study of 1034 symptomatic adults, Sheehan’s syndrome was found to be the sixth most frequent etiology of growth hormone deficiency, being responsible for 3.1% of cases (versus 53.9% due to a pituitary tumor).<ref>Abs R, Bengtsson B-Å, Hernberg-Stahl E, Monson JP, Tauber JP, Wilton P & Wuster C. GH replacement in 1034 growth hormone deficient hypopituitary adults: demographic and clinical characteristics, dosing and safety. Clinical Endocrinology 1999 50 703–713.</ref>

==Causes==
It is a rare complication of [[pregnancy]], usually occurring after excessive blood loss. The presence of [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (i.e., in [[amniotic fluid embolism]] or [[HELLP syndrome]]) also appears to be a factor in its development.

==Symptoms==
Most common initial symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome are [[agalactorrhea]] (absence of lactation) and/or difficulties with lactation.<ref name=schrager/> Many women also report [[amenorrhea]] or [[oligomenorrhea]] after delivery.<ref name=schrager/> In some cases, a woman with Sheehan syndrome might be relatively asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is not made until years later, with features of [[hypopituitarism]].<ref name=schrager/> Such features include secondary [[hypothyroidism]] with tiredness, [[Cold sensitivity|intolerance to cold]], [[constipation]], [[weight gain]], [[alopecia|hair loss]] and slowed thinking, as well as [[bradycardia|a slowed heart rate]] and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]. Another such feature is secondary [[adrenal insufficiency]], which, in the rather chronic case is similar to [[Addison's disease]] with symptoms including [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[weight loss#Unintentional weight loss|weight loss]], [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar levels), [[anemia]] and [[hyponatremia]] (low sodium levels). Such a woman may, however, become acutely exacerbated when her body is stressed by, for example, a severe infection or surgery years after her delivery, a condition equivalent with an [[Addisonian crisis]].<ref name=schrager/> [[Gonadotropin]] deficiency will often cause [[amenorrhea]], [[oligomenorrhea]], [[hot flushes]], or [[decreased libido]].<ref name=schrager/> Growth hormone deficiency causes many vague symptoms including fatigue and decreased muscle mass.<ref name=schrager>{{cite journal |author=Schrager S, Sabo L |title=Sheehan syndrome: a rare complication of postpartum hemorrhage |journal=J Am Board Fam Pract |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=389–91 |year=2001 |pmid=11572546 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Uncommonly, Sheehan syndrome may also appear acutely after delivery, mainly by [[hyponatremia]].<ref name=schrager/> There are several possible mechanisms by which hypopituitarism can result in hyponatremia, including decreased free-water clearance by hypothyroidism, direct [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion|syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) hypersecretion]], decreased free-water clearance by glucocorticoid deficiency (independent of ADH).<ref name=schrager/> The potassium level in these situations is normal, because adrenal production of aldosterone is not dependent on the pituitary.<ref name=schrager/> There have also been cases with acute hypoglycemia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bunch TJ, Dunn WF, Basu A, Gosman RI |title=Hyponatremia and hypoglycemia in acute Sheehan's syndrome |journal=Gynecol. Endocrinol. |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=419–23 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12587538 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The order of frequency of hormone loss has generally been found to be growth hormone, gonadotropins (FSH, LH), adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and thyrotrophin (TRH).<ref>Rabkin MT & Frantz AG. Hypopituitarism: a study of growth hormone and other endocrine functions. Annals of Internal Medicine 1966 64 1197–1207.</ref><ref>Kelestimur F, Jonsson P, Molvalilar S, Gomez JM, Auernhammer CJ, Colak R, Koltowska-Häggström M, Goth MI. Sheehan's syndrome: baseline characteristics and effect of 2 years of growth hormone replacement therapy in 91 patients in KIMS - Pfizer International Metabolic Database. Eur J Endocrinol. 2005 Apr;152(4):581-7.</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of [[lactotrophs]] during pregnancy results in the enlargement of the [[anterior pituitary]], without a corresponding increase in blood supply. 

Secondly, the anterior pituitary is supplied by a low pressure [[portal venous system]].<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=endocrin&part=A1257 under heading ''Sheehan's syndrome''</ref>

These vulnerabilities, when affected by major [[hemorrhage]] or hypotension during the peripartum period, can result in [[ischaemia]] of the affected pituitary regions leading to [[necrosis]]. 

The [[posterior pituitary]] is usually not affected due to its direct arterial supply.

A 1995 study found that 56.2% of patients with Sheehan’s syndrome experienced a loss of all pituitary hormones (with the remaining 43.8% having selective pituitary insufficiency). However, likely because the growth hormone-secreting cells are located at the periphery of the pituitary (and are therefore most likely to be affected by ischemia), all the patients had growth hormone deficiency.<ref>Keleştimur F. GH deficiency and the degree of hypopituitarism. Clinical Endocrinology 1995 42 443–444.</ref>

==History==

The specific association with postpartum shock or haemorrhage was described in 1937 by the British pathologist Harold Leeming Sheehan (1900–1988),<ref>H. L. Sheehan. Post-partum necrosis of anterior pituitary. The Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology, Chichester, 1937, 45: 189-214.</ref> whereas [[Simmond's disease]] occurs in either sex due to causes unrelated to pregnancy.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2009|Sheehan's syndrome}}</ref>
