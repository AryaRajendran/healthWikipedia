'''Erythema infectiosum''' or '''fifth disease''' is one of several possible manifestations of infection by [[erythrovirus]], previously called [[parvovirus B19]].<ref name="pmid15767606">{{cite journal |author=Weir E |title=Parvovirus B19 infection: fifth disease and more |journal=CMAJ |volume=172 |issue=6 |pages=743 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15767606 |pmc=552884 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.045293 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15767606}}</ref> The disease is also referred to as '''slapped cheek syndrome''', '''slapcheek''', '''slap face''' or '''slapped face'''.<ref name=Sabella1999/><ref name=Servey2007/>  In [[Japan]] the disease is called "[[apple]] sickness" or ''ringo-byou'' (りんご病）in reference to the symptom of facial redness. In Hungary it is called "butterfly pox" as the red cheeks look like the wings of a [[butterfly]].

==Symptoms==
The Fifth Disease starts with a low-grade fever, headache, and cold like symptoms, such as a runny or stuffy nose.  These symptoms pass, then a few days later the rash appears.  The bright red rash most commonly appears in the face. [[Cheek]]s are a defining symptom of the infection in children (hence the name "slapped cheek disease"). Occasionally the [[rash]] will extend over the bridge of the nose or around the mouth.  In addition to red cheeks, children often develop a red, lacy rash on the rest of the body, with the upper arms, torso, and legs being the most common locations. The rash typically lasts a couple of days and may itch; some cases have been known to last for several weeks. Patients are usually no longer infectious once the rash has appeared.<ref name=Sabella1999>

Teenagers and adults may present with a self-limited [[arthritis]]. It manifests in painful [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the [[joint]]s that feels similar to arthritis. Older children and adults with fifth disease may have difficulty in walking and in bending joints such as wrists, knees, ankles, fingers, and shoulders.<ref name=Sabella1999/><ref name=Servey2007/>

The [[disease]] is usually mild,<ref name="pmid10099795">{{cite journal |author=Mankuta D, Bar-Oz B, Koren G |title=Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) and pregnancy |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=45 |issue= |pages=603–5 |year=1999 |month=March |pmid=10099795 |pmc=2328398 |doi= |url=}}</ref> but in certain risk groups it can have serious consequences:
* In pregnant women,  infection in the [[Pregnancy#First trimester|first trimester]] has been linked to [[hydrops fetalis]], causing spontaneous [[miscarriage]].
* In people with [[sickle-cell disease]] or other forms of chronic [[hemolytic anemia]] such as [[hereditary spherocytosis]], infection can precipitate an [[Reticulocytopenia|aplastic crisis]].<ref name=Sabella1999/><ref name=Servey2007/>
* It should also be noted that those who are immuno-compromised ([[HIV/AIDS]], [[Chemotherapy]]) may be at risk for complications if exposed.<ref>Yoto, Y., et. al, (2003). "Retrospective study on the influence of human parvovirus B19 infection among children with malignant diseases". Acta Haematol pg.8-12, PMID 8237278</ref>

== Transmission ==
Fifth disease is transmitted primarily by respiratory secretions ([[saliva]], [[mucus]], etc.) but can also be spread by contact with infected [[blood]]. The incubation period (the time between the initial infection and the onset of symptoms) is usually between 4 and 21 days. Individuals with fifth disease are most infectious before the onset of symptoms. Typically, school children, day-care workers, teachers and mothers are most likely to be exposed to the virus. When symptoms are evident, there is little risk of transmission; therefore, symptomatic individuals need not be isolated.<ref name=Sabella1999/><ref name=Servey2007/>

== Epidemiology ==
Any age may be affected although it is most common in children aged five to fifteen years.<ref name="urleMedicine - Pediatrics, Fifth Disease or Erythema Infectiosum : Article by Kenneth T Kwon">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic378.htm |title=Pediatrics, Fifth Disease or Erythema Infectiosum | last=Kwon | first=Kenneth T |work= eMedicine | date=March 19, 2009 | accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>  By the time adulthood is reached about half the population will have become [[immune]] following infection at some time in their past.<ref name=Sabella1999/><ref name=Servey2007/> Outbreaks can arise especially in nursery schools, preschools, and elementary schools.

== History ==
The name "fifth disease" is not typically capitalized, since the name derives from its historical classification as the fifth of the classical childhood skin rashes or [[exanthem]]s. Their classification is as follows: 
#[[Measles]]
#[[Scarlet fever]]
#[[Rubella]]
#[[Dukes' disease]]
#Fifth disease (erythema infectiosum)
#[[Roseola]]

It was first described by [[Robert Willan]] in 1799 as "Rubeola, sine catarrho". It was better defined by Anton Tschamer in 1889 as a [[rubella]] variant ("Ortliche Rotheln"), identified as a distinct condition in 1896 by T. Escherich, and given the name "erythema infectiosum" in 1899.<ref name="urlTHE DOCTORS WORLD - New York Times">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/30/science/the-doctor-s-world.html?pagewanted=all |title=THE DOCTOR'S WORLD | last=Altman | first=Lawrence K | newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 30, 1982 | accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Treatment is supportive as the infection is frequently self-limiting. Anti-pyretics are commonly used. The rash is painless and non-pruritic requiring no specific therapy.
