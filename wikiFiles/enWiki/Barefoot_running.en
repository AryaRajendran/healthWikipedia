[[File:Beat The Bridge Barefoot Runner.JPG|thumb|A barefoot runner on [[asphalt]]]]
'''Barefoot running''', also called "natural running", is the act of running without [[footwear]]. Throughout human history, running [[barefoot]] was the natural way to run, and cultures such as the [[Tarahumara]] people in [[Mexico]] still practice it today.  Barefoot running became popular in the latter half of the 20th century, as notable Olympic runners such as [[Abebe Bikila]], [[Bruce Tulloh]], and [[Zola Budd]] participated barefoot.
Scientific research into the practice of running barefoot has not reached a clear consensus regarding its risks or its benefits. While shoes provide necessary foot protection from cuts, bruises, and the weather, proponents of barefoot running argue that it offers benefits and is healthier for the feet by reducing the risk of chronic injuries (notably [[repetitive stress injuries]]) due to the impact of [[heel strike (gait)|heel striking]] in padded running shoes.

To provide the benefits of both running barefoot and shod, different varieties of barefoot-inspired footwear are available, including thin-soled and flexible shoes such as traditional [[moccasin]]s and [[huarache (running shoe)|huarache]]s, and modern footwear like [[Vibram FiveFingers]] and [[Vivobarefoot]]. Running almost barefoot in thin-soled shoes may be termed '''minimalist running'''.

== History ==
Throughout most of human history, running was performed while barefoot or in thin-soled shoes such as [[moccasin]]s.  This practice continues today in [[Kenya]] and among the [[Tarahumara]] people of northern Mexico.<ref name="McDougall_Boston_Globe">{{cite news|last=McDougall|first=Christopher|title=What Ruins Running|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2009/04/19/what_ruins_running/|accessdate=14 November 2010|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=April 19, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101014045313/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2009/04/19/what_ruins_running/| archivedate= 14 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Historians believe that the runners of [[Ancient Greece]] ran barefoot.

Modern barefoot running first rose to prominence in 1960, when [[Abebe Bikila]] of [[Ethiopia]] won the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|Olympic marathon]] in Rome barefoot after discovering that [[Adidas]], the Olympic shoe supplier, had run out of shoes in his size.

== Health and medical implications ==

Since the latter half of the 20th century, there has been much scientific and medical interest in the benefits and harm involved in barefoot running.

[[File:barefootfoot rick.jpg|thumb|left|Bare feet on asphalt]]
The structure of the human foot and lower leg is very efficient at absorbing the shock of landing and turning the energy of the fall into forward motion, through the springing action of the foot's natural arch. Scientists studying runners' foot motions have observed striking differences between habitually shod runners and barefoot runners. The foot of habitually shod runners typically lands with an initial heel strike, while the foot of a barefoot runner lands with a more springy step on the middle, or on the ball of the foot.<ref name="Reuters_0127">{{cite news|title=The best running shoe may be nature's own: study|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/27/us-running-idUSTRE60Q6FA20100127|accessdate=July 17, 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> In addition, the strike is shorter in duration and the step rate is higher. When looking at the muscle activity (electromyography), studies have shown a higher pre-activation of the plantar flexor muscles when running barefoot.{{cn|date=January 2013}} Indeed, since muscles' role is to prepare the locomotor system for the contact with the ground, muscle activity before the strike depends on the expected impact. Forefoot strike, shorter step duration, higher rate and higher muscle pre-activation are techniques to reduce stress of repetitive high chocks.<ref name="Divert">Divert C., Mornieux G., Freychat P., Baur H., Mayer F., Belli A., "Mechanical comparison of Barefoot and Shod Running." International Journal of Sports Medicine 26.7. 2005; 593–598</ref> This avoids a very painful and heavy impact, equivalent to two to three times the body weight.<ref name="LiebermanDE"/> "People who don't wear shoes when they run have an astonishingly different strike", said Daniel E. Lieberman, professor of human evolutionary biology at [[Harvard University]] and co-author of a paper appearing in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. "By landing on the middle or front of the foot, barefoot runners have almost no impact collision, much less than most shod runners generate when they heel-strike."<ref name="Hersher_Rebecca">{{cite news|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|title=Study finds barefoot runners have less foot stress than shod ones (w/ Video)|url=http://phys.org/news183817654.html|accessdate=July 17, 2012|newspaper=[[PhysOrg]]|date=January 27, 2010}}</ref>

However, when comparing different populations of habitually barefoot runners, not all of them favor the forefoot strike. A 2012 study by Hatala et al. focusing on 38 runners of the [[Daasanach people|Daasanach]] tribe in [[Kenya]] found that a majority of runners favored a heel strike instead of a forefoot strike.<ref name="Hatala_KG">{{cite journal|last=Hatala, K.G.; Dingwall, H.L.; Wunderlich, R.E.; Richmond, B.G.|title=Variation in Foot Strike Patterns during Running among Habitually Barefoot Populations.|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=January 9, 2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052548|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0052548|accessdate=January 28, 2013}}</ref> Presently, Hatala and Lieberman are comparing their data, but Lieberman did note that his study, which focused on the [[Kalenjin people]], also found some barefoot runners favoring a heel strike as well. He also said that the Daasanach people were primarily, "tall, lanky goat-herders who don't run nearly as much as the Kalenjin, who own many of the world's distance running records."<ref name="Bernstein_Lenny">{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Lenny|title=‘Minimalist’ running style may be undermined by new findings from Kenya.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/minimalist-running-style-may-be-undermined-by-new-findings-from-kenya/2013/01/18/e1f4100c-60d2-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_story.html|accessdate=January 28, 2013|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=January 21, 2013}}</ref>

The longitudinal (medial) arch of the foot also may undergo physiological changes upon habitually training barefoot. The longitudinal arch has been observed to decrease in length by an average of 4.7&nbsp;mm, suggesting activation of foot musculature when barefoot that is usually inactive when shod. These muscles allow the foot to dampen impact and may remove stress from the [[plantar fascia]].<ref name="Robbins_Hanna">{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=S|coauthors=Hanna A|title=Running-related injury prevention through barefoot adaptations|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|year=1987|volume=19|issue=2|pages=148–156|pmid=2883551}}</ref> In addition to muscle changes, barefoot running also reduces energy use &ndash; [[oxygen]] consumption was found to be approximately 4% higher in shod versus barefoot runners. Better running economy observed when running barefoot compared to running with shoes can be explained by a better use of the muscle elasticity. In fact, reduction of contact time and higher pre-stretch level can enhance the stretch shortening cycle behavior of the plantar flexor muscles and thus possibly allow a better storage and restitution of elastic energy compared to shod running.<ref name="Divert" />

Running in shoes also appears to increase the risk of [[ankle]] sprains, [[plantar fasciitis]], as well as other chronic injuries of the lower limb. However, running shoes also provide several advantages, including protection of the runner from puncture wounds, bruising, thermal injuries from extreme weather conditions, and overuse injuries.<ref name="Warburton_Michael">{{cite journal |url=http://sportsci.org/jour/0103/mw.htm |title=Barefoot Running |last=Michael |first=Warburton |month=December |year=2001 |journal=Sportscience |volume=5 |issue=3 |ref=harv}}</ref> Transitioning to a barefoot running style also takes time to develop, due to the use of different muscles involved. Doctors in the United States have reported an increase in such injuries as pulled calf muscles, [[Achilles tendinitis]], and metatarsal [[stress fracture]]s, which they attribute to barefoot runners attempting to transition too fast.<ref name="Chang_Alicia">{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Alicia|title=Barefoot Running Injuries: Doctors See Health Problems Ranging From Stress Fractures To Pulled Calf Muscles|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/barefoot-running-injuries_n_1536017.html|accessdate=July 18, 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

The [[athletic shoe|running shoe]] itself has also been examined as a possible cause of many injuries associated with shod running. One 1991 study found that wearers of expensive running shoes that are promoted as having special features, such as added cushioning or ''pronation correction'', were injured significantly more frequently than runners wearing inexpensive shoes.<ref name="McDougall_Christopher"/> It has also been found that running in conventional running shoes increases stress on the knee joints up to 38%, although it is still unclear if this leads to a higher rate of heel injuries or not.<ref name="Kerrigan_Casey">{{cite journal |last1=Kerrigan |first1=D.

Before the modern running shoe was invented, [[plimsolls]], or thin-soled canvas shoes, were worn by children in the [[United Kingdom]] for physical education classes as well as soldiers for PT training. Inexpensive "dime store" plimsolls have very thin footbeds (3mm elastomer/rubber outsole, 1mm card, 2mm eva foam) and no heel lift or stiffening.

Some modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear to mimic the barefoot running experience, maintaining optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree of protection.
