'''BlackBerry thumb''' is a [[neologism]] that refers to a form of [[repetitive strain injury]] caused by the frequent use of the thumbs to press buttons on [[personal data assistant|PDAs]], [[smartphone]]s, or other [[mobile device]]s. The name of the condition comes from the [[BlackBerry]], a brand of smartphones that debuted in 1999,<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_65822.html ]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> although there are numerous other similar [[eponymous]] conditions that exist (e.g. "wiiitis",<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nett MP, Collins MS, Sperling JW |title=Magnetic resonance imaging of acute "wiiitis" of the upper extremity,can cuse the loss of the tumb cusing problems for takin the bus |journal=Skeletal Radiology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=481–83 |year=2008 |pmid=18259743 |doi=10.1007/s00256-008-0456-1}}</ref> "nintendinitis",<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koh TH |title=Ulcerative "nintendinitis": a new kind of repetitive strain injury |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=173 |issue=11-12 |pages=671 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11379534}}</ref> "playstation thumb", and "cellphone thumb"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karim SA |title=From 'playstation thumb' to 'cellphone thumb': the new epidemic in teenagers |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=161–2 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19563092}}</ref>).
Part of the rationale is that the thumb does not have the [[dexterity]] that the other four fingers have, and that it is especially common in those who use these devices for such activities at high speeds comparable to that of [[touch typing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arthritis.webmd.com/news/20050126/BlackBerry-thumb-real-illness-just-dumb |title=BlackBerry Thumb: Real Illness or Just Dumb? |publisher=Arthritis.webmd.com |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

Symptoms of BlackBerry thumb include aching and throbbing pain in the thumb or sometimes other fingers and in the wrist.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/22/AR2005042201739.html | work=The Washington Post | title=For Some, Thumb Pain Is BlackBerry's Stain | first=Amy | last=Joyce | date=2005-04-23 | accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> Part of the syndrome of BlackBerry thumb is disability of the hands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2005/10/69294 |title=The Agony of 'BlackBerry Thumb' |publisher=Wired.com |date=2005-10-21 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Given the way mobile devices are constructed, particularly their small size, most users find it easiest and most tempting to use their thumbs to press the keys.

Experts recommend that BlackBerry thumb can be prevented by use of other fingers to press buttons on handheld devices, and to vary which fingers are being used. They also encourage owners of these devices not to use them for lengthy typing tasks, such as "writing books."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/15/AR2008061500481.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Beware the 'BlackBerry Thumb' | first=Serena | last=Gordon | date=2008-06-15 | accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>

In the absence of better evidence, such speculative preventative measures risk stigmatizing hand use,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anthony S, Lozano-Calderon S, Ring D |title=Stigmatization of repetitive hand use in newspaper reports of hand illness |journal=Hand |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=30–3 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18780117 |pmc=2528973 |doi=10.1007/s11552-007-9052-4}}</ref> which can increase illness behavior as seen in the Australian epidemic of repetitive strain injury.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ireland DC |title=Australian repetition strain injury phenomenon |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research |volume= |issue=351 |pages=63–73 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9646748}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Original research|date=October 2010}}
The recovery process from BlackBerry thumb can be lengthy, and may involve curtailing or altogether eliminating such use of a mobile device. In some extreme cases, [[surgery]] may be necessary.  Current surgical alternatives include a tendon transfer whereby one of the bones at the base of the thumb is removed and a coiled tendon is put in its place as a cushion.  For more advanced cases of arthritis, the basal thumb joint can be replaced.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Badia A, Sambandam SN |title=Total joint arthroplasty in the treatment of advanced stages of thumb carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis |journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1605–14 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17145380 |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.08.008}}</ref> However, recovery can be lengthy and outcomes optimal only in patients who have low activity demands on the thumb joint.

One alternative medicine treatment is [[prolotherapy]].  Reeves has published a small [[randomized clinical trial]] showing some efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reeves KD, Hassanein K |title=Randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled double-blind study of dextrose prolotherapy for osteoarthritic thumb and finger (DIP, PIP, and trapeziometacarpal) joints: evidence of clinical efficacy |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=311–20 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10976977 |doi=10.1089/10755530050120673}}</ref> Since surgery on small hand joints with severe arthritis can be traumatic with protracted recovery, newer treatments are being developed.

==Alternative view==
The primary issue seems to be a misinterpretation or an overinterpretation of the nociception (pain-related nerve signal) that can accompany arm use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ring D, Kadzielski J, Malhotra L, Lee SG, Jupiter JB |title=Psychological factors associated with idiopathic arm pain |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=374–80 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15687162 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.D.01907}}</ref> Nociception can stimulate our built-in "pain alarm," alerting us to real or potential tissue damage; however, we learn to interpret and reassign these signals because most pains are false alarms. For instance, in many contexts, activity-related pain is seen as healthy: think yoga or other athletic/exercise endeavors.   

Common features of activity-related pains that have not received the attention they deserve include stress, job burnout or dissatisfaction, and secondary gain (where a person benefits either directly or indirectly from being ill).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karels CH, Bierma-Zeinstra SM, Burdorf A, Verhagen AP, Nauta AP, Koes BW |title=Social and psychological factors influenced the course of arm, neck and shoulder complaints |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=839–48 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17606181 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2006.11.012}}</ref>
