The '''health effects of tea''' have been examined ever since the first infusions of ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' about 4700 years ago in China. The legendary emperor [[Shennong]] claimed in ''The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic'' that ''Camellia sinensis'' infusions were useful for treating conditions including [[tumor]]s, [[abscess]]es, [[urinary bladder|bladder]] ailments, and [[lethargy]].<ref>N.

== Content ==
Tea contains [[Flavan-3-ol|catechins]], a type of [[antioxidant]]. In a freshly picked tea leaf, catechins can compose up to 30% of the dry weight. Catechins are highest in concentration in [[white tea]] and [[green tea]], while [[black tea]] has substantially fewer due to its oxidative preparation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hamza Nassrallah |url=http://www.wondersoftea.com/2009/01/which-tea-is-healthiest.html |title=Which Tea is Healthiest? |publisher=Wonders of Tea |date=2009-01-02 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/132/4/785 |title=Journal of Nutrition - Antioxidant Activity of Black Tea vs. Green Tea |publisher=Jn.nutrition.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> Research by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] has suggested that levels of antioxidants in green and black tea do not differ greatly, with green tea having an [[oxygen radical absorbance capacity]] (ORAC) of 1253 and black tea an ORAC of 1128 (measured in μmolTE/100g).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/ORAC/ORAC07.pdf  |title=Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Foods – 2007 |publisher=Webcitation.org |date=2009-05-23 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ars.usda.gov%2FSP2UserFiles%2FPlace%2F12354500%2FData%2FORAC%2FORAC07.pdf&date=2009-05-23 |archivedate = 2009-05-23}}</ref> The amounts of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[Vegetable fats and oils|fat]], and [[protein]] found in tea are negligible.

=== Theanine and caffeine ===
Tea also contains [[theanine]] and the stimulant [[caffeine]] at about 3% of its dry weight, translating to between 30&nbsp;mg and 90&nbsp;mg per 8 oz (250 ml) cup depending on type, brand<ref>{{cite book |author=Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K.

N.; Green tea composition, consumption, and polyphenol chemistry; ''Preventive Medicine'' '''21'''(3):334-50 (1992)</ref> Due in part to modern day environmental pollution [[fluoride]] and [[aluminium]] have also been found to occur in tea, with certain types of [[Tea brick|brick tea]] made from old leaves and stems having the highest levels. This occurs due to the tea plant's high sensitivity to and absorption of environmental pollutants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Fluoride_in_Tea.php |title=Fluoride in Tea |publisher=I-sis.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VB5-3VKBHN2-4&_user=10&_coverDate=02%2F01%2F1999&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=1f324bfe9e23615d33dc9ced40eeff29&searchtype=a|title=Environmental Pollution: Fluoride contents in tea and soil from tea plantations and the release of fluoride into tea liquor during infusion |publisher=ScienceDirect |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref>  Dry tea has more caffeine by weight than coffee; nevertheless, more dried coffee is used than dry tea in preparing the beverage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stashtea.com/caffeine+and+tea+information.aspx |title=Caffeine and Tea Information |publisher=Stash Tea |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> which means that a cup of brewed tea contains significantly less caffeine than a cup of [[health effects of coffee|coffee]] of the same size.

== Potential benefits ==
[[Green tea]] may lower blood [[low-density lipoprotein]] and total [[cholesterol]] levels, though the studies were of short duration and it is not known if these effects result in fewer deaths; moreover, the evidence does not indicate that green tea reduces the risk of [[coronary artery disease]]. Several randomized controlled trials suggest green tea can reduce [[body fat]] by a small amount for a short time, though it is not certain if the reduction would be meaningful for most people.<ref>Johnson, R.; Bryant, S.; Huntley, A. L. (2012). "Green tea and green tea catechin extracts: An overview of the clinical evidence". Maturitas 73 (4): 280. doi:10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.08.008. PMID 22986087</ref>

=== Anti-cancer properties ===
The FDA in 2005 reports that green tea consumption has no known beneficial effect on breast or prostate cancer.  "Two studies do not show that drinking green tea reduces the risk of breast cancer in women, but one weaker, more limited study suggests that drinking green tea may reduce this risk. Based on these studies, FDA concludes that it is highly unlikely that green tea reduces the risk of breast cancer." 

The FDA also finds that existing evidence does not support qualified health claims for green tea consumption and a reduced risk of any other type of cancer.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web | title = FDA announcement | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2005/ucm108452.htm | author = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate = 20 March 2012 | date = 30 June 2005 }}</ref>

The US [[National Cancer Institute]] reports that in [[Epidemiology#Types of studies|epidemiological studies]] and the few [[clinical trial]]s of tea for the prevention of cancer, the results have been inconclusive.  The institute "does not recommend for or against the use of tea to reduce the risk of any type of cancer." ... "Inconsistencies in study findings regarding tea and cancer risk may be due to variability in tea preparation, tea consumption, the bioavailability of tea compounds (the amounts that can be absorbed by the body), lifestyle differences, and individual genetic differences."<ref name = NCI>{{cite web | title = Tea and Cancer Prevention: Strengths and Limits of the Evidence | author = National Cancer Institute | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/tea | accessdate = 20 March 2012 | date = Reviewed 17 November 2010 }}</ref>

== Potential drawbacks ==

=== Fluoride ===
{{See also|Fluoride#Toxicology}}
{{Expand section|the effects of the fluoride|date=September 2009}}
All tea leaves contain [[fluoride]]; however, mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant.<ref>{{cite journal

It is speculated that hand-picked tea would contain less fluoride than machine-harvested tea, because there is a much lower chance of harvesting older leaves during the harvest process. There is some evidence that over-intake of teas produced using mature leaves (e.g. brick tea) or a combination of mature and young (e.g. through inefficient mechanical harvesting) has been found to cause fluorosis in humans.<ref>Fung KF and MH Wong (2004) Application of different forms of calcium to tea soil to prevent aluminium and fluorine accumulation. J Sci Food Agric 84:1469–1477</ref>

The fluoride content of made tea depends on the picking method and fluoride content of the soil in which it is grown; tea plants absorbs this element at a greater rate than other plants. Care in the choice of the location where the plant is grown may reduce the risk.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Aluminium ===
As with fluoride, the tea plant is a natural bioaccumulator of aluminium, particularly in older leaves, with aluminium concentrations of up to 30,000 ppm aluminium by dry weight.<ref>Matsumoto, H, E Hirasawa, S Morimura and E Takahashi (1976) Localization of aluminium in tea leaves. Plant Cell Physiol. 17, 627– 631.</ref> Again, machine-harvested tea leaves are thought to be higher in free aluminium than those harvested by hand, since harvesting machines are more likely to inadvertently harvest older leaves during harvest. While large doses of aluminium can cause toxicity in humans{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}, which may even result in death, there is no evidence that consuming any quantity of made tea has had this result.

=== Caffeine ===
The caffeine in tea is a mild [[diuretic]]. However, the [[British Dietetic Association]] has suggested that tea can be used to supplement normal water consumption, and that "the style of tea and coffee and the amounts we drink in the UK are unlikely to have a negative effect [on hydration]".<ref>[http://www.bda.uk.com/news/110610DehydrationWeek.pdf  BDA Supports Dehydration Awareness Week with some Handy Tips]. British Dietetic Association press release, June 2011.</ref>

=== Oxalates ===

Tea contains [[oxalate]], overconsumption of which can cause [[kidney]] stones, as well as binding with free [[calcium]] in the body; other minerals may be bound as well. The [[bioavailability]] of oxalate from tea is low, thus negative effect requires a large intake of tea.<ref>{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1016/j.nutres.2007.04.004    }}</ref>

=== Hot drinking temperature ===

The limited available evidence suggests that drinking a beverage at very high temperature increases the risk of [[esophageal cancer]].<ref name = Islami>{{cite journal |author=Islami F, Boffetta P, Ren JS, Pedoeim L, Khatib D, Kamangar F |title=High-temperature beverages and foods and [[esophageal cancer]] risk--a systematic review |journal=Int.

=== Prostate cancer ===
A 2012 study indicated that men who drink large quantities of [[black tea]] – more than seven cups per day – ''increase'' their risk of [[prostate cancer]] by 50%. Those drinking fewer than seven cups a day showed no increased risk. Independent reviews of this study have found some limitations, including the fact that the study does not record the specific type of black tea consumed, that family histories were incomplete, and that the amount of information on grade-specific prostate cancer was severely limited.<ref name=shaf790>{{Cite paper|author=Kashif Shafiquea, Philip McLooneb, Khaver Qureshic, Hing Leungd, Carole Harta & David S.
