'''Delusional parasitosis''', also known as '''Ekbom's syndrome''',<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="Ekbom">{{cite journal|last=Hinkle |first=N.C. |title=Ekbom Syndrome: a delusional condition of "bugs in the skin"|journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/s11920-011-0188-0 }}</ref> is a form of [[psychosis]] whose victims acquire a strong [[delusion]]al belief that they are infested with [[parasite]]s, whereas in reality no such parasites are present.<ref name="Webb">{{cite journal |author=Webb, J.P., Jr. |year=1993 |title=Case histories of individuals with delusions of parasitosis in southern California and a proposed protocol for initiating effective medical assistance |journal=Bulletin of the Society of Vector Ecologists |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=16–24}}</ref> Very often the imaginary parasites are reported as being "bugs" or insects crawling on or under the skin; in these cases the experience of the sensation known as [[formication]] may provide the basis for this belief.

The alternative name of Ekbom's syndrome derives from Swedish neurologist [[Karl Axel Ekbom]],<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2338|Ekbom's syndrome II}}</ref> who published seminal accounts of the disease in 1937 and 1938. This term is also used interchangeably with [[Wittmaack-Ekbom syndrome]], another name for [[restless legs syndrome]] (RLS). Although delusional parasitosis and RLS were both researched by Ekbom, and RLS sufferers sometimes describe some of their symptoms as if they have, for example, "ants in my veins", they are distinctly different disorders. RLS is a physical condition with physical causes, whereas delusional parasitosis is a false belief.

The false belief of delusional parasitosis stands in contrast to actual cases of parasitosis, such as [[scabies]].

People with delusional parasitosis are likely to ask for help not from psychiatrists but from [[dermatologist]]s, [[veterinarian]]s, [[pest control]] specialists, or [[entomologist]]s<ref name="Ekbom"/>. Because delusional parasitosis is not at all well known to non-specialists, under those circumstances the condition often goes undiagnosed, or may be incorrectly diagnosed.

==Classification==
Delusional parasitosis is divided into primary, secondary functional and secondary organic groups.<ref name=Freinhar1984>{{cite journal |author=Freinhar, Jack P |year=1984 |title= Delusions of parasitosis |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(84)73096-9}}</ref>

===Primary===
In primary delusional parasitosis, the delusions comprise the entire disease entity, there is no additional deterioration of basic mental functioning or idiosyncratic thought processes. The parasitic delusions consist of a single delusional belief regarding some aspect of health. This is also referred to as "monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis",<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>{{Rp|389}} and sometimes as "true" delusional parasitosis. In the DSM-IV, this corresponds with "delusional disorder, somatic type".

===Secondary functional===
Secondary functional delusional parasitosis occurs when the delusions are associated with a psychiatric condition such as [[schizophrenia]] or [[clinical depression]].

===Secondary organic===
Secondary organic delusional parasitosis occurs when the state of the patient is caused by a medical illness or substance (medical or recreational) use. In the DSM-IV this corresponds with "psychotic disorder due to general medical condition". Physical illnesses that can underlie secondary organic delusional parasitosis include: [[hypothyroidism]], [[cancer]], [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[tuberculosis]], [[neurological disorders]], [[vitamin B12 deficiency]], and [[diabetes mellitus]]. Any illness or medication for which [[formication]] is a symptom or side effect can become a trigger or underlying cause of delusional parasitosis.

Other physiological factors which can cause formication and thus can sometimes lead to this condition include: [[menopause]] (i.e. hormone withdrawal); [[allergies]], and drug abuse, including but not limited to [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamine]] (as in [[amphetamine psychosis]]).<ref name=Hinkle/> It appears that many of these physiological factors, as well as environmental factors such as airborne irritants, are capable of inducing a "crawling" sensation in otherwise healthy individuals, however some people become fixated on the sensation and its possible meaning, and this fixation may then develop into delusional parasitosis.<ref name=Hinkle/>

==Presentation==
Details of delusional parasitosis vary among sufferers, but is most commonly described as involving perceived parasites crawling upon or burrowing into the skin, sometimes accompanied by an actual physical sensation (known as [[formication]]).<ref name=Webb/> Sufferers may injure themselves in attempts to be rid of the "parasites". Some are able to induce the condition in others through [[suggestion]], in which case the term ''[[folie à deux]]'' may be applicable.<ref name="Koblenzer">{{cite journal |author=Koblenzer, C.S. |year=1993 |title=The clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of delusions of parasitosis--a dermatologic perspective |journal=Bulletin of the Society of Vector Ecologists |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=6–10}}</ref><ref name="Ekbom"/>

Nearly any marking upon the skin, or small object or particle found on the person or his clothing, can be interpreted as evidence for the parasitic infestation, and sufferers commonly compulsively gather such "evidence" and then present it to medical professionals when seeking help.<ref name=Webb/> This presenting of "evidence" is known as "the matchbox sign" because the "evidence" is frequently presented in a small container, such as a matchbox.<ref name="Ekbom"/>

Delusional parasitosis is seen more commonly in women, and the frequency is much higher past the age of 40.<ref name=Hinkle>{{cite journal |last=Hinkle |first=Nancy C |title=Delusory Parasitosis |journal=American Entomologist |volume=46 |pages=17–25 |year=2000 |url=http://www.ent.uga.edu/pubs/delusory.pdf |format=PDF | issue=1}}</ref><ref name="Ekbom"/>

The peer reviewed [[Dermatology Online Journal]] has recently noted a very rare form of delusional parasitosis called delusional [[tinea]].<ref>http://dermatology.cdlib.org/1412/letters/delusional_tinea/rashid.html</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of secondary forms of delusional parasitosis are addressed by treating the primary associated psychological or physical condition. The primary form is treated much as other [[delusional disorder]]s and [[schizophrenia]]. In the past, [[pimozide]] was the drug of choice when selecting from the [[typical antipsychotic]]s. Currently, [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[olanzapine]] or [[risperidone]] are used as first line treatment.

However, it is also characteristic that sufferers will reject the diagnosis of delusional parasitosis by medical professionals, and very few are willing to be treated, despite demonstrable efficacy of treatment.<ref name=Webb/>

==Delusory cleptoparasitosis==
Delusory cleptoparasitosis is a form of delusion of parasitosis where the sufferer believes the infestation is in their [[dwelling]], rather than on or in their body.<ref name="Grace">{{cite journal |last=Grace |first=Kenneth J |title=Delusory Cleptoparasitosis: Delusions of Arthropod Infestation in the Home |journal=Pan-Pacific Entomologist |volume=63 |pages= 1–4 |year=1987 |format=PDF | issue=1}}</ref>

==Morgellons==
The term "[[Morgellons]]" was introduced by stay-at-home mother Mary Leitao in 2004 to describe a skin condition characterized by a range of [[cutaneous]] (skin) symptoms including crawling, biting, and stinging sensations; finding fibers on or under the skin; and persistent skin lesions (e.g., rashes or sores). A majority of health professionals, including most dermatologists, regard Morgellons as a manifestation of other known medical conditions, including delusional parasitosis<ref name="nature">[http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v12/n9/full/nm0906-982a.html Mysterious 'Morgellons disease' prompts US investigation], Emma Marris, Nature Medicine, 30 August 2006</ref><ref name="Scheinfeld">[http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic939.htm Delusions of Parasitosis] Noah Scheinfeld, May 4, 2007</ref><ref name="AJP">{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Jeffrey |coauthors=Michael B.

==In popular culture==

The film ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II|Hellraiser II]]'' has a scene with a mental patient with this condition, who is given a [[straight razor]] to "remedy" his condition.

In season 3 episode 12 of the television show ''[[The X-Files]]'', Scully mentions this condition in conversation with Mulder.

In season 5 episode 7 of the television show ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', Dr. Wilson diagnoses Dr. House as having delusional parasitosis.

The animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' makes reference to delusional parasitosis in the motto of the Springfield Psychiatric Center: "Because There May Not Be Bugs On You".

The Philip K. Dick novel ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'' contains a character named Jerry Fabin who suffers from intense delusional parasitosis. This detail forms the partly humorous plot of the opening segment of the film adaptation of the story - see ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)]]''.

The play ''[[Bug (play)]]'' and subsequent movie ''[[Bug (2006 film)]]'' are about a couple who experience delusional parasitosis together.

In [[Scott Sigler]]'s novels ''Infected'' and ''Contagious'', skin infestations by alien parasites are discounted as delusional parasitosis, specifically [[Morgellons]].

In the first issue of the comic book ''Hellblazer'', John Constantine's friend believes he is experiencing delusion parasitosis as a result of being a junkie. (As it turns out, he really is covered in insects.) 

In Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', Delirium inflicts a curse on a policeman, giving him delusional parasitosis.

In the ''[[Dark Skies]]'' episode “The Last Wave,” two characters hallucinate insects under their skin as a result of actually having alien bacteria in their bodies.
