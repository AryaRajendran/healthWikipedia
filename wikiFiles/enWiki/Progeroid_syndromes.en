'''Progeroid syndromes''' (PS) are a group of rare [[genetic disorder]]s that mimic [[Physiology|physiological]] [[senescence|aging]], making affected individuals appear to be older than they are. The term ''progeroid syndromes'' should not be confused with [[progeria]], which is itself a type of progeroid syndrome.

All disorders within this group are [[Monogenic (genetics)|monogenic]],<ref name="Navarro">{{cite journal|pmid=16987878|year=2006|last1=Navarro|first1=CL|last2=Cau|first2=P|last3=Lévy|first3=N|title=Molecular bases of progeroid syndromes|volume=15 Spec No 2|pages=R151–61|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddl214|journal=Human molecular genetics}}</ref> meaning they arise from [[mutation]]s of a single [[gene]]. Most known PS are due to genetic mutations that lead to either defects in the [[DNA repair]] mechanism or defects in [[LMNA|lamin A/C]].

''Progeroid'' means "resembling premature aging", a definition that can apply to a broad range of diseases. Familial [[Alzheimer's disease]] and familial [[Parkinson's disease]] are two accelerated aging diseases associated with aged individuals; they affect only one tissue and can be classified as unimodal progeroid syndromes. However, ''progeroid syndrome'' usually refers to segmental progeria, which tends to affect multiple or all tissues and causes affected individuals to exhibit only some of the features associated with aging.

Examples of PS include [[Werner syndrome]] (WS), [[Bloom syndrome]] (BS), [[Rothmund–Thomson syndrome]] (RTS), [[Cockayne syndrome]] (CS), [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] (XP), [[IBIDS syndrome|trichothiodystrophy]] (TTD), combined [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]-[[Cockayne syndrome]] (XP-CS), [[restrictive dermopathy]] (RD), and [[Progeria|Hutchinson-Gilford progeria]] (HGPS). Individuals with these disorders tend to have a reduced lifespan.<ref name="Navarro" /> Progeroid syndromes have been widely studied in the fields of aging, [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], [[stem cell]]s and [[cancer]]. The most widely studied of the progeroid syndromes are Werner syndrome (WS) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), as they are seen to most resemble natural aging.<ref name="Navarro" />

==Defects in DNA repair==
One of the main causes of progeroid syndromes is genetic mutations, which lead to defects in the cellular machinery that [[DNA repair|repairs DNA]]. The [[DNA damage theory of aging]] proposes that aging is a consequence of the accumulation of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|naturally occurring DNA damages]]. These damages may arise from [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), chemical reactions (e.g. with [[intercalating agent]]s), [[radiation]], [[depurination]], and [[deamination]]. The damage may accumulate due to excessive damage or defects in the DNA repair mechanisms.

Mutations in two classes of DNA repair proteins, [[RECQL|RecQ protein-like helicases]] (RECQLs) and [[nucleotide excision repair]] (NER) proteins, have been associated with the following progeroid syndromes:

*Werner syndrome (WS)
*Bloom syndrome (BS)
*Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS)<!--needs a section here-->
*Cockayne syndrome (CS)
*Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)
*Trichothiodystrophy (TTD)

Approximately 90% of individuals with Werner Syndrome have any of a range of mutations in the eponymous gene, [[Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase|WRN]], the only gene currently connected to Werner syndrome.<ref name="ncbi" /> WRN encodes the WRNp protein, a 1432 amino acid protein with a central domain resembling members of the RecQ helicases.

====Bloom syndrome====
{{Main|Bloom syndrome}}
Bloom syndrome (BS) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10823897|year=2000|last1=Karow|first1=JK|last2=Constantinou|first2=A|last3=Li|first3=JL|last4=West|first4=SC|last5=Hickson|first5=ID|title=The Bloom's syndrome gene product promotes branch migration of holliday junctions|volume=97|issue=12|pages=6504–8|doi=10.1073/pnas.100448097|pmc=18638|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}}</ref> Incidence rates are unknown, although is known to be higher in people of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jew]]ish background, presenting in around 1 in 50,000. Approximately one-third of all individuals who have Bloom syndrome are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

Individuals with Bloom syndrome are characterized by low weight and height and abnormal facial features, particularly a long, narrow face with a small lower jaw, a large nose and prominent ears. Most also develop [[Photosensitivity in humans|photosensitivity]], which causes the blood vessels to be [[Vasodilation|dilated]] and leads to reddening of the skin, usually presented as a "butterfly-shaped patch of reddened skin across the nose and cheeks".<ref>{{cite web|title=Bloom syndrome|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bloom-syndrome|work=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>
Other characteristics of Bloom syndrome include [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], an increased risk of [[diabetes]], [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|gastroesophageal reflux]] (GER), and [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). GER may also lead to recurrent [[Upper respiratory tract infection|infections of the upper respiratory tract]], [[Otitis|ears]], and lungs during infancy. Bloom syndrome causes [[infertility]] in males and reduced fertility and early-onset [[menopause]] in females. In line with any RecQ-associated PS, people with BS have an increased risk of developing cancer, often more than one type.

Bloom syndrome is caused by mutations in the BLM gene, which encodes for the [[Bloom syndrome protein]], a RecQ helicase.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16246145|year=2005|last1=Cheok|first1=CF|last2=Bachrati|first2=CZ|last3=Chan|first3=KL|last4=Ralf|first4=C|last5=Wu|first5=L|last6=Hickson|first6=ID|title=Roles of the Bloom's syndrome helicase in the maintenance of genome stability|volume=33|issue=Pt 6|pages=1456–9|doi=10.1042/BST20051456|journal=Biochemical Society transactions}}</ref> These mutations may be [[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]], [[Missense mutation|missense]], [[Nonsense mutation|non-sense]], or mutations of other kinds and are likely to cause deletions in the gene product.<ref name="Pmid_a">{{cite journal|pmid=17407155|year=2007|last1=German|first1=J|last2=Sanz|first2=MM|last3=Ciocci|first3=S|last4=Ye|first4=TZ|last5=Ellis|first5=NA|title=Syndrome-causing mutations of the BLM gene in persons in the Bloom's Syndrome Registry|volume=28|issue=8|pages=743–53|doi=10.1002/humu.20501|journal=Human mutation}}</ref><ref name="Pmid_a" /><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18471088|year=2008|last1=Amor-Guéret|first1=M|last2=Dubois-d'Enghien|first2=C|last3=Laugé|first3=A|last4=Onclercq-Delic|first4=R|last5=Barakat|first5=A|last6=Chadli|first6=E|last7=Bousfiha|first7=AA|last8=Benjelloun|first8=M|last9=Flori|first9=E|title=Three new BLM gene mutations associated with Bloom syndrome|volume=12|issue=2|pages=257–61|doi=10.1089/gte.2007.0119|journal=Genetic testing}}</ref> Apart from helicase activity that is common to all RecQ helices, it also acts to prevent [[homologous recombination]].

===NER protein-associated PS===
{{Further|Nucleotide excision repair}}
Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism. There are three excision repair pathways: nucleotide excision repair (NER), [[base excision repair]] (BER), and [[DNA mismatch repair]] (MMR). Defects in the NER pathway have been linked to progeroid syndromes. In NER, the damaged strand of DNA is removed, but the undamaged strand remains and is used as a template for polymerase to act on to complete the complementary sequence. Finally, the completion of the dsDNA is carried out by [[DNA ligase]]. There are two subpathways for NER, which differ only in their mechanism for recognition: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER).

There are 28 genes in the NER pathway, and individuals with defects in some of these genes often have developmental defects and exhibit [[neurodegeneration]]. They can also develop CS, XP and TTD,<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19809470|year=2009|last1=Cleaver|first1=JE|last2=Lam|first2=ET|last3=Revet|first3=I|title=Disorders of nucleotide excision repair: The genetic and molecular basis of heterogeneity|volume=10|issue=11|pages=756–68|doi=10.1038/nrg2663|journal=Nature reviews.

====Cockayne syndrome====
{{Main|Cockayne syndrome}}
Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive PS. There are three types of CS, distinguished by severity and age of onset. It occurs at a rate of about 1 in 300,000-500,000 in the United States and Europe.<ref name="Pmid_f">{{cite journal|pmid=18329345|year=2008|last1=Kleijer|first1=WJ|last2=Laugel|first2=V|last3=Berneburg|first3=M|last4=Nardo|first4=T|last5=Fawcett|first5=H|last6=Gratchev|first6=A|last7=Jaspers|first7=NG|last8=Sarasin|first8=A|last9=Stefanini|first9=M|title=Incidence of DNA repair deficiency disorders in western Europe: Xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy|volume=7|issue=5|pages=744–50|doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2008.01.014|journal=DNA repair}}</ref>

Individuals with the type I (or classical) form of the disorder usually first show symptoms between one and three years and have lifespans of between 20 and 40 years. Type II Cockayne syndrome (CSB) is more severe: symptoms present at birth and individuals live to approximately 6-7 years of age.<ref name="Navarro" /> Type III has the mildest symptoms, first presents later in childhood,<ref name="ghr_b" /> and the cause of death is often severe nervous system deterioration and respiratory tract infections.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16009385|year=2005|last1=Andressoo|first1=JO|last2=Hoeijmakers|first2=JH|title=Transcription-coupled repair and premature ageing|volume=577|issue=1–2|pages=179–94|doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.04.004|journal=Mutation research}}</ref>

Individuals with CS appear prematurely aged and exhibit severe growth retardation leading to short stature. They have a [[microcephaly|small head]] (less than the -3 standard deviation),<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16428367|year=2006|last1=Pasquier|first1=L|last2=Laugel|first2=V|last3=Lazaro|first3=L|last4=Dollfus|first4=H|last5=Journel|first5=H|last6=Edery|first6=P|last7=Goldenberg|first7=A|last8=Martin|first8=D|last9=Heron|first9=D|title=Wide clinical variability among 13 new Cockayne syndrome cases confirmed by biochemical assays|volume=91|issue=2|pages=178–82|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.080473|pmc=2082700|journal=Archives of disease in childhood}}</ref> fail to gain weight and [[failure to thrive]].

However, they do not have a higher risk of cancer. 

Type I and II are known to be caused by mutation of a specific gene. CSA is caused by mutations in the ''[[ERCC8 (gene)|cross-complementing gene 8]]'' (''ERCC8''), which encodes for the CSA protein.

{{Main|Xeroderma pigmentosum}}
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, affecting about one per million in the United States and [[wikt:autochthonic]] Europe populations<ref name="Pmid_f" /> but with a higher incidence rate in Japan, North Africa, and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xeroderma pigmentosum|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/xeroderma-pigmentosum|work=Genetics Home Reference|publisher=NIH|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref> There has been 830 published cases from 1874 to 1982.<ref name="Pmid_g">{{cite journal|pmid=3545087|year=1987|last1=Kraemer|first1=KH|last2=Lee|first2=MM|last3=Scotto|first3=J|title=Xeroderma pigmentosum.

Xeroderma pigmentosum mostly affects the eye and skin. Individuals with XP have extreme sensitivity to light in the [[ultraviolet]] range starting from one to two years of age.<ref name="Pmid_g" /> and causes [[sunburn]], [[freckle|freckling]] of skin, dry skin and pigmentation after exposure.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19181106|year=2008|last1=Hengge|first1=UR|last2=Emmert|first2=S|title=Clinical features of xeroderma pigmentosum|volume=637|pages=10–8|journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology}}</ref> When the eye is exposed to sunlight, it becomes irritated and [[Red eye (medicine)|bloodshot]], and the [[cornea]] becomes cloudy. Around 30% of affected individuals also develop neurological abnormalities, including [[deafness]], poor coordination, decreased intellectual abilities, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures; these effects tend to become progressively worse over time.

Cancer}}</ref>

There are eight types of XP (XP-A through XP-G), plus a variant type (XP-V), all categorized based on the genetic cause. XP can be caused by mutations in any of these genes: ''[[DDB2]]'', ''[[ERCC2]]'', ''[[XPB|ERCC3]]'', ''[[ERCC4]]'', ''[[ERCC5]]'', ''[[XPA]]'', ''[[XPC (gene)|XPC]]''. These genes are all involved in the NER repair pathway that repairs damaged DNA. The variant form, XP-V, is caused by mutations in the ''[[DNA polymerase eta|POLH]]'' gene, which unlike the rest does not code for components of the NER pathway but produces a DNA polymerase that prevents UV damage in the first place; its mutation leads to an overall increase in UV-dependent DNA damage, which ultimately causes the symptoms of XP.

====Trichothiodystrophy====
{{Main|Trichothiodystrophy}}
Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease whose symptoms span across multiple systems<ref name="Pmid_h">{{cite journal|pmid=18603627|year=2008|last1=Faghri|first1=S|last2=Tamura|first2=D|last3=Kraemer|first3=KH|last4=Digiovanna|first4=JJ|title=Trichothiodystrophy: A systematic review of 112 published cases characterises a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations|volume=45|issue=10|pages=609–21|doi=10.1136/jmg.2008.058743|pmc=3459585|journal=Journal of medical genetics}}</ref> and can vary greatly in severity. The incidence rate of TTD is estimated to be 1.2 per million in Western Europe.<ref name="Pmid_f" /> Milder cases cause sparse and brittle hair, which is due to the lack of [[sulfur]],<ref name="Pmid_i">{{cite journal|pmid=11369901|year=2001|last1=Itin|first1=PH|last2=Sarasin|first2=A|last3=Pittelkow|first3=MR|title=Trichothiodystrophy: Update on the sulfur-deficient brittle hair syndromes|volume=44|issue=6|pages=891–920; quiz 921–4|doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.114294|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology}}</ref> an element that is part of the matrix proteins that give hair its strength.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1071/AR9921337|title=Variations in the strength of wool fibres - A review|year=1992|last1=Reis|first1=PJ|journal=Australian Journal of Agricultural Research|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1337}}</ref> More severe cases cause delayed development, significant intellectual disability, and recurrent infection; the most severe cases see death at infancy or early childhood.

TTD also affects the mother of the affected child during pregnancy, when she may experience [[Pre-eclampsia|pregnancy-induced high blood pressure]] and develop [[HELLP syndrome]]. The baby has a high risk of being born [[Preterm birth|prematurely]] and will have a low [[birth weight]]. After birth, the child's normal growth is retarded, resulting in a short stature.

Other symptoms include [[ichthyosis|scaly skin]], abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, clouding of the lens of the eye from birth ([[congenital]] [[cataracts]]), poor co-ordination, and [[ocular]] and skeletal abnormalities. Half of affected individuals also experience photosensitivity to UV light.<ref name="Pmid_h" />

TTD is caused by mutations in one of three genes, ''ERCC2'', ''ERCC3'', or ''[[GTF2H5]]'', the first two of which are also linked to xeroderma pigmentosum. However, patients with TTD do not show a higher risk of developing skin cancer, in contrast to patients with XP.<ref name="Pmid_i" /> The three genes associated with TTD encode for XPB, XPD and p8/TTDA of the [[Transcription factor II H|general transcription factor IIH]] (TFIIH) complex,<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19808800|year=2009|last1=Hashimoto|first1=S|last2=Egly|first2=JM|title=Trichothiodystrophy view from the molecular basis of DNA repair/transcription factor TFIIH|volume=18|issue=R2|pages=R224–30|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp390|journal=Human molecular genetics}}</ref> which is involved in transcription and DNA damage repair.

A form of TTD without photosensitivity also exists, although its mechanism is unclear. The ''[[MPLKIP]]'' gene has been associated with this form of TTD, although it accounts for only 20% of all known cases of the non-photosensitive form of TTD, and the function of its gene product is also unclear. Mutations in the ''TTDN1'' gene explain another 10% of non-photosensitive TTD.<ref name="Pmid_j">{{cite journal|pmid=19681155|year=2009|last1=Morice-Picard|first1=F|last2=Cario-André|first2=M|last3=Rezvani|first3=H|last4=Lacombe|first4=D|last5=Sarasin|first5=A|last6=Taïeb|first6=A|title=New clinico-genetic classification of trichothiodystrophy|volume=149A|issue=9|pages=2020–30|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.32902|journal=American journal of medical genetics.

Individuals with HGPS typically appear normal at birth, but their growth is severely retarded, resulting in short stature, a very low body weight and delayed tooth eruption. Their facial/cranial proportions and facial features are abnormal, characterized by larger-than-normal eyes, a thin, beaked nose, thin lips, small chin and jaw ([[micrognathia]]), protruding ears, scalp hair, eyebrows, and lashes, [[alopecia|hair loss]], [[macrocephaly|large head]], large [[fontanelle]] and generally appearing aged. Other features include skeletal alterations (osteolysis, osteoporosis), amyotrophy (wasting of muscle), lipodystrophy and skin atrophy (loss of subcutaneous tissue and fat) with sclerodermatous focal lesions, severe atherosclerosis and prominent scalp veins.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10990576|year=2000|last1=Jansen|first1=T|last2=Romiti|first2=R|title=Progeria infantum (Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome) associated with scleroderma-like lesions and acro-osteolysis: A case report and brief review of the literature|volume=17|issue=4|pages=282–5|journal=Pediatric dermatology|doi=10.1046/j.1525-1470.2000.01775.x}}</ref> However, the level of cognitive function, motor skills, and risk of developing cancer is not affected significantly.<ref name="ghr" />

HGPS is caused by sporadic mutations (not inherited from parent) in the ''LMNA'' gene, which encodes for lamin A.<ref name="Doiscience_a" /><ref name="Pmid_d" /> Specifically, most HGPS are caused by a dominant, ''de novo'', point mutation p.G608G (GGC > GGT).<ref name="Pmid_d" /> This mutation causes a splice site within [[exon]] 11 of the pre-mRNA to come into action, leading to the last 150 base pairs of that exon, and consequently, the 50 amino acids near the C-terminus, being deleted.<ref name="Pmid_d" /> This results in a truncated prelamin A precursor (a.k.a.

Normally, lamin A is recognized by ZMPSTE24 (FACE1, a [[metalloprotease]]) and cleaved. After being translated, a [[farnesol]] is added to prelamin A using [[protein farnesyltransferase]]; this farnesylation is important in targeting lamin to the nuclear envelope, where it maintains its integrity.

In the truncated prelamin A precursor, this cleavage is not possible and the prelamin A cannot mature.

===Restrictive dermopathy===
{{main|Restrictive dermopathy}}
Restrictive dermopathy (RD), also called tight skin contracture syndrome, is a rare, lethal autosomal recessive perinatal [[genodermatosis]].<ref name="Doihmgddh">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddh265|title=Lamin a and ZMPSTE24 (FACE-1) defects cause nuclear disorganization and identify restrictive dermopathy as a lethal neonatal laminopathy|year=2004|last1=Navarro|first1=C.

Individuals with RD exhibit growth retardation starting in the [[uterus]], tight and rigid skin with erosions, prominent superﬁcial [[blood vessels|vasculature]] and [[Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis|epidermal hyperkeratosis]], abnormal facial features (small mouth, small pinched nose and micrognathia), sparse or absent eyelashes and eyebrows, mineralization defects of the skull, thin dysplastic clavicles, pulmonary hypoplasia and multiple joint contractures. Most affected individuals die in the uterus or are stillbirths, and liveborns usually die within a week.
