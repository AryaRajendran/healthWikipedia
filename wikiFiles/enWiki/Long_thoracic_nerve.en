The '''long thoracic nerve''' ('''external respiratory nerve of Bell'''; '''posterior thoracic nerve''') supplies the [[Serratus anterior]].  This nerve characteristically arises by three roots from the fifth, sixth, and seventh [[cervical nerves]] (C5-C7) but the root from C7 may be absent. The roots from C5 and C6 pierce the [[Scalenus medius]], while the C7 root passes in front of the muscle. 

The nerve descends behind the [[brachial plexus]] and the axillary vessels, resting on the outer surface of the [[Serratus anterior]]. It extends along the side of the thorax to the lower border of that [[muscle]], supplying filaments to each of its [[Wiktionary: Digitate| digitations]] (finger-like projections).

== Damage ==
Due to its long, relatively superficial course, it is susceptible to injury either through direct trauma or stretch.  Injury has been reported in almost all [[sports]], typically occurring from a blow to the ribs underneath an outstretched arm. The long thoracic nerve can also be damaged during surgery for [[breast cancer]], specifically [[mastectomy|radical mastectomies]] that involve removal of [[axillary lymph nodes]].

Injuries to the nerve can result from carrying heavy bags over the shoulder for a prolonged time. There are also reports of isolated damage to this nerve as a variant of [[Parsonage Turner Syndrome]], an [[autoimmune]] disease.

Symptoms are often minimal â€“ if symptomatic, a posterior shoulder or scapular burning type of pain may be reported. 

A lesion of the nerve paralyses the [[serratus anterior]] to produce [[winged scapula]], which is most prominent when the arm is lifted forward or when the patient pushes the outstretched arm against a wall. However, even winging may not be evident until the [[trapezius]] stretches enough to reveal an injury several weeks later.
