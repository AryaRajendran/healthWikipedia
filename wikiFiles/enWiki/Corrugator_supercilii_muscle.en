The '''Corrugator supercilii''' is a small, narrow, pyramidal muscle, placed at the medial end of the [[eyebrow]], beneath the [[Frontalis muscle|Frontalis]] and just above [[Orbicularis oculi muscle|Orbicularis oculi]]. 

It arises from the medial end of the [[superciliary arch]]; and its fibers pass upward and laterally, between the palpebral and orbital portions of the Orbicularis oculi, and are inserted into the deep surface of the skin, above the middle of the [[orbital arch]].

==Action==
The Corrugator draws the [[eyebrow]] downward and medially, producing the vertical wrinkles of the [[forehead]]. It is the “[[frowning]]” muscle, and may be regarded as the principal muscle in the expression of [[suffering]] <!--{{Fact}} begin-->{{fix

The muscle is sometimes surgically severed or paralysed with [[botulinum toxin]] as a preventive treatment for some types of [[migraine]] or for aesthetic reasons.
