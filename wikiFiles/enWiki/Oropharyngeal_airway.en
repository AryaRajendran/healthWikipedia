An '''oropharyngeal airway''' (also known as an '''oral airway''', '''OPA''' or '''Guedel pattern airway''') is a medical device called an ''airway adjunct'' used to maintain a patent (open) [[airway]]. It does this by preventing the [[tongue]] from covering the [[epiglottis]], which could prevent the person from breathing.  When a person becomes unconscious, the muscles in their jaw relax and allow the tongue to obstruct the airway.<ref name="brady">{{cite book |author=Ed Dickinson; Dan Limmer; O'Keefe, Michael F.; Grant, Harvey D.; Bob Murray |title=Emergency Care (11th Edition) |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2008 |pages=157–9 |isbn=0-13-500524-8 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>

==History and usage==
The oropharyngeal airway was designed by [[Arthur Ernest Guedel|Arthur Guedel]].<ref>Guedel A. E. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1933, 100, 1862 (reprinted in “Classical File”, Survey of Anesthesiology 1966,10, 515)</ref>

Oropharyngeal airways come in a variety of sizes, from infant to adult, and are used commonly in pre-hospital emergency care and for short term airway management post anaesthetic or when manual methods are inadequate to maintain an open airway.  This piece of equipment is utilized by [[certified first responder]]s, [[emergency medical technician]]s, and [[paramedics]] - plus other health professionals when [[tracheal intubation]] is either not available, not advisable or the problem is of short term duration.

Oropharyngeal airways are indicated only in [[coma|unconscious]] people, because of the likelihood that the device would stimulate a gag reflex in conscious or semi-conscious persons. This could result in [[vomiting|vomit]] and potentially lead to an obstructed airway. [[Nasopharyngeal airway]]s are mostly used instead as they do not stimulate a gag reflex.
In general oropharyngeal airways need to be sized and inserted correctly to maximise effectiveness and minimise possible complications - such as oral trauma.

==Insertion==
[[Image:Canule de Goedel 2.jpg|right|thumb|OP airways in varying sizes]]
	
The correct size OPA is chosen by measuring from the middle of the person's mouth to the angle of the jaw. The airway is then inserted into the person's mouth upside down. Once contact is made with the back of the throat, the airway is rotated 180 degrees, allowing for easy insertion, and assuring that the tongue is secured. An alternative method for insertion, the method that is recommended for OPA use in children and infants, involves holding the tongue forward with a [[Medical device|tongue depressor]] and inserting the airway right side up.<ref name="brady"/> 

The device is removed when the person regains [[swallow reflex]] and can protect their own airway, or is it is substituted for an [[advanced airway]].  Simply remove by pulling on it without rotation.<ref name="brady"/>

==Usage==
Use of an OPA does not remove the need for the [[recovery position]] and ongoing assessment of the airway and it does not prevent obstruction by liquids (blood, saliva, food, cerebrospinal fluid) or the closing of the [[glottis]]. But can facilitate ventilation during CPR ([[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]) and for persons with a large tongue.

==Key risks of use==
The mains risks of its use are:<ref>http://www.northcoastems.com/policies/6028.html NORTH COAST EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES </ref>

* if the person has a gag-reflex they may vomit
* when it is too large, it can close the glottis and thus close the airway
* improper sizing can cause bleeding in the airway
