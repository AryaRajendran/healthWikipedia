'''Atorvastatin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˌ|t|ɔr|v|ə|ˈ|s|t|æ|t|ən}}), marketed by [[Pfizer]] as a calcium salt under the trade name '''Lipitor''',<ref name="LiptHome"/> is a member of the drug class known as [[statin]]s, used for lowering blood [[cholesterol]]. It also stabilizes [[Atheroma|plaque]] and prevents strokes through anti-inflammatory and other mechanisms. Like all statins, atorvastatin works by inhibiting [[HMG-CoA reductase]], an [[enzyme]] found in [[liver]] tissue that plays a key role in production of cholesterol in the body.

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by [[Bruce Roth]] of Parke-Davis Warner-Lambert Company (now [[Pfizer]]). The best selling drug in pharmaceutical history, sales of Lipitor since it was approved in 1996 exceed US$125&nbsp;billion, and the drug has topped the [[list of bestselling drugs|list of best-selling branded pharmaceuticals]] in the world for nearly a decade.<ref name="url_Crain's_2011"/> When Pfizer's patent on Lipitor expired on November 30, 2011,<ref>{{cite news |title=Lipitor loses patent, goes generic |author=CNN Wire Staff |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/30/health/lipitor-generic/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=November 30, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}</ref> generic atorvastatin became available in the United States, initially manufactured only by generic drugmakers [[Watson Pharmaceuticals]] and India's [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]]. Prices for the generic version did not drop to the level of other generics—$10 or less for a month's supply—until other manufacturers were able to supply the drug in May 2012.<ref>[http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/2012---May/30/June-Drug-Tariff-Reduced-prices-for-atorvastatin/ NeLM, June 2012: Price to UK [[National Health Service]] for 28 tablets from £3.25 (10mg) to £10.00 (80mg).]</ref>

==Medical uses==
The primary uses of atorvastatin is for the treatment of [[dyslipidemia]] and the prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name="AHFS"/> It is recommended to be used only after other measures such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction have not improved cholesterol levels.<ref name="AHFS"/>

===Dyslipidemia===
*[[Hypercholesterolemia]]<ref name="pmid12915827"/> ([[Familial hypercholesterolemia#Heterozygous FH|heterozygous familial and nonfamilial]]) and mixed [[dyslipidemia]] ([[Fredrickson classification#Type IIa|Fredrickson types IIa]] and [[Fredrickson classification#Type IIb|IIb]]) to reduce total [[cholesterol]], [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-C]],<ref name="Nissen_2006"/> [[Apolipoprotein B|apo-B]],<ref name="pmid7749881"/> [[triglyceride]]s<ref name="pmid8531308"/> levels, and [[C-reactive protein|CRP]]<ref name="pmid16908955"/> as well as increase [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] levels.

*[[Familial hypercholesterolemia#Heterozygous FH|Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia]]<ref name="pmid12915827" /> in [[pediatrics|pediatric]] patients

*[[Familial hypercholesterolemia#Homozygous FH|Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia]]<ref name="pmid12915827" /><ref name="pmid9301631"/>

*Hypertriglyceridemia ([[Fredrickson classification#Hyperlipoproteinemia type IV|Fredrickson Type IV]])

*Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia ([[Fredrickson classification#Hyperlipoproteinemia type III|Fredrickson Type III]])

*[[Combined hyperlipidemia]]<ref name="AMH_2006"/>

===Cardiovascular disease===
*Secondary prevention in people with [[coronary disease|coronary heart disease]] and multiple risk factors for [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[unstable angina]],<ref name="pmid12686036"/><ref name="pmid12829554"/> and [[revascularization]]<ref name="Wilson_2008"/><ref name="pmid9514454"/>
*Myocardial infarction and stroke prophylaxis in patients with [[type II diabetes]]<ref name="pmid15325833"/><ref name="pmid17065671"/><ref name="pmid11225965"/>

Concomitant therapy considerations: may be used in combination with bile acid [[Ion-exchange resin|resins]]. It is not recommended to combine statin treatment with [[fibrate]]s because of the increased risk of [[myopathy]]-related adverse reactions.<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" /> Drug dose must be adjusted according to age of patient, and must be lowered in [[liver failure|hepatic insufficiency]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Contraindications==
*Active liver disease: [[cholestasis]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]], [[hepatitis]], and [[jaundice]]
*Unexplained elevations in [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] or [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] levels
*[[Pregnancy]]
*[[Breastfeeding]]

Precaution must be taken when treating with atorvastatin, because rarely it may lead to [[rhabdomyolysis]],<ref name="pmid16765141"/> and it may be very serious leading to [[Acute kidney injury|acute renal failure]] due to [[myoglobinuria]]. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately.<ref name="pmid12036392" /> However, trials show atorvastatin may be protective of kidney function.<ref name="AutoYG-3"/> Also, atorvastatin should be discontinued if a patient has markedly elevated [[Creatine kinase|CPK]] levels or if a myopathy is suspected or diagnosed. The likelihood of developing a [[myopathy]] is increased by the co-administration of [[cyclosporine]], [[Fibrate|fibric acid derivatives]], [[erythromycin]], [[niacin]], and [[azole]] [[antifungal medication|antifungals]].<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />

Atorvastatin is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy; it is likely to cause harm to fetal development because of the importance of cholesterol and various products in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway for fetal development, including steroid synthesis and cell membrane production. [[breastfeeding|Nursing mothers]] are not recommended to take atorvastatin due to the possibility of adverse reactions in nursing [[infant]]s, since experiments with rats indicate atorvastatin is likely to be secreted into [[human breast milk]].<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />

==Adverse effects==
As stated earlier, [[myopathy]] with elevation of creatinine kinase (CK)<ref name="pmid8463436" /> and [[rhabdomyolysis]] are the most serious side effects, although rare at <1%.<ref name="AMH_2006" /><ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" /> [[Headache]] is the most common side effect, occurring in more than 10% of patients.
Side effects that occur in 1–10% of patients taking atorvastatin include:
*[[Weakness]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Insomnia]] and [[dizziness]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Chest pain]] and [[peripheral edema]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Rash]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Abdominal pain]], [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[dyspepsia]], [[flatulence]], [[nausea]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Urinary tract infection]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Arthralgia]], [[myalgia]], [[back pain]], [[arthritis]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Sinusitis]], [[pharyngitis]], [[bronchitis]], [[rhinitis]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />
*[[Infection]], [[Influenza-like illness|flu-like syndrome]], [[allergy|allergic reaction]]<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf" />

Atorvastatin and other statins are associated with anecdotal reports of [[memory loss]] by consumers, which have been seen in clinical practice in a tiny percentage of users, particularly women. Evidence is conflicting with anecdotal reports contrasting with a well-established association of high cholesterol with dementia. However, it is known that cholesterol synthesis is necessary for normal neuron functioning. According to Pfizer, the manufacturer of Lipitor, clinical trials "do not establish a causal link between Lipitor and memory loss."<ref name="pmid12885101"/><ref name="AutoYG-5"/><ref name="AutoYG-6"/>

Elevation of [[alanine transaminase]] (ALT) and [[aspartate transaminase]] (AST) has been described in a few cases.<ref name="pmid12036392" /><ref name="pmid8463436" />

High-dose atorvastatin had also been associated with worsening glycemic control.<ref name="pmid20507274">{{cite journal | author = Kostapanos MS, Liamis GL, Milionis HJ, Elisaf MS | title = Do statins beneficially or adversely affect glucose homeostasis? | journal = Curr Vasc Pharmacol | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 612–31 | year = 2010 | month = September | pmid = 20507274 | doi = 10.2174/157016110792006879 }}</ref>

===Drug and food interactions===

Interactions with clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, which are fibrates used in accessory therapy in many forms of [[hypercholesterolemia]], usually in combination with statins, increase the risk of [[myopathy]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name="pmid8463436"/><ref name="pmid18158710"/><ref name="Graham2004"/>

Co-administration of atorvastatin with one of [[CYP3A4]] inhibitors such as [[itraconazole]],<ref name="pmid11061579"/> [[telithromycin]], and [[voriconazole]], may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less likely to happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as [[diltiazem]], [[erythromycin]], [[fluconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[clarithromycin]], [[cyclosporine]], [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]], or [[verapamil]],<ref name="pmid17178259"/> and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as [[amiodarone]] and [[aprepitant]].<ref name="pmid12036392" /> Often, [[bosentan]], [[fosphenytoin]], and [[phenytoin]], which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, [[barbiturate]]s, [[carbamazepine]], [[efavirenz]], [[nevirapine]], [[oxcarbazepine]], [[rifampicin|rifampin]], and [[rifamycin]],<ref name="pmid16084850"/> which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.<ref name="AutoYG-7"/>

[[Antacid]]s can rarely decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, but do not affect the [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-C]]-lowering [[efficacy]].

[[Niacin]] also is proved to increase the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.<ref name="pmid12036392" />

Statins may also alter the concentrations of other drugs, such as [[warfarin]] or [[digoxin]], leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring.<ref name="pmid12036392" />

[[Vitamin D]] supplementation lowers atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations, yet [[synergy|synergistically]] reduces LDL and total [[cholesterol]] concentrations.<ref name="pmid18754003"/> [[Grapefruit juice]] components are known inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A4. Co-administration of grapefruit juice with atorvastatin may cause an increase in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] and AUC, which can lead to adverse reactions or overdose toxicity.<ref name="Kane2000"/>

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main|Statin}}

As with other statins, atorvastatin is a competitive [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Unlike most others, however, it is a completely [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway|3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A]] (HMG-CoA) to [[mevalonate]], which is the [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting step]] in hepatic [[cholesterol]] biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors ([[LDL receptor]]s) on [[hepatocyte]]s. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, atorvastatin also reduces blood levels of [[triglyceride]]s and slightly increases levels of [[High density lipoprotein|HDL-cholesterol]].

In clinical trials, drugs that block cholesterol uptake like [[ezetimibe]] combine with and complement those that block biosynthesis like atorvastatin or [[simvastatin]] in lowering cholesterol or targeting levels of LDL.<ref name="pmid20425579"/><ref name="pmid20487050"/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Atorvastatin undergoes rapid absorption when taken orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration ([[Transport maximum|T<sub>max</sub>]]) of 1–2 h. The absolute [[bioavailability]] of the drug is about 14%, but the systemic availability for [[HMG-CoA reductase]] activity is approximately 30%. Atorvastatin undergoes high intestinal clearance and [[first-pass metabolism]], which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of atorvastatin with food produces a 25% reduction in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] (rate of absorption) and a 9% reduction in [[Integral|AUC]] (extent of absorption), although food does not affect the plasma [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-C]]-lowering [[efficacy]] of atorvastatin. Evening dose administration is known to reduce the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC by 30% each. However, time of administration does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin.

Atorvastatin is highly protein bound (≥98%).

The primary proposed mechanism of atorvastatin [[metabolism]] is through [[cytochrome P450]] [[CYP3A4|3A4]] [[hydroxylation]] to form active ortho- and parahydroxylated [[metabolites]], as well as various [[beta-oxidation]] metabolites. The ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites are responsible for 70% of systemic [[HMG-CoA reductase]] activity. The ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further metabolism via [[glucuronidation]]. As a substrate for the CYP3A4 isozyme, it has shown susceptibility to inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 to produce increased or decreased plasma concentrations, respectively. This interaction was tested ''in vitro'' with concurrent administration of [[erythromycin]], a known CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitor, which resulted in increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. It is also an inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4.

Atorvastatin is primarily eliminated via [[hepatic]] [[biliary]] excretion, with less than 2% recovered in the [[urine]]. [[Bile]] elimination follows hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism. There does not appear to be any [[enterohepatic circulation|entero-hepatic recirculation]]. Atorvastatin has an approximate elimination [[half-life]] of 14 h. Noteworthy, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity appears to have a half-life of 20–30 h, which is thought to be due to the active metabolites. Atorvastatin is also a substrate of the intestinal [[P-glycoprotein]] efflux transporter, which pumps the drug back into the intestinal lumen during drug absorption.<ref name="pmid12036392"/>

In [[liver failure|hepatic insufficiency]], plasma drug concentrations are significantly affected by concurrent liver disease. Patients with A-stage liver disease show a four-fold increase in both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC. Patients with B-stage liver disease show a 16-fold increase in C<sub>max</sub> and an 11-fold increase in AUC.

[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] patients (>65 years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin compared to young adults, with mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values that are 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly patients show a greater pharmacodynamic response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses.<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf"/>

==Pharmacogenetics==
Several genetic [[polymorphisms]] have been found to be associated with a higher incidence of undesirable side effects of atorvastatin. This phenomenon is suspected to be related to increased plasma levels of pharmacologically active metabolites, such as atorvastatin lactone and p-hydroxyatorvastatin. Atorvastatin and its active metabolites may be monitored in potentially susceptible patients using specific chromatographic techniques.<ref name="pmid22368281"/>

==Drug recall==
On 23 November 2012, Indian drugmaker [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]] Ltd. voluntarily recalled 10-, 20- and 40-mg doses of its generic version of atorvastatin in the United States, a development that could further dent its image in the world's largest prescription drug market, in which the company faced an earlier ban. (The 80-mg dose of atorvastatin was not recalled.) Controlled by Japan's [[Daiichi Sankyo Co.]], Ranbaxy has had a troubled history in the United States, where in 2009 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned shipments from some of its manufacturing plants to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Generic form of Lipitor recalled|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-generic-form-of-lipitor-recalled-20121123,0,1717674.story|publisher=Chicago Tribune|year=2012|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>
