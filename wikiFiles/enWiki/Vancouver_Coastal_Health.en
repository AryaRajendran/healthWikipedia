'''Vancouver Coastal Health''' ('''VCH''') is a regional health authority providing direct and contracted health services including primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary care, home and community care, mental health services, population and preventive health and addictions services in part of Greater Vancouver and the Coast Garibaldi area.

VCH is one of six publicly funded [[healthcare]] regions within the [[Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]]. The Provincial Government of British Columbia, through the [[Ministry of Health (British Columbia)|British Columbia Ministry of Health]], sets province-wide goals, standards and performance agreements for health service delivery by the six health authorities.

==Service area==
VCH serves the one in four of British Columbia’s four-million population who live in a geographic area of 58,560 square kilometres including 12 municipalities, four regional districts and 14 Aboriginal communities, including: 

*[[Vancouver]] 
*[[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] (within Greater Vancouver))
*[[The North Shore]] (The municipalities and districts of North and West Vancouver, within Greater Vancouver)
*Coast-Garibaldi (Sea-to-Sky (including Whistler), Sunshine Coast, Powell River, Bella Bella and Bella Coola).

Vancouver Coastal Health administers 13 hospitals and 3 diagnostic and treatment centers and 15 community health centers and more than 500 facilities provide a range of direct and contracted services including home and community care, mental health services, population and preventive health, addictions services and primary care.

VCH is not responsible for all health care within its geographic service area. Other hospitals such as [[BC Children's Hospital]], [http://www.bcwomens.ca BC Women's Hospital & Health Centre], and agencies such as the [[BC Cancer Agency]] are operated by the [[Provincial Health Services Authority]].
