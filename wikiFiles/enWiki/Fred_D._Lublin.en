'''Fred D. Lublin, M.D.''' is an [[United States|American]] [[neurologist]] and a renowned authority on the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]]. Along with colleagues at the [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]], his work has redefined the clinical course definitions of MS.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8780061 Lublin, F.D. and Reingold, S.C. ''Defining the Clinical Course of Multiple Sclerosis: Results of an International Survey.'']  Neurology 46:907-911, 1996.</ref>

Lublin is Director of the [[Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in [[New York City|New York]] and Saunders Family Professor of Neurology at [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]]. He sits on the Board of Directors at both the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and MS Hope for a Cure and has been listed in "Who's Who in Frontiers of Science and Technology" and [[New York Magazine|New York Magazine's]] "Best Doctors" issue every year since 2000.<ref>[http://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-the-society/board-of-directors/index.aspx National Multiple Sclerosis Society]</ref><ref>[http://www.mshopeforacure.org/board.php MS Hope for a Cure: Board of Directors]</ref><ref>[http://www.castleconnolly.com/doctors/full.cfm?source=nymetro&doctorID=80CC006124 New York Magazine: Best Doctors, Fred D.

In 2004, Lublin secured one of the largest grants ever given for MS research, a $25 million grant from the NIH, to study the benefits of [[Combination therapy|combination drug therapy]].<ref>[http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/11/22/S34/1/ The Scientist]</ref> He is a consultant to the [[National Institutes of Health]] and to pharmaceutical/biotech companies in all phases of drug development in preparation for presentation to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and their advisory panels.

He is the author of numerous scientific publications including ''Defining the Clinical Course of Multiple Sclerosis: Results of an International Survey'' ([[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]] 46:907-911, 1996 PMID 8780061), one of the most frequently cited works in the field of multiple sclerosis.<ref>[http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/46/4/907 The American Academy of Neurology]</ref>

==Biography==
Lublin was born in 1946 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania|Pa]]. He graduated from [[Temple University]] in 1968 and [[Jefferson Medical College]] in 1972. He completed his internship in [[internal medicine]] at the [[Albert Einstein Medical Center|Bronx Municipal Hospital, Albert Einstein Medical Center]] and his residency at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University|New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center]]. 

He joined the staff at Mount Sinai Medical Center in April 2000.

Lublin was among the first in the United States to study [[Interferon beta-1b|Interferon β-1b]] and its ability to treat the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis; in 1993, IFN β-1b was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] for that very purpose.<ref>[http://www.multiplesclerosisprofessional.org/node/47 Multiple Sclerosis Pro – A Resource Center for Clinicians]</ref>

He is the author of nineteen chapters, 136 publications and one text, and is a member of dozens of medical societies including: the National Multiple Sclerosis Society; the MSSM General Clinical Research Center Advisory Committee; and the Executive Committee of the International Medical & Scientific Board of the [[Multiple Sclerosis International Federation]].
