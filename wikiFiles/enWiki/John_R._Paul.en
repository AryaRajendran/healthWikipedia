'''John Rodman Paul''' (April 18, 1893 &ndash; May 6, 1971) was an American [[virology|virologist]] whose research focused on the spread of [[polio]] and the development of treatments for the disease. 

==Life and achievements==
Paul was born on April 18, 1893, in [[Philadelphia]]. He earned his [[undergraduate degree]] in 1915 from [[Princeton University]] and received his medical training at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], which awarded him an M.D. degree.<ref name=NYTObit>Staff. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0714F83D5D117B93C5A9178ED85F458785F9 "Dr. John Paul, Polio Researcher, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 7, 1971. Accessed September 27, 2010.</ref> He began his career as an assistant pathologist at Johns Hopkins in 1919 and 1920, and followed that with an [[internship (medicine)|internship]] at [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] in Philadelphia from 1920 to 1922.<ref name=NYTObit/>

In 1928, Paul joined the faculty of the [[Yale School of Medicine]] in 1928 as a professor of [[internal medicine]] and held the position of professor of [[preventive medicine]] starting in 1940, which he retained until his retirement.<ref name=NYTObit/> Paul established the Yale Poliomyelitis Study Unit in 1931 together with Dr. James D. Trask, advancing the concept of "clinical epidemiology" in which the path of disease outbreaks in small communities was directly studied.<ref name=Yale/> Together with Trask, Paul received the first grant from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (better known as the [[March of Dimes]]), which was renewed each year for another 30 years.<ref name=NYTObit/> As part of the study unit, Paul went to [[Middletown, Connecticut]] and New Haven into neighborhoods where polio was spreading and collected samples from patients in an effort to understand how the virus spread.<ref name=Yale/> Paul's team found that [[poliovirus]] was excreted by people afflicted with the condition and could be found in sewage in areas that had experienced outbreaks.<ref name=NYTObit/> In a 1951 article published in ''The New York Times Magazine'' in 1951, Paul noted the improvements that had been made in treating and relieving pain in those afflicted with polio, but lamented the lack of progress in prevention of polio. He travelled to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1956 as part of a group of five doctors who visited medical facilities there.<ref name=NYTObit/> 

Paul's research also included work on [[hepatitis]], [[infectious mononucleosis]] and [[rheumatic fever]]. After his retirement from the medical school in 1961 he continued to lecture on the history of medicine. As a member of the polio advisory committee of the [[United States Public Health Service]], Paul joined in a 1962 recommendation that the use of an oral polio vaccine created by Dr. [[Albert B. Sabin]] in treating adults should be halted based on the lack of clinical evidence showing that the vaccine prevented those receiving the vaccine from developing the disease.<ref name=NYTObit/> In his 1971 book ''A History of Poliomyelitis'', Paul put forth the proposition that humans had always been exposed to [[poliovirus]] but had been protected by antibodies contained in the mothers milk, and that it was the clean water, sewer systems and improved hygiene of modern civilization that prevented children from being exposed to the virus at an early age, hypothesizing that protection would be conferred if people were exposed to the virus as infants.<ref>[[Wendy Orent|Orent, Wendy]].

Accessed September 27, 2010.</ref>

A resident of the [[New Haven, Connecticut]] suburb of [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], Paul died at age 78 on May 6, 1971, at [[Yale – New Haven Hospital]] after what ''[[The New York Times]]'' described in his obituary as a "long illness".<ref name=NYTObit/>
