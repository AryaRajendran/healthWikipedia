In the [[Soviet Union]], systematic [[political abuse of psychiatry]] took place.<ref>{{harvnb|Gershman|1984}}; {{harvnb|Merskey|1978}}; {{harvnb|Knapp|2007|p=406}}; {{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Society for International Development|1984|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Lisle|2010|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Kutchins|Kirk|1997|p=293}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2002}}; {{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=490}}; {{harvnb|Finckenauer|1995|p=52}}</ref> Psychiatry of the [[Brezhnev]] period  was used as a tool to eliminate political opponents  ("dissidents"), people who openly expressed their views that contradict officially declared dogmas.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=17|ps=}} In case the person did not agree with the specific actions of people in leading positions and criticized them by using philosophic dogmas according to the writings by [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], the term "philosophical intoxication" was widely used to diagnose mental disorders.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=15|ps=}} This method was also employed against religious prisoners and most especially against well-educated former atheists who adopted a religion. In such cases their religious faith was determined to be a form of mental illness that needed to be cured.{{sfn|Pospielovsky|1988|pp=36, 140, 156, 178–181|ps=}} Formerly highly classified extant documents from "Special file" of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] published after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] demonstrate that the authorities of the country quite consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.{{sfn|Gluzman|2009a|ps=}}

Following the fall of the Soviet Union, it was often reported that some opposition activists and journalists were detained in Russian psychiatric institutions in order to intimidate and isolate them from society.<ref>{{harvnb|Washington Times|2007}}; {{harvnb|Blomfield|2007}}; {{harvnb|Finn|2006}}; {{harvnb|Gee|2007}}; {{harvnb|Nyquist|2009}}; {{harvnb|Rodriguez|2007}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|2007}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|2010}}; {{harvnb|Volchek|2010}}</ref> In modern Russia, human rights activists also face the threat of psychiatric diagnosis as a means of political repression.{{sfn|NPZ|2005|ps=}}

== Background ==
{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}
Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society.<ref>{{harvnb|Voren|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=491}}</ref> It entails the certification and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{harvnb|Gluzman|2009b}}; {{harvnb|Gluzman|2010a}}</ref> Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms "Soviet political psychiatry"<ref>{{harvnb|Munro|2002|p=179}}; {{harvnb|Kadarkay|1982|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Rejali|2009|p=395}}; {{harvnb|Smythies|1973}}; {{harvnb|Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals|1983|p=179}}</ref>  or "punitive psychiatry" to refer to this phenomenon.<ref>{{harvs|txt|last=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2005b}}; {{harvnb|Magalif|2010}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|pp=60, 77}}; {{harvnb|Pukhovsky|2001|pp=243, 252}}; {{harvnb|Ball|Farr|1984|p=258}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|pp=292, 293, 294}}; {{harvnb|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|1980|pp=10, 57, 136}}; {{harvnb|Voren|Bloch|1989|pp=92, 95, 98}}; {{harvnb|Vitaliev|1991|p=148}}; {{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}</ref>

In the book ''Punitive Medicine'' by [[Alexander Podrabinek]], the term "punitive medicine", which is identified with "punitive psychiatry," is defined as "a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means."{{sfn|Podrabinek|1980|p=63|ps=}} Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is a disciplinary function arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to service the diktats of power.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a|ps=}} Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression{{sfn|Bonnie|2002|ps=}} and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.<ref>{{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226|ps=}}; {{harvnb|Alexéyeff|1976}}</ref>

In the Soviet Union [[dissident]]s were often confined in the so-called ''psikhushka'', or psychiatric wards.{{sfn|Matvejević|2004|p=32|ps=}} ''Psikhushka'' is the [[Russian language|Russian]] ironic diminutive for "mental hospital".{{sfn|Hunt|1998|p=xii|ps=}} One of the first ''psikhushkas'' was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of [[Kazan]]. In 1939 it was transferred to the control of the [[NKVD]], the secret police and the precursor organization to the [[KGB]], under the order of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who was the head of the NKVD.{{sfn|Birstein|2004|ps=}} International [[human rights defenders]] such as [[Walter Reich]] have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in ''Psikhushka'' hospitals diagnosed [[schizophrenia]] in political dissenters.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14|ps=}} Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=292|ps=}}

As early as 1948, the Soviet secret service took an interest in this area of medicine.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402|ps=}} It was one of the superiors of the [[Soviet secret police]], [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], who first ordered the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=495|ps=}} Russian psychiatrist [[Pyotr Gannushkin]] also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive.<ref>{{harvnb|Vasilenko|2004|p=29|ps=}}; {{harvnb|Chernosvitov|2002|p=50|ps=}}</ref> A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime.{{sfn|Keukens|Voren|2007|ps=}} However, according to Alexander Etkind, punitive psychiatry was not simply an inheritance from the Stalin era as the [[GULAG]] (the [[acronym]] for Chief Administration for Corrective Labor Camps, the penitentiary system in the Stalin years) was an effective instrument of political repression and there was no compelling requirement to develop an alternative and expensive psychiatric substitute.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72|ps=}} The abuse of psychiatry was a natural product of the later Soviet era.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72|ps=}} From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, the structure of mental health service conformed to the double standard in society, that of two separate systems which peacefully co-existed despite conflicts between them:
# the first system was punitive psychiatry that straight served the institute of power and was led by the [[Serbsky Institute|Moscow Institute for Forensic Psychiatry]] named after [[Vladimir Serbsky]];
# the second system was composed of elite, psychotherapeutically oriented clinics and was led by the [[Leningrad Psychoneurological Institute]] named after [[Vladimir Bekhterev]].{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72|ps=}}
The hundreds of hospitals in the provinces combined components of both systems.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72|ps=}}

"In recent years in our country a number of court orders have been made involving the placing in psychiatric hospitals ("of special type" and otherwise) of people who in the opinion of their relatives and close friends are mentally healthy. These people are: Grigorenko, Rips, Gorbanevskaya, Novodvorskaya, Yakhimovich, Gershuni, Fainberg, Victor Kuznetsov, Iofe, V. Borisov and others – people well known for their initiative in defence of civil rights in the U.S.S.R.

This phenomenon arouses justified anxiety, especially in view of the widely publicized placing of the biologist Zhores Medvedev in a psychiatric hospital by extrajudical means.{{hidden begin}}
The diagnoses of the psychiatrists who have served as expert witnesses in court, and on whose diagnoses the court orders are based, provoke many doubts as regards their content. However, only specialists in psychiatry can express authoritative opinions about the degree of legitimacy of these diagnoses.

Taking advantage of the fact that I have managed to obtain exact copies of the diagnostic reports made by the forensic-psychiatric groups who examined Grigorenko, Fainberg, Gorbanevskaya, Borisov and Yakhimovich, and also extracts from the diagnosis on V. Kuznetsov, I am sending you these documents, and also various letters and other material which reveal the character of these people. I will be very grateful to you if you can study this material and express your opinion on it.

I realize that at a distance and without the essential clinical information it is very difficult to determine the mental condition of a person and either to diagnose an illness or assert the absence of any illness. Therefore I ask you to express your opinion on only this point: do the above-mentioned diagnoses contain enough scientifically-based evidence not only to indicate the mental illnesses described in the diagnoses, but also to indicate the necessity of isolating these people completely from society?

I will be very happy if you can interest your colleagues in this matter and if you consider it possible to place it on the agenda for discussion at the next International Congress of Psychiatrists. 

For a healthy person there is no fate more terrible than indefinite internment in a mental hospital. I believe that you will not remain indifferent to this problem and will devote a portion of your time to it – just as physicists find time to combat the use of the achievements of their science in ways harmful to mankind.

Thanking you in advance,

V. Bukovsky"

— Bukovsky's 1971 letter addressed to western psychiatrists<ref>{{harvnb|Richter|1971|ps=}}; see the Russian text of the letter in: {{harvnb|Artyomova|Rar|Slavinsky|1971|p=470|ps=}}</ref>
}}

In the 1960-s, a vigorous movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.{{sfn|Fernando|2003|p=160|ps=}} In 1971, [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] smuggled to the West a file of 150 pages documenting the political abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496|ps=}} The documents were photocopies of forensic reports on prominent Soviet dissidents.{{sfn|Psychiatric News|2010|ps=}} These documents were attended with a letter by Bukovsky requesting Western psychiatrists to explore the six cases documented in the file and tell whether these persons should be hospitalized or not.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}} The documents were sent by Bukovsky to ''[[The Times]]'' and, when translated by The Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Medical Hospitals, were examined by forty-four psychiatrists from the Department of Psychiatry, [[Sheffield University]].{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=101|ps=}} The psychiatrists described the documents in ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' of August 1971{{sfn|Richter|1971|ps=}} and wrote a letter to ''The Times''.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=101|ps=}} In this letter published on 16 September 1971, they reported that four of the six dissidents manifested no signs or history of mental disease, and the other two had minor psychiatric problems many years ago, quite removed from the events related to their internment.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=101|ps=}} The group of British psychiatrists concluded: "It seems to us that the diagnoses on the six people were made purely in consequence of actions in which they were exercising fundamental freedoms...".{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}} They recommended discussing the issue in the course of the forthcoming [[World Psychiatric Association]] (WPA) World Congress in [[Mexico]] in November 1971.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}}

== Congress in Mexico City ==
The Congress in Mexico City was held on 28 November&nbsp;— 4 December 1971. The statement of the forty-four British psychiatrists was circulated to the 7000 delegates in English, Spanish, and French.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=103|ps=}} There were statements from the Soviet Human Rights Committee describing the part played by Snezhnevsky, a head of the Soviet delegation, in the Medvedev case.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=103|ps=}} When speakers demanded that the Congress go on record against the confinement of dissidents in psychiatric hospitals, the Soviet delegation and Snezhnevsky instantly walked out.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=103|ps=}} They said that they could not talk about the issue since the Congress lacked official interpretation into Russian.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=103|ps=}} At this congress, Western psychiatrists tried to censure their Soviet colleagues for the first time.{{sfn|Reich|1983|ps=}} But the charges of psychiatric abuse were new, the campaign was disorganized, and Snezhnevsky, who headed the Soviet delegation, remained unscathed.{{sfn|Reich|1983|ps=}} He said in rebuttal that the accusations were a "cold-war maneuver carried out at the hands of experts."{{sfn|Reich|1983|ps=}} The WPA General Secretary [[Denis Leigh]] said that the WPA was under no obligation to accept complaints from one member society directed against another member society, and he informed Snezhnevsky of the complaints and sent him the "Bukovsky Papers."{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}} Leigh proposed to constitute a committee for considering the ethical aspects of psychiatric practice, but also in this instance the issue of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was not mentioned.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}}

One of the key apologists of Soviet psychiatric abuse, Soviet psychiatrist [[Marat Vartanyan]], was chosen as associate secretary of the Executive Committee.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}} A day after the Mexico Congress Vartanyan announced publicly that the nature of Soviet system was such that this could not possibly happen.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}} As [[Robert van Voren]] wrote, the Armenian Vartanyan was as slick as one could be, and had no problem lying in the twinkling of an eye.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=61|ps=}} He was masterful in his dealings with the WPA and continued to represent the Soviet Union at symposiums and congresses of the WPA.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=61|ps=}} Being in grain hospitable, flamboyant, full of humor and with a Western style, Vartanyan managed to fool one after another.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=61|ps=}} In the end, no action was taken by the Congress.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=103|ps=}} As ''[[Psychiatric News]]'' reported, it became apparent that the WPA leaders had no desire to take an action which would have alienated the USSR delegation and would quite probably make them "walk out" and sever communications for some time to come.{{sfn|Spector|Kitsuse|2001|p=103|ps=}}

== Bukovsky and Gluzman in prison ==
The failure to debate the issue opened the door for Soviet authorities to adjudge Bukovsky to 12 years of camp and exile, and to enlarge the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=497|ps=}} In January 1972, Bukovsky was convicted of spreading anti-Soviet propaganda under Article 70 of the [[RSFSR]] [[Criminal Code]], mainly on the ground that he had, with anti-Soviet intention, circulated false reports that mentally healthy political dissenters were incarcerated in mental hospitals and were subjected to abuse there.{{sfn|Berman|Spindler|1972|p=11|ps=}}
[[File:Gluzman S.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Semyon Gluzman]] (b. 1946), a Ukrainian psychiatrist, [[human rights activist]] and [[political prisoner]]]]

However, in 1973, the council of the Royal College of Psychiatrists passed the following resolution:
{{quote|The Royal College of Psychiatrists firmly opposes the use of psychiatric facilities for the detention of persons solely on the basis of their political dissent no matter where it occurs.{{sfn|BMJ|1973|ps=}}}}

In the same year, the Representative Body of the [[British Medical Association]] at its annual meeting at [[Folkestone]] passed the following motion:
{{quote|The British Medical Association condemns the practice of using medical men to certify political and religious dissenters as insane and to submit them to unnecessary investigation and treatment.{{sfn|BMJ|1973|ps=}}}}

In 1973, [[Ruben Nadzharov]], the Deputy Director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], stated that talk in the West of the forced commitment of certain dissident representatives of the intelligentsia to psychiatric hospitals was "a component part of the anti-Soviet propaganda campaign that certain circles are trying to stir up in pursuit of highly improper political aims."{{sfn|AAASS|1973|p=5|ps=}}

In 1974, Bukovsky and the incarcerated psychiatrist [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote ''A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents'',<ref>{{harvnb|Bukovskiĭ|Gluzman|1976}}; {{harvnb|Bukovsky|Gluzman|1975}}</ref> in which they provided potential future victims of political psychiatry with instructions on how to behave during inquest in order to avoid being diagnosed as mentally sick.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496|ps=}} The Manual focuses on how "the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of [[heterodoxy]] (in one sense of the world) as a psychiatric problem."{{sfn|New Scientist|1976|ps=}} Semyon Gluzman, a first psychiatrist in the Soviet Union who openly opposed Soviet abuse of psychiatry against dissenters,{{sfn|Landau|1980|ps=}} was the author of the document ''An In Absentia Psychiatric Opinion on the Case of P.G. Grigorenko''<ref>{{harvnb|Gluzman|2010b}}; {{harvnb|De Boer|Driessen|Verhaar|1982|p=180}}; {{harvnb|Schroeter|1979|p=324}}</ref> otherwise known as ''An In Absentia Forensic-psychiatric Report on P.G. Grigorenko''; this document started circulating in [[samizdat]] form in 1971<ref>{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Psychiatric Bulletin|1981}}</ref> and was based on the medical record of Grigorenko{{sfn|Schroeter|1979|p=324|ps=}} who spoke against the human rights abuses in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Sabshin|2008|p=95|ps=}} Gluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=73|ps=}} In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camps and three years in Siberian exile for refusing to diagnose Grigorenko as having the mental illness.{{sfn|Sabshin|2008|p=95|ps=}}

In December 1976, in his eleventh year of psychiatric hospitals and prison camps, Bukovsky was exchanged by the Soviet government for the imprisoned Chilean Communist leader [[Luis Corvalán]]{{sfn|Laird|Hoffmann|1986|p=79|ps=}} at [[Zürich]] airport and, after a short stay in the [[Netherlands]], took up refuge in [[Great Britain]] where later moved from [[London]] to [[Cambridge]] for his studies in biology.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=7|ps=}} Voluntary and involuntary emigration allowed the authorities to rid themselves of many political active intellectuals including writers [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Georgi Vladimov]], [[Vladimir Voinovich]], [[Lev Kopelev]], [[Vladimir Emelyanovich Maximov|Vladimir Maximov]], [[Naum Korzhavin]], [[Vasily Aksyonov]] and others.{{sfn|Shlapentokh|1990|p=194|ps=}}

The appeal made by Bukovsky in 1971 caused the formation of the first groups to campaign against the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=150|ps=}} In [[France]], a group of doctors constituted the "[[Committee against the Special Psychiatric Hospitals in the USSR]]," while in [[Great Britain]] a "Working Commission on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals" was created.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=150|ps=}} Among its founding members were [[Peter Reddaway]], a [[Sovietologist]] and lecturer at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], and [[Sidney Bloch]], a South-African born psychiatrist.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=150|ps=}} In September 1975, there was formed the "[[Campaign Against Psychiatric Abuse]]" (CAPA),{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=328|ps=}} an organization constituted as the British section of the [[Initiating Committee Against Abuses of Psychiatry for Political Purposes]] and composed of psychiatrists, other doctors, and laymen.{{sfn|New Scientist|1976|ps=}} In July 1976 in [[Trafalgar Square]], CAPA held a rally against the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.{{sfn|New Scientist|1976|ps=}} In 1978, Royal College of Psychiatrists established the Special Committee on abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Calloway|1993|p=223|ps=}} 20 December 1980 saw the formation in [[Paris]] of the [[International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry]] (IAPUP) whose first secretary was Gérard Bles of France.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=273|ps=}}

== Honolulu Congress ==
In 1975, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] agreed to host the WPA's sixth World Congress of Psychiatry during 28 August&nbsp;– 3 September 1977, in [[Honolulu]].{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=335|ps=}} The request to discuss the Soviet issue during the World Congress of the World Psychiatric Association in Honolulu was made by Americans and the British and was supported by other societies.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=194|ps=}}

On 10 September 1976, [[Chairman of the KGB]] [[Yuri Andropov]] submitted to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] his report informing of "anti-Soviet campaign with nasty fabrications regarding the alleged use psychiatry in the USSR as an instrument in the political struggle with 'dissidents'."{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=194|ps=}} The report alleged that the campaign was a carefully planned anti-Soviet action in which a noticeable part was played by the British [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] under the influence of pro-Zionist elements and that the KGB was undertaking measures through operational channels to counter hostile attacks.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=195|ps=}} In October 1976, the [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Health]] constituted a special working group to develop a plan of action for a counter campaign.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=195|ps=}} The working group had among its members leading Soviet psychiatrists [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]], Georgi Morozov, [[Marat Vartanyan]], and [[Eduard Babayan]] under the chairmanship of [[Deputy Minister of Health]] [[Dmitri Venediktov]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=195|ps=}} The plans they worked out consisted in, inter alia, compiling documents with counterarguments for being spread before and during the World Congress; actively lobbying the media for explaining the human nature of Soviet medicine; actively lobbying inside the World Psychiatric Association for preventing the issue from being put on the agenda; lobbying the [[World Health Organization]] for exerting pressure on the WPA not to allow this unacceptable anti-Soviet campaign; and establishing closer working relations with positively inclined colleagues in the West.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=195|ps=}} In February 1977, representatives of the secret services of the USSR, the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Cuba]] met in Moscow to talk about a common approach to the issue of political abuse psychiatry and the upcoming World Congress in Honolulu.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=195|ps=}} This meeting was mainly chaired by Major General [[Ivan Pavlovich Abramov]], deputy head of the Fifth Directorate of the KGB (which dealt, inter alia, with dissenters), with the support of deputy head of the First Division of the Fifth Directorate Colonel Romanov who, according to the report, would travel with the Soviet delegation to Honolulu as "political advisor".{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=195|ps=}} The minutes of the meeting demonstrate that Western preparations for the Honolulu World Congress were under the Soviet concern in which the leading part was played by the KGB of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} Not long before the World Congress, a high-level conference was held in [[East Berlin]], and the Soviet psychiatric leaders met with colleagues from [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], the [[East Germany|GDR]], [[Hungary]], and [[Bulgaria]] to coordinate their positions.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} Much to the vexation of Georgi Morozov, the Romanians did not come to this meeting, while both the Hungarians and the Poles openly criticized the Soviet stance.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}}

However, all this activity of the Soviets could not prevent the issue from dominating the Congress from the very outset.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} At the first plenary session of the Congress, the introduction of the Declaration of Hawaii<ref>{{harvs|txt|last=WPA|year1=1977|year2=1978a|year3=1978b}}</ref> took place.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} This statement of ethical principles of psychiatry had been drafted by the Ethical Sub-Committee of the Executive Committee established in 1973 in response to the increasing number of protests against using psychiatry for non-medical reasons.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} One of the principles stated in the Declaration was that a psychiatrist must not take part in compulsory psychiatric treatment in the absence of mental disease, and the Declaration also included other clauses which could be considered as heaving a bearing on the political abuse psychiatry.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} The General Assembly accepted the Declaration of Hawaii without difficulty, and without opposition by the Delegation of the Soviets.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} However, the Declaration was later criticized by [[Hanfried Helmchen]], who found its ethical guideline No 1 to be misleading and stated that when health, personal autonomy and growth—without referring to mental illness—were formulated as the direct aim of psychiatry, the menace of vast expansion of psychiatry would increase and that the renunciation of an illness concept appeared to be an essential source for the 'total psychiatrisation of everybody and everything' which was also deplored by Blomquist in his commentary.{{sfn|Helmchen|1978|ps=}} At the plenary session, an Ethics Committee was also established under the chairmanship of [[Costas Stephanis]] from [[Greece]]; among of the members was Marat Vartanyan from the USSR.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}}

The Soviet issue passed the General Assembly less easily.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} The Soviets did all possible to prove their point, and according to the report of the Soviet delegation, Marat Vartanyan had successfully prevented former Soviet political prisoner Leonid Plyushch from being registered as a delegate at the Congress and "anti-Soviet materials" from being spread in the main congress hall.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=196|ps=}} In 1977 at the World Congress in Honolulu, Snezhnevsky again defended psychiatric practices used in his country.{{sfn|Reich|1983|ps=}} Two motions were put to the vote, a British one condemning the systematic political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR and an American one calling on the World Psychiatric Association to constitute a Review Committee to investigate the allegations of political abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} The British resolution passed with 90 to 88 votes{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} and only because the Poles did not come and the Russians, having been tardy in their dues payments, were not allowed to cast all votes allocated to them.{{sfn|Reich|1983|ps=}}

On 31 August 1977, the General Assembly of the World Psychiatric Association during its meeting in Honolulu for the VI World Congress of Psychiatry adopted the following resolution:
{{quote|That the WPA take note of the Abuse of Psychiatry for political purposes and that it condemn those practices in all countries where they occur and call upon the professional organisations of psychiatrists in those countries to renounce and expunge those practices from their country and that the WPA implement this resolution in the first instance in reference to the extensive evidence of the systematic abuse of Psychiatry for political purposes in the USSR.{{sfn|Merskey|1978|ps=}}}}

This resolution of the WPA is unprecedented in that it was the first time that an international professional association specifically condemned a great power.{{sfn|Merskey|1978|ps=}} This resolution was the climax of a lengthy campaign in the West to expose the Soviet practice of committing some of its political and other dissenters to mental hospitals.{{sfn|New Scientist|1977|ps=}} The allegations, confirmed by some Soviet psychiatrists who had fled or emigrated to the West, induced the World Psychiatric Association to condemn the USSR for the "systematic abuse of psychiatry for political purposes."{{sfn|Burns|1981|ps=}} Kremlin spokesmen ignored the action as a provocation "by a handful of antipsychiatric and antisocial elements" and began a propaganda campaign to contradict the accusations.{{sfn|Burns|1981|ps=}} The American resolution requesting to set up a Review Committee received a larger majority of votes, 121 votes against 66.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} Snezhnevsky returned to Moscow wounded, with members of his delegation putting the blame for their defeat on the "[[Zionists]]."{{sfn|Reich|1983|ps=}}

1978 saw a public statement made by Soviet psychiatrist [[Yuri Novikov (psychiatrist)|Yuri Novikov]], who was the head of a section of the Serbsky Institute for six years and first secretary of the Association of Soviet Psychiatrists until he left the Soviet Union in June 1977.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=76|ps=}} In his statement, he said that political abuses of psychiatry took place in the Soviet Union and that it was not the scale of this that mattered, but the fact that it existed.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=76|ps=}}

== UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness ==
Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union catalyzed a more general investigation into international psychiatric practices by the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]]. In 1977, the Commission created a “Sub-Commission to study, with a view to formulating guidelines, if possible, the question of the protection of those detained on the grounds of mental ill-health against treatment that might adversely affect the human personality and its physical and intellectual integrity.” The Sub-Commission subsequently appointed its two Special Rapporteurs the primary task to “determine whether adequate grounds existed for detaining persons on the grounds of mental ill-health.”{{sfn|Gosden|2001|p=23|ps=}}

The UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care was published more than a decade later. The final version of the Principles had been so repeatedly massaged and rewritten by numerous committees dominated by psychiatrists that cross-referencing and other priorities extensively buried the primary tasks of attending to the risks of treatment and involuntary detention. In 1991, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the final document. It is principally designed to protect the rights of voluntary patients, not involuntary patients. The problems of involuntary patients are addressed by the document in a way that tends to undermine their rights rather than protect them.{{sfn|Gosden|2001|p=23|ps=}}

== Review Committee ==
In August 1978, Americans donated $50,000 for the establishment of the Review Committee and, by doing so, showed their commitment to the project.{{sfn|Bloch|1980}} The President Jules Masserman, when submitting the donation, asked that the Review Committee be established without delay "for the sake of many political dissidents  at risk."{{sfn|Bloch|1980}} In December 1978, the Review Committee was set up under the chairmanship of Canadian psychiatrist [[Jean-Yves Gosselin]]{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} and, in August 1979, received the first complaints submitted by the British Royal College of Psychiatrists.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=199|ps=}} From the very first day, the Soviets refused to recognize its existence.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} Originally they attempted to prevent its establishment, maintaining that it would divert the WPA from its major function, namely the exchange of scientific ideas.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} When the Review Committee was constituted, the Soviet society asserted overtly that they would not collaborate with the Review Committee, and they confirmed their stance in three letters, in which they claimed that the Review Committee was an "illegal formation," that they would continue not to acknowledge its existence and that no cooperation could be expected.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} That stance would remain unaltered over the years to come.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}} Finally, the Review Committee was largely made powerless when the President and General Secretary of the WPA decided to bypass it and began to communicate with the Soviets directly.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=197|ps=}}

However, later, at the General Assembly during the World Congress in Vienna in 1983, the status and work of the Review Committee were discussed and it was resolved to allow the Committee to become statutory.{{sfn|Kastrup|2002|ps=}} The General Assembly resolved further to change the Committee scope towards complaints about not only political but any abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Kastrup|2002|ps=}} As it was emphasized, the WPA is not a human rights organization and the Review Committee should only examine complaints about specific acts of abuse carried out by specific psychiatrists against specific persons.{{sfn|Kastrup|2002|ps=}} The 1999 General Assembly modified the mandate of the Review Committee as follows: "The Review Committee shall review complaints and other issues and initiate investigations on the violations of the ethical guidelines for the practice of psychiatry as stated in the Declaration of Madrid and its additional guidelines in order to make recommendations to the Executive Committee as to any possible action."{{sfn|Kastrup|2002|ps=}}

== Working Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry For Political Purposes ==
{{main|Moscow Helsinki Group}}
[[File:Podrabinek-photo.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Alexandr Podrabinek]] (b. 1953), a Russian [[journalist]] and former Soviet [[human rights activist]] and [[political prisoner]]]]
In January 1977, Alexandr Podrabinek along with a 47 year-old self-educated worker [[Feliks Serebrov]], a 30 year-old computer programmer [[Vyacheslav Bakhmin]] and [[Irina Kuplun]] established the Working Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=148|ps=}} The Commission was formally linked to the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]]{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=148|ps=}} founded by [[Yuri Orlov]] along with ten others including [[Elena Bonner]] and [[Anatoly Shcharansky]] in 1976 to monitor Soviet compliance with the human rights provisions of the [[Helsinki Accords]].{{sfn|Americas Watch Committee|1984|p=67|ps=}} The commission was composed of five open members and several anonymous ones, including a few psychiatrists who, at great danger to themselves, conducted their own independent examinations of cases of alleged psychiatric abuse.{{sfn|New Scientist|1978|ps=}} The leader of the commission was [[Alexandr Podrabinek]] who published a book ''Punitive Medicine''{{sfn|New Scientist|1978|ps=}} containing a "white list" of two hundred of [[prisoners of conscience]] in Soviet mental hospitals and a "black list" of over one hundred medical staff and doctors who took part in committing people to psychiatric facilities for political reasons.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=15|ps=}}

The psychiatric consultants to the Commission were [[Alexander Voloshanovich]] and [[Anatoly Koryagin]].{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=153|ps=}} The task stated by the Commission was not primarily to diagnose persons or to declare people who sought help mentally ill or mentally healthy.<ref name="Van Voren 1989 26">{{harvnb|Voren|Bloch|1989|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=150}}</ref> However, in some instances individuals who came for help to the Commission were examined by a psychiatrist who provided help to the Commission and made a precise diagnosis of their mental condition.<ref name="Van Voren 1989 26"/> At first it was psychiatrist Alexander Voloshanovich from the Moscow suburb of [[Dolgoprudny]], who made these diagnoses.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=150|ps=}} But when he had been compelled to emigrate on 7 February 1980,{{sfn|Psychiatric Bulletin|1980|ps=}} his work was continued by the [[Kharkov]] psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=150|ps=}} Koryagin's contribution was to examine former and potential victims of political abuse of psychiatry by writing psychiatric diagnoses in which he deduced that the individual was not suffering from any mental disease.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=179|ps=}} Those reports were employed as a means of defense: if the individual was picked up again and committed to mental hospital, the Commission had vindication that the hospitalization served non-medical purposes.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=179|ps=}} Also some foreign psychiatrists including the Swedish psychiatrist [[Harald Blomberg]] and British psychiatrist [[Gery Low-Beer]] helped in examining former or potential victims of psychiatric abuse.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=150|ps=}} The Commission used those reports in its work and publicly referred to them when it was essential.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=150|ps=}}

The commission gathered as much information as possible of victims of psychiatric terror in the Soviet Union and published this information in their ''Information Bulletins''.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=45|ps=}} For the four years of its existence, the Commission published more than 1,500 pages of documentation including 22 ''Information Bulletins'' in which over 400 cases of the political abuse of psychiatry were documented in great detail.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=148|ps=}} Summaries of the ''Information Bulletins'' were published in the key samizdat publication, the ''[[Chronicle of Current Events (samizdat)|Chronicle of Current Events]]''.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=148|ps=}} The ''Information Bulletins'' were sent to the Soviet officials, with request to verify the data and notify the Commission if mistakes were found, and to the West, where human rights defenders used them in the course of their campaigns.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=148|ps=}} The ''Information Bulletins'' were also used to provide the dissident movement with information about Western protests against the political abuse.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=148|ps=}} [[Peter Reddaway]] said that after he had studied official documents in the Soviet archives, including minutes from meetings of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], it became evident to him that Soviet officials at high levels paid close attention to foreign responses to these cases, and if someone was discharged, all dissidents felt the pressure had played a significant part and the more foreign pressure the better.{{sfn|Moran|2010|ps=}} Over fifty victims examined by psychiatrists of the Moscow Working Commission between 1977 and 1981 and the files smuggled to the West by [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] in 1971 were the material which convinced most psychiatric associations that there was distinctly something wrong in the USSR.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=245|ps=}}

The Soviet authorities responded aggressively.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=45|ps=}} Members of the group were being threatened, followed, subjected to house searches and interrogations.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=45|ps=}} In the end, the members of the Commission were subjected to various terms and types of punishments: Alexander Podrabinek was sentenced to 5 years' internal exile, Irina Grivnina to 5 years' internal exile, Vyacheslav Bakhmin to 3 years in a labor camp, [[Leonard Ternovsky]] to 3 years' labor camp, Anatoly Koryagin to 8 years' imprisonment and labor camp and 4 years' internal exile, Alexander Voloshanovich was sent to voluntary exile.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=153|ps=}}

In the autumn of 1978, the British [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] carried a resolution in which it reiterated its concern over the abuse of psychiatry for the suppression of dissent in the USSR and applauded the Soviet citizens, who had taken an open stance against such abuse, by expressing its admiration and support especially for Semyon Gluzman, Alexander Podrabinek, Alexander Voloshanovich, and [[Vladimir Moskalkov]].{{sfn|Psychiatric Bulletin|1979|ps=}}

== Resolutions for expulsion or suspension ==
On 12 August 1982, in preparation for the World Congress in [[Vienna]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]] sent out to all member societies of the World Psychiatric Association a memorandum announcing their intention to organize a forum for discussing the issue of Soviet psychiatric abuse prior to the General Assembly in Vienna.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=201|ps=}} On 18 January 1983, the Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), [[Gorald Gorinovich]], delivered a message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the [[Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Central Committee]] of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] in which it said that the abnormal situation which had developed within the World Psychiatric Association put in effect its whole activity in question and that for this reason, All-Union Society took the decision to withdraw from the WPA.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=203|ps=}} On 22 January 1983, the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' published a letter by [[Allan Wynn]], the chairman of the [[Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals]], reporting that in consequence of the continued abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union the American, British, French, Danish, Norwegian, Swiss, and Australasian member societies of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] with the support indicated by many of its other members proposed resolutions for the expulsion or suspension of membership of the Soviet Society of Neurologists and Psychiatrists, which would be considered at the World Congress of the World Psychiatric Association in [[Vienna]] in July 1983.{{sfn|Wynn|1983|ps=}} On 31 January 1983, the All-Union Society officially resigned from the World Psychiatric Association{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=203|ps=}} under threat of expulsion.{{sfn|Psychiatric News|2010|ps=}} In their letter of resignation, the Soviets complained about a "slanderous campaign, blatantly political in nature... directed against Soviet psychiatry in the spirit of the '[[cold war]]' against the Soviet Union" and, being especially angry about the memorandum of the American Psychiatric Association of August 1982, charged the WPA leadership with complicity by not having spoken out against this mailing.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=204|ps=}}

According reports on hearing before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] on 20 September 1983, the national associations justly held the opinion that 10 years of mild public protests, quiet diplomacy, and private conversations with Soviet official psychiatrists had produced no significant change in the level of Soviet abuses, and that this approach had, thereby, failed.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=44|ps=}} In January 1983, the number of member associations of the World Psychiatry Association, voting for the suspension or expulsion of the Soviet Union, rose to nine.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=44|ps=}} Inasmuch as these associations would have half the votes in the WPA governing body, the Soviets was now, in January, almost sure to be voted out in July.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=45|ps=}}

According the statement made by the chairman of the APA Committee on International Abuse of Psychiatry and Psychiatrists [[Harold Vysotsky]] at the hearing, the Committee on behalf of certain persons had written hundreds of letters to the USSR, including those to authorities of the Soviet Government, to patients themselves, the families of patients, the psychiatrists who were treating these patients, but only indirectly heard from the families of patients and had never received a response from the authorities.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=16|ps=}} In the statement, he mentioned that 20 cases were referred over to the World Psychiatric Association for further investigation by their committee to review alleged abuses of psychiatry for political purposes and a number of these cases were sent to the All Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists of the USSR for clarification and response, but when months and months went by and the World Psychiatric Association had received no response from Soviet colleagues, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and a number of other psychiatric associations across the world carried a resolution which stated:<ref>{{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=185}}; {{harvnb|HRIR|1982|p=381}}</ref>

== Vienna Congress ==
The Seventh World Congress of the WPA was scheduled to meet on 10&nbsp;– 16 July 1983, at [[Vienna]] where heated discussion and a close vote on the resolutions were anticipated.{{sfn|Khronika Press|1982|p=62|ps=}} The General Assembly of the World Psychiatric Association in Vienna was likely one of the most tense and disorganized meetings in its existence.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=211|ps=}} Some delegates, especially those from [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Egypt]], [[Cuba]], and the GDR angrily appealed to the WPA Executive Committee not to accept the resignation of the Soviets, whereas others voiced the view that it was a fact of life one had to live with, an opinion supported by the WPA President [[Pierre Pichot]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=211|ps=}} The debate was preceded by a discussion of various resolutions which had been submitted, but the state of affairs was so perplexing that some delegates did not even know which resolution they were asked to vote upon.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=211|ps=}} Finally a resolution drafted by the British delegate [[Kenneth Rawnsley]],{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=211|ps=}} who served as the fourth president of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] from 1981 to 1984,{{sfn|Roth|1992|ps=}} was carried by 174 votes to 18, with 27 abstentions.<ref>{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=211|ps=}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1984|p=218}}</ref> The resolution was strikingly conciliatory in tone:<ref>{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1984|p=218}}</ref>

The freedoms of the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] period diminished the human rights movement because many of their decades-long concerns such as suppression of free expression, imprisonment of dissidents, and psychiatric abuse were no longer the main problems facing Soviet society.{{sfn|Johnston|2005|p=9|ps=}} 1986 saw the discharge of nineteen political prisoners from mental hospitals.<ref name="Fitzpatrick 1988 3">{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=318}}; {{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1988|p=3}}</ref> In 1987, sixty-four political prisoners were discharged from mental hospitals.<ref name="Fitzpatrick 1988 3"/> In early 1988, [[Chief Psychiatrist]] [[Aleksandr Churkin]] stated in an interview with ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' issued on 5 April 1988 that 5.5 million Soviet citizens were on the psychiatric register and that within two years 30% would be removed from this list.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=322|ps=}} However, a year later the journal ''[[Ogoniok]]'' published a figure of 10.2 million provided by the state statistics committee.<ref>{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=322|ps=}}; {{harvnb|Ogoniok|1989|p=24}}</ref> In 1990, ''[[Zhurnal Nevropatologii i Psikhiatrii Imeni S S Korsakova]]'' published almost the same figure of 10 million people registered at psychoneurological dispensaries and 335,200 hospital beds used in the Soviet Union by 1987.<ref>{{harvnb|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}; {{harvnb|Zharikov|Kiselev|1990|pp=70–74}}</ref> At a press conference held in Moscow on 27 October 1989, [[Gennady Milyokhin]] claimed that of the three hundred patients named by international human rights organizations, "practically all had left hospital."{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}}

== Visit of the US delegation ==
In 1989, the stonewalling of Soviet psychiatry was overcome by [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] (meaning "policy of transparency" in High Russian).<ref>{{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-Webster|2013}}</ref> Over the objection of the psychiatric establishment, the [[Soviet government]] permitted a delegation of psychiatrists from the USA, representing the [[United States government]], to carry out extensive interviews of suspected victims of abuse.{{sfn|Bonnie|2002|ps=}} They traveled to the Soviet Union on 25 February 1989.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=373|ps=}} The group consisted of about 25 people among whom were [[Bill Farrand]] of the [[State Department]]; [[Loren Roth]] as head of the psychiatric team; psychiatrists of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], including Scientific Director of the US Delegation [[Darrel A.

The delegation was able systematically to interview and assess present and past involuntarily admitted mental patients chosen by the visiting team, as well as to talk over procedures and methods of treatment with some of the patients, their friends, relatives and, sometimes, their treating psychiatrists.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=69|ps=}} Whereas the delegation originally sought interviews with 48 persons, it eventually saw 15 hospitalized and 12 discharged patients.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=69|ps=}} About half of the hospitalized patients were released in the two months between the submission of the initial list of names to the Soviets authorities and the departure from the Soviet Union of the US delegation.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=69|ps=}} The delegation came to the conclusion that nine of the 15 hospitalized patients had disorders which would be classified in the United States as serious psychoses, diagnoses corresponding broadly with those used by the Soviet psychiatrists.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=69|ps=}} One of the hospitalized patients had been diagnosed as having [[schizophrenia]] although the US team saw no evidence of mental disorder.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=70|ps=}} Among the 12 discharged patients examined, the US delegation found that nine had no evidence of any current or past mental disorder; the remaining three had comparatively slight symptoms which would not usually warrant involuntary commitment in Western countries.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=70|ps=}} According to medical record, all these patients had diagnoses of [[psychopathology]] or schizophrenia.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=70|ps=}}

When returned home after a visit of more than two weeks, the delegation wrote its report which was pretty damaging to the Soviet authorities.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=125|ps=}} The delegation established not only that there had taken place systematic political abuse of psychiatry but also that the abuse had not come to an end, that victims of the abuse still remained in mental hospitals, and that the Soviet authorities and particularly the Soviet Society of Psychiatrists and Neuropathologists still denied that psychiatry had been employed as a method of repression.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=125|ps=}} The report was published in ''[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]]'', Supplement to Vol. 15, No. 4, 1989.<ref>{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=385}}; {{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=69}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation: Report|1989}}</ref> As far as Robert van Voren could establish, the report was never published in the USSR.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=385|ps=}} Only after twenty years, in 2009, the report was traslated into Russian, and its Russian version was published not in Russia but in [[Netherlands]], on the website of the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]].{{sfn|US Delegation: Report (Russian translation)|2009|ps=}}

== Athens Congress ==
In the months prior to the Eighth World Psychiatric Assembly in [[Athens]], there was substantial dispute about the possible readmittance of the All-Union Society to the WPA.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=71|ps=}} The Eighth World Congress of the World Psychiatric Association was held between 12 and 19 October 1989 in [[Athens]].{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}} The Congress was reminiscent of the previous World Congress in 1983 in [[Vienna]], and the one before that in 1977 in [[Honolulu]].{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}} The issue of the Soviet political abuse of psychiatry raised its ugly head, and dominated the WPA proceedings.{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}}

On 16 October, the Soviet delegation convened a press conference.{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}} The panel was uniformly evasive and defensive.{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}} After a detailed and lengthy account by Karpov of Soviet psychiatric reforms in which he emphasized the specialities of the new mental health legislation and in particular the legal safeguards for patients, other panellists worked out on what they considered as positive aspects of the new developments.{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}} However then, abruptly, this sense of optimism was disrupted by the bluntest of questions posed by [[Anatoly Koryagin]]: Had political psychiatric abuse occurred or not?{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}} [[Alexander Tiganov]], who played a prominent part in the press conference, answered hesitatingly that "such cases" could have taken place during the period of stagnation "but there was a need to distinguish between psychiatric, legal and political aspects."{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}} Koryagin persevered with his challenge and countered that these answers failed to clarify whether an acknowledgment was being made that Soviet psychiatry had been misused for political reasons.{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}}

Koryagin stated that the readmission would offer carte blanche to the KGB to continue its repressive practices, that there would be further abuse of psychiatry, and that the plight of prisoners would be hopeless.{{sfn|Appleby|1987|ps=}} He proposed the four conditions for the readmission:{{sfn|Appleby|1987|ps=}}
# Soviet psychiatrists must acknowledge previous political abuses and reject them;
# all detainees must be released;
# participation in monitoring of future practice must be obligatory;
# and representatives of the World Psychiatric Association must be permitted to function freely on Soviet territory.

Several national associations, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the [[Australasian College]], the [[Swiss Psychiatric Association]], and the [[West German Psychiatric Association]] insisted that the Soviet Society should not be admitted until specific conditions had been satisfied; these included the release of all dissidents unjustifiably detained in psychiatric hospitals, and the dissociation by the authorities from the past abuse and their obligation to prevent its repetition.{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}}

The Soviet delegation to the 1989 World Congress of the WPA in Athens eventually agreed to admit that the systematic abuse of psychiatry for political purposes had indeed taken place in their country.<ref>{{harvs|txt|last=Munro|year1=2000|year2=2002|loc2=p. 32}}</ref>  At the Congress, the Soviet Society's International Secretary [[Pyotr Morozov]] on behalf of his delegation made a statement containing the following five points, which are quoted in full:{{sfn|Bloch|1990|ps=}}
{{quote|
# The All-Union Society of Psychiatrists and Narcologists publicly acknowledges that previous political conditions created an environment in which psychiatric abuse occurred for non-medical, including political, reasons.
# Victims of abuse shall have their cases reviewed within the USSR and also in cooperation with the WPA, and the registry shall not be used against psychiatric patients.
# The All-Union Society unconditionally accepts the WPA review instrument.
# The All-Union Society supports the changes in the Soviet law with full implementation relevant to the practice of psychiatry and the treatment and protection of the rights of the mentally ill.
# The All-Union Society encourages an enlightened leadership in the psychiatric professional community.
}}
[[Felice Lieh Mak]], just chosen as President-Elect, proposed a resolution which included the statement read by Morozov, and then adding that within one year the Review Committee should visit the Soviet Union and that if evidence of continued political abuse of psychiatry were to be found, a special meeting of the General Assembly should be convoked to give consideration to suspension of membership of the Soviets.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=435|ps=}} In the end, 291 votes were cast for the resolution, 45 against, with 19 abstentions.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=436|ps=}} The Soviets were readmitted to the WPA under conditions{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=436|ps=}} and on the ground of having made a public confession of the existence of previous psychiatric abuse and having given a commitment to review any present or subsequent cases and to sustain and introduce reforms to the psychiatric system and new mental health legislation.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=71|ps=}}

Deeply shocked, Anatoly Koryagin, who had considered the statement by the Soviets as completely hypocritical and insincere and had not thought that the Soviets would be permitted to return, officially renounced his Honorary Membership of the WPA by submitting on 8 November 1989 to the WPA General Secretary a short letter:{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=437|ps=}}

{{quote|No, that is wrong information, which you received from somewhere. There were no conditions. We set the conditions. That is, we proposed... eh... the Executive Committee of the WPA to come to us on an official visit to the Soviet Union within a year.}}
The next day, the government newspaper ''[[Izvestiya]]'' carried a report on 19 October which did not mention any of the conditions while asserting that the All Union Society had been granted full membership.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=437|ps=}} The dissemination of disinformation on the part of the Soviets had distinctly not yet come to an end.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=437|ps=}} Only on 27 October 1989, ''Meditsinskaya Gazeta'' reported the conditions set by the WPA General Assembly.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=437|ps=}}

== Establishing the IPA ==
[[File:Savenko Yuriy Sergeevich.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yuri Savenko]], the President of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] and editor-in-chief of ''[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]'']]
In 1989, the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] (IPA) was created as an association publicly opposing itself to official Soviet psychiatry and its offspring, the [[All-Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists]], which was completely under the control of the Soviet government and implemented its political principles.{{sfn|Neprikosnovennyj zapas|2001|ps=}} From the very beginning, the IPA and its President [[Yuri Savenko]] had to take on human rights functions in addition to educational ones: first, it was necessary to uncover the ideological basis on which the Soviet psychiatry carried out its punitive activities; second, it was necessary to develop legal norms which would forever prevent such abuses; third, it was necessary to show that it is not society that needs to be protected from the mentally ill, but the ill need to be protected from society as a whole, not only from the authorities; fourth, it was necessary to overcome rigidity and inhumane nature of modern domestic psychiatry detached from its old roots and, at the same time, artificially isolated from Western humanistic trends.{{sfn|Neprikosnovennyj zapas|2001|ps=}}

In Russia, the IPA is the sole non-governmental professional organization that makes non-forensic psychiatric expert examination at the request of citizens whose rights have been violated with the use of psychiatry.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a|ps=}}

== Visit of the WPA delegation ==
The WPA team spent three weeks in the Soviet Union,{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=71|ps=}} from 9 to 29 June 1991,{{sfn|WPA|1991|ps=}}and saw ten cases, all of which had been diagnosed by Soviet psychiatrists as having schizophrenia.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=72|ps=}} When reviewed case notes and the results of their own interviews, the WPA team confirmed the diagnosis of schizophrenia only in one case and reported that there was still a wide gap between Soviet criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia and those used internationally in other countries.<ref>{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=72}}; {{harvnb|WPA|1991|p=11}}</ref> Of the six individuals committed to a Special Psychiatric Hospital, four of the cases were distinctly of a political nature and of these four, three had never been mentally sick.<ref>{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=454}}; {{harvnb|WPA|1991|p=10}}</ref>

In a letter sent in 1991 to Aleksandr Tiganov, the new chairman of the All Union Society (or, the now called themselves, the Federation of Societies of Psychiatrists and Narcologists of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]), the WPA General Secretary [[Juan José Lopez Ibor]] wrote that the All Union Society made in the General Assembly a Statement that included five items, several of which was not yet fulfilled, and that thereby, the Executive Committee unanimously agreed that it would not recommend continuing membership of the society in June 1993. Less than two months after the visit of the team to the Soviet Union, a coup against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was carried out. The coup failed and was followed by the dissolution of the USSR. As a consequence, the All Union Society remained without a country to represent. The USSR Federation of Psychiatrists and Narcologists officially resigned from the World Psychiatric Association in October 1992.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=455|ps=}}

== Russian Mental Health Law ==
{{main|Russian Mental Health Law}}
In Russia, the enactment of its Mental Health Law took place under dramatic circumstances despite the need for the Law because of an 80 year delay, after which the Law passed by Russia as against all developed countries, and despite dimensions of political abuse of psychiatry which were unprecedented in history and were being persistently denied for two decades from 1968 to 1988. When Soviet rule was coming to an end, the decision to develop the Mental Health Law was taken from above and under the threat of economic sanctions from the [[United States]]. At a meeting held by the Health Committee of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in the autumn of 1991, the Law was approved, particularly in the speeches by the four members of the WPA commission, but this event was followed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1992, a new commission was created under the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation]] and used a new concept of developing the Law; a quarter of the commission members were the representatives of the IPA. The Law has been put in force since 1 January 1993. Adoption of the Law ''On Psychiatric Care and Guarantees of Citizens’ Rights during Its Provision'' is regarded as an epoch-making event in the history of domestic psychiatry, as establishing the legal basis for psychiatric care, and, first of all, mediating all involuntary measures through judicial procedure. That is a major post-Soviet achievement of Russian psychiatry and the foundation for a basically new attitude to the mentally ill as persons reserving all their civil and political rights and freedoms. In 1993, when the IPA printed the Law in 50 thousand copies for the general reader, quite a number of heads of the Moscow psychoneurologic dispensaries refused to circulate the Law. Over time, these difficulties were overcome. It became obligatory to know the Law to pass the certification exam.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a|pp=9–10|ps=}}

However, article 38, which was once included in the Law as a guarantee of keeping the whole Law for patients of psychiatric hospitals, is still not working, and, as a result, the service independent of health authorities to defend rights of patients in psychiatric hospitals is still not created.{{sfn|NPZ|2009|pp=85–86|ps=}}

In 2004, proponents of mental health reform could hardly prevent the effort by the doctors of the Serbsky Institute for Social and Forensic Psychiatry to roll back some reforms in Russia's landmark 1992 law on mental health.{{sfn|Murphy|2006|ps=}} Over five years, from 1998 to 2003, the [[Serbsky Center]] made three attempts to submit for the [[Duma]] readings of amendments and additions to the Law, but the IPA and general public managed to successfully challenge these amendments, and they were finally tabled.<ref>{{harvnb|Savenko|2007b|pp=75–77}}; {{harvnb|Vinogradova|Savenko|2006}}</ref>
