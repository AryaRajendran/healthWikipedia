'''Organ donation''' is the [[donation]] of [[tissue (biology)|biological tissue]] or an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] of the [[human body]], from a living or dead person to a living recipient in need of a [[organ transplantation|transplantation]]. [[Transplantable organs and tissues]] are removed in a [[surgery|surgical procedure]] following a determination, based on the donor's medical and social history, of which are suitable for transplantation. Such procedures are termed [[allotransplantation]]s, to distinguish them from [[xenotransplantation]], the transfer of animal organs into human bodies.

==Legislation==
The laws of different countries allow potential donors to permit or refuse donation, or give this choice to relatives. The frequency of donations varies among countries.

===Opt-in vs. opt-out===
{{see also|Mandated choice|Nudge (book)}}

There are two main methods for determining voluntary consent: "opt in" (only those who have given explicit consent are donors) and "opt out" (anyone who has not refused is a donor). Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation.<ref name="do defaults save lives">{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Eric J.; and Goldstein, Daniel G. |url=http://webs.wofford.edu/pechwj/Do%20Defaults%20Save%20Lives.pdf |title=Do defaults save lives? |journal=Science |format=PDF |pages=1338–1339 |date= | accessdate=2012-05-19 |doi=10.1126/science.1091721 |volume=302 |issue=5649 |pmid=14631022}}</ref> For example, Germany, which uses an opt-in system, has an organ donation consent rate of 12% among its population, while Austria, a country with a very similar culture and economic development, but which uses an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%.<ref name="do defaults save lives" /><ref>{{cite news|last=THALER|first=RICHARD H.|title=Opting in vs. Opting Out|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68tvQex6c|archivedate=4 July 2012|date=September 26, 2009}}</ref>

However, because of public policies, cultural, infrastructural and other factors, this does not always translate directly into increased effective rates of donation. In terms of effective organ donations, in some systems like Australia (14.9 donors per million, 337 donors in 2011), family members are required to give consent or refusal, or may veto a potential recovery even if the donor has consented.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Some countries with an opt-out system like Spain (34 effective donors per million inhabitants) or Austria (21 donors/million) have high donor rates and some countries with opt-in systems like Germany (16 donors/million) or Greece (6 donors/million) have effective donation lower rates.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The president of the Spanish [[National Transplant Organisation]] has acknowledged Spain's legislative approach is likely not the primary reason for the country's success in increasing the donor rates, starting in the 1990s.<ref name=ReferenceA>UK [[Organ donation taskforce]] report ''[http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_090303.pdf The potential impact of an opt out system for organ donation in the UK], page 22''</ref>

===United States===
Over 100,000 Americans are on the waiting list in need of an organ. This crisis within the United States is growing rapidly because on average there are only 30,000 transplants performed each year. More than 6,000 people die each year from lack of a donor organ, an average of 19 people a day. Between the years 1988 and 2006 the number of transplants doubled, but the number of patients waiting for an organ grew six times as large. It has been estimated that the number of organs donated would double if every person with suitable organs decided to donate. In the past presumed consent was urged to try to decrease the need for organs. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1987 was adopted in several states, and allowed medical examiners to determine if organs and tissues of cadavers could be donated. By the 1980s, several states adopted different laws that allowed only certain tissues or organs to be retrieved and donated, some allowed all, and some did not allow any without consent of the family. In 2006 when the UAGA was revised, the idea of presumed consent was abandoned. In the United States today, organ donation is done only with consent of the family or donator themselves.<ref>Orentlicher, D. (January 01, 2009).

===Europe===
[[File:IntlOrgan.png|thumb|Map showing the coverage of 3 international European organ donation associations: [[Balttransplant]], [[Eurotransplant]] and [[Scandiatransplant]]]]
Within the [[European Union]], organ donation is regulated by member states. As of 2010, 24 European countries have some form of presumed consent (opt-out) system, with the most prominent and limited opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates.<ref name=huffingtonpost>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/27/new-york-to-be-first-orga_n_554234.html|title=New York To Be First Organ Donor Opt-Out State?|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2011-03-31|date=2010-04-27}}</ref> In the United Kingdom organ donation is voluntary and no consent is presumed.

[[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] (LRMC) has become one of the most active organ donor hospitals in all of Germany, which otherwise has one of the lowest organ donation participation rates in the [[Eurotransplant]] organ network. LRMC, the largest U.S. military hospital outside the United States, is one of the top hospitals for organ donation in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] state of Germany, even though it has relatively few beds compared to many German hospitals. According to the German [[organ transplantation]] organization, Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation (DSO), 34 American military service members who died at LRMC (roughly half of the total number who died there) donated a total of 142 organs between 2005 and 2010. In 2010 alone, 10 of the 12 American service members who died at LRMC were donors, donating a total of 45 organs. Of the 205 hospitals in the DSO's central region—which includes the large cities of [[Frankfurt]] and [[Mainz]]—only six had more organ donors than LRMC in 2010.<ref name=Jones2011>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Meg|title=A Soldier's Death Gives Life to Another Man|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=2011-04-24|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/germany-us-hospital-landstuhl-organ-donations|accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref>

===Japan===
{{see also|Organ transplantation in Japan}}

The rate of organ donation in Japan is significantly lower than in Western countries.<ref name=Wicks>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408769|title=Brain Death and Transplantation: The Japanese|publisher=Medscape|date=2000-04-25|accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> This is attributed to cultural reasons, some distrust of [[western medicine]], and a controversial [[Organ transplantation in Japan|organ transplantation in 1968]] that provoked a ban on cadaveric organ donation that would last thirty years.<ref name=Wicks/> Organ donation in Japan is regulated by a 1997 organ transplant law, which defines "[[brain death]]" and legalized organ procurement from brain dead donors.

===India===
Organ selling is legally banned in India. Numerous studies have documented that organ vendors have a poor quality of life (QOL) following kidney donation. Live related renal donors have a significant improvement in the QOL following renal donation using the WHO QOL BREF in a study done at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences from 2006 to 2008. The quality of life of the donor was poor when the graft was lost or the recipient died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianjurol.com/article.asp?issn=0970-1591;year=2011;volume=27;issue=1;spage=25;epage=29;aulast=Vemuru |title=Live related donors in India: Their quality of life using world health organization quality of life brief questionnaire Vemuru Reddy SK, Guleria S, Okechukwu O, Sagar R, Bhowmik D, Mahajan S |doi=10.4103/0970-1591.78411 |publisher=Indian J Urol |date= |accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>

===Sri Lanka===
Organ donation in Sri Lanka was ratified by the Human Tissue Transplantation Act No. 48 of 1987. [[Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society]], a [[non-governmental organization]] established in 1961 has provided over 60,000 corneas for [[corneal transplantation]], for patients in 57 countries. It is one of the major suppliers of human eyes to the world, with a supply of approximately 3,000 corneas per year.<ref name="associatedpr">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/01/23/sri-lanka-donates-eyes-to-world/ | title=Sri Lanka donates eyes to the world | agency=Associated Press | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=23 January 2012 | accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref>

==Bioethical issues==

===Deontological issues===
Certain groups, like the [[Romani people|Roma]] (gypsies), oppose organ donation on religious grounds, but most<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2001/05/Organ-Donation-Where-Your-Religion-Stands.aspx?p=1|work=BeliefNet|accessdate=17 December 2011|title=Organ Donation: Where Your Religion Stands}}</ref> of the world's religions support donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community. Issues surrounding [[patient autonomy]], [[living will]]s, and [[guardianship]] make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur.

From the standpoint of [[deontological ethics]], the primary issues surrounding the morality of organ donation are semantical in nature. The debate over the definitions of [[life]], [[death]], [[human]], and [[body]] is ongoing. For example, whether or not a [[brain-dead]] patient ought to be kept artificially animate in order to preserve organs for procurement is an ongoing problem in clinical [[bioethics]]. In addition, some have argued that organ donation constitutes an act of self-harm and, even when an organ is donated willingly from a human subject, represents a step toward the commodification of human life.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meilaender|first=Gilbert|title=Gifts of the Body|journal=The New Atlantis|year=2006|month=Summer|issue=13|pages=25–35|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/gifts-of-the-body}}</ref> 

Further, the use of [[cloning]] to produce organs with an identical [[genotype]] to the recipient has issues all its own. Cloning is still a controversial topic, especially considering the possibility for an entire person to be brought into being with the express purpose of being destroyed for organ procurement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} While the benefit of such a cloned organ would be a zero-percent chance{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} of [[transplant rejection]], the ethical issues involved with creating and killing a clone may outweigh these benefits. However, it may be possible in the future to use cloned stem-cells to grow a new organ without creating a new human being.

A relatively new field of transplantation has reinvigorated the debate. [[Xenotransplantation]], or the transfer of animal (usually pig) organs into human bodies, promises to eliminate many of the ethical issues, while creating many of its own.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} While [[xenotransplantation]] promises to increase the supply of organs considerably, the threat of organ [[transplant rejection]] and the risk of [[xenozoonosis]], coupled with general [[anathema]] to the idea, decreases the functionality of the technique. Some animal rights groups oppose the sacrifice of an animal for organ donation and have launched campaigns to ban them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Teleological issues===
On [[teleological]] or [[utilitarian]] grounds, the moral status of "black market organ donation" relies upon the ends, rather than the means.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In so far as those who donate organs are often impoverished{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and those who can afford black market organs are typically well-off,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} it would appear that there is an imbalance in the trade. In many cases, those in need of organs are put on waiting lists for ''legal'' organs for indeterminate lengths of time — many die while still on a waiting list.

Organ donation is fast becoming an important [[bioethics|bioethical]] issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, the fact remains that demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a [[black market]] trend often referred to as ''transplant tourism.''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice on the one hand and a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the [[organ trade]] should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not.<ref name=Zargooshi2001>{{cite journal|author=Zargooshi J|title=Quality of life of Iranian kidney "donors"|journal=Journal of Urology|volume=166|issue=5|pages=1790–9|year=2001|pmid=11586226|doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(05)65677-7|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5347(05)65677-7}}</ref> Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure.<ref name=pmid12350189>{{cite journal|author=Goyal M, Mehta RL, Schneiderman LJ, Sehgal AR|title=Economic and health consequences of selling a kidney in India|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=288|issue=13|pages=1589–93|year=2002|pmid=12350189|doi=10.1001/jama.288.13.1589|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12350189}}</ref> These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.

A consequence of the black market for organs has been a number of cases and suspected cases of [[organ theft]]<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/01/29/india.transplant/ Police hunt for doctor in kidney snatching ring], a January 2008 article from [[CNN]]</ref><ref>David Matas and David Kilgour (31 January 2007), [http://organharvestinvestigation.net An Independent Investigation into Allegations of organ Harvesting of Falun gong practitioners in china]</ref> including murder for the purposes of organ theft.<ref name=timesonline>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1136495.ece ''TimesOnline'' Organ trafficing suspected in mass murder case]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref><ref name=Kelly2009>{{cite news|author=Annie Kelly|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/06/uganda-child-sacrifice-ritual-murder|title='&#39;The Guardian'&#39; Child sacrifice and ritual murder rise as famine looms|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 September 2009|accessdate=2011-03-31|location=London}}</ref> Proponents of a legal market for organs say that the black-market nature of the current trade allows such tragedies and that regulation of the market could prevent them. Opponents say that such a market would encourage criminals by making it easier for them to claim that their stolen organs were legal.

Legalization of the organ trade carries with it its own sense of justice as well. Continuing black-market trade creates further disparity on the demand side: only the rich can afford such organs. Legalization of the international organ trade could lead to increased supply, lowering prices so that persons outside the wealthiest segments could afford such organs as well.

Exploitation arguments generally come from two main areas:
* ''Physical exploitation'' suggests that the operations in question are quite risky, and, taking place in third-world hospitals or "back-alleys," even more risky. Yet, if the operations in question can be made safe, there is little threat to the donor.
* ''Financial exploitation'' suggests that the donor (especially in the [[India]]n subcontinent and [[Africa]]) are not paid enough. Commonly, accounts from persons who have sold organs in both legal and black market circumstances put the prices at between $150 and $5,000, depending on the local laws, supply of ready donors and scope of the transplant operation.<ref name=Carney2007>{{cite news|author=Scott Carney|url=http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_prices|title=Why a Kidney (Street Value: $3,000) Sells for $85,000|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=2011-03-31|date=2007-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111200375.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Poor Pakistanis Donate Kidneys for Money|first=Sadaqat|last=Jan|accessdate=2010-05-20|date=2006-11-12}}</ref><ref name=bbc6090468>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6090468.stm|work=BBC News|title=Iran's desperate kidney traders|date=31 October 2006|accessdate=2010-05-20|first=Nima|last=Sarvestani}}</ref> In Chennai, India where one of the largest black markets for organs is known to exist, studies have placed the average sale price at little over $1,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/288/13/1589|title=Economic and Health Consequences of Selling a Kidney in India, October 2, 2002, Goyal et al. 288 (13): 1589|publisher=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2002-10-02|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> Many accounts also exist of donors being postoperatively denied their promised pay.<ref name=Carney2007>{{cite news|author=Scott Carney|url=http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_rani|title=Inside 'Kidneyville': Rani's Story|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=2011-03-31|date=2007-05-08}}</ref>

''The New Cannibalism'' is a phrase coined by anthropologist [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]] in 1998 for an article written for The [[New Internationalist]]. Her argument was that the actual exploitation is an ethical failing, a human exploitation; a perception of the poor as organ sources which may be used to extend the lives of the wealthy.<ref>[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/biotech/organswatch/pages/cannibalism.html The New Cannibalism]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

Economic drivers leading to increased donation are not limited to areas such as India and Africa, but also are emerging in the United States. Increasing funeral expenses combined with decreasing real value of investments such as homes and retirement savings which took place in the 2000s have purportedly led to an increase in citizens taking advantage of arrangements where funeral costs are reduced or eliminated.<ref>{{Citation|last=Stix|first=Gary|date=4 January 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011|title=Donate Your Brain, Save a Buck|periodical=Scientific American|publisher=Nature America|volume=304|issue=1|page=29|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=donate-your-brain-save-a-buck}}</ref>

===Brain death versus cardiac death===
Brain death may result in [[legal death]], but still with the [[heart]] beating, and with [[mechanical ventilation]] all other vital organs may be kept completely alive and functional,<ref name=DBD>[http://surgery.about.com/od/proceduresaz/ss/OrganDonation_3.htm What is Organ Donation After Brain Death (DBD)] Organ Donation. By Jennifer Heisler, RN, About.com. Updated: January 03, 2009. About.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by the Medical Review Board</ref>{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2011}} providing optimal opportunities for organ transplantation.

Most organ donation for organ transplantation is done in the setting of brain death. However, in Japan this is a fraught point, and prospective donors may designate either brain death or cardiac death – see [[organ transplantation in Japan]]. In some nations (for instance, [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]] and [[France]]) everyone is automatically an organ donor, although some jurisdictions (such as [[Singapore]], [[Poland]],or [[New Zealand]]) allow opting out of the system. Elsewhere, consent from family members or next-of-kin is required for organ donation. The non-living donor is kept on ventilator support until the organs have been surgically removed. If a brain-dead individual is not an organ donor, ventilator and drug support is discontinued and cardiac death is allowed to occur.

{{rquote|right|In order to be dead enough to bury but alive enough to be a donor, you must be irreversibly brain dead. If it's reversible, you’re no longer dead; you’re a patient. And once you start messing around with this definition, you’re on a slippery slope, and the question then becomes: How dead do you want patients to be before you start taking their organs?|David Crippen, M.D., a critical care specialist at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]]<ref name=whendead2011/>}}
In the United States, where since the 1980s the [[Uniform Determination of Death Act]] has defined death as the irreversible cessation of the function of either the brain or the heart and lungs,<ref name=whendead2011>{{cite web|url=http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2011spring/article5.html|title=When Are You Dead?|author=John Sanford|publisher=Stanford University School of Medicine|date=Spring 2011|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> the 21st century has seen an order-of-magnitude increase of donation following cardiac death. In 1995, only one out of 100 dead donors in the nation gave their organs following the declaration of cardiac death. That figure grew to almost 11 percent in 2008, according to the [[Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients]].<ref name=whendead2011/> That increase has provoked ethical concerns about the interpretation of "irreversible" since "patients may still be alive five or even 10 minutes after cardiac arrest because, theoretically, their hearts could be restarted, [and thus are] clearly not dead because their condition was reversible."<ref name=whendead2011/>

==Political issues==
There are also controversial issues regarding how organs are allocated to recipients. For example, some believe that livers should not be given to alcoholics in danger of reversion, while others view alcoholism as a medical condition like diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Faith in the medical system is important to the success of organ donation. Brazil switched to an opt-out system and ultimately had to withdraw it because it further alienated patients who already distrusted the country's medical system.<ref name=BMJ>{{cite web|url=http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/may/consent.doc|title=Time to move to presumed consent for organ donation|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group|work=Press Release}}</ref>

Adequate funding, strong political will to see transplant outcomes improve, and the existence of specialized training, care and facilities also increase donation rates. Expansive legal definitions of death, such as Spain uses, also increase the pool of eligible donors by allowing physicians to declare a patient to be dead at an earlier stage, when the organs are still in good physical condition.

Allowing or forbidding payment for organs affects the availability of organs. Generally, where organs cannot be bought or sold, quality and safety are high, but supply is not adequate to the demand. Where organs can be purchased, the supply increases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/12/organ-sales|accessdate=12 June 2012|title=Organ sales: Paying to live | The Economist|work=[[The Economist]]|quote=Iran adopted a system of paying kidney donors in 1988 and within 11 years it became the only country in the world to clear its waiting list for transplants.|date=2011-12-07}}</ref>

Healthy humans have two kidneys, a redundancy that enables living donors (''[[inter vivos]]'') to give a kidney to someone who needs it. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system.<ref>Appel, Jacob. "Organ Solicitation on the Internet: Every Man for Himself" ''The Hastings Center Report''. Vol 35, No 3 (May–June 2005).</ref>

The [[National Transplant Organization]] of Spain is one of the most successful in the world, but it still can't meet the demand, as 10% of those needing a transplant die while still on the transplant list.<ref>[http://www.ont.es/contenido.jsp?id_nodo=181&&&keyword=&auditoria=F Organización Nacional de Trasplantes]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> Donations from corpses are anonymous, and a network for communication and transport allows fast extraction and transplant across the country.

In the overwhelming majority of cases, organ donation is not possible for reasons of recipient safety, match failures, or organ condition. Even in Spain, which has the highest organ donation rate in the world, there are only 35.1 actual donors per million people, and there are hundreds of patients on the waiting list.<ref name=BMJ/> This rate compares to 24.8 per million in Austria, where families are rarely asked to donate organs, and 22.2 per million in France, which—like Spain—has a presumed-consent system.

===Prison inmates===
In the United States, prisoners are not discriminated against as organ recipients and are equally eligible for organ transplants along with the general population. A 1976 U.S. Supreme Court case<ref>Estelle v Gamble 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.

Because donor organs are in short supply, there are more people waiting for a transplant than available organs. When a prisoner receives an organ, there is a high probability that someone else will die waiting for the next available organ. A response to this ethical dilemma states that felons who have a history of violent crime, who have violated others’ basic rights, have lost the right to receive an organ transplant, though it is noted that it would be necessary "to reform our justice system to minimize the chance of an innocent person being wrongly convicted of a violent crime and thus being denied an organ transplant"<ref>{{cite web|title=Should Violent Felons Receive Organ Transplants?|last=Perry|first=David L.|url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/submitted/Perry/transplant.html|publisher=Markkula Center for Applied Ethics|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref>

Prisons typically do not allow inmates to donate organs to anyone but immediate family members. There is no law against prisoner organ donation; however, the transplant community has discouraged use of prisoner's organs since the early 1990s due to concern over prisons' high-risk environment for infectious diseases.<ref>Guidelines for Preventing HIV Through Transplantation of Human Tissue and Organs, CDC Recommendations and Reports, May 20, 1994 /43(RR-8); 1–17.</ref> Physicians and ethicists also criticize the idea because a prisoner is not able to consent to the procedure in a free and non-coercive environment,<ref name=amednews2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2007/04/09/prsb0409.htm|title=Prisoner organ donation proposal worrisome|publisher=American Medical News|date=2007-04-09|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref> especially if given inducements to participate. However, with modern testing advances to more safely rule out infectious disease and by ensuring that there are no incentives offered to participate, some have argued that prisoners can now voluntarily consent to organ donation just as they can now consent to medical procedures in general. With careful safeguards, and with over 2 million prisoners in the U.S., they reason that prisoners can provide a solution for reducing organ shortages in the U.S.<ref>http://www.gavelife.org – Organization established to advocate for organ donations from prisoners.</ref>

==Religious viewpoints==
{{Main|Religious views on organ donation}}
{{see also|Organ donation in Jewish law}}

All major religions accept organ donation in at least some form on either utilitarian grounds (''i.e.'', because of its life-saving capabilities) or deontological grounds (''e.g.'', the right of an individual believer to make his or her own decision).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Most religions, among them the [[Roman Catholic Church]], support organ donation on the grounds that it constitutes an act of charity and provides a means of saving a life, although certain bodies, such as the [[pope]]'s, are not to be used.<ref name=vatican>{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110204/ap_on_re_eu/eu_vatican_pope_organ_donations|title=Vatican says Benedict no longer an organ donor – Yahoo! News|publisher=News.yahoo.com|date=4 February 2011|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> Some religions impose certain restrictions on the types of organs that may be donated and/or on the means by which organs may be harvested and/or transplanted.<ref>http://www.giveandletlive.co.uk/docs/ppt/RE%20PowerPoint.ppt</ref> For example, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] require that organs be drained of any blood due to their interpretation of the [[Hebrew Bible]]/Christian [[Old Testament]] as prohibiting blood transfusion,<ref name=Religions>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/donate/tissue/relgstmt.html#Jehovahs|title=American Red Cross: Statements from Religions|publisher=American Red Cross|accessdate=2008-07-22}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> and [[Muslim]]s require that the donor have provided written consent in advance.<ref name=Religions/> A few groups disfavor organ transplantation or donation; notably, these include [[Shinto]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/shintoethics/organs.shtml|title=Religion & Ethics – Organ donation|publisher=BBC|date=2009-09-16|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> and those who follow the customs of the [[Romani people|Gypsies]].<ref name=Religions/>

[[Orthodox Judaism]] considers organ donation obligatory if it will save a life, as long as the donor is considered dead as defined by Jewish law.<ref name=Religions/> In both Orthodox Judaism and non-Orthodox Judaism, the majority view holds that organ donation is permitted in the case of irreversible cardiac rhythm cessation. In some cases, rabbinic authorities believe that organ donation may be mandatory, whereas a minority opinion considers any donation of a live organ as forbidden.<ref>Sinclair 2003, p.242</ref>

==Organ shortfall==
The demand for organs significantly surpasses the number of donors everywhere in the world. There are more potential recipients on organ donation waiting lists than organ donors. In particular, due to significant advances in [[dialysis]] techniques, patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can survive longer than ever before. Because these patients don't die as quickly as they used to, and as kidney failure increases with the rising age and prevalence of high blood pressure and diabetes in a society, the need especially for kidneys rises every year.

In the United States, about 115,152 people are on the waiting list,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unos.org/|publisher=United Network for Organ Sharing|title=Organ Donation and Transplantation|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref> although about a third of those patients are inactive and could not receive a donated organ.<ref name=washingtonpost>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102981_pf.html|title=A Third of Patients On The Transplant List Are Not Eligible|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-04-30|first=Rob|last=Stein}}</ref> Wait times and success rates for organs differ significantly between organs due to demand and procedure difficulty. Three-quarters of patients in need of an organ transplant are waiting for a kidney,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctdn.org/resources_public.php#Statistics|title=Resources|publisher=California Transplant Donor Network|date=|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> and as such kidneys have much longer waiting times. At the Oregon Health and Science University, for example, the median patient who ultimately received an organ waited only three weeks for a heart and three months for a pancreas or liver — but 15 months for a kidney, because demand for kidneys substantially outstrips supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/transplant/|title=OHSU Transplant Program|publisher=Oregon Health & Science University|date=2011-03-16|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref>

In Australia, there are 10.8 transplants per million people,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donatewest.health.wa.gov.au/documents/ReflectionsWinter_2005.pdf|title=Organ & Tissue Donation Western Australia (WA)|publisher=DonateLife in Western Australia|date=|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> about a third of the Spanish rate. The [[Lions Eye Institute]], in Western Australia, houses the [[Lions Eye Bank]]. The Bank was established in 1986 and coordinates the collection, processing and distribution of eye tissue for transplantation. The Lions Eye Bank also maintains a waitlist of patients who require corneal graft operations.
About 100 corneas are provided by the Bank for transplant each year, but there is still a waiting list for corneas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lei.org.au/go/lions-eye-bank |title=Lions Eye Institute: Lions Eye Bank |publisher=Lei.org.au |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>

"To an economist, this is a basic supply-and-demand gap with tragic consequences."<ref name=Dubner2006>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/magazine/09wwln_freak.html|title=Flesh Trade|publisher=New York Times|date=2006-07-09|first1=Stephen J.|last1=Dubner|first2=Steven D.|last2=Levitt}}</ref> Approaches to addressing this shortfall include:
* donor registries and "primary consent" laws, to remove the burden of the donation decision from the legal next-of-kin. Illinois adopted a policy of "mandated choice" in 2006, which requires driver's license registrants to answer the question “Do you want to be an organ donor?” Illinois has a registration rate of 60 percent compared to 38 percent nationally.<ref name=nytimes2009>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html|title=Opting In vs. Opting Out|publisher=New York Times|date=2009-09-26|first=Richard H.|last=Thaler}}</ref> The added cost of adding a question to the registration form is minimal.
* monetary incentives for signing up to be a donor. Some economists have advocated going as far as allowing the sale of organs. The New York Times reported that “Gary Becker and Julio Jorge Elias argued in a recent paper that 'monetary incentives would increase the supply of organs for transplant sufficiently to eliminate the very large queues in organ markets, and the suffering and deaths of many of those waiting, without increasing the total cost of transplant surgery by more than 12 percent.'”<ref name="Dubner2006"/> Iran allows the sale of kidneys, and has no waiting list.<ref name=Ghods2006>{{cite journal|author=Ghods AJ, Savaj S|year=2006|title=Iranian model of paid and regulated living-unrelated kidney donation|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|volume=1|issue=6|pages=1136–45|doi=10.2215/CJN.00700206|pmid=17699338|url=}}</ref> The primary argument against this proposal is a moral one; as the article notes, many find such a suggestion repugnant.<ref name="Dubner2006"/> As the National Kidney Foundation puts it, “Offering direct or indirect economic benefits in exchange for organ donation is inconsistent with our values as a society. Any attempt to assign a monetary value to the human body, or body parts, either arbitrarily, or through market forces, diminishes human dignity.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/positionpaper03.cfm|title=Financial Incentives for Organ Donation}}</ref>
* an opt-out system ("dissent solution"), in which a potential donor or his/her relatives must take specific action to be excluded from organ donation, rather than specific action to be included. This model is used in several European countries, such as Austria, which has a registration rate eight times that of Germany, which uses an opt-in system.<ref name="nytimes2009"/>
* social incentive programs, wherein members sign a legal agreement to direct their organs first to other members who are on the transplant waiting list. One example of a private organization using this model is LifeSharers, which is free to join and whose members agree to sign a document giving preferred access to their organs.<ref>{{cite web|url=lifesharers.org|title=Lifesharers.org}}</ref> “"The proposal [for an organ mutual insurance pool] can be easily summarized: An individual would receive priority for any needed transplant if that individual agrees that his or her organs will be available to other members of the insurance pool in the event of his or her death. … The main purpose [of this proposal] is to increase the supply of transplantable organs in order to save or improve more lives."<ref name=Schwindt1998>{{cite journal|author=Richard Schwindt and Aidan Vining|title=Proposal for a Mutual Insurance Pool for Transplant Organs|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=23|issue=5|year=1998|pages=725–41|doi=|url=}}</ref>

In hospitals, organ network representatives routinely screen patient records to identify potential donors shortly in advance of their deaths.<ref name=NewZeal/> In many cases, organ-procurement representatives will request screening tests (such as [[blood typing]]) or organ-preserving drugs (such as [[Antihypertensive|blood pressure drugs]]) to keep potential donors' organs viable until their suitability for transplants can be determined and family consent (if needed) can be obtained.<ref name=NewZeal/> This practice increases transplant efficiency, as potential donors who are unsuitable due to infection or other causes are removed from consideration before their deaths, and decreases the avoidable loss of organs.<ref name=NewZeal/> It may also benefit families indirectly, as the families of unsuitable donors are not approached to discuss organ donation.<ref name=NewZeal/>

The [[Center for Ethical Solutions]], an American bioethics think tank, is currently working on a project called "Solving the Organ Shortage," in which it is studying the Iranian kidney procurement system in order to better inform the debate over solving the organ shortfall in the United States.<ref>[http://ethical-solutions.org/62/solving-the-organ-shortage.html Solving the Organ Shortage]. Center for Ethical Solutions. Retrieved on 2009-07-08.</ref>

==Distribution==
The United States has two agencies that govern organ procurement and distribution within the country. The United Network for Organ Sharing and the [[Organ Procurement and Transplant Network]] (OPTN) regulate Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) with regard to procurement and distribution ethics and standards. OPOs are non-profit organizations charged with the evaluation, procurement and allocation of organs whithin their Designated Service Area (DSA). Once a donor has been evaluated and consent obtained, provisional allocation of organs commences. UNOS developed a computer program that automatically generates donor specific match lists for suitable recipients based on the criteria that the patient was listed with. OPO coordinators enter donor information into the program and run the respective lists. Organ offers to potential recipients are made to transplant centers to make them aware of a potential organ. The surgeon will evaluate the donor information and make a provisional determination of medical suitability to their recipient. Distribution varies slightly between different organs but is essentially very similar. When lists are generated many factors are taken into consideration; these factors include: distance of transplant center from the donor hospital, blood type, medical urgency, wait time, donor size and tissue typing. For heart recipients medical urgency is denoted by a recipients "Status" (Status 1A, 1B and status 2). Lungs are allocated based on a recipients Lung Allocation Score (LAS) that is determined based on urgency and wait time. Livers are allocated using both a status system and MELD/PELD score (Model for End-stage Liver Disease/Pediatric End-stage Liver Disease). Kidney and pancreas lists are based on location, blood type, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing and wait time. When a recipient for a kidney or pancreas has no direct antibodies to the donor HLA the match is said to be a 0 ABDR mismatch or zero antigen mismatch. A zero mismatch organ has a low rate of rejection and allows a recipient to be on lower doses of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s. Since zero mismatches have such high graft survival these recipients are afforded priority regardless of location and wait time. UNOS has in place a "Payback" system to balance organs that are sent out of a DSA because of a zero mismatch.

Location of a transplant center with respect to a donor hospital is given priority due to the effects of Cold Ischemic Time (CIT). Once the organ is removed from the donor, blood no longer perfuses through the vessels and begins to starve the cells of oxygen ([[ischemia]]). Each organ tolerates different ischemic times. Hearts and lungs need to be transplanted within 4–6 hours from recovery, liver about 8–10 hours and pancreas about 15 hours; kidneys are the most resilient to ischemia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Kidneys packaged on ice can be successfully transplanted 24–36 hours after recovery. Developments in kidney preservation have yielded a device that pumps cold preservation solution through the kidneys vessels to prevent Delayed Graft Function (DGF) due to ischemia. Perfusion devices, often called kidney pumps, can extend graft survival to 36–48 hours post recovery for kidneys. Research and development is currently underway for heart and lung preservation devices, in an effort to increase distances procurement teams may travel to recover an organ.

==Suicide==
People committing [[suicide]] have a higher rate of donating organs than average. One reason is lower negative response or refusal rate by the family and relatives, but the explanation for this remains to be clarified.<ref name=fmf/> In addition, donation consent is higher than average from people committing suicide.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376356 | pmid = 19376356 | doi=10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.02.043 | volume=41 | issue=3 | title=Behavior profile of family members of donors and nondonors of organs | year=2009 | month=April | author=Moraes BN, Bacal F, Teixeira MC, ''et al.'' | journal=Transplant. Proc. | pages=799–801}}</ref>

Attempted suicide is a common cause of [[brain death]] (3.8%), mainly among young men.<ref name=fmf>{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17362725 | pmid = 17362725 | doi=10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.01.015 | volume=39 | issue=2 | title=Organ donation in suicides | year=2007 | month=March | author=Figueiredo FM, Capaverde FB, Londero GG, ''et al.'' | journal=Transplant.

Brain death may result in [[legal death]], but still with the [[heart]] beating, and with [[mechanical ventilation]] all other vital organs may be kept completely alive and functional,<ref name=DBD/> providing optimal opportunities for [[organ transplantation]].

==Controversies==
In 2008, California transplant surgeon Hootan Roozrokh was charged with [[dependent adult abuse]] for prescribing what prosecutors alleged were excessive doses of morphine and sedatives to hasten the death of a man with [[adrenoleukodystrophy|adrenal leukodystrophy]] and irreversible brain damage, in order to procure his organs for transplant.<ref name="urlSurgeon Accused of Speeding a Death to Get Organs - New York Times">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/us/27transplant.html|title=Surgeon Accused of Speeding a Death to Get Organs|author=Jesse McKinley|date=2008-02-27|work=The New York Time|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> The case brought against Roozrokh was the first criminal case against a [[transplant surgeon]] in the US, and resulted in his acquittal.

At California's Emanuel Medical Center, neurologist Narges Pazouki, MD, said an organ-procurement organization representative pressed her to declare a patient brain-dead before the appropriate tests had been done.<ref name=NewZeal>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/12/AR2007091202681.html|title=New Zeal in Organ Procurement Raises Fears|author=Rob Stein|date=2007-09-13|work=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> She refused.

In September 1999, eBay blocked an auction for "one functional human kidney" which had reached a highest bid of $5.7 million. Under United States federal laws, eBay was obligated to dismiss the auction for the selling of human organs which is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine.<ref name="Human Organs and eBay">{{cite web|url=http://www.jhhuebert.com/articles/organs.html|title=Human Organs and Ebay: A Combination That Could Save Lives|author=J.H.

On June 27, 2008, Indonesian Sulaiman Damanik, 26, pleaded guilty in a [[Singapore]] court for sale of his kidney to [[Tangs|CK Tang's]] executive chair, Mr. Tang Wee Sung, 55, for 150 million [[rupiah]] (US$17,000). The Transplant Ethics Committee must approve living donor kidney transplants. Organ trading is banned in Singapore and in many other countries to prevent the exploitation of "poor and socially disadvantaged donors who are unable to make informed choices and suffer potential medical risks." Toni, 27, the other accused, donated a kidney to an Indonesian patient in March, alleging he was the patient's adopted son, and was paid 186 million rupiah (US$21,000).

==Becoming a donor==
{{globalize|date=January 2013}}
Registering is the first step, as well as the most crucial part, of becoming an organ donor. There are a few different ways people can choose to do so. One of the simplest ways is register is at the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles). When a person goes in to renew their license they are always presented with the option of becoming a donor, which only requires ticking a box on a form and a signature. There is also a box that people can specify which organs and tissues to donate, and if they would prefer to not have them used for science.

Another way for someone to become an organ donor is online. In 1998 a law was passed that allows Colorado citizens to register, confidentially, online to become an organ donor. People can also designate whether or not they would like their organs and tissues to be donated to science. The process can be completed in only a few minutes.
