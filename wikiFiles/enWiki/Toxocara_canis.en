'''''Toxocara canis''''' (also known as [[dog]] [[roundworm]]) is worldwide-distributed [[helminth]] parasite of dogs and other [[canid]]s. ''T. canis'' is [[gonochorism|gonochoristic]], adult [[worm]]s measure from 9 to 18&nbsp;cm, are yellow-white in color, and occur in the intestine of the definitive host. In adult dogs, the infection is usually asymptomatic. By contrast, massive infection with ''T. canis'' can be fatal in puppies.<ref name = svobodova>{{cite book | author =Svobodová V, Svoboda M | title =Klinická parazitologie psa a kočky | edition =  | publisher = ČAVLMZ | year = 1995 | isbn =}}</ref><ref name = jurasek>{{cite book | author = Jurášek V, Dublinský P, et al | title = Veterinárna parazitológia | edition = | publisher =Príroda a.s. | year =1993 | isbn =80-07-00603-6}}</ref> As [[paratenic]] hosts, a number of various [[vertebrate]]s, including humans, and some [[invertebrates]] can become infected.

Owing to transmission of the infection from bitches to puppies, preventive [[anthelmintic]] treatment of newborn puppies is strongly recommended. Several antihelmintic drugs are effective against adult worms, for example [[pyrantel]], [[fenbendazole]], [[selamectine]], etc.<ref name= merck>[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/23505.htm The Merck Veterinary Manual]</ref>

== Morphology ==
The adult ''T. canis'' has a round body with spiky cranial and caudal parts, covered by yellow [[cuticula]]. The cranial part of the body contains two lateral alae (length 2–2.5&nbsp;mm, width 0.2&nbsp;mm). Male worms measure 9–13 by 0.2–0.25&nbsp;cm and female worms 10–18 by 0.25–0.3&nbsp;cm. ''T. canis'' eggs have oval or spherical shapes with granulated surfaces, are thick-walled, and measure from 72 to 85 μm.<ref name = svobodova/>

== Life cycle ==
Four modes of infection are associated with this species. The basic form is typical to all [[Ascaridida|ascaroides]], with the egg containing the L<sub>2</sub>(the second larval developmental stage) being infective, at optimal temperature and humidity, four weeks after secreted in the faeces to the environment. After ingestion and hatching in  the [[small intestine]], the L<sub>2</sub> larvae travel through the portal blood stream into the [[liver]] and [[lung]]s. Such migratory route is known as enterohepatic pulmonar larval migration. The second molt takes place in the lungs, the now L<sub>3</sub> larvae return via the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and into the intestines, where the final two molts take place. This form of infection occurs regularly only in dogs up to three months of age.

In older dogs, this type of migration occurs less frequently, and at six months it is almost ceased. Instead, the L<sub>2</sub> travel to a wide range of organs, including the liver, lungs, [[brain]], [[heart]] and [[skeletal muscle]]s, as well as to the walls of the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. In pregnant bitches, prenatal infection can occur, where larvae become mobilized (at about three weeks prior to parturition) and migrate to the lungs of the fetus, here molting into the L<sub>3</sub> stage just prior to birth. In the newborn pup, the cycle is completed when the larvae migrate through the trachea and into the [[intestinal lumen]], where the final molts take place. Once infected, a bitch will usually harbor sufficient larvae to subsequently infect all of her litters, even if she never again encounters an infection. A certain amount of the bitch's dormant larvae penetrate into the intestinal lumen, where molting into adulthood takes place again, thus leading to a new release of eggs containing L<sub>1</sub> larvae.

The suckling pup may be infected by the presence of L<sub>3</sub> larvae in the milk during the first three weeks of [[lactation]]. There is no migration in the pup via this route.
L<sub>2</sub> larvae may also be ingested by a variety of animals, where they stay in a dormant stage inside the animals' tissue until the intermediate host has been eaten by a dog, where subsequent development is confined to the gastrointestinal tract.<ref>Veterinary parasitology 2ndedition G M Urqhart, J Armour, J L Duncen, A M Dunn F W Jennings Blackwell Science publishing 1996.</ref>

==Transmission to humans==
Humans can be infected by this roundworm, a condition called [[toxocarosis]], just by stroking an infected dog's fur. In humans, this parasite usually grows in the back of the eye, which can result in blindness, or in the liver or lungs.<ref name="New Scientist - dog stroking">[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3651-dog-stroking-can-transmit-debilitating-parasite.html "Dog stroking can transmit debilitating parasite"]. ''[New Scientist]''. Andy Coghlan. Published 4-23-2003. Accessed 6-01-2012.</ref> However, a 2004 study showed, of 15 infected dogs, only seven had eggs in their [[coat (animal)|coat]]s, and no more than one egg was found on each dog. Furthermore, only 4% of those eggs were [[embryonated|infectious]].<ref name="PMID: 15382563. Negligible risk.">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15382563 "Negligible risk of visceral or ocular larva migrans from petting a dog. PMID: 15382563."]. Published 8-7-2004;148(32):1600-3. "Overgaauw PA, van Knapen F."</ref> Given the low concentration of fertile eggs on infected dogs' coats (less than 0.00186% per gram), it is plausible that such eggs were transferred to the dog's coat by contact with fecal deposites in the environment, making dog coats the [[passive]] transport [[Host_(biology)|host]]s.<ref name="PMID: 15382563. Negligible risk." /> 

The risk of being infected by petting a dog is extremely limited and, since a single infected puppy can produce more than 100,000 roundworm eggs per [[gram]] of [[feces]],<ref>[http://www.thedoctorstv.com/forums/707-November-21-2-11-Gross-Anatomy/topics/12552-Round-Worms-from-an-infected-puppy "Round Worms from an infected puppy"] "''TheDoctorsTv''". Published 3-19-2012. Accessed 6-01-2012.</ref> humans are much more likely to be infected by contact with feces than contact with fur. As such, little reason exists for humans to fear infection, as long as basic [[hygiene]], such as hand-washing, is followed.<ref name="New Scientist - dog stroking" /> 

Several treatments, all of which are cheap and easily accessible by the average dog owner, can prevent a dog from becoming infected or [[Deworming|rid]] an infected pet of its roundworm parasites.

== Treatment ==
Visceral toxocariasis in humans (or dogs) can be treated with antiparasitic drugs such as [[albendazole]] or [[mebendazole]], usually in combination with anti-inflammatory medications. Treatment of ocular toxocariasis is more difficult and usually consists of measures to prevent progressive damage to the eye.
