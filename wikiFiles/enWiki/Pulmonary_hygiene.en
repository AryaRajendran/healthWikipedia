</ref> is a set of methods used to clear [[mucus]] and [[secretion]]s from the [[airway]]s.  The word ''pulmonary'' refers to the [[lung]]s.  [[Toilet#Etymology|The word ''toilet'']] is related to the French ''toilette'', refers to body care and [[hygiene]]; this root is used in words such as ''[[toiletry]]'' that also relate to cleansing.These methods are widely used by Physiotherapists/specialist Physiotherapists who are specialising in Cardiopulmonary field.

Respiratory health (pulmonary hygiene) depends on consistent clearance of airway secretions. Normal airway clearance is accomplished by 2 important mechanisms: the mucociliary clearance system and the ability to cough. Impaired mucociliary clearance is linked to poor lung function in a broad range of diseases and disabilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Importance of Airway Clearance|url=http://www.hill-rom.com/usa/Clinical-Resources/Respiratory-Care/The-Importance-of-Airway-Clearance/}}</ref> 

Pulmonary hygiene prevents [[atelectasis]] (the collapse of the [[alveoli]] of the lungs) and rids the respiratory system of secretions,<ref name="Allen96">{{cite journal |author=Allen GS, Coates NE |title=Pulmonary contusion: A collective review |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=895–900 |year=1996 |month=November |pmid=8895709 |doi= |url=}}</ref> which could cause [[respiratory infection]]s.

== Methods ==

Methods used for pulmonary hygiene include [[suction (medicine)|suctioning]] of the airways, [[chest physiotherapy]], [[blow bottle]]s,<ref name="Allen96"/> and nasotracheal suction.<ref name="AllenCox98">{{cite journal |author=Allen GS, Cox CS |title=Pulmonary contusion in children: Diagnosis and management| journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=91 |issue=12 |pages=1099–1106 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9853720 |doi= 10.1097/00007611-199812000-00002|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0038-4348&volume=91&issue=12&spage=1099}}</ref>  [[Bronchoscopy]], in which a tube is inserted into the airways so that an examiner can view them, can be used therapeutically as part of pulmonary hygiene.<ref name="Michaels04"/> Incentive [[spirometry]] and use of [[analgesic]]s (pain medications) that do not inhibit breathing are also parts of pulmonary toilet.<ref name="Wilson01"/>  [[Coughing]] is also important for ridding the airways of secretions, so healthcare providers are careful not to [[sedation|oversedate]] patients, because that could inhibit coughing.<ref name="Goodman07">{{cite book |author=Goodman G|chapter= Chronic pulmonary disease: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia |editor=Perkin RM, Swift JD, Dale AN, Anas NG| title=Pediatric Hospital Medicine: Textbook of Inpatient Management |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages=233 |isbn=0-7817-7032-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-06-30 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=sV6-ifUGoMYC&pg=PA233&dq=%22pulmonary+toilet%22}}</ref>  [[Tracheotomy]] facilitates pulmonary toilet.<ref name="isbn0-387-98393-7">{{cite book |author=Reilley JM, Sicard GA|chapter= |editor= Rosenthal RA, Zenilman ME, Katlic MR |title=Principles and Practice of Geriatric Surgery |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2001 |pages=492 |isbn=0-387-98393-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-01 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=L3VO1gn47_0C&pg=PA254&vq=toilet&dq=%22pulmonary+toilet%22+%22pulmonary+physiotherapy%22}}</ref> Percussion, another method, loosens secretions and allows the [[cilia]] of the airways to remove material.

===Conventional Chest physiotherapy===
The most common treatment of [[atelectasis]] in the hospital setting is manual chest physiotherapy<ref name="pmid8058427">{{cite journal| author=Galvis AG, Reyes G, Nelson WB| title=Bedside management of lung collapse in children on mechanical ventilation: saline lavage--simulated cough technique proves simple, effective. | journal=Pediatr Pulmonol | year= 1994 | volume= 17 | issue= 5 | pages= 326–30 | pmid=8058427 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref> though there is limited evidence of its efficacy.<ref name="pmid16137380">{{cite journal| author=Schindler MB| title=Treatment of atelectasis: where is the evidence? | journal=Crit Care | year= 2005 | volume= 9 | issue= 4 | pages= 341–2 | pmid=16137380 | doi=10.1186/cc3766 | pmc=1269473   }}</ref><ref name="pmid11115476">{{cite journal| author=Stiller K| title=Physiotherapy in intensive care: towards an evidence-based practice. | journal=Chest | year= 2000 | volume= 118 | issue= 6 | pages= 1801–13 | pmid=11115476 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>  Chest percussion & postural drainage used in [[bronchiectasis]] and lung [[abscess]].

The treatment is often used in conjunction with a technique for loosening secretions in the chest cavity called chest percussion. Chest percussion is performed by clapping the back or chest with a cupped hand. Alternatively, a mechanical vibrator may be used in some cases to facilitate loosening of secretions.<ref>http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec04/ch040/ch040i.html</ref> There are drainage positions for all segments of the lung. These positions are modified depending on the patient's condition and the location of the area in most need of therapy.

=== Intermittent positive pressure breathing (Physiotherapy) ===
{{Main|Intermittent positive pressure breathing}}
Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB)Physiotherapy has long been used in the intensive care setting in non-intubated patients. Although widely accepted, few studies have validated its efficacy.  In a Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guideline,<ref name="pmid12778895">{{cite journal| author=Sorenson HM, Shelledy DC, AARC| title=AARC clinical practice guideline.

IPPB physiotherapy should be used with caution in patients with severe, uncontrolled bronchospasm or severe airway obstruction

==Applications==
Pulmonary bronchial hygiene is used for preventing infections such as [[pneumonia]].  It is also used in the management of conditions such as pneumonia and [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref name="Wilson01">

</ref>  For people with chronic [[lung disease]]s, bronchial hygiene  is used to prevent infections and [[lung abscess]]es.<ref name="Wilson01B">Virk and Wilson, p. 153</ref>  Bronchial hygiene is also used to prevent [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] after chest trauma.<ref name="Michaels04"/>

==Indications==
The need for bronchial hygiene is indicated in cases of [[COPD]], [[pneumonia]] and [[cystic fibrosis]] as both interventional and prophylactic.  Prophylactic indications also include pre and post thoracic surgery to prevent atelectasis and respiratory infections.

==Contraindications==
The decision to use postural drainage therapy requires assessment of potential benefits versus potential risks. Therapy should be provided for no longer than necessary to obtain the desired therapeutic results.  Some of the contraindications include an increased intracranial pressure (>20mmHg), any spinal injury acute or otherwise, active [[hemoptysis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], pulmonary edema with [[congestive heart failure]] and an open or healing wound in the area where chest physiotherapy is otherwise indicated.

Medication contraindications vary depending on the medication being delivered.
