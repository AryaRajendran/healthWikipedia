'''Hypercapnia''' or '''hypercapnea''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''hyper'' = "above" or "too much" and ''kapnos'' = "[[smoke]]"), also known as hypercarbia, is a condition where there is too much [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the blood. Carbon dioxide is a [[gas]]eous product of the [[human body|body's]] [[metabolism]] and is normally expelled through the [[lung]]s. 

Hypercapnia normally triggers a reflex which increases breathing and access to oxygen, such as arousal and turning the head during sleep. A failure of this reflex can be fatal, as in [[sudden infant death syndrome]].<ref>N Engl J Med 361:795 The sudden infant death syndrome</ref>

Hypercapnia is the opposite of [[hypocapnia]].

== Causes ==

Hypercapnia is generally caused by [[hypoventilation]], [[lung disease]], or diminished [[consciousness]]. It may also be caused by exposure to environments containing abnormally high concentrations of carbon dioxide (usually due to volcanic or geothermal causes), or by [[rebreathing]] exhaled [[carbon dioxide]]. It can also be an initial effect of administering supplemental oxygen on a patient with sleep apnea. In this situation the hypercapnia can also be accompanied by [[respiratory acidosis]].<ref>Dement, Roth, Kryger, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JpNeAAAACAAJ&dq=%27Principles+%26+Practices+of+Sleep+Medicine 'Principles & Practices of Sleep Medicine'] 3rd edition, 2000, p. 887.</ref>

== Symptoms and signs ==

Symptoms and signs of early hypercapnia include flushed skin, full [[pulse]], [[tachypnea]], [[dyspnea]], [[extrasystole]]s, muscle twitches, hand flaps, reduced neural activity, and possibly a raised [[blood pressure]]. According to other sources, symptoms of mild hypercapnia might include headache, confusion and lethargy. Hypercapnia can induce increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias.<ref>Stapczynski J. S, "Chapter 62. Respiratory Distress" (Chapter).

== Laboratory values ==

Hypercapnia is generally defined as a [[blood gas]] carbon dioxide level over 45 mmHg. Since carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] in the blood, hypercapnia can drive serum pH down, resulting in a [[respiratory acidosis]]. Clinically, the effect of hypercapnia on pH is estimated using the ratio of the arterial pressure of carbon dioxide to the concentration of bicarbonate ion, P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>/[HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>].

== During diving ==

Normal respiration in divers results in [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] [[hypoventilation]] resulting in inadequate CO<sub>2</sub> elimination or hypercapnia. Lanphier's work at the [[United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit|US Navy Experimental Diving Unit]] answered the question "why don't divers breathe enough?":<ref name=usn>{{cite book |title=US Navy Diving Manual, 6th revision |year=2006 |publisher=US Naval Sea Systems Command |location=United States |url=http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&pageID=3.9 |accessdate=2008-06-10 }}</ref>
* Higher Inspired Oxygen (PiO<sub>2</sub>) at 4 atm (404 kPa) accounted for not more than 25% of the elevation in End Tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (etCO<sub>2</sub>) above values found at the same work rate when breathing air just below the surface.<ref name=AD0784151>{{cite journal |author=Lanphier, EH |title=Nitrogen-Oxygen Mixture Physiology, Phases 1 and 2 |year=1955 |journal=US Navy Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=AD0784151 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3326 |accessdate=2008-06-10 }}</ref><ref name=AD0728247>{{cite journal |author=Lanphier EH, Lambertsen CJ, Funderburk LR |title=Nitrogen-Oxygen Mixture Physiology &ndash; Phase 3.

* Increased Work of Breathing accounted for most of the elevation of PACO<sub>2</sub> ([[alveolar gas equation]]) in exposures above 1 atm (101 kPa), as indicated by the results when helium was substituted for nitrogen at 4 atm (404 kPa).<ref name=AD0784151/><ref name=AD0728247/><ref name=AD0206734/><ref name=AD0725851/>
* Inadequate ventilatory response to exertion was indicated by the fact that, despite resting values in the normal range, PetCO<sub>2</sub> rose markedly with exertion even when the divers breathed air at a depth of only a few feet.<ref name=AD0784151/><ref name=AD0728247/><ref name=AD0206734/><ref name=AD0725851/>

=== Additional sources of carbon dioxide in diving ===

There is a variety of reasons for [[CO2 retention|carbon dioxide not being expelled completely]] when the diver exhales:
* The diver is exhaling into a vessel that does not allow all the CO<sub>2</sub> to escape to the environment, such as a long [[Snorkeling|snorkel]], [[full face diving mask]], or [[diving helmet]], and the diver then re-inhales from that vessel, causing increased [[Dead space (physiology)|deadspace]].<ref name=AD0725851/>
* The [[soda lime|carbon dioxide scrubber]] in the diver's [[rebreather]] is failing to remove sufficient carbon dioxide from the loop (Higher inspired CO<sub>2</sub>).
* The diver is over-exercising, producing excess carbon dioxide due to elevated metabolic activity.
* The [[density]] of the [[breathing gas]] is higher at depth, so the effort required to fully inhale and exhale has increased, making breathing more difficult and less efficient (Work of breathing).<ref name=usn/> The higher gas density also causes gas mixing within the lung to be less efficient, thus increasing the deadspace (wasted breathing).<ref name=AD0725851/>
* The diver is deliberately [[hypoventilation|hypoventilating]], known as "skip breathing" (''see below'').

=== Skip breathing ===

Skip breathing is a controversial technique to conserve [[breathing gas]] when using [[open-circuit scuba]], which consists of briefly holding one's breath between inhalation and exhalation (i.e., "skipping" a breath). It leads to CO<sub>2</sub> not being exhaled efficiently.<ref name="Cheshire2001">{{cite journal |last1=Cheshire |first1 =William P |last2=Ott |first2=Michael C |year=2001 |title=Headache in Divers |journal=Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=235â€“247 |doi=10.1046/j.1526-4610.2001.111006235.x |pmid=11264683 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1526-4610.2001.111006235.x/full |quote=Carbon dioxide can accumulate insidiously in the diver who intentionally holds the breath intermittently (skip breathing) in a mistaken attempt to conserve air}}</ref> There is also an increased risk of burst lung from holding the breath while ascending.  It is counterproductive with a [[rebreather]], where the act of breathing pumps the gas around the "loop", pushing carbon dioxide through the scrubber and mixing freshly injected oxygen.

=== Rebreathers ===

In closed circuit [[Scuba set|SCUBA]] ([[rebreather]]) diving, exhaled carbon dioxide must be removed from the breathing system, usually by a [[scrubber]] containing a solid chemical compound with a high affinity for CO<sub>2</sub>, such as [[soda lime]].<ref name=rebreather2.0>{{cite journal |author=Richardson, Drew; Menduno, Michael; Shreeves, Karl (eds). |title=Proceedings of Rebreather Forum 2.0. |journal=Diving Science and Technology Workshop. |date=1996 |pages=286 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7555 |accessdate=2009-05-16 }}</ref> If not removed from the system, it may be re-inhaled, causing an increase in the inhaled concentration.
