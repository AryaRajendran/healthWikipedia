In [[electrocardiography]], the '''PR interval''' is measured from the beginning of the [[P_wave_(electrocardiography)|P wave]] to the beginning of the [[QRS complex]]. It is usually 120 to 200 ms long. On the usual 25 mm/s [[ECG]] tracing, this corresponds to 3 to 5 small boxes. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the [[sinus node]] through the [[AV node]] where it enters the ventricles. The PR interval is therefore a good estimate of AV node function.

In case a L wave was measured with an ECG, the PR interval is also commonly named "PQ interval" instead.

==Interpretation==
Variations in the PR interval can be associated with certain medical conditions:

* Duration
** A long PR interval (of over 200 ms) may indicate a [[first degree heart block]].<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758322-overview</ref> Prolongation can be associated with [[hypokalemia]], [[acute rheumatic fever]], <ref>http://www.utmb.edu/Pedi_Ed/CoreConceptsOfPediatrics/Cardiology/page_40.htm</ref> or carditis associated with [[Lyme disease]]. <ref>http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/123/5/e835</ref>

** A short PR interval may indicate a [[pre-excitation syndrome]] via an '''accessory pathway''' that leads to early activation of the ventricles, such as seen in [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]].
** A variable PR interval may indicate other types of [[heart block]].
* PR segment depression may indicate atrial injury{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} or [[pericarditis]].<ref>http://www.amc.edu/amr/archives/200408/EKG2_ans.html</ref>
* Variable morphologies of P waves in a single ECG lead is suggestive of an ectopic pacemaker rhythm such as [[wandering pacemaker]] or [[multifocal atrial tachycardia]]
