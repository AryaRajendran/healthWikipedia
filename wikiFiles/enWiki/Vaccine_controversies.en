A '''vaccine controversy''' is a dispute over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, or safety of [[vaccination]]s. Medical and scientific evidence surrounding vaccinations demonstrate that the benefits of preventing suffering and death from [[infectious disease]]s far outweigh rare [[adverse effect]]s of [[immunization]].<ref name="BH" /> However, since vaccination began in the late 18th century, opponents have claimed that vaccines do not work, that they are or may be dangerous, that individuals should rely on personal hygiene instead, or that mandatory vaccinations violate individual rights or religious principles.<ref name="wolfesharp" /> These arguments have reduced vaccination rates in certain communities, resulting in outbreaks of preventable, and sometimes fatal, childhood illnesses.<ref>{{cite news |author=Wallace A |title=An epidemic of fear: how panicked parents skipping shots endangers us all |work=Wired |date=2009-10-19|url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1 |accessdate=2009-10-21 }}</ref>

The success of immunization programs depends on public confidence in their safety. Concerns about immunization safety often follow a pattern: some investigators suggest that a medical condition is an adverse effect of vaccination; a premature announcement is made of the alleged adverse effect; the initial study is not reproduced by other groups; and finally, it takes several years to regain public confidence in the vaccine.<ref name="BH" />

Reaction to vaccine controversies has contributed to a significant increase in preventable diseases including measles<ref>[http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site1884/mainpageS1884P13.html Boston Children's Hospital]</ref> and [[pertussis]] (whooping cough), which is currently experiencing its worst outbreak in 70 years as a result of reduced vaccination rates.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Seattle Times]] | title = State leads nation in kids who aren't getting vaccines | url = http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2015215221_vaccines03m.html | date = June 2, 2011 | accessdate = September 28, 2012 | first = Emily | last = Heffter}}</ref>

== History ==
One of the first documented ideas of vaccinations was in 1721 when [[Cotton Mather|Reverend Cotton Mather]] introduced [[inoculation]] to Boston, Massachusetts during the 1721 smallpox epidemic.<ref name="VaccineControversy">{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Arthur|title=Vaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine's Greatest Lifesaver|year=2007|publisher=W. W.    Norton & Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-05911-3|pages=25–36}}</ref> Most had religious objections to [[inoculation|variolation]], but Mather was able to convince Dr. [[Zabdiel Boylston]] to experiment with inoculation. Boylston first experimented on his 6-year-old son, his slave, and his slave's son; each subject contracted the disease and was sick for several days, until the sickness vanished<!-- is "miraculously vanished" a direct quote? --> and they were "no longer gravely ill".<ref name="VaccineControversy" /> Boylston went on to vaccinate thousands of Massachusetts residents with the result being many places named for him in gratitude. [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] introduced the method of [[variolation]] to England by publicly practising the technique on her children in 1721. Edward Jenner later made the practice safer by inoculating cowpox in order to protect people against smallpox.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bazin|first=Hervé|title=A brief history of the prevention of infectious diseases by immunisations|journal=Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases|date=1|year=2003|month=October|volume=26|issue=5-6|pages=293–308|doi=10.1016/S0147-9571(03)00016-X|accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>  

[[File:Edward Jenner2.jpg|thumb|Edward Jenner]]

[[Vaccination and religion|Religious arguments against inoculation]] were advanced even before the work of [[Edward Jenner]]; for example, in a 1722 sermon entitled "The Dangerous and Sinful Practice of Inoculation" the English theologian Rev. Edmund Massey argued that diseases are sent by God to punish sin and that any attempt to prevent smallpox via inoculation is a "diabolical operation".<ref name="Early" /> Some anti-vaccinationists still base their stance against vaccination with reference to their religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Vaccination - A Crime Against Humanity | url=http://www.ajwrb.org/science/vaccinat.shtml | publisher=The Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood | accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref>

After Jenner's work, vaccination became widespread in the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellner P |title=Smallpox: gone but not forgotten |journal=Infection |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=263–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9795781 |doi=10.1007/BF02962244 }}</ref> [[Inoculation|Variolation]], which had preceded vaccination, was banned in 1840 because of its greater risks. Public policy and successive [[Vaccination Act]]s first encouraged vaccination and then made it mandatory for all infants in 1853, with the highest penalty for refusal being a prison sentence. This was a significant change in the relationship between the British state and its citizens, and there was a public backlash. After an 1867 law extended the requirement age to 14 years, its opponents focused concern on infringement of individual freedom, and eventually an 1898 law allowed for conscientious objection to compulsory vaccination.<ref name="wolfesharp">{{cite journal |author=Wolfe R, Sharp L |title=Anti-vaccinationists past and present |journal=BMJ |volume=325 |issue=7361 |pages=430–2 |year=2002 |pmid=12193361 |doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430 |pmc=1123944 }}</ref>

In the 19th century, the city of [[Leicester]] in the UK achieved a high level of isolation of smallpox cases and great reduction in spread compared to other areas. The mainstay of Leicester's approach to conquering smallpox was to decline vaccination and put their public funds into sanitary improvements.<ref>Leicester and smallpox:

In the US, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] took a close interest in vaccination, alongside Dr. Waterhouse, chief physician at Boston. Jefferson encouraged the development of ways to transport vaccine material through the Southern states, which included measures to avoid damage by heat, a leading cause of ineffective batches. [[Smallpox]] outbreaks were contained by the latter half of the 19th century, a development widely attributed to vaccination of a large portion of the population. Vaccination rates fell after this decline in smallpox cases, and the disease again became epidemic in late 19th century (see ''[[Smallpox]]'').<ref>{{vcite book |editor=Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA |title=Vaccines |author=Henderson DA, Moss B |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=vacc |chapter=Public health |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=vacc&part=A45 |edition=3rd |publishers=W.

Anti-vaccination activity increased again in the US in the late 19th century. After a visit to New York in 1879 by [[William Tebb]], a prominent British anti-vaccinationist, the [[Anti-Vaccination Society of America]] was founded. The New England Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League was formed in 1882, and the Anti-Vaccination League of New York City in 1885.

[[John Pitcairn, Jr.|John Pitcairn]], the wealthy founder of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now [[PPG Industries]]) emerged as a major financier and leader of the American anti-vaccination movement. On March 5, 1907, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he delivered an address to the Committee on Public Health and Sanitation of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] criticizing vaccination.<ref name="vaccination_address">{{cite book |author=Pitcairn J |title=Vaccination |publisher=Anti-Vaccination League of Pennsylvania |year=1907 |url=http://www.archive.org/details/vaccination00pitcgoog |oclc=454411147 }}</ref> He later sponsored the National Anti-Vaccination Conference, which, held in Philadelphia on October, 1908, led to the creation of [[The Anti-Vaccination League of America]]. When the League was organized later that month, Pitcairn was chosen to be its first president.<ref name="Horrors">{{cite book |author=Higgins CM |title=Horrors of Vaccination Exposed and Illustrated |chapter=Life sketch of John Pitcairn by a Philadelphia friend |pages=73–5 |location=Brooklyn, NY |publisher=C.

</ref> On December 1, 1911, he was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor [[John K. Tener]] to the [[Pennsylvania State Vaccination Commission]], and subsequently authored a detailed report strongly opposing the Commission's conclusions.<ref name="Horrors" /> He continued to be a staunch opponent of vaccination until his death in 1916.

In November 1904, in response to years of inadequate sanitation and disease, followed by a poorly explained public health campaign led by the renowned Brazilian public health official [[Oswaldo Cruz]], citizens and military cadets in [[Rio de Janeiro]] arose in a ''Revolta da Vacina'' or [[Vaccine Revolt]]. Riots broke out on the day a vaccination law took effect; vaccination symbolized the most feared and most tangible aspect of a public health plan that included other features such as urban renewal that many had opposed for years.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Lat Am Stud |year=1989 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=241–66 |title= 'Living worse and costing more': resistance and riot in Rio de Janeiro, 1890–1917 |author= Meade T |doi=10.1017/S0022216X00014784}}</ref>

In the early 19th century, the anti-vaccination movement drew members from across a wide range of society; more recently, it has been reduced to a predominantly middle-class phenomenon.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=98 |issue=8 |year=2005 |pages=384–5 |title= The anti-vaccination movement in England, 1853–1907 |author= Fitzpatrick M |doi=10.1258/jrsm.98.8.384}}</ref> Arguments against vaccines in the 21st century are often similar to those of 19th-century anti-vaccinationists.<ref name="wolfesharp" />

20th century events include the 1982 broadcast of "DPT: Vaccine Roulette" sparking debate over the [[DPT vaccine]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientist: autism paper had catastrophic effects |work=NPR |date=2010-02-07 |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123472234 }}</ref> and the 1998 publication of an academic article (later discredited) which sparked the [[MMR vaccine controversy]].

== Effectiveness ==

Scientific evidence for the effectiveness of large-scale vaccination campaigns is well-established.

Some opponents of vaccination argue that these reductions in infectious disease are a result of improved sanitation and hygiene (rather than vaccination), or that these diseases were already in decline before the introduction of specific vaccines. These claims are not supported by scientific data; the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases tended to fluctuate over time until the introduction of specific vaccines, at which point the incidence dropped to near zero. A [[Centers for Disease Control]] website aimed at countering common misconceptions about vaccines argued: "Are we expected to believe that better sanitation caused incidence of each disease to drop, just at the time a vaccine for that disease was introduced?"<ref name="CDC: common misconceptions">{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm | title = Some common misconceptions about vaccination and how to respond to them | publisher = [[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | accessdate = September 28, 2012}}</ref>

Other critics argue that immunity given by vaccines is only temporary and requires boosters, whereas those who survive the disease become permanently immune.<ref name="wolfesharp" /> As discussed below, the philosophies of some [[#Alternative medicine|alternative medicine]] practitioners are incompatible with the idea that vaccines are effective.<ref name="Ernst" />

=== Population health ===
Lack of complete vaccine coverage increases the risk of disease for the entire population, including those who have been vaccinated, because it reduces [[herd immunity]]. For example, measles vaccine targets children between the ages of 9 and 12 months, and the short window between the disappearance of maternal antibody (before which the vaccine often fails to [[seroconversion|seroconvert]]) and natural infection means that vaccinated children frequently are still vulnerable. Herd immunity lessens this vulnerability, if all the children are vaccinated. Increasing herd immunity during an outbreak or threatened outbreak is perhaps the most widely accepted justification for mass vaccination. Mass vaccination also helps to increase coverage rapidly, thus obtaining herd immunity, when a new vaccine is introduced.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heymann DL, Aylward RB |title=Mass vaccination: when and why |journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |volume=304 |pages=1–16 |year=2006 |pmid=16989261 |doi=10.1007/3-540-36583-4_1 |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |isbn=978-3-540-29382-8 }}</ref>

=== Cost-effectiveness ===
Commonly-used vaccines are a cost-effective and preventive way of promoting health, compared to the treatment of acute or chronic disease. In the US during the year 2001, routine [[vaccination schedule|childhood immunizations]] against seven diseases were estimated to save over $40 billion per birth-year cohort in overall social costs including $10 billion in direct [[health economics|health costs]], and the societal benefit-cost ratio for these vaccinations was estimated to be 16.5.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou F, Santoli J, Messonnier ML ''et al.

; Stockholm, smallpox (1873–74)

An anti-vaccination campaign motivated by religious objections, by concerns about effectiveness, and by concerns about individual rights, led to the vaccination rate in Stockholm dropping to just over 40%, compared to about 90% elsewhere in Sweden. A major smallpox [[epidemic]] then started in 1873.

In a 1974 report ascribing 36 reactions to [[pertussis|whooping cough]] (pertussis) vaccine, a prominent public-health academic claimed that the vaccine was only marginally effective and questioned whether its benefits outweigh its risks, and extended television and press coverage caused a scare. Vaccine uptake in the UK decreased from 81% to 31% and pertussis epidemics followed, leading to deaths of some children. Mainstream medical opinion continued to support the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine; public confidence was restored after the publication of a national reassessment of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine uptake then increased to levels above 90% and disease incidence declined dramatically.<ref name="Gangarosa_pertussis">{{cite journal |journal=Lancet |year=1998 |volume=351 |issue=9099 |pages=356–61 |title= Impact of anti-vaccine movements on pertussis control: the untold story |author= Gangarosa EJ, Galazka AM, Wolfe CR ''et al.

Subsequently, polio reappeared in a dozen formerly polio-free neighbors of Nigeria, and genetic tests showed the virus was the same one that originated in northern Nigeria: Nigeria had become a net exporter of polio virus to its African neighbors.

Concerns about immunization safety often follow a pattern. First, some investigators suggest that a medical condition of increasing prevalence or unknown cause is an adverse effect of vaccination. The initial study, and subsequent studies by the same group, have inadequate methodology, typically a poorly controlled or uncontrolled case series. A premature announcement is made of the alleged adverse effect, resonating with individuals suffering the condition, and underestimating the potential harm to those whom the vaccine could protect. The initial study is not reproduced by other groups. Finally, it takes several years to regain public confidence in the vaccine.<ref name="BH" /> Adverse effects ascribed to vaccines typically have an unknown origin, an increasing [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], some [[biological plausibility]], occurrences close to the time of vaccination, and dreaded outcomes.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Leask J, Chapman S, Cooper Robbins SC |title="All manner of ills": The features of serious diseases attributed to vaccination |journal=Vaccine |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |pmid=19879997 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.10.042 }}</ref>

Controversies in this area revolve around the question of whether the risks of perceived adverse events following immunization outweigh the benefits of preventing adverse effects of common diseases. There is scientific evidence that in rare cases immunizations can cause adverse events, such as oral [[polio vaccine]] causing [[paralysis]].

Vaccine overload is the notion that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immature immune system and lead to adverse effects.<ref name="Hilton" /> Although the scientific evidence strongly contradicts this idea,<ref name="Gerber" /> some parents of autistic children believe that vaccine overload causes autism.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hurst L |title=Vaccine phobia runs deep |work=Toronto Star |date=2009-10-30 |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/article/718829 |accessdate=2009-11-04 }}</ref> The resulting controversy has caused many parents to delay or avoid immunizing their children.<ref name="Hilton">{{cite journal |author=Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K |title='Combined vaccines are like a sudden onslaught to the body's immune system': parental concerns about vaccine 'overload' and 'immune-vulnerability' |journal=Vaccine |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=4321–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16581162 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.03.003 }}</ref> Such parental misperceptions are major obstacles towards immunization of children.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An internet-based survey on parental attitudes towards immunization |author=Heininger U |journal=Vaccine |year=2006 |volume=24 |issue=37–39 |pages=6351–5 |pmid=16784799 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.029 }}</ref>

The concept of vaccine overload is flawed on several levels.<ref name="Gerber" /> Despite the increase in the number of vaccines over recent decades, improvements in vaccine design have reduced the immunologic load from vaccines; the total number of immunological components in the 14 vaccines administered to US children in 2009 is less than 10% of what it was in the 7 vaccines given in 1980.<ref name="Gerber">{{cite journal |author= Gerber JS, Offit PA |title= Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses |journal= Clin Infect Dis |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=456–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19128068 |pmc= 2908388 |doi=10.1086/596476 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476 |laysummary=http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=13336 |laysource=IDSA |laydate=2009-01-30}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>  A study published on 2013 found no correlation between autism and the [[antigen]] number in the vaccines the children were administered up to the age of two.

Any experiment based on withholding vaccines from children has been considered unethical,<ref>{{cite pmid|17080029}}</ref> and observational studies would likely be [[Confounding|confounded]] by differences in health-care-seeking behaviours of under-vaccinated children. Thus, no study directly comparing rates of autism in vaccinated vs. un-vaccinated children has been done. However, the concept of vaccine overload is biologically implausible, vaccinated and unvaccinated children have the same immune response to non-vaccine related infections, and autism is not an immune-mediated disease, so claims that vaccines could cause it by overloading the immune system goes against current knowledge of the [[pathogenesis]] of autism. As such, the idea that vaccines cause autism has been effectively dismissed by the weight of current evidence.<ref name="Gerber" /> A 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as "the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years".<ref name=Klaherty>{{cite journal |author=Flaherty DK |title=The vaccine-autism connection: a public health crisis caused by unethical medical practices and fraudulent science |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=1302–4 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21917556 |doi=10.1345/aph.1Q318}}</ref>

=== Thiomersal ===

In 1999, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove the [[organomercury]] compound [[thiomersal]] (spelled "thimerosal" in the US) from vaccines as quickly as possible, and thiomersal has been phased out of US and European vaccines, except for some preparations of [[influenza vaccine]].<ref name="Offit">{{cite journal |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1278–9 |title=Thimerosal and vaccines—a cautionary tale |author=[[Paul Offit|Offit PA]] |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078187 |pmid=17898096 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1278}}</ref> The CDC and the AAP followed the [[precautionary principle]], which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unwarranted, but their 1999 action sparked confusion and controversy that has diverted attention and resources away from efforts to determine the causes of autism.<ref name="Offit" /> Since 2000, the thiomersal in child vaccines has been alleged to contribute to [[autism]], and thousands of parents in the United States have pursued legal compensation from a federal fund.<ref name="Sugarman">{{cite journal |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1275–7 |title=Cases in vaccine court—legal battles over vaccines and autism |author=Sugarman SD |pmid=17898095 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1275 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078168}}</ref> A 2004 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) committee favored rejecting any causal relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism.<ref name="ISRC">{{cite book |author=Immunization Safety Review Committee |title=Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism |publisher=The National Academies Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-309-09237-X |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10997 }}</ref> Autism incidence rates increased steadily even after thiomersal was removed from childhood vaccines.<ref name="Gerber" /> Currently there is no accepted scientific evidence that exposure to thiomersal is a factor in causing autism.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |year=2006 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=341–6 |title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature |author=Doja A, Roberts W |pmid=17168158}}</ref>

For example, the [[principle of double effect]], originated by [[Thomas Aquinas]], holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/files/nnii/files/Moral_Considerations_With_Certain_Viral_Vaccines.pdf |format=PDF |title= Moral considerations with certain viral vaccines |author= Grabenstein JD |journal= Christ Pharm |issn=1094-9534 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=3–6 |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref> The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have "...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems."<ref name="Vatican">{{cite journal |author= Pontifical Academy for Life |title= Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human foetuses |year=2005 |journal= Medicina e Morale |publisher=Center for Bioethics, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart |url=http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&pag=testo/vacc/vacc&lang=english |accessdate=2008-12-03}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for [[Catholic]]s to use the existing vaccine, writing, "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible."<ref name="Vatican" />

== Alternative medicine ==
Many forms of [[alternative medicine]] are based on philosophies that oppose vaccination and have practitioners who voice their opposition. These include some elements of the [[chiropractic]] community, some [[homeopathy|homoeopaths]], and [[naturopathy|naturopaths]].<ref name="Ernst">{{cite journal |journal=Vaccine |year=2001 |volume=20 |issue= Suppl 1 |pages=S89–93 |title= Rise in popularity of complementary and alternative medicine: reasons and consequences for vaccination |author= Ernst E |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(01)00290-0 |pmid=11587822}}</ref> The reasons for this negative vaccination view are complicated and rest, at least in part, on the early philosophies which shape the foundation of these groups.<ref name="Ernst" />

=== Chiropractic ===
Historically [[chiropractic]] strongly opposed vaccination based on its belief that all diseases were traceable to causes in the spine, and therefore could not be affected by vaccines; [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel D. Palmer]], the founder of chiropractic, wrote, "It is the very height of absurdity to strive to 'protect' any person from smallpox or any other malady by inoculating them with a filthy animal poison."<ref name="Busse" /> Vaccination remains controversial within the profession.<ref name="Campbell" /> Although most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects,<ref name="Busse" /> antivaccination sentiment is espoused by what appears to be a minority of chiropractors.<ref name="Campbell" /> The [[American Chiropractic Association]] and the International Chiropractic Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws; a 1995 survey of US chiropractors found that about one third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.<ref name="Campbell">{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2000 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=e43 |title= Chiropractors and vaccination: a historical perspective |author= Campbell JB, Busse JW, Injeyan HS |pmid=10742364 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e43 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.4.e43}}</ref> While the Canadian Chiropractic Association supports vaccination,<ref name="Busse">{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |year=2005 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=367–73 |title= Chiropractic antivaccination arguments |author= Busse JW, Morgan L, Campbell JB |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.04.011 |pmid=15965414 |url= http://jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(05)00111-9/fulltext}}</ref> a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% advised against, vaccinations for patients or their children.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Russell ML, Injeyan HS, Verhoef MJ, Eliasziw M |title= Beliefs and behaviours: understanding chiropractors and immunization |journal=Vaccine |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=372–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15530683 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.05.027}}</ref>

Although most chiropractic colleges try to teach about vaccination responsibly, several have faculty who seem to stress negative views.<ref name="Campbell" /> A survey of a 1999–2000 cross section of students of [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]], which does not formally teach antivaccination views, reported that fourth-year students opposed vaccination more strongly than first-years, with 29.4% of fourth-years opposing vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Vaccine |year=2008 |volume=26 |issue=49 |pages=6237–42 |title= Attitudes towards vaccination among chiropractic and naturopathic students |author= Busse JW, Wilson K, Campbell JB |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.07.020 |pmid=18674581}}</ref>

=== Homeopathy ===
Several surveys have shown that some practitioners of [[homeopathy]], particularly homeopaths without any medical training, advise patients against vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt K, Ernst E |title=MMR vaccination advice over the Internet |journal=Vaccine |volume=21 |issue=11–12 |pages=1044–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12559777 |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00628-X}}</ref> For example, a survey of registered homeopaths in Austria found that only 28% considered immunization to be an important preventive measure, and 83% of homeopaths surveyed in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]] did not recommend vaccination.<ref name="Ernst" /> Many practitioners of [[naturopathy]] also oppose vaccination.<ref name="Ernst" />

[[homeopathy|Homeopathic]] vaccines are ineffective because they do not stimulate the immune system. They can be dangerous if they take the place of effective treatments.<ref name="SciMed">{{cite web |title=Homeopathic Vaccines|author=Mark Crislip|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8003}}</ref>

== Financial motives ==
Critics have accused the vaccine industry of misrepresenting the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, covering up and suppressing information, and influencing health policy decisions for financial gain.<ref name="wolfesharp" /> Conversely, many groups profit by promoting the controversiality of vaccines, such as lawyers who receive fees often totalling in the millions of dollars, expert witnesses paid to provide testimony and to speak at conferences, and practitioners of alternative medicine offering ineffective and expensive medications, supplements, and procedures such as [[chelation therapy]] and [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]].<ref>{{cite book |format=PhD thesis |author=Kerr MA |chapter=Movement impact |pages=194–203 |title=The Autism Spectrum Disorders / vaccine link debate: a health social movement |year=2009 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |url=http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-04302009-115908/unrestricted/Kerr_FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-02-25 }}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

In the late 20th century, vaccines were a product with low [[profit margin]]s,<ref name="Sheridan" /> and the number of companies involved in vaccine manufacture declined. In addition to low profits and liability risks, manufacturers complained about low prices paid for vaccines by the CDC and other US government agencies.<ref>{{cite book |author= Allen A |year=2007 |title=Vaccine: the Controversial Story of Medicine's Greatest Lifesafer |chapter=Epilogue: our best shots |pages=421–42 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-05911-1}}</ref> In the early 21st century, the vaccine market greatly improved with the approval of the vaccine [[Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine|Prevnar]], along with a small number of other highly-priced [[Pharmaceutical drug|blockbuster vaccines]] such as [[Gardasil]] and [[Pediarix]] that each provided sales revenues of over $1 billion in 2008.<ref name="Sheridan">{{cite journal |author=Sheridan C |title=Vaccine market boosters |journal=Nat Biotechnol |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=499–501 |year=2009 |pmid=19513043 |doi=10.1038/nbt0609-499 }}</ref>

== Dispute resolution ==
{{Main|Vaccine court}}
The US Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death. It is funded by a 75 cent [[excise]] tax on vaccines sold in the country and was established after a scare in the 1980s over the [[DPT vaccine]]: even though claims of side effects were later generally discredited, large jury awards had been given to some claimants of DPT vaccine injuries, and most DPT vaccine makers had ceased production. Claims against vaccine manufacturers must be heard first in the vaccine court.<ref name="Sugarman" /> By 2008 the fund had paid out 2,114 awards totaling $1.7 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm |accessdate=2008-01-22 |date=2008-01-08 |title= National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program statistics reports |publisher= Health Resources and Services Administration}}</ref> Thousands of cases of autism-related claims are pending before the court.<ref name="Sugarman" /> In 2008 the government conceded one case concerning a child who had a pre-existing [[Mitochondrial disease|mitochondrial disorder]] and whose autism-like symptoms appeared around the same time the child was vaccinated.<ref>Poling case:
