'''Endothelium-derived relaxing factor''' ('''EDRF''') is produced and released by the [[endothelium]] to promote smooth muscle relaxation. The best-characterized is [[nitric oxide]] (NO).  Some sources equate EDRF and nitric oxide.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000038536|endothelial-derived relaxing factor}}</ref>

It is released in response to a variety of chemical and physical stimuli. It causes the [[smooth muscle]] in the vessel wall to relax.

''EDRF'' was discovered and characterized by [[Robert F. Furchgott]], a winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1998 with his co-researchers [[Louis J. Ignarro]] and [[Ferid Murad]].

According to Furchgott's website at [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center]], "...we are investigating whether the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is simply nitric oxide or a mixture of substances".<ref name="urlRobert Furchgott">{{cite web |url=http://www.hscbklyn.edu/pharmacology/furch.htm |title=Robert Furchgott |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-21}}</ref>

Although there is strong evidence that nitric oxide elicits vasodilation, there is some evidence tying this effect to neuronal rather than endothelial reactions.<ref name="pmid11319669">{{cite journal |author=Chowdhary S, Townend JN |title=Nitric oxide and hypertension: not just an endothelium derived relaxing factor! |journal=J Hum Hypertens |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=219â€“27 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11319669 |doi=10.1038/sj.jhh.1001165}}</ref>
