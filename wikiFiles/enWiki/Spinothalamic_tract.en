The '''spinothalamic tract''' is a sensory pathway originating in the spinal cord. It is one component of the [[anterolateral system]]. It transmits information to the [[thalamus]] about [[pain]], [[temperature]], [[itch]] and crude [[tactition|touch]]. The pathway [[decussates]] at the level of the [[spinal cord]], rather than in the [[brainstem]] like the [[posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway]] and [[corticospinal tract]].

==Tracts==
There are two main parts of the spinothalamic tract (STT): 
* The [[lateral spinothalamic tract]] transmits [[pain]] and [[temperature]].
* The [[anterior spinothalamic tract]] (or ''ventral'' spinothalamic tract) transmits crude touch and pressure.

==Information transmitted==
The types of sensory information transmitted via the spinothalamic tract are described as ''[[affective sensation]]''. This means that the sensation is accompanied by a compulsion to act. For instance, an itch is accompanied by a need to scratch, and a painful stimulus makes us want to withdraw from the pain.

==Sub-systems==

There are two sub-systems identified: 
* Direct (for direct conscious appreciation of pain) 
* Indirect (for affective and arousal impact of pain). Indirect projections include 
** Spino-Reticulo-Thalamo-Cortical (part of the [[ascending reticular arousal system]], aka ARAS) 
** Spino-Mesencephalic-Limbic (for affective impact of pain).

==Path of sensation==

The Spinothalamic Tract, like the [[Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus Tract]], use three neurons to convey sensory information from the periphery to conscious level at the cerebral cortex.

[[Pseudounipolar]] [[neuron]]s in the [[dorsal root ganglion]] have axons that lead from the [[skin]] into the dorsal [[spinal cord]] where they ascend or descend one or two vertebral levels via [[Lissauer's tract]] and then [[synapse]] with secondary neurons in either the [[substantia gelatinosa]] or the [[nucleus proprius]]. These secondary neurons are called ''tract cells''.

The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the [[anterior white commissure]], and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the [[anterolateral system]]). Decussation usually occurs 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the [[brainstem]], specifically the [[rostral ventromedial medulla]].  

Traveling up the brainstem, the tract moves dorsally. The neurons ultimately synapse with third-order neurons in several nuclei of the thalamus -- including the medial dorsal, ventral posterior lateral, and ventral medial posterior nuclei. From there, signals go to the [[cingulate cortex]], the [[primary somatosensory cortex]], and [[insular cortex]] respectively.

==Lesions==

Unilateral lesion usually causes contralateral [[anaesthesia]] (loss of pain and temperature).  Anaesthesia will normally begin 1-2 segments below the level of lesion, affecting all caudal body areas.  This is clinically tested by using pin pricks.
