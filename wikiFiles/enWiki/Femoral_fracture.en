A '''femoral fracture''' is a [[bone fracture]] that involves the [[femur]]. It includes [[hip fracture]]s.

==Classification==
A femoral fracture that involves the [[femoral head]], [[femoral neck]] or the [[shaft of the femur]] immediately below the lesser trochanter may be classified as a [[hip fracture]], especially when associated with [[osteoporosis]].

â€¢	Three types of femoral shaft fractures
Type 1: Spiral or transverse
Type 2: Comminuted
Type 3: Open


[[Femoral shaft]] fractures can be classified with the Winquist and Hansen classification, which is based on the amount of [[comminution]]:<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=zSy-FzCbWBkC&pg=PA612 Page 612] in: Title	Surgical treatment of orthopaedic trauma.

*Grade I or 1: transverse or short oblique fractures with no comminution or a small butterfly fragment of less than 25% of width of the bone
*Grade II or 2: a comminuted with a butterfly fragment of 50% or less of the width of the bone
*Grade III or 3: comminuted with a large butterfly fragment of greater than 50% of the width of bone
*Grade IV or 4: Segmental comminution

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the part of the femur that is fractured. Traction may be useful for femoral shaft fractures but is contraindicated in femoral neck fractures.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli)) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
