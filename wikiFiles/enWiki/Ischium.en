The '''ischium''' forms the lower and back part of the [[hip bone]] (''os coxae'').  The word ''ischium'' dates back to c. 164o B.C.E., from Greek ἰσχίον '''iskhion''' meaning "hip joint", in plural, "the hips", and most likely comes from ισχύς '''iskhys''' "loin", which is of unknown origin.<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ischium</ref>

Situated below the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] and behind the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]], it is one of these three bones whose fusion creates the [[hip|coxa]]. The superior portion of this bone forms approximately one third of the [[acetabulum]].

It is divisible into three portions:
* [[Body of ischium]] - Contains a prominent spine which serves as the origin for [[gemellus superior]]. The indentation inferior to the spine is the [[lesser sciatic notch]]. Continuing down the posterior side, the [[ischial tuberosity]] is a thick, rough surfaced prominence below the lesser sciatic notch. This is the portion that supports weight while sitting (especially noticeable on a hard surface). It can be felt simply by sitting on one’s fingers. Additionally, it serves as the origin for [[gemellus inferior]] and [[adductor magnus]].
* [[Superior ramus of the ischium]] - Serves as a partial origin for [[obturator internus]] and [[obturator externus]].
* [[Inferior ramus of the ischium]] - Serves as a partial origin for [[Gracilis muscle|gracillis]] and [[adductor magnus]].

The [[ischial ramus]] joins the inferior ramus of the pubis anteriorly. It is the strongest of the coxal bones.

Clinically, [[avulsion fracture]] of the [[ischial apophysis]] may occur (Wootton 1990).<ref>[http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/reprint/72-B/4/625.pdf Avulsion of the ischial apophysis]  J. R. Wootton, M. J. Cross, K. W. G. Holt - ''Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, British Volume''. Volume 72-B, No. 4. Date: 1990-07. Retrieved: 2010-05-16.</ref>

Avulsion fractures of the hip bone (avulsion or tearing away of the ischial tuberosity) may occur in adolescents and young adults during sports that require sudden acceleration or deceleration forces, such as sprinting or kicking in football, soccer, jumping hurdles, basketball, and martial arts. These fractures occur at [[Tubercle (anatomy)|apophyses]] (bony projections that lack secondary [[ossification center]]s). Avulsion fractures occur where muscles are attached: anterior superior and inferior iliac spines, ischial tuberosities, and ischiopubic rami. A small part of bone with a piece of a tendon or ligament attached is avulsed (torn away) (Moore 2006).

The [[clade]] [[Dinosaur]]ia is divided into the [[Saurischia]] and [[Ornithischia]] based on [[pelvis|hip structure]], including importantly that of the ischium.<ref>Seeley, H.G. (1888).
