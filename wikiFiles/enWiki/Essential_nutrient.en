An '''essential nutrient''' is  a [[nutrient]] required for normal body functioning that either cannot be synthesized by the body at all, or cannot be synthesized in amounts adequate for good health (e.g. [[niacin]], [[choline]]), and thus must be obtained from a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] source. Essential nutrients are also defined by the collective physiological evidence for their importance in the diet, as represented in e.g. US government approved tables for [[Dietary Reference Intake]].<ref>{{cite web | title = National Academy of Sciences. Institute of Medicine. Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary Guidance: DRI Tables | publisher = US Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Library and National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board| url = http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&tax_level=3&tax_subject=256&topic_id=1342&level3_id=5140 |month=October | year=2009}}</ref>

Some categories of essential nutrients include [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary minerals]], [[essential fatty acid]]s, and [[essential amino acid]]s. Different species have very different essential nutrients. For example, most mammals synthesize their own [[ascorbic acid]], and it is therefore not considered an essential nutrient for such species. It is, however, an essential nutrient for human beings, who require external sources of ascorbic acid (known as Vitamin C in the context of nutrition).

Many essential nutrients are toxic in large doses (see [[hypervitaminosis]] or the nutrient pages themselves below). Some can be taken in amounts larger than required in a typical diet, with no apparent ill effects.  [[Linus Pauling]] said of [[Niacin|vitamin B<SUB>3</SUB>]], (either niacin or niacinamide), "What astonished me was the very low toxicity of a substance that has such very great physiological power. A little pinch, 5&nbsp;mg, every day, is enough to keep a person from dying of [[pellagra]], but it is so lacking in toxicity that ten thousand times as much can [sometimes] be taken without harm."<ref>{{cite book|author=Pauling, L.|title=How to Live Longer and Feel Better|year=1986|publisher=Avon Books Inc.|location=New York NY 10019| isbn=0-380-70289-4}} Page 24.</ref> 


==For humans==
===Fatty acids===
{{see also|Essential fatty acid}}
Essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized by humans, as humans lack the [[desaturase]] enzymes required for their production.

* [[Alpha-linolenic acid|α-Linolenic acid]] (ALA, 18:3), an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]
* [[Linoleic acid]] (LA, 18:2), an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]

α-Linolenic acid is not used by the body in its original form. It is broken down by the body into the required long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA, 20:5) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA, 22:6). EPA and DHA can also be consumed from a direct source by consuming fish or fish oil.

Linoleic acid is not used by the body in its original form either. It is broken down by the body into the required long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA, 18:3), [[dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid]] (DGLA, 20:3) and [[arachidonic acid]] (AA, 20:4).

[[Omega-9 fatty acid]]s are not essential in humans, because humans generally possess all the enzymes required for their synthesis.

The required quantity varies widely between nutrients. At one extreme, a 70&nbsp;kg human contains 1.0&nbsp;kg of calcium, but only 3&nbsp;mg of cobalt.

===Elements with speculated role in human health===
{{Seealso|Ultratrace element}}
Many elements have been implicated at various times to have a role in human health. For none of these elements, however, has a specific protein, complex or [[dietary reference intake]] been established.
