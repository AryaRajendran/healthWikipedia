'''Pertussis''' — commonly called '''whooping cough''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|uː|p|ɪ|ŋ|_|k|ɒ|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|uː|p|ɪ|ŋ|_|k|ɒ|f}}) — is a highly contagious [[bacterial disease]] caused by ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]''. In some countries, this disease is called the 100 days' cough or cough of 100 days.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carbonetti NH |title=Immunomodulation in the pathogenesis of Bordetella pertussis infection and disease |journal=Curr Opin Pharmacol |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=272–8 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17418639 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2006.12.004 }}</ref>

Symptoms are initially mild, and then develop into severe coughing fits, which produce the namesake high-pitched "whoop" sound in infected babies and children when they inhale air after coughing.<ref>[http://www.whoopingcough.net/symptoms.htm Symptoms, sounds, and a video] WhoopingCough.net</ref> The coughing stage lasts approximately six weeks before subsiding.

Prevention by [[vaccination]] is of primary importance given the seriousness of the disease in children.<ref name=Update10/> Although treatment is of little direct benefit to the person infected, [[Antibacterial|antibiotic]]s are recommended because they shorten the duration of infectiousness.<ref name=Update10/> It is estimated that the disease currently affects 48.5&nbsp;million people yearly, resulting in nearly 295,000&nbsp;deaths.<ref name=CD003257/>  [http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pubs-tools/audio-video.html Listen to the sounds of pertussis] and [http://shotbyshot.org/story-gallery/#Pertussis view personal stories] of people affected by pertussis.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The classic symptoms of pertussis are a [[paroxysmal]] cough, inspiratory whoop, and [[vomiting]] after coughing.<ref name=JAMA2010>{{cite journal |author=Cornia PB, Hersh AL, Lipsky BA, Newman TB, Gonzales R |title=Does this coughing adolescent or adult patient have pertussis? |journal=JAMA |volume=304 |issue=8 |pages=890–6 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20736473 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.1181 }}</ref> The cough from pertussis has been documented to cause [[subconjunctival hemorrhage]]s, [[rib fracture]]s, urinary incontinence, [[hernias]], post-cough [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], and [[vertebral artery dissection]].<ref name=JAMA2010/> Violent coughing can cause the [[pleura]] to rupture, leading to a [[pneumothorax]]. If there is vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, the likelihood almost doubles that the illness is pertussis. On the other hand, the absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive [[emesis]] makes it almost half as likely.<ref name="JAMA2010"/>

The [[incubation period]] is typically seven to ten days in infants or young children, after which there are usually mild respiratory symptoms, mild coughing, sneezing, or runny nose. This is known as the [[catarrhal]] stage. After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, each with five to ten forceful coughs, followed by a high-pitched "whoop" sound in younger children, or a gasping sound in older children, as the patient struggles to breathe in afterwards ([[Paroxysmal attack|paroxysmal]] stage). 

Fits can occur on their own or can be triggered by yawning, stretching, laughing, eating or yelling; they usually occur in groups, with multiple episodes every hour around the clock. This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to two weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, both in frequency and severity, and a cessation of vomiting.
A tendency to produce the "whooping" sound after coughing may remain for a considerable period after the disease itself has cleared up.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Bordetella pertussis.jpg|thumb|250px|Gram stain of the bacteria Bordetella pertussis]]
Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include [[microbiological culture|culturing]] of nasopharyngeal swabs on [[Bordet-Gengou agar|Bordet-Gengou medium]], [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescence]] (DFA), and [[serology|serological]] methods. The bacteria can be recovered from the patient only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks. 

For most adults and adolescents, who often do not seek medical care until several weeks into their illness, serology may be used to determine whether antibody against [[pertussis toxin]] or another component of ''B. pertussis'' is present at high levels in the blood of the patient. By this stage they have been contagious for some weeks and may have spread the infection to many people. Because of this, adults, who are not in great danger from pertussis, are increasingly being encouraged to be vaccinated.

A similar, milder disease is caused by ''[[Bordetella parapertussis|B. parapertussis]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author = Finger H, von Koenig CHW | title = Bordetella–Clinical Manifestations.

==Prevention==
The primary method of prevention for pertussis is [[vaccination]]. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed but are without symptoms.<ref name=Cochrane07>{{cite journal|last=Altunaiji|first=S|coauthors=Kukuruzovic, R, Curtis, N, Massie, J|title=Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis).|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2007-07-18|issue=3|pages=CD004404|pmid=17636756|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004404.pub3}}</ref> Prophylactic antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).<ref name=Update10/>

=== Vaccine ===

The duration of protection is between five to ten years. This covers childhood, which is the time of greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from pertussis.<ref name=JAMA2010/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Versteegh FGA, Schellekens JFP, Fleer A, Roord JJ. | title = Pertussis: a concise historical review including diagnosis, incidence, clinical manifestations and the role of treatment and vaccination in management. | journal = Rev Med Microbiol | year = 2005 | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 79–89 | url= http://www.revmedmicrobiol.com/pt/re/revmedmicrob/abstract.00013542-200508000-00001.htm }}</ref> For children, the [[Immunization (medicine)|immunization]]s are commonly given in combination with immunizations against [[tetanus]], [[diphtheria]], [[polio]] and [[haemophilus influenzae type B]], at ages two, four, six, and 15–18 months. A single later booster is given at four to six years of age. (US schedule). In the UK, pertussis vaccinations are given at 2, 3 and 4 months, with a pre-school booster at 3 years 4 months.

A 2011 study by the CDC indicated that the duration of protection may only last three to six years. Dr. [[Paul Offit]], chief of the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]], comments that the last pertussis vaccination people receive may be their booster at age 11 or 12 years old. However, he states that it is important for adults to have immunity as well to prevent transmission of the disease to infants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rettner|first=Rachael|title=Whooping Cough Vaccine Protection Fades After 3 Years|url=http://www.myhealthnewsdaily.com/whopping-cough-pertussis-vaccine-immunity-2025/|publisher=My Health News Daily|accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>

The pertussis component of the DPT vaccine accounted for most of the minor local and systemic side effects in many vaccinated infants (such as mild fever or soreness at the injection site).

Immunization against pertussis does not confer lifelong immunity. While adults rarely die if they contract pertussis after the effects of their childhood vaccinations have worn off, they may transmit the disease to people at much higher risk of injury or death. To reduce morbidity and spread of the disease, Canada, France, the U.S. and Germany have approved pertussis vaccine booster shots. The pertussis booster for adults is combined with a tetanus vaccine and diphtheria vaccine booster; this combination is abbreviated "[[Tdap]]" (Tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis).  

It is similar to the childhood vaccine called "DTaP" (Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis), with the main difference that the adult version contains smaller amounts of the diphtheria and pertussis components—this is indicated in the name by the use of lower-case "d" and "p" for the adult vaccine.  The lower-case "a" in each vaccine indicates that the pertussis component is acellular, or cell-free, which improves safety by dramatically reducing the incidence of side effects.  Adults should request the [[Tdap]] instead of just a tetanus shot in order to receive the multi-vaccine.

Infection with pertussis induces incomplete natural immunity that wanes over time.<ref>Disease Control Priorities Project. (2006).

The newer acellular vaccine, known as [[DPT vaccine|DTaP]], has greatly reduced the incidence of [[adverse effect]]s compared to the earlier "whole-cell" pertussis vaccine.<ref>{{cite web | title=Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed, ADACEL, Aventis Pasteur Ltd | url=http://www.fda.gov/Cber/products/tdapave061005.htm | accessdate = 2006-05-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070216224327/http://www.fda.gov/Cber/products/tdapave061005.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-16}}</ref>

In 2012, a federal advisory panel recommended that all U.S. adults receive vaccination.<ref>http://apnews.myway.com/article/20120222/D9T2I3JG4.html</ref> Later that year, health officials in the UK recommended the vaccination of pregnant women (between 28 - 38 weeks of pregnancy) in order to protect their unborn children. Designed to protect babies from birth until their first standard vaccination at eight weeks of age, this vaccine was introduced in response to the ongoing outbreak of pertussis in the UK, the worst in over a decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19729989#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa |title=BBC News - Whooping cough outbreak: Pregnant women to be vaccinated}}</ref>

== Management ==
Persons with pertussis are infectious from the beginning of the catarrhal stage (runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, symptoms of the common cold) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.

A reasonable guideline is to treat persons aged >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants aged <1 year and pregnant women (especially near term) within 6 weeks of cough onset.  If the patient is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness and, even without antibiotics, the patient should no longer be spreading pertussis.<ref name=Update10>{{cite journal|last=Heininger|first=U|title=Update on pertussis in children.|journal=Expert review of anti-infective therapy|date=2010 Feb|volume=8|issue=2|pages=163–73|pmid=20109046|doi=10.1586/eri.09.124}}</ref>  Antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness and thus prevent spread.<ref name=Update10/>

The antibiotic [[erythromycin]] or [[azithromycin]] is a front line treatment<ref name=Cochrane07/> Newer [[macrolides]] are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects.<ref name=Update10/> [[Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]] may be used in those with allergies to first line agents or in infants who have a risk of [[pyloric stenosis]] from macrolides.<ref name=Update10/> Effective treatments of the [[cough]] associated with this condition have not yet been developed.<ref name=CD003257/>

;Infants aged <1 year
Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are preferred for the treatment of pertussis in persons ≥1 month of age.

=== Antibiotics ===
* Azithromycin
* Erythromycin
* Clarithromycin
* TMP--SMZ

== Prognosis ==
Common complications of the disease include [[pneumonia]], [[encephalopathy]], earache, or [[seizure]]s.

Most healthy older children and adults will have a full recovery from pertussis, however those with comorbid conditions can have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.

Infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 1.6% of hospitalized infants who are under one year of age.<ref>{{cite web|title=CDC - Pertussis: Complications|url=http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/complications.html|work=cdc.gov|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref>  Infants under one are also more likely to develop complications (e.g., pneumonia (20%), encephalopathy, seizures (1%), failure to thrive, and death (0.2%). Pertussis can cause severe paroxysm-induced cerebral hypoxia and apnea. Reported fatalities from pertussis in infants have increased substantially over the past 20 years.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Guinto-Ocampo| first = Hazel| coauthors = Bryon K McNeil, Stephen C Aronoff| title = Pertussis: Follow-up| journal = Emedicine| publisher = WebMD| date = April 27, 2010| url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967268-followup | accessdate = September 29, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
''B. pertussis'' was isolated in pure culture in 1906 by [[Jules Bordet]] and [[Octave Gengou]], who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell pertussis [[vaccine]] began soon after ''B. pertussis'' was grown in pure culture in 1906. In the 1920s, Dr. [[Louis W. Sauer]] developed a vaccine for whooping cough at [[NorthShore University HealthSystem#Evanston Hospital|Evanston Hospital]] (Evanston, IL). In 1925, the Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell pertussis vaccine on a wide scale.<ref name=Baker_2004>{{cite journal |author=Baker JP, Katz SL |title=Childhood vaccine development: an overview |journal=Pediatr. Res. |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=347–56 |year=2004 |pmid=14630981 |doi=10.1203/01.PDR.0000106317.36875.6A}}</ref> 

He used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea. In 1942, the American scientist Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with [[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus]] toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component of the vaccine, the Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular pertussis vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leucocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by ''B. pertussis'' into the culture medium. Sato's acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan since 1981.<ref name=Sato_1984>{{cite journal |author=Sato Y, Kimura M, Fukumi H |title=Development of a pertussis component vaccine in Japan |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8369 |pages=122–6 |year=1984 |pmid=6140441 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(84)90061-8}}</ref> Later versions of the acellular pertussis vaccine used in other countries consisted of additional defined components of ''B. pertussis'' and were often part of the [[DTaP]] combination vaccine.

The complete ''B. pertussis'' [[genome]] of 4,086,186 base pairs was sequenced in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Parkhill J.

==Society and culture==
Much of the controversy surrounding the [[DPT vaccine]] in the 1970s and 1980s related to the question of whether the whole-cell pertussis component caused permanent brain injury in rare cases, called ''pertussis vaccine encephalopathy''. Despite this possibility, doctors recommended the vaccine due to the overwhelming public health benefit, because the claimed rate was very low (one case per 310,000 immunizations, or about 50 cases out of the 15 million immunizations each year in the United States), and the risk of death from the disease was high (pertussis killed thousands of Americans each year before the vaccine was introduced).<ref name=Huber />

No studies showed a causal connection, and later studies showed no connection of any type between administration of the DPT vaccine and permanent brain injury. The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage proved to be an unrelated condition, infantile [[epilepsy]].<ref>{{cite journal

To avert a vaccine crisis, Congress in 1986 passed the [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]] (NCVIA), which established a federal no-fault system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines.<ref name=Smith_1988>{{cite journal |author=Smith MH |title=National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act |journal=Pediatrics |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=264–9 |year=1988 |pmid=3399300}}</ref> The majority of claims that have been filed through the NCVIA have been related to injuries allegedly caused by the whole-cell DPT vaccine.

The concerns about side effects led Yuji Sato to introduce an even safer acellular version of the pertussis vaccine for Japan in 1981. The acellular pertussis vaccine was approved in the United States in 1992 for use in the combination DTaP vaccine. Research has shown that the acellular vaccine has a rate of adverse events similar to that of a Td vaccine (a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine containing no pertussis vaccine).<ref name="pmid15933223">{{cite journal |author=Pichichero ME, Rennels MB, Edwards KM, ''et al.'' |title=Combined tetanus, diphtheria, and 5-component pertussis vaccine for use in adolescents and adults |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=24 |pages=3003–11 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15933223 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.24.3003 }}</ref>
