'''Hormonal contraception''' refers to [[birth control]] methods that act on the [[endocrine system]].  Almost all methods are composed of [[steroid hormones]], although in [[India]] one [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] is marketed as a contraceptive.  The original hormonal method—the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]—was first marketed as a contraceptive in 1960.  In the ensuing decades many other delivery methods have been developed, although the oral and injectable methods are by far the most popular.  Altogether, 18% of the world's contraceptive users rely on hormonal methods.  Hormonal contraception is highly effective: when taken on the prescribed schedule, users of steroid hormone methods experience pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year. Perfect-use pregnancy rates for most hormonal contraceptives are usually around the 0.3% rate or less.<ref name="npsnews">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_news/current/hormonal_contraception_tailoring_for_the_individual |title=NPS News 54: Hormonal contraceptives - tailoring for the individual |author=National Prescribing Service |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2009}}</ref> Currently available methods can only be used by women; the development of a [[male hormonal contraceptive]] is an active research area.

There are two main types of hormonal contraceptive formulations: ''combined methods'' which contain both an [[estrogen]] and a [[progestin]], and ''progestogen-only methods'' which contain only [[progesterone]] or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins).  Combined methods work by suppressing [[ovulation]] and thickening [[cervical mucus]]; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus.  The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, [[breakthrough bleeding]] is much more common with progestogen-only methods.  Certain serious complications occasionally caused by estrogen-containing contraceptives are not believed to be caused by progestogen-only formulations: [[deep vein thrombosis]] is one example of this.

Combined contraceptives have also been made available in a variety of forms. In the 1960s a few [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s were introduced, notably Injectable Number 1 in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and Deladroxate in [[Latin America]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Research and regulatory approval (of injectable contraceptives) |journal=Population Reports |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=1995-08-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-17773564/research-and-regulatory-approval.html |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>  A third combined injection, Cyclo-Provera, was reformulated in the 1980s by lowering the dose and renamed Cyclofem (also called Lunelle).

In 1991, [[ormeloxifene]] was introduced as a contraceptive in [[India]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=MM |title=Centchroman, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, as a contraceptive and for the management of hormone-related clinical disorders |journal=Medical Research Reviews |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=302–47 |month=July |year=2001 |pmid=11410933 |doi=10.1002/med.1011}}</ref>  While it acts on the hormonal system, this [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] is not a hormone.

==Types==
There are two main classes of hormonal contraceptives: ''combined contraceptives'' contain both an estrogen (usually [[ethinyl estradiol]]) and a [[progestin]].  ''Progestogen-only contraceptives'' contain only [[progesterone]] or a synthetic analogue (progestin).  Also marketed is [[ormeloxifene]]; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy.

===Combined===
The most popular form of hormonal contraception, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is known colloquially as ''the pill''.  It is taken once a day, most commonly for 21 days followed by a seven-day break, although other regimens are also used.  For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, COCPs may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]: this is known as the [[Yuzpe regimen]].  COCPs are available in [[oral contraceptive formulations|a variety of formulations]].

The [[contraceptive patch]] is applied to the skin and worn continuously.  A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break.  [[NuvaRing]] is worn inside the vagina.  A ring is worn for three weeks.  After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring.  As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or NuvaRing to provide [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraception]].

A [[combined injectable contraceptive]] is a shot given once per month.

===Progestogen-only===
The [[progestogen only pill]] (POP) is taken once per day within the same three-hour window.  [[Oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen only pills|Several different formulations]] of POP are marketed.  A low-dose formulation is known as ''the minipill''.  Unlike COCPs, progestogen-only pills are taken every day with no breaks or placebos.  For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, progestogen-only pills may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]].  There are a number of [[Emergency contraceptive availability by country|dedicated products]] sold for this purpose.

Hormonal intrauterine contraceptives are known as [[intrauterine system]]s (IUS).  The only currently available brand is Mirena.  An IUS must be inserted by a health professional.  Mirena may be used for up to five years.  While a copper-containing [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) may be used as emergency contraception, the IUS has not been studied for this purpose.

[[Depo Provera]] is an injection that provides three months of contraceptive protection.  Noristerat is another injection; it is given every two months.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |title=Noristerat Injection |work=About.com |date=2009-07-28 |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/g/Noristerat.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>

Two types of progestogen-only contraceptive [[Implant (medicine)|implants]] are available. Both are inserted under the skin of the upper arm.  [[Jadelle]] (Norplant 2) consists of two rods that release a low dose of hormones.  It is effective for five years.  [[Implanon]] is a single rod that releases a moderate dose of hormones.  It is effective for three years.

===Ormeloxifene===
[[Ormeloxifene]] is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM).  Marketed as Centchroman, Centron, or Saheli, it is pill that is taken once per week. Ormeloxifene is legally available only in [[India]].<ref name="centron"/>

==Effectiveness==
Modern contraceptives using steroid hormones have ''perfect-use'' or ''method'' failure rates of less than 1% per year.  The lowest failure rates are seen with the implants Jadelle and Implanon, at 0.05% per year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sivin I, Campodonico I, Kiriwat O, ''et al.'' |title=The performance of levonorgestrel rod and Norplant contraceptive implants: a 5 year randomized study |journal=Hum.

==Mechanism of action==
The effect of hormonal agents on the reproductive system is complex. It is believed that combined hormonal contraceptives work primarily by preventing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus.  Progestogen-only contraceptives can also prevent ovulation, but rely more significantly on the thickening of cervical mucus. Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation, and its mechanism of action is not well understood.

===Combined===
Combined hormonal contraceptives were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. They inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.<ref name="Nelson 2011">{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.<br/>Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.</blockquote></ref><ref name="Speroff 2011">{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Oral contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=19–152|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}}</ref><ref name="Levin 2011">{{cite book|last1=Levin|first=Ellis R.|last2=Hammes|first2=Stephen R.|year=2011|chapter=Estrogens and progestins|editor1-last=Brunton|editor1-first-Laurence L.|editor2-last=Chabner|editor2-first=Bruce A.|editor3-last=Knollmann|editor3-first=Björn C.|title=Goodman & Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics|edition=12th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|pages=1163–1194|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8}}</ref><ref name="Glasier 2010">{{cite book|last=Glasier|first=Anna|year=2010|chapter=Contraception|editor1-last=Jameson|editor1-first=J.

Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.<ref name="Nelson 2011"/><ref name="Speroff 2011"/><ref name="Levin 2011"/>

Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.<ref name="Nelson 2011"/><ref name="Speroff 2011"/><ref name="Levin 2011"/>

Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].<ref name="Nelson 2011"/>

The estrogen and progestogen in combined hormonal contraceptives have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:<ref name="Nelson 2011"/>
* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].
* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].
* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.

Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.<ref name="Nelson 2011"/>

===Progestogen-only===
The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose.<ref name="Glasier 2010"/>

Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives include traditional progestogen-only pills, the subdermal implant [[Jadelle]] and the [[intrauterine system]] Mirena.  These contraceptives inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the [[cervical mucus]] and thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration.

Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant [[Implanon]]), allow some follicular development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with low dose progestogens.

High dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens.

In [[anovulation|anovulatory cycles]] using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).

===Ormeloxifene===
Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation.  It has been shown to increase the rate of [[blastocyst]] development and to increase the speed at which the blastocyst is moved from the [[fallopian tube]]s into the uterus.  Ormeloxifene also suppresses proliferation and decidualization of the [[endometrium]].<ref name="centron">{{cite web |title=Centchroman |work=Reproductive Health Online |year=2003 |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1advances/old/1centch/ceorvw.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>  While they are believed to prevent [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] rather than [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], exactly how these effects operate to prevent pregnancy is not understood.

==Prevalence==
Pills—combined and progestogen-only—are the most common form of hormonal contraception.  Worldwide, they account for 12% of contraceptive use. 21% of users of reversible contraceptives choose COCPs or POPs.  Pills are especially popular in more developed countries, where they account for 25% of contraceptive use.<!--

==Side-effects and potential risks==
===Effects on rates of cancers===
*There is a mixed effect of combined hormonal contraceptives on the rates of various cancers, with the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) concluding that "Combined oral contraceptives are carcinogenic to humans"<ref name=IARC99 /><ref name=IARC2007>{{Cite journal|publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]|work=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans
|volume=91|year=2007|title=Combined Estrogen-Progestogen Contraceptives|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]
|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol91/mono91-6.pdf}}</ref> and also saying that "there is also conclusive evidence that these agents have a protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium":<ref name=IARC99>{{cite book | author=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) | title=Oral Contraceptives, Combined | edition=Vol. 72 | year=1999 | chapter=5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation | chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-1.html | page=49}}</ref>
* The (IARC) note that "the weight of the evidence suggests a small increase in the relative risk for breast cancer among current and recent users" which following discontinuation then lessens over a period of 10 years to similar rates as women who never used them.
* Small increases are also seen in the rates of [[cervical cancer]] and [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular (liver) tumours]].
* [[Endometrial cancer|Endometrial]] and [[ovarian cancer]] risks are approximately halved and persists for at least 10 years after cessation of use; although "sequential oral contraceptives which were removed from the consumer market in the 1970s was associated with an increased risk for endometrial cancer".
* Studies have overall not shown effects on the relative risks for colorectal, malignant melanoma or thyroid cancers.
* Information on progesterone-only pills is less extensive, due to smaller sampling sizes, but they do not appear to significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.<ref name=iarc72>{{cite book |author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |title=Hormonal contraception and post-menopausal hormonal therapy; IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans, Volume 72 |year=1999 |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |isbn=92-832-1272-X |pages=339&ndash;397 |chapter=Hormonal contraceptives, progestogens only |chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-2.html}}</ref>
* Most other forms of hormonal contraception are too new for meaningful data to be available, although risks and benefits are believed to be similar for methods which use the same hormones; e.g., risks for combined-hormone patches are thought to be roughly equivalent to those for combined-hormone pills.<ref>{{cite web| accessdate=2007-07-13| url=http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/Handouts/orthoevra_patch.html| title=McKinley Health Center, University of Illinois: OrthoEvra Contraceptive Patch}}</ref>

===Risk of cardiovascular disease===
Combined oral contraceptives can increase the risk of certain types of cardiovascular disease in women with a pre-existing condition or already-heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. Smoking (for women over 35), metabolic conditions like diabetes, obesity and family history of heart disease are all risk factors which may be exacerbated by the use of certain hormonal contraceptives.<ref name="npsnews" />
