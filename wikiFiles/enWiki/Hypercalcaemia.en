'''Hypercalcaemia''' ([[British English]]) or '''hypercalcemia''' ([[American English]]) is an elevated [[calcium in biology|calcium]] level in the [[blood]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000050805|hypercalcemia}}</ref> (Normal range: 9–10.5&nbsp;mg/dL or 2.2–2.6&nbsp;mmol/L). It can be an asymptomatic laboratory finding, but because an elevated calcium level is often indicative of other diseases, a workup should be undertaken if it persists. It can be due to excessive skeletal calcium release, increased intestinal calcium absorption, or decreased renal calcium excretion.

==Signs and symptoms==
The neuromuscular symptoms of hypercalcemia are caused by a negative [[bathmotropic]] effect due to the increased interaction of calcium with [[sodium channel]]s. Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers, increased calcium raises the threshold for depolarization.<ref name=CMArmstrong1999>{{cite journal |author= Armstrong, C.M., Cota, Gabriel. |title=Calcium block of Na+ channels and its effect on closing rate |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=4154–4157 |year=1999 |pmid=PMC22436 |pmc=22436 |bibcode= 1999PNAS...96.4154A |last2= Cota |doi= 10.1073/pnas.96.7.4154}}</ref> There is a general mnemonic for remembering the effects of hypercalcaemia: "Stones, Bones, Groans, Thrones and Psychiatric Overtones"

* Stones (renal or biliary)
* Bones (bone pain)
* Groans (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting)
* Thrones (sit on throne - [[polyuria]])
* Psychiatric overtones (Depression 30-40%, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, insomnia, coma)
 
Other symptoms can include [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], and [[pancreatitis]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Abnormal [[cardiac arrhythmia|heart rhythms]] can result, and  [[ECG]] findings of a short [[QT interval]]<ref>http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/endocrinology/hypercalcemia/</ref> and a widened [[T wave]] suggest hypercalcaemia. Significant hypercalcaemia can cause ECG changes mimicking an acute [[myocardial infarction]].<ref>{{cite pmid|19435131}}</ref> Hypercalcaemia has also been known to cause an [[ECG]] finding mimicking hypothermia, known as an [[Osborn wave]].<ref>Serafi S, Vliek C, Taremi M (2011) "Osborn waves in a hypothermic patient" The Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives http://www.jchimp.net/index.php/jchimp/article/view/10742/html</ref>

Hypercalcaemia can increase [[gastrin]] production, leading to increased acidity so [[peptic ulcer]]s may also occur. 

Symptoms are more common at high calcium [[blood values]] (12.0&nbsp;mg/dL or 3&nbsp;mmol/l). Severe hypercalcaemia (above 15–16&nbsp;mg/dL or 3.75–4&nbsp;mmol/l) is considered a [[medical emergency]]: at these levels, [[coma]] and [[cardiac arrest]] can result. Medical staff will recognise that panic attacks and hyperventilation cause hypocalcaemia and irritable, hypersensitive nerves with muscle cramping and tingling sensations. Hypercalcaemia causes the opposite - the high levels of calcium ions decrease neuronal excitability, which leads to hypotonicity of smooth and striated muscle. This explains the fatigue, muscle weakness, low tone and sluggish reflexes in muscle groups. In the gut this causes constipation. The sluggish nerves also explain drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, stupor and / or coma.

==Causes==
[[Primary hyperparathyroidism]] and malignancy account for about 90% of cases of hypercalcaemia.<ref name=Kumar>Table 20-4 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref><ref name="isbn0-07-147247-9">{{cite book |author=Tierney, Lawrence M.; McPhee, Stephen J.; Papadakis, Maxine A. |title=Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2007 (Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2006 |pages=901 |isbn=0-07-147247-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Treatments==
The goal of therapy is to treat the hypercalcaemia first and subsequently effort is directed to treat the underlying cause.

===Initial therapy: fluids and diuretics===
*hydration, increasing salt intake, and [[forced diuresis]].
**hydration is needed because many patients are dehydrated due to vomiting or renal defects in concentrating urine.
**increased salt intake also can increase body fluid volume as well as increasing urine sodium excretion, which further increases urinary calcium excretion (In other words, calcium and sodium (salt) are handled in a similar way by the kidney. Anything that causes increased sodium (salt) excretion by the kidney will, ''en passant'', cause increased calcium excretion by the kidney)
**after rehydration, a [[loop diuretic]] such as [[furosemide]] can be given to permit continued large volume intravenous salt and water replacement while minimizing the risk of blood volume overload and  [[pulmonary edema|pulmonary oedema]]. In addition, [[loop diuretics]] tend to depress renal calcium reabsorption thereby helping to lower blood calcium levels
**can usually decrease serum calcium by 1–3&nbsp;mg/dL within 24 h
**caution must be taken to prevent [[Potassium#Medical_supplementation_and_disease|potassium]] or [[Magnesium deficiency (medicine)|magnesium]] depletion

===Additional therapy: bisphosphonates and calcitonin===
*[[bisphosphonates]] are [[pyrophosphate]] analogues with high affinity for bone, especially areas of high bone-turnover.
**they are taken up by [[osteoclast]]s and inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption
**current available drugs include (in order of potency): (1st gen) [[etidronate]], (2nd gen) [[tiludronate]], IV [[pamidronate]], [[alendronate]] (3rd gen) [[zoledronate]] and [[risedronate]]
**all patients with cancer-associated hypercalcaemia should receive treatment with [[bisphosphonates]] since the 'first line' therapy (above) cannot be continued indefinitely nor is it without risk. Further, even if the 'first line' therapy has been effective, it is a virtual certainty that the hypercalcaemia will recur in the patient with hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Use of bisphosphonates in such circumstances, then, becomes both therapeutic and preventative
**patients in [[renal failure]] and hypercalcaemia should have a risk-benefit analysis before being given [[bisphosphonates]], since they are relatively contraindicated in [[renal failure]].

*[[Calcitonin]] blocks bone resorption and also increases urinary calcium excretion by inhibiting renal calcium reabsorption
**Usually used in life-threatening hypercalcaemia along with rehydration, diuresis, and bisphosphonates
**Helps prevent recurrence of hypercalcaemia
**Dose is 4 Units per kg via subcutaneous or intramuscular route every 12 hours, usually not continued indefinitely

===Other therapies===
*rarely used, or used in special circumstances
**[[plicamycin]] inhibits bone resorption (rarely used)
**[[gallium nitrate]] inhibits bone resorption and changes structure of bone crystals (rarely used)
**[[glucocorticoids]] increase urinary calcium excretion and decrease intestinal calcium absorption
***no effect on calcium level in normal or primary hyperparathyroidism
***effective in hypercalcaemia due to osteolytic malignancies ([[multiple myeloma]], [[leukemia|leukaemia]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[breast cancer|carcinoma of the breast]]) due to antitumour properties
***also effective in [[hypervitaminosis D]] and [[sarcoidosis]]
**[[dialysis]] usually used in severe hypercalcaemia complicated by [[renal failure]]. Supplemental phosphate should be monitored and added if necessary
**[[phosphate]] therapy can correct the hypophosphataemia in the face of hypercalcaemia and lower serum calcium

==Hypercalcaemic crisis {{anchor|crisis}}==
A hypercalcaemic crisis is an emergency situation with a severe hypercalcaemia, generally above approximately 14&nbsp;mg/dL (or 3.5&nbsp;mmol/l).<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/766373-overview Hypercalcemia in Emergency Medicine] at Medscape. Author: Robin R Hemphill. Chief Editor: Erik D Schraga. Retrieved April 2011</ref> 

The main symptoms of a hypercalcaemic crisis are [[oliguria]] or [[anuria]], as well as [[somnolence]] or [[coma]].<ref name=Ziegler2001>{{cite journal |author=Ziegler R |title=Hypercalcemic crisis |journal=J.
