The '''white coat ceremony''' ('''WCC''') is a relatively new [[ritual]] in some [[medical]] (both [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]), [[optometry]], [[dentistry|dental]], [[chiropractic]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[podiatry|podiatric]], [[pharmacy]], [[physician assistant]], and [[veterinary medicine|veterinary medical]] schools that marks the [[student]]'s transition from the study of preclinical to clinical health sciences.  At some schools, where students begin meeting patients early in their education, the white coat ceremony is held before the first year begins. 

WCCs typically involve a formal "robing" or "cloaking" of students in [[white coat]]s, the garb [[physicians]] have traditionally worn for over 100 years<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones VA |title=The white coat: why not follow suit? |journal=JAMA |volume=281 |issue=5 |pages=478 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=9952213 |doi= 10.1001/jama.281.5.478|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9952213}}</ref> and other health professions have adopted.

==Description==
WCCs typically address the issue of [[medical ethics]] and praise rising students for their success in completing the basic science coursework of medicine, veterinary medicine, optometry, audiology, dentistry, chiropractic, podiatry, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant, advanced practice nursing ([[Nurse Practitioner]], [[Nurse anesthetist]], [[Clinical nurse specialist]], [[Nurse midwife]]).  A reading of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] is common, and family and friends are typically invited.  

Over 100 medical schools in the USA now have a WCC, and many students now consider it a [[rite of passage]] in the journey toward a healthcare career.  Some schools also use this as a graduation from the entire program as well. For example, [[Moreno Valley College]] has a White Coat Ceremony for the Physician Assistant students at the end of their final term, where the short coats are discarded and long coats are given as a symbol of being equal clinicians to others who have earned the long coats.

According to some{{who?|date=June 2012}}, WCCs have taken on a quasi-religious significance, that symbolizes a "conversion" of a [[lay person]] into a member of the healthcare profession<ref name=veatch>{{cite journal |author=Veatch RM |title=White coat ceremonies: a second opinion |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11834749 |doi= 10.1136/jme.28.1.5|url=http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11834749 |pmc=1733513}}</ref> and is similar to a priest's ordination to [[priesthood]].

==History==
[[File:WCC in Graz 2012.jpg|thumb|White Coat Ceremony in Graz (Austria) 2012]]

WCCs originated in [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] in 1989,<ref name="warren">Warren, Peter M. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/18/local/me-23619 For New Medical Students, White Coats Are a Warmup]" ''Los Angeles Times'', 18 October 1999.</ref> but the first full-fledged ceremony was at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].<ref name="warren"/>

Since starting in the US, several medical schools in countries outside of the [[USA]] (such as [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Brazil]] and [[Poland]]) have also started holding WCCs. The ceremony is no longer limited to medical students; starting in 1995, US pharmacy schools started holding WCCs, with the difference that most pharmacy students receive their coats at the end of their first academic year. In 2003 a survey found that the majority of US pharmacy schools hold WCCs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown DL, Ferrill MJ, Pankaskie MC |title=White coat ceremonies in US schools of pharmacy |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=1414–9 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14519030 |doi=10.1345/aph.1D124 |url=}}</ref>

In December of 2006 he first white coat ceremony was held by Fatima Jinnah Dental College (FJDC), in Karachi, [[Pakistan]].

On October 13, in 2010, the faculty of medicine at the University of Cologne, Germany, became the first German-speaking University to integrate this ritual into its programme. <ref name="cologne">"[http://www.fsmed-koeln.de/index.php?artikel=149 White Coat Ceremony, Fachschaft Medizin Köln]" White Coat Ceremony, Fachschaft Medizin Köln</ref>

On April 12, 2010, [http://www.uq.edu.au/pharmacy/index.html?page=133159 The University of Queensland's(Australia) School of Pharmacy] became the first in Australia to adopt the ceremony for its incoming Bachelor of Pharmacy students.

On February 28, 2011, the Faculty of Medicine at the [http://www.unipmn.it Università del Piemonte Orientale "Amedeo Avogadro"] in Novara became the first Italian medical school to introduce a white coat ceremony for its third year students. <ref> "Debutto per la Cerimonia del Camice Bianco, [http://www.pmnet.it/dett_news.asp?id=18080 NovaraOggi.com]" </ref>

On October 5, 2012, the Faculty of Medicine at the [[Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy|University of Medicine and Pharmacy "Gr. T. POPA" of Iasi]], [[Romania]], became the first Romanian university to integrate this ritual, for its first year medical students, into the symbolism of developing as a physician.

On October 8, 2012, the [[Medical University of Graz]] became the first university in Austria to celebrate a White Coat Ceremony of its third-year students.

On December 06, 2012, the School of Medicine at the All American Institute of Medical Sciences, Jamaica, became the first in Jamaica to introduce this ritual, for its Basic Sciences medical students.

==Criticism==
Some critics believe WCCs create a sense of entitlement to [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and respect that is unhealthy  and in turn may foster an elitism that separates patients from caregivers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Russell PC |title=The White Coat Ceremony: turning trust into entitlement |journal=Teach Learn Med |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=56–9 |year=2002 |pmid=11865752 |doi= 10.1207/S15328015TLM1401_13|url=}}</ref>
