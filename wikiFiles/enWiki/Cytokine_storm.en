A '''cytokine storm''', also known as '''cytokine cascade''' and '''hypercytokinemia''' is a potentially fatal immune reaction consisting of a [[positive feedback loop]] between [[cytokine]]s and [[immune cell]]s, with highly elevated levels of various cytokines.<ref name="osterholm">{{cite journal | last = Osterholm | first = Michael T. | author-link = Michael Osterholm |title = Preparing for the Next Pandemic | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 18 | pages = 1839–1842 | publisher = | date = 2005-05-05 | url = | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp058068 | id =  | pmid = 15872196 }}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The primary symptoms of a cytokine storm are high [[fever]], swelling and redness, extreme [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[nausea]]. In some cases the immune reaction may be fatal.

==Cause==

When the [[immune system]] is fighting [[pathogen]]s, cytokines signal immune cells such as [[T-cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s to travel to the site of infection.  In addition, cytokines activate those cells, stimulating them to produce more cytokines.<ref name="janeway">{{cite book | author = Murphy, K.; Travers, P.; Walport, M. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Janeway's Immunobiology. | edition = 7th  | language = | publisher = Garland | location = London | year = 2007 | origyear = | chapter = Signaling Through Immune System Receptors. | quote = | isbn = 0-8153-4123-7| oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Normally, this feedback loop is kept in check by the body.  However, in some instances, the reaction becomes uncontrolled, and too many immune cells are activated in a single place.  The precise reason for this is not entirely understood but may be caused by an exaggerated response when the immune system encounters a new and highly pathogenic invader.  Cytokine storms have potential to do significant damage to body tissues and organs. If a cytokine storm occurs in the [[lung]]s, for example, fluids and immune cells such as macrophages may accumulate and eventually block off the airways, potentially resulting in death.

The cytokine storm (hypercytokinemia) is the systemic expression of a healthy and vigorous immune system resulting in the release of more than 150 known [[inflammation|inflammatory]] mediators (cytokines, [[oxygen free radicals]], and [[coagulation factor]]s). Both pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]], [[Interleukin]]-1, and Interleukin-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as [[interleukin 10]] and [[interleukin 1 receptor antagonist]]) are elevated in the [[Serous fluid|serum]] of patients experiencing a cytokine storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Horst Ibelgaufts |url=http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=Systemic%20inflammatory%20response%20syndrome |title=COPE article about systemic inflammatory response |publisher=Copewithcytokines.de |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref>

Cytokine storms can occur in a number of infectious and non-infectious diseases including [[graft versus host disease]] (GVHD), [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), [[sepsis]], [[avian influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS).<ref name="goldman">{{cite book | author = Drazen, Jeffrey M.; Cecil, Russell L.; Goldman, Lee; Bennett, J.

== Role in pandemic deaths ==

It is believed that cytokine storms were responsible for many of the deaths during the [[Spanish flu|1918 influenza pandemic]], which killed a disproportionate number of young adults.<ref name="osterholm"/>  In this case, a healthy immune system may have been a liability rather than an asset. Preliminary research results from [[Hong Kong]] also indicated this as the probable reason for many deaths during the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemic in 2003.<ref name="pmid15602737">{{cite journal | author = Huang KJ, Su IJ, Theron M, Wu YC, Lai SK, Liu CC, Lei HY | title = An interferon-gamma-related cytokine storm in SARS patients | journal = Journal of Medical Virology | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–94 | year = 2005 | month = February | pmid = 15602737 | doi = 10.1002/jmv.20255 | url =  }}</ref> Human deaths from the bird flu [[H5N1]] usually involve cytokine storms as well.<ref name="pmid18258000">{{cite journal | author = Haque A, Hober D, Kasper LH | title = Confronting Potential Influenza A (H5N1) Pandemic with Better Vaccines | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1512–8 | year = 2007 | month = October | pmid = 18258000 | doi = 10.3201/eid1310.061262| url = http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/13/10/1512.htm| pmc = 2851514 }}</ref> Recent reports of high mortality among healthy young adults in the [[2009 H1N1 flu outbreak|2009 swine flu outbreak]] has led to speculation that cytokine storms could be responsible for these deaths, this speculation is understandable seeing as how the Swine Flu results from the same influenza strain as the Spanish Flu of 1918.<ref name="urlFighting Deadly Flu, Mexico Shuts Schools - NYTimes.com">{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/world/americas/25mexico.html | title = Fighting Deadly Flu, Mexico Shuts Schools  | author = Lacey M McNeil DG Jr | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2009-04-24 | work = | publisher = NYTimes.com | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-04-29}}</ref> However, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) have indicated that symptoms reported from this strain so far are similar to those of normal seasonal flu,<ref name="CDCidentification">{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/identifyingpatients.htm | title = Interim Guidance for Clinicians on Identifying and Caring for Patients with Swine-origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2009-04-29 | work = | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-04-29}}</ref> with the CDC stating that there is "insufficient information to date about clinical complications of this variant of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection."<ref name=CDCidentification/> Cytokine storm has also been implicated in [[Hantavirus|hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9878011 |title=High levels of cytokine-producing cells in the ...

== Treatment ==
=== OX40 IG ===

A 2003 report in the ''Journal of Experimental Medicine'' published by researchers at [[Imperial College London]] demonstrates<ref name="ImpCol">{{cite journal | last = Humphreys | first = IR | coauthors = G Walzl, L Edwards, A Rae, S Hill, T Hussell | title = A Critical Role for OX40 in T Cell–mediated Immunopathology during Lung Viral Infection | journal = J Exp Med. | volume = 198 | issue = 8 | pages = 1237–1242 | publisher = | date = 2003-10-20 | url = | pmc = 2194232 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20030351 | pmid = 14568982 }}</ref> the possibility of preventing a cytokine storm by inhibiting or disabling [[T-cell]] response.  A few days after T cells are activated, they produce a  molecule called [[OX40]] (also known as [[CD134]]), a "survival signal" that keeps activated T-cells working at the site of inflammation during infection with influenza or other pathogens.  OX40 binds to receptors on T-cells, preventing them from dying and subsequently increasing cytokine production.  A combined protein, OX40-[[immunoglobulin]] (OX40-Ig), a human-made [[fusion protein]], prevents OX40 from reaching the T-cell receptors, thus reducing the T-cell response.  Experiments in mice have demonstrated that OX40-Ig can reduce the symptoms associated with an immune overreaction while allowing the immune system to fight off the virus successfully. By blocking the OX40 receptor on T-cells, researchers were able to prevent the development of the most serious flu symptoms in these experimental mice.<ref name="ImpCol" /> These results were the subject of an article in the science magazine ''[[New Scientist]]''.<ref name="urlNew flu drug calms the storm ">{{cite web | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4293 | title = New flu drug calms the 'storm'  | author = Bhattacharya S | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2003-10-20 | work = | publisher = New Scientist | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-04-29}}</ref> The drug, to be made by a company called Xenova Research (Xenova Research was purchased by Celtic Pharma, a private equity firm, in September 2005), was supposed to be in phase I clinical trial in 2004, but its status is currently unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search;jsessionid=32E2FC88152AAF2035034EDFE4048F58?term=OX-40&submit=Search |title=OX-40 Clinical Trial details |publisher=Clinicaltrials.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref>

In addition, preliminary data has shown that simvastatin induced down-regulation of OX40 and OX40L mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner, and antagonized the interferon-gamma-induced increase in OX40 and OX40L mRNA and protein levels.  Further, serum levels of soluble OX40L and matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels were significantly reduced in patients with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction who were treated for 6 months with routine therapy plus simvastatin (n = 46) compared with patients receiving routine therapy alone (n = 30).<ref>Liu B. et al.

=== ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers ===

The Renin Angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the mediation of the cytokine storm,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Genctoy | first = G | title = TNF alpha-308 genotype and renin-angiotensin system in hemodialysis patients: an effect on inflammatory cytokine levels? | journal = Artif Organs | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–178 | publisher = | month = February | year = 2005 | url = | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2005.29029.x | pmid = 15670287 | author-separator = , | author2 = B Altun | display-authors = 1 | last3 = Alper Kiykim | first3 = Ahmet | last4 = Arici | first4 = Mustafa | last5 = Erdem | first5 = Yunus | last6 = Caglar | first6 = Meltem | last7 = Yasavul | first7 = Unal | last8 = Turgan | first8 = Cetin | last9 = Caglar | first9 = Sali }}</ref> suggesting a potential benefit for [[ACE inhibitor|Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors]] and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), and ACE has been implicated in inflammatory lung pathologies.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Moldobaeva | first = A | coauthors = EM Wagner | title = Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in ovine bronchial vasculature | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 2278–2284 | publisher = Department of Medicine,  Johns Hopkins University | month = December | year = 2003 | url = | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00266.2003 | pmid = 12897028 | doi_brokendate = 2009-04-29 }}</ref> Shigehara ''et al.'' published research confirming that serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a useful marker for disease activity in cytokine-mediated inflammatory lung disease.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Shigehara | first = K  | title = Increased circulating interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40 in pulmonary sarcoidosis | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 132 | issue = 1 | pages = 152–157 | publisher = Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine | month = April | year = 2003 | url = | pmc = 1808667 | pmid = 12653850  | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2003.02105.x | author-separator = , | author2 = N Shijubo | display-authors = 1 | last3 = Ohmichi | first3 = M. | last4 = Kamiguchi | first4 = K. | last5 = Takahashi | first5 = R. | last6 = Morita-Ichimura | first6 = S. | last7 = Ohchi | first7 = T. | last8 = Tatsuno | first8 = T. | last9 = Hiraga | first9 = Y. }}</ref> Marshall and co-workers also found that angiotensin II was associated with cytokine-mediated lung injury<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marshall | first = RP | title = Angiotensin II and the fibroproliferative response to acute lung injury | journal = Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol | volume = 286  | issue = 1 | pages = 156–164 | publisher = Royal Free and University College London Medical School | month = January | year = 2004 | url = | pmid = 12754187 | doi = 10.1152/ajplung.00313.2002 | author-separator = , | author2 = P Gohlke | display-authors = 1 | last3 = Chambers | first3 = RC | last4 = Howell | first4 = DC | last5 = Bottoms | first5 = SE | last6 = Unger | first6 = T | last7 = McAnulty | first7 = RJ | last8 = Laurent | first8 = GJ }}</ref> and suggested a role for ACE inhibitors.

Wang and co-workers published data that cytokine-mediated pulmonary damage (apoptosis of lung [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]]) in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (implicated in the cytokine storm) requires the presence of angiotensin II, suggesting that ARBs might have clinical utility in this setting.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wang | first = R | title = Apoptosis of lung epithelial cells in response to TNF-alpha requires angiotensin II generation de novo | journal = J Cell Physiol | volume = 185 | issue = 2 | pages = 253–259 | publisher = The Cardiovascular Institute, Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center | month = November | year = 2000 | url = | pmid = 11025447 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4652(200011)185:2<253::AID-JCP10>3.0.CO;2-# | author-separator = , | author2 = G Alam | display-authors = 1 | last3 = Zagariya | first3 = Alex | last4 = Gidea | first4 = Claudia | last5 = Pinillos | first5 = Hugo | last6 = Lalude | first6 = Omosalewa | last7 = Choudhary | first7 = Gaurav | last8 = Oezatalay | first8 = Devlet | last9 = Uhal | first9 = Bruce D. }}</ref>

Das published a review of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-II receptor blocker use in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies and suggested that ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor blockers have theoretical benefit in downregulation of the cytokine storm.<ref name="pmid16124358">{{cite journal | author = Das UN | title = Angiotensin-II behaves as an endogenous pro-inflammatory molecule | journal = The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 472–6 | year = 2005 | month = May | pmid = 16124358 | doi = | url =  }}</ref>

=== Corticosteroids ===

Although frequently employed to treat patients experiencing the cytokine storm associated with [[ARDS]], [[corticosteroids]] and [[NSAID]]s have been evaluated in [[clinical trials]] and have shown no effect on lung mechanics, gas exchange, or beneficial outcome in early established ARDS.<ref name="goldman"/>

===Gemfibrozil===
Preliminary data has shown that [[gemfibrozil]], an agent that inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines in addition to its clinically useful lipid-lowering activity, increased survival in BALB/c mice that were already ill from infection by influenza virus A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2). Gemfibrozil was administered [[intraperitoneally]] once daily from days 4 to 10 after intranasal exposure to the virus. Survival increased from 26% in vehicle-treated mice (n = 50) to 52% in mice given gemfibrozil at 60&nbsp;mg/kg/day (n = 46) (P = 0.0026). If this principle translates to patients, a drug already approved for human use, albeit by a different route for another purpose, might be adapted relatively fast for use against influenza, conceivably including human infection with a derivative of the avian H5N1 strain.<ref>Budd A, Alleva L, Alsharifi M, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Aug;51(8):2965-8. Epub 2007 Jun 11 PMID 17562808</ref>

=== Free radical scavengers ===

Preliminary data from [[clinical trials]] involving patients with [[sepsis]]-induced [[ARDS]] have shown a reduction in organ damage and a trend toward improvement in survival (survival in ARDS is approximately 60%) after administering or upregulating a variety of [[free radical scavengers]] (antioxidants).<ref name="goldman"/>

=== TNF-alpha blockers ===

Some types of [[arthritis]] medications are designed to reduce [[inflammation]] by inhibiting the [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] pathway to immune cell activation; these drugs are known as TNF-alpha blockers.  One study<ref name="pmid17965123">{{cite journal | author = Gelinck LB, van der Bijl AE, Beyer WE, Visser LG, Huizinga TW, van Hogezand RA, Rimmelzwaan GF, Kroon FP | title = The effect of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment on the antibody response to influenza vaccination | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 713–6 | year = 2008 | month = May | pmid = 17965123 | doi = 10.1136/ard.2007.077552 | url =  }}</ref> found that three different TNF-alpha blockers afforded a slight reduction in antibody presentation after vaccination against influenza in a group of immunocompromised patients, however it did not significantly affect patients' protective factor gained from inoculation.  More research is necessary before any conclusions may be made regarding the efficacy of TNF-alpha blockers at reducing the effects of a cytokine storm in hospitalized flu patients.
