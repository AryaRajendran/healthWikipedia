'''Exophthalmometer''' is an instrument used for measuring the degree of forward displacement of the eye in [[exophthalmos]]. The device allows measurement of the forward distance of the lateral [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rim to the front of the cornea. 
<ref>{{cite web|title=Exophthalmometer in TheFreeDictionary|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/exophthalmometer|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> Exophthalmometers can also identify [[enophthalmos]] (retraction of the eye into the orbit), a sign of [[blowout fracture|blow-out fracture]] or certain neoplasms.

== Methods ==
There are several types of exophthalmometers, Hertel and Luedde measure the distance of the corneal apex from the level of the lateral orbital rim while Naugle measures the relative difference between each eye:<ref name=ono>{{cite book|last=Onofrey|first=Bruce E.|title=Ocular therapeutics handbook : a clinical manual|publisher=Wolters Kluwer /Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=1605479527|pages=71–72|edition=Third Edition.|coauthors=Leonid Skorin, Jr., Nicky R. Holdeman}}</ref>

* Hertel exophthalmometer: measurement is taken from the lateral orbital rim to the [[cornea|corneal apex]].  If a patient presents with an orbital fracture or after lateral orbitotomy, the use of Hertel exophthalmometer may be complicated because the lateral orbital rim serves as a reference point for this instrument. Consideration should be given to the use of the Naugle exophthalmometer in these cases.
* Naugle exophthalmometer uses fixation points slightly above and below the superior and inferior orbital rims (cheek bones and forehead). Naugle exophthalmometer measures the difference in [[exophthalmos|proptosis]] between the two eyes rather than absolute measure with the Hertel method.
* Luedde exophthalmometer fixes on lateral orbital wall and uses a transparent ruler to measure the amount of protrusion.

== Normal values ==
The normal range is 12–21&nbsp;mm. Upper normal limit for blacks is a little higher, about 23–24&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=de Juan E|first=Jr|coauthors=Hurley, DP; Sapira, JD|title=Racial differences in normal values of proptosis.|journal=Archives of internal medicine|date=1980 Sep|volume=140|issue=9|pages=1230–1|pmid=7406621}}</ref>   

A difference greater than 2&nbsp;mm between the eyes is significant.

In children and teenagers mean exophthalmometric measurements increase with age: Less than 4 years old (13.2&nbsp;mm), 5–8 years old (14.4mm), 9–12 years old (15.2&nbsp;mm) and 13–17 years old (16.2&nbsp;mm).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dijkstal|first=JM|coauthors=Bothun, ED; Harrison, AR; Lee, MS|title=Normal exophthalmometry measurements in a United States pediatric population.|journal=Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=2012 Jan|volume=28|issue=1|pages=54–6|pmid=22262290}}</ref>

Axial Length of the eye affects exophthalmometer reading. Pseudoproptosis may be seen in severe [[myopia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen M, Zhou XT, Xue AQ, Wang QM, Sheng W, Yuan YM, Qu J.|title=Myopic proptosis and the associated changes in axial components of the eye|journal=Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi|year=2007|month=Jun|volume=43|issue=6|pages=525–9|pmid=17897530}}</ref>
