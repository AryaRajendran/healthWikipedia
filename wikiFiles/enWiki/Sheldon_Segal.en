'''Sheldon Jerome Segal''' (March 15, 1926 &ndash; October 17, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[embryologist]] and [[biochemist]] who spent his entire career working on [[contraception]] and made major innovations in the field of long-lasting alternatives, including in the creation of [[Norplant]], the first major development advance in birth control since the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]].

==Early life and education==
Segal was born on March 15, 1926, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], where he attended [[Erasmus Hall High School]]. He enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II when he was 16-years old. He was assigned to a troop transport that was to have been sent for the land invasion of Japan. When the war ended with the atomic bombing of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], obviating the need for naval landings, he was sent to participate in nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]]. He left the Navy with the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]]. After completing his military service, Segal earned a bachelor's degree at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1947 and was awarded his doctorate degree from the [[University of Iowa]] in 1947 in biochemistry and embryology.<ref name=NYTObit>Grimes, William.

==Contraception career==
The [[Population Council]] hired him in 1956 as assistant medical director for its biomedical research laboratories and he was named as director in 1963.<ref name=NYTObit/> Following a visit to [[India]] in the 1960s in which he helped establish a model for women's clinics for family planning that would offer contraceptives and prenatal care, Segal came to the conclusion that his career goal should be "to develop practical advances for women's health".<ref name=WSJObit/>

He established the [[International Committee for Contraception Research]] in 1970 to help provide information regarding the development new contraceptives worldwide. He joined the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in 1978 as the organization's first director of the division of population sciences. He was rehired by the Population Council in 1991, where he developed [[intrauterine device]]s based on copper and [[vaginal ring]]s.<ref name=NYTObit/>

Segal's best-known work was the creation of [[Norplant]], introduced in 1991 as a contraceptive device that could be inserted under the skin, with its silicone rods releasing [[progestin]] for as long as five years. While it offered the benefit of never having to remember to take a pill, side effects included bleeding, hair loss and weight gain.<ref name=NYTObit/> After cases occurred where judges ordered the implant of the device to prevent pregnancy and in the wake of editorials advocating its use "as a way of reducing the welfare burden resulting from high fertility among the underclass", Segal wrote a strongly worded letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in January 1991, indicating that he was "totally and unalterably opposed to the use of Norplant for any coercive or involuntary purpose" and would lead the opposition to use "Norplant for coercive sterilization or birth control".<ref>Segal, Sheldon J.

Accessed October 22, 2009.</ref> [[Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories]] withdrew the product in 2002 after court cases that argued that a number of major side effects had not been properly disclosed.<ref name=WashPostObit/>

In 2003, his intrauterine device [[Mirena]], which uses a progestin to thicken cervical mucus to prevent pregnancy was introduced 
by [[Berlex Laboratories]].<ref name=NYTObit/>

Over the years, he helped convince that the Chinese government to use more flexible copper-based IUDs, which led to a reduction in the number of abortions necessitated by the use of one-size-fits all steel IUDs.<ref name=WashPostObit/>

He was the author of more than 300 works, including the 1999 book ''Is Menstruation Obsolete?'' which he co-wrote with [[Elsimar M. Coutinho]], which argued that there is no health benefit from monthly menstruation.<ref name=WashPostObit>Sullivan, Patricia.

Accessed October 22, 2009.</ref> The book stated that early women would menstruate very infrequently because of frequent pregnancies, child nursing and physical demands and that the side effects of the "incessant ovulation" that modern women experience could include [[anemia]] and [[endometriosis]].<ref name=WSJObit>Miller, Stephen.

Accessed October 22, 2009.</ref>

==Personal life and death==
He was married to novelist [[Harriet Feinberg]]. The couple had three daughters.<ref name=NYTObit/>

A resident of [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], Segal died at his home there at age 83 on October 17, 2009, because of [[congestive heart failure]].
