'''PulseNet''' is a network run by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) which brings together [[public health]] and food regulatory agency laboratories around the [[United States]].<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/ CDC PulseNet USA Website</ref> Through the network, cooperating groups can share [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE) results which act as [[genetic fingerprinting|fingerprints]] to distinguish strains of organisms such as ''[[E. coli]]'' (O157:H7 and non O157), [[Salmonella]], [[Shigella]], [[Listeria]], [[Campylobacter]], [[Vibrio cholerae]], [[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]] and [[Yersinia pestis]]. In this way, efforts to combat [[infectious disease]] [[outbreak]]s are strengthened. Specifically, by sharing results, it is easier to identify large scale outbreaks. For example, if an outbreak of ''E. coli'' occurred in two distant parts of the country, PulseNet might help prove a link between the two. In such a case, the [[pathogen]] would have the same genetic fingerprint at both locations.

Due to the success of '''Pulsenet''' USA since its inception in 1996, similar networks have been established internationally in Canada (2000), the Asia Pacific (2002), Europe (2003),<ref>http://www.pulsenet-europe.org/ PulseNet Europe Website</ref> Latin America (2003),<ref>http://www.panalimentos.org/pulsenet/ PulseNet Latin America Website</ref> and the Middle East (2006). These networks collaborate under the umbrella of PulseNet International.<ref>http://www.pulsenetinternational.org PulseNet International Website</ref> PulseNet participants use the [[BioNumerics]] software suite for database maintenance, tiff image normalization, and analysis and pattern comparisons.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hunter SB, Vauterin P, Lambert-Fair MA, Van Duyne MS, Kubota K, Graves L, Wrigley D, Barrett T, Ribot E.| title= [http://jcm.asm.org/content/43/3/1045.long Establishment of a universal size standard strain for use with the PulseNet standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocols: converting the national databases to the new size standard.]  |journal= J.

The objectives of PulseNet International are to perform molecular surveillance of [[foodborne]] diseases at the global level in order to facilitate international [[outbreak]] detection and investigation by partnering with public health laboratories throughout the world and by building capacity for molecular [[surveillance]] of foodborne [[pathogens]].

Additionally, the participants collaborate on the development, validation and implementation of internationally standardized subtyping methods to be used in the networks and perform collaborative studies on the geographic distribution and spread of different clones of foodborne [[pathogens]].
