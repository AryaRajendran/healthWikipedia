The '''pons''' ({{IPA-en|ˈpɔnz|pron}}) is a structure located on the [[brain stem]], named after the Latin word for "bridge" or the 16th-century Italian anatomist and surgeon [[Costanzo Varolio]] (pons Varolii).<ref name="Gray1862">{{cite book|author=Henry Gray|title=Anatomy, descriptive and surgical|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=btSyie_UtxAC&pg=PA514|accessdate=10 November 2010|year=1862|publisher=Blanchard and Lea|pages=514–}}</ref> It is [[Anatomical terms of location|cranial]] to the [[medulla oblongata]], [[caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] to the [[midbrain]], and [[ventral]] to the [[cerebellum]]. In [[human]]s and other [[biped]]s, this means it is above the medulla, below the midbrain, and [[anterior]] to the cerebellum. This [[white matter]] includes tracts that conduct signals from the [[cerebrum]] down to the cerebellum and medulla, and tracts that carry the sensory signals up into the [[thalamus]].<ref name="Saladin Kenneth S.2007">Saladin Kenneth S.(2007)</ref>

The pons in humans measures about 2.5&nbsp;cm or 1 inch in length. Most of it appears as a broad anterior bulge [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Other_directional_terms|rostral]] to the medulla. Posteriorly, it consists mainly of two pairs of thick stalks called [[Superior cerebellar peduncle|cerebellar peduncle]]s. They connect the cerebellum to the pons and midbrain.<ref name="Saladin Kenneth S.2007" />

The pons contains [[Nucleus_(neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] that relay signals from the forebrain to the cerebellum, along with nuclei that deal primarily with sleep, respiration, swallowing, bladder control, hearing, equilibrium, taste, eye movement, facial expressions, facial sensation, and posture.<ref name="Saladin Kenneth S.2007"/>

Within the pons is the [[pneumotaxic center]], a nucleus in the pons that regulates the change from inspiration to expiration.<ref name="Saladin Kenneth S.2007"/>

The pons is implicated in sleep paralysis, and also plays a role in generating dreams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Embryonic development==
During embryonic development, the embryonic metencephalon develops from the [[rhombencephalon]] and gives rise to two structures: the pons and the cerebellum.<ref name="Saladin Kenneth S.2007"/> The [[alar plate]] produces sensory [[neuroblast]]s, which will give rise to the [[solitary nucleus]] and its [[special visceral afferent]] (SVA) column, the [[Cochlear nuclei|cochlear]] and [[vestibular nuclei]]—which form the [[special somatic afferent]] (SSA) fibers of the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]—, the spinal and principal [[trigeminal nerve nuclei]]—which form the [[General somatic afferent fibers|general somatic afferent column]] (GSA) of the [[trigeminal nerve]]—, and the [[pontine nuclei]] which relays to the [[cerebellum]].

[[Basal plate (neural tube)|Basal plate]] neuroblasts give rise to the [[abducent nucleus]]—which forms the [[general somatic efferent fibers]] (GSE)—, the facial and motor trigeminal nuclei—which form the [[special visceral efferent]] (SVE) column—, and the [[superior salivatory nucleus]], which forms the [[general visceral efferent fibers]] of the [[facial nerve]].

==Cranial nerve nuclei==
A number of [[cranial nerve]] nuclei are present in the pons:
* mid-pons: the 'chief' or 'pontine' nucleus of the [[trigeminal nerve]] sensory nucleus (V)
* mid-pons: the [[motor nucleus for the trigeminal nerve]] (V)
* lower down in the pons: [[abducens nucleus]] (VI)
* lower down in the pons: [[facial nerve nucleus]] (VII)
* lower down in the pons: [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|vestibulocochlear]] nuclei ([[vestibular nuclei]] and [[cochlear nuclei]]) (VIII)

The functions of these four nerves include sensory roles in hearing, equilibrium, and taste, and in facial sensations such as touch and pain, as well as motor roles in eye movement, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing, and the secretion of saliva and tears.<ref name="Saladin Kenneth S.2007"/>

==Related diseases==
* [[Central pontine myelinosis]] is a [[demyelination]] disease that causes difficulty with sense of balance, walking, sense of touch, swallowing and speaking. In a clinical setting, it is often associated with transplant. Undiagnosed, it can lead to death or [[locked-in syndrome]].

==Evolution==

The pons first evolved as an offshoot of the medullary [[reticular formation]].<ref name=Pritchard>[[#refPritchard|Pritchard and Alloway ''Medical Neuroscience'']]</ref> Since lampreys possess a pons, it has been argued that it must have evolved as a region distinct from the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] by the time the first [[agnathans]] appeared, 505 million years ago.<ref name=Butler>[[#refButler|Butler and Hodos ''Comparative vertebrate neuroanatomy: evolution and adaptation'']]</ref>
