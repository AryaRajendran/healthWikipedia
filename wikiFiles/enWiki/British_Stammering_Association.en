'''The British Stammering Association''' ('''BSA'''), a [[charitable organization|charity]] since 1978, is a national membership organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] for adults and children who [[Stuttering|stammer]], their friends and families, [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech and language therapists]] and other professionals. Based in [[London]], it is run by people who stammer. BSA promotes awareness of stammering, offers advice, information and support to all whose lives are affected by stammering, initiates and supports research into stammering and identifies and promotes effective [[therapy|therapies]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stammering.org/about_bsa.html|title= About the British Stammering Association|publisher= British Stammering Association|accessdate= 13 April 2012}}</ref> It describes stammering as a [[neurological]] issue<ref name="MPs">{{cite news | url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/12/07/comment-stammering-mps-are-better-than-glib-ones?fb_action_ids=10151355170419882&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_ref=facebook_referrals&fb_source=timeline_og&action_object_map={%2210151355170419882%22:414496271956581}&action_type_map={%2210151355170419882%22:%22og.likes%22}&action_ref_map={%2210151355170419882%22:%22facebook_referrals%22} | title=Comment: Stammering MPs are better than glib ones | work=politics.co.uk | date=7 December 2012 | accessdate=8 December 2012 | author=Norbert Lieckfeldt}}</ref>and estimates that about 700,000 people in the UK have a stammer.<ref name="MPs"/>

===Patrons===
In September 2010, the Association announced that Labour front-bench politician [[Ed Balls]], who is now [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], had become a [[Patronage#Charity|patron]] of the Association.

===Scotland===
The Association's Scottish branch, BSA Scotland, was founded in 2004 as a focus for Scottish campaigns, events and support services as well as to engage with 
the [[Scottish Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/equal/inquiries/disability/evidence/DI023%20British%20Stammering%20Associaiton%20Scotland.pdf|title=‘Shout it to the top!’:People who stammer find their voices in the Scottish Parliament|publisher= BSA Scotland|date= July 2005|accessdate= 5 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stammering.org/scotland/news_launch.html|title=BSA Scotland launch - December 2004|publisher= BSA Scotland|accessdate= 6 August 2012}}</ref>

==Advice, information and support==
The Association operates a helpline[http://www.stammering.org/helpline.html/] and offers information packs for parents of children under 5, primary and secondary school children, teenagers, adults who stammer, speech and language therapists, teachers and employers. It can also signpost callers to their local [[National Health Service|NHS]] Speech and Language Therapy Service.

==Research and publications==

Between 2004 and 2005 the Association published a [[research journal]], ''Stammering Research'',[http://www.stamres.psychol.ucl.ac.uk] which was edited by Professor Peter Howell of [[University College London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/chc/dev/people/peter-howell|title=Prof Peter Howell: personal profile | year=2011 |publisher=[[University College London]]|accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>

In 2010 the Association produced research showing that children with signs of stammering are more likely to overcome the problem if they receive help before they reach school age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-131293/Brain-disorder-key-stammer.html|title=Brain disorder is key to a stammer |publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>

To increase understanding in schools of stammering, the Association has produced an online resource [http://www.stammeringineducation.net/] for all teachers and school support staff in England and Scotland. It includes guidance on how to identify children who stammer and strategies on how to support them in both [[primary schools|primary]] and secondary schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jan/17/kings-speech-stammerers-services-cut |title=The King's Speech means stammerers understood |author=Alison Whyte|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref>

The Association publishes a quarterly magazine, ''Speaking Out''.<ref name = "Speaking Out"/> Most of the articles also go on the Association's website, normally after a few months' delay. The spring 2011 issue included an article in which BSA member Richard Oerton recalled his own experiences with [[King George VI]]'s speech therapist [[Lionel Logue]] who is featured in the film ''[[The King's Speech]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://stammering.org/logue.html|title=Remembering Lionel Logue| author= Richard Oerton| journal=Speaking Out |publisher=British Stammering Association|date=Spring 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> An interview with Neil Swain, voice coach for the film, was published in the summer 2011 issue.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://stammering.org/neilswain.html|title=The King's Voice| journal=Speaking Out|publisher= British Stammering Association|date=Summer 2011 |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> The spring/summer 2012 issue included an interview with the actor [[Charles Edwards (English actor)|Charles Edwards]], who played George VI in the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage version of the film.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.stammering.org/kingsspeechonstage.html|title=The King's Speech on stage| journal=Speaking Out|publisher= British Stammering Association|date=Spring/Summer 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref>

From 2005 to 2009, BSA Scotland produced a twice yearly newsletter, ''Blether''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stammering.org/scotland/blether.html|title= Blether, the BSA Scotland newsletter (archive)|publisher= BSA Scotland|accessdate= 6 August 2012}}</ref>

The Association produces information leaflets, some of which are available in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stammering.org/where_wales.html|title= Wales |publisher= British Stammering Association|accessdate= 6 August 2012}}</ref>

== Campaigns ==
The Association has campaigned for several years to eradicate misleading [[advertising]] claims made by stammering treatment providers. Some claim, for example, that they can "[[cure]]" stammering − but it is not possible to "cure" a stammer, in the accepted medical sense of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stammering.org/cure.html|title=Is there a cure for stammering?
 |publisher=British Stammering Association|date=April 2006|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> Accordingly, the BSA believes such claims not only give false hope to those who stammer − but also give people who don't stammer the false impression that stammering can easily be rectified. Respectable healthcare companies carry out independent trials on large numbers of people, over long periods of time, before claiming any benefit for their products or services.  The campaign has been conducted by, firstly, encouraging treatment providers who are making doubtful claims to provide supporting data and, if they cannot do so, to moderate those claims; and, secondly, in cases where the treatment provider has not co-operated, the Association has reported their advertisements to the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA), who have investigated the claims and, if they prove to be unsupportable, have instructed them to remove the offending advertisement and amend any future claims.  As from 1 March 2011, the  ASA, and thus the Association, have also been able to act against misleading claims made in editorial copy on websites.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://stammering.org/claims.html|title=Misleading treatment claims|author= Leys Geddes|journal=Speaking Out|publisher= British Stammering Association|date=March 2011, updated May 2011 and July 2011|accessdate = 13 July 2011}}</ref> Following a complaint by the Association, on 13 July 2011 the Advertising Standards Authority issued an adjudication against a website which said: "Discover how to stop stuttering with stammering cure that works..."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2011/7/Stammering-Cure/TF_ADJ_51096.aspx |title= ASA Adjudication on Stammering Cure |publisher= [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] |date= 13 July 2011 |accessdate = 13 July 2011}}</ref>

BSA's Chief Executive Norbert Lieckfeldt, who describes stammering as "the hidden disability",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jan/09/stammering-the-kings-speech| title= Stammering: lost for words| author=Keith Austin| journal= [[The Guardian]]| date= 9 January 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> said the charity had received calls from members who said people were asking them about their stammer for the first time, because of ''The King's Speech''. The film had created a "good opportunity" for people to talk about stammering. He said: “Suddenly it has become a thing that can be talked about, which is very important for us...For those people who are engaged in conversations about it, their situation will have changed for the better.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutaccess.co.uk/article.php?id=181| title= The King’s Speech is ‘squashing urban myths about stammering’|publisher= About Access| date= 2 March 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9358000/9358990.stm| title= Reading is centre of excellence in stammering treatment|author= Emma Midgley |publisher= [[BBC Berkshire]]| date= 12 January 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref> 
However, the Association criticised comedian [[Lenny Henry]] for his opening sketch for the 2011 [[Comic Relief]], during which he [[parody|spoofed]] the film and grew impatient with [[Colin Firth]]'s portrayal of [[King George VI]] as he stammered over his speech.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stammering.org/rednoseday.html|title=No relief for children who stammer on Red Nose Day| publisher= British Stammering Association| author= Norbert Lieckfeldt, BSA Chief Executive|date= April 2011|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that the British Stammering Association had branded the sketch as "a gross and disgusting gleefulness at pointing out someone else's misfortune".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a310070/lenny-henry-criticised-for-speech-spoof.html| title=Lenny Henry criticised for 'Speech' spoof | publisher= ''[[Digital Spy]]''| accessdate=21 March 2011 | author=Ryan Love | year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3480049/Lenny-Henrys-stammer-joke-is-blasted.html | title=Lenny Henry's stammer joke is blasted| work= [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']]| accessdate=22 March 2011  | date= 21 March 2011}}</ref>

In 2007 the Association's then Chair, Leys Geddes, strongly protested to the [[YouTube]] website about their classifying, as comedy, videos showing people struggling to speak, including three which he said appeared to be "malicious and stereotypical".<ref name=YouTube>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/25/news.youtube |title= Anger at YouTube stammer clips|author=Sarah Boseley|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date= 25 September 2007|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7014089.stm |title= 'You become a self-editing machine'|author=Denise Winterman|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date= 27 September 2007|accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref> YouTube replied that the videos did not violate its terms of use. Geddes has now posted his own video on YouTube, arguing for greater understanding for those who stammer. 

Speaking in support of the Association's stance, Labour MP [[Kate Hoey]] said: "For many people, particularly youngsters, stammering is not a joke – we need to ensure that help and support is given as early as possible and, most of all, we need to educate the public to understand the impact it has on people for the whole of their lives."<ref name=YouTube/>

In May 2012, the Association criticised a headline and story on the front page of ''The Sun'' mocking newly appointed England football manager [[Roy Hodgson]]'s [[rhotacism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/jeremy-laurance-hodgson-wont-care-but-this-could-severely-affect-children-7707298.html|title=Hodgson won’t care, but this could severely affect children|author= Jeremy Laurence|publisher= ''[[The Independent]]''|date= 3 May 2012|accessdate= 6 May 2012}}</ref>

To mark [[International Stuttering Awareness Day|International Stammering Awareness Day]] on 22 October 2012, the Association announced the forthcoming launch of the Employers Stammering Network, an alliance between employers and the BSA, which aims to create a culture where people who stammer can achieve their full potential.<ref name="Wilkie">{{cite news | url=http://www.cityam.com/forum/why-stammering-didn-t-hold-back-my-career-ey | title=Why stammering didn't hold back my career at E&Y | work=[[City A.M.]] | date=22 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 | author=Iain Wilkie | location=London}}</ref> The network is to be launched on 9 May 2013 with a reception in the House of Commons hosted by Ed Balls MP.<ref name="Launch">{{cite journal | title=Unlocking talent - The Employers Stammering Network | author=Norbert Lieckfeldt | journal=Speaking Out | year=2013 | month=Spring | pages=17}}</ref>

Commenting on the media coverage of Ed Balls' stumbling over his response in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 5 December 2012 to the [[Autumn Statement]] by [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]], Norbert Lieckfeldt said: "The experience of a lifetime of stammering gives an edge to a personality, something to rub against, and I'd prefer that over smooth glibness any day. This is also the advice we at the British Stammering Association would give to anyone who stammers who is considering a career in politics".<ref name="MPs"/>
