Waardenburg syndrome (also '''Waardenburg­ Shah Syndrome''', '''Waardenburg-Klein syndrome''', '''Mende's syndrome II''', '''Van der Hoeve-Halbertsma-Waardenburg syndrome''', '''Ptosis-Epicanthus syndrome''', '''Van der Hoeve-Halbertsma-Gualdi syndrome''', '''Waardenburg type Pierpont''',[5] '''Van der Hoeve-Waardenburg-Klein syndrome''', '''Waardenburg's syndrome II''' and '''Vogt’s syndrome''') is a rare [[genetic disorder]] most often characterized by varying degrees of [[deafness]], minor defects in structures arising from the [[neural crest]], and pigmentation anomalies. Disruptions in [[myogenesis]], particularly mutations in Pax3, can cause Waardenburg syndrome I and III. 

It was first described in 1951.<ref name=Waardenburg1951>{{cite journal |author=Waardenburg PJ |title=A new syndrome combining developmental anomalies of the eyelids, eyebrows and noseroot with pigmentary anomalies of the iris and head hair and with congenital deafness; Dystopia canthi medialis et punctorum lacrimalium lateroversa, hyperplasia supercilii medialis et radicis nasi, heterochromia iridum totaliis sive partialis, albinismus circumscriptus (leucismus, polioss) et surditas congenita (surdimutitas) |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=195–253 |year=1951 |month=September |pmid=14902764 |pmc=1716407 }}</ref>

== Eponyms and classification ==
Waardenburg syndrome is named after [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Petrus Johannes Waardenburg]] (1886–1979), who described the syndrome in detail in 1951.<ref name=Waardenburg1951/><ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|1012}}</ref> The condition he described is now categorized as WS1. Swiss ophthalmologist [[David Klein (ophthalmologist)|David Klein]] also made contributions towards the understanding of the syndrome.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1086|Klein-Waardenburg syndrome}}</ref>

WS2 was identified in 1971, to describe cases where "[[dystopia canthorum]]" did not present.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arias S |title=Genetic heterogeneity in the Waardenburg syndrome |journal=Birth Defects  Orig. Artic. Ser. |volume=07 |issue=4 |pages=87–101 |year=1971 |pmid=5006208}}</ref> WS2 is now split into subtypes, based upon the gene responsible.

Other types have been identified, but they are less common. 

==Signs and symptoms==

There are five major and five minor diagnostic criteria for Waardenburg syndrome.

Major: 
*sensorineural hearing loss
*[[iris (anatomy)|iris]] pigmentary abnormality (two eyes different color or iris bicolor or characteristic brilliant blue iris) 
*hair hypopigmentation (white forelock or white hairs at other sites on the body) 
*[[dystopia canthorum]] (lateral displacement of inner [[canthus|canthi]]) 
*first‐degree relative previously diagnosed with Waardenburg syndrome

Minor:
*skin hypopigmentation (congenital leukoderma/white skin patches)
*medial eyebrow flare ([[synophrys]])
*broad nasal root 
*hypoplasia alae nasi
*premature graying of the hair (before age 30).

==Epidemiology==
The overall incidence is ~1/42,000 to 1/50,000 people. Types I and II are the most common types of the syndrome, whereas types III and IV are rare. Type 4 is also known as Waardenburg‐Shah syndrome (association of Waardenburg syndrome with Hirschsprung disease).

Type 4 is rare with only 48 cases reported up to 2002.<ref name=Egbalian2008>{{cite journal |author=Egbalian F |title=Waardenburg Shah syndrome; A case report and review of the literature |journal=Iran J Ped |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=71–7 |year=2008 }}</ref>

About 1 in 30 students in schools for the [[deafness|deaf]] have Waardenburg syndrome.  All races and both sexes are affected equally.  The highly variable presentation of the syndrome makes it difficult to arrive at precise figures for its prevalence.

==Classification==
Subtypes of the syndrome are traceable to different genetic variations:

== Symptoms ==
[[Image:Patient_with_Waardenburg-Klein_syndrome_(1916).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Facial [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of Waardenburg syndrome]]

Symptoms vary from one type of the syndrome to another and from one patient to another, but they include:
* Very pale or brilliantly blue eyes, eyes of two different colors (complete [[heterochromia]]), or eyes with one iris having two different colours (sectoral heterochromia); 
* A forelock of white hair ([[poliosis]]), or premature graying of the hair;
* Appearance of wide-set eyes due to a prominent, broad nasal root ([[dystopia canthorum]])—particularly associated with type I) also known as [[telecanthus]]; 
* Moderate to profound hearing loss (higher frequency associated with type II); 
* A low hairline and eyebrows that touch in the middle.
* Patches of white [[pigmentation]] on the [[skin]] have been observed in some people. Sometimes, abnormalities of the arms, associated with type III, have been observed. 
* Type IV may include [[Neurological disorders|neurologic manifestations]].

Waardenburg syndrome has also been associated with a variety of other [[congenital disorder]]s, such as [[intestine|intestinal]] and [[vertebral column|spinal]] defects, elevation of the [[scapula]], and [[cleft lip and palate]].  Sometimes this is concurrent with [[Hirschsprung disease]].

== Inheritance ==
This condition is usually inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. A small percentage of cases result from new mutations in the gene; these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

Some cases of type II and type IV Waardenburg syndrome appear to have an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance, which means two copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.

== Treatment ==
There is currently no treatment or cure for Waardenburg syndrome. The symptom most likely to be of practical importance is deafness, and this is treated as any other irreversible deafness would be.  In marked cases there may be cosmetic issues.  Other abnormalities (neurological, structural, [[Hirschsprung disease]]) associated with the syndrome are treated symptomatically.

== In animals ==
Waardenburg syndrome is known to occur in [[ferrets]].  The affected animal will usually have a small white stripe along the top or back of its head, sometimes down the back of the neck (known as a blaze) or a solid white head (from nose to shoulders; ferrets with this are known as a panda marked ferret) and a somewhat, although barely noticeably, flatter skull than normal ferrets.  As a ferret's sense of hearing is poor to begin with it is not easily noticeable except for when the affected animal does not react to loud noises that non-affected ones will respond to.  As the disorder is easily spread to offspring, the affected animal will not be used for breeding by private, reputable breeders, although it may still be neutered and sold as a pet. However, largely as a result of mass-breeding due to the "exotic" markings it gives (when compared to a standard sable/pole cat marked or albino ferret), 75% of US ferrets with a blaze or white head sold from pet stores are deaf.<ref>Erika Matulich, Ph.D, [http://www.cypresskeep.com/Ferretfiles/Deaf.htm Cypresskeep.com]</ref>

== In popular culture ==
In the season 6 episode of [[Bones (TV Series)]], 'The Signs in the Silence', the team must solve a case in which the suspected killer has Waardenburg syndrome.

Enzo Macleod, protagonist of [[Peter May (writer)|Peter May]]'s series ''[[The Enzo Files]]'', has Waardenburg syndrome.  His eyes are different colors and he has a white streak in his hair.  See pp. 17-18 of "Extraordinary People" (2006) by Peter Mays.
