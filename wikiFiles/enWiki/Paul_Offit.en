'''Paul A. Offit''' is an [[United States|American]] [[pediatrician]] specializing in [[infectious disease]]s and an expert on [[vaccine]]s, [[immunology]], and [[virology]]. He is the co-inventor of a [[rotavirus vaccine]] that has been credited with saving hundreds of lives every day. Offit is the [[Maurice R. Hilleman]] Professor of Vaccinology, Professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at The [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]]. He has been a member of the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]].<ref name=Kalb/> Offit is also a Founding Board Member of the [[Autism Science Foundation]] (ASF).<ref>{{cite web|title=ASF Founding Board Member Dr. Paul Offit Elected to the Institute of Medicine|url=http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/asf-founding-board-member-dr-paul-offit-elected-to-the-institute-of-medicine/|publisher=[[Autism Science Foundation]]|accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>  

Offit has published more than 130 papers in medical and scientific journals in the areas of [[rotavirus]]-specific immune responses and vaccine safety,<ref name=Kalb/> and is the author or co-author of books on vaccines, vaccination, and antibiotics. He is one of the most public faces of the [[scientific consensus]] that vaccines have no association with [[autism]], and has, as a result, attracted controversy and a substantial volume of [[hate mail]] and occasional death threats,<ref name=nyt/><ref name=inquirer/> but also support for his position.<ref name=Kalb/><ref name=Reuters>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,495485,00.html?sPage=fnc/health/neurology Author: Vaccine Book Brings Out Hidden Support After Death Threats].

==Life==

Offit grew up in Baltimore, the son of a shirtmaker. He went to his father's sales meetings and reacted negatively to the tall tales told by salespeople, preferring instead what he saw as the clean and straightforward life of science.<ref name=Fagone/> When he was five years old, he was sent to a [[polio]] ward to recover from [[clubfoot]] surgery; this experience caused him to see children as vulnerable and helpless, and motivated him through the 25 years of the development of the rotavirus vaccine.<ref name=Kalb>{{cite journal |author= Kalb C |title= Stomping through a medical minefield |journal=Newsweek |volume=152 |issue=18 |pages=62–3 |date=2008-11-03 |pmid=18998447 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/165644}}</ref><ref name=Campbell>{{cite web |url=http://www.docartemis.com/Transcripts/25-booksandideas-Offit.pdf |format=PDF |title= Interview with Dr. Paul Offit, MD, on vaccine safety |work= Books and Ideas |author= Campbell G |date=2009-01-30}} [http://media.libsyn.com/media/booksandideas/25-booksandideas-vaccinesAREsafe.mp3 Podcast] (MP3). Retrieved 2009-05-13.</ref>

Offit decided to become a doctor, the first in his family.<ref name=Wallace/> Offit earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Tufts University]] and his [[Doctor of medicine|M.D.]] from the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]]. One of his mentors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was [[Maurice R. Hilleman]], the greatest vaccine-maker of the 20th century.<ref name=Fagone/>

By 2008 Offit had become the U.S.'s leading advocate of childhood [[immunization]]s. He was opposed by vaccine critics, many of whom believe vaccines cause autism, a belief not supported by scientific data. He received a death threat and received protection by an armed guard during meetings at the CDC.<ref name=Kalb/> His 2008 book ''[[Autism's False Prophets]]'' catalyzed a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the U.S.<ref name=nyt/> He donated the [[royalties]] from the book to the Center for Autism Research at [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]].<ref name=royalties/> Offit serves on the board of the [[American Council on Science and Health]].<ref name="acsh">{{cite web | publisher = [[American Council on Science and Health]] | url = http://www.acsh.org/about/pageID.139/default.asp | title = Board members}}</ref>

==Rotavirus vaccine==

Offit worked for 25 years on the development of a safe and effective vaccine against [[rotavirus]], which is a cause of [[gastroenteritis]],<ref name=inquirer>{{cite news |author= Avril T |date=2008-09-17 |work= Philadelphia Inquirer |title= Expert sees no link between vaccines and autism }}</ref> and which kills as many as 600,000 children a year worldwide, about half as many as [[malaria]] kills; most deaths are outside the West.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13auti.html | work = New York Times | author = McNeil DG Jr | date = 2009-01-12 | accessdate = 2009-01-13 | title = Book is rallying resistance to the antivaccine crusade }}</ref> His interest in the disease stemmed from the death of a 9-month-old infant from rotavirus-caused dehydration while under his care as a [[residency (medicine)|pediatric resident]] in 1979.<ref name="inquirer"/><ref name=Campbell/> 

Along with his colleagues Fred Clark and Stanley Plotkin, Offit invented RotaTeq,<ref name=Wallace/> a pentavalent [[rotavirus vaccine]] which is currently manufactured by [[Merck & Co.]] RotaTeq is one of two vaccines currently used against [[rotavirus]], which replaced an earlier vaccine withdrawn after being blamed, perhaps incorrectly, for very rare cases of [[intussusception]].<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |work= [[New York Times]] |url=http://nytimes.com/2006/01/05/science/05vaccine.html |author= McNeil DG Jr |title= Rotavirus drugs deemed safe and effective |date=2006-01-05 |accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>

==Smallpox vaccine==
In 2002, during a period of fears about [[bioterrorism]], Offit was the only member of the CDC's advisory panel to vote against a program to give smallpox vaccine to tens of thousands of Americans. He later argued on ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' and ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' that the risk of harm for people getting the vaccine outweighed the risk of getting smallpox in the U.S. at the time.<ref name=Wallace>{{cite news |author=Wallace A |title=An epidemic of fear: how panicked parents skipping shots endangers us all |work=Wired |date=2009-10-19 |url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1 |accessdate=2009-10-21 }}</ref>

==Recognition==

Offit is a recipient of numerous awards, including the J. Edmund Bradley Prize for Excellence in Pediatrics from the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|University of Maryland]] Medical School, the Young Investigator Award in Vaccine Development from the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]], and a Research Career Development Award from the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref name=royalties>{{cite press release |title= Author royalties from autism book donated to autism research |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=159681&TICK=CHOP&STORY=/www/story/11-03-2008/0004917307&EDATE=Nov+3,+2008 |date=2008-11-03 |publisher =[[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]]}}</ref>

[[Michael Specter]] wrote that Offit "has become a figure of hatred to the many vaccine denialists and conspiracy theorists." Specter reported that Offit had often been threatened with violence by anti-vaccine advocates, necessitating precautions such as screening Offit's packages for [[mail bomb]]s and providing guards when Offit attends federal health advisory committee meetings.<ref name="specter">{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Specter | title = Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives | authorlink = Michael Specter | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-59420-230-8}}</ref> At a 2008 vaccine activism rally in Washington, DC, environmental lawyer [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] criticized Offit's ties to drug companies, calling him a "poster child for the term 'biostitute'."<ref name=Fagone>{{cite news |author=Fagone J |title=Will this doctor hurt your baby? |date=June 2009 |work=Philadelphia |url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/will_this_doctor_hurt_your_baby/ |accessdate=2009-06-25 }}</ref> Curt Linderman Sr., the editor of the Autism File blog, wrote online that it would "be nice" if Offit "was dead".<ref name=Wallace/>

Such vilification has provoked statements in Offit's defense. [[Peter Hotez]], a professor and vaccine researcher at [[George Washington University]], has been quoted in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article:

: Peter Hotez ... says government health officials should take a bolder stand in reassuring the public. Hotez feels as strongly as Offit does about the science (saying vaccines cause autism, he says, "is like saying the world is flat"), but, like other busy scientists, he's less willing to enter the fray. "Here's someone who has created an invention that saves hundreds of lives every day," says Hotez, whose daughter, 15, has autism, "and he's vilified as someone who hates children. It's just so unfair."<ref name=Kalb/>

In 2011 Offit was honored by the Biotechnology Industry Organization with the 2011 Biotech Humanitarian Award.<ref name="BIOTECH AWARD PRESS RELEASE">[http://nctechnews.com/2011/06/29/awards/dr-paul-offit-receives-2011-biotech-humanitarian-award/5482/]</ref> Offit donated the award’s $10,000 prize to the Vaccine Education Center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.<ref name="PHILADELPHIA BUSINESS JOUNRAL ARTICALr">{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/john-george/2011/06/bio-award-goes-to-doctor-who-developed.html?page=all | first=John | last=George | title=CHOP doctor who developed rotavirus vaccine honored | date=2011-06-29}}</ref>

In 2001 Offit was elected to the [[Institute of Medicine]] at the group's annual meeting.<ref>{{citation | url=http://iom.edu/Global/News%20Announcements/2011-New-Members.aspx | title=IOM Elects 65 New Members, Five Foreign Associates | date=October 17, 2011 | author=Stencel, Christine | publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]] | accessdate=October 19, 2011 }}</ref>

==Publications==

Offit has written or co-written several books on vaccines, vaccination and the public, and antibiotics, as well as dozens of scholarly articles on the topic. [[Isabelle Rapin]], a neurology professor at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], wrote in ''[[Neurology Today]]'' about ''Autism's False Prophets'':

:This book explores why parents, seeking in vain for a cure and for an explanation of their child's problem, are so vulnerable to false hopes and to the nasty predators who have from time immemorial always taken advantage of the desperate in our society. ... [Offit] became outraged by Dr. [[Andrew Wakefield]]'s 1998 study in the Lancet that blamed the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for causing autism. Dr. Offit predicted the paper would precipitate a resurgence of measles and its serious complications, and even deaths–a prophecy soon realized.<ref name=Rapin>{{cite journal |url= http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2009/01150/High_Hopes,_Shoddy_Research_and_Elusive_Therapies.11.aspx |journal= Neurology Today |date= 15 January 2009 |volume= 9 |issue= 2 |page= 23 |doi= 10.1097/01.NT.0000345037.57123.0b |title= High Hopes, Shoddy Research and Elusive Therapies for Autism Examined and Exposed |author= Rapin I |format= Book review}}</ref>
