== Classification ==
''L. monocytogenes'' is a Gram-positive, nonspore-forming, motile, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative, and expresses a beta hemolysin, which causes destruction of red blood cells. This bacterium exhibits characteristic tumbling motility when viewed with light microscopy.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=J. M. |last1=Farber |first2=P.

The genus ''Listeria'' belongs to the class, ''Bacilli'', and the order, ''Bacillales'', which also includes ''Bacillus'' and ''Staphylococcus''. The genus ''Listeria'' includes seven different species (''L. monocytogenes'', ''L. ivanovii'', ''L. innocua'', ''L. welshimeri'', ''L. seeligeri'', ''L. grayi'', and ''L. murrayi''). Both ''L. ivanovii'' and ''L. monocytogenes'' are pathogenic in mice, but only ''L. monocytogenes'' is consistently associated with human illness.<ref>Seafood HACCP Alliance (2007).

== History ==
''L. monocytogenes'' was first described by E.G.D. Murray in 1926 based on six cases of sudden death in young rabbits.<ref>Murray, E.G.D., Webb, R.E., Swann, M.B.R. 1926. A disease of rabbits characterized by a large mononuclear leucocytosis, caused by a hitherto undescribed bacillus Bacterium monocytogenes (n. sp.). J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 29: 407– 439.</ref>
Murray referred to the organism as ''Bacterium monocytogenes'' before [[Harvey Pirie]] changed the genus name to ''[[Listeria]]'' in 1940.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harvey P.J.H. | year = 1940 | title = Listeria: change of name for a genus of bacteria| bibcode=1940Natur.145..264P | doi=10.1038/145264a0 | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 145 | issue = 3668| page = 264 }}</ref> Although clinical descriptions of ''L. monocytogenes'' infection in both animals and humans were published in the 1920s, not until 1952 in [[East Germany]] was it recognized as a significant cause of neonatal [[sepsis]] and [[meningitis]].<ref>Potel, J. 1952.

Not until 1981, however, was ''L. monocytogenes'' identified as a cause of foodborne illness. An outbreak of listeriosis in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] involving 41 cases and 18 deaths, mostly in pregnant women and neonates, was epidemiologically linked to the consumption of coleslaw containing cabbage that had been treated with ''L. monocytogenes''-contaminated raw sheep manure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schlech WF, Lavigne PM, Bortolussi RA, ''et al.'' |title=Epidemic listeriosis--evidence for transmission by food |journal=N.

[[Influenza]]-like symptoms, including persistent fever, usually precede the onset of the aforementioned disorders. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and [[diarrhea]], may precede more serious forms of listeriosis or may be the only symptoms expressed. Gastrointestinal symptoms were epidemiologically associated with use of [[antacid]]s or [[cimetidine]]. The onset time to serious forms of listeriosis is unknown, but may range from a few days to three weeks. The onset time to gastrointestinal symptoms is unknown but probably exceeds 12 hours.

''Listeria'' cell walls consistently contain lipoteichoic acids, in which a glycolipid moiety, such as a galactosyl-glucosyl-diglyceride, is covalently linked to the terminal phosphomonoester of the teichoic acid. This lipid region anchors the polymer chain to the cytoplasmic membrane. These lipoteichoic acids resemble the lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria in both structure and function, being the only amphipathic polymers at the cell surface.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fiedler |first1=F |title=Biochemistry of the cell surface of Listeria strains: a locating general view |journal=Infection |volume=16 Suppl 2 |pages=S92–7 |year=1988 |pmid=3417357}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Farber |first1=JM |last2=Peterkin |first2=PI |title=Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen |journal=Microbiological reviews |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=476–511 |year=1991 |pmid=1943998 |pmc=372831}}</ref>

''L. monocytogenes'' has D-Galactose residues on its surface that can attach to D-Galactose receptors on the host cell walls. These host cells are generally [[M cells]] and [[Peyer's patches]] of the intestinal mucosa. Once attached to this cells, ''L. monocytogenes'' can translocate past the intestinal membrane and into the body. 

The infective dose of ''L. monocytogenes'' varies with the strain and with the susceptibility of the victim. From cases contracted through raw or supposedly pasteurized milk, one may safely assume that, in susceptible persons, fewer than 1,000 total organisms may cause disease. ''L. monocytogenes'' may invade the gastrointestinal epithelium. Once the bacterium enters the host's [[monocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, or [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s, it becomes blood-borne (septicemic) and can grow. Its presence intracellularly in [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells also permits access to the brain and probably transplacental migration to the fetus in pregnant women. The pathogenesis of ''L. monocytogenes'' centers on its ability to survive and multiply in phagocytic host cells. It seems that Listeria originally evolved to invade membranes of the intestines, as an intracellular infection, and developed a chemical mechanism to do so. This involves a bacterial protein "internalin" which attaches to a protein on the intestinal cell membrane "cadherin". These adhesion molecules are also to be found in two other unusually tough barriers in humans&nbsp;— the blood brain barrier and the feto–placental barrier, and this may explain the apparent affinity that Listeria has for causing meningitis and affecting babies in-utero.

===Regulation of pathogenesis ===
''L. monocytogenes'' can act as a [[saprophyte]] or a [[pathogen]], depending on its environment. When this bacterium is present within a host organism, [[quorum sensing]] causes the up regulation of several [[virulence]] genes. Depending on the location of the bacterium within the host organism, different activators up regulate the virulence genes. SigB, an alternative [[sigma factor]], up regulates Vir genes in the intestines, whereas [[PrfA thermoregulator UTR|PrfA]] up regulates gene expression when the bacterium is present in blood.<ref name="pmid1662763">{{cite journal |last1=Mengaud |first1=J. |last2=Dramsi |first2=S. |last3=Gouin |first3=E. |last4=Vazquez-Boland |first4=J.

== Treatment ==
When listeric meningitis occurs, the overall [[death|mortality]] may reach 70%, from septicemia 50%, and from perinatal/neonatal infections greater than 80%. In infections during pregnancy, the mother usually survives. Reports of successful treatment with parenteral [[penicillin]] or [[ampicillin]] exist. [[Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]]  has been shown effective in patients allergic to penicillin.

A bacteriophage, ''[[Listeria phage P100]]'', has been proposed as [[food additive]] to control ''Listeria monocytogenes''.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16188359|year=2005|last1=Carlton|first1=RM|last2=Noordman|first2=WH|last3=Biswas|first3=B|last4=De Meester|first4=ED|last5=Loessner|first5=MJ|title=Bacteriophage P100 for control of Listeria monocytogenes in foods: Genome sequence, bioinformatic analyses, oral toxicity study, and application|volume=43|issue=3|pages=301–12|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2005.08.005|journal=[[Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology]]}}</ref> Bacteriophage treatments have been developed by several companies.

Uses would potentially include spraying it on fruits and ready-to-eat meat such as sliced ham and turkey.

==Detection==
[[Image:LSA.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Colonies of typical ''Listeria monocytogenes'' as they appear when grown on ''Listeria''-selective [[agar]]]]

The methods for analysis of food are complex and time-consuming. The present U.S. FDA method, revised in September 1990, requires 24 and 48 hours of enrichment, followed by a variety of other tests. Total time to identification takes from five to seven days, but the announcement of specific nonradiolabelled [[DNA probes]] should soon allow a simpler and faster confirmation of suspect isolates.

Recombinant DNA technology may even permit two- to three-day positive analysis in the future. Currently, the FDA is collaborating in adapting its methodology to quantitate very low numbers of the organisms in foods.

==Epidemiology==
Researchers have found ''L. monocytogenes'' in at least 37 [[mammal|mammalian species]], both domesticated and feral, as well as in at least 17 species of [[birds]] and possibly in some species of [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. Laboratories can isolate ''L. monocytogenes'' from [[soil]], [[silage]], and other environmental sources. ''L. monocytogenes'' is quite hardy and resists the deleterious effects of freezing, drying, and heat remarkably well for a bacterium that does not form spores. Most ''L. monocytogenes'' strains are pathogenic to some degree.

==Infectious cycle==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:LifeCyclePortnoy02.gif|frame|Infectious Life Cycle]] -->
The primary site of infection is the intestinal epithelium, where the bacteria invade nonphagocytic cells via the "zipper" mechanism. Uptake is stimulated by the binding of listerial internalins (Inl) to E-[[cadherin]], a host cell adhesion factor, or Met ([[c-Met]]), hepatocyte growth factor. This binding activates certain Rho-GTPases, which subsequently bind and stabilize Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (WAsp). WAsp can then bind the [[Arp2/3 complex]] and serve as an [[actin]] nucleation point. Subsequent actin polymerization creates a "phagocytic cup", an actin-based structure normally formed around foreign materials by phagocytes prior to endocytosis. The net effect of internalin binding is to exploit the junction-forming apparatus of the host into internalizing the bacterium. ''L. monocytogenes'' can also invade phagocytic cells (e.g., [[macrophages]]), but requires only internalins for invasion of nonphagocytic cells.

Following internalization, the bacterium must escape from the vacuole/phagosome before fusion with a [[lysosome]] can occur. Three main virulence factors that allow the bacterium to escape are [[listeriolysin O]] (LLO-encoded by ''hly'') phospholipase A (encoded by ''plcA'') and [[phospholipase B]] (''plcB'').<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schmid M.

Once in the cytoplasm, ''L. monocytogenes'' exploits host [[actin]] for the second time. [[Actin assembly-inducing protein|ActA proteins]] associated with the old bacterial cell pole (being a bacillus, ''L. monocytogenes'' septates in the middle of the cell and thus has one new pole and one old pole) are capable of binding the [[Arp2/3 complex]], thereby inducing actin nucleation at a specific area of the bacterial cell surface. Actin polymerization then propels the bacterium unidirectionally into the host cell membrane. The protrusion that is formed may then be internalized by a neighboring cell, forming a double-membrane vacuole from which the bacterium must escape using LLO and PlcB. This mode of direct cell-to-cell spread involves a cellular mechanism known as [[paracytophagy]].<ref name="pmid10491395">{{cite journal| author=Robbins JR, Barth AI, Marquis H, de Hostos EL, Nelson WJ, Theriot JA| title=Listeria monocytogenes Exploits Normal Host Cell Processes to Spread from Cell to Cell✪ | journal=J Cell Biol | year= 1999 | volume= 146 | issue= 6 | pages= 1333–50 | pmid=10491395 | doi= 10.1083/jcb.146.6.1333| pmc=1785326 | url= }}</ref>
