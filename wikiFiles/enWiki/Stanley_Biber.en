[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/21/national/21biber.html Stanley H. Biber, 82, Surgeon Among First to Do Sex Changes, Dies]. ''[[New York Times]]''</ref>

==Early life==
Biber was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] as the older of two children and the only son of a father who owned a furniture store and a mother interested in social causes.<ref>Auge, Karen. [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16843484 "Well-known Trinidad sex-reassignment doctor leaves; Sex-reassignment doctor moves out of Trinidad, leaving the town to forge a new legacy"], ''[[The Denver Post]]'', December 13, 2010. Accessed February 24, 2013. "Mike Gerardo, like most Trinidadians of his era, was ushered into life by Bowers' predecessor, Dr. Stanley Biber. Doc Biber, as he's known, wasn't from Trinidad. He was Jewish in a town that, back then, was overwhelmingly Catholic."</ref>

After giving up plans to become a pianist and [[rabbi]], Biber served as a civilian employee with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during [[World War II]], stationed in Alaska and the Northwest Territory. After the war, he returned to Iowa and enrolled in school, with plans to become a [[psychiatrist]].

==Career as a physician==
Biber graduated from the [[University of Iowa]] [[medical school]] in 1948.<ref name="martin">Martin, Claire (18 January 2006). [http://www.denverpost.com/obituaries/ci_3411964 Pioneer sex-change surgeon dies at 82]. ''[[Denver Post]]''</ref> He began performing surgery while in residency at a hospital in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. Biber then joined the Army, where he was the chief surgeon of a [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] unit in the [[Korean War]]. He finished his service at what is now [[Fort Carson, Colorado]], and in 1954 took a job at a [[United Mine Workers]] clinic in [[Trinidad, Colorado]].<ref name="frazier">Frazier, Deborah (19 January 2006).

Biber performed his first [[sex change operation]] in 1969 after a [[trans woman|transsexual woman]] asked him if he would be willing and able to do so. At first, he did not know how, but he learned by studying diagrams from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]]. He kept his first few surgeries secret from the Catholic nuns who operated the hospital, due to concerns that they would react negatively. Trinidad subsequently became known as the "Sex Change Capital of the World" because of his renown.<ref name="nprobit">Brady, Jeff (19 January 2006).

Biber also trained dozens of other surgeons in gender reversal techniques and maintained a regular surgical practice of delivering babies, removing tonsils, and replacing knee and hip joints.<ref name="apobit">Associated Press (17 January 2006).

==Retirement and late life==
Biber retired in 2003, at age 80, because his [[medical malpractice|malpractice]] insurance premiums had risen to levels which he could not afford, probably because of his advanced age.<ref name="apretire">Associated Press (3 January 2005).
