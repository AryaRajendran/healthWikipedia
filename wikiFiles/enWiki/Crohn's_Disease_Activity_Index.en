The '''Crohn's Disease Activity Index''' or '''CDAI''' is a research tool used to quantify the symptoms of patients with [[Crohn's disease]].  This is of importance in research studies done on medications used to treat Crohn's disease; most major studies on newer medications use the CDAI in order to define response or [[remission]] of disease.  As Crohn's disease is a disease with a variety of symptoms that affect [[quality of life]], the quantification of symptoms may be of secondary importance to a quantitative assessment of the effect on quality of life.  This has been addressed by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and other indices of quality of life for patients with Crohn's disease.<ref name=JanIrvine>{{cite journal | author = Irvine E, Feagan B, Rochon J, Archambault A, Fedorak R, Groll A, Kinnear D, Saibil F, McDonald J | title = Quality of life: a valid and reliable measure of therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Canadian Crohn's Relapse Prevention Trial Study Group. | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–96 | year = 1994 | id = | pmid=8299896}}</ref>

==Components of the index==
The CDAI was developed by WR Best and colleagues from the Midwest Regional Health Center in [[Illinois]], in 1976.<!--

National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study|year = 1976|month = March | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–444 | id = | pmid=1248701}}</ref>  <!--
-->The index consists of eight factors, each summed after adjustment with a weighting factor.  The components of the CDAI and weighting factors are the following:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Clinical or laboratory variable
! Weighting factor
|-
|Number of liquid or soft [[feces|stools]] each day for seven days
|x 2
|-
|[[Abdominal pain]] (graded from 0-3 on severity) each day for seven days
|x 5
|-
|General well being, subjectively assessed from 0 (well) to 4 (terrible) each day for seven days
|x 7
|-
|Presence of complications<sup>*</sup>
|x 20
|-
|Taking Lomotil or opiates for diarrhea
|x 30
|-
|Presence of an abdominal mass (0 as none, 2 as questionable, 5 as definite)
|x 10
|-
|[[Hematocrit]] of <0.47 in men and <0.42 in women
|x 6
|-
|Percentage deviation from standard weight
|x 1
|}
<sup><nowiki>*</nowiki></sub>One point each is added for each set of complications:
* the presence of joint pains ([[arthralgia]]) or frank [[arthritis]]
* inflammation of the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] or [[uveitis]]
* presence of [[erythema nodosum]], [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], or [[mouth ulcer|aphthous ulcers]]
* [[anal fissure]]s, [[fistula]]e or [[abscess]]es
* other [[fistula]]e
* [[fever]] during the previous week.

[[Remission]] of Crohn's disease is defined as a fall in the CDAI of less than 150.  Severe disease was defined as a value of greater than 450.<ref name=Best/>  Most major research studies on medications in Crohn's disease define response as a fall of the CDAI of greater than 70 points.<ref name=ACCENT2>{{cite journal | author = Sands B, Anderson F, Bernstein C, Chey W, Feagan B, Fedorak R, Kamm M, Korzenik J, Lashner B, Onken J, Rachmilewitz D, Rutgeerts P, Wild G, Wolf D, Marsters P, Travers S, Blank M, van Deventer S | title = Infliximab maintenance therapy for fistulizing Crohn's disease. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 350 | issue = 9 | pages = 876–85 | year = 2004 | id = | pmid=14985485 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa030815}}</ref><ref name=ACCENT1>{{cite journal | author = Hanauer S, Feagan B, Lichtenstein G, [[Lloyd Mayer|Mayer L]], Schreiber S, Colombel J, Rachmilewitz D, Wolf D, Olson A, Bao W, Rutgeerts P | title = Maintenance infliximab for Crohn's disease: the ACCENT I randomised trial. | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9317 | pages = 1541–9 | year = 2002 | id = | pmid=12047962 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08512-4}}</ref>

==Harvey-Bradshaw index==
The ''Harvey-Bradshaw index'' was devised in 1980 as a simpler version of the CDAI for data collection purposes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harvey R, Bradshaw J | title = A simple index of Crohn's-disease activity. | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8167 | pages = 514 | year = 1980 | id = | pmid=6102236 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(80)92767-1}}</ref>  It consists of only clinical parameters:
*general well-being (0 = very well, 1 = slightly below average, 2 = poor, 3 = very poor, 4 = terrible)
*abdominal pain (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe)
*number of liquid stools per day
*abdominal mass (0 = none, 1 = dubious, 2 = definite, 3 = tender)
*complications, as above, with one point for each.
A Simple Index of Crohn's disease activity has also been developed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Elliott P, Lennard-Jones J, Hathway N | title = Simple index of Crohn's disease activity. | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8173 | pages = 876 | year = 1980 | id = | pmid=6103229}}</ref>

==Validation of the CDAI==
While the CDAI is considered to be the gold standard for assessing disease activity in Crohn's disease, validation of the index has been varied.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Jørgensen L, Fredholm L, Hyltoft Petersen P, Hey H, Munkholm P, Brandslund I | title = How accurate are clinical activity indices for scoring of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)? | journal = Clin Chem Lab Med | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 403–11 | year = 2005 | id = | pmid=15899657 | doi = 10.1515/CCLM.2005.073}}</ref><!--

-->A key criticism of the CDAI is that it does not incorporate a subjective assessment of quality of life, [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] factors, or systemic features, such as [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] into its calculation.<ref name=JanIrvine/>  Interestingly, the CDAI correlated well with [[protein]] loss in the bowel in patients with [[protein losing enteropathy]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Acciuffi S, Ghosh S, Ferguson A | title = Strengths and limitations of the Crohn's disease activity index, revealed by an objective gut lavage test of gastrointestinal protein loss | journal = Aliment Pharmacol Ther | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–6 | year = 1996 | id = | pmid=8791958 | doi = 10.1111/j.0953-0673.1996.00321.x}}</ref>

==Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire==
As most symptoms of Crohn's disease broadly affect [[quality of life]], attempts have been made to incorporate physical, social, and emotional performance characteristics into tests for severity of [[Crohn's disease]].  The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) was developed to incorporate elements of social, systemic and emotional symptoms, as well as bowel related symptoms into an activity index.  In a study of 305 patients in [[Ontario]], the IBDQ was found to correlate well with the CDAI in assessing disease activity, but had the added benefit of being a more robust tool for determining the effect of symptoms on perceived quality of life.<ref name=JanIrvine/>
