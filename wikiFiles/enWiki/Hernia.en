A '''hernia''' is the protrusion<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000048715|hernia}}</ref> of an organ or the [[fascia]] of an organ through the wall of the cavity that normally contains it.<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hernia hernia]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved December 01, 2012.</ref> There are different kinds of hernia, each requiring a specific management or treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==
By far the most common hernias develop in the [[abdomen]], when a weakness in the abdominal wall evolves into a localized hole, or "defect", through which [[adipose tissue]], or abdominal organs covered with [[peritoneum]], may protrude. Another common hernia involves the [[Spinal disc herniation|spinal discs]] and causes ''[[sciatica]]''. A [[hiatal hernia]] occurs when the stomach protrudes into the ''[[mediastinum]]'' through the esophageal opening in the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].

Hernias may or may not present with either [[pain]] at the site, a visible or palpable lump, or in some cases more vague symptoms resulting from pressure on an organ which has become "stuck" in the hernia, sometimes leading to organ dysfunction. Fatty tissue usually enters a hernia first, but it may be followed or accompanied by an organ. 

Symptoms and signs vary depending on the type of hernia. Symptoms may or may not be present in some [[inguinal hernia]]s. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the [[groin]] or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt. When standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and swelling in the [[scrotum]] around the [[testicular]] area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inguinal-hernia/DS00364/DSECTION=symptoms| title=Symptoms|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> 

Irreducible abdominal hernias or incarcerated hernias may be painful, but their most relevant symptom is that they cannot return to the abdominal cavity when pushed in. They may be chronic, although painless, and can lead to strangulation. Strangulated hernias are always painful and pain is followed by tenderness. [[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], or [[fever]] may occur in these cases due to [[bowel]] obstruction. Also, the hernia bulge in this case may turn red, purple or dark and pink.

In the diagnosis of abdominal hernias, imaging is the principal means of detecting internal diaphragmatic and other nonpalpable or unsuspected hernias. Multidetector CT (MDCT) can show with precision the anatomic site of the hernia sac, the contents of the sac, and any complications. MDCT also offers clear detail of the abdominal wall allowing wall hernias to be identified accurately.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee HK, Park SJ, Yi BH |title=Multidetector CT reveals diverse variety of abdominal hernias |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=27–31 |year=2010 |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/ct/content/article/113619/1575055}}</ref>

==Causes==
Most of the time, hernias develop when pressure in the compartment of the residing organ is increased, and the boundary is weak or weakened.
* Weakening of containing membranes or muscles is usually congenital (which explains part of the tendency of hernias to run in families), and increases with age (for example, degeneration of the [[annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|annulus fibrosus]] of the [[intervertebral disc]]), but it may be on the basis of other illnesses, such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]] or [[Marfan syndrome]], stretching of muscles during pregnancy, losing weight in obese people, etc., or because of scars from previous surgery.
* Many conditions chronically increase intra-abdominal pressure,  (pregnancy, [[ascites]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[dyschezia]], [[benign prostatic hypertrophy]]) and hence abdominal hernias are very frequent. Increased intracranial pressure can cause parts of the brain to herniate through narrowed portions of the cranial cavity or through the [[foramen magnum]]. Increased pressure on the intervertebral discs, as produced by heavy lifting or lifting with improper technique,  increases the risk of herniation.

Causes of hiatal hernia vary depending on each individual. Among the multiple causes, however, are the mechanical causes which include: poison, improper heavy weight lifting, hard [[coughing]] bouts, sharp blows to the abdomen, tight clothing and incorrect [[Human position|posture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inguinalhernia.us/hiatal-hernia-causes.html| title=Hiatal Hernia Symptoms, Causes And Relation To Acid Reflux And Heartburn|accessdate=2010-05-24}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 

Furthermore, conditions that increase the pressure of the abdominal cavity may also cause hernias or worsen the existing ones. Some examples would be: obesity, straining during a bowel movement or urination, chronic lung disease, and also, fluid in the abdominal cavity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hernia/page2_em.htm| title=Hernia Causes|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> 

Also, if muscles are weakened due to [[poor nutrition]], [[smoking]], and [[overexertion]], hernias are more likely to occur.

The physiological school of thought contends that in the case of [[inguinal hernia]], the above mentioned are only an [[anatomical]] symptom of the underlying [[physiological]] cause. They contend that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of [[aponeurotic]] extensions from the [[transversus abdominis]] aponeurotic arch.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Desarda MP |title=Surgical physiology of inguinal hernia repair—a study of 200 cases |journal=BMC Surg |volume=3 |issue= |pages=2 |year=2003 |pmid=12697071 |pmc=155644 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2482/3/2 |doi=10.1186/1471-2482-3-2}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

===Inguinal===
{{main|inguinal hernia}}
[[File:Inquinalhernia.png|thumb|An incarcerated inguinal hernia as seen on CT]]
[[Image:Inguinalhernia.gif|left|thumb|Diagram of an [[indirect inguinal hernia|indirect]], [[scrotum|scrotal]] [[inguinal hernia]] ([[Anatomical position|median]] view from the left).]]
By far the most common hernias (up to 75% of all abdominal hernias) are the so-called inguinal hernias. Inguinal hernias are further divided into the more common [[indirect inguinal hernia]] (2/3, depicted here), in which the inguinal canal is entered via a congenital weakness at its entrance (the internal inguinal ring), and the [[direct inguinal hernia]] type (1/3), where the hernia contents push through a weak spot in the back wall of the inguinal canal. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia in both men and women. In some selected cases, they may require [[inguinal hernia surgery|surgery]].

===Femoral===
{{main|femoral hernia}}
Femoral hernias occur just below the [[inguinal ligament]], when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the [[femoral canal]]. They can be hard to distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and [[inguinal hernia]].

===Umbilical===
{{main|umbilical hernia}}
They involve protrusion of intraabdominal contents through a weakness at the site of passage of the [[umbilical cord]] through the [[abdominal wall]]. These hernias often resolve spontaneously.
Umbilical hernias in adults are largely acquired, and are more frequent in [[obese]] or [[pregnant]] women. Abnormal decussation of fibers at the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] may contribute.

===Incisional===
{{main|incisional hernia}}
An incisional hernia occurs when the defect is the result of an incompletely healed surgical wound. When these occur in median [[laparotomy]] incisions in the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]], they are termed [[ventral hernia]]s. These can be the most frustrating and difficult to treat, as the repair utilizes already attenuated tissue.

===Diaphragmatic===
{{main|diaphragmatic hernia}}
[[Image:Hiatalhernia.gif|thumb|Diagram of a [[hiatus hernia]] ([[Anatomical position|coronal section]], viewed from the front).]]
Higher in the abdomen, an (internal) "diaphragmatic hernia" results when part of the stomach or intestine protrudes into the chest cavity through a defect in the diaphragm.

A [[hiatus hernia]] is a particular variant of this type, in which the normal passageway through which the esophagus meets the stomach ([[Diaphragm (anatomy)|esophageal hiatus]]) serves as a functional "defect", allowing part of the [[stomach]] to (periodically) "herniate" into the chest. Hiatus hernias may be either "''sliding''", in which the [[Esophagus|gastroesophageal junction]] itself slides through the defect into the [[chest]], or non-sliding (also known as ''para-esophageal''), in which case the junction remains fixed while another portion of the stomach moves up through the defect. Non-sliding or para-esophageal hernias can be dangerous as they may allow the stomach to rotate and obstruct. Repair is usually advised.

A [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]] is a distinct problem, occurring in up to 1 in 2000 births, and requiring [[pediatric surgery]]. Intestinal organs may herniate through several parts of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], posterolateral (in [[Vincenc Bochdalek|Bochdalek]]'s triangle, resulting in ''Bochdalek's hernia''), or anteromedial-retrosternal (in the cleft of [[Dominique Jean Larrey|Larrey]]/[[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Morgagni's]] foramen, resulting in ''Morgagni-Larrey hernia'', or [[Morgagni's hernia]]).

===Other hernias===
Since many organs or parts of organs can herniate through many orifices, it is very difficult to give an exhaustive list of hernias, with all synonyms and [[eponyms]]. The above article deals mostly with "visceral hernias", where the herniating tissue arises within the abdominal cavity. Other hernia types and unusual types of visceral hernias are listed below, in alphabetical order:
*[[Amyand's hernia]]: containing the appendix vermiformis within the hernia sac
*Busse's Hernia: a testicle within the hernia sac
*Cooper's hernia: a femoral hernia with two sacs, the first being in the femoral canal, and the second passing through a defect in the superficial fascia and appearing almost immediately beneath the skin.
*[[Epigastric hernia]]: a hernia through the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] above the [[Navel|umbilicus]].
*[[Hiatal hernia]]: a hernia due to "short oesophagus" — insufficient elongation — stomach is displaced into the thorax
*[[Littre's hernia]]: a hernia involving a [[Meckel's diverticulum]]. It is named after the French anatomist [[Alexis Littré]] (1658–1726).
*[[Lumbar hernia]] (Bleichner's Hernia): a hernia in the lumbar region (not to be confused with a lumbar disc hernia), contains the following entities:
**[[Petit's hernia]]: a hernia through Petit's triangle (inferior lumbar triangle). It is named after French surgeon  [[Jean Louis Petit]] (1674–1750).
**[[Grynfeltt's hernia]]: a hernia through Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle (superior lumbar triangle). It is named after physician Joseph Grynfeltt (1840–1913).
*[[Maydl's hernia]]: two adjacent loops of small intestine are within a hernial sac with a tight neck. The intervening portion of bowel within the abdomen is deprived of its blood supply and eventually becomes necrotic.
*Morgagni hernia: a type of hernia where abdominal contents pass into the thorax through a weakness in the diaphragm
*[[Obturator hernia]]: hernia through [[obturator canal]]
*Pantaloon hernia (Saddle Bag hernia): a combined direct and indirect hernia, when the hernial sac protrudes on either side of the [[inferior epigastric vessels]]
*Paraesophageal hernia
*[[Paraumbilical hernia]]: a type of umbilical hernia occurring in adults
*[[Perineal hernia]]: a perineal hernia protrudes through the muscles and fascia of the perineal floor. It may be primary but usually is acquired following perineal prostatectomy, abdominoperineal resection of the rectum, or pelvic exenteration.
*Properitoneal hernia: rare hernia located directly above the peritoneum, for example, when part of an inguinal hernia projects from the [[deep inguinal ring]] to the preperitoneal space.
*[[Richter's hernia]]: a hernia involving only one sidewall of the bowel, which can result in bowel strangulation leading to perforation through ischaemia without causing [[bowel obstruction]] or any of its warning signs. It is named after German surgeon [[August Gottlieb Richter]] (1742–1812).
*[[Sliding hernia]]: occurs when an organ drags along part of the peritoneum, or, in other words, the organ is part of the hernia sac. The [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and the [[urinary bladder]] are often involved. The term also frequently refers to [[sliding hernias of the stomach]].
*Sciatic hernia: this hernia in the [[greater sciatic foramen]] most commonly presents as an uncomfortable mass in the gluteal area. Bowel obstruction may also occur. This type of hernia is only a rare cause of [[sciatic]] neuralgia.
*[[Spigelian hernia]], also known as [[spontaneous lateral ventral hernia]]
*[[Sports hernia]]: a hernia characterized by chronic groin pain in athletes and a dilated [[superficial inguinal ring]].
*Velpeau hernia: a hernia in the groin in front of the femoral blood vessels

===Characteristics===
Hernias can be classified according to their anatomical location:

Examples include:
* abdominal hernias
* diaphragmatic hernias and [[hiatal hernia]]s (for example, paraesophageal hernia of the stomach)
* pelvic hernias, for example, [[obturator hernia]]
* anal hernias
* hernias of the [[nucleus pulposus]] of the intervertebral discs
* intracranial hernias
* [[Spigelian hernia]] <ref>{{cite journal |author=Bittner JG, Edwards MA, Shah MB, MacFadyen BV, Mellinger JD |title=Mesh-free laparoscopic spigelian hernia repair |journal=Am Surg |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=713–20; discussion 720 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18705572 |doi= |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0003-1348&volume=74&issue=8&spage=713&aulast=Bittner%20JG}}
</ref>

Each of the above hernias may be characterized by several aspects:
*congenital or acquired: congenital hernias occur prenatally or in the first year(s) of life, and are caused by a congenital defect, whereas acquired hernias develop later on in life. However, this may be on the basis of a locus minoris resistantiae (Lat. place of least resistance) that is congenital, but only becomes symptomatic later in life, when degeneration and increased stress (for example, increased abdominal pressure from coughing in [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]]) provoke the hernia.
*complete or incomplete: for example, the stomach may partially or completely herniate into the chest.
* internal or external: external ones herniate to the outside world, whereas internal hernias protrude from their normal compartment to another (for example, mesenteric hernias).
*intraparietal hernia: hernia that does not reach all the way to the [[subcutis]], but only to the musculoaponeurotic layer. An example is a [[Spigelian hernia]]. Intraparietal hernias may produce less obvious bulging, and may be less easily detected on clinical examination.
*bilateral: in this case, simultaneous repair may be considered, sometimes even with a giant prosthetic reinforcement.
*irreducible: the hernial contents cannot be returned to their normal site with simple manipulation.

If irreducible, hernias can develop several complications (hence, they can be complicated or uncomplicated):
*strangulation: pressure on the hernial contents may compromise blood supply (especially veins, with their low pressure, are sensitive, and venous congestion often results) and cause ischemia, and later [[necrosis]] and [[gangrene]], which may become fatal.
*obstruction: for example, when a part of the bowel herniates, bowel contents can no longer pass the obstruction. This results in cramps, and later on vomiting, [[ileus]], absence of [[flatus]] and absence of defecation.
*dysfunction: another complication arises when the herniated organ itself, or surrounding organs, start to malfunction (for example, sliding hernia of the stomach causing heartburn, [[spinal disc herniation|lumbar disc hernia]] causing [[sciatic nerve]] pain, etc.).

==Treatment==
{{Main|Hernia repair|Inguinal hernia surgery}}
[[File:US Navy 081117-N-1512O-119 Lt. Christie Quietmeyer performs hernia repair surgery with the aid of Lt. Craig Fossee and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Zack Mikesell.jpg|thumb|[[Hernia repair]] being performed aboard the amphibious assault ship [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS ''Bataan'']].]]

For a hernia like [[inguinal hernia]], surgery is no longer recommended in most cases. However, it is in few cases advisable to repair some other kinds of hernias, in order to prevent complications such as organ dysfunction, [[gangrene]] and [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]]. Most abdominal hernias can be surgically repaired, but surgery often has complications, such as [[inguinodynia|chronic groin pain]]. Time needed for recovery after treatment is greatly reduced if hernias are operated on [[laparoscopy|laparoscopically]], the minimally invasive operation most commonly used today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herniasymptoms.blogsavy.com/hernia-surgery/|title=Hernia Surgery|publisher=Hernia Symptoms|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>  Uncomplicated hernias are principally repaired by pushing back, or "reducing", the herniated tissue, and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue (an operation called [[Hernia repair|herniorrhaphy]]). If complications have occurred, the surgeon will check the viability of the herniated organ, and resect it if necessary. 

Muscle reinforcement techniques often involve synthetic materials (a [[Inguinal_hernia_repair#Meshes|mesh prosthesis]]). The mesh is placed either over the defect (anterior repair) or under the defect (posterior repair). At times staples are used to keep the mesh in place. These [[Inguinal hernia repair#Mesh repairs|mesh repair methods]] are often called "tension free" repairs because, unlike some suture methods (e.g. Shouldice), muscle is not pulled together under tension. However, this widely used terminology is misleading, as there also exists many [[Inguinal_hernia_repair#Tension-free_repairs|tension-free suture methods]] that do not use mesh (e.g. Desarda, Guarnieri, Lipton-Estrin...). 

Evidence suggests that tension-free methods (with or without mesh) often have lower percentage of recurrences and the fastest recovery period compared to [[Inguinal_hernia_repair#Tension_repairs|tension suture methods]]. However, among other possible complications, prosthetic mesh usage seems to have a higher incidence of [[inguinodynia|chronic pain]] and, sometimes, infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sohail MR, Smilack JD |title=Hernia repair mesh-associated ''Mycobacterium goodii'' infection |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=2858–60 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15184492 |pmc=427896 |doi=10.1128/JCM.42.6.2858-2860.2004 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15184492}}</ref> 

One study attempted to identify the factors related to mesh infections and found that compromised immune systems (such as diabetes) was a factor.{{dead link|date=April 2012}}<ref>[http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~AewAWy90g.DiQX]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> Mesh has also become the subject of recalls and class action lawsuits.{{dead link|date=April 2012}}<ref>[http://www.usdrugrecall.com/category/kugel-hernia-patch-recall]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> 

Laparoscopic surgery is also referred to as "minimally invasive" surgery, which requires one or more small incisions for the camera and instruments to be inserted, as opposed to traditional "open" or "microscopic" surgery, which requires an incision large enough for the surgeon's hands to be inserted into the patient. The term microscopic surgery refers to the magnifying devices used during open surgery.

Many patients are managed through day surgery centers, and are able to return to work within a week or two, while intensive activities are prohibited for a longer period. Patients who have their hernias repaired with mesh often recover in a number of days, though pain can last longer, and often [[inguinodynia|forever]]. Surgical complications have been estimated to be more than 20 percent. They include chronic pain, surgical site infections, nerve and blood vessel injuries, injury to nearby organs, and hernia recurrence.

Due to surgical risks, mainly [[inguinodynia|chronic pain]] risk, the use of external devices to maintain reduction of the hernia without repairing the underlying defect (such as hernia [[Truss (medicine)|trusses]], trunks, belts, etc.) are often used. In particular, we can mention uncomplicated [[incisional hernia]]s that arise shortly after the operation (should only be operated after a few months), or inoperable patients. There have been known cases where hiatal and esophageal hernias have shown signs of improvements after the patient stopped producing stress on the affected  area  by fasting or parenteral nutrition.
It is essential that the hernia not be further irritated by carrying out strenuous labour.

== Complications ==
Complications may arise post-operation, including rejection of the mesh that is used to repair the hernia. In the event of a mesh rejection, the mesh will very likely need to be removed. Mesh rejection can be detected by obvious, sometimes localised swelling and pain around the mesh area. Continuous discharge from the scar is likely for a while after the mesh has been removed.

A surgically treated hernia can lead to [[inguinodynia|complications]], while an untreated hernia may be complicated by:
* [[Inflammation]]
* [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|Irreducibility]]
* [[Bowel obstruction|Obstruction]] of any lumen, such as [[bowel obstruction]] in intestinal hernias
* [[Strangulating|Strangulation]]
* [[Hydrocele]] of the hernial sac
* [[Haemorrhage]]
* [[Autoimmune]] problems
*''Incarceration'', which is where it cannot be reduced, or pushed back into place,<ref name=WashingtonSurgery2008>{{cite book |author=Trudie A Goers; Washington University School of Medicine Department of Surgery; Klingensmith, Mary E; Li Ern Chen; Sean C Glasgow |title=The Washington manual of surgery |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7447-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> at least not without very much external effort.<ref>[http://onlinedictionary.datasegment.com/word/incarcerated onlinedictionary.datasegment.com > incarcerated] Citing: Webster 1913</ref> In intestinal hernias, this also substantially increases the risk of bowel obstruction and strangulation.
