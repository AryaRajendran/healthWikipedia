'''Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever''' (commonly abbreviated as '''HIDS''') is a [[periodic fever syndrome]] originally described in 1984 by the [[internist]] [[Jos van der Meer|Prof. Jos van der Meer]],<ref name="pmid6144826">{{cite journal |author=van der Meer JW, Vossen JM, Radl J, ''et al.'' |title=Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever: a new syndrome |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8386 |pages=1087–90 |year=1984 |month=May |pmid=6144826 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(84)92505-4|url=}}</ref> then at [[Leiden University]] [[Leiden University Medical Centre|Medical Centre]]. No more than 300 cases have been described worldwide.

==Features==
HIDS is one of a number of [[periodic fever syndrome]]s. It is characterised by attacks of [[fever]], [[arthralgia]], [[skin disease|skin lesions]] including cyclical mouth ulcers, and [[diarrhea]]. Laboratory features include an [[acute phase response]] (elevated [[C-reactive protein|CRP]] and [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]]) and markedly elevated [[IgD]] (and often [[IgA]]), although cases with normal IgD have been described.<ref name=Drenth>{{cite journal |author=Drenth JP, van der Meer JW |title=Hereditary periodic fever |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=345 |issue=24 |pages=1748–57 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11742050 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra010200}}</ref>

It has mainly been described in the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], although the international registry includes a number of cases from other countries.<ref name=Drenth/>

The [[differential diagnosis]] includes [[fever of unknown origin]], [[familial Mediterranean fever]] (FMF) and [[TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome|familial Hibernian fever]] (or TNFα reception associated periodic syndrome/TRAPS).<ref name=Drenth/>

==Cause==
Virtually all patients with the syndrome have mutations in the [[gene]] for [[mevalonate kinase]], which is part of the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]], an important cellular [[metabolic pathway]].<ref name="pmid10369262">{{cite journal |author=Drenth JP, Cuisset L, Grateau G, ''et al.'' |title=Mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase cause hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome. International Hyper-IgD Study Group |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=178–81 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10369262 |doi=10.1038/9696 }}</ref><ref name="pmid10369261">{{cite journal |author=Houten SM, Kuis W, Duran M, ''et al.'' |title=Mutations in MVK, encoding mevalonate kinase, cause hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=175–7 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10369261 |doi=10.1038/9691 }}</ref> Indeed, similar fever attacks (but normal IgD) have been described in patients with [[mevalonic aciduria]] - an [[inborn error of metabolism]] now seen as a severe form of HIDS.<ref name=Drenth/>

==Pathophysiology==
It is not known how mevalonate kinase mutations cause the febrile episodes, although it is presumed that other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathyway, the [[prenylation]] chains ([[geranylgeraniol]] and [[farnesol]]) might play a role.<ref name=Drenth/>

==Therapy==
The recurring fevers are highly unpleasant for patients, but so far only the immunosuppressant drugs [[etanercept]]{{Fact|date=March 2009}} (Enbrel) and [[anakinra]]<ref name="pmid16871408">{{cite journal |author=Rigante D, Ansuini V, Bertoni B, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment with anakinra in the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D/periodic fever syndrome |journal=Rheumatol.

[[Statin]] drugs might decrease the level of mevalonate and are presently being investigated.
