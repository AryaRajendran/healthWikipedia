'''Hemotoxins''', '''haemotoxins''' or '''hematotoxins''' are [[toxin]]s  that destroy [[red blood cell]]s (that is, cause [[hemolysis]]), disrupt [[blood]] [[thrombus|clotting]], and/or cause [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] degeneration and generalized [[Biological tissue|tissue]] damage. The term ''hemotoxin'' is to some degree a [[misnomer]] since toxins that damage the blood also damage other tissues. Injury from a hemotoxic agent is often very painful and can cause permanent damage and in severe cases death. Loss of an affected limb is possible even with prompt treatment.

Hemotoxins are frequently employed by [[venom (poison)|venomous]] animals, including [[Viperidae|viper]]s and [[Crotalinae|pit viper]]s. Animal venoms contain [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s that are hemotoxic or [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] or occasionally both (as in the [[Crotalus scutulatus|Mojave Rattlesnake]], the [[Gloydius blomhoffii|Japanese mamushi]],<ref name=igari>Igari R, Iseki K, Abe S, Syoji M, Sato M, Shimomura K, Hayashida A, Sugiura A, Iwashita Y, Midorikawa S. 2010. Binocular diplopia and ptosis due to snakebite (''Agkistrodon blomhoffi'' "mamushi")&nbsp;— a case report. ''Brain Nerve''. Mar;'''62'''(3):273-277.</ref> and similar species). In addition to killing the prey, part of the function of a hemotoxic venom for some animals is to aid digestion. The venom breaks down protein in the region of the bite, making prey easier to digest.

The process by which a hemotoxin causes death is much slower than that of a [[neurotoxin]].  Snakes which envenomate a prey animal may have to track the prey as it flees.  Typically, a mammalian prey item will stop fleeing not because of death, but due to shock caused by the venomous bite.  Dependent upon species, size, location of bite and the amount of venom injected, symptoms in humans such as nausea, disorientation, and headache may be delayed for several hours.

Hemotoxins are used in [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] studies of the [[coagulation]] system. [[Antiphospholipid syndrome|Lupus anticoagulans]] is detected by changes in the [[dilute Russell's viper venom time]] (DRVVT), which is a [[laboratory]] assay based on—as its name indicates—venom of the [[Daboia|Russell's viper]].
