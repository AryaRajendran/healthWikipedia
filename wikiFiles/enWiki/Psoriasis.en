'''Psoriasis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|ɵ|ˈ|r|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɨ|s}}) is an [[immune-mediated disease]] that affects the skin. It is typically a lifelong condition.  There is currently no cure, but various treatments can help to control the symptoms.<ref name="Johnson 166–72">{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=MA|coauthors=Armstrong, AW|title=Clinical and histologic diagnostic guidelines for psoriasis: a critical review.|journal=Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology|date=2013 Apr|volume=44|issue=2|pages=166–72|pmid=22278173}}</ref><ref name="Jobling R 2007 953–4">{{Cite journal|author=Jobling R|title=A patient's journey:Psoriasis|journal=Br Med J|year=2007|volume=334|pages=953–4|doi=10.1136/bmj.39184.615150.802|pmc=1865393|pmid=17478850|issue=7600}}</ref>

Psoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakes a normal skin cell for a pathogen, and sends out faulty signals that cause overproduction of new skin cells. Psoriasis is not contagious.<ref>{{cite web |title=Learn: About psoriasis |publisher=[[National Psoriasis Foundation]] |url=http://www.psoriasis.org/netcommunity/about_psoriasis}}</ref>  However, psoriasis has been linked to an increased risk of stroke,<ref>{{cite news |title=Psoriasis Linked to Stroke Risk  |publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14559523 | date=28 August 2011}}</ref> and treating high [[Blood lipids|blood lipid]] levels may lead to improvement.<ref>{{cite pmid|21233693}}</ref>
There are five types of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Psoriasis|url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/dermatology/patient_information/psoriasis.html|author=University of California, Davis, Department of Dermatology|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>   The most common form, plaque psoriasis, is commonly seen as red and white hues of scaly patches appearing on the top first layer of the epidermis (skin).  Some patients, though, have no dermatological signs or symptoms. The name ''[[wikt:psoriasis|psoriasis]]'' (ψωρίασις) is from the [[Greek language]], meaning roughly "itching condition" (''psora'' "itch" + ''-sis'' "action, condition").

In plaque psoriasis, skin rapidly accumulates at these sites, which gives it a silvery-white appearance.  Plaques frequently occur on the skin of the [[Elbow-joint|elbows]] and [[knee]]s, but can affect any area, including the [[scalp]], palms of hands and soles of feet, and [[sex organ|genitals]].  In contrast to [[eczema]], psoriasis is more likely to be found on the [[extensor|outer side]] of the joint.

The [[disease|disorder]] is a chronic recurring condition that varies in severity from minor localized patches to complete body coverage.  [[Nail (anatomy)|Fingernails]] and toenails are frequently affected (psoriatic nail dystrophy) and can be seen as an isolated sign.  Psoriasis can also cause inflammation of the joints, which is known as [[psoriatic arthritis]].  Between 10% and 30% of all people with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis.<ref>{{cite web |author=Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) |title=Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products indicated for the treatment of Psoriasis |date=18 November 2004 |publisher=European Medicines Agency

The cause of psoriasis is not fully understood, but it is believed to have a [[genetics|genetic]] component and local psoriatic changes can be triggered by an injury to the skin known as the [[Koebner phenomenon]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Cox, Neil; White, Gary |title=Diseases of the skin: a color atlas and text |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2000 |isbn=0-7234-3155-8 }}</ref>  Various environmental factors have been suggested as aggravating to psoriasis, including [[oxidative stress]],<ref>{{Cite pmid|19577640}}</ref> [[stress (medicine)|stress]], withdrawal of systemic [[corticosteroid]], as well as other environmental factors, but few have shown statistical significance.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic365.htm#section~clinical see '''causes''']</ref> There are many treatments available, but because of its chronic recurrent nature, psoriasis is a challenge to treat. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate the condition due to the '[[rebound effect]]' of corticosteroids.<ref>url=http://kellypalace61.web.officelive.com/Documents/CorticosteriodAddictionArticle.pdf</ref>

==Classification==
The symptoms of psoriasis can manifest in a variety of forms. Variants include plaque, pustular, guttate, and flexural psoriasis. This section describes each type (with [[ICD|ICD-10]] code<ref>http://web.ilds.org/icd10_list.php?VIEW=1&START_CODE=L40.0&START_EXT=00</ref>).<ref>[http://web.ilds.org/icd10_list.php?VIEW=1&START_CODE=L40.0&START_EXT=00 "Application to dermatology of International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) — ICD sorted by code: L40.000–L41.000"], The International League of Dermatological Societies</ref>

Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing disease of the skin that may be classified into nonpustular and [[pustule|pustular]] types as follows:<ref name="Fitz2">{{cite book |author=Freedberg, Irwin M.; Fitzpatrick, Thomas B. |title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-138076-0 |edition=6th |page=414}}</ref>

===Nonpustular===
*'''Psoriasis vulgaris''' (chronic stationary psoriasis, plaque-like psoriasis)(L40.0) is the most common form of psoriasis. It affects 80 to 90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques.

*'''[[Psoriatic erythroderma]]''' (erythrodermic psoriasis)(L40.85) involves the widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic treatment. This form of psoriasis can be fatal, as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and for the skin to perform barrier functions.<ref>[http://dermnetnz.org/scaly/erythrodermic-psoriasis.html "Erythrodermic psoriasis"], New Zealand Dermatological Society</ref>

===Pustular===
'''Pustular psoriasis''' (L40.1–3, L40.82) appears as raised bumps that are filled with noninfectious pus (pustules). The skin under and surrounding the pustules is red and tender. Pustular psoriasis can be localised, commonly to the hands and feet (palmoplantar pustulosis), or generalised with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body.  Types include:

*[[Generalized pustular psoriasis]] (pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch)
*[[Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris]] (persistent palmoplantar pustulosis, pustular psoriasis of the Barber type, pustular psoriasis of the extremities)
*[[Annular pustular psoriasis]]
*[[Acrodermatitis continua]]
*[[Impetigo herpetiformis]]

=== Other ===
Additional types of psoriasis include:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |edition=10th |pages=191–7}}</ref>
*[[Drug-induced psoriasis]]

*[[Inverse psoriasis]] (flexural psoriasis, inverse psoriasis)(L40.83–4) appears as smooth inflamed patches of skin. It occurs in [[skin fold]]s, particularly around the [[genitals]] (between the thigh and groin), the [[armpit]]s, under an overweight abdomen ([[panniculus]]), and under the [[breasts]] ([[inframammary fold]]). It is aggravated by [[friction]] and [[sweat]], and is vulnerable to [[Mycosis|fungal infection]]s.

*[[Napkin psoriasis]]

*[[Seborrheic-like psoriasis]]

[[Guttate psoriasis]] (L40.4) is characterized by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, teardrop-shaped lesions. These numerous spots of psoriasis appear over large areas of the body, primarily the trunk, but also the limbs and scalp. Guttate psoriasis is often preceded by a [[streptococcal]] infection, typically [[streptococcal pharyngitis]]. The reverse is not true.

[[Psoriatic nails|Nail psoriasis]] (L40.86) produces a variety of changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails. These changes include discolouring under the nail plate, pitting of the nails, lines going across the nails, thickening of the skin under the nail, and the loosening ([[onycholysis]]) and crumbling of the nail.

[[Psoriatic arthritis]] (L40.5) involves joint and [[connective tissue]] [[inflammation]]. Psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint, but is most common in the joints of the fingers and toes. This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as [[dactylitis]]. Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips, knees and spine ([[spondylitis]]). About 10–15% of people who have psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis.

The [[migratory stomatitis]] in the [[oral cavity]] [[mucosa]] and the [[geographic tongue]] that confined to the dorsal and lateral aspects of the [[tongue]] mucosa, are believed to be oral manifestations of psoriasis, as being [[histology|histologically]] identical to cutaneous psoriasis lesions and more prevalent among psoriasis patients,<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962210004883}}</ref> although these conditions are quite common in the non-psoriatic population, affecting 1% to 2.5% of the general population.<ref name="MS" />

===Quality of life===
Severe cases of psoriasis have been shown to affect health-related quality of life to an extent similar to the effects of other chronic diseases, such as [[clinical depression|depression]], [[hypertension]], [[congestive heart failure]] or [[type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sampogna F, Chren MM, Melchi CF, Pasquini P, Tabolli S, Abeni D |title=Age, gender, quality of life and psychological distress in patients hospitalized with psoriasis |journal=Br. J. Dermatol. |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=325–31 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16433804 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06909.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0007-0963&date=2006&volume=154&issue=2&spage=325}}</ref>  Depending on the severity and location of outbreaks, individuals may experience significant physical discomfort and some disability. Itching and pain can interfere with basic functions, such as self-care, [[walking]], and [[sleep]]. Plaques on [[hands]] and [[foot|feet]] can prevent individuals from working at certain occupations, playing some [[sports]], and caring for family members or a home. Plaques on the scalp can be particularly embarrassing, as flaky plaque in the hair can be mistaken for [[dandruff]].

Individuals with psoriasis may also feel self-conscious about their appearance and have a poor self-image that stems from fear of public rejection and psychosexual concerns. Psychological distress can lead to significant [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[social isolation]].

In a 2008 [[National Psoriasis Foundation]] survey of 426 psoriasis sufferers, 71 percent reported the disease was a significant problem in everyday life. More than half reported significant feelings of self-consciousness (63 percent) and embarrassment (58 percent). More than one-third said they avoided social activities and limited dating or intimate interactions.<ref>[http://www.parade.com/health/healthyskin/coping-with-psoriasis.html "Coping With Psoriasis" Parade.com]</ref>

Many tools exist to measure quality of life of patients with psoriasis and other dermatalogical disorders.  Clinical research has indicated individuals often experience a diminished quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhosle MJ, Kulkarni A, Feldman SR, Balkrishnan R |title=Quality of life in patients with psoriasis |journal=Health Qual Life Outcomes |volume=4 |issue= |pages=35 |year=2006 |pmid=16756666 |pmc=1501000 |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-4-35 |url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/4//35}}</ref>  A 2009 study looked at the impact of psoriasis by using interviews with dermatologists and exploring patients viewpoint. It found that in cases of mild and severe psoriasis, itch contributed most to the diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Globe D, Bayliss MS, Harrison DJ |title=The impact of itch symptoms in psoriasis: results from physician interviews and patient focus groups |journal=Health Qual Life Outcomes |volume=7 |issue= |pages=62 |year=2009 |pmid=19580674 |pmc=2717072 |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-7-62 |url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/7//62}}</ref>

According to a study published in 2010 in the [[Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology]], the reliability of a simple six-point Likert scale for self-assessment of pruritus (itching) by patients was validated in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gottlieb A, Feng J, Harrison DJ, Globe D |title=Validation and response to treatment of a pruritus self-assessment tool in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis |journal=J.

It could also allow future studies to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of therapy directed towards itching, with consequent improvement in quality of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=Simple Psoriasis Pruritus Self-Assessment Tool Validated |publisher=Doctors Lounge |url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/index.php/news/pb/14435}}</ref>

===Severity===
[[Image:Distribution of psoriasis severity.svg|thumb|Distribution of severity among people with psoriasis]]
Psoriasis is usually graded as mild (affecting less than 3% of the body), moderate (affecting 3–10% of the body) or severe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healblog.net/psoriasis |title=Psoriasis Symptoms & Treatment |accessdate=2012-08-27 }}</ref> Several scales exist for measuring the severity of psoriasis. The degree of severity is generally based on the following factors: the proportion of body surface area affected; disease activity (degree of plaque redness, thickness and scaling); response to previous therapies; and the impact of the disease on the person.

The [[Psoriasis Area Severity Index]] (PASI) is the most widely used measurement tool for psoriasis. PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skinandaging.com/article/5394 |title=Psoriasis Update -Skin & Aging |accessdate=2007-07-28 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the PASI can be too unwieldy to use outside of trials, which has led to attempts to simplify the index for clinical use.<ref name="pmid15530297">{{Cite journal|author=Louden BA, Pearce DJ, Lang W, Feldman SR |title=A Simplified Psoriasis Area Severity Index (SPASI) for rating psoriasis severity in clinic patients |journal=Dermatol. Online J. |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=7 |year=2004 |pmid=15530297 }}</ref>

==Cause==
The cause of psoriasis is not fully understood. There are two main hypotheses about the process that occurs in the development of the disease. The first considers psoriasis as primarily a disorder of excessive growth and reproduction of skin cells. The problem is simply seen as a fault of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and its [[keratinocytes]]. The second hypothesis sees the disease as being an [[immune-mediated disease|immune-mediated disorder]] in which the excessive reproduction of skin cells is secondary to factors produced by the [[immune system]]. [[T cell]]s (which normally help protect the body against infection) become active, migrate to the [[dermis]] and trigger the release of [[cytokines]] ([[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] TNFα, in particular) which cause inflammation and the rapid production of skin cells. It is not known what initiates the activation of the T cells.

The immune-mediated model of psoriasis has been supported by the observation that [[immunosuppressant]] medications can clear psoriasis plaques. However, the role of the immune system is not fully understood, and it has recently been reported that an [[animal model]] of psoriasis can be triggered in mice lacking T cells.<!--

Psoriasis is a fairly [[idiosyncratic]] disease. The majority of people's experience of psoriasis is one in which it may worsen or improve for no apparent reason. Studies of the factors associated with psoriasis tend to be based on small (usually hospital based) samples of individuals. These studies tend to suffer from representative issues, and an inability to tease out [[causal]] associations in the face of other (possibly unknown) intervening factors. Conflicting findings are often reported. Nevertheless, the first outbreak is sometimes reported following [[stress (medicine)|stress]] (physical and mental), skin injury, and [[streptococcal infection]].  Conditions that have been reported as accompanying a worsening of the disease include infections, stress, and changes in season and [[climate]]. Certain medicines, including [[lithium salt]], [[beta blocker]]s and the [[antimalarial drug]] chloroquine have been reported to trigger or aggravate the disease. Excessive alcohol consumption, smoking and obesity may exacerbate psoriasis or make the management of the condition difficult or perhaps these comorbidities are effects rather than causes.<ref>[http://www.skincarephysicians.com/psoriasisnet/triggers.html Psoriasis Triggers] at Psoriasis Net.

Psoriasis occurs more likely in dry skin than oily or well-moisturized skin, and specifically after an external skin injury such as a scratch or cut (see [[Koebner phenomenon]]). This is believed to be caused by an infection, in which the infecting organism thrives under dry skin conditions with minimal skin oil, which otherwise protects skin from infections. The case for psoriasis is opposite to the case of [[athlete's foot]], which occurs because of a fungus infection under wet conditions as opposed to dry in psoriasis. This infection induces inflammation, which causes the symptoms commonly associated with psoriasis, such as itching and rapid skin turnover, and leads to drier skin, as the infecting organism absorbs the moisture that would otherwise go to the skin. To prevent dry skin and reduce psoriasis symptoms, it is advised to not use shower scrubs, as they not only damage skin by leaving tiny scratches, but they also scrape off the naturally occurring skin oil. Additionally, moisturizers can be applied to moisturize the skin, and lotions used to promote skin oil gland functions.{{Citation needed|reason=most of the references to this connection on the Internet seem to be commercial|date=December 2008}}

===Genetics===
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
Psoriasis has a large hereditary component, and many genes are associated with it, but it is not clear how those genes work together. Most of them involve the immune system, particularly the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) and [[T cells]]. The main value of genetic studies is they identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential drug targets.<ref name=Nestle>{{cite journal |author=Nestle FO, Kaplan DH, Barker J |title=Psoriasis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=361 |issue=5 |pages=496–509 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19641206 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0804595 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/5/496}} Review article: Mechanisms of Disease.</ref>

Classic genomewide linkage analysis has identified nine locations (loci) on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 ([[PSORS1]] through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes. Many of those genes are on pathways that lead to inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis.<ref name=Nestle/>

The major determinant is PSORS1, which probably accounts for 35–50% of its heritability. It controls genes that affect the immune system or encode proteins that are found in the skin in greater amounts in psoriasis. PSORS1 is located on [[chromosome 6]] in the [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]], which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the PSORS1 locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6, which encodes a MHC class I protein; [[CCHCR1]], variant WWC, which encodes a coiled protein that is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and CDSM, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, which is expressed in the granular and [[cornified layer]]s of the epidermis and upregulated in psoriasis.<ref name=Nestle/>

Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes which are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.<ref name=Nestle/>

Two major genes under investigation are [[IL12B]] on chromosome 5q, which expresses interleukin-12B; and [[IL23R]] on chromosome 1p, which expresses the interleukin-23 receptor, and is involved in T cell differentiation. T cells are involved in the inflammatory process that leads to psoriasis.<ref name=Nestle/>

These genes are on the pathway that ends up upregulating tumor necrosis factor-α and [[NF-κB|nuclear factor κB]], two genes that are involved in inflammation.<ref name=Nestle/>

Recently the first gene directly linked to psoriasis has been identified. Studies have suggested that a rare mutation in the gene encoding for the [[CARD14]] protein plus an environmental trigger was enough to cause plaque psoriasis (the most common form of psoriasis).<ref name = Jordan1>{{vcite journal|author = Jordan CT, Cao L, Roberson EDO et al. | date = April 19, 2012 | url = http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297%2812%2900157-7 | journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics | title = Rare and common variants in CARD14, encoding an epidermal regulator of NF-kappaB, in psoriasis | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.03.013}}</ref><ref name = Jordan2>{{vcite journal|author = Jordan CT, Cao L, Roberson EDO et al. | date = April 19, 2012 | url = http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297%2812%2900156-5 | journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics | title = PSORS2 is due to mutations in CARD14 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.03.012}}</ref>

In psoriasis, immune cells move from the dermis to the epidermis, where they stimulate skin cells (keratinocytes) to proliferate. Psoriasis does not seem to be a true [[autoimmune disease]].<ref name=Nestle/> In an autoimmune disease, the immune system confuses an outside antigen with a normal body component, and attacks them both. But in psoriasis, the inflammation does not seem to be caused by outside antigens (although DNA does have an immunostimulatory effect). Researchers have identified many of the immune cells involved in psoriasis, and the chemical signals they send to each other to coordinate inflammation. At the end of this process, immune cells, such as [[dendritic cells]] and T cells, move from the [[dermis]] to the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], secreting chemical signals, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6, which cause inflammation, and interleukin-22, which causes keratinocytes to proliferate.<ref name=Nestle/>

The [[immune system]] consists of an [[innate immune system]], and an [[adaptive immune system]].

In the innate system, immune cells have receptors that have evolved to target specific proteins and other antigens which are commonly found on pathogens. In the adaptive immune system, immune cells respond to proteins and other antigens that they may never have seen before, which are presented to them by other cells. The innate system often passes antigens on to the adaptive system. When the immune system makes a mistake, and identifies a healthy part of the body as a foreign antigen, the immune system attacks that protein, as it does in autoimmunity.

In psoriasis, DNA is an inflammatory stimulus. DNA stimulates the receptors on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which produce interferon-α, an immune stimulatory signal (cytokine). In psoriasis, keratinocytes produce antimicrobial peptides. In response to dendritic cells and T cells, they also produce cytokines, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, which signals more inflammatory cells to arrive and produces further inflammation.<ref name=Nestle/>

[[Dendritic cell]]s bridge the innate and adaptive immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells. Certain dendritic cells can produce tumor necrosis factor-α, which calls more immune cells and stimulates more inflammation. Targeted immunotherapy, and psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, reduces the number of dendritic cells.<ref name=Nestle/>

T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis. They are attracted to the epidermis by alpha-1 beta-1 integrin, a signalling molecule on the collagen in the epidermis. Psoriatic T cells secrete interferon-γ and [[interleukin-17]]. Interleukin-17 is also associated with [[interleukin-22]]. Interleukin-22 induces keratocytes to proliferate.<ref name=Nestle/>

One hypothesis is that psoriasis involves a defect in regulatory T cells, and in the regulatory cytokine interleukin-10.<ref name=Nestle/>

==Diagnosis==
A [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin; there are no special blood tests or diagnostic procedures.<ref name="Johnson 166–72"/>  Sometimes, a skin [[biopsy]], or scraping, may be needed to rule out other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed [[rete pegs]] if positive for psoriasis. Another sign of psoriasis is that when the plaques are scraped, one can see pinpoint bleeding from the skin below ([[Auspitz's sign]]).

==Management==
[[Image:Psoriasis treatment ladder.svg|thumb|Schematic of psoriasis treatment ladder]]
There are a number of different treatment options for psoriasis. Typically topical agents are used for mild disease, phototherapy for moderate disease, and systemic agents for severe disease.<ref name=Lancet07>{{cite journal |author=Menter A, Griffiths CE |title=Current and future management of psoriasis |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9583 |pages=272–84 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17658398 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61129-5 }}</ref>

===Topical agents===
Bath solutions (epsom salt) and [[moisturizer]]s, [[mineral oil]], and [[petroleum jelly]] may help soothe affected skin and reduce the dryness which accompanies the build-up of skin on psoriatic plaques. Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turn over, and clear affected skin of plaques. Ointment and creams containing [[coal tar]], [[dithranol]] (anthralin), [[corticosteroid]]s like [[desoximetasone]] (Topicort), [[fluocinonide]], [[vitamin D]]<sub>3</sub> analogues (for example, [[calcipotriol]]), and [[retinoid]]s are routinely used. The use of the [[Finger tip unit]] may be helpful in guiding how much topical treatment to use.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Menter |first=Alan |last2=Gottlieb |first2=Alice |last3=Feldman |first3=Steven R. |last4=Van Voorhees |first4=Abby S. |last5=Leonardi |first5=Craig L. |last6=Gordon |first6=Kenneth B. |last7=Lebwohl |first7=Mark |last8=Koo |first8=John Y.

Am. Acad. Dermatol.]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=643–659 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.12.032 }}</ref> The [[mechanism of action]] of each is probably different, but they all help to normalise skin cell production and reduce inflammation. Activated vitamin D and its analogues can inhibit skin cell proliferation.

===Phototherapy===
[[Phototherapy]] in the form of [[sunlight]] has long been used effectively for treatment.<ref name=Lancet07/> Wavelengths of 311–313&nbsp;nm are most effective and special lamps have been developed for this application.<ref name=Lancet07/> The exposure time should be controlled to avoid over exposure and burning of the skin. The UVB lamps should have a timer that will turn off the lamp when the time ends. The amount of light used is determined by a person's skin type.<ref name=Lancet07/> Increased rates of cancer from treatment appear to be small.<ref name=Lancet07/>

[[Psoralen]] and ultraviolet A phototherapy ([[PUVA]]) combines the oral or topical administration of psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The [[mechanism of action]] of PUVA is unknown, but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin.  There are multiple mechanisms of action associated with PUVA, including effects on the skin immune system.

PUVA is associated with [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], burning, and itching. Long-term treatment is associated with [[squamous cell carcinoma]] (but not with [[melanoma]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Systemic agents===
[[Image:Psoriasis infliximab ar1182-2.gif|thumb|Pictures of a patient with psoriasis (and [[psoriatic arthritis]]) at baseline and 8 weeks after initiation of [[infliximab]] therapy.]]
Psoriasis that is resistant to [[topical|topical treatment]] and [[light therapy|phototherapy]] is treated by [[medication]]s taken internally by [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]] or [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] (systemic). Patients undergoing systemic treatment are required to have regular [[Blood test|blood]] and [[liver function tests]] because of the [[toxicity]] of the [[medication]]. [[Pregnancy]] must be avoided for the majority of these treatments. Most people experience a recurrence of psoriasis after systemic treatment is discontinued.

The three main traditional systemic treatments are [[methotrexate]], [[cyclosporine]] and [[retinoids]]. Methotrexate and cyclosporine are [[immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressant]] drugs; retinoids are synthetic forms of [[vitamin A]].  Patients taking methotrexate are prone to ulcerations. Methotrexate exposure may contribute to post-surgical events.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conte H, Ezzedine K, Jouary T, Hubiche T, Taieb A, Milpied B |title=Eventration caused by methotrexate in a psoriatic patient |journal=J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=76–7 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=19453786 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2009.03269.x }}</ref>

A fourth oral agent, [[fumaric acid]] esters (FAE) (brand name Fumaderm®, main active ingredient [[Dimethyl fumarate|dimethyl fumarate (DMF)]]) is approved only in Germany but widely used in Europe due to its unique immunemodulatory properties without significant immunosuppression which makes it suitable for long-term treatment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joanne McEntee|title=Fumaderm®: what is the evidence for its efficacy and safety|url=http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/Download/?file=MDs1MTQwNDU7L3VwbG9hZC9kb2N1bWVudHMvRXZpZGVuY2UvTWVkaWNpbmVzIFEgJmFtcDthbXA7IEEvMjQ2LjJfRnVtYWRlcm1fMjAxMV91cGRhdGUuZG9j.doc|publisher=UK Medicines Information (UKMi) pharmacists for NHS healthcare professionals|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

[[biologic medical product|Biologics]] are manufactured proteins that interrupt the immune process involved in psoriasis. Unlike generalised [[immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressant]] therapies such as methotrexate, biologics focus on specific aspects of the immune function leading to psoriasis. These drugs (interleukin antagonists) are relatively new, and their long-term impact on immune function is unknown, but they have proven effective in treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.   Biologics are usually given by self-injection or in a doctor's office. In the United Kingdom in 2005, the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) published guidelines for use of biological interventions in psoriasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith CH, Anstey AV, Barker JN, ''et al.'' |title=British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for use of biological interventions in psoriasis 2005 |journal=Br. J. Dermatol. |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=486–97 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16120132 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06893.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0007-0963&date=2005&volume=153&issue=3&spage=486}}</ref>  A UK national register called the BAD Biological Register (BADBIR) has been set up to collect valuable information on side effects and benefits and will be used to inform doctors on how best to use biological agents and similar drugs.

Two drugs that target T cells are [[efalizumab]] and [[alefacept]]. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody which blocks the molecules that [[dendritic cells]] use to communicate with [[T cells]]. It also blocks the adhesion molecules on the [[endothelial]] cells that line blood vessels, which attract T cells. However, it suppressed the immune system's ability to control normally harmless viruses, which led to fatal brain infections. Efalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in April, 2009 by the manufacturer. Alefacept also blocks the molecules that dendritic cells use to communicate with T cells and even causes natural killer cells to kill T cells as a way of controlling inflammation.<ref name=Nestle/>

Several [[monoclonal antibodies]] (MAbs) target [[cytokines]], the molecules that cells use to send inflammatory signals to each other. [[tumor necrosis factor α|TNF-α]] is one of the main executor inflammatory cytokines.  Four MAbs ([[infliximab]], [[adalimumab]], [[golimumab]] and [[certolizumab pegol]]) and one recombinant TNF-α [[decoy receptor]], [[etanercept]], have been developed against TNF-α to inhibit TNF-α signaling.  Additional monoclonal antibodies have been developed against pro-inflammatory cytokines [[Interleukin-12|IL-12]]/[[Interleukin-23|IL-23]] and [[Interleukin-17]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hueber W, Patel DD, Dryja T, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of AIN457, a fully human antibody to interleukin-17A, on psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and uveitis |journal=Sci Transl Med |volume=2 |issue=52 |pages=52ra72 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20926833 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001107 }}</ref> and inhibit the inflammatory pathway at a different point than the anti-TNF-α antibodies.<ref name=Nestle/>   IL-12 and IL-23 share a common domain, p40, which is the target of the recently FDA-approved [[ustekinumab]].  Ustekinumab ([[Interleukin 12|IL-12]]/[[Interleukin 23|IL-23]] blocker) was shown to have higher efficacy than high-dose etanercept over a 12-week period in patients with psoriasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffiths CE, Strober BE, van de Kerkhof P, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of ustekinumab and etanercept for moderate-to-severe psoriasis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=362 |issue=2 |pages=118–28 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20071701 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0810652 }}</ref>

In 2008, the FDA approved three new treatment options<ref>[http://www.parade.com/health/healthyskin/psoriasis-medical-breakthroughs.html "Psoriasis Medical Breakthroughs" Parade.com]</ref> available to psoriasis patients: 1) Taclonex Scalp, a new topical ointment for treating scalp psoriasis; 2) the Xtrac Velocity excimer laser system, which emits a high-intensity beam of ultraviolet light, can treat moderate to severe psoriasis; and 3) the biologic drug [[adalimumab]] (brand name Humira) was also approved to treat moderate to severe psoriasis. Adalimumab had already been approved to treat psoriatic arthritis. The most recent biologic drug that has been approved to treat moderate to severe psoriasis, as of 2010, is [[ustekinumab]] (brand name Stelara).

Medications with the least potential for adverse reactions are preferentially employed. If the treatment goal is not achieved, then therapies with greater potential [[toxicity]] may be used. Medications with significant toxicity are reserved for severe unresponsive psoriasis. This is called the psoriasis treatment ladder.<!--
  --><ref name=Lofholm>{{Cite journal|author=Lofholm PW |title=The psoriasis treatment ladder: a clinical overview for pharmacists |journal=US Pharm |year=2000 |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=26–47 |url=http://www.uspharmacist.com/oldformat.asp?url=newlook/files/Feat/apr00pro.cfm&pub_id=8&article_id=511}}</ref> As a first step, medicated [[ointment]]s or creams, called topical treatments, are applied to the skin. If topical treatment fails to achieve the desired goal, then the next step would be to expose the skin to [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation. This type of treatment is called [[phototherapy]]. The third step involves the use of medications which are taken internally by pill or [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. This approach is called systemic treatment.

A 2010 meta-analysis compares the change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement from baseline in 22 trials. The combination therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis using psoralen with ultraviolet A (PUVA) plus acitretin shows a 97.3% PASI improvement from baseline. Therapy limitations need to be taken into consideration in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, such as the increased risk of skin cancer with phototherapy and birth defects with acitretin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hankin CS, Bhatia ND, Goldenberg G, ''et al.'' |title=A Comparison of the Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Treatments for Moderate to Severe Psoriasis |journal=Drug Benefit Trends |volume=21 |pages=17–27 |year=2010 |url=http://dbt.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145628/1524557}}</ref>

===Alternative therapy===
Some studies suggest psoriasis symptoms can be relieved by changes in diet and lifestyle.  Fasting periods, low energy
diets and vegetarian diets have improved psoriasis symptoms in some studies and diets supplemented with [[fish oil]] (in this study [[cod liver oil]]) have also shown beneficial
effects – though evidence is still inconclusive and more research is needed to determine whether there is any benefit from diet manipulations.<ref name=Wolters05>{{Cite journal|author=Wolters M|title=Diet and psoriasis: experimental data and clinical evidence|journal=[[British Journal of Dermatology|Br J Dermatol]]|volume=153|issue=4|pages=706–714|year=2005|month=October|pmid=16181450 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/514108|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06781.x}}</ref> Fish oils are rich in the two [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and contain [[vitamin E]], furthermore cod liver oil contains [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin D]].

It has been suggested that [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] might treat psoriasis, due to the anti-inflammatory properties of its [[cannabinoids]], and their regulatory effects on the immune system.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Namazi MR |title=Cannabinoids, loratadine and allopurinol as novel additions to the antipsoriatic ammunition |journal=J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=319–22 |year=2005 |pmid=15857457 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.01184.x}}</ref> The adverse effects of cannabis might be avoided with a topical preparation or by the use of (a) more specific endocannabinoid receptor agonist(s),<ref name="pmid16375686">{{Cite journal|author=Fowler CJ |title=Pharmacological properties and therapeutic possibilities for drugs acting upon endocannabinoid receptors |journal=Current drug targets.

==Prognosis==
Psoriasis is typically a lifelong condition.  There is currently no cure, but various treatments can help to control the symptoms.<ref name="Jobling R 2007 953–4"/> Many of the most effective agents used to treat severe psoriasis carry an increased risk of significant morbidity including [[skin cancer]]s, [[lymphoma]] and liver disease. However, the majority of people's experience of psoriasis is that of minor localized patches, particularly on the elbows and knees, which can be treated with topical medication. Psoriasis can get worse over time, but it is not possible to predict who will go on to develop extensive psoriasis or those in whom the disease may appear to vanish. Individuals will often experience flares and remissions throughout their lives.  Controlling the signs and symptoms typically requires lifelong therapy.

According to one study,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Olsen JH, Frentz G, Møller H |title=[Psoriasis and cancer] |language=Danish |journal=Ugeskr. Laeg. |volume=155 |issue=35 |pages=2687–91 |year=1993 |pmid=8212383 }}</ref> psoriasis is linked to 2.5-fold increased risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer in men and women, with no preponderance of any specific histologic subtype of cancer. This increased risk could also be attributed to antipsoriatic treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Psoriasis affects both [[sex]]es equally, and can occur at any [[ageing|age]], although it most commonly appears for the first time between the ages of 15 and 25 years.

The [[prevalence]] of psoriasis in Western populations is estimated to be around 2–3%. The prevalence of psoriasis among 7.5 million patients who were registered with a general practitioner in the United Kingdom was 1.5%.<!--

Around one-third of people with psoriasis report a [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of the disease, and researchers have identified genetic [[locus (genetics)|loci]] associated with the condition. Studies of [[twin|monozygotic twins]] suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has psoriasis. The [[concordance (genetics)|concordance]] is around 20% for [[twin|dizygotic twins]]. These findings suggest both a genetic predisposition and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.<!--

Prevalence across different racial groups is similar; race does not appear to be a risk factor.<ref name=CDCrecords/>

Onset before age 40 usually indicates a greater genetic susceptibility and a more severe or recurrent course of psoriasis.

==History==
Some scholars believe psoriasis to have been included among the skin conditions called ''[[tzaraath|tzaraat]]'' in the [[Hebrew Bible]], defined by [[chazal]] as the result of talking [[lashon hara]] (slander).  The patient deemed "impure" (see [[tumah and taharah]]) during their afflicted phase and is ultimately treated by the [[kohen]].<ref name=Shai>{{Cite journal|author=Shai A, Vardy D, Zvulunov A |title=[Psoriasis, biblical afflictions and patients' dignity] |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=479–82, 496 |year=2002 |pmid=12073533 }}</ref> In more recent times psoriasis was frequently described as a variety of [[leprosy]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Greeks used the term lepra (λεπρα) for scaly skin conditions. They used the term psora to describe itchy skin conditions. It became known as ''Willan's lepra'' in the late 18th century when English [[dermatologist]]s [[Robert Willan]] and Thomas Bateman differentiated it from other skin diseases. Leprosy, they said, is distinguished by the regular, circular form of patches, while psoriasis is always irregular. Willan identified two categories: ''leprosa graecorum'' and ''psora leprosa''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meenan FO |title=A note on the history of psoriasis |journal=Ir J Med Sci |issue=351 |pages=141–2 |year=1955 |month=March |pmid=14353580 }}</ref>

It was not until 1841 that the condition was finally given the name ''psoriasis'' by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] dermatologist [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra|Ferdinand von Hebra]]. The name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''psora'' which means ''to itch''.<!--

It was during the 20th century that psoriasis was further differentiated into specific types.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Historical treatment===
{{Original research|date=June 2011}}
The history of psoriasis is littered with treatments of dubious effectiveness and high toxicity. These treatments received brief popularity at particular time periods or within certain geographical regions. The application of [[cat]] [[faeces]] to red lesions on the skin, for example, was one of the earliest topical treatments employed in ancient [[Egypt]]. Onions, sea salt and [[urine]], goose oil and [[semen]], wasp droppings in [[sycamore]] milk, and soup made from [[Viperidae|viper]]s have all been reported as being ancient treatments.

In the more recent past, [[Fowler's solution]], which contains a [[poisonous]] and [[carcinogenic]] [[arsenic]] compound, was used by dermatologists as a treatment for psoriasis during the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Grenz rays]] (also called ultrasoft X-rays or Bucky rays) was a popular treatment of psoriasis during the middle of the 20th century.  This type of therapy was superseded by ultraviolet therapy.

[[Undecylenic acid]] was investigated and used for psoriasis some 40 years ago (circa 1950).<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Ereaux L, Craig G | title=The Oral Administration Of Undecylenic Acid In The Treatment Of Psoriasis | journal=Canad.

All these treatments have fallen out of favour.

Sulphur was fashionable as a treatment for psoriasis in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. It has recently regained some credibility as a safe alternative to steroids and coal tar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Research==
Historically, agents used to treat psoriasis were discovered by experimentation or by accident. In contrast, current novel therapeutic agents are designed from a better understanding of the immune processes involved in psoriasis and by the specific targeting of molecular mediators. Examples can be seen in the use of biologics, which target T cells and TNF inhibitors.

Emerging clinical research has demonstrated the integral role of [[Janus kinase]] (JAK) proteins in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  As of 2010, two new oral [[JAK inhibitor]] drugs, [[ruxolitinib]] and [[tofacitinib]] (formerly called tasocitinib), have shown rapid and promising efficacy in Phase I/II trials with patients showing significant skin clearing within one week of beginning treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mesa RA |title=Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms and psoriasis |journal=IDrugs |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=394–403 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20506062 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Boy MG, Wang C, Wilkinson BE, ''et al.'' |title=Double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the pharmacologic effect of CP-690,550 in patients with psoriasis |journal=J.

Research into [[oligonucleotide|antisense oligonucleotide]]s carries the potential to provide novel therapeutic strategies for treating psoriasis.  Antisense oligonucleotides would be used to down regulate key cellular proteins known to play a role in psoriatic pathogenesis including inflammatory proteins such as [[ICAM-1]] (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), [[Interleukin-2|IL-2]] and [[Interleukin-8|IL-8]], cellular proliferation proteins like [[insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor]] (IGF-IR)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liew SC, Das-Gupta E, Chakravarthi S, ''et al.'' |title=Differential expression of the angiogenesis growth factors in psoriasis vulgaris |journal=BMC Res Notes |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=201 |year=2012 |month=April |pmid=22537619 |doi=10.1186/1756-0500-5-201 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/5/201 |pmc=3392727}}</ref> and [[epidermal growth factor]] and hyperangiogenesis [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF).<!--

A novel boron-containing topical anti-inflammatory, AN2728, is currently being developed by [[Anacor]] Pharmaceuticals and is in Phase 2b trials for mild-to-moderate plaque type psoriasis.<ref>>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01300052}}</ref>  The molecule works by inhibiting PDE4 and reducing the production of TNF-alpha, a precursor of the inflammation associated with psoriasis, as well as other cytokines, including IL-12 and IL-23.

FP187, an oral drug containing [[dimethyl fumarate]], was found to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in a pivotal registration study completed in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Forward Pharma|title=Efficacy and Safety Trial of FP187 in Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01230138|publisher=Clinicaltrials.gov|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Forward Pharma Newsroom|url=http://www.forward-pharma.com/news_room.html|publisher=Forward Pharma|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> The molecule is thought to work in part through GSH depletion and subsequent induction of the anti-inflammatory stress protein HO-1, leading to depression of inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g. TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-γ).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=JC|coauthors=Lehmann, JC; Listopad, JJ; Rentzsch, CU; Igney, FH; von Bonin, A; Hennekes, HH; Asadullah, K; Docke, WD|title=Dimethylfumarate induces immunosuppression via glutathione depletion and subsequent induction of heme oxygenase 1|journal=J Invest Dermatol.|year=2007|volume=127|issue=4|pages=835–45|pmid=17235328|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17235328}}</ref>

In 2004, Tas and Avci demonstrated [[cyclopamine]]’s clinical potential for the treatment of psoriasis and basal cell carcinoma in two preliminary proof of concept studies.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Tas |first=S. |last2=Avci |first2=O. |title=Rapid clearance of psoriatic skin lesions induced by topical cyclopamine |journal=Dermatology |year=2004 |volume=209 |issue=2 |pages=126–131 |doi=10.1159/000079596 |pmid=15316166 }}</ref> By treating 31 psoriatic lesions in 7 patients, these authors asserted topical cyclopamine was more effective in the clinical and histological clearance of guttate and plaque psoriasis than the topical steroid [[clobetasol-17 propionate]]. Furthermore, they demonstrated concurrent application of cylopamine and clobetasol-17 propionate accelerated regression and clearance of selected lesions greater than cyclopamine alone, with clearance times as early as 48 hours. They assert cyclopamine inhibits the abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells, induces terminal differentiation, and is associated with the
decreased presence of inflammatory cells, including CD41 lymphocytes.

On 27 August 2006, scientists led by Jeung-Hoon Lee created the synthetic lipids pseudoceramides, which are involved in [[skin cell]] growth, and could be used in treating [[skin diseases]] such as [[atopic dermatitis]], a form of [[eczema]]  characterized by red, flaky and very itchy skin; psoriasis, and [[glucocorticoid]]-induced [[epidermal atrophy]], in which the skin shrinks due to skin cell loss.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070827184713.htm Science Daily, New Skin-healing Chemicals]</ref>

The International Federation of Psoriasis Associations (IFPA) is the global umbrella organization for national and regional psoriasis patient associations and also gathers the leading experts in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis research for scientific conferences every three years.<ref>http://www.ifpa-pso.org/</ref> The Psoriasis International Network, a program of the [[Fondation René Touraine]], gathers dermatologists, rheumatologists and other caregivers involved in the management of psoriasis.
