[[Image:Francisco Goya - Casa de locos.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Social alienation]] was one of the main themes in [[Francisco Goya]]'s masterpieces, such as ''[[The Madhouse]]'' (above).]]
The story of the rise of the '''lunatic asylum''' and its gradual transformation into, and eventual replacement by, the modern [[psychiatric hospital]], is also the story of the rise of organized, institutional [[psychiatry]]. While there were earlier institutions that housed the 'insane,' the arrival at the answer of [[institutionalisation]] as the correct solution to the problem of madness was very much an event of the nineteenth century. To illustrate this with one regional example, in England at the beginning of the nineteenth century there were, perhaps, a few thousand "[[lunatic]]s" housed in a variety of disparate institutions but by 1900 that figure had grown to about 100,000. That this growth should coincide with the growth of [[psychiatry|alienism]], later known as psychiatry, as a medical specialism is not coincidental.<ref name="PorterMadmen"/>{{rp|14}}

==Medieval era==
In the Islamic world, the ''[[Bimaristan]]s'' were described by European travelers, who wrote on their wonder at the care and kindness shown to lunatics. In 872, [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] built a hospital in [[Cairo]] that provided care to the insane.<ref name=Koenig>{{cite book|last=Koenig|first=Harold George|title=Faith and mental health: religious resources for healing|year=2005|publisher=Templeton Foundation Press|isbn=1-932031-91-X}}</ref> Nonetheless, medical historian [[Roy Porter]] cautions against idealising the role of hospitals generally in medieval Islam stating that "They were a drop in the ocean for the vast population that they had to serve, and their true function lay in highlighting ideals of compassion and bringing together the activities of the medical profession."<ref name="GreatestBenefit">{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Roy|date=1997|title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Fontana Press|location=London|isbn=0006374549}}</ref>{{rp|105}}

In Europe during the medieval era, a variety of settings were employed to house the small subsection of the population of the mad who were housed in institutional settings. [[Roy Porter|Porter]] gives examples of such locales where some of the insane were cared for, such as in monasteries. A few towns had towers where madmen were kept (called ''Narrentürme'' in German, or "fools' towers"). The ancient Parisian hospital [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|''Hôtel-Dieu'']] also had a small number of cells set aside for lunatics, whilst the town of Elbing boasted a madhouse, ''Tollhaus,'' attached to the Teutonic Knights' hospital.<ref>Gary D. Albrecht, Katherine D.Seelman, Michael Bury: ''Handbook of disability studies'',p.20 [http://books.google.es/books?id=vAKSZPR-hk0C&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=Elbing+madhouse&source=bl&ots=8gge3nJRiu&sig=a0dTRoDk56fU2fqHU7v-rOlb2Ys&hl=es&ei=c37dS-WRMoLC9QSPoKmpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=granada&f=false]</ref>

Other such institutions for the insane were established after the Christian [[Reconquista]], including hospitals in Valencia (1407), Zaragoza (1425), Seville (1436), Barcelona (1481), and Toledo (1483).<ref name="GreatestBenefit"/>{{rp|127}} [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|The Priory of Saint Mary of Bethlehem]], which later became known more notoriously as [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], was founded in 1247.

===England===
====Domestic care====
In England at the beginning of the eighteenth-century the level of specialist institutional provision for the care and control of the insane was extremely limited. Rather, madness was still seen principally as a domestic problem, with families and parish authorities central to regimens of care.<ref name="Suzuki1991Part1">{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 8| pages = 437–56| last = Suzuki| first = Akihito| title = Lunacy, in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century England: Analysis of Quarter Sessions Records Part I| journal = History of Psychiatry| date = 1991}}</ref>{{rp|439}}<ref name="PorterMadmen"/>{{rp|154}} Various forms of outdoor relief were extended by the parish authorities to families in these circumstances including financial support, the provision of parish nurses and, where family care was not possible, lunatics might be 'boarded out' to other members of the local community or committed to private madhouses.<ref name="Suzuki1991Part1"/>{{rp|452–56}}<ref name=AndrewsRise>{{Cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Andrews|chapter=The Rise of the Asylum|publisher=The Open University|isbn=0719067359|location=Manchester|year=2004|title=Medicine Transformed: Health, Disease & Society in Europe, 1800–1930|editors=Deborah Brunton|pages=298–330}}</ref>{{rp|299}} Exceptionally, if those deemed mad were judged to be particularly disturbing or violent, parish authorities might meet the not inconsiderable costs of their confinement in charitable asylums such as [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem]], in Houses of Correction or in workhouses.<ref name="Suzuki1991Part2">{{Cite journal| volume = 3| issue = 8| pages = 29–44| last = Suzuki| first = Akihito| title = Lunacy, in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century England: Analysis of Quarter Sessions Records Part II| journal = History of Psychiatry| date = 1992}}</ref>{{rp|30, 31–35, 39–43}}

{{anchor|Trade in lunacy}}

====The trade in lunacy====
Due, perhaps, to the absence of a centralised state response to the social problem of madness until the nineteenth-century, private madhouses proliferated in eighteenth-century England on a scale unseen elsewhere.<ref name="PorterMadmen"/>{{rp|174}} References to such institutions are limited for the seventeenth-century but it is evident that by the start of the eighteenth-century the so-called 'trade in lunacy' was well established.<ref name="ParryJones">{{cite book|last=Parry-Jones|first=William Ll.|title=The Trade in Lunacy: A Study of Private Madhouses in England in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|location=London|publisher=Routledge|date=1972}}</ref>{{rp|8–9}} [[Daniel Defoe]], an ardent critic of private madhouses,<ref name="NollEncyclopedia">{{cite book|last=Noll|first=Richard|title=The Encyclopedia of Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders|edition=3rd|date=2007|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|ISBN=0816064059}}</ref>{{rp|118}} estimated in 1724 that there were fifteen then operating in the London area.<ref name="MacKenzie">{{cite book | title=Psychiatry for the Rich: A History of Ticehurst Private Asylum | publisher=Routledge | author=MacKenzie, Charlotte | year=1992 | location=London | isbn=0415099917}}</ref>{{rp|9}} Defoe may have exaggerated but exact figures for private metropolitan madhouses are only available from 1774 when [[Madhouses Act 1774|licensing legislation]] was introduced and sixteen institutions were recorded..<ref name="MacKenzie"/>{{rp|9–10}} At least two of these, [[Hoxton]] House and Wood's Close, [[Clerkenwell]], had been in operation since the seventeenth-century.<ref name="MacKenzie"/>{{rp|10}} By 1807, the number had only increased to seventeen.<ref name="MacKenzie"/>{{rp|9}} It is conjectured that this limited growth in the number of London madhouses is likely to reflect the fact that vested interests, especially the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], exercised considerably control in preventing new entrants to the market.<ref name="MacKenzie"/>{{rp|10–11}} Thus, rather than a proliferation of private madhouses in London, existing institutions tended to expand considerably in size.<ref name="MacKenzie"/>{{rp|10}} The establishments which increased most during the eighteenth-century, such as Hoxton House, did so by accepting [[pauperism|pauper]] patients rather than private, middle-class, fee-paying patients.<ref name="MacKenzie"/>{{rp|11}} Significantly, pauper patients, unlike their private counterparts, were not subject to inspection under the [[Madhouses Act 1774|1774 legislation]].<ref name="MacKenzie"/>{{rp|11}}

===United States===

In the United States, the [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] was founded in 1751 as a result of work begun in 1709 by the [[Religious Society of Friends]].  A portion of this hospital was set apart for the mentally ill, and the first patients were admitted in 1752.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|Insane, Institutional Care of the, in the United States|author=[[William Alanson White|William A.

===Moral treatment===

[[Phillipe Pinel]] (1793) is often credited as being the first in Europe to introduce more humane methods into the treatment of the mentally ill (which came to be known as [[moral treatment]]) as the superintendent of the [[Bicêtre Hospital]] in Paris.<ref name=ce/>  Pinel credited his friend [[Jean-Baptiste Pussin]], the Bicêtre's unschooled manager, for removing patient shackles (though he occasionally used straightjackets). Both spread reforms such as categorising disorders, as well as methods of cure based on observing and talking to patients. [[Samuel Hahnemann]], a fellow medical translator now considered the founder of homeopathic medicine, also lived in Paris at the time and advocated humane treatment of the insane.<ref>

[[Benjamin Rush]] of Philadelphia also promoted humane treatment of the insane outside dungeons and without iron restraints, as well as sought their reintegration into society. In 1792 Rush successfully campaigned for a separate ward for the insane at the Pennsylvania Hospital. His talk-based approach led to modern occupational therapy and addiction medicine, although most of his physical approaches have long been discredited, such as bleeding and purging (unlike Pinel), hot and cold baths, mercury pills, a "tranquilizing chair" and gyroscope. In Italy, [[Vincenzo Chiarugi]] may also have banned chains before this time.  [[Johann Jakob Guggenbühl]] in 1840 started in [[Interlaken]] the first retreat for mentally disabled children.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Around the same time as Pussin and Pinel, British [[Quakers]], particularly [[William Tuke]], pioneered an enlightened approach ([[moral treatment]]) at the [[The Retreat|York Retreat]] which opened in 1796. The Retreat was not a psychiatric hospital, and in fact abandoned medical approaches of the day in favor of understanding, hope, moral responsibility and occupational therapy.<ref name="madness_morality_and_medicine">{{Cite book  | last1 = Digby | first1 = Anne | title = Madness, morality, and medicine: a study of the York Retreat, 1796–1914 | year = 1985 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge  | isbn = 0-521-26067-1 | pages =  }}</ref> The Brattleboro Retreat and the former Hartford Retreat were named after it.

==19th century==

===United States===
In 1806 an authorization to a hospital in [[New York City]] was granted to erect additions and provide suitable apartments adapted to the various forms and degrees of mental illness. Other important dates in the early part of the 19th century were: the opening of an institution for the care of the mentally ill at [[Frankfort, Pennsylvania]], by the Society of Friends in 1817, the founding of the [[Hartford Retreat]], in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], in 1824, the opening of the South Carolina State Hospital for the Insane in 1824, of the [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|Eastern State Hospital at Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1824, of the [[Western State Hospital (Virginia)|Western State Hospital]] at [[Staunton, Virginia]], in 1828, of one of the buildings of the Blockley Almshouse for the dependent insane in Philadelphia from 1830 to 1834, the [[Maryland Hospital for the Insane]] in 1832, and the New Hampshire State Hospital for the Insane at [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] in 1842.<ref name=ea/>

From this period on, the erection of state hospitals went rapidly forward in the different states. The first law for the creation of a state hospital in New York was passed in 1842. The [[Utica State Hospital]] was opened approximately in 1850. The creation of this hospital, as of many others, was largely the work of [[Dorothea Lynde Dix]], whose philanthrophic efforts extended over many states, and in [[Europe]] as far as [[Constantinople]]. It was through her efforts that institutions were erected in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode Island, North Carolina and the District of Columbia. According to her biographers, some 30 institutions in the United States owe their existence, in whole or in part, to her efforts.<ref name=ea/>

===Trends===
Reformers such as Dix began to advocate a more humane and progressive attitude towards the mentally ill.  Some were motivated by a Christian duty to mentally ill citizens.  In the United States, for example, the numerous state mental health systems established were paid for by taxpayer money, and often money from the relatives of those institutionalized inside them.  These centralized institutions were often linked with loose governmental bodies, though oversight and quality consequently varied.  They were generally geographically isolated as well, located away from urban areas because the land was cheap and there was less political opposition.

Many state hospitals in the United States were built in the 1850s and 1860s on the [[Kirkbride Plan]], an architectural style meant to have curative effect.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yanni|first=Carla|title=The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States|publisher=Minnesota University Press|location=Minneapolis|year=2007|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fJOC_rSW1kgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false | isbn=978-0-8166-4939-6}}</ref> States made large outlays on architecture that often resembled the palaces of Europe, although operating funding for ongoing programs was more scarce.  Many patients objected to transfers from private hospitals to state facilities.  Some Brattleboro Retreat patients tried to hide when state officials arrived to transfer them to the new Waterbury State Hospital.  This decline in patient census led to the collapse of many private institutions, which still accepted indigent patients even when state reimbursement for private hospitals dropped in the face of rising state hospital costs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In the 1800s middle-class facilities became more common, replacing private care for wealthier persons. However, facilities in this period were largely oversubscribed. Individuals were referred to facilities either by the community or by the criminal justice system. Dangerous or violent cases were usually given precedence for admission. A survey taken in 1891 in [[Cape Town]], South Africa shows the distribution between different facilities. Out of 2046 persons surveryed, 1,281 were in private dwellings, 120 in jails, and 645 in asylua, with men representing nearly two thirds of the number surveyed. In situations of scarcity of accommodation, preference was given to white men and black men (who's insanity threatened white society by disrupting employment relations and the tabooed sexual contact with white women).<ref name="PorterWright2003">{{cite book|author1=Roy Porter|author2=David Wright|title=The Confinement of the Insane: International Perspectives, 1800–1965|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i7ktMJZC_HsC|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=7 August 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80206-2}}</ref>

Defining someone as insane was a necessary prerequisite for being admitted to a facility. A doctor was only called after someone was labelled insane on social terms and had become socially or economically problematic. Until the 1890s, little distinction existed between the lunatic and criminal lunatic. The term was often used to police [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] as well as paupers and the insane. In the 1858–59, the [[Lunacy Panic]] occurred in Victorian England that medical doctors were declaring people "insane" that were actually sane. These people were perhaps awkward or embarrassing to families, thus meriting convenient disposal into asylums. This sensationalism was pronounced in novels such as [[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]].<ref name="PorterWright2003" /><ref>http://bythebrooke.blogspot.com/2008/11/lunacy-panic.html</ref>

===Non-restraint movement===

In [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] ([[Lincolnshire]], England) [[Robert Gardiner Hill]], with the support of Edward Parker Charlesworth, developed a mode of treatment that suited 'all types' of patients, whereby the reliance on mechanical restraints and coercion could be made obsolete altogether – a situation he finally achieved in 1838. By the following year of 1839 Sergeant John Adams and Dr. [[John Conolly]] were so impressed by the work of Hill, that they immediately introduced the method into their [[Hanwell Asylum]], which was by then the largest in the kingdom. The greater size required Hill's system to be developed and refined. This was necessary  as it was beyond Conolly to be able to supervise each attendant as closely as Hill had done. By September 1839, mechanical restraint was no longer required for any patient.<ref name="Suzuki">{{Cite journal

==20th century==

===Radical politics===
In February 1919, the first [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] in the [[British Isles]] was established at [[Monaghan Lunatic Asylum]], in [[Monaghan]], Ireland. This led to the claim by [[Joseph Devlin]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that "that the only successfully conducted institutions in Ireland are the lunatic asylums"<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1919/feb/20/monaghan-lunatic-asylum Hansard], 20 February 1919, accessed 18 July 2010</ref>

===Physical therapies===
A series of radical physical therapies were developed in central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and, most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]]'s malarial therapy for [[general paresis of the insane]] (or [[neurosyphilis]]) first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X0001104403 | author = Brown Edward M | year = 2000 | title = Why Wagner-Jauregg won the Nobel Prize for discovering malaria therapy for General Paresis of the Insane | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 11 | issue = 44| pages = 371–382 }}</ref> This treatment heralded the beginning of a radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum based culture of therapeutic nihilism in the treatment of chronic [[psychiatric disorders]],<ref>Ugo Cerletti, for instance, described psychiatry during the interwar period as a "funereal science". Quoted in Shorter, Edward (1997). ''A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac''. Wiley: p. 218</ref> most particularly [[dementia praecox]] (increasingly known as [[schizophrenia]] from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as [[hereditary]] degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hoenig J | year = 1995 | title = Schizophrenia.

Meduna | url = | journal = Convulsive Therapy | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 53 }}</ref> Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by [[barbiturate]] induced [[deep sleep therapy]] to treat [[dementia praecox]], which was popularized by the Swiss psychiatrist [[Jakob Klaesi]]. In 1933 the Viennese based psychiatrist [[Manfred Sakel]] introduced [[insulin shock therapy]] and in August 1934 [[Ladislas J. Meduna]], a Hungarian neuropathologist and psychiatrist working in [[Budapest]], introduced [[cardiazol]] shock therapy ([[cardiazol]] is the tradename of the chemical compound [[pentylenetetrazol]], known by the tradename [[metrazol]] in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a [[psychiatric disorder]]. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing [[dementia praecox]]. [[Cardiazol]] shock therapy, founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between [[schizophrenia]] and [[epilepsy]] and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist [[Ugo Cerletti]] in 1938.<ref>Shorter, Edward (1997). ''A History of Psychiatry''. Wiley: pp. 190–225.</ref> In 1935 the Portuguese neurologist [[Egas Moniz]] devised the leucotomy, a surgical procedure targeting the brain's frontal lobes. This was shortly thereafter adapted by [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]] and James W. Watts in what is known as Freeman-Watts procedure or the standard prefrontal [[lobotomy]]. From 1946, Freeman developed the transorbital lobotomy, using a device akin to an ice-pick. This was an "office" procedure which did not have to be performed in a surgical theatre and took as little as fifteen minutes to complete. Freeman is credited with the popularisation of the technique in the United States. In 1949, 5074 lobotomies were carried out in the United States and by 1951 18,608 people had undergone the controversial procedure in that country.<ref>Shorter, Edward (1997).''A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac''. Wiley: pp. 226–229.</ref> 

In modern times, insulin shock therapy and lobotomies are viewed as being almost as barbaric as the Bedlam "treatments", although the insulin shock therapy was still seen as the only option which produced any noticeable effect on patients. ECT is still used in the West, but it is seen as a last resort for treatment of mood disorders, and is administered much more safely than in the past.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yanni, Carla. |title=The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States (Architecture, Landscape and Amer Culture) |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |date=12 April 2007 |isbn=978-0-8166-4940-2 |edition=1 |pages=53–62 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fJOC_rSW1kgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>  Elsewhere, particularly in India, use of ECT is reportedly increasing, as a cost-effective alternative to drug treatment. The effect of a shock on an overly excitable patient often allowed these patients to be discharged to their homes, which was seen by administrators (and often guardians) as a preferable solution to institutionalization. Lobotomies were performed in the hundreds from the 1930s to the 1950s, and were ultimately replaced with modern psychotropic drugs.

===Drugs===

The twentieth century saw the development of the first effective [[psychiatric drug]]s.

The first [[neuroleptics|antipsychotic drug]], [[chlorpromazine]] (known under the trade name [[Largactil]] in Europe and [[Thorazine]] in the United States), was first synthesised in France in 1950. [[Pierre Deniker]], a psychiatrist of the Saint-Anne Psychiatric Centre in Paris, is credited with first recognising the specificity of action of the drug in psychosis in 1952. Deniker travelled with a colleague to the United States and Canada promoting the drug at medical conferences in 1954. The first publication regarding its use in North America was made in the same year by the Canadian psychiatrist [[Heinz Lehmann]], who was based in Montreal. Also in 1954 another antipsychotic, [[reserpine]], was first used by an American psychiatrist based in New York, Nathan S. Kline. At a Paris based colloquium on [[neuroleptics]] (antipsychotics) in 1955 a series of psychiatric studies were presented by, among others, [[Hans Hoff]] (Vienna), Aksel{{Who|date=January 2010}} (Istanbul), Felix Labarth (Basle), [[Linford Rees]] (London), Sarro{{Who|date=January 2010}} (Barcelona), [[Manfred Bleuler]] (Zurich), [[William Mayer-Gross]] (Birmingham), Winford{{Who|date=January 2010}} (Washington) and Denber{{Who|date=January 2010}} (New York) attesting to the effective and concordant action of the new drugs in the treatment of psychosis.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The new antipsychotics had an immense impact on the lives of psychiatrists and patients. For instance, [[Henry Ey]], a French psychiatrist at Bonneval, related that between 1921 and 1937 only 6 per cent of patients suffering from schizophrenia and chronic delirium were discharged from his institution. The comparable figure for the period from 1955 to 1967, after the introduction of chlorpromazine, was 67 per cent. Between 1955 and 1968 the residential psychiatric population in the United States dropped by 30 per cent.<ref>Thuillier, Jean (1999). ''Ten Years that Changed the Face of Mental Illness''. Trans. Gordon Hickish. Martin Dunitz: pp. 110,114, 121–123, 130. ISBN 1-85317-886-1</ref> Newly developed [[antidepressants]] were used to treat cases of [[clinical depression|depression]], and the introduction of [[muscle relaxants]] allowed [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] to be used in a modified form for the treatment of severe depression and a few other disorders. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The discovery of the [[mood stabilizing]] effect of [[lithium carbonate]] by [[John Cade]] in 1948 would eventually revolutionize the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]], although its use was banned in the United States until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}<!-- I'm not sure if this is relevant here tbh. The point of this section is to indicate the interaction between neuroleptics and deinstitutionalisation. Given the late arrival of lithium, when that process was well underway, it's hard to see any causal relationship. I might delete this shortly -->

The use of [[psychosurgery]] was narrowed to a very small number of people for specific indications.{{Which|date=January 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  New treatments led to reductions in the number of patients in mental hospitals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} <!-- What is needed here generally is get figures of psych hospital residents for the period somewhat before 1954 and the decades thereafter. Should enable one to see to what degree psych meds precipitated, accelerated, or followed changes in psych hospital populations. Can't find the source atm but I think that in England at least deinstitutionalisation was already in train when chlorpromazine was introduced. -->

=== Country-specific/regional events ===

==== United States: Reform in the 1940s ====
From 1942 to 1947, [[conscientious objectors]] in the US assigned to psychiatric hospitals under [[Civilian Public Service]] exposed abuses throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in reforms of the 1940s and 1950s. The CPS reformers were especially active at the [[Philadelphia State Hospital]] where four [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] initiated ''The Attendant'' magazine as a way to communicate ideas and promote reform. This periodical later became ''The Psychiatric Aide'', a professional journal for mental health workers. On 6 May 1946, ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' magazine printed an exposé of the psychiatric system by [[Albert Q. Maisel]] based on the reports of COs.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BlUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA102|title=Bedlam 1946|author=Albert Q. Maisel|publisher=LIFE magazine|page=102|date=6 May 1946}}</ref> Another effort of CPS, namely the ''Mental Hygiene Project'', became the [[National Mental Health Foundation]]. Initially skeptical about the value of Civilian Public Service, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the mental health system, became a sponsor of ''the National Mental Health Foundation'' and actively inspired other prominent citizens including [[Owen J. Roberts]], [[Pearl Buck]] and [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]] to join her in advancing the organization's objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Deinstitutionalization ===
{{Main|Deinstitutionalization}}
By the beginning of the 20th century, ever-increasing admissions had resulted in serious overcrowding. Funding was often cut, especially during periods of economic decline, and during wartime in particular many patients starved to death. Asylums became notorious for poor living conditions, lack of hygiene, overcrowding, and ill-treatment and [[abuse of patients]].<ref name=Fakhourya07>{{cite journal |author=Fakhourya W, Priebea S |title=Deinstitutionalization and reinstitutionalization: major changes in the provision of mental healthcare |journal=Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue8= |pages=313–316 |month=August |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.mppsy.2007.05.008 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1476179307001085 |issue=8}}</ref> 

The first community-based alternatives were suggested and tentatively implemented in the 1920s and 1930s, although asylum numbers continued to increase up to the 1950s. The movement for deinstitutionalization came to the fore in various countries in the 1950s and 1960s. 

The prevailing public arguments, time of onset, and pace of reforms varied by country.<ref name=Fakhourya07/> [[Class action lawsuit]]s in the United States, and the scrutiny of institutions through [[disability activism]] and [[antipsychiatry]], helped expose the poor conditions and treatment. Sociologists and others argued that such institutions maintained or created dependency, passivity, exclusion and disability, causing people to be [[institutional syndrome|institutionalized]]. 

There was an argument that community services would be cheaper. It was suggested that new psychiatric medications made it more feasible to release people into the community.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rochefort DA |title=Origins of the "Third psychiatric revolution": the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 |journal=J Health Polit Policy Law |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–30 |date=Spring 1984 |pmid=6736594 |url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6736594 |doi=10.1215/03616878-9-1-1}}</ref>

There were differing views on deinstitutionalization, however, in groups such as mental health professionals, public officials, families, advocacy groups, public citizens, and unions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scherl DJ, Macht LB |title=Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=599–604 |year=1979 |month=September |pmid=223959 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=223959}}</ref>

==21st century==

===Asia===
In Japan, the number of hospital beds has risen steadily over the last few decades.<ref name=Fakhourya07/> 

In Hong Kong, a number of residential care services such as half-way houses, long-stay care homes, and supported hostels are provided for the discharged patients.  In addition, a number of community support services such as Community Rehabilitation Day Services, Community Mental Health Link, Community Mental Health Care, etc. have been launched to facilitate the re-integration of patients  into the community.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand established a [[Truth and reconciliation commission|reconciliation]] initiative in 2005 in the context of ongoing [[damages|compensation]] payouts to ex-patients of state-run mental institutions in the 1970s to 1990s. The forum heard of poor reasons for admissions; unsanitary and overcrowded conditions; lack of communication to patients and family members; physical violence and sexual misconduct and abuse; inadequate complaints mechanisms; pressures and difficulties for staff, within an [[authoritarian]] [[psychiatric]] hierarchy based on containment; fear and humiliation in the misuse of [[seclusion]]; over-use and abuse of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]], [[psychiatric medication]] and other treatments/punishments, including [[group therapy]], with continued [[adverse effects]]; lack of support on discharge; interrupted lives and lost potential; and continued stigma, prejudice and emotional distress and trauma. 

There were some references to instances of helpful aspects or kindnesses despite the system. Participants were offered counseling to help them deal with their experiences, and advice on their rights, including access to records and legal redress.<ref>Dept of Internal Affairs, New Zealand Government. [http://www.confidentialforum.govt.nz/ Te Āiotanga: Report of the Confidential Forum for Former In-Patients of Psychiatric Hospitals] June 2007</ref>

===Africa===
* Uganda has one psychiatric hospital.<ref name=Fakhourya07/>
* South Africa has several psychiatric hospitals. These hospitals are spread throughout the country.  Some of the most well-known institutions are: [[Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital]], colloquially known as Groendakkies ("Little Green Roofs") and [[Denmar Psychiatric Hospital]] in Pretoria, TARA [http://www.medpages.co.za/sf/index.php?page=organisation&orgcode=241845] in Johannesburg, and [[Valkenberg Hospital]] in Cape Town.

===Europe===

Countries where deinstitutionalization has happened may be experiencing a process of "re-institutionalization" or relocation to different institutions, as evidenced by increases in the number of [[supported housing]] facilities, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatric]] beds and rising numbers in the prison population.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Priebe S |title=Reinstitutionalisation in mental health care: comparison of data on service provision from six European countries |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7483 |pages=123–6 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15567803 |pmc=544427 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38296.611215.AE |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15567803 |author-separator=, |author2=Badesconyi A |author3=Fioritti A |display-authors=3 |last4=Hansson |first4=L |last5=Kilian |first5=R |last6=Torres-Gonzales |first6=F |last7=Turner |first7=T |last8=Wiersma |first8=D}}</ref>

Some developing European countries still rely on asylums.

===United States===

The United States has experienced two waves of [[deinstitutionalization]]. Wave one began in the 1950s and targeted people with mental illness.<ref name="Stroman">Stroman, Duane. 2003. “The Disability Rights Movement: From Deinstitutionalization to Self-determination.'' University Press of America.</ref>  The second wave began roughly fifteen years after and focused on individuals who had been diagnosed with a [[developmental disability]] (e.g. mentally impaired).<ref name="Stroman"/> Although these waves began over fifty years ago, deinstitutionalization continues today; however, these waves are growing smaller as fewer people are sent to institutions.

A process of indirect [[cost-shifting]] may have led to a form of "re-institutionalization" through the increased use of jail detention for those with mental disorders deemed unmanageable and noncompliant.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Domino ME, Norton EC, Morrissey JP, Thakur N |title=Cost shifting to jails after a change to managed mental health care |journal=Health Serv Res |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=1379–401 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15333114 |pmc=1361075 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2004.00295.x }}</ref> In Summer 2009, author and columnist [[Heather Mac Donald]] stated in ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'', "jails have become society’s primary mental institutions, though few have the funding or expertise to carry out that role properly... at [[Rikers]], 28 percent of the inmates require mental health services, a number that rises each year."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Jail Inferno|first=Heather|last=Mac Donald|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_jails.html|publisher=''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''|accessdate=27 July 2009|authorlink=Heather Mac Donald}}</ref>

===South America===
In several [[South American]] countries, the total number of beds in asylum-type institutions has decreased, replaced by psychiatric inpatient units in general hospitals and other local settings.<ref name=Fakhourya07/>
