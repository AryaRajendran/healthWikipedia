The '''knee''' [[joint]] joins the [[thigh]] with the lower leg and consists of two [[Articulations (anatomy)|articulations]]: one between the [[femur]] and [[tibia]], and one between the femur and [[patella]].<ref>{{EMedicineDictionary|knee+joint}}</ref>  It is the largest joint in the human body and is very complicated.<ref>Kulowski (1932), p 618</ref> The knee is a mobile trocho-ginglymus (a pivotal hinge joint),<ref>See [[trochoid]] and [[Hinge joint|ginglymus]].</ref> which permits [[flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation. Since in humans the knee supports nearly the whole weight of the body, it is vulnerable to both acute injury and the development of [[osteoarthritis]].

It is often grouped into '''tibiofemoral''' and patellofemoral components.<ref name="pmid19594940">{{cite journal |author=Rytter S, Egund N, Jensen LK, Bonde JP |title=Occupational kneeling and radiographic tibiofemoral and patellofemoral osteoarthritis |journal=J Occup Med Toxicol |volume=4 |issue= |pages=19 |year=2009 |pmid=19594940 |pmc=2726153 |doi=10.1186/1745-6673-4-19 |url=http://www.occup-med.com/content/4//19}}</ref><ref name="pmid19726621">{{cite journal |author=Gill TJ, Van de Velde SK, Wing DW, Oh LS, Hosseini A, Li G |title=Tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics after reconstruction of an isolated posterior cruciate ligament injury: in vivo analysis during lunge |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=37 |issue=12 |pages=2377–85 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19726621 |doi=10.1177/0363546509341829 |url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19726621}}</ref> (The [[fibular collateral ligament]] is often considered with tibiofemoral components.)<ref name="pmid17764523">{{cite journal |author=Scott J, Lee H, Barsoum W, van den Bogert AJ |title=The effect of tibiofemoral loading on proximal tibiofibular joint motion |journal=J.

== Human anatomy ==
[[Image:Gray246.png|thumb|Articular surfaces of femur.]]
[[Image:Gray257.png|thumb|Articular surfaces of tibia.]]
The knee is a [[hinge]] type [[synovial joint]], which is composed of three functional compartments: the femoropatellar articulation consists of the [[patella]], or "kneecap", and the [[patellar groove]] on the front of the [[femur]] through which it slides; and the medial and lateral femorotibial articulations linking the femur, or thigh bone, with the [[tibia]], the main bone of the lower leg.<ref name="Burgener-390">Burgener (2002), p 390</ref>  The joint is bathed in [[synovial fluid]] which is contained inside the [[synovial membrane]] called the [[Articular capsule of the knee joint|joint capsule]]. The [[posterolateral corner]] of the knee is an area that has recently been the subject of renewed scrutiny and research.

The knee is one of the most important joints of our body. It plays an essential role in movement related to carrying the body weight in horizontal (running and walking) and vertical (jumps) directions.

At birth, a [[baby]] will not have a conventional knee cap, but a growth formed of cartilage.  By the time that the child is 3-5 years of age, [[ossification]] will have replaced the cartilage with bone. Because it is the largest [[Sesamoid_bone|sesamoid bone]] in the human body, the [[ossification]] process takes significantly longer.<ref name=HowStufWorks.com "Do babies have kneecaps?">http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/babies-kneecaps1.htm</ref>

=== Articular bodies ===
The articular bodies of the femur are its [[lateral condyle of femur|lateral]] and [[Medial condyle of femur|medial]] [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]]s.  These diverge slightly distally and posteriorly, with the lateral condyle being wider in front than at the back while the medial condyle is of more constant width.<ref name="Platzer-206">Platzer (2004), p 206</ref>  The radius of the condyles' curvature in the [[sagittal plane]] becomes smaller toward the back.  This diminishing radius produces a series of [[involute]] midpoints (i.e. located on a spiral).  The resulting series of transverse axes permit the sliding and rolling motion in the flexing knee while ensuring the collateral ligaments are sufficiently lax to permit the rotation associated with the curvature of the medial condyle about a vertical axis.<ref name="Platzer-194">Platzer (2004), pp 194-195</ref>

The pair of tibial condyles are separated by the intercondylar eminence<ref name="Platzer-206" /> composed of a lateral and a medial tubercle.<ref name="Platzer-202">Platzer (2004), p 202</ref>

The [[patella]] is inserted into the thin anterior wall of the joint capsule.<ref name="Platzer-206" />  On its posterior surface is a lateral and a medial articular surface,<ref name="Platzer-194" /> both of which communicate with the [[Patellar surface of femur|patellar surface]] which unites the two femoral condyles on the anterior side of the bone's distal end.<ref name="Platzer-192">Platzer (2004), p 192</ref>

=== Articular capsule ===
{{double image|right|Gray351.png|100|Gray352.png|100|Lateral and posterior aspects of right knee}}
{{Main|Articular capsule of the knee joint}}
The articular capsule has a [[Synovial fluid|synovial]] and a [[fibrous]] membrane separated by fatty deposits.  Anteriorly, the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia, but on the femur, the suprapatellar [[bursae|bursa]] or recess extends the joint space proximally.<ref name="Platzer-210">Platzer (2004), p 210</ref>  The suprapatellar bursa is prevented from being pinched during extension by the [[articularis genu muscle]].<ref name="Reider-etal">{{cite web |title=The anterior aspect of the knee joint | author=B Reider, JL Marshall, B Koslin, B Ring and FG Girgis |publisher=J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1981;63:351-356. |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/63/3/351.pdf | year=1981 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>  Behind, the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions similar to the anterior recess.  Between these two extensions, the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint, thus forming a pocket direct inward.<ref name="Platzer-210" />

=== Bursae ===
{{Main|Bursae of the knee joint}}
Numerous [[bursa (anatomy)|bursae]] surround the knee joint.  The largest communicative bursa is the [[suprapatellar bursa]] described above.  Four considerably smaller bursae are located on the back of the knee.  Two non-communicative bursae are located in front of the patella and below the patellar [[tendon]], and others are sometimes present.
<ref name="Platzer-210" />

=== Cartilage ===
[[Cartilage]] is a thin, elastic [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that protects the [[bone]] and makes certain that the [[joint]] surfaces can slide easily over each other. Cartilage ensures supple knee movement. There are two types of joint cartilage in the knees: fibrous cartilage (the [[meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]]) and [[hyaline cartilage]]. Fibrous cartilage has tensile strength and can resist pressure. Hyaline cartilage covers the surface along which the joints move. Cartilage will wear over the years. Cartilage has a very limited capacity for self-restoration. The newly formed tissue will generally consist for a large part of fibrous cartilage of lesser quality than the original hyaline cartilage. As a result, new cracks and tears will form in the cartilage over time.

=== Menisci ===
The [[articular disk]]s of the knee-joint are called [[meniscus (anatomy)|menisci]] because they only partly divide the joint space.<ref name0"Platzer-26>Platzer (2004), p 26</ref>  These two disks, the [[medial meniscus]] and the [[lateral meniscus]], consist of connective tissue with extensive collagen fibers containing cartilage-like cells.  Strong fibers run along the menisci from one attachment to the other, while weaker radial fibers are interlaced with the former.  The menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint, fused with the synovial membrane laterally, and can move over the tibial surface.
<ref name="Platzer-208">Platzer (2004), p 208</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gibbon|first=Anthony|title=Knee Anatomy|url=http://tony-gibbon.co.uk/treatment/knee-treatment/anatomy/knee-anatomy|publisher=North Yorkshire Orthopaedic Specialists|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> 

The menisci serve to protect the ends of the bones from rubbing on each other and to effectively deepen the tibial sockets into which the femur attaches. They also play a role in shock absorption, and may be cracked, or torn, when the knee is forcefully rotated and/or bent.

=== Ligaments ===
[[Image:Knee diagram.svg|thumb|Anterolateral aspect of right knee.]]
[[Image:Knee medial view.gif|thumb|Anteromedial aspect of knee]]
The ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and, together with several menisci and bursae, protect the articular capsule.

==== Intracapsular ====
The knee is stabilized by a pair of [[cruciate ligament]]s. The [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) stretches from the [[lateral condyle of femur]] to the [[anterior intercondylar area]]. The ACL is critically important because it prevents the tibia from being pushed too far anterior relative to the femur. It is often torn during twisting or bending of the knee.  The [[posterior cruciate ligament]] (PCL) stretches from [[medial condyle of femur]] to the [[posterior intercondylar area]]. Injury to this ligament is uncommon but can occur as a direct result of forced trauma to the ligament. This ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur.

The [[Transverse ligament of knee|transverse ligament]] stretches from the [[lateral meniscus]] to the [[medial meniscus]]. It passes in front of the menisci.  It is divided into several strips in 10% of cases.<ref name="Platzer-208" /> The two menisci are attached to each other anteriorly by the ligament.<ref>Diab (1999), p 200</ref> The [[posterior meniscofemoral ligament|posterior]] and [[anterior meniscofemoral ligament]]s stretch from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the medial femoral condyle. They pass posteriorly behind the posterior cruciate ligament. The posterior meniscofemoral ligament is more commonly present (30%); both ligaments are present less often.<ref name="Platzer-208" /> The [[Coronary ligament of the knee|meniscotibial ligaments]] (or "coronary") stretches from inferior edges of the mensici to the periphery of the tibial plateaus.

==== Extracapsular ====
The [[patellar ligament]] connects the [[patella]] to the [[tuberosity of the tibia]]. It is also occasionally called the patellar tendon because there is no definite separation between the [[quadriceps tendon]] (which surrounds the patella) and the area connecting the patella to the tibia.<ref>MedicineNet.com, ''Definition of Patellar tendon''</ref> This very strong ligament helps give the patella its mechanical leverage<ref name="Moore-954">Moore (2006), p 194</ref> and also functions as a cap for the condyles of the femur. Laterally and medially to the patellar ligament the [[lateral patellar retinaculum|lateral]] and [[medial patellar retinaculum|medial patellar retinacula]] connect fibers from the [[Vastus lateralis muscle|vasti lateralis]] and [[Vastus medialis muscle|medialis muscles]] to the tibia. Some fibers from the [[iliotibial tract]] radiate into the lateral retinaculum and the medial retinaculum receives some transverse fibers arising on the medial femoral epicondyle.
<ref name="Platzer-206" />

The [[medial collateral ligament]] (MCL a.k.a. "tibial") stretches from the [[medial epicondyle of the femur]] to the [[medial tibial condyle]]. It is composed of three groups of fibers, one stretching between the two bones, and two fused with the medial meniscus. The MCL is partly covered by the [[Pes anserinus (leg)|pes anserinus]] and the tendon of the [[semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]] passes under it.<ref name="Platzer-206" /> It protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee (a [[valgus deformity|valgus]] force). The [[fibular collateral ligament|lateral collateral ligament]] (LCL a.k.a. "fibular") stretches from the [[lateral epicondyle of the femur]] to the [[head of fibula]]. It is separate from both the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus.<ref name="Platzer-206" /> It protects the lateral side from an inside bending force (a [[varus deformity|varus]] force).

Lastly, there are two ligaments on the dorsal side of the knee.  The [[oblique popliteal ligament]] is a radiation of the tendon of the [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]] on the medial side, from where it is direct laterally and proximally. The [[arcuate popliteal ligament]] originates on the apex of the head of the fibula to stretch proximally, crosses the tendon of the [[popliteus muscle]], and passes into the capsule.<ref name="Platzer-206" />

The knee permits [[flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] about a virtual transverse axis, as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position.  The knee joint is called "mobile" because the femur and [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] [[meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] move<ref>''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 399</ref> over the tibia during rotation, while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion.<ref name="Platzer-212">Platzer (2004), pp 212-213</ref>

The center of the transverse axis of the extension/flexion movements is located where both collateral ligaments and both cruciate ligaments intersect.  This center moves upward and backward during flexion, while the distance between the center and the articular surfaces of the femur changes dynamically with the decreasing curvature of the femoral condyles.  The total range of motion is dependent on several parameters such as soft-tissue restraints, active insufficiency, and hamstring tightness.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-398" />

==== Extended position ====
With the knee extended both the [[lateral collateral ligament|lateral]] and [[medial collateral ligament]]s, as well as the anterior part of the [[anterior cruciate ligament]], are taut.  During extension, the femoral condyles glide into a position which causes the complete unfolding of the [[tibial collateral ligament]].  During the last 10° of extension, an '''obligatory terminal rotation''' is triggered in which the knee is rotated medially 5°.  The final rotation is produced by a lateral rotation of the tibia in the non-weight-bearing leg, and by a medial rotation of the femur in the weight-bearing leg.  This terminal rotation is made possible by the shape of the medial femoral condyle, assisted by contraction of the popliteus muscle and the [[iliotibial tract]] and is caused by the stretching of the anterior cruciate ligament.  Both cruciate ligaments are slightly unwinded and both lateral ligaments become taut.<ref name="Platzer-212" />

==== Flexed position ====
In the flexed position, the collateral ligaments are relaxed while the cruciate ligaments are taut.  Rotation is controlled by the twisted cruciate ligaments; the two ligaments get twisted around each other during medial rotation of the tibia — which reduces the amount of rotation possible — while they become unwound during lateral rotation of the tibia.  Because of the oblique position of the cruciate ligaments at least a part of one of them is always tense and these ligaments control the joint as the collateral ligaments are relaxed.  Furthermore, the dorsal fibers of the tibial collateral ligament become tensed during extreme medial rotation and the ligament also reduces the lateral rotation to 45-60°.<ref name="Platzer-212" />

===Blood supply===
[[Image:Gray552.png|thumb|Arteries of the knee]]
The [[femoral artery]] and the [[popliteal artery]] help form the arterial network surrounding the knee joint (articular [[rete]]). There are 6 main branches:

* 1. [[Superior medial genicular artery]]
* 2. [[Superior lateral genicular artery]]
* 3. [[Inferior medial genicular artery]]
* 4. [[Inferior lateral genicular artery]]
* 5. [[Descending genicular artery]]
* 6. [[Anterior tibial recurrent artery|Recurrent branch of anterior tibial artery]]

The medial genicular arteries penetrate the knee joint.

==Disorders and injury==
Knee pain is caused by trauma, misalignment, and degeneration as well as by conditions like [[arthritis]].<ref>"[http://healthlifeandstuff.com/2009/07/back-of-knee-pain-causes/ Back of Knee Pain Causes]</ref> The most common knee disorder is generally known as [[patellofemoral syndrome]].The majority of minor cases of knee pain can be treated at home with rest and ice but more serious injuries do require [[surgery|surgical]] care.

One form of patellofemoral syndrome involves a tissue-related problem that creates pressure and irritation in the knee between the patella and the trochlea ([[patellar compression syndrome]]), which causes pain.  The second major class of knee disorder involves a tear, slippage, or dislocation that impairs the structural ability of the knee to balance the leg ([[patellofemoral instability syndrome]]). Patellofemoral instability syndrome may cause either pain, a sense of poor balance, or both.<ref name=Afra>{{cite journal |author=Afra R and Schepsis A |title=Addressing patellofemoral pathology: Biomechanics and classification |journal=The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |date=May 28, 2008|url=http://jmm.consultantlive.com/article/1145622/1403741}}</ref>

Age also contributes to disorders of the knee. Particularly in older people, knee pain frequently arises due to osteoarthritis. In addition, weakening of tissues around the knee may contribute to the problem.<ref name=Pill>{{cite journal |author=Pill SG, Khoury LD, Chin GC ''et al.'' |title=MRI for evaluating knee pain in older patients: How useful is it? |journal=The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |date=October 29, 2008 |url=http://jmm.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145622/1404837}}</ref> Patellofemoral instability may relate to hip abnormalities or to tightness of surrounding ligaments.<ref name=Afra/>

[[Cartilage]] lesions can be caused by:
* Accidents (fractures)
* Injuries
* The removal of a [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]]
* [[Anterior cruciate ligament]] injury
* [[Posterior cruciate ligament]] injury
* [[Posterolateral corner]] injury
* [[Medial knee injuries]]
* Considerable strain on the knee.

Any kind of work during which the knees undergo heavy stress may also be detrimental to cartilage. This is especially the case in professions in which people frequently have to walk, lift, or squat. Other causes of pain may be excessive on, and wear of, the knees, in combination with such things as [[muscle weakness]] and [[overweight]].

Common complaints:
* A painful, blocked, locked or swollen knee.
* Sufferers sometimes feel as if their knees are about to give way, or may feel uncertain about their movement.

                
=== Overall fitness and knee injury ===
Physical fitness is related integrally to the development of knee problems. The same activity such as climbing stairs may cause pain from patellofemoral compression for someone who is physically unfit, but not for someone else (or even for that person at a different time). Obesity is another major contributor to knee pain. For instance, a 30-year-old woman who weighed 120&nbsp;lb at age 18 years, before her three pregnancies, and now weighs 285&nbsp;lb, had added 660&nbsp;lb of force across her patellofemoral joint with each step.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Andrish JT |title= Sports injuries in weekend warriors: 20 Clinical pearls
 |journal=The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |volume=26|issue=5 |date=May 8, 2009 |url=http://jmm.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145622/1412245}}</ref>

=== Common injuries due to physical activity ===
[[Image:Prothese-genou-IMG 0033.jpg|thumb|Model demonstrating parts of an artificial knee]]
In sports that place great pressure on the knees, especially with twisting forces, it is common to tear one or more ligaments or cartilages. Some of the most common knee injuries are those to the medial side: [[medial knee injuries]].

===Anterior cruciate ligament injury===
{{Main|Anterior cruciate ligament injury}}
ACL is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee. The injury is common during sports. Twisting of the knee is a common cause of over-stretching or tearing the ACL. When the ACL is injured one may hear a popping sound and the leg may suddenly give out. Besides [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] and pain, walking may be painful and the knee will feel unstable. Minor tears of the anterior cruciate ligament may heal over time, but a torn ACL requires surgery. After surgery, recovery is prolonged and low impact exercises are recommended to strengthen the joint.<ref>[http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/kneepainandinjuries/Knee_Pain_and_Injuries.htm Knee pain and injuries] About sports online portal. 2010-01-26</ref>

===Torn meniscus injury===
The menisci act as shock absorbers and separate the two ends of bone in the knee [[joint]]. There are two menisci in the knee, the medial (inner) and the lateral (outer). When there is torn cartilage, it means that the meniscus has been injured. Meniscus tears occur during sports often when the knee is twisted. Menisci injury may be innocuous and one may be able to walk after a tear, but soon swelling and pain set in. Sometimes the knee will lock while bending. Pain often occurs when one squats. Small [[Tear of meniscus|meniscus]] tears are treated conservatively but most large tears require surgery.<ref>Tandeter, Howard B. [http://www.aafp.org/afp/991201ap/2599.html "Acute Knee Injuries: Use of Decision Rules for Selective Radiograph Ordering"] 2010-01-26.</ref>

===Fractures===
[[File:Xraymachine.JPG|thumb|[[Radiography]] to examine eventual fractures after a knee injury.]]
Knee fractures are rare but do occur, especially as a result of motor vehicle accidents. There is usually immediate pain; swelling and one may not be able to stand on the leg. The muscles go into [[spasm]] and even the slightest movements are painful. [[X-ray]]s can easily confirm the injury and surgery depends on the degree of displacement and type of fracture.

===Ruptured tendon===
Tendons usually attach muscle to bone. In the knee the quadriceps and patellar tendon can sometimes tear. The injuries to these tendons occur when there is forceful [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of the knee. If the tendon is completely torn, bending or extending the leg is impossible. A completely torn tendon requires surgery but a partially torn tendon can be treated with leg immobilization followed by [[physical therapy]].

===Overuse===
Overuse injuries of the knee include [[tendonitis]], [[bursitis]], muscle strains and [[iliotibial band syndrome]]. These injuries often develop slowly over weeks or months. Activities that induce pain usually delay healing. Rest, ice and compression do help in most cases. Once the swelling has diminished, [[heating pad|heat packs]] can increase blood supply and promote healing. Most overuse injuries subside with time but can flare up if the activities are quickly resumed.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/kneeinjuriesanddisorders.html Knee injuries and disorders] MedLine Plus. 2010-01-26</ref>
To prevent overuse injuries, warm up prior to exercise, limit high impact activities and keep your weight under control.

=== Surgical interventions ===
Before the advent of [[arthroscopy]] and [[arthroscopic surgery]], patients having surgery for a torn ACL required at least nine months of rehabilitation, having initially spent several weeks in a full-length plaster cast.  With [[Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction|current techniques]], such patients may be walking without crutches in two weeks, and playing some sports in a few months.

In addition to developing new surgical procedures, ongoing research is looking into underlying problems which may increase the likelihood of an athlete suffering a severe knee injury.  These findings may lead to effective preventive measures, especially in female athletes, who have been shown to be especially vulnerable to ACL tears from relatively minor trauma.

'''[[Articular cartilage repair]] treatment''' :
* [[Arthroscopic]] debriment of the knee ([[arthroscopic lavage]]).
* Mosaïc-plasty.
* Microfracture (Ice-picking).
* [[Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation]].
* Osteochondral [[Autograft]] and [[Allografts]].
* [[PLC Reconstruction]]

== Animal anatomy ==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2009}}
In humans the knee refers to the joints between the femur, tibia and patella. In quadrupeds, particularly horses and [[ungulates]] the laymans term "knee" is commonly used to refer to the [[carpus]]. The joints between the femur, tibia and patella are known as the [[Stifle joint|stifle]] in quadrupeds. In insects and other animals the term knee is used widely to refer to any ginglymus joint.
