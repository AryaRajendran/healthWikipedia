'''Aphthous stomatitis''' (also termed '''canker sores''', '''recurrent aphthous stomatitis''', '''RAS''', '''recurring oral aphthae''' and '''recurrent aphthous ulceration''') is a common cause of benign and non-contagious [[mouth ulcers]] (canker sores). This condition is characterized by the repeated formation of [[ulcer]]s on the [[mucous membrane]] of the [[oral cavity]] (the lining of the mouth), in otherwise healthy individuals.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012">{{cite journal|last=Brocklehurst|first=P|coauthors=Tickle, M; Glenny, AM; Lewis, MA; Pemberton, MN; Taylor, J; Walsh, T; Riley, P; Yates, JM|title=Systemic interventions for recurrent aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers).|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Sep 12|volume=9|pages=CD005411|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005411.pub2|pmid=22972085|url=}}</ref> These ulcers occur periodically and heal completely between attacks. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The cause is not completely understood, but may involve a [[T cell]] mediated [[immune response]] which is triggered by a variety of factors. Different people may have different triggers, including [[nutritional deficiency|nutritional deficiencies]], local trauma, stress, hormonal influences, allergies, and a genetic predisposition. The condition is very common, affecting about 20% of the general population. There is no cure, and treatments are aimed at reducing pain and speeding the healing process. Often, the onset of the condition is during childhood or adolescence and usually lasts for several years before gradually disappearing, with or without any form of treatment.

==Classification==
[[File:Aphthous ulcer.jpg|thumb| Aphthous ulcers on the labial mucosa (lower lip is retracted). Note erythematous "halo" surrounding ulcer.]]
Three variants of aphthous stomatitis exist, distinguished by the size, number and location of the lesions, the healing time of individual ulcers and whether a scar is left after healing.

===Minor aphthous ulceration===
This is the most common type of aphthous stomatitis, accounting for about 80% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU),<ref name="Scully 2008" /> or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10&nbsp;mm in diameter and affect non-[[keratinization|keratinized]] mucosal surfaces (i.e. the [[oral mucosa|labial]] and [[buccal mucosa]], [[Human anatomical terms#Near or away from the vertical longitudinal center of the body|lateral]] borders of the tongue and the [[floor of mouth|floor of the mouth]]). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration, there is usually an ulcer-free period of variable length before the next episode occurs.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />

===Major aphthous ulceration===
This subtype makes up about 10% of all cases of aphthous stomatitis.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> It is termed major aphthous ulceration (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthae (major aphthous ulcers) are similar to minor aphthae, but are more than 10&nbsp;mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /><ref name="OMF path textbook" /> Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces a greater number of ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved.

===Herpetiform ulceration===
Also termed stomatitis herpetiformis,<ref name=ICD-10>{{cite web|title=International Classification of Diseases-10|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/K12.0|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> herpetiform ulcers,<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> or herpes-like ulcerations, this type of aphthous stomatitis is so named because the lesions resemble a primary infection with [[herpes simplex]] ([[primary herpetic gingivostomatitis]]).<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by [[Herpesviridae|herpes viruses]]. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. These ulcers are less than 1&nbsp;mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized.<!-- <ref name="Scully 2008" /> --> Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers.<!-- <ref name="Scully 2008" /> --> Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous.<!-- <ref name="Scully 2008" /> --> It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes. Females are affected slightly more frequently than males.<ref name="Scully 2008" />

===RAS type ulceration===
Aphthous stomatitis occurs in individuals with no associated systemic disease.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> Persons with certain [[systemic disease]]s may be prone to oral ulceration, but this is secondary to the underlying medical condition.<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> Examples include [[Behçet's disease]],<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> [[Reiter's syndrome]],<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> recurrent [[erythema multiforme]],<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> [[celiac disease]],<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> [[Crohn's disease]],<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> [[ulcerative colitis]],<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> [[anemia]]<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> and [[hematinic]] deficiency ([[vitamin B12]], [[folic acid]] and [[iron]]).<!-- <ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />  --> Recurrent oral ulceration associated with systemic conditions is termed "RAS type ulceration", "RAS like ulceration" or "aphthous-like ulcers".<ref name="Scully 2008">{{cite book|last=Scully C|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068188|pages=151–157|edition=2nd ed.|chapter=14: Aphthae (recurrent aphthous stomatitis)|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n0NUhLkI_TEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> This kind of ulceration is considered to be separate from true aphthous stomatitis.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />

==Signs and symptoms==
Persons with aphthous stomatitis have no clinically detectable systemic symptoms or signs (i.e. outside the mouth).<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Generally, symptoms may include [[prodromal]] sensations such as burning, itching or stinging, which may precede the appearance of any lesion by some hours, and pain,<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" />  --> which is often out of proportion to the extent of the ulceration<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" />  --> and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g. acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses.<ref name="Treister 2010" /> If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, [[oropharynx]] or [[esophagus]] can cause [[odynophagia]] (painful swallowing).<ref name="Treister 2010" /> Severe disease, characterized by virtual constant ulceration (new lesions developing before old ones have healed), may cause debilitating chronic pain, weight loss and [[malnutrition]].<ref name="Treister 2010" /> Signs are limited to the lesions themselves. Aphthous ulcers typically begin as [[erythema]]tous [[macule]]s (reddened, flat area of mucosa) which develops into ulcers that are covered with a yellow-grey [[fibrin]]ous membrane which can be scraped away.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" />  --> An erythematous "halo" surrounds the ulcer.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> The size, number, location, healing time and periodicity between episodes of ulcer formation are all dependent upon the subtype of aphthous stomatitis (see [[Aphthous stomatitis#classification|classification]]).

==Causes==
The cause is not entirely clear,<ref name="Scully 2008" /> but is thought to be multifactorial.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> It has even been suggested that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and non-sexually transmissible.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> The mucosal destruction is thought to be the result of a [[T cell]] mediated immune response which involves the generation of T cells, [[interleukin]]s and [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]].<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> When early aphthous ulcers are [[biopsy|biopsied]], the [[histology|histologic]] appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of [[T lymphocytes]].<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> Persons with aphthous stomatitis have circulating lymphocytes which react with [[peptide]]s 91-105 of [[heat shock protein]] 65-60.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Despite this preferred theory of immuno-dysregulation held by most researchers,<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> there is no association between aphthous stomatitis and other [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] diseases, and the common [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] are not found, meaning that aphthous stomatitis is not a classical autoimmune disease.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Aphthous stomatitis also tends to resolve spontaneously with advancing age rather than worsen.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Usually, [[serum (blood)|serum]] [[immunoglobulin]] is at normal levels.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> The triggers for the process of mucosal destruction are multiple. Different subgroups of individuals with aphthous stomatitis appear to have different causes for the condition.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> This suggests that there are a number of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> These sub-groups have been considered to be in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and increase in antigenic exposure.

===Primary immuno-dysregulation===
At least 40% of people with aphthous stomaitits have a positive family history, suggesting that some people are genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> [[HLA-B12]], [[HLA-B51]], [[HLA-Cw7]], [[HLA-A2]], [[HLA-A11]], and [[HLA-DR2]] are examples of [[human leukocyte antigen]] types associated (although inconsistently) with aphthous stomatitis.<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="OMF path textbook" /> Stress has effects on the immune system, (see [[Stress (biology)#Effect of stress on the immune system|Effect of stress on the immune system]]), which may explain why some cases directly correlate with stress. E.g., ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation.<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="OMF path textbook" /> Aphthous-like ulceration also occurs in conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. [[cyclic neutropenia]] and [[human immunodeficiency virus]] infection.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> The relative increase in percentage of [[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T lymphocytes]], caused by a reduction in numbers of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T lymphocytes]] may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.<ref name="OMF path textbook" />

===Decrease of the mucosal barrier===
The thickness of the mucosa may be an important factor in aphthous stomatitis. Usually, ulcers form on non keratinizing mucosal surfaces in the mouth.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> Factors which decrease the thickness of mucosa increase the frequency of occurrence, and factors which increase the thickness of the mucosa correlate with decreased ulceration.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> The nutritional deficiencies associated with aphthous stomatitis (B12, folate, and iron) all can cause a decrease in the thickness of the oral mucosa ([[atrophy]]).<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> Local trauma is also associated with aphthous stomatitis, and it is known that trauma can decrease the mucosal barrier.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> Hormonal factors are capable of altering the mucosal barrier. In a small subgroup of females with aphthous stomatits, there are fewer occurrences of aphthae during the [[luteal phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]] or with use of the [[contraceptive pill]].<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="OMF path textbook" /> This phase is associated with a fall in [[progestogen]] levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> This subgroup often experience remission during pregnancy.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> Aphthous stomatitis is uncommon in people who smoke.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> In extreme forms, this may be diagnosed as [[stomatitis nicotina]] (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to antigens, but this is unclear. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.<ref name="Odell 2010" />

===Increase in antigenic exposure===
[[Antigen|Antigenic stimuli]] have been implicated as a trigger, e.g. [[Streptococcus|L forms of streptococci]], [[herpes simplex virus]], [[varicella-zoster virus]], [[adenovirus]], and [[cytomegalovirus]].<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur at the same time as asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titers.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> In some subgroups, [[food allergy]] may be involved, and some may respond to strict elimination diets based on the results of [[patch test (medicine)|patch testing]].<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="OMF path textbook" /> [[Sodium lauryl sulphate]], a [[detergent]] present in some brands of toothpaste and oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration.<ref name="Scully 2008" />

{{main|Oral ulceration}}
Aphthous-like ulceration may occur in association with several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis,<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> but this type of oral ulceration may be not considered to be aphthous stomatitis.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces ([[conjunctiva]], genitals). Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to a decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> The main feature of Behçet disease is aphthous-like ulceration, but is usually more severe than seen in RAS, and typically resembles major or herpetiforme ulceration or both.<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" /> MAGIC syndrome is a possible variant of Behçet disease. PFAPA (periodic aphthae, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis) is a rare condition that tends to occur in children. The condition appears to improve after [[tonsillectomy]] or immunosuppression, suggesting a immunologic cause.<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" /> In cyclic neutropenia, there is a reduction in the level of circulating neutrophils in the blood that occurs about every 21 days. Opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous-like ulceration is worst during this time.<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" />

Nutritional deficiencies may occur without any underlying gastrointestinal disease. Iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies may be twice as common in people with RAS, but iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration.<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" /> The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency has been the subject of many studies. Although these studies found that 0-42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms.<ref name=Baccaglinietal_2011>{{cite journal| author=Baccaglini L, Lalla RV, Bruce AJ, Sartori-Valinotti JC, Latortue MC, Carrozzo M et al.| title=Urban legends: recurrent aphthous stomatitis. | journal=Oral Dis | year= 2011 | volume= 17 | issue= 8 | pages= 755-70 | pmid=21812866 | doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2011.01840.x | pmc=PMC3192917 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=21812866  }} </ref> 

Gastrointestinal disorders are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. Chron's disease, ulcerative colitis, Celiac disease, but the link is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by [[malabsorption]].<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" /> Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease. Again, removal of gluten from the diet does not usually improve the ulceration.<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" />

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is mostly based on the clinical appearance and the medical history.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> The most important diagnostic feature is a history of recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /> Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme and ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /><ref name="Odell 2010">{{cite book|last=Odell W|title=Clinical problem solving in dentistry|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443067846|edition=3rd ed.|pages=87-90}}</ref> A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" /> Tissue [[biopsy]] is not usually required, unless to rule out other suspected conditions such as oral [[squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name="Cawson 2002" /> The [[histopathology|histopathologic]] appearance is not [[pathognomonic]] (the appearance is non specific).<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> Early lesions have a central zone of ulceration covered by a fibrinous membrane.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> In the conenctive tissue deep to the ulcer there is increased [[vascularity]] and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, [[histiocyte]]s and [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> The [[epithelium]] on the margins of the ulcer shows [[spongiosis]] and there are many mononuclear cells in the basal third.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> There are also lymphocytes and histiocytes in the [[connective tissue]] surrounding deeper blood vessels near to the ulcer ("perivascular cuffing").<ref name="OMF path textbook" /><ref name="Cawson 2002" /> Special investigations may be indicated to rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include [[blood test]]s (e.g. to exclude anemia / deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease). Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, e.g. genital ulceration in Behçet's syndrome, which is in contrast to aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. [[nicorandil]]), and substitution to another drug may highlight a causal relationship.<ref name="Scully 2008" />

==Treatment==
<!-- ONLY RELIABLE SECONDARY SOURCES TO BE INCLUDED AS PER WP:MEDRS PRIMARY SOURCES WILL BE REMOVED -->
The vast majority of people with aphthous stomatitis have minor symptoms and do not require any specific therapy (the pain is tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of ulceration).<ref name="Treister 2010" />  Many different [[Route of administration#Topical|topical]] and [[Route of administration#Parenteral|systemic]] treatments have been proposed (see table),<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /><ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="McBride 2000">{{cite journal|last=McBride|first=DR|title=Management of aphthous ulcers.|journal=American family physician|date=2000 Jul 1|volume=62|issue=1|pages=149–54, 160|pmid=10905785|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0701/p149.html}}</ref><ref name="Scully Porter 2008" /> sometimes showing little or no evidence of efficacy when formally investigated.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> Some of the results of interventions for RAS may in truth represent a [[placebo effect]].<ref name="Scully Porter 2008" /> No therapy is curative,<!--<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />--> with treatment aiming to relieve pain, promote healing and reduce the frequency of episodes of ulceration.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />

Amlexanox applied topically is highly-studied and effective in healing; less conclusive research suggests that vitamin B12 supplementation and the avoidance of sodium lauryl sulfate in toothpaste prevent recurrence.<ref name=Baileyetal_2011>{{cite journal| author=Bailey J, McCarthy C, Smith RF| title=Clinical inquiry.

Occasionally, in females where ulceration is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to an oral contraceptive, progestogen or a change in oral contraceptive may be beneficial.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Systemic treatment is usually reserved for severe disease due to the risk of adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A [[systematic review]] found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" />

==Prognosis==
By definition, there is no serious underlying medical condition, and importantly the ulcers do not represent [[oral cancer]] and they are not infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling.<ref name="Treister 2010" /> Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop as a result of severe aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.<ref name="Scully 2008" />

==Epidemiology==
Reported prevalence ranges from 5 to 66%, but is probably about 20% for most populations,<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> making it the most common disease of the oral mucosa.<ref name="Cawson 2002">{{cite book|last=Cawson RA, Odell EW, Porter S|title=Cawson's essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine.|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0443071063|pages=192–195|edition=7. ed.}}</ref> Aphthous stomatitis occurs worldwide, but is more common in developed countries.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> There is a slightly higher prevalence in higher socioeconomic groups.<!-- <ref name="Scully 2008" />  --> There is no gender predilection, and the peak age of onset between ten and nineteen years.<ref name="Brocklehurst 2012" /> There have been reports of racial epidemiologic variation, e.g. in the United States of America, aphthous stomatitis may be three times more common in white skinned people than black skinned people.<ref name="Scully Porter 2008">{{cite journal|last=Scully|first=Crispian|coauthors=Porter, Stephen|title=Oral mucosal disease: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis|journal=British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|date=31 March 2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=198–206|doi=10.1016/j.bjoms.2007.07.201}}</ref>

The word is derived from the Greek word ''aphtha'' meaning "eruption" or "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae, including [[Bednar's aphthae]] (infected, traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants),<ref name="Tricarico 2012">{{cite journal|last=Tricarico|first=A|coauthors=Molteni, G; Mattioli, F; Guerra, A; Mordini, B; Presutti, L; Iughetti, L|title=Nipple trauma in infants?
