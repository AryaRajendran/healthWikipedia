'''Pro-ana''' refers to the promotion of the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]].  It is often referred to simply as "ana" and is sometimes personified by anorexics as a girl named 'Ana'.<ref name="nyt-udovitch">{{citation|title = A Secret Society of the Starving|date = 2002-09-08|accessdate = 2007-11-04|first = Mim|last = Udovitch|newspaper = [[New York Times]]|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3DF173EF93BA3575AC0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all}}</ref>  The lesser-used term '''pro-mia''' refers likewise to [[bulimia nervosa]]<ref name="elmundo-serna">{{citation|title = Ana y Mia, contra la anorexia|first = Carmen|last = Serna|url = http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2004/06/09/madrid/1648484.html|language = Spanish|newspaper = [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|accessdate = 2008-02-05|date = 2004-06-09}}</ref> and is sometimes used interchangeably with pro-ana.

Pro-ana organizations differ widely in their stances.  Most claim that they exist mainly as a non-judgmental environment for anorexics; a place to turn to, to discuss their illness, and to support those who choose to enter recovery.  Others deny anorexia nervosa is a mental illness and claim instead that it is a "lifestyle choice" that should be respected by doctors and family.<ref name="nyt-udovitch" />

== Culture ==
Medical professionals treating eating disorders have long noted that patients in recovery programs often "symptom pool", banding closely together for emotional support and validation.<ref name="brown">{{citation|title = The winner dies|publisher = [[Salon.com]]|first = Janelle|last = Brown|date = 2001-07-23|accessdate = 2009-04-25|url = http://dir.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/07/23/pro_ana}}</ref>  Anorexics may collectively normalize their condition, defending it not as an illness but as an accomplishment of self-control and an essential part of their identity.<ref>{{citation|title = Anatomy of Anorexia|author= Levenkron, Steven|isbn = 0-393-32101-0|year = 2001|publisher = [[W.

=== Online presence ===
Such advocacy has flourished on the Internet, mainly through tight-knit support groups centred around web forums and, more recently, social network services such as [[Tumblr]], [[Xanga]],<ref>{{citation|url = http://www.kitschmag.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=154&Itemid=27|title = I reside in skinny|last = Ensign|first = Rachel|issue = Fall 2006|magazine  =[[Kitsch (magazine)|Kitsch Magazine]]}}</ref> [[LiveJournal]], [[Facebook]] and [[Myspace]].<ref>{{citation|title = Before Spring Break, the Anorexic Challenge|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/fashion/sundaystyles/02BREAK.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all|first = Alex|last = Williams|date = 2006-04-02|accessdate = 2007-11-11|newspaper = [[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name="bbc"/>  These groups are typically small, vulnerable, partly hidden and characterized by frequent migrations.<ref name="casilli">{{citation|title = Studying Eating Disorders in the Social Web.

* The non-eating disordered who express disapproval, including the spouses, relatives and friends of members who appear on-site to post threats and warnings.<ref name="giles" />
* Casual dieters who join, believing that inducing eating disorders will cause them to lose weight more effectively.

==== Thinspiration ====
[[File:Thin Girl in black panties, one hand over her breasts, the other arm raised behind her head.jpg|thumb|A digitally altered example of thinspiration.]]

Pro-ana sites often (84%, in a 2010 survey<ref name="borzekowski" />) feature ''thinspiration'' (or ''thinspo''): images or video montages of slim women, often celebrities, who may be anything from naturally slim to [[emaciation|emaciated]] with visibly protruding bones.<ref>{{citation|title = Narrow Minded|first = Virginia|last = Heffernan|date = 2008-05-23|magazine = [[New York Times Magazine]]|accessdate = 2008-12-30|url = http://nytimes.com/2008/05/25/magazine/25wwln-medium-t.html | work=The New York Times}}</ref>  Pro-ana bloggers, forum members and social networking groups likewise post thinspiration to motivate one another toward further weight loss.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|title = Seeking "thinspiration"|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6935768.stm|first = Jacqueline|last = Head|publisher = BBC News|date = 2007-09-08|accessdate = 2007-11-06}}</ref>  Conversely, ''reverse thinspiration'' features images of fatty food or overweight people intended to induce disgust.  There exists significant controversy between supporters and opponents of thinspiration; some assert that thinspiration only "glorifies" eating disorders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/mobile/health/women/Dangerous+online+culture+glorifies+eating+disorders/6379943/story.html|title=Dangerous online culture glorifies eating disorders|last=Auxier|first=Brooke|date=29 March 2012|publisher=The Vancouver Sun|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref> while some thinspiration bloggers argue that the purpose of thinspiration is to raise awareness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proana.info/pro-ana-and-thinspiration-under-attack/|title=Pro Ana and Thinspiration Under Attack|date=10 April 2012|publisher=ProAna.info|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>

Thinspirational clips circulate widely on video sharing sites,<ref>{{citation|url = http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=8e8d21e0-c8da-4af1-b05c-01422ab6136d|title = Online anorexia videos prompt call for website restrictions|date = 2007-09-15|accessdate = 2009-04-21|first = Misty|last = Harris|newspaper = [[Edmonton Journal]]}}</ref> pro-ana blogs often post thinspirational entries, and many pro-ana forums have [[threaded discussion|threads]] dedicated to sharing thinspiration.  Thinspiration can also take the form of inspirational mantras, quotes or selections of lyrics from poetry or popular music<ref>{{citation|title = Learning to Love Anorexia? Pro-Ana Web Sites Flourish|url = http://www.observer.com/node/47063|first = Diedre|last = Dolan|date = 2003-02-02|newspaper = [[New York Observer]]|accessdate = 2007-11-06}}</ref> (94% of sites in a 2003 survey<ref>{{citation|title = Pro or con?

Thinspiration often has a spiritual-[[ascetic]] flavour, referring to  fasting through metaphors of bodily purity, food through allusions to sin and corruption, and thinness through imagery of angels and angelic flight. Exhortations like "Ana's Creed" and "The Thin Commandments" are also common.<ref name="norris" /><ref>{{citation|last = Maloney|first = Patricia|date = 2008-07-31|title = Quod Me Nutrit, Me Destruit: The Pro-Anorexia Movement and Religion|journal = American Sociological Association Annual Meeting 2008|url = http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/2/4/0/pages242403/p242403-1.php}}</ref>

=== Appeal ===
Social researchers studying pro-ana have varied explanations for its popularity, with some characterizing it as a rejection of modern consumerism<ref>{{citation|title = The dangers and draw of online communication: Pro-anorexia websites and their implications for users, practitioners, and researchers|last = Tierney|first = Stephanie|journal = Eating Disorders|volume = 14|pages = 181–190|year = 2006|publisher = Routledge|doi = 10.1080/10640260600638865|issue = 3|pmid = 16807213}}</ref> and others suggesting that pro-ana functions as a [[coping mechanism]] for those already emotionally stressed by eating disorders.<ref>{{citation|title = An interpretative phenomenological analysis of participation in a pro-anorexia internet site and its relationship with disordered eating|last1 = Mulveen|first1 = Ruaidhri|first2 = Julie|last2 = Hepworth|journal = Journal of health psychology|volume = 11|year = 2006|doi =  10.1177/1359105306061187|issue = 2|pmid = 16464925|pages = 283–96}}</ref>  Most, however, agree that pro-ana sites:
* Initially attract both the non-eating disordered (who first visit seeking tips and techniques for losing weight) and the eating-disordered (who seek advice on hiding their disordered behaviors, or minimizing the physical damage caused by over-exercising and severe calorie restriction).
* Give their members a strong sense of community and common identity.<ref>{{citation|url = http://www.wesleyan.edu/psyc/mindmatters/volume03/article05.pdf|title = Pro-Anorexia Websites: Content, Impact, and Explanations of Popularity|first = Grace|last = Overbeke|year = 2008|journal = The Wesleyan Journal of Psychology|volume = 3|pages = 49–62}}</ref>

=== Fashion ===
Red bracelets are popularly worn in pro-ana, both as a discreet way for anorexics to socially identify and as a tangible reminder to avoid eating. Pro-mia bracelets, likewise, are blue or purple.<ref>{{citation|title = A sick trade|first = Judy|last = Skatssoon|newspaper = [[The Age]]|date = 2004-09-07|accessdate = 2009-04-21|url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/06/1091732078038.html?oneclick=true | location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title = Blood red bangle fosters cult of secret self-starving|url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/blood-red-bangle-fosters-cult-of-secret-selfstarving-470064.html|first = Barbara|last = McCormack|date = 2005-07-10|accessdate = 2009-04-21|newspaper = [[Irish Independent]]}}</ref> Most such bracelets are simple beaded items traded briskly on [[Online auction business model|online auction sites]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Bracelets Worn As Anorexic Status Symbol|url = http://www.kcra.com/news/4428694/detail.html|date = 2005-04-28|accessdate = 2009-04-21|publisher = [[KCRA]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Woman Makes, Sells Pro-Eating Disorder Bracelets|url = http://www.kcra.com/news/4433172/detail.html|date = 2005-04-29|accessdate = 2009-04-21|publisher = [[KCRA]]}}</ref>

== Impact ==

=== Proliferation ===
Pro-ana has proliferated rapidly on the Internet, with some observers noting a first wave of pro-ana sites on free web hosting services in the late 1990s,<ref name="brown" /><ref name="shade" /> and a second wave attributed to the recent rise of blogging and social networking services.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=e63f0b6c-eafd-4971-8d59-f8b777c31e0f|publisher = [[Canwest]]|date = 2008-06-03|title = Eating disorders rampant on social networking sites}}</ref>

A survey by Internet security firm [[Optenet]] found a 470% increase in pro-ana and pro-mia sites from 2006 to 2007.<ref>{{citation|title = 2008 International Internet Trends Study|publisher = Optenet|url = http://www.optenet.com/mailing/pdfs/TrendReport.pdf|accessdate = 2009-04-10|date = 2008-09-24}}</ref>  A similar increase was also noted in a 2006 [[Maastricht University]] study investigating alternatives to censorship of pro-ana material.  In the study, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] blog host punt.nl began in October 2006 presenting visitors to pro-ana blogs on its service with a click-through warning<ref>{{citation|title = Waarschuwing|url = http://waarschuwingstekst.punt.nl|publisher = punt.nl|accessdate = 2009-04-01}}</ref> containing a disparaging message and links to pro-recovery sites.  Although the warnings were a deterrence (33.6% of the 530,000 unique visitors logged did not proceed past the warning), the number of such blogs actually increased tenfold, with their monthly traffic figures doubling on average by the end of the study.<ref>{{citation|title = Minder bezoeken aan pro-ana-sites bij waarschuwing|url = http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/nederland/article2059453.ece/Minder_bezoeken_aan_pro-ana-sites_bij_waarschuwing.html|newspaper = [[Trouw]]|date = 2009-03-20|accessdate = 2009-04-01|language = Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{citation|doi = 10.1002/eat.20598|first1 = Carolien|last1 = Martijn|first2 = Elke|last2 = Smeets|first3 = Anita|last3 = Jansen|first4 = Nancy|last4 = Hoeymans|first5 = Casper|last5 = Schoemaker|title = Don't get the message: The effect of a warning text before visiting a proanorexia website|journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume = 42|pages = 139–145|year = 2009|publisher = Wiley|issue = 2|pmid = 18949766}}</ref>

=== Viewership ===
In a 2009 survey by the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] of 711 [[Flanders|Flemish]] high school students aged 13–17, 12.6% of girls and 5.9% of boys reported having visited pro-ana websites at least once.<ref name="leuven">{{citation|title = Viewership of pro-anorexia websites in seventh, ninth and eleventh graders|doi = 10.1002/erv.910|first1 = Kathleen|last1 = Custers|first2 = Jan|last2 = Van den Bulck|year = 2009|journal = European Eating Disorders Review|volume = 17|issue = 3|pmid = 19142974|pages = 214–219}}</ref>  In another 2009 survey, by parental control software vendor CyberSentinel of 1500 female Internet users aged 6–15, one in three reported having searched online for dieting tips, while one in five reported having corresponded with others on social networking sites or in chat rooms for tips on dieting.<ref>{{cite news|title = Skinny celebrities drive one in five 11-year-olds to diet|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/5193807/Skinny-celebrities-drive-one-in-five-11-year-olds-to-diet.html|date = 2009-04-21|accessdate = 2009-04-29|work = [[Daily Telegraph]] | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title = One in five 11-year-old girls search "pro-anorexia" websites for tips on staying skinny|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1172381/One-11-year-old-girls-search-pro-anorexia-websites-tips-staying-skinny.html|date = 2009-04-27|accessdate = 2009-04-29|newspaper = [[Daily Mail]]}}</ref>

Visitors to pro-ana web sites also include a significant number of those already diagnosed with eating disorders: a 2006 survey of eating disorder patients at [[Stanford Medical School]] found that 35.5% had visited pro-ana web sites;  of those, 96.0% learned new weight loss or purging methods from such sites (while 46.4% of viewers of pro-recovery sites learned new techniques).<ref>{{Citation|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Jenny|last2 = Peebles|first2 = Rebecka|month = December|year = 2006|title = Surfing for thinness: A pilot study of pro-eating disorder web site usage in adolescents with eating disorders|journal = Pediatrics|volume = 118|issue = 6|pages = e1635–e1643|doi = 10.1542/peds.2006-1133|last = Wilson|first = J L|pmid = 17142493|last3 = Hardy|first3 = KK|last4 = Litt|first4 = IF}}</ref>

=== Effect ===
Pro-ana sites can negatively impact the eating behavior of people with and without eating disorders. One study of individuals without eating disorders demonstrated that 84% of participants decreased caloric intake by an average of 2,470 calories (301 min -7851 max) per week after viewing pro-ED websites.<ref name=Jett>Jett, S., LaPorte, D. J., & Wanchisn, J. (2010). Impact of exposure to pro-eating disorder websites on eating behaviour in college women. European Eating Disorders Review, 18(5), 410-416. {{doi|10.1002/erv.1009}}</ref> Only 56% of participants actually perceived the reduction in their intake.<ref name=Jett/> Three weeks after the experiment, 24% of participants reported continuing weight control strategies from pro-ana websites, though they did not continue to visit those sites.<ref name=Jett/> Controls viewing health and travel websites did not decrease caloric intake at a significant level.<ref name=Jett/> Other studies have found that women with varying levels of eating disorder symptomatology were more likely to engage in image comparison and exercise after viewing pro-ana websites versus control websites.<ref name=Bardone1>{{citation|last1 = Bardone-Cone|first1 = A M|last2 = Cass|first2 = K M|year = 2007|title = What does viewing a pro-anorexia website do?

Pro-ana sites can negatively impact cognition and affect. Women who viewed a pro-ana site, but not control sites focused on fashion or home décor, experienced an increase in negative affect and decreases in self-esteem, appearance self-efficacy, and perceived attractiveness.<ref name=Bardone1/><ref name=Bardone2/> They also reported feeling heavier and being more likely to think about their weight.<ref name=Bardone1/><ref name=Bardone2/> The effects of perfectionism, BMI, internalization of the [[The Thin Ideal|thin ideal]], and pre-existing ED symptomatology as moderators of negative affect were comparable to chance, suggesting that pro-ana websites can affect a broad spectrum of individuals, not simply those with ED characteristics.<ref name=Bardone1/>

A 2007 survey by the [[University of South Florida]] of 1575 girls and young women found that those who had a history of viewing pro-ana websites did not differ from those who viewed only pro-recovery websites on any of the survey's measures, including [[body mass index]], negative body image, appearance dissatisfaction, level of disturbance, and dietary restriction. Those who had viewed pro-ana websites were, however, moderately more likely to have a negative body image than those who did not.<ref>{{citation|title = Viewership of pro-eating disorder websites: Association with body image and eating disturbances|first1 = Kelley|last1 = Harper|first2 = Steffanie|last2 = Sperry|first3 = J Kevin|last3 = Thompson|journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume = 41|pages = 92–95|year = 2008|doi = 10.1002/eat.20408|last = Wilson|first = J L|issue = 1|pmid = 17634964}}</ref>

Similarly, girls in the 2009 Leuven survey who viewed pro-ana websites were more likely to have a negative body image and be dissatisfied with their body shape.<ref name="leuven" />

A 2012 report by Deloitte Access Economics, commissioned by Australian non-profit The Butterfly Foundation, estimated that eating disorders resulted in productivity losses totaling just over $AUD15 billion, with 1828 (515 males and 1313 females) dying that year from eating disorder-related complications.<ref>{{citation|url = http://thebutterflyfoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Butterfly_Report.pdf|title = Paying The Price: The economic and social impact of eating disorders in Australia|date = 2012-11-29|publisher = Butterfly Foundation}}</ref>

===Social support v. exacerbation of illness===
Unlike pro-ana sites, pro-recovery sites are designed to encourage development and maintenance of healthy behaviors and cognitions. A study of pro-ana and pro-recovery website use among adolescents with eating disorders found that adolescents used both types of websites to further eating disordered behaviors.<ref name=Wilson>{{citation|first1 = Jenny L|last1 = Wilson|first2 = Rebecka|last2 = Peebles|first3 = Kristina K|last3 = Hardy|first4 = Iris F|last4 = Litt|title = Surfing for thinness: A pilot study of pro-eating disorder web site usage in adolescents with eating disorders|journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]|year = 2006|volume = 118|issue = 6|pages = e1635-e1643|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/6/e1635.full|doi = 10.1542/peds.2006-1133|pmid=17142493}}</ref> Those who viewed pro-ana sites were comparable to those who viewed pro-recovery sites with respect to appearance dissatisfaction, restriction, and bulimic behaviors.<ref name=Wilson/> Over half of parents were unaware of any ED website usage.<ref name=Wilson/>

=== Medical profession ===
Health care professionals and medical associations have taken generally negative views of pro-ana groups and the information they disseminate:<ref name="bbc-1">{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7259143.stm|publisher = BBC News|title = Pro-anorexia site clampdown urged|date = 2008-02-24|accessdate = 2008-02-25}}</ref>

* The [[National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders]] (ANAD) states that Pro-Ana sites "can pose a serious threat to some individuals, not simply because they promote eating disorder behaviors, but because they build a sense of community that is unhealthy.  They lure the impressionable and persuade them that the Pro-Ana community is providing caring and nurturing advice."<ref>{{cite web|title = Eating Disorders and the Internet|url = http://www.anad.org/get-information/eating-disorders-and-the-internet/|publisher = National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders|accessdate = 2010-09-07}}</ref>
* The Academy for Eating Disorders (AED) takes the position that "websites that glorify anorexia as a lifestyle choice play directly to the psychology of its victims", expressing concern that sites dedicated to the promotion of anorexia as a desirable "lifestyle choice" "provide support and encouragement to engage in health threatening behaviors, and neglect the serious consequences of starvation."<ref>{{cite web|title = Position Statement on Pro-Anorexia Web Sites|url = http://aedweb.org/policy/pro-anorexia_sites.cfm|accessdate = 2007-11-06|publisher = Academy for Eating Disorders |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014045846/http://aedweb.org/policy/pro-anorexia_sites.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}</ref>  However, one of its board members, Eric van Furth, has noted that pro-ana sites have relatively few visitors and advises against legal sanction of such sites, claiming instead that popular media play the more important role in establishing ideals of female thinness.<ref>{{citation|last = Esser|first = Luuk|title = Anorexia-sites weinig bezocht|newspaper = [[de Volkskrant]]|date = 2008-04-17|page = 3|url = http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article527915.ece/Anorexia-sites_weinig_bezocht|accessdate = 2008-07-03|language = Dutch}}</ref>
* Bodywhys (the Eating Disorders Association of Ireland) notes that pro-ana sites "might initially help people to feel less isolated, but the community that they create is an unhealthy community that encourages obsessiveness and minimization of the seriousness of these potentially deadly disorders."<ref>{{citation|title = Statement On Pro-anorexia Websites|url = http://www.bodywhys.ie/news.php?id=34|publisher = Eating Disorders Association of Ireland|date = May 2005|accessdate = 2009-05-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071119011838/http://www.bodywhys.ie/news.php?id=34 |archivedate = November 19, 2007}}</ref>
* b-eat (the [[Eating Disorders Association|Eating Disorders Association of the UK]]) has remarked that those who seek out pro-ana sites do so "to find support, understanding and acceptance.

* The UK [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] has called for the Council of Child Internet Safety—a UK government advisory body—to expand its definition of harmful online content to include pro-ana sites, and to inform parents and teachers of the dangers of pro-ana, arguing that "the broader societal context in which pro-ana and pro-mia sites thrive is one where young women are constantly bombarded with toxic images of supposed female perfection that are impossible to achieve, make women feel bad about themselves and significantly increase their risk of eating disorders."<ref>{{citation|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8261268.stm|publisher = BBC|accessdate = 2010-07-15|date = 2009-09-17|title = Call to get tough on eating sites}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title = Psychiatrists urge action to tackle 'pro-ana' websites danger|accessdate = 2010-07-15|date = 2009-09-18|url = http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/press/pressreleases2009/proanawebsites.aspx|first = Deborah|last = Hart|publisher = [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]}}</ref>

=== Media ===
In October 2001, ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' hosted a special on anorexia; the pro-ana movement was discussed briefly by the guest panel, who expressed alarm at the appearance of pro-ana websites and recommended the use of filtering software to bar access to them.<ref name="oprah-1"/>

In July 2002, the ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'' published an investigative report into pro-ana on the web.<ref>{{cite news|title = Misery Loves Company - Introducing the Pro-Anorexia Web, Where the Ultimate Control Freaks Find Friendship|work = [[Baltimore City Paper]]|last = Davis|first = Natalie|date = 2002-07-24|url = http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3413|accessdate = 2009-01-10}}</ref>

"Growing up Online", a January 2008 episode of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' television program, also featured a brief discussion of pro-ana.<ref>{{cite web|title = Growing up online|work = [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]|date = 2008-01-22|accessdate = 2008-04-04|url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kidsonline}}</ref>

In April 2009, ''The Truth about Online Anorexia'', an investigative documentary about pro-ana on the Internet, aired on [[ITV1]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] presented by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Fearne Cotton]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/article2367421.ece|title = Fearne on pro-ana site shock|first = Emma|last = Cox|date = 2009-04-09|accessdate = 2009-04-10|work = [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}</ref>

In April 2012 speech at Harvard University, [[Vogue Italia]] editor Franca Sozzani conceded that the fashion industry may be a cause of the recent rise in eating disorders, but that the industry was being unfairly singled out for blame: "How can all this be possibly caused by fashion? And how come that Twiggy, who would be surely considered an anorexic today, did not arise controversy in the Sixties and did not produce a string of anorexia followers?"  According to Sozzaine, pro-ana sites were more effective at promoting eating disorders, and [[obesity]] was the more pressing public health problem that food industry was not being likewise attacked for exacerbating.<ref>{{citation|url = http://www.vogue.it/en/magazine/editor-s-blog/2012/04/april-3rd|date = 2012-04-02|publisher = [[Vogue Italia]]|title = My Harvard Speech|first = Franca|last = Sozzani}}</ref>

[[File:thirty-two kilos (5).jpg|thumb|An image from Ivonne Thein's ''Thirty-two kilos'', a collection of digitally altered photographs satirizing thinspiration.]]

''Thirty-two kilos'', an [[art exhibition|exhibition]] by photographer Ivonne Thein, went on display at the [[Berlin]] [[:de:Postfuhramt|Postfuhramt art exhibition center]] in May 2008<ref>{{cite web|title = Ivonne Thein and Heide Häusler: Thirty-Two Kilos|first = Tom|last = Felber|accessdate = 2009-04-23|work = Creative Face Magazine|url = http://creativeface.net/berlin_co-berlin_10021-0}}</ref> and the [[Washington DC|Washington]] [[Goethe-Institut]] in January 2009, featuring photographs of young women digitally manipulated to appear skeletally thin.  The photographs were intended as a [[mockery|mocking]] and [[satire|satirical]] take on pro-ana. To Thein's dismay, however, many images from the exhibition were nevertheless later shared online as thinspiration.<ref>{{citation|title = Thirty-Two Kilos: A Stark Look at Anorexia|newspaper = [[Washington Post]]|first = Rachel|last = Beckman|date = 2009-01-08|accessdate = 2009-04-23|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/07/AR2009010703387.html}}</ref>

=== Social networking services ===
In July 2001, [[Yahoo]]—after receiving a letter of complaint from ANAD—began removing pro-ana sites from its Yahoo Clubs (now [[Yahoo Groups]]) service, stating that such sites endorsing [[self-harm]] were violations of its terms of service agreement.<ref>{{citation|last = Holahan|first = Catherine|date = 2001-09-04|title = Yahoo Removes Pro-Eating Disorder Internet Sites|newspaper = [[Boston Globe]]}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title = Anorexia Goes High Tech|first = Jessica|last = Reaves|url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,169660,00.html|magazine = [[Time Magazine]]|date = 2001-07-31|accessdate = 2007-11-11}}</ref>

[[LiveJournal]] has not made a position statement on pro-ana.  In August 2007, however, a staff member declined to act on an abuse report filed against a pro-ana community hosted on its network, stating that: "Suspending pro-anorexia communities will not make anyone suffering from the disorder become healthy again. Allowing them to exist, however, has several benefits.  It reassures those who join them that they are not alone in the way they feel about their bodies.  It increases the chance that the friends and loved ones of the individuals in the community will discover their disorders and assist them in seeking professional help."<ref>{{cite web|title = LiveJournal forum thread|url = http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/241428.html?thread=12329748#t12329748|date = 2007-09-07|accessdate = 2007-11-11|author = LiveJournal user [http://thevelvetsun.livejournal.com thevelvetsun]}}</ref>

[[Facebook]] staff seek out and regularly delete pro-ana related groups.

[[MySpace]] does not ban pro-ana material and has stated that "it's often very tricky to distinguish between support groups for users who are suffering from eating disorders and groups that might be termed as 'pro' anorexia or bulimia.  Rather than censor these groups, we are working to create partnerships with organisations like b-eat."  MySpace has chosen instead to cycle [[web banner|banner advertisements]] for pro-recovery organizations through pro-ana members' profiles.<ref name="bbc-1" />

In November 2007, [[Microsoft]] shut down four pro-ana sites on the [[Spanish-language]] version of its [[MSN Spaces|Spaces]] social networking service at the behest of IQUA, the Internet regulatory body for [[Catalonia]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Nueva ofensiva contra páginas pro anorexia y bulimia|language = Spanish|url = http://www.iqua.net/?go=S3iJ27PQ09INywzsO3FyalSoH3yDxSSX+1VQGEz7ZjalkPdWyhbnGEcwa7kvOKg=|publisher = La Agencia de Calidad de Internet (IQUA)|accessdate = 2007-11-30|date = 2007-11-21}}</ref>  A Microsoft spokesperson stated that such sites "infringe all the rules on content created by users and visible on our sites".<ref>{{citation|title = Online anorexia sites shut down amid claims they glorify starvation|url = http://timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article2916356.ece|first = Thomas|last = Catan|date = 2007-11-22|accessdate = 2007-11-30|newspaper = [[The Times]] | location=London}}</ref>

In April 2008, a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] outlawing material which "provokes a person to seek excessive thinness by encouraging prolonged restriction of nourishment" was tabled in the [[French National Assembly]] by [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] MP [[Valérie Boyer]].
