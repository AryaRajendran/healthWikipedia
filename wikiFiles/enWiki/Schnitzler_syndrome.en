'''Schnitzler syndrome''' is a [[rare disease]] characterised by [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[hives]] (urticaria) and periodic [[fever]], [[bone pain]] and [[arthralgia|joint pain]] (sometimes with [[arthritis|joint inflammation]]), [[weight loss]], [[malaise]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[swollen lymph glands]] and [[hepatosplenomegaly|enlarged spleen and liver]].<ref name="pmid17586002">{{cite journal |author=de Koning HD, Bodar EJ, van der Meer JW, Simon A |title=Schnitzler syndrome: beyond the case reports: review and follow-up of 94 patients with an emphasis on prognosis and treatment |journal=Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=137–48 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17586002 |doi=10.1016/j.semarthrit.2007.04.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049-0172(07)00073-X}}</ref>

The urticarial rash is non-[[itching]] in more than half of cases, which is unusual for hives. It is most prominent on the trunk, arms and legs, sparing the palms, soles, head and neck. Associated [[angioedema]] has been reported in a few patients. A review of 94 cases found a mean age at onset of 51 years, and only four patients developed symptoms before the age of 35.<ref name="pmid17586002"/> The cause and disease mechanism of Schnitzler syndrome remain largely unknown.<ref name="pmid17586002"/>

Schnitzler syndrome is considered an [[autoimmune disorder]]. Chronic hives and a [[monoclonal gammopathy]] have been proposed as the major criteria, while the others represent minor criteria.<ref name="pmid11204501">{{cite journal |author=Lipsker D, Veran Y, Grunenberger F, Cribier B, Heid E, Grosshans E |title=The Schnitzler syndrome. Four new cases and review of the literature |journal=Medicine |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11204501 |doi= 10.1097/00005792-200101000-00004|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0025-7974&volume=80&issue=1&spage=37}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Blood test]]s show a high concentration of specific [[gamma-globulins]] (monoclonal gammopathy) of the [[IgM]] type. It almost always has [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chains]] of the κ-type. A variant in which [[IgG]] is raised has been described, which appears to be ten times as rare. The immunoglobulins may show up in the urine as [[Bence Jones protein]]s. Signs of inflammation are often present: these include an increased [[white blood cell]] count ([[leukocytosis]]) and a raised [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] and [[C-reactive protein]]. There can be [[anemia of chronic disease]].<ref name="pmid11204501"/> Bone abnormalities can be seen on [[radiology|radiological imaging]] (often increased density or [[osteosclerosis]]) or [[biopsy]].

Because it is such a rare condition (less than 100 cases reported in the literature worldwide before 2008), it is important to rule out [[differential diagnosis|other conditions]] which can cause periodic fevers, paraproteins or chronic hives. These include (and are not limited to) auto-immune or -inflammatory disorders such as [[adult-onset Still's disease]], [[angioedema]], hematological disorders such as [[lymphoma]] or [[monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance]], other causes of hives, [[cryoglobulinemia]], [[mastocytosis]], chronic [[neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease]] or [[Muckle-Wells syndrome]].
It is however possible to have more than one rare condition as seen by a patient with Schnitzler's syndrome and cold induced urticaria.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886751</ref>

==Prognosis==
The life span in patients with Schnitzler syndrome has not been shown to differ much from the general population.<ref name="pmid17586002"/> Careful follow-up is advised, however. A significant proportion of patients develops a lymphoproliferative disorder as a complication, most commonly [[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia]]. This may lead to symptoms of [[hyperviscosity syndrome]]. [[AA amyloidosis]] has also been reported in people with Schnitzler syndrome.

==Treatment==
[[Antihistamines]] are not effective in treating the hives in this condition. It may respond to [[immunosuppressant]] drugs such as [[corticosteroids]], [[cyclooxygenase inhibitors]], [[interferon alpha]], [[interleukin 1 receptor antagonist]]s ([[Anakinra]]),<ref name="pmid16096327">{{cite journal |author=de Koning HD, Bodar EJ, Simon A, van der Hilst JC, Netea MG, van der Meer JW |title=Beneficial response to anakinra and thalidomide in Schnitzler's syndrome |journal=Annals of the rheumatic diseases |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=542–4 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16096327 |doi=10.1136/ard.2005.045245 |url=http://ard.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16096327 |pmc=1798111}}</ref> perfloxacin, [[colchicine]], [[cyclosporine]] or [[thalidomide]]. The hives may respond to treatment with [[PUVA]], and the bone pain may respond to [[bisphosphonates]].

Because Schnitzler's syndrome is so rare, the efficacy of different treatments cannot be compared using statistics. Nevertheless, case studies provide evidence that anakinra (otherwise known as kineret) is much more effective for Schnitzler's syndrome than any other drug, and that the improvement in symptoms associated with this treatment is dramatic. For example, Beseda and Nossent (2010)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beseda E|coauthors=Nossent H|title=Dramatic response to IL1_RA treatment in longstanding multidrug resistant Schnitzler’s syndrome: a case report and literature review|journal=Clinical Rheumatology|year=2010|month=May|volume=29|issue=5|pages=567–71}}</ref>  reviewed the literature concerning IL1-RA treatment (i.e. anakinra) for Schnitzler's syndrome. They concluded that, “Twenty-four patients with Schnitzler's syndrome... have been successfully treated with anakinra.” They add that “seven out of seven patients [with Schnitzler’s syndrome], that either interrupted or used anakinra every other day, had relapse of their symptoms within 24-48 h; anakinra was restarted in all patients with the same clinical efficiency.” Kluger et al. (2008) investigated the effectiveness of anakinra for a range of conditions. They searched MEDLINE for English-language trials of anakinra and abstracts from rheumatologial scientific meetings. They conclude that, “Over the last few years it has become increasingly evident that anakinra is highly effective and safe in patients with ... Schnitzler’s syndrome”. The year before, De Koning et al. (2007)<ref>{{cite journal|last=De Koning H|coauthors=Bodar EJ, van der Meer JWM, Simon A, Schnitzler Syndrome Study Group|title=Schnitzler Syndrome: Beyond the Case Reports: Review and Follow-Up of 94 Patients with an Emphasis on Prognosis and Treatment.|journal=Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism|year=2007|month=Dec|volume=37|issue=3|pages=137–48}}</ref>  reviewed the disease characteristics of Schnitzler syndrome and collected follow-up information to gain insight into long-term prognosis and treatment efficacy. They used data from 94 patients, and their conclusions about treatment for the condition are that, “There have been promising developments in therapeutic options, especially antiinterleukin-1 treatment, which induced complete remission in all 8 patients treated so far.”

Reports of individual patients treated with anakinra illustrate its effectiveness. Beseda and Nossent (ibid.) report treating a longstanding multidrug resistant Schnitzler’s syndrome patient with anakinra: “Within 24 h after the first injection, both the urticaria and the fever disappeared and have not recurred. For the past 6 months, the patient has been in clinical and biochemical remission.” Other authors report “a complete resolution of symptoms” (Dybowski et al., 2008).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dybowski F|coauthors=Sepp N, Bergerhausen HJ, Braun J|title=Successful use of anakinra to treat refractory Schnitzler’s syndrome|journal=Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology|year=2008|month=Mar-Apt|volume=26|issue=2|pages=354–7}}</ref> Crouch et al. (2007)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crouch R|coauthors=Akhras V, Sarkany R|title=Schnitzler’s syndrome: successful treatment with anakinra.|journal=Australiasian Journal of Dermatology|year=2007|month=Aug|volume=48|issue=3|pages=178–81}}</ref>   report the effective treatment of a 52 year old man who had been diagnosed with Schnitzler’s syndrome 8 years earlier: “On review, one week later, the patient’s systemic symptoms had resolved, and his previously elevated white cell count and inflammatory markers had normalised. The use of anakinra in our patient resulted in resolution of symptoms and has enabled cessation of oral prednisolone. Our patient remains symptom free on anakinra after 14 months of follow-up”. Similar stories are reported by Frischmeyer-Guerrerio et al. (2008),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frischmeyer-Guerrerio PA|coauthors=Rachamalla R, Saini SS|title=Remission of Schnitzler’s syndrome after treatment with anakinra.|journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology|year=2008|month=June|volume=100|pages=617–9}}</ref> Wastiaux et al.

(2007).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schneider SW|coauthors=Gaubitz M, Luger TA, Bonsmann G|title=Prompt response of refractory Schnitzler syndrome to treatment with anakinra|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|year=2007|month=May Supplement|volume=56|issue=5|pages=120–22}}</ref> De Koning et al. (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=De Koning HD|coauthors=Bodar EJ, Simon A, van der Hilst JC, Netea MG, van der Meer JW|title=Beneficial response to anakinra and thalidomide in Schnitzler’s syndrome|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|year=2006|month=Apr|volume=65|issue=4|pages=542–4}}</ref>  treated three patients with Schnitzler’s syndrome with thalidomide and anakinra. Thalidomide was only effective for one of the three patients and was discontinued because of polyneuropathy. In contrast, for all three patients, anakinra “led to disappearance of fever and skin lesions within 24 hours. After a follow-up of 16-18 months, all patients are free of symptoms”. The authors concluded that anakinra as a treatment for Schnitzler’s syndrome “is preferable to thalidomide... as it has fewer side effects”.

As well as being more effective, anakinra is safer than the other treatments available for Schnitzler's syndrome. The Cochrane review entitled, ‘Anakinra for rheumatoid arthritis’ (Mertens and Singh, 2009<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mertens M|coauthors=Singh JA|title=Anakinra for rheumatoid arthritis Art. No.: CD005121, CD005121.pub3.|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2009|issue=1|doi=10.1002/14651858}}</ref> ) evaluates the (clinical effectiveness and) safety of anakinra in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, using data from  2876 patients, from five trials which constituted 781 randomized to placebo and 2065 to anakinra. The authors conclude, “There were no statistically significant differences noted in most safety outcomes with treatment with anakinra versus placebo - including number of withdrawals, deaths, adverse events (total and serious), and infections (total and serious). Injection site reactions were significantly increased, occurring in 1235/1729 (71%) versus 204/729 (28%) of patients treated with anakinra versus placebo, respectively”. These injection site reactions last for no more than four months, and are trivial compared to the very debilitating symptoms of Schnitzler's syndrome.
