In [[epigenetic]]s, a '''paramutation''' is an interaction between two [[allele]]s at a single [[Locus (genetics)|locus]], whereby one allele induces a heritable change in the other allele. The change may be in the pattern of [[DNA methylation]], for example. The allele inducing the change is said to be paramutagenic, whilst the allele that has been epigenetically altered is termed paramutant (or paramutated). This change is [[Meiosis|meiotically]] inheritable, and therefore paramutation violates [[Mendelian genetics|Mendel’s first law]].

A paramutant allele may have altered levels of [[gene expression]], which may continue in offspring which inherit that allele, even though the paramutagenic allele may no longer be present. Through proper breeding, paramutation can result in sibling plants that have the same genetic sequence, but with drastically different [[phenotype]]s. 

Paramutation can result in a single allele of a gene controlling a spectrum of phenotypes. At ''r1'' in [[maize]], for example, the weaker expression state adopted by a paramutant allele can range from completely colorless to nearly fully colored kernels. This is an exception to the general observation that [[quantitative trait locus|traits that vary along a continuum]] are usually controlled by multiple genes. 

==History==
Paramutation was first discovered and studied in [[maize]] (''Zea mays'') by [[Royal Alexander Brink|R.A. Brink]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in the 1950s. Brink noticed that specific weakly expressed alleles of the ''red1'' ''(r1)'' locus in maize, which encodes a [[transcription factor]] that confers red pigment to [[corn kernels]], can heritably change specific strongly expressed alleles to a weaker expression state. The weaker expression state adopted by the changed allele is heritable and can, in turn, change the expression state of other active alleles in a process termed '''secondary paramutation'''. Brink showed that the influence of the paramutagenic allele could persist for many generations.

==Mechanism==
The molecular basis of paramutation is being unravelled almost exclusively in [[maize]]. Paramutation may share common mechanisms with other [[epigenetic]] phenomena, such as [[gene silencing]] and [[genomic imprinting]]. In maize, paramutation seems to share many traits with the well understood [[RNA-Directed DNA Methylation|RNA-directed DNA-methylation]] pathway in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', even though it has never been observed in that species. In maize: <blockquote>''"paramutation is RNA-directed. Stability of the chromatin states associated with paramutation and transposon silencing requires the mop1 gene, which encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alleman M, Sidorenko L, McGinnis K, ''et al.'' |title=An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is required for paramutation in maize |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7100 |pages=295–8 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16855589 |doi=10.1038/nature04884}}</ref></blockquote> Exactly how the [[RNA]] produced by this [[polymerase]] causes paramutation in maize is not yet understood, but like other epigenetic changes, it involves the covalent modification of DNA and/or the DNA-bound [[histone]] proteins without changing the DNA sequence itself.

==Occurrence==
Allelic interactions similar to paramutation have since been reported in other organisms, including [[tomato]]s, [[pea]]s, and [[mouse|mice]].
