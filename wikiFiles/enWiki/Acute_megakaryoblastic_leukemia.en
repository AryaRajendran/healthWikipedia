'''Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia''' (AMKL) is a form of [[leukemia]] where a majority of the blasts are [[megakaryoblastic]].<ref name="titleFinal Diagnosis -- Case 439">{{cite web |url=http://path.upmc.edu/cases/case439/dx.html |title=Final Diagnosis -- Case 439 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080224081941/http://path.upmc.edu/cases/case439/dx.html| archivedate= 24 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

It is classified under [[Acute_myelogenous_leukemia#French-American-British_classification|M7]] in the [[French-American-British classification]].<ref name="urlAcute Myeloid Leukemia - Signs and Symptoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/cancer/leukemia/conditions/aml/signs.html |title=Acute Myeloid Leukemia - Signs and Symptoms |work=}}</ref>

This category of AML is associate with 30% or more blasts in the marrow, blast are identified as being of megakaryocyte lineage by; Expression of megakaryocyte specific antigens and platelet peroxidase reaction on electron microscopy.

==Causes==
It is associated with [[GATA1]], and risks are increased in individuals with [[Down syndrome]].<ref name="pmid12586620">{{cite journal |author=Hitzler JK, Cheung J, Li Y, Scherer SW, Zipursky A |title=GATA1 mutations in transient leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia of Down syndrome |journal=Blood |volume=101 |issue=11 |pages=4301–4 |year=2003 |pmid=12586620 |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-01-0013 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12586620}}</ref>

==Signs and Symptoms==
In adults include pancytopenia with low blast counts in the blood, myelofibrosis, an absence of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, poor response to chemotherapy,and short clinical course.
In children; the same clinical presentation but with variable course especially in very young children; both leukocytosis and organomegaly may be present in children with M7. Complete remission and long term survival are more common in children than adults.
In the first three years of life megakaryoblastic leukemia is the most common type of leukemia in patients with Downs syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hitzler | first1 = JK | title = Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in Down syndrome | journal = Pediatric blood & cancer | volume = 49 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 1066–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17943965 | doi = 10.1002/pbc.21353 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The morphology of cells was observed by means of bone marrow smear; the immunophenotype was detected by [[flow cytometry]] and [[immunohistochemistry]] assay.<ref name="pmid17605859">{{cite journal |author=Lei Q, Liu Y, Tang SQ |title=[Childhood acute megakaryoblastic leukemia] |language=Chinese |journal=[[Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=528–32 |year=2007 |pmid=17605859 |doi=}}</ref>

In blood and bone marrow smears megakaryoblasts are usually medium sized to large cells with a high [[NC ratio|nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio]]. Nuclear [[chromatin]] is dense and homogeneous. There is scanty, variable basophilic cytoplasm which may be vacuolated. An irregular cytoplasmic border is often noted in some of the megakaryoblasts and occasionally projections resembling budding atypical platelets are present. Megakaryoblasts lack [[myeloperoxidase]] activity and stain negatively with Sudan black B. They are alpha naphthyl butyrate esterase negative and manifest variable alpha naphythyl acetate esterase activity usually in scattered clumps or granules in the cytoplasm. PAS staining also varies from negative to focal or granular positivity, to strongly positive staining. A marrow aspirate is difficult to obtain in many cases because of variable degree of [[myelofibrosis]]. More precise identification by immunophenotyping or with electron microscopy (EM). Immunophenotyping using MoAb to megakaryocyte restricted antigen ([[CD41]] and [[CD61]]) may be diagnostic.<ref name="pmid12239137">{{cite journal |author=Vardiman JW, Harris NL, Brunning RD |title=The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of the myeloid neoplasms |journal=[[Blood (journal)|Blood]] |volume=100 |issue=7 |pages=2292–302 |year=2002 |pmid=12239137 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-04-1199 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12239137}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends on cause.  One third of cases is associated with a t(1;22)(p13;q13) mutation in children.  These cases carry a poor prognosis.<ref>Huret JL . [http://AtlasGeneticsOncology.org/Anomalies/t0122.html t(1;22)(p13;q13)]. Atlas Genet Cytogenet Oncol Haematol.</ref>

Another third of cases is found in Down syndrome.  These cases have a reasonably fair prognosis.

The last third of cases may be heterogeneous, and carry a poor prognosis.<ref>Cuneo A, Cavazzini F, Castoldi GL .
