'''Nexplanon / Implanon NXT''', or the almost identical '''Implanon''', is a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant made by [[Merck & Co.]] that is inserted just under the skin of a woman's upper arm and contains etonorgestrel. Nexplanon/Implanon are a type of [[long-acting reversible contraception]], the most effective form of birth control.<ref name=Winner2012>{{citation

===Insertion and removal===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SubdermalImplant2011.jpg|thumb|right|Subdermal Implant]] -->
An experienced clinician must perform the insertion of Nexplanon or Implanon to ensure proper insertion and minimize the risk of nerve damage or misplacement, which could result in pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Wechselberger G, Wolfram D, Pulzl P, Soelder E, Schoeller T | title=Nerve injury caused by removal of an implantable hormonal contraceptive | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | year=2006 | month=July | volume=195 | issue=1 | pages=323–6 | pmid=16813761 | doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2005.09.016}}</ref> Before insertion, the arm is washed with a cleaning solution and a local anesthetic is applied to the upper arm around the insertion area.<ref name=Ray2007 /> A needle-like applicator is used to insert the rod under the skin into the subdermal tissue on the inner side of the arm between the biceps and triceps muscles.<ref name=Ray2007 /> The average time for insertion is 0.5 to 1 minute.<ref name=Funk2005>{{cite journal|coauthors=Funk S, Miller MM, Mishell DR Jr, Archer DF, Poindexter A, Schmidt J, Zampaglione E; Implanon US Study Group|title=Safety and efficacy of Implanon, a single-rod implantable contraceptive containing etonogestrel|journal=Contraception|year=2005|month=May|volume=71|issue=5|pages=319–26|pmid=15854630|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2004.11.007|last1=Funk|first1=Sidney}}</ref><ref name=Flores2005>{{citation

}}</ref> A bandage should be kept on the insertion site for 24 hours afterwards. Bruising and mild discomfort are common after insertion.<ref name=Ray2007 /> Serious insertion site complications such as infection can occur very rarely, in less than 1% of patients. If a woman receives an implant outside the first five days of her period, she should wait to have sex or use a backup method of contraception (such as a [[condom]], [[female condom]], [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]], sponge, or [[emergency contraception]]) for the following week after insertion to prevent pregnancy. However, if the implant is inserted during the first five days of a woman's period, she is protected for that cycle and beyond.<ref name="bedsider.org">Bedsider (2010). "Implant." Retrieved from http://bedsider.org/methods/implant#how_to_tab on March 17, 2011.</ref>

Nexplanon and Implanon should be removed after three years; however, they can be removed at any time if pregnancy is desired. The rod must also be removed by an experienced clinician. At removal, a local anesthetic is again used around the implant area at the distal end.<ref name=Ray2007 /> If the provider cannot feel the implant, imaging tests may be necessary to locate the rod before it can be removed. A small incision is made in the skin over the end of the implant site. In some cases, a fibrous sheath may have formed around the implant, in which case the sheath must be incised.<ref name=Ray2007 /> The implant is removed using forceps. The removal procedure lasts, on average, 3 to 3.5 minutes.<ref name=Funk2005 /><ref name=Flores2005 />

===Fertility after removal===
Within a week of removal, the hormones from the device leave the body and etonorgestrel is undetectable in most users.<ref name=Ray2007 /> Most women will begin to ovulate within six weeks of removal.<ref name=Maka1998 /><ref name=Davies1993>{{citation

Fertility levels will return to what they were before Nexplanon or Implanon insertion.

==Effectiveness==
Nexplanon and Implanon are a type of [[long-acting reversible contraception]], which has been shown to be the most effective form of birth control available.<ref name=Winner2012 /> The failure rate of Implanon is .05% for both perfect use and typical use because the method requires no user action after insertion.<ref name=Guttmacher>{{cite web |author=Guttmacher |title=Contraceptive Use in the United States |year=2012}}</ref> Prospective follow-up studies of Implanon, which include over 2,467 women-years of exposure, have found no pregnancies.<ref name=Ray2007 /><ref name=Kiri1999 /><ref name=Funk2005 /><ref name=Flores2005 /><ref name=Raj2004>{{citation

In comparison, tubal sterilization has a failure rate of 0.5% and IUDs have a failure rate of 0.2-0.8%.<ref name=Guttmacher /> These statistics suggest that Implanon and Nexplanon are almost ten times more effective at preventing pregnancy than tubal sterilization. Also, tubal sterilization is permanent, whereas the subdermal implant must be replaced every three years. On the other hand, Nexplanon or Implanon is completely reversible, while sterilization is permanent and cannot be reversed.

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism of action of [[progestin only contraceptives]] depends on the progestin activity and dose.<!--

Ovulation was not observed in studies of Implanon in the first two years of use and only rarely in the third year with no pregnancies. A secondary mechanism of action is the progestogenic increase in cervical mucus viscosity which inhibits sperm penetration.<!--

== Side effects and contraindications ==
===Side effects===
'''Irregular bleeding and spotting''': Many women will experience some type of irregular, unpredictable, prolonged, frequent, or infrequent bleeding when using Nexplanon or Implanon.<ref name=Adams2009 /> Some women also experience [[amenorrhea]]. For some women, prolonged bleeding will decline after the first three months of use. However, other women may experience this bleeding pattern through all three years of use. While these patterns are not dangerous, they are the most common reason that women give for discontinuing the use of the implant. After removal, bleeding patterns return to previous patterns in most women.<ref name=Ray2007 /><ref name=Kiri1999 /><ref name=Funk2005 /><ref name=Flores2005 /><ref name=Raj2004 /><ref name=Boo2004 /><ref name=Zheng1999 />

'''Insertion Complications''': Some minor side effects such as bruising, skin irritation, or pain around the insertion site are common.<ref name=Ray2007 /> However, there are some rare complications that can occur, such as infection or expulsion.<ref name=Ray2007 /><ref name=Smith2002>{{citation
 | author = Smith, A and Reuter, S
 | year = 2002
 | title = An assessment of the use of Implanon in three community services
 | journal = J Fam Plann Reprod Health Care
 | volume = 28
 | pages = 193–6
}}</ref> In some cases, a serious complication occurs when the provider fails to insert, and the rod is left in the inserter. An Australian study reported 84 (out of?) pregnancies as a result of such failure.<ref name=Harr1993 />

'''Migration''': Although very rare, the rod can sometimes move slightly within the arm. This can make removal more difficult. It is possible that insertion of an Implanon or Nexplanon in the same site as a previous implant increases the likelihood of migration.<ref name=Smith2002 /> Implanon rods can be located only through high-frequency ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<ref name=Ray2007 /> The Nexplanon rod is much easier to locate as a result of the inclusion of barium. Nexplanon may be located using traditional X-ray, CT-scan, ultrasound, or MRI.

'''Possible weight gain''': Some women may experience slight weight gain when using the implant.<ref name=Ray2007 /> However, current studies are not conclusive because they do not compare the weight of women using Implanon/Nexplanon with a control group of women not using the implant. The average increase in body weight in studies was less than 5 pounds over 2 years.<ref name=Kiri1999 /><ref name=Funk2005 /><ref name=Zheng1999 />

'''Ovarian cysts''': A small portion of women using Implanon/Nexplanon and other contraceptive implants develop ovarian cysts.<ref name=Ray2007 /> Usually these cysts will disappear without treatment.<ref name=Brache2002>{{citation

 | title = Nonmenstural adverse events during use of implantable contraceptives for women: data from clinical trials
 | journal = Contraception
 | volume = 65
 | pages = 63–74
}}</ref>

'''Drug interactions''': It is possible that the implant has similar drug interactions as combined oral contraceptives.<ref name=Ray2007 /> However, drug interactions with Implanon/Nexplanon have not been systematically studied.

'''Pregnancy''': it is recommended that Implanon or Nexplanon be removed if a pregnancy does occur. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the implant has a negative effect on pregnancy or a developing fetus.<ref name=Ray2007 />

'''Acne''': Acne has been self-reported to be a side effect of Implanon, and is listed as a side effect by the FDA. However, a study of Implanon users found that a majority of users with acne before their insertion reported that their acne had decreased, and only 16% of those who did not have acne before insertion developed acne.<ref name=Funk2005 />

'''Other possible symptoms''': Other symptoms that have been reported in clinical trials of Implanon or Nexplanon include headache, emotional lability, abdominal pain, loss of libido, and vaginal dryness.<ref name=Ray2007 /> However, there have been no studies that conclusively determine that these symptoms are caused by the implant.<ref name=Funk2005 /><ref name=Flores2005 />

* Are, or think they are, pregnant
* Are allergic to etonorgestrel
* Have a history of breast cancer
* Have vaginal bleeding that has not been explained
* Are breastfeeding in the first 6 weeks postpartum (see note)
* Have severe liver disease

There is some concern about women who develop ischemic heart disease, migraines with aura (spots or zig zag lines in vision), or stroke while using progestogen only contraception such as [[progestogen-only pill]]s (POP), the depo medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injection, and the implant.<ref name=WHOMEC /> However, these concerns are are less for the implant and POP and more for DMPA injection.

Implanon has also been shown to induce mild [[insulin resistance]] though the effects are not clinically relevant for healthy women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Biswas A, Viegas OA, Coeling Bennink HJ, Korver T, Ratnam SS |title=Implanon contraceptive implants: effects on carbohydrate metabolism |journal=Contraception |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=137–41 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11368985 |doi= 10.1016/S0010-7824(01)00182-2|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010782401001822}}</ref>

Note: There have been no studies to provide direct evidence that progestogen only contraception such as the implant has a negative effect on breast milk production or infants.<ref name=CDC2010 /> However, because of theoretical concerns about the impact on the development of infants less than 6 weeks of age, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends that the implant not be used until after 6 weeks postpartum.<ref name=WHOMEC /> The CDC lists breastfeeding under 4 weeks as a category 2 concern in which the benefits outweigh the risks, and cites no risk after 4 weeks postpartum.<ref name=CDC2010 />

A full list of contraindications can be found in the WHO ''Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 2009'' and the CDC ''United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 2010''

}}</ref> After a study that used implants with progestogens for contraception, the Population Council developed and patented [[Norplant]] and [[Jadelle]].<ref name=ARHP2008>{{cite web |author=Association of Reproductive Health Professionals |title=The Single-Rod Contraceptive Implant |year=July 2008 |html=http://www.arhp.org/publications-and-resources/clinical-proceedings/Single-Rod/History}}</ref> Norplant has six rods and is considered a first generation implant. Jadelle (Norplant II) and other single rod implants that followed were developed because of complications resulting from Norplants 6 rod system. The Jadelle system contains two silicone rods mixed with levonorgestrel. The single rods were less visible under the skin and used etonorgestrel as opposed to levonorgestrel in the hopes that it would reduce side effects.<ref name=Lapido2005 />

Norplant was used internationally beginning in 1983 and was marketed in the United States and the United Kingdom in 1993. There were many complications associated with Norplant insertion and removal in the United States and it was taken off the market in 2002. Although Jadelle was approved by the FDA, it has never been marketed in the United States, but it is widely used in Africa and Asia.<ref name=ARHP2008 /> Implanon was first used in Indonesia in 1998 and approved for use in the United States in 2006. Nexplanon was developed to eliminate the problem of non-insertion and localization of Implanon by changing the inserter device and making the rod radiopaque.<ref name=Mansour2010 /> Nexplanon has replaced Implanon in the UK because of cases of incorrect insertion. As of January 2012, Implanon is no longer being marketed in the US, and Nexplanon is the only available single-rod implant.
