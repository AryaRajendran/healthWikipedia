'''Juvenile polyposis syndrome''' is a syndrome characterized by the appearance of multiple juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract.  [[Polyp (medicine)|Polyps]] are abnormal growths arising from a [[mucous membrane]]. These usually begin appearing before age 20, but the term ''juvenile'' refers to the type of polyp, not to the age of the affected person.<ref name=NBK1469>{{harvnb|GeneReviews NBK1469}}</ref> While the majority of the polyps found in Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome are non-[[neoplastic]], [[hamartomatous]], self-limiting and benign, there is an increased risk of [[adenocarcinoma]]. 

Solitary juvenile polyps most commonly occur in the rectum and present with rectal bleeding. The [[World Health Organization]] criteria for diagnosis of juvenile polyposis syndrome are one of either:
# More than five juvenile polyps in the colon or rectum; or
# Juvenile polyps throughout the [[gastrointestinal tract]]; or
# Any number of juvenile polyps in a person with a family history of juvenile polyposis.<ref name="Sternberg">{{cite book |author=Stoler, Mark A.; Mills, Stacey E.; Carter, Darryl; Joel K Greenson; Reuter, Victor E. |title=Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2009 |isbn=0-7817-7942-1 }}</ref>

== Presentation ==

Age of onset is variable. The term 'Juvenile' in the title of Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome refers to the histological type of the polyps rather than age of onset. 

Affected individuals may present with rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhea or anemia. On [[colonoscopy]] or [[sigmoidoscopy]] polyps that vary in shape or size are present. The polyps can be sessile or pedunculated hamartomatous polyps.<ref name=NBK1469/>

Most juvenile polyps are benign, however, [[malignancy]] can occur. Lifetime risk of developing cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract in people with Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome ranges from 9% to 50%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Howe JR, Roth S, Ringold JC, ''et al.'' |title=Mutations in the SMAD4/DPC4 gene in juvenile polyposis |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5366 |pages=1086–8 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9582123 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5366.1086 }}</ref>

== Genetics ==
Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome can occur sporadically in families or be inherited in an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant manner]]. 

Two [[gene]]s associated with Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome are [[BMPR1A]] and [[SMAD4]].<ref name=NBK1469/> Gene testing may be useful when trying to ascertain which non-symptomatic family members may be at risk of developing polyps, however having a known familial mutation would be unlikely to change the course of treatment. A known mutation may also be of use for affected individuals when they decide to start a family as it allows them reproductive choices.

While [[mutation]]s in the gene [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] were also thought to have caused Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome, it is now thought that mutations in this gene cause a similar clinical picture to Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome but are actually affected with [[Cowden syndrome]] or other phenotypes of the [[PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome]].

== Prognosis ==
Solitary polyps have no significant risk of [[cancer]].  But multiple polyps (>5), polyposis syndrome, of the colon carries a 10% risk of developing into cancer.  This is mainly because of juvenile polyps developing [[adenomatous]] tissue.

== Screening and treatment==
People with juvenile polyps may require yearly upper and lower [[endoscopies]] with polyp excision and [[cell biology|cytology]].  Their siblings may also need to be screened regularly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  [[Malignant]] transformation of polyps requires surgical [[colectomy]].
