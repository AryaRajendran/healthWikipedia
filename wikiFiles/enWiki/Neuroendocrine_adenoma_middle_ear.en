}}</ref>  The various names have created some confusion about this uncommon middle ear tumor. Regardless of the name applied, the ''middle ear'' anatomic site must be known or confirmed.

== Signs and symptoms ==
This uncommon tumor accounts for less than 2% of all ear tumors.  While patients present with symptoms related to the middle ear cavity location of the tumor, the tumor may expand into the adjacent structures ([[external auditory canal]], [[mastoid bone]], and [[eustachian tube]]).<ref name="Leong">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  Patients come to clinical attention with unilateral (one sided) [[hearing loss]], usually associated with decreased auditory acuity, and particularly [[conductive hearing loss]] if the ossicular bone chain ([[ossicles|middle ear bones]]) is involved.<ref name="Torske"/> [[Tinnitus]] (ringing), [[otitis media]], pressure or occasionally ear discharge are seen. At the time of otoscopic exam, the [[tympanic membrane]] is usually intact, with a fluid level or mass noted behind the ear drum. Even though this is a "neuroendocrine" type tumor, there is almost never evidence of neuroendocrine function clinically or by laboratory examination.

== Imaging findings ==
In general, an axial and coronal bone computed tomography study without contrast will yield the most information for this tumor. The tumor appears as a soft tissue mass usually within a well-aerated mastoid bone. The features of chronic otitis media are not usually seen. Bone invasion and destruction are usually not seen in this tumor which expands within the mesotympanum (middle ear cavity). Encasement of the ossicles is usually present. There may be an irregular margin at the periphery, especially if the tumor has been present for a long time, with associated bone remodeling.<ref name="Leong">{{cite journal

[[File:Ear_Neuroendocrine_Adenoma_Middle_Ear_H&E_LDRT.tif|thumb|A hematoxylin and eosin stained intermediate power showing an infiltrating tumor with glandular and neuroendocrine features in a neuroendocrine adenoma of the middle ear.]]
At the time of surgery, the tumor tends to peel away from the adjacent bones, although not the ossicles. It is usually fragmented, soft, rubbery and white to gray-tan. Due to the anatomic confines of the region, tumors are usually <1 cm.<ref name="Thompson"/>
The tumors arise below the surface, are unencapsulated, and have an infiltrative pattern of growth, composed of many different patterns (glandular, trabecular, cords, festoons, single cells). The tumor shows duct-like structures with inner luminal, flattend cells and outer, basal, cuboidal cells. The cells may have an eccentrically placed nucleus. The nuclear chromatin distribution is "salt-and-pepper", giving a delicate, fine appearance. Nucleoli are small with inconspicuous mitoses. There may be secretions in the gland tumor. It is possible to see a concurrent [[cholesteatoma]].<ref name="Torske"/>

=== Histochemistry ===
It is possible to see intracytoplasmic as well as luminal mucinous material highlighted by a [[Periodic acid-Schiff|Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)]] or [[Alcian blue]] stain.<ref name="Wassef">{{cite journal

Scanning electron microscopy shows two distinct cell types:
* Type A: Apical dark cells with elongated microvilli and secretory mucus granules;
* Type B: Basal cells with cytoplasmic, solid, dense-core [[neurosecretory]] granules.
In a few areas, transitional forms with features of both cell types may be present.<ref name="McNutt">{{cite journal

== Diagnosis ==
From a pathology perspective, several tumors need to be considered in the differential diagnosis, including [[paraganglioma]], [[ceruminous adenoma]], metastatic adenocarcinoma, and [[meningioma]].<ref name="Torske"/>

== Management ==
The tumor must be removed with as complete a surgical excision as possible. In nearly all cases, the ossicular chain must be included if recurrences are to be avoided. Due to the anatomic site of involvement, facial nerve paralysis and/or paresthesias may be seen or develop; this is probably due to mass effect rather than nerve invasion. In a few cases, reconstructive surgery may be required. Since this is a benign tumor, no radiation is required. Patients experience an excellent long term outcome, although recurrences can be seen (up to 15%),<ref name="Torske"/> especially if the ossicular chain is not removed.
