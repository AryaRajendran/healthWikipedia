'''Leukocyte adhesion deficiency''' (LAD), is a rare [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]] disorder characterized by [[immunodeficiency]] resulting in recurrent [[infection]]s.<ref name="titleLeukocyte Adhesion Deficiency: Immunodeficiency Disorders: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec13/ch164/ch164k.html |title=Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency: Immunodeficiency Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |accessdate=2008-03-01 |work=}}</ref> Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is divided into at least two subtypes: [[Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1|LAD1]] and [[Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-2|LAD2]].

==Characteristics==
LAD was first recognized as a distinct clinical entity in the 1970s. The classic descriptions of LAD included recurrent [[bacteria]]l [[infection]]s, defects in [[neutrophil]] [[cell adhesion|adhesion]], and a delay in [[umbilical cord]] sloughing. The defects in [[cell adhesion|adhesion]] result in poor [[neutrophil]] [[chemotaxis]], [[phagocytosis]], as well as [[neutrophilia]] .

Individuals with LAD suffer from [[bacteria]]l [[infection]]s beginning in the [[neonate|neonatal]] period. Infections such as [[omphalitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[gingivitis]], and [[peritonitis]] are common and often life-threatening due to the infant's inability to properly destroy the invading [[pathogen]]s.These individuals do not form abscess because granulocytes cannot migrate to the sites of infection.

==Cause and Genetics==

The most common type is LAD1.

The [[biological inheritance|inherited]] [[congenital disorder|molecular defect]] in patients with LAD is a deficiency of the β-2 [[integrin]] subunit, also called [[CD18]], of the [[leukocyte]] [[cell adhesion]] [[molecule]], which is found on [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]]. This subunit is involved in making three other [[protein]]s ([[LFA-1]], [[Integrin alphaXbeta2]], and [[Macrophage-1 antigen|Mac-1/CR3]]) This basically means that the [[gene]] creates a non-functioning protein. This results in the lack of LFA1 integrin which allows neutrophils to make their way out of the blood stream by adhering to the Ig family receptor ICAM on the apical surface of endothelial cells in the infected areas of the body (i.e. the [[lung]]s in [[pneumonia]]). The bacteria can then proliferate, leading to [[symptomatic]] [[infection]]. The infection can spread unimpeded and cause serious injury to important [[biological tissue|tissue]].

==Diagnosis==
Typically, [[diagnosis]] is made after several preliminary tests of [[immune]] function are made, including basic evaluation of the [[humoral immunity|humoral immune system]] and the [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated immune system]]. A [[white blood cell|WBC]] [[differential staining|differential]] will reveal extremely elevated levels of neutrophils (on the order of 6-10x normal) because they are unable to leave the [[blood vessel]]s.  Specific diagnosis is made through [[monoclonal antibody]] testing for CR3, one of the three complete proteins which fail to form properly as a result of β-2 integrin subunit deficiency.

==Treatment==
Once the diagnosis of LAD is made, [[bone marrow transplant]]ation is the current [[standard of care]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Vliet DN, Brandsma AE, Hartwig NG |title=Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency - a rare disorder of inflammation |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. |volume=145 |issue=50 |pages=2496–2500 |year=2004 |pmid=15638198 }}</ref> However, some progress has been made in [[gene therapy]], an active area of research.

==Epidemiology==
LAD is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 births. There is no described racial or ethnic predilection.
