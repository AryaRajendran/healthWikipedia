'''Continuous passive motion''' (CPM) devices are used during the first phase of rehabilitation following a soft tissue surgical procedure or trauma.  The goals of phase 1 rehabilitation are: control post-operative pain, reduce inflammation, provide passive motion in a specific plane of movement, and protect the healing repair or tissue.  CPM is carried out by a CPM device, which constantly moves the joint through a controlled [[range of motion]]; the exact range is dependent upon the joint, but in most cases the range of motion is increased over time.

CPM is used following various types of reconstructive joint surgery such as [[knee replacement]] and [[ACL reconstruction]]. Its mechanisms of action for aiding joint recovery are dependent upon what surgery is performed.  One mechanism is the movement of [[synovial fluid]] to allow for better diffusion of nutrients into damaged [[cartilage]] (which would be unimportant in the event of joint replacement), and [[diffusion]] of other materials out; such as blood and metabolic waste products.  Another mechanism is the prevention of fibrous [[scar]] tissue formation in the joint, which tends to decrease the range of motion for a joint. The concept was created by [[Robert B. Salter]] M.D in 1970 and, along with help from engineer [[John Saringer]], a device was created in 1978.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salter RB |title=The biologic concept of continuous passive motion of synovial joints.

==CPM Following Knee Arthroplasty==
There is controversy concerning the effectiveness of CPM following Knee [[Arthroplasty]].  Some studies support it, while others show little or no effect when compared with [[placebo]].  One assessment of multiple studies indicates that CPM following knee arthroplasty gives a total benefit of 0.69 days less in the hospital and 4 more degrees of motion (only at 2 weeks of follow-up) than [[physical therapy]] alone.  This assessment further suggested that consideration must also be given to patient convenience and CPM cost.<ref>Brosseau L, Milne S, Wells G, Tugwell P, Robinson V, Casimiro L, Pelland L, Noel MJ, Davis J,
