'''Dr. John Wigan''' (31 January 1696 &ndash; 5 December 1739) was a prominent British physician, poet and author of the early eighteenth century whose writings and translations were popular and widely referred to during the period. He served as principal of [[New Inn Hall]] at [[Oxford University]] between 1726 and 1732 and was  physician of [[Westminster Hospital]] between 1733 and 1738. In 1738 he travelled to [[Jamaica]] with [[Edward Trelawny (governor)|Edward Trelawny]] and died there a year later in December 1739.

John Wigan was born in 1696, the son of William Wigan, rector of [[Kensington]]. At 14, Wigan was admitted to [[Westminster School]] and from there moved to [[Christ Church, Oxford]] where he obtained his BA, MA And MD. In 1726, during his final year of studies he was made principal of [[New Inn Hall]] and was already a celebrated writer on medical topics and poet. His 1723 translation of the works of [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] was widely remarked on and was used as the basis of [[Herman Boerhaave]]'s work on the same topic. His poetry was well received and was published in the "Carmina quadragesimalia" and elsewhere.<ref name="ODNB"/>

In 1731, Wigan was admitted to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] and moved to Craig's Court in [[London]].
