__NOTOC__
'''Confusion''' (from [[Latin]] ''confusĭo, -ōnis'', noun of action from ''confundere'' "to pour together", or "to mingle together"<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/confusion</ref> also "to confuse") is the state of being bewildered or unclear in one’s mind about something:<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/confusion</ref>

==Medical term==
"Acute Mental Confusion" is used interchangeably with [[Delirium]]<ref>http://www.symptomfind.com/symptoms/confusion/</ref> in [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] and [[Medical Subject Headings]] to describe a [[pathological]] degree in which it usually refers to loss of [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]] (ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time,<ref name=thefreedictionary>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mental+confusion thefreedictionary.com > confusion (redirected from mental confusion)] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier, Inc.</ref> location,<ref name=thefreedictionary/> and/or personal identity<ref name=thefreedictionary/>) sometimes accompanied by disordered [[consciousness]]<ref name=thefreedictionary/> and often [[memory]] (ability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material). Confusion as such is not synonymous with inability to focus [[attention]], although severe inability to focus attention can cause, or greatly contribute to, confusion. Together, confusion and inability to focus attention (both of which affect ''judgment'') are the twin symptoms of a ''loss'' or ''lack'' of normal brain function (cognition).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The milder degrees of confusion as pathological symptoms are relative to previous function. Thus (for example) a mathematician confused about manipulation of simple [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] may be showing [[pathology]] which would not be diagnosable in a person without training in this area. Thus, as with the case of delirium, the minor degrees of pathological confusion cannot be diagnosed without knowledge of a person's "baseline", or normal, level of mental functioning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Signs and symptoms==
Confusion is a symptom, and it may range from mild to severe. The confused state may include jumbled or disorganized [[thought]] and unusual, bizarre, or [[aggressive]] [[behavior]]s. A person who is confused may have difficulty solving problems or tasks, especially those known to have been previously easy for the person and an inability to recognize family members or familiar objects, or to give approximate location of family members not present. As well, they may appear to be disoriented, drowsy, hyperactive, or anxious. In severe cases, the person may have [[hallucination]]s, feelings of [[paranoia]], and a state of [[delirium]].

== Causes ==
Confusion may result from drug side effects.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2124215/Why-dont-GPS-warn-statins-harm-memory.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | work=Daily Mail | first=Jo | last=Waters | title=Why don't GPS warn you that statins can harm your memory?}}</ref>

Confusion may result from a relatively ''sudden'' brain dysfunction. Acute confusion is often called [[delirium]] (also called ''acute confusional state''<ref>[http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Acute-Confusional-State.htm patient.co.uk > Acute Confusional State] Writer: Dr Gurvinder Rull. Document ID: 1714. Document Version: 22. Document Reference: bgp2104. Last Updated: 13 Jan 2009</ref>), although delirium also includes a broader array of disorders than confusion, e.g. inability to focus attention and various impairments in awareness and temporal and spatial orientation.

Confusion may also result from chronic organic brain pathologies such as [[dementia]]. In either case, confusion is usually associated with some degree of loss of ability to focus attention, but (as noted) the association is not invariable, especially for lesser degrees of impairment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Many health problems may cause the syndromes of [[delirium]] or [[dementia]]. These syndromes may also occur together, and both of them usually include the symptom of confusion. Since mental function is extremely sensitive to health, the appearance of either a new confused state, or a new loss of ability to focus attention (delirium), may indicate that a new physical or mental [[illness]] has appeared, or that a chronic physical or mental illness has progressed (become more severe).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Differential diagnosis===
{{further|Differential diagnosis}}

The most common causes of drug induced acute confusion are [[dopaminergic]] drugs used for [[Parkinson's disease]], [[diuretics]], [[tricyclic antidepressants|tricyclic]] or [[tetracyclic antidepressants]] and [[benzodiazepines]]. The elderly and especially those with pre-existing dementia are at most risk for drug induced acute confusional states.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hufschmidt |first1=A. |last2=Shabarin |first2=V. |last3=Zimmer |first3=T. |title=Drug-induced confusional states: the usual suspects? |journal=[[Acta Neurologica Scandinavica]] |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=436–8 |month=Dec |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.2009.01174.x |pmid=19804475}}</ref>

New research is finding a link between [[Vitamin D]] deficiencies and [[cognitive impairment]] which includes [[memory loss]] and a foggy brain.<ref>[http://www.thirdage.com/brain-fitness/vitamin-d-linked-to-cognitive-impairment Third Age Vitamin D Deficiency]</ref>
