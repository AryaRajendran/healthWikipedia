'''Chikungunya''' (in the [[Makonde language]] "that which bends up") virus (CHIKV) is an [[arbovirus|arthropod-borne virus]], of the genus ''[[Alphavirus]]'', that is transmitted to humans by virus-carrying ''[[Aedes]]'' [[mosquitoes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lahariya C, Pradhan SK |title=Emergence of chikungunya virus in Indian subcontinent after 32 years: a review |journal=J Vect Borne Dis |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=151–60 |date=December 2006 |doi= |url=http://www.mrcindia.org/journal/issues/434151.PDF |format=PDF}}</ref> There have been recent breakouts of CHIKV associated with severe illness. 

CHIKV infection causes an illness with symptoms similar to [[dengue fever]], with an acute [[febrile]] phase of the illness lasting only two to five days, followed by a prolonged [[arthralgia|arthralgic]] disease that affects the joints of the extremities. The pain associated with CHIKV infection of the joints persists for weeks or months, or in some cases years.<ref name=Powers>{{cite journal |author=Powers AM, Logue CH |title=Changing patterns of chikungunya virus: re-emergence of a zoonotic arbovirus |journal=J.

==Signs and symptoms==
The incubation period of chikungunya disease ranges from one to twelve days, usually two to three. Its symptoms include a fever up to {{convert|40|°C|°F}}, a [[petechial]] or [[maculopapular rash|maculopapular]] [[rash]] of the trunk and occasionally the limbs, and arthralgia or arthritis affecting multiple joints.<ref name=pmid18227590>{{cite journal |author=Chhabra M, Mittal V, Bhattacharya D, Rana U, Lal S |title=Chikungunya fever: a re-emerging viral infection |journal=Indian J Med Microbiol |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=5–12 |year=2008 |pmid=18227590 |doi= |url=http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2008;volume=26;issue=1;spage=5;epage=12;aulast=Chhabra}}</ref> Other [[nonspecific symptoms]] can include [[headache]], [[conjunctivitis]], slight [[photophobia]] and partial [[loss of taste]].<ref name="After effects of Chikungunya Fever">{{cite web |url=http://www.onlymyhealth.com/after-effects-chikungunya-fever-1300445384 |title=After effects of Chikungunya Fever |author=Vatsal Anand |date=18 March 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> 

Typically, the fever lasts for two days and then ends abruptly. However, other symptoms—namely joint pain, intense headache, [[insomnia]] and an extreme degree of prostration—last for a variable period; usually for about five to seven days.<ref name=pmid18227590/> Patients have complained of joint pains for much longer time periods; some as long as two years, depending on their age.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simon F, Parola P, Grandadam M, Fourcade S, Oliver M, Brouqui P, Hance P, Kraemer P, Ali Mohamed A, de Lamballerie X, Charrel R, Tolou H |title=Chikungunya infection: an emerging rheumatism among travelers returned from Indian Ocean islands.

===Diagnosis===
Common laboratory tests for chikungunya include [[RT-PCR]], virus isolation, and serological tests.
*Virus isolation provides the most definitive diagnosis, but takes one to two weeks for completion and must be carried out in [[biosafety level 3]] laboratories.<ref name="WHO diagnosis">{{cite web |url=http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section2246_12902.htm |title=WHO&nbsp;— Laboratory Diagnosis of Chikungunya Fevers |work= |accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> The technique involves exposing specific [[cell line]]s to samples from whole blood and identifying chikungunya virus-specific responses.

*RT-PCR using [[nested primer]] pairs is used to amplify several chikungunya-specific [[gene]]s from whole blood. Results can be determined in one to two days.<ref name="WHO diagnosis"/>

*Serological diagnosis requires a larger amount of blood than the other methods, and uses an [[ELISA]] assay to measure chikungunya-specific [[IgM]] levels. Results require two to three days, and [[false positive]]s can occur with infection via other related viruses, such as [[o'nyong'nyong virus]] and [[Semliki Forest virus]].<ref name="WHO diagnosis"/>

==Causes==
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
Chikungunya virus is indigenous to tropical Africa and Asia, where it is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, usually of the genus ''Aedes''. Chikungunya virus belongs to alphavirus genus of the [[Togaviridae]] family. It is an "Arbovirus" (Ar-arthropod, bo-borne).

CHIK fever epidemics are sustained by human-mosquito-human transmission.  The main virus reservoirs are monkeys, but other species can also be affected, including humans.<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web|url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/Health_Topics/Chikungunya_Fever/facts.aspx|title=Chikungunya—Fact sheet|accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=[[European Centre for Disease Prevention]] and Control|date=23 January 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>


==Pathophysiology==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

Human epithelial and endothelial cells, primarily [[fibroblast]]s and monocyte-derived [[macrophages]], are susceptible to infection. Lymphoid and monocytoid cells, primary [[lymphocyte]]s and [[monocyte]]s and monocyte-derived [[dendritic cell]]s are not susceptible to infection. Viral entry occurs through [[pH]]-dependent [[endocytosis]]. Infection is cytopathic and associated with the induction of [[apoptosis]] in the infected cell. 

Infection is highly sensitive to the antiviral activity of type I and II [[interferon]].

=== Type 1 Interferon ===

Upon infection with chikungunya, the host's fibroblasts will produce type 1 (alpha and beta) interferon.<ref>{{cite pmid|20123960|noedit}}</ref>  Mice that lack the interferon alpha receptor die in 2-3 days upon being exposed to 10<sup>2</sup> chikungunya PFU, while wild type mice survive even when exposed to as much as 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of the virus.<ref>{{cite pmid|20123960|noedit}}</ref> 
At the same time, mice that are partially type 1 deficient (IFN α/β +/-) are mildly affected and experience symptoms such as muscle weakness and lethargy.<ref>{{cite pmid|18282093|noedit}}</ref> Partidos et al 2011 saw similar results with the live attenuated strain CHIKV181/25 strain. However, rather than dying, the type 1 interferon deficient (IFN α/β -/-) mice were temporarily disabled and the partially type 1 interferon deficient mice did not have any problems. <ref>{{cite pmid|21300099|noedit}}</ref> 

Several studies have attempted to find the upstream components of the type 1 interferon pathway involved in the host's response to chikungunya infection. So far, no one knows the chikungunya specific pathogen associated molecular pattern.<ref name=pmid209 >{{cite pmid|20962078|noedit}}</ref> Nonetheless, IPS-1 - also known as Cardif, MAVS, and VISA - has been found to be an important factor. In 2011, White et al found that interfering with IPS-1 decreased the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 ([[IRF3]]) and the production of IFN-β.<ref name=pmid209 /> Other studies have found that [[IRF3]] and [[IRF7]] are important in an age-dependent manner. Adult mice that lack both of these regulatory factors die upon infection with chikungunya.<ref>{{cite pmid|22761364|noedit}}</ref> Neonates, on the other hand, succumb to the virus if they are deficient in one of these factors.<ref>{{cite pmid|22371392|noedit}}</ref> 
   
Chikungunya counters the Type I interferon response by producing NS2, a non-structural protein that degrades Rpb and turns off the host cell's ability to transcribe DNA.<ref>{{cite pmid|22514352|noedit}}</ref> NS2 interferes with the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]] and prevents STAT from becoming phosphorylated.<ref>{{cite pmid|20686047|noedit}}</ref>

==Prevention==
[[Image:Aedes aegypti biting human.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' mosquito biting a person.]]
There currently is no licensed vaccine to protect against chikungunya virus.  The most effective means of prevention are protection against contact with the disease-carrying mosquitoes and [[mosquito control]]. These include using [[insect repellent]]s with substances such as [[DEET]] (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide; also known as N,N'-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide or NNDB), [[icaridin]] (also known as picaridin and KBR3023), PMD ([[p-menthane-3,8-diol]], a substance derived from the lemon eucalyptus tree), or IR3535. Wearing bite-proof long sleeves and trousers (pants) also offers protection. 

In addition, garments  can be treated with [[pyrethroids]], a class of insecticides that often has repellent properties. Vaporized pyrethroids (for example in mosquito coils) are also insect repellents. Securing screens on windows and doors will help to keep mosquitoes out of the house. In the case of the day-active ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' and ''[[Aedes albopictus]]'', however, this will have only a limited effect, since many contacts between the vector and the host occur outside.

===Vaccine research===
Early-stage (phases 1 and 2) clinical trials have provided evidence in humans for safety and [[prophylactic]] efficacy of candidate vaccines, but these have not been developed further due to shifting research priorities.<ref>{{cite pmid|22100854|noedit}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:2012-01-09 Chikungunya on the right feet at The Philippines.jpeg|thumb|Chikungunya on the right foot.]]
There are no specific treatments for chikungunya, and no vaccine is currently available. A [[phases of clinical research|Phase II]] [[vaccine]] trial, sponsored by the US Government and published in the ''American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene'' in 2000, used a live, [[attenuated virus]], developing viral resistance in 98% of those tested after 28 days and 85% still showed resistance after one year.<ref name='AJTMH-Chikungugunya-Phase II'>{{cite journal |author=Edelman R, Tacket CO, Wasserman SS, Bodison SA, Perry JG, Mangiafico JA |title=Phase II safety and immunogenicity study of live chikungunya virus vaccine TSI-GSD-218 |journal=Am.

A [[serology|serological]] test for chikungunya is available from the [[University of Malaya]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

[[Chloroquine]] is gaining ground as a possible treatment for the symptoms associated with chikungunya, and as an anti-inflammatory agent to combat the arthritis associated with the virus. A [[University of Malaya]] study found that for [[arthritis]]-like symptoms not relieved by [[aspirin]] and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), [[chloroquine]] phosphate (250&nbsp;mg/day) has given promising results.<ref>[http://www.vadscorner.com/alphaviruses.html Alphaviruses<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Unpublished studies in cell culture and monkeys show no effect of chloroquine treatment on reduction of chikungunya disease. The fact sheet<ref name="factsheet" /> on chikungunya advises against using aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other NSAIDs that are recommended for arthritic pain and fever.

==Prognosis==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

Recovery from the disease varies by age.  Younger patients recover within 5 to 15 days; middle-aged patients recover in 1 to 2.5 months.  Recovery is longer for the elderly.  The severity of the disease as well as its duration is less in younger patients and pregnant women.  In pregnant women, no untoward effects are noticed after the infection.

Ocular inflammation from Chikungunya may present as [[iridocyclitis]], and have retinal lesions as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mahendradas P, Ranganna SK, Shetty R, ''et al.'' |title=Ocular manifestations associated with chikungunya |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=287–91 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=17631967 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2007.03.085 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0161-6420(07)00488-5}}</ref>

Pedal oedema (swelling of legs) is observed in many patients, the cause of which remains obscure as it is not related to any cardiovascular, renal or hepatic abnormalities.

==Epidemiology==
[[File:ChickV Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Cases of chikungunya fever (between 1952-2006) have been reported in the countries depicted in red on this map.]]

Chikungunya is generally spread through bites from ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' mosquitoes, but recent research by the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris has suggested chikungunya virus strains in the 2005-2006 Reunion Island outbreak incurred a mutation that facilitated transmission by [[Asian tiger mosquito]] (''Aedes albopictus'').<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin E |title=EPIDEMIOLOGY: Tropical Disease Follows Mosquitoes to Europe |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |pages=1485 |year=2007 |pmid=17872417 |doi=10.1126/science.317.5844.1485a}}</ref> 

Concurrent studies by arbovirologists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, confirmed definitively that enhanced chikungunya virus infection of ''A. albopictus'' was caused by a point mutation in one of the viral envelope genes (E1).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tsetsarkin KA, Vanlandingham DL, McGee CE, Higgs S |title=A Single Mutation in Chikungunya Virus Affects Vector Specificity and Epidemic Potential |journal=PLoS Pathog |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e201 |year=2007 |pmid=18069894 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030201 |pmc=2134949}}</ref><ref>[http://www.promedmail.org/pls/promed/f?p=2400:1202:13247582543695722866::NO::F2400_P1202_CHECK_DISPLAY,F2400_P1202_PUB_MAIL_ID:X,40398 ProMED-mail (2007) Chikungunya virus: genetic change.

In Africa, chikungunya is spread via a [[sylvatic cycle]] in which the virus largely resides in other [[primate]]s in between human outbreaks.<ref name="No Longer"/>

On 28 May 2009 in [[Trang Province|Changwat Trang]] of [[Thailand]] where the virus is endemic, the provincial hospital decided to deliver by [[Caesarean section]] a male baby from his chikungunya-infected mother, Khwanruethai Sutmueang, 28, a Trang native, to prevent mother-fetus virus transmission. However, after delivering the baby, the physicians discovered the baby was already infected with the virus, and put him into intensive care because the infection had left the baby unable to breathe by himself or to drink milk. The physicians presumed the virus might be able to be transmitted from a mother to her fetus, but without laboratory confirmation.<ref>[[Thai Rath|T Rath]] (2009).

The extant ECSA strains - which include the first isolate of this virus - evolved between 1924 and 1943. 

The Asian group split into two clades: an Indian lineage which has probably become extinct and a Southeast Asian lineage. The Southeast Asian lineage spread from [[Thailand]] to [[Indonesia]]; and then to the [[Philippines]] and more recently [[Malaysia]]. The recent Indian Ocean basin outbreak that began in 2004 appears to have originated from the ECSA group back in 2002 (95% credible interval: December 2001 to December 2003). 

The estimated overall mutation rate is 4.33 × 10<sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year - a rate similar to those found in other viruses with RNA genomes.<ref name="Volk2010"/>

==History==
{{Main|Chikungunya outbreaks}}

The word ''chikungunya'' is thought to derive from a description in the local [[Makonde]] dialect, meaning "that which bends up", of the contorted [[Human position|posture]]  of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain and [[arthritis|arthritic]] symptoms associated with this disease.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Chikungunya fever diagnosed among international travelers—United States, 2005–2006 |journal=MMWR Morb.

I. Clinical features |journal=Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |year=1955 |pmid=14373834|doi=10.1016/0035-9203(55)90080-8}}</ref> and W.H.R.

According to the initial 1955 report about the [[epidemiology]] of the disease, the term ''chikungunya'' is derived from the Makonde root verb ''kungunyala'', meaning to dry up or become contorted.  In concurrent research, Robinson [[Gloss (transliteration)|glossed]] the Makonde term more specifically as "that which bends up". Subsequent authors apparently overlooked the references to the Makonde language and assumed the term derived from [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the region.  The erroneous attribution of the term as a Swahili word has been repeated in numerous print sources. Many other erroneous spellings and forms of the term are in common use including "chicken guinea", "chicken gunaya," and "chickengunya".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Since its discovery in [[Tanganyika]], Africa, in 1952, chikungunya virus outbreaks have occurred occasionally in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, but recent outbreaks have spread the disease over a wider range.
