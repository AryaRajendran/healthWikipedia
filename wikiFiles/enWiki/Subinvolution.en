'''Subinvolution''' is a medical condition in which after [[childbirth]], the [[uterus]] does not return to its normal size.

==Definition==
When the involution is impaired or retarded it is called subinvolution. The uterus is the most common organ affected by subinvolution. As it is the most accessible organ to be measured per abdomen, the uterine involution is considered clinically as an index to assess subinvolution. 

==Causes==
===Predisposing factors===
# grand [[Parity_(biology)#Enumeration|multiparity]]
# overdistension of uterus as in twins and hydramnios
# ill maternal health
# [[caesarean section]] 
# [[uterine prolapse]] 
# retroversion after the uterus becomes pelvic organ 
# uterine fibroid

===Aggravating factors===
* Retained products of conception
* Uterine sepsis, endometritis 

==Factors==
* Persistent [[lochia]]/fresh bleeding
* Long labor
* [[anaesthesia]]
* full bladder
* difficult delivery
* retained placenta
* maternal [[infection]]

==Symptoms==
The condition may be asymptomatic. The predominant symptoms are: 
* Abnormal lochial discharge either excessive or prolonged 
* Irregular or at times excessive uterine bleeding
* Irregular cramp like pain is cases of retained products or rise of temperature in sepsis

==Signs==
The uterine height is greater than the normal for the particular day of [[puerperium]]. Normal puerperal uterus may be displaced by a full bladder or a loaded rectum. It feels boggy and softer upon palpation.

==Management==
* Antibiotics in endometritis 
* Exploration of the uterus in retained products 
* Ergometrine so often prescribed to enhance the involution process by reducing the blood flow of the uterus is of no value in prophylaxis.
