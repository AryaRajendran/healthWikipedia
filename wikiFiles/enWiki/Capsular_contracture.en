'''Capsular contracture''' is an abnormal response of the [[immune system]] to foreign materials in the human body. Medically, it occurs mostly in context of the [[Complications (medical)|complications]] from [[breast implant]]s and [[Joint replacement|artificial joint]] prosthetics.

The occurrence of capsular contraction follows the formation of capsules of tightly-woven [[collagen]] fibers, created by the [[immune response]] to the presence of foreign objects surgically installed to the human body, e.g. breast implants, [[artificial pacemaker]]s, [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic prostheses]]; biological protection by isolation and toleration. Capsular contracture occurs when the collagen-fiber capsule tightens and squeezes the breast implant; as such, it is a medical complication that can be very painful and discomforting, and might distort the aesthetics of the breast implant and the [[breast]]. Although the cause of capsular contracture is unknown, factors common to its incidence include [[bacteria]]l contamination, rupture of the [[breast implant|breast-implant]] shell, leakage of the silicone-gel filling, and [[hematoma]].

Moreover, because capsular contracture is a consequence of the immune system defending the patient’s bodily integrity and health, it might reoccur, even after the requisite corrective surgery for the initial incidence. The degree of an incidence of capsular contracture is graded using the four-grade Baker scale:

* Grade I 	— the breast is normally soft and appears natural in size and shape
* Grade II 	— the breast is a little firm, but appears normal
* Grade III — the breast is firm and appears abnormal
* Grade IV — the breast is hard, painful to the touch, and appears abnormal

The surgical implantation methods that have reduced capsular contracture include submuscular breast implant placement, using either textured or polyurethane-coated implants,<ref name="Barnsley2006">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000218184.47372.d5 |title=Textured Surface Breast Implants in the Prevention of Capsular Contracture among Breast Augmentation Patients: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials |year=2006 |last1=Barnsley |first1=G Philip |last2=Sigurdson |first2=Leif J. |last3=Barnsley |first3=Shannon E. |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=117 |issue=7 |pages=2182–90 |pmid=16772915}}</ref><ref name="Wong2006">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1097/01.prs.0000237013.50283.d2 |title= Capsular Contracture in Subglandular Breast Augmentation with Textured versus Smooth Breast Implants: A Systematic Review |year= 2006 |last1= Wong |first1= Chin-Ho |last2= Samuel |first2= Miny |last3= Tan |first3= Bien-Keem |last4= Song |first4= Colin |journal= Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume= 118 |issue= 5 |pages= 1224–36 |pmid= 17016195}}</ref><ref name="Handel2006">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asj.2006.04.001 |title=Long-term safety and efficacy of polyurethane foam-covered breast implants |year=2006 |last1=Handel |first1=N |last2=Gutierrez |first2=J |journal=Aesthetic Surgery Journal |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=265–74 |pmid=19338905}}</ref> limited handling of the implants, minimal contact with the chest wall skin before their insertions, and irrigating the surgical sites with triple-antibiotic solutions.<ref name="Mladick1993">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1007/BF00636260 |title= ?No-Touch?

The [[Mentor (company)|Mentor Worldwide LLC]] corporation, one of the two, U.S. FDA-approved breast-implant device manufacturers, conducted a study of the [[Complication (medical)|medical complication]]s suffered by breast implantation surgery patients. In March 2000, at a Food and Drug Administration presentation, the Mentor report indicated that 43 per cent of patients with saline breast implants reported medical complications occurring within three years of the surgery; moreover, 10 per cent of that percentage group complained of capsular contracture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
