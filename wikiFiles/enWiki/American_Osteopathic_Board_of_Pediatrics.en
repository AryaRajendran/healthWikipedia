==Board certification==
Osteopathic pediatricians are eligible for initial certification if they have successfully completed an AOA-approved [[medical residency|residency]] in pediatrics, an AOA membership that is in good standing, an unrestricted medical license in the state in which their practice is located, and must complete the required AOBP examinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aobp.org/AOBP%20Applicant%20Handbook%202013.pdf |title=AOBP Applicant Handbook |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics |accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>

Prior to 1995, the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics offered lifetime certificates to members recognized as board certified. However, the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics now requires osteopathic pediatricians to renew their certification every ten years to avoid expiration of their board certification status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aobp.org/recertification.shtml|title=Recertification |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics |accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>
