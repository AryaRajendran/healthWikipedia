===Single gene disorders===
{{See also|genetic disorder}}
There are many single gene [[genetic disorder]]s that differ in frequency between different populations due to the region, though many assume it to be solely based on race. Some examples are discussed below.

[[Cystic fibrosis]] is the most common life-limiting [[autosomal recessive]] disease among people of European heritage. 

[[Sickle-cell anemia]] is most prevalent in populations of sub-Saharan African ancestry, but it is also common among Latin-American, Indian, Saudi Arab, and Mediterranean populations such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy.<ref>http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/sca.shtml</ref><ref>Bloom, Miriam. ''Understanding Sickle Cell Disease.'' University Press of Mississippi, 1995. Chapter 2.</ref>

[[Tay-Sachs Disease]] is an autosomal recessive disorder that is more frequent among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] than among other Jewish groups and non-Jewish populations.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 5945951 | last1 = Myrianthopoulos  | author-separator =, | first1 = NC | author-name-separator=  | last2 = Aronson | first2 = SM | title = Population dynamics of Tay-Sachs disease.

[[Hereditary hemochromatosis]] is most common among those of Northern European ancestry, in particular those of Celtic descendent.

[[Lactose intolerance]] is another examples of single gene genetic disorders that differ in frequency between populations.<ref name="Lactose intolerance"/>

===Multifactorial polygenic diseases===
These are many diseases which differ in frequency between different populations.

===Disease progression===
{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}
Groups may differ in how a disease progresses.

===Prevention===
Different groups may require different preventive measures to prevent specific diseases. For example, disease prevention for melanoma, which can include proper use of sun screen and reducing the risks of sun exposure, could be targeted to groups that are much more likely to develop melanoma from sun exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/statistics/race.htm |title=Skin Cancer Rates by Race and Ethnicity |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref>

===Treatment===
{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}
Groups may differ in their responses to treatment.

=== Medicines targeted at specific races ===
{{See also|Pharmacogenomics}}
Race-based medicine is the term for medicines that are targeted at specific ethnic clusters which are shown to have a propensity for a certain disorder. The first example of this in the U.S. was when [[BiDil]], a medication for congestive heart failure, was licensed specifically for use in American patients that self-identify as black.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = AL | last2 = Ziesche | first2 = S | last3 = Yancy | first3 = C | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | last4 = Carson | first4 = P| year = 2004 | last5 = D'agostino Jr | first5 = R | last6 = Ferdinand | first6 = K | last7 = Taylor | first7 = M | last8 = Adams | first8 = K | last9 = Sabolinski | first9 = M| title = (November 2004).

After two trials, BiDil was licensed exclusively for use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely that it was more effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race based advertising scheme.<ref>Ellison, George (2006) Medicine in black and white: BiDil: race and the limits of evidence-based medicine. ''Significance'', Volume 3, Number 3, September 2006 , pp. 118–121(4)</ref>

Critics are concerned that the trend of research on race specific pharmaceutical treatments will result in inequitable access to pharmaceutical innovation and smaller minority groups may be ignored. This has led to a call for regulatory approaches to be put in place to ensure scientific validity of racial disparity in pharmacological treatment.<ref>Winichoff, D. E., Obasagie, O. K. (2008) Race-specific drugs: Regulatory trends in public policy. Trends in Pharmacological Sciences. http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=4110</ref>

==Environmental explanations==
In multiracial societies such as the [[United States]], racial groups differ greatly in regard to social and cultural factors such as [[socioeconomic status]], [[healthcare]], diet, and education.<ref name="collins"/> There is also the presence of [[racism]] which some see as a very important explaining factor.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=McKenzie K |title=Racism and health |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7380 |pages=65–6 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12521953 |pmc=1125019 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7380.65}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=LaVeist TA |title=On the study of race, racism, and health: a shift from description to explanation |journal=International Journal of Health Services |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=217–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10707307 |doi=10.2190/LKDF-UJQ5-W1KU-GLR1}}</ref> Some argue that for many diseases racial differences would disappear if all environmental factors could be controlled for. See the article about [[race and health in the United States]] for a discussion of such factors. These factors may or may not be appropriate in other nations.

Ethnic minorities may also have specific health care needs which need to be taken into consideration by health services in order to tackle health disparities.<ref>{{citation | first=Mark | last=Johnson | contribution=Ethnicity | series=Public Health Evidence: Tackling health inequalities | editor1-first=Amanda | editor1-last=Killoran | editor2-first=Catherine| editor2-last=Swann|editor3-first=Michael P.|editor3-last=Kelly|year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press| url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198520832.do}}</ref>

=== Health disparities ===

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of [[health]] and [[health care]] across [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[ethnic groups]].<ref>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The US [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] defines health disparities as "population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care."<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Janet |last1=Goldberg |first2=William |last2=Hayes |first3=Jill |last3=Huntley |month=November |year=2004 |title=Understanding Health Disparities |publisher=Health Policy Institute of Ohio |url=http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |page=3}}</ref> Health is measured through variables such as life expectancy and incidence of diseases.<ref name=Collins-2004 />

==Genetic explanations==

===Evolutionary explanations===
{{See also|Heterozygote advantage}}
Genes may be under strong selection in response to local diseases. For example, people who are [[duffy antigen|duffy negative]] tend to have higher resistance to malaria. Most Africans are duffy negative and most non-Africans are duffy positive.<ref>Malaria and the Red Cell,Harvard University. 2002 url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html</ref> A number of genetic diseases more prevalent in malaria-afflicted areas may provide some [[genetic resistance to malaria]] including [[sickle cell disease]], [[thalassaemias]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and possibly others.

[[Cystic_fibrosis#Theories_about_prevalence|Many theories about the origin of the cystic fibrosis]] have suggested that it provides a [[heterozygote advantage]] by giving resistance to diseases earlier common in Europe.

In earlier research a common theory was the [[Common disease-common variant|"common disease-common variant"]] model. It argues that for common illnesses, the genetic contribution comes from the additive or multiplicative effects of gene variants that each one is common in the population. Each such gene variant is argued to cause only a small risk of disease and no single variant is enough to cause the disease. An individual must have many of these common gene variants in order for the risk of disease to be substantial.<ref name="doi10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.032">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.032}}</ref>

More recent research indicates that the "common disease-rare variant" may be a better explanation for many common diseases. In this model, rare but higher-risk gene variants cause common diseases. This model may be particularly relevant for diseases that reduces fertility. In contrast, for common genes associated with common disease to persist they must either have little effect during the reproductive period of life (like Alzheimer's disease) or provide some advantage in the original environment (like genes causing autoimmune diseases also providing resistance against infections). In either case varying frequencies of genes variants in different populations may be an explanation for health disparities.<ref name="doi10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.032"/> Genetic variants associated with [[Alzheimer's]] disease, [[deep venous thrombosis]], [[Crohn disease]], and [[type 2 diabetes]] appear to adhere to "common disease-common variant" model.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lohmueller KE, Pearce CL, Pike M, Lander ES, Hirschhorn JN | year = 2003 | title = Meta-analysis of genetic association studies supports a contribution of common variants to susceptibility to common disease | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 177–182 | doi = 10.1038/ng1071 | pmid = 12524541 }}</ref>

===Gene flow===
[[Gene flow]] and [[admixture]] can also have an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders. Multiple sclerosis, for example, is typically associated with people of European descent, but due to admixture African Americans have elevated levels of the disorder relative to Africans.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15596747  | author-separator =, | last1 = Cree | first1 = BA | author-name-separator=  | last2 = Khan | first2 = O | last3 = Bourdette | first3 = D | last4 = Goodin | first4 = DS | last5 = Cohen | first5 = JA | last6 = Marrie | first6 = RA | last7 = Glidden | first7 = D | last8 = Weinstock-Guttman | first8 = B | last9 = Reich | first9 = D | title = Clinical characteristics of African Americans vs Caucasian Americans with multiple sclerosis | journal = Neurology| volume=63 | issue=11 | year=2004 | month=December | pages=2039–45 | doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000145762.60562.5D}}</ref>

Some diseases and physiological variables vary depending upon their admixture ratios. Examples include measures of [[insulin]] functioning<ref>Gower, B. A. ''et al.'' "Using genetic admixture to explain racial differences in insulin-related phenotypes," ''Diabetes'' 52, 1047–1051 (2003).</ref> and [[obesity]].<ref>Fernandez, J. R. ''et al.'' "Association of African genetic admixture with resting metabolic rate and obesity among women," ''Obes. Res.'' 11, 904-911 (2003).</ref>

=== Gene interactions ===
The same gene variant, or group of gene variants, may produce different effects in different populations depending on differences in the gene variants, or groups of gene variants, they interact with. One example is the rate of progression to [[AIDS]] and death in [[HIV]]&ndash;infected patients. In Caucasians and Hispanics, HHC [[haplotype]]s were associated with disease retardation, particularly a delayed progression to death. In contrast, for African Americans, possession of HHC haplotypes was associated with disease acceleration.<ref name=gonz1996>

==Controversy regarding race in biomedicine==
{{See also|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}

There is a controversy regarding race as a method for classifying humans. Different sources argue it is purely social construct or a biological reality reflecting average genetic group differences.  New interest in human biological variation has resulted in a resurgence of the use of race in biomedicine.<ref>Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Page 188. "Far from waning in the age of molecular genetics, race has been resurgent in biomedical discourse, especially in relation to a torrent of new interest in human biological variation and its quantification."</ref> 

The main impetus for this development is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of certain [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors, such as genetically conditioned health factors, on the basis of more easily ascertained characteristics such as phenotype and racial self-identification. Since medical judgment often involves decision-making under uncertain conditions,<ref name="whitmarsh 9">Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Chapter 9.</ref> many doctors consider it useful to take race into account when treating disease because diseases and treatment responses tend to cluster by geographic ancestry.<ref>Satel, Sally. [http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/magazine/i-am-a-racially-profiling-doctor.html "I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor"]. The New York Times, published May 5, 2002</ref> The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup.

Race in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.<ref name=Collins-2004>{{Cite journal|author=Collins FS |title=What we do and don't know about 'race', 'ethnicity', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=36 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=S13–5 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15507997 |doi=10.1038/ng1436}}</ref>

Taking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.<ref name="whitmarsh 9" />

The continued use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the continued use of racial categories in health care and as risk factors could result in increased [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and discrimination in society and health services.<ref name="collins"/><ref name="whitmarsh 5">Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press.

David Williams (1994) argued, after an examination of articles in the journal ''Health Services Research'' during the 1966-90 period, that how race was determined and defined was seldom described. At a minimum, researchers should describe if race was assessed by self-report, proxy report, extraction from records, or direct observation. Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator of socioeconomic status.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Williams DR |title=The concept of race in Health Services Research: 1966 to 1990 |journal=Health Services Research |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=261–74 |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=8063565 |pmc=1070005}}</ref> Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with and the role of the environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Goodman AH |title=Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health) |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1699–702 |year=2000 |month=November |pmid=11076233 |pmc=1446406 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.11.1699}}</ref>

=== From concepts of Race to Ethnogenetic Layering ===

There is general agreement that a goal of health-related genetics should be to move past the weak surrogate relationships of racial health disparity and get to the root causes of health and disease. This includes research which strives to analyze human genetic variation in smaller groups than races across the world.<ref name="collins">Collins, Francis S. ''What we do and don't know about 'race', 'ethnicity', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era.'' Nature Genetics Supplement, volume 36 No. 11, November 2004.</ref> 

One such method is called ethnogenetic layering. It works by focusing on geographically identified microethnic groups. For example, in the Mississippi Delta region ethnogenetic layering might include such microethnic groups as the Cajun (as a subset of European Americans), the Creole and Black groups [with African origins in Senegambia, Central Africa and Bight of Benin] (as a subset of African Americans), and Choctaw, Houmas, Chickasaw, Coushatta, Caddo, Atakapa, Karankawa and Chitimacha peoples (as subsets of Native American Indians).<ref>Jackson, F.L.C. Ethnogenetic layering (EL): an alternative to the traditional race model in human variation and health disparity studies. Annals of Human Biology, March–April 2008; 35(2): 121–144 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080%2F03014460801941752</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/bmb/ldh012}}</ref>

Better still may be individual genetic assessment of relevant genes.<ref name=JW2004/> However, until cheaper and more widely available methods of genetic analysis are commonplace, the consideration of race remains a worthwhile practice for many doctors and researchers.<ref name="collins"/> Even when such methods become commonly available, race will continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research.<ref name=JW2004>Jordge, Lynn B. and Stephen P. Wooding. "Genetic Variation, classification and 'race'". ''Nature'', Vol. 36 Num. 11, November 2004.</ref>

==Association studies==
{{See also|Genetic association}}
One area in which population categories can be important considerations in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. [[Association studies]] can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that are not related to the disease being studied,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cardon LR, Palmer LJ | year = 2003 | title = Population stratification and spurious allelic association | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9357| pages = 598–604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12520-2 | pmid = 12598158 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Marchini J, Cardon LR, Phillips MS, Donnelly P | year = 2004 | title = The effects of human population structure on large genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 512–517 | doi = 10.1038/ng1337 | pmid = 15052271 }}</ref> although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thomas DC, Witte JS | year = 2002 | title = Point: population stratification: a problem for case-control studies of candidate-gene associations? | url = | journal = Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 505–512 | pmid = 12050090 }}</ref><ref>

Population genetic substructure also can aid genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range [[linkage disequilibrium]] between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers than is the case for other populations.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hoggart CJ, Shriver MD, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2004 | title = Design and analysis of admixture mapping studies | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 965–978 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Patterson N, Hattangadi N, Lane B, Lohmueller KE, Hafler DA, Oksenberg JR, Hauser SL, Smith MW, O'Brien SJ ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Methods for high-density admixture mapping of disease genes | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 979–1000 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Smith MW, Patterson N, Lautenberger JA, Truelove AL, McDonald GJ, Waliszewska A, Kessing BD ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = , "A high-density admixture map for disease gene discovery in African Americans | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1001–1013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = McKeigue PM | year = 2005 | title = Prospects for admixture mapping of complex traits | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 1–7 }}</ref> Genetic studies can use this disequilibrium to search for disease alleles with fewer markers than would be needed otherwise. Association studies also can take advantage of the contrasting experiences of racial or ethnic groups, including migrant groups, to search for interactions between particular alleles and environmental factors that might influence health.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Chaturvedi N | year = 2001 | title = Ethnicity as an epidemiological determinant—crudely racist or crucially important? | url = | journal = Int J Epidemiol | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 925–927 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Collins FS, Green ED, Guttmacher AE, Guyer MS, US National Human Genome, Institute Research | year = 2003 | title = A vision for the future of genomics research | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 422 | issue = 6934| pages = 835–847 | doi=10.1038/nature01626 | pmid=12695777}}</ref>

==Human genome projects==
The [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] has collected genetic samples from 52 indigenous populations. This sampling has been controversial because some fear that racists might use the results, because the sampling might overemphasize genetic distinctions, because of informed consent issues, and patenting issues.<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/93/930608Arc3222.html Human Genome Diversity Project raises serious ethical issues]</ref><ref>''[http://www.hgalert.org/topics/personalInfo/hgdp.htm The Human Genome Diversity project]'' GenEthics News issue 10</ref><ref name="marks">Marks, J. (2002) ''What it means to be 98% chimpanzee'' (paperback ed.) pp.202-207. Berkley. University of California Press.</ref>

Several other [[genome project]]s also studies populations from around the world but often not as diverse.
