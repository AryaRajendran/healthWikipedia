'''Amlodipine''' ('''Norvasc''' (Pfizer) and generics)  (as [[besylate]], [[mesylate]] or [[maleate]]) is a long-acting [[calcium channel blocker]] [[dihydropyridine]] (DHP) class used as an [[antihypertensive]] and in the treatment of [[angina pectoris]]. Like other calcium channel blockers, amlodipine acts by relaxing the [[smooth muscle]] in the [[Artery|arterial wall]], decreasing [[total peripheral resistance]] thereby reducing [[blood pressure]]; in angina, amlodipine increases blood flow to the [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] (although DHP-class calcium channel blockers are more selective for arteries than the muscular tissue of the heart (myocardium), as the cardiac calcium channels are not of the dihydropyridine-type).

== Medical uses ==
Amlodipine is used in the management of [[hypertension]]<ref>{{cite journal | last=Wang|first=JG| title = A combined role of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers in stroke prevention| journal = Vascular health and risk management |volume=5  | issue=  | pages = 593–605|year=2009 | pmid=19688100|doi=  }}</ref> and [[coronary artery disease]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Amlodipine Besylate | url = http://www.amlodipinebesylatez.com/|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==

* [[Cardiogenic shock]]
* [[Unstable angina]]
* [[Aortic stenosis]]: Amlodipine causes vasodilation, which can result in reduced cardiac output in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

=== Cautions ===

* [[Hepatic]] impairment
* [[Pregnancy]]

===Interactions ===

* In patients with severe coronary artery disease, amlodipine can increase the frequency and severity of angina or actually cause a heart attack on rare occasions. This phenomenon usually occurs when first starting amlodipine, or at the time of dosage increase. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
* Excessive lowering of blood pressure during initiation of amlodipine treatment can occur, especially in patients already taking another medication for lowering blood pressure. In rare instances, congestive heart failure has been associated with amlodipine, usually in patients already on a beta blocker.
* Amlodipine is primarily metabolyzed by the liver, via the [[cytochrome P450]] isoenzyme [[CYP3A4]].<ref name="Norvasc monograph">{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.ca/en/our_products/products/monograph/129 |title=Product Monograph:Norvasc |format=PDF |work= |year=2012 |publisher=Pfizer Canada Inc' |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref>  As such, serum levels can potentially be affected by drugs which [[enzyme inhibition|inhibit]] or [[enzyme activation|activate]] CYP3A4. Grapefruit juice can inhibit the [[cytochrome P450]] system,<ref name="Norvasc monograph"/> but the predicted interaction risk with amlodipine is low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bailey DG, Dresser G, and Arnold JMA | title=Grapefruit and Medication Interactions: Forbidden Fruit or Avoidable Consequences? | journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal | year=2012 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.120951}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the movement of calcium ions into [[vascular smooth muscle]] cells and [[cardiac muscle cell]]s. Experimental data suggest amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative [[inotrope|inotropic]] effects, or decreased heart muscle contractility, can be detected ''in vitro'', but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.

Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

Amlodipine also acts as a functional inhibitor of [[Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase|acid sphingomyelinase]] ([[FIASMA]]).<ref name="pmid21909365">{{cite journal | author = Kornhuber J, Muehlbacher M, Trapp S, Pechmann S, Friedl A, Reichel M, Mühle C, Terfloth L, Groemer TW, Spitzer GM, Liedl KR, Gulbins E, Tripal P | title = Identification of novel functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = e23852 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21909365 | pmc = 3166082 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0023852 }}</ref>  [[Sphingomyelin]] is involved in [[signal transduction]] and [[apoptosis]], or cell death.

The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include:

; Exertional angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, so lowers myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.

; Vasospastic angina: Amlodipine has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium, [[epinephrine]], [[serotonin]], and [[thromboxane]] A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels ''in vitro''. This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine in vasospastic ([[Prinzmetal's angina|Prinzmetal's]] or variant) angina.

==Pharmacokinetics and metabolism==
The metabolism and excretion of amlodipine have been studied in healthy volunteers following oral administration of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled drug.<ref name="pmid2967593">{{cite journal | author = Beresford AP, McGibney D, Humphrey MJ, Macrae PV, Stopher DA | title = Metabolism and kinetics of amlodipine in man | journal = Xenobiotica | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–54 | year = 1988 | month = February | pmid = 2967593 | doi = 10.3109/00498258809041660 }}</ref> Amlodipine is well absorbed by the oral route with a mean oral bioavailability of approximately 60%. Renal elimination is the major route of excretion with about 60% of an administered dose recovered in urine, largely as inactive pyridine metabolites. The major metabolite identified was 2-([4-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methoxycarbonyl-6-methyl- 2-pyridyl]methoxy) acetic acid, and this represented 33% of urinary radioactivity. Amlodipine concentrations in plasma declined with a mean half-life of 33 h, while elimination of total drug-related material from plasma was slower.
