'''''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia''' ('''PCP''') or '''pneumocystosis''' is a form of [[pneumonia]], caused by the yeast-like [[fungus]] (which had previously been erroneously classified as a [[protozoa]]n) ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]''. <ref name=Aliouat-Denis_2008>{{cite journal | author=Aliouat-Denis, C-M., ''et al.'' |year=2008| title=''Pneumocystis'' species, co-evolution and pathogenic power| journal=Infection, Genetics & Evolution| volume=8| pages=708–726 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.05.001 | pmid=18565802 | issue=5}}</ref>

''Pneumocystis'' is commonly found in the lungs of healthy people, but, being a source of [[opportunistic infection]], it can cause a lung infection in people with a [[immunodeficiency|weak immune system]]. ''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia is especially seen in people with cancer, HIV/AIDS and the use of medications that affect the immune system.

The older name ''Pneumocystis carinii'' (which now only applies to the ''Pneumocystis'' species that is found in rats<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stringer JR, Beard CB, Miller RF, Wakefield AE |title=A new name (''Pneumocystis jiroveci'') for Pneumocystis from humans |journal=Emerging Infect.

As a result, ''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia (PCP) is also known as '''''Pneumocystis jiroveci[i]'' pneumonia''' and (incorrectly) as '''''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia'''.<ref name=Cushion_1998>{{cite book |author=Cushion MT |chapter=Ch. 34: ''Pneumocystis carinii'' |editor=Collier, L.; Balows, A.; Sussman, M. |title=Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections  |publisher=Arnold and Oxford Press |location=New York |year=1998  |pages=645–683 |edition=9th}}</ref><ref name=Cushion_1998b>{{cite journal | author=Cushion MT | title = Taxonomy, genetic organization, and life cycle of ''Pneumocystis carinii'' | journal = Semin.

Regarding nomenclature, when the name of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) changed from ''P. carinii'' pneumonia to ''P. jirovecii'' pneumonia, it was at first felt that "PJP" should replace "PCP". However, because the term PCP was already used among physicians that managed patients with Pneumocystis infection, it was rationalized that the term PCP could continue to be used, as it stood for '''P'''neumo'''C'''ystis (jirovecii) '''P'''neumonia.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of PCP include fever, non-productive cough (because sputum is too viscous to become productive), shortness of breath (especially on exertion), weight loss, and night sweats. There is usually not a large amount of [[sputum]] with PCP unless the patient has an additional bacterial infection. The fungus can invade other visceral organs (such as the [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[kidney]]), but only in a minority of cases.

[[Pneumothorax]] is a well-known complication of PCP. An acute history of chest pain with breathlessness and diminished breath sounds is typical of pneumothorax.{{fact|date=June 2012}}

===Disease course===
The risk of PCP increases when [[CD4]] positive cell levels are less than 200 cells/μl. In these [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] individuals the manifestations of the infection are highly variable.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hughes WT |chapter=''Pneumocystis Carinii''|title=Barron's Medical Microbiology|editor=Barron S, ''et al.''| edition = 4th | publisher = University of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996|chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4516 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 }}</ref> The disease attacks the interstitial, fibrous tissue of the lungs, with marked thickening of the alveolar septa and [[alveoli]], leading to significant [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] which can be fatal if not treated aggressively. In this situation [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] levels increase and gas exchange is compromised. Oxygen is less able to diffuse into the blood, leading to [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Hypoxia, along with high arterial [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) levels, stimulates [[ventilation (physiology)|hyper-ventilatory effort]], thereby causing [[dyspnea]] (breathlessness).

==Diagnosis==
[[File:PCPxray.jpg|thumb|X-ray of ''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' pneumonia. There is increased opacification (whiteness) in the lower lungs on both sides, characteristic of ''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia]]

The diagnosis can be confirmed by the characteristic appearance of the [[chest x-ray]], which shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates, and an [[arterial blood gas|arterial oxygen level]] (PaO<sub>2</sub>) that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. [[Gallium 67 scan]]s are also use in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the [[chest x-ray]] becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in [[sputum]] or [[bronchoalveolar lavage|bronchio-alveolar lavage]] (lung rinse). Staining with [[toluidine blue]], [[Grocott's methenamine silver stain|silver stain]], [[Periodic_acid-Schiff_stain|periodic-acid schiff stain]], or an [[immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence assay]] will show the characteristic [[cyst]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmb.leeds.ac.uk/mbiology/ug/ugteach/icu8/std/pcp.html |accessdate=5 June 2009 |title=Supplementary Information: Microscopic appearance of Pneumocystis jiroveci from bronchial washings}}</ref> The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and not to be confused with ''Histoplasma'' or ''Cryptococcus'', which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia. 

''Pneumocystis'' infection can also be diagnosed by [[immunofluorescence|immunofluorescent]] or [[Histochemistry|histochemical staining]] of the specimen, and more recently by molecular analysis of [[polymerase chain reaction]] products comparing [[DNA]] samples. Notably, simple molecular detection of ''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' in lung fluids does not mean that a person has ''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia or infection by [[HIV]]. The fungus appears to be present in healthy individuals in the general population.<ref name=Medrano_2005>{{cite journal |author=Medrano FJ, Montes-Cano M, Conde M, ''et al.'' |title=''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' in general population |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=245–50 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15752442 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no02/04-0487.htm}}</ref>

==Prevention==
In [[immunocompromised]] patients, [[prophylaxis]] with [[co-trimoxazole]] or regular [[pentamidine]] inhalations may help prevent PCP. 

==Treatment==
Antipneumocystic medication is used with concomitant [[steroids]] in order to avoid inflammation, which causes an exacerbation of symptoms about four days after treatment begins if steroids are not used. By far the most commonly used medication is [[co-trimoxazole|trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], but some patients are unable to tolerate this treatment due to allergies. Other medications that are used, alone or in combination, include [[pentamidine]], [[trimetrexate]], [[dapsone]], [[atovaquone]], [[primaquine]], [[pafuramidine maleate]] (under investigation), and [[clindamycin]]. Treatment is usually for a period of about 21 days.

[[Pentamidine]] is less often used as its major limitation is the high frequency of [[Adverse effect|side effect]]s. These include acute [[pancreatitis]], [[renal failure]], [[hepatotoxicity]], [[leukopenia]], [[rash]], [[fever]], and [[hypoglycaemia]].

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Pneumocystisjiroveci.jpg|thumb|Pneumocystis jirovecii]]
The disease PCP is relatively rare in people with normal immune systems, but common among people with weakened [[immune system]]s, such as premature or severely malnourished children, the elderly, and especially persons living with HIV/AIDS (in whom it is most commonly observed).<ref name= Aliouat-Denis_2008/><ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> PCP can also develop in patients who are taking [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressive medications]]. It can occur in patients who have undergone [[Organ transplant|solid organ transplantation]] or [[bone marrow transplantation]] and after surgery.<ref name="pmid19517677">{{cite journal |author=Puzio J, Kucewicz E, Sioła M,''et al.'' |title=[Atypical and opportunistic pulmonary infections after cardiac surgery.] |language=Polish|journal=Anestezjologia Intensywna Terapia |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=41–5 |year=2009 |pmid=19517677 }}</ref> Infections with ''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia are also common in infants with [[hyper IgM syndrome]], an X-linked or autosomal recessive trait.

The causative organism of PCP is distributed worldwide<ref name=Morris_2004>{{cite journal |author=Morris A, Lundgren JD, Masur H, ''et al.'' |title=Current epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=10|issue=10 |pages=1713–20 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15504255|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no10/03-0985.htm}}</ref> and ''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia has been described in all continents except Antarctica.<ref name=Morris_2004/> Greater than 75% of children are [[seropositive]] by the age of 4, which suggest a high background exposure to the organism. A post-mortem study conducted in Chile of 96 persons who died of unrelated causes (suicide, traffic accidents, and so forth) found that 65 (68%) of them had pneumocystis in their lungs, which suggests that asymptomatic pneumocystis infection is extremely common.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ponce CA, Gallo M, Bustamante R, Vargas SL |title=Pneumocystis colonization is highly prevalent in the autopsied lungs of the general population |journal=Clin Infect Dis |year=2010 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=347–353 |doi=10.1086/649868|pmid=20047487}}</ref>

''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' was originally described as a rare cause of [[pneumonia]] in [[neonate]]s. It is commonly believed to be a commensal organism (dependent upon its human host for survival). The possibility of person-to-person transmission has recently gained credence, with supporting evidence coming from many different genotyping studies of ''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' isolates from human lung tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmoldt S, Schuhegger R, Wendler T,''et al.'' |title=Molecular evidence of nosocomial ''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' transmission among 16 patients after kidney transplantation |journal=J.

===PCP and AIDS===

Since the start of the [[AIDS]] epidemic, PCP has been closely associated with AIDS. Because it only occurs in an immunocompromised host, it may be the first clue to a new AIDS diagnosis if the patient has no other reason to be immunocompromised (e.g. taking immunosuppressive drugs for [[organ transplant]]). An unusual rise in the number of PCP cases in North America, noticed when physicians began requesting large quantities of the rarely used antibiotic [[pentamidine]], was the first clue to the existence of AIDS in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal | title=A Cluster of Kaposi's Sarcoma and ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia among homosexual male residents of Los Angeles and Range Counties, California | author=Fannin S, Gottlieb MS, Weisman JD, ''et al.'' | year=1982 | journal=MMWR Weekly | volume=31 | issue=32| pages=305–7 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001114.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198112103052402 | author=Masur H, Michelis MA, Greene JB, ''et al.'' |title=An outbreak of community-acquired Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia |journal=N Engl J Med |date=10 December 1981|volume=305 |pages=1431–8 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/305/24/1431 | pmid=6975437 | issue=24 }}</ref>

Prior to the development of more effective treatments, PCP was a common and rapid cause of death in persons living with AIDS. Much of the incidence of PCP has been reduced by instituting a standard practice of using oral [[co-trimoxazole]] to prevent the disease in people with [[CD4]] counts less than 200/mm³. In populations that do not have access to preventive treatment, PCP continues to be a major cause of death in AIDS.
