A '''pharmaceutical drug''', also referred to as a '''medicine''' or '''medication''', can be loosely defined as any [[chemical substance]] - or product comprising such - intended for use in the [[medical diagnosis]], [[cure]], [[Therapy|treatment]], or [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] of [[disease]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact1.htm US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, SEC. 210., (g)(1)(B).] Accessed 17 August 2008.</ref><ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0027:EN:HTML Directive 2004/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use. Article 1.] Published March 31, 2004. Accessed 17 August 2008.</ref> The word pharmaceutical comes from the Greek word [[Pharmakeia]]. The modern transliteration of [[Pharmakeia]] is [[Pharmacia]].

== Classification ==
Medications can be classified in various ways,<ref>www.epgonline.org database of prescription pharmaceutical products including drug classifications [http://www.epgonline.org/class.cfm]</ref> such as by [[chemical property|chemical properties]], mode or [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]] (ATC system). The [[World Health Organization]] keeps a list of [[essential medicines]].

A sampling of classes of medicine includes:
# [[Antipyretic]]s: reducing [[fever]] (pyrexia/pyresis)
# [[Analgesic]]s: reducing [[pain]] (painkillers)
# [[Antimalarial drug]]s: treating [[malaria]]
# [[Antibiotic]]s: inhibiting [[Microorganism|germ]] growth
# [[Antiseptic]]s: prevention of germ growth near [[burn]]s, [[Cut (wound)|cut]]s and [[wound]]s

== Administration == <!--Drug administration redirects here-->
Administration is the delivery of a pharmaceutical drug to a patient. There are three major categories of drug administration; [[Enteral]] (taking medication orally), [[Parenteral]] (introducing the medication directly to the circulatory system), and Other (which includes introducing medication through intranasal, topical, inhalation, and rectal means).<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Finkel | first1=Richard | last2=Cubeddu | first2=Luigi | last3=Clark | first3=Michelle | year=2009 | title=Lippencott's Illustrated Reviews: Pharmacology 4th Edition | publisher=Lippencott Williams & Wilkins | pages=1–4 | isbn=978-0-7817-7155-9}}</ref>

It can be performed in various [[dosage forms]] such as [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s, [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]]s, or [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]].

There are many variations in the [[routes of administration]], including [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (into the blood through a vein) and [[oral administration]] (through the mouth).

They can be administered all at once as a [[bolus (medicine)|bolus]], at frequent intervals or continuously. Frequencies are often abbreviated from Latin, such as ''every 8 hours'' reading Q8H from ''Quaque VIII Hora''.

== Statistics == <!--Drug statistics redirects here-->
The "gray market" for cancer and other drugs has been started due to a short supply of pharmaceutical drugs. The data from a statistical graph observed shows that the wholesale acquisition price of 7 prescription drugs are better sources. The drug primarily used to treat breast cancer, called [[Paclitaxel]] costs $695 on the gray market where as the wholesaler costs about $52.78.<ref>Riaz AJOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, V. 104 (3), 02/2012, p. 169-169.</ref>

== Legal considerations ==
Depending upon the [[jurisdiction]], medications may be divided into [[over-the-counter drug]]s (OTC) which may be available without special restrictions, and [[prescription only medicine]] (POM), which must be prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner. The precise distinction between OTC and prescription depends on the legal [[jurisdiction]]. A third category, [[behind-the-counter]] medications (BTMs), is implemented in some jurisdictions. BTMs do not require a prescription, but must be kept in the [[dispensary]], not visible to the public, and only be sold by a [[pharmacist]] or [[pharmacy technician]]. Doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for [[off-label use]] - purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency. The [[Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals]] helps guide the referral process between pharmacists and doctors.

The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] of the [[United Nations]] imposes a world law of [[prohibition]] of certain medications. They publish a lengthy list of chemicals and plants whose trade and consumption (where applicable) is forbidden. OTC medications are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed. Many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have a third category of pharmacy medicines which can only be sold in registered pharmacies, by or under the supervision of a [[pharmacist]].

For [[patented medication]]s, countries may have certain [[Compulsory license|mandatory licensing]] programs which compel, in certain situations, a medication's owner to contract with other agents to manufacture the drug. Such programs may deal with the contingency of a lack of medication in the event of a serious epidemic of disease, or may be part of efforts to ensure that disease treating drugs, such as AIDS drugs, are available to countries which cannot afford the drug owner's price.

=== Prescription practice ===
Drugs which are prescription only are regulated as such because they can impose [[adverse effect]]s and should not be used unless necessary. [[Medical guideline]]s and [[clinical trial]]s required for approval are used to help inform doctors' prescription of these drugs, but errors can happen. Reasons to not prescribe drugs such as interactions or side effects are called [[contraindication]]s.

Errors include overprescription and [[polypharmacy]], misprescription, contraindication and lack of detail in dosage and administrations instructions. In 2000 the definition of a prescription error was studied using a [[Delphi method]] conference; the conference was motivated by ambiguity in the what a prescription error and a need to use a uniform definition in studies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dean B, Barber N, Schachter M |title=What is a prescribing error? |journal=Qual Health Care |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=232–7 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11101708 |pmc=1743540 |doi= 10.1136/qhc.9.4.232|url=}}</ref>

== Development ==
{{Main|Drug development}}

Drug development is the process by which a drug is created. Drugs can be extracted from natural products ([[pharmacognosy]]) or synthesized through chemical processes. The drug's [[active ingredient]] will be combined with a "vehicle" such as a [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]], [[cream]], or [[liquid]] which will be administered through a particular [[route of administration]]. [[Child-resistant packaging]] will likely be used in the ultimate package sold to the consumer.

==Blockbuster drug== <!--Blockbuster drug redirects here-->
A blockbuster drug is a drug generating more than $1&nbsp;billion of revenue for its owner each year.<ref>"''"Blockbuster medicine" is defined as being one which achieves annual revenues of over US$ 1&nbsp;billion at global level.''" in European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/preliminary_report.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper)], 28 November 2008, page 17 (pdf, 1.95 MB).</ref>  [[Cimetidine]] was the first drug ever to reach more than $1 billion a year in sales, thus making it the first blockbuster drug.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/111/me_too_drugs/ |title=Pharmaceutical Sales 101: Me-Too Drugs |author=Whitney, Jake |work=[[Guernica Magazine|Guernica]] |date=February 2006 |accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref>

A report from URCH Publishing estimated that about one third of the pharma market by value is accounted for by blockbusters. About 125 products are blockbusters. The top seller currently is [[Lipitor]], a [[cholesterol]]-lowering medication marketed by [[Pfizer]] with [[Annual pharmaceutical drug sales|sales of $12.5&nbsp;billion]].  In 2009 there were a total of seven new blockbuster drugs, with combined sales of $9.8&nbsp;billion.  Beyond this purely arbitrary financial consideration,

::"In the pharmaceutical industry, a blockbuster drug is one that achieves acceptance by prescribing physicians as a therapeutic standard for, most commonly, a highly prevalent chronic (rather than acute) condition. Patients often take the medicines for long periods."<ref>[http://www.ftpress.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1163084 Finkelstein, Temin "Reasonable Rx: Solving the Drug Price Crisis" 11 January 2008]</ref>

The birth control pill [[Enovid]] was the first modern drug taken by those not ill for a highly prevalent chronic condition.  The focus on highly profitable drugs for chronic conditions and resulting de-emphasis of one-time acute treatment drugs has led to occasional shortages of antibiotics or vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine shortage in the United States.

[[Pharmacoenvironmentology]] is a branch of [[pharmacology]] and a form of [[pharmacovigilance]] which deals entry of [[chemicals]] or [[drugs]] into the [[Natural environment|environment]] after elimination from humans and animals post-therapy. It deals specifically with those pharmacological agents that have impact on the environment via elimination through living organisms subsequent to pharmacotherapy, while [[Ecopharmacology]] is concerned with the entry of chemicals or drugs into the environment through any route and at any concentration disturbing the balance of ecology (ecosystem), as a consequence. [[Ecopharmacology]] is a broad term that includes studies of “[[PPCPs]]” irrespective of doses and route of entry into environment.<ref>{{cite book | last= Rahman | first=SZ| authorlink = | coauthors = Khan RA, Gupta V, Misbah Uddin| year = 2008 | month = | title = An Introduction to Environmental Pharmacology | chapter = Chapter 2: Pharmacoenvironmentology – Ahead of Pharmacovigilance | editor = Rahman SZ, Shahid M & Gupta A | others = | edition = {{Sic|?|1|th}} | pages = 35–52| publisher = Ibn Sina Academy | location = Aligarh, India | isbn = 978-81-906070-4-9 | url = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/6/1/20| doi= 10.1186/1476-069X-6-20| last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2= Khan | first2=RA| last3=Gupta| first3=V| last4= Uddin | first4=Misbah| title= Pharmacoenvironmentology–A Component of Pharmacovigilance | journal= Environmental Health | year= 2007 | month=July| volume= 6 | issue=20| pages= 20| pmid= 17650313  | pmc=1947975}}</ref><ref>Ilene Sue Ruhoy, Christian G.

== History ==

===Ancient pharmacology===
Using plants and plant substances to treat all kinds of diseases and medical conditions is believed to date back to [[prehistoric medicine]].

The [[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]], the oldest known medical text of any kind, dates to about 1800 BC and represents the first documented use of any kind of medication.<ref>Griffith, F. Ll. ''The Petrie Papyri: Hieratic Papyri from Kahun and Gurob''</ref><ref>[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/kahunpapyrus.htm The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]</ref> It and other [[medical papyri]] describe [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Ancient Egyptian medical practices]], such as using [[honey]] to treat infections. 

Ancient [[Babylonia#Medicine|Babylonian medicine]] demonstrate the use of [[Prescription drug|prescriptions]] in the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]]. [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|Medicinal cream]]s and [[Pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s were employed as treatments.<ref name=Stol-99>H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 99, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-04-13666-5.</ref>

On the Indian subcontinent, the [[Atharvaveda]], a sacred text of [[Hinduism]] whose core dates from the 2nd millennium BC, although the hymns recorded in it are believed to be older, is the first Indic text dealing with [[medicine]]. It describes plant-based medications to counter diseases.<ref>See Atharvaveda XIX.34.9</ref> The earliest foundations of [[ayurveda]] were built on a synthesis of selected ancient herbal practices, together with a massive addition of theoretical conceptualizations, new [[nosology|nosologies]] and new therapies dating from about 400 BC onwards.<ref>Kenneth G. Zysk, ''Asceticism and Healing in Ancient India: Medicine in the Buddhist Monastery,'' Oxford University Press, rev. ed. (1998) ISBN 0-19-505956-5.</ref> The student of Āyurveda was expected to know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation and application of his medicines: distillation, operative skills, cooking, horticulture, metallurgy, sugar manufacture, pharmacy, analysis and separation of minerals, compounding of metals, and preparation of [[alkalis]].

The [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, attributed to 5th century BC Greece, refers to the existence of "deadly drugs", and [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek physicians]] imported medications from Egypt and elsewhere.<ref>Heinrich Von Staden, ''Herophilus: The Art of Medicine in Early Alexandria'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), pp. 1-26.</ref>

===Medieval pharmacology===
[[Al-Kindi]]'s 9th century AD book, ''[[De Gradibus]]'' and [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna)'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' cover a range of drugs known to [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world]].

[[Medieval medicine]] saw advances in surgery, but few truly effective drugs existed, beyond [[opium]] and [[quinine]]. Folklore cures and potentially poisonous metal-based compounds were popular treatments. [[Theodoric Borgognoni]], (1205–1296), one of the most significant surgeons of the medieval period, responsible for introducing and promoting important surgical advances including basic [[antiseptic]] practice and the use of [[anaesthetic]]s. [[Garcia de Orta]] described some herbal treatments that were used.

===Modern pharmacology===
For most of the 19th century, drugs were not highly effective, leading [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] to famously comment in 1842 that "if all medicines in the world were thrown into the sea, it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes".<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|21}}

During the [[First World War]], [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Henry Drysdale Dakin|Henry Dakin]] developed the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds with an irrigation, Dakin's solution, a germicide which helped prevent gangrene.

In the inter-war period, the first anti-bacterial agents such as the [[sulpha]] antibiotics were developed. The Second World War saw the introduction of widespread and effective antimicrobial therapy with the development and mass production of [[penicillin]] antibiotics, made possible by the pressures of the war and the collaboration of British scientists with the American pharmaceutical industry.

Medicines commonly used by the late 1920s included [[aspirin]], [[codeine]], and [[morphine]] for pain; [[Digoxin|digitalis]], [[nitroglycerin]], and [[quinine]] for heart disorders, and [[insulin]] for diabetes. Other drugs included [[antitoxin]]s, a few biological vaccines, and a few synthetic drugs. In the 1930s antibiotics emerged: first [[sulfa drug]]s, then [[penicillin]] and other antibiotics. Drugs increasingly became "the center of medical practice".<ref name=Reasonable>{{cite book | year = 2008 | title = Reasonable Rx: Solving the drug price crisis | publisher = FT Press | author = Finkelstein S, Temin P }}</ref>{{rp|22}} In the 1950s other drugs emerged including [[corticosteroids]] for [[inflammation]], rauwolfia alkloids as tranqulizers and antihypertensives, [[antihistamine]]s for nasal allergies, [[xanthine]]s for asthma, and typical [[antipsychotic]]s for psychosis.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|23-24}} As of 2008, thousands of approved drugs have been [[drug development|developed]]. Increasingly, [[biotechnology]] is used to discover [[biopharmaceutical]]s.<ref name=Reasonable/> Recently, multi-disciplinary approaches have yielded a wealth of new data on the development of novel antibiotics and antibacterials and on the use of biological agents for antibacterial therapy.<ref name= MillerAAMillerPF>{{cite book | author= Miller, AA; Miller, PF (editor) | year=2011 | title=Emerging Trends in Antibacterial Discovery: Answering the Call to Arms | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-89-9}}</ref>

In the 1950s new psychiatric drugs, notably the antipsychotic [[chlorpromazine]], were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.

Governments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales. In the U.S., the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] led to the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the FDA. The 1951 Humphrey-Durham Amendment required certain drugs to be sold by prescription. In 1962 a subsequent amendment required new drugs to be tested for efficacy and safety in [[clinical trial]]s.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|24-26}}

Until the 1970s, drug prices were not a major concern for doctors and patients. As more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses, however, costs became burdensome, and by the 1970s nearly every U.S. state required or encouraged the substitution of generic drugs for higher-priced brand names. This also led to the 2006 U.S. law, [[Medicare Part D]], which offers Medicare coverage for drugs.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|28-29}}

As of 2008, the United States is the leader in [[medical research]], including pharmaceutical development. U.S. drug prices are among the highest in the world, and drug innovation is correspondingly high.
