'''Anemia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|iː|m|i|ə}}; [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelled]] '''anaemia''' and '''anæmia'''; from {{lang-grc|ἀναιμία}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|anaimia}}'', meaning ''lack of blood'', from ἀν- ''an-'', "not" + αἷμα ''haima'', "blood") is a decrease in number of [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs) or less than the normal quantity of [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.<ref name=medterms>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15491 MedicineNet.com --> Definition of Anemia] Last Editorial Review: 12/9/2000 8:31:00 AM</ref><ref name=merriam>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anemia merriam-webster dictionary --> anemia] Retrieved on May 25, 2009</ref> However, it can include decreased oxygen-binding ability of each hemoglobin molecule due to deformity or lack in numerical development as in some other types of [[hemoglobin deficiency]].  
Because hemoglobin (found inside RBCs) normally carries [[oxygen]] from the lungs to the [[capillaries]], anemia leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (lack of oxygen) in organs. Since all human cells depend on [[oxygen]] for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences.

Anemia is the most common disorder of the blood. The several kinds of anemia are produced by a variety of underlying causes. It can be classified in a variety of ways, based on the morphology of RBCs, underlying etiologic mechanisms, and discernible clinical spectra, to mention a few. The three main classes include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a [[hemorrhage]] or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive blood cell destruction ([[hemolysis]]) or deficient red blood cell production (ineffective [[hematopoiesis]]).

Of the two major approaches to diagnosis, the "kinetic" approach involves evaluating production, destruction and loss,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic734.htm#section~clinical |title=eMedicine – Anemia, Chronic : Article by Fredrick M Abrahamian, DO, FACEP |publisher=Emedicine.com |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref> and the "morphologic" approach groups anemia by red blood cell size. The morphologic approach uses a quickly available and low-cost lab test as its starting point (the [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]]). On the other hand, focusing early on the question of production may allow the clinician to expose cases more rapidly where multiple causes of anemia coexist.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of anemia.png|thumb|240px|Main symptoms that may appear in anemia<ref>[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/anemia/page3_em.htm eMedicineHealth > anemia article] Author: Saimak T. Nabili, MD, MPH. Editor: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD. Last Editorial Review: 12/9/2008. Retrieved on 4 April 2009</ref>]]

Anemia goes undetermined in many people, and symptoms can be minor or vague.  The signs and symptoms can be related to the underlying cause or the anemia itself.

Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of weakness, or fatigue, general [[malaise]], and sometimes poor concentration.  They may also report [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) on exertion.  In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing [[cardiac output]].  The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as [[palpitation]]s, [[angina]] (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent [[claudication]] of the legs, and symptoms of [[heart failure]].

On examination, the signs exhibited may include [[pallor]] (pale skin, mucosal linings,conjunctiva and [[nail beds]]), but this is not a reliable sign.  There may be signs of specific causes of anemia, e.g., [[koilonychia]] (in iron deficiency), [[jaundice]] (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells&nbsp;— in hemolytic anemia), bone deformities (found in thalassemia major) or leg ulcers (seen in [[sickle-cell disease]]).

In severe anemia, there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation: [[tachycardia]] (a fast heart rate), [[bounding pulse]], flow murmurs, and cardiac [[ventricular hypertrophy]] (enlargement).  There may be signs of [[heart failure]].

[[Pica (disorder)|Pica]], the consumption of non-food items such as soil, paper, wax, grass, ice, and hair, may be a symptom of iron deficiency, although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of [[hemoglobin]].

Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced scholastic performance in children of school age. [[Restless legs syndrome]] is more common in those with [[iron-deficiency anemia]].

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Iron deficiency anemia.jpg|thumb|Peripheral blood smear microscopy of a patient with [[iron-deficiency anemia]]]]
Anemia is typically diagnosed on a [[complete blood count]]. Apart from reporting the number of [[red blood cell]]s and the [[hemoglobin]] level, the [[Automated analyser|automatic counters]] also measure the size of the red blood cells by [[flow cytometry]], which is an important tool in distinguishing between the causes of anemia. Examination of a stained [[blood smear]] using a [[microscope]] can also be helpful, and it is sometimes a necessity in regions of the world where automated analysis is less accessible.

In modern counters, four parameters (RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]] and [[Red blood cell distribution width|RDW]]) are measured, allowing others ([[hematocrit]], [[mean corpuscular hemoglobin|MCH]] and [[mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration|MCHC]]) to be calculated, and compared to values adjusted for age and sex. Some counters estimate hematocrit from direct measurements.

Reticulocyte counts, and the "kinetic" approach to anemia, have become more common than in the past in the large medical centers of the United States and some other wealthy nations, in part because some automatic counters now have the capacity to include reticulocyte counts. A [[reticulocyte]] count is a quantitative measure of the [[bone marrow]]'s production of new red blood cells.  The [[reticulocyte production index]] is a calculation of the ratio between the level of anemia and the extent to which the reticulocyte count has risen in response. If the degree of anemia is significant, even a "normal" reticulocyte count actually may reflect an inadequate response.

If an automated count is not available, a reticulocyte count can be done manually following special staining of the blood film. In manual examination, activity of the bone marrow can also be gauged qualitatively by subtle changes in the numbers and the morphology of young RBCs by examination under a microscope. Newly formed RBCs are usually slightly larger than older RBCs and show polychromasia. Even where the source of blood loss is obvious, evaluation of [[erythropoiesis]] can help assess whether the bone marrow will be able to compensate for the loss, and at what rate.

When the cause is not obvious, clinicians use other tests: [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]], [[ferritin]], [[serum iron]], [[transferrin]], [[folate|RBC folate level]], [[vitamin B12|serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], [[hemoglobin electrophoresis]], [[renal function]] tests (e.g. [[serum creatinine]]).

When the diagnosis remains difficult, a [[bone marrow examination]] allows direct examination of the precursors to red cells.

==Classification==
===Red blood cell size===
In the morphological approach, anemia is classified by the size of red blood cells; this is either done automatically or on microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear. The size is reflected in the [[mean corpuscular volume]] (MCV). If the cells are smaller than normal (under 80 [[femtolitre|fl]]), the anemia is said to be microcytic; if they are normal size (80–100 fl), normocytic; and if they are larger than normal (over 100 fl), the anemia is classified as macrocytic. This scheme quickly exposes some of the most common causes of anemia; for instance, a microcytic anemia is often the result of [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]]. In clinical workup, the MCV will be one of the first pieces of information available, so even among clinicians who consider the "kinetic" approach more useful philosophically, morphology will remain an important element of classification and diagnosis.

===Production vs. destruction or loss===
The "kinetic" approach to anemia yields  arguably the most clinically relevant classification of anemia. This classification depends on evaluation of several hematological parameters, particularly the blood [[reticulocyte]] (precursor of mature RBCs) count. This then yields the classification of defects by decreased RBC production versus increased RBC destruction and/or loss. Clinical signs of loss or destruction include abnormal [[peripheral blood smear]] with signs of hemolysis; elevated [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] suggesting cell destruction; or clinical signs of bleeding, such as guaiac-positive stool, radiographic findings, or frank bleeding.

The following is a simplified schematic of this approach:

Other characteristics visible on the peripheral smear may provide valuable clues about a more specific diagnosis; for example, abnormal [[white blood cell]]s may point to a cause in the [[bone marrow]].

====Microcytic====
{{main|Microcytic anemia}}
Microcytic anemia is primarily a result of hemoglobin synthesis failure/insufficiency, which could be caused by several etiologies:
* [[Heme]] synthesis defect
** [[Iron deficiency anemia]]
** [[Anemia of chronic disease]] (more commonly presenting as normocytic anemia)
* [[Globin]] synthesis defect
** Alpha-, and beta-[[thalassemia]]
** HbE syndrome
** HbC syndrome
** Various other unstable hemoglobin diseases
* Sideroblastic defect
** Hereditary sideroblastic anemia
** Acquired sideroblastic anemia, including [[lead poisoning|lead toxicity]]
** Reversible sideroblastic anemia

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia overall and it has many causes. RBCs often appear hypochromic (paler than usual) and microcytic (smaller than usual) when viewed with a microscope.
*Iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient dietary intake or absorption of [[iron]] to meet the body's needs. Infants, toddlers, and pregnant women have higher than average needs. Increased iron intake is also needed to offset blood losses due to digestive tract issues, frequent blood donations, or [[Menorrhagia|heavy menstrual periods]].<ref name=irond>[http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/nutrition/nutrition_for_everyone/iron_deficiency/index.htm Recommendations to Prevent and Control Iron Deficiency in the United States] MMWR 1998;47 (No. RR-3) p. 5</ref>  Iron is an essential part of hemoglobin, and low iron levels result in decreased incorporation of hemoglobin into red blood cells. In the United States, 12% of all women of childbearing age have iron deficiency, compared with only 2% of adult men. The incidence is as high as 20% among African American  and Mexican American women.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Iron Deficiency --- United States, 1999--2000|journal=MMWR|date=October 11, 2002|volume=51|issue=40|pages=897–899|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5140a1.htm|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref> Studies have shown iron deficiency without anemia causes poor school performance and lower [[IQ]] in teenage girls, although this may be due to socioeconomic factors.<ref name=halterman1>{{cite journal| author= Halterman JS, Kaczorowski JM, Aligne CA, Auinger P, Szilagyi PG |title=Iron Deficiency and Cognitive Achievement Among School-Aged Children and Adolescents in the United States |journal=Pediatrics| year=2001|volume=107|issue=6|pages=1381–1386|pmid=11389261|doi=10.1542/peds.107.6.1381}}</ref><ref name=mcgregor1>{{cite journal|author=Grantham-McGregor S, Ani C | title=Iron-Deficiency Anemia: Reexamining the Nature and Magnitude of the Public Health Problem|journal=J Nutr | year=2001 |volume=131|issue=2|pages=649S–668S|pmid=11160596|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/2/649S.full}}</ref>  Iron deficiency is the most prevalent deficiency state on a worldwide basis.  It is sometimes the cause of abnormal fissuring of the angular (corner) sections of the  lips ([[angular stomatitis]]).
*In the United States, the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding or blood loss, usually from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. [[Fecal occult blood|Fecal occult blood testing]], [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|upper endoscopy]] and [[colonoscopy|lower endoscopy]] should be performed to identify bleeding lesions. In older men and women, the chances are higher that bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract could be due to [[Polyp (medicine)|colon polyp]]s or [[colorectal cancer]].
* Worldwide, the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia is parasitic infestation ([[hookworm]]s, [[amebiasis]], [[schistosomiasis]] and [[Trichuris trichiura|whipworm]]s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/en/ida_assessment_prevention_control.pdf |title=Iron Deficiency Anaemia: Assessment, Prevention, and Control: A guide for programme managers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>

====Macrocytic====
{{main|Macrocytic anemia}}
*[[Megaloblastic anemia]], the most common cause of macrocytic anemia, is due to a deficiency of either [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], [[folic acid]], or both. Deficiency in folate and/or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be due either to inadequate intake or [[malabsorption|insufficient absorption]]. Folate deficiency normally does not produce neurological symptoms, while B<sub>12</sub> deficiency does.
** [[Pernicious anemia]] is caused by a lack of [[intrinsic factor]], which is required to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from food. A lack of intrinsic factor may arise from an [[autoimmune]] condition targeting the [[parietal cell]]s (atrophic gastritis) that produce intrinsic factor or against intrinsic factor itself. These lead to poor absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.
**Macrocytic anemia can also be caused by removal of the functional portion of the stomach, such as during [[gastric bypass]] surgery, leading to reduced vitamin B<sub>12</sub>/folate absorption. Therefore, one must always be aware of anemia following this procedure.
* [[Hypothyroidism]]
* [[Alcoholism]] commonly causes a [[macrocytosis]], although not specifically anemia. Other types of [[liver disease]] can also cause macrocytosis.
* [[Methotrexate]], [[zidovudine]], and other drugs may inhibit [[DNA replication]].

Macrocytic anemia can be further divided into "megaloblastic anemia" or "nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia". The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells. The megaloblastic anemias often  present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes). The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e. unimpaired DNA globin synthesis,) which occur, for example, in alcoholism.

In addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency include [[peripheral neuropathy]] and [[subacute combined degeneration of the cord]] with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/NEURO/topic439.htm eMedicine – Vitamin B-12 Associated Neurological Diseases : Article by Niranjan N Singh, MD, DM, DNB] July 18, 2006</ref> Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and [[glossitis]].

The treatment for vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-deficient anemia was first devised by [[William Murphy (scientist)|William Murphy]], who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease. [[George Richards Minot|George Minot]] and [[George Whipple]] then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] from the liver. All three shared the 1934 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1934/press.html |title=Physiology or Medicine 1934 – Presentation Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1934-12-10 |accessdate=2010-08-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100828134134/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1934/press.html| archivedate= 28 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

====Normocytic====
{{main|Normocytic anemia}}
Normocytic anemia occurs when the overall hemoglobin levels are decreased, but the red blood cell size ([[mean corpuscular volume]]) remains normal. Causes include:
* Acute [[hemorrhage|blood loss]]
* [[Anemia of chronic disease]]
* [[Aplastic anemia]] (bone marrow failure)
* [[Hemolytic anemia]]

====Dimorphic====
A dimorphic appearance on a peripheral blood smear occurs when there are two simultaneous populations of red blood cells, typically of different size and hemoglobin content (this last feature affecting the color of the red blood cell on a stained peripheral blood smear). For example, a person recently transfused for iron deficiency would have small, pale, iron deficient red blood cells (RBCs) and the donor RBCs of normal size and color. Similarly, a person transfused for severe folate or vitamin B12 deficiency would have two cell populations, but, in this case, the patient's RBCs would be larger and paler than the donor's RBCs. A person with sideroblastic anemia (a defect in heme synthesis, commonly caused by alcoholism, but also drugs/toxins, nutritional deficiencies, a few acquired and rare congenital diseases) can have a dimorphic smear from the sideroblastic anemia alone. Evidence for multiple causes appears with an elevated RBC distribution width (RDW), indicating a wider-than-normal range of red cell sizes, also seen in common nutritional anemia.

====Heinz body anemia====
[[Heinz body|Heinz bodies]] form in the cytoplasm of RBCs and appear as small dark dots under the microscope. Heinz body anemia has many causes, and some forms can be drug-induced.  It is triggered in [[cat]]s by eating [[onion]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=0&cat=1763&articleid=1108 |title=Onions are Toxic to Cats |publisher=Peteducation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100903022041/http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=0&cat=1763&articleid=1108| archivedate= 3 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> or [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol). It can be triggered in [[dogs]] by ingesting onions or [[zinc]], and in horses by ingesting dry [[Acer rubrum|red maple]] leaves.

===Hyperanemia===
'''Hyperanemia''' is a severe form of anemia, in which the [[hematocrit]] is below 10%.

===Refractory anemia===
Refractory anemia, an anemia which does not respond to [[Therapy|treatment]],<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5275 |title=MedTerms Definition: Refractory Anemia |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> is often seen secondary to [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Anomalies/RAID1104.html |title=Good Source for later |publisher=Atlasgeneticsoncology.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>

==Causes==
Broadly, causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell (RBC) production, increased RBC destruction ([[hemolytic anemia]]s), blood loss and fluid overload ([[hypervolemia]]). Several of these may interplay to cause anemia eventually. Indeed, the most common cause of anemia is blood loss, but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired RBC production develops, in turn most commonly by [[iron deficiency]].<ref>[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/anemia/anemia_causes.html National Heart Lung and Blood Institute > What Causes Anemia?] Retrieved on June 9, 2010</ref> (See [[Iron deficiency anemia]])

===Blood loss===
* [[Anemia of prematurity]] from frequent blood sampling for laboratory testing, combined with insufficient RBC production
*[[Physical trauma|Trauma]]<ref name=Robbins12-1/> or [[surgery]], causing acute blood loss
*Gastrointestinal tract lesions,<ref name=Robbins12-1/> causing a rather chronic blood loss
*Gynecologic disturbances,<ref name=Robbins12-1/> also generally causing chronic blood loss
*From [[menstruation]], mostly among young women

===Fluid overload===
Fluid overload ([[hypervolemia]]) causes decreased hemoglobin concentration and apparent anemia:
* General causes of [[hypervolemia]] include excessive sodium or fluid intake, sodium or water retention and fluid shift into the intravascular space.<ref name=Hagerstwon>Page 62 (Fluid imbalances) in: {{cite book |author= |title=Portable Fluids and Electrolytes (Portable Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-58255-678-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
* Anemia of pregnancy  is induced by blood volume expansion experienced in [[pregnancy]].

==Treatments==
Treatments for anemia depend on severity and cause.

===Oral iron===
Iron deficiency from nutritional causes is rare in men and postmenopausal women. The diagnosis of iron deficiency mandates a search for potential sources of loss, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulfate]], [[ferrous fumarate]], or [[ferrous gluconate]].  When taking iron supplements, stomach upset and/or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced.  The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed.  [[Vitamin C]] aids in the body's ability to absorb iron, so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit.

In anemias of chronic disease, associated with chemotherapy, or associated with renal disease, some clinicians prescribe [[recombinant protein|recombinant]] [[erythropoietin]] or [[epoetin alfa]], to stimulate RBC production.

===Parenteral iron===
In cases where oral iron has either proven ineffective, would be too slow (for example, pre-operatively) or where absorption is impeded (for example in cases of inflammation), [[parenteral iron]] can be used. The body can absorb up to 6&nbsp;mg iron daily from the gastrointestinal tract. In many cases the patient has a deficit of over 1,000&nbsp;mg of iron which would require several months to replace. This can be given concurrently with [[erythropoietin]] to ensure sufficient iron for increased rates of [[erythropoiesis]].

===Blood transfusions===
Doctors attempt to avoid [[blood transfusion]] in general, since multiple lines of evidence point to increased adverse patient clinical outcomes with more intensive transfusion strategies.  The physiological principle that reduction of oxygen delivery associated with anemia leads to adverse clinical outcomes is balanced by the finding that transfusion does not necessarily mitigate these adverse clinical outcomes. Blood does have risks associated, such as disease transmission and host incompatibility, even in cases where crossmatching was correctly undertaken. Each unit of blood is only equivalent to 200–250&nbsp;mg iron, thus requiring several units per patient to replete iron stores. Increasingly, physicians are using [[parenteral iron]] both to conserve a finite resource, for improved patient outcomes but also to reduce costs to the hospital.

Transfusion of the stable but anemic hospitalized patient has been the subject of numerous [[clinical trials]].

Four randomized, controlled clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate aggressive versus conservative transfusion strategies in critically ill patients.  All four of these studies failed to find a benefit with more aggressive transfusion strategies.<ref name="pmid9971864">{{cite journal |author=Hébert PC |title=A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of transfusion requirements in critical care.

HBO may be used for medical reasons when threat of [[blood product]] incompatibility or concern for [[Transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]] are factors.<ref name=uhms/> The beliefs of some religions (ex: [[Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions|Jehovah's Witnesses]]) may require they use the HBO method.<ref name=uhms/>

In 2002, Van Meter reviewed the [[Medical journal|publications]] surrounding the use of HBO in severe anemia and found all publications reported positive results.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Meter KW |title=A systematic review of the application of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of severe anemia: an evidence-based approach |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=61–83 |year=2005 |pmid=15796315 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4038 |accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref>

Vitamin supplements given orally ([[folic acid]] or vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) or intramuscularly ([[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]]) will replace specific deficiencies.

===Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent===
The motive for the administration of an [[erythropoiesis-stimulating agent]] (ESA) is to maintain hemoglobin at the lowest level that both minimizes transfusions and best meets individual patient needs.<ref name="2007anemiaESA">{{cite doi|10.1634/theoncologist.13-S3-33}}</ref> Medical [[Specialty (medicine)|speciality]] [[professional organizations]] do not recommend the use of ESAs to [[chronic kidney disease]] patients who do not have hemoglobin levels greater than 10 g/dL and do not have [[anemia]] symptoms.<ref name="2007anemiaESA"/><ref name="ASNfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Nephrology |author1-link = American Society of Nephrology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Nephrology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph.pdf |accessdate = August 17 2012}}</ref>
