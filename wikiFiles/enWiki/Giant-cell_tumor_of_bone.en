'''Giant-cell tumor of the bone''' (GCTOB) is a relatively uncommon [[tumor]] of the bone.  It is characterized by the presence of [[multinucleated giant cells]] ([[osteoclast]]-like cells). Malignancy in giant cell tumor is not common. However, if malignant degeneration does occur it is likely to metastasize to the lungs. Giant cell tumors are normally [[benign]],<ref name="pmid16162299">{{cite journal |author=Pai SB, Lalitha RM, Prasad K, Rao SG, Harish K |title=Giant cell tumor of the temporal bone&mdash;a case report |journal=BMC Ear Nose Throat Disord |volume=5 |issue= |pages=8 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16162299 |doi=10.1186/1472-6815-5-8 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6815/5/8 |pmc=1253509}}</ref> with unpredictable behavior.<ref name="Werner, M. 2006">Werner, M.

==Epidemiology==
Giant-cell tumor of the bone accounts for 4-5% of primary bone tumors and ~20% of benign bone tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gamberi G, Serra M, Ragazzini P, Magagnoli G, Pazzaglia L, Ponticelli F, Ferrari C, Zanasi M, Bertoni F, Picci P, Benassi M |title=Identification of markers of possible prognostic value in 57 giant-cell tumors of bone |journal=Oncol Rep |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=351–6 |year= 2003 |pmid=12579271}}</ref>  However, significantly higher incidence rates are observed in Asia, where it constitutes about 20% of all primary bone tumors in China.<ref>Thomas, D.

==Clinical presentation==
[[image:3dee10fb0a8ad6244470738a8cb382 big gallery.jpg|thumb|Distribution of giant cell tumours (GCT) of bone]]
Patients usually present with pain and limited range of motion caused by tumor's proximity to the joint space. There may be swelling as well, if the tumor has been growing for a long time. Some patients may be asymptomatic until they develop a [[pathologic fracture]] at the site of the tumor.
The symptoms may include muscular aches and pains in arms, legs and abdominal pain. 
Patients may also experience nerve pain which feels like an electric shock.

===Imaging===
[[Image:Giant cell tumor of bone08.JPG|thumb|right|X-ray of a giant-cell bone tumor in the head of the fourth metacarpal of the left hand.]]
On x-ray, giant-cell tumors (GCTs) are lytic/lucent lesions that have a epiphyseal location and grow to the articular surface of the involved bone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphey M, Nomikos G, Flemming D, Gannon F, Temple H, Kransdorf M |title=From the archives of AFIP.

MRI can be used to assess intramedullary and soft tissue extension.

===Diagnosis===
[[Image:Giant cell tumour of bone - very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|High magnification [[micrograph]] of giant cells in a giant-cell tumor of bone. H&E stain.]]
The [[diagnosis]] of giant cell tumors is based on [[biopsy]] findings.  The key histomorphologic feature is, as the name of the entity suggests, (multinucleated) giant cells with up to a hundred nuclei that have prominent nucleoli.  Surrounding mononuclear and small multinucleated cells have nuclei similar to those in the giant cells; this distinguishes the lesion from other osteogenic lesions which commonly have (benign) [[osteoclast]]-type giant cells.

==Treatment==
General treatment regimens have not changed much in the past 30 years, in part due to the lack of randomized clinical trials <ref name="Thomas, D. M. 2009"/>  Surgery is the treatment of choice if the tumor is determined to be resectable. [[Curettage]] is a commonly used technique.<ref name="pmid18322700">{{cite journal |author=Balke M, Schremper L, Gebert C, ''et al.'' |title=Giant cell tumor of bone: treatment and outcome of 214 cases |journal=J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. |volume= 134|issue= 9|pages= 969|year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18322700 |doi=10.1007/s00432-008-0370-x}}</ref>  The situation is complicated in a patient with a pathological fracture. It may be best to immobilize the affected limb and wait for the fracture to heal before performing surgery.  

Patients with tumors that are not amenable to surgery are treated with radiation therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mendenhall W, Zlotecki R, Scarborough M, Gibbs C, Mendenhall N |title=Giant cell tumor of bone |journal=Am J Clin Oncol |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=96–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16462511 |doi=10.1097/01.coc.0000195089.11620.b7}}</ref> However caution is employed since a majority of recurrent tumors with transformations to the malignant sarcoma phenotype have been in patients receiving radiotherapy for their primary benign lesion.<ref>Mendenhall, W. M., Zlotecki, R. A., Scarborough, M. T., Gibbs, P. C., & Mendenhall, N. P. (2006). Giant Cell Tumor of Bone. American Journal of Clinical Oncology , 29 (1), 96-99</ref>  Pharmacotherapy for GCTOB, includes [[bisphosphonates]] such as [[Zoledronate]], which are thought to induce [[apoptosis]] in the MNGC fraction, preventing tumor-induced osteolysis.  Indeed in-vitro studies have shown Zolidronate to be effective in killing osteoclast-like cells.<ref name="Werner, M. 2006"/><ref name="Thomas, D. M. 2009"/>  More recently, humanized [[monoclonal antibodies]] such as [[Denosumab]] targeting the [[RANK ligand]] (RANKL) have been employed in treatment of GCTOB in a phase II study.  This is based on the notion that increased expression of RANK-ligands by stromal cells plays a role in tumor pathogenesis.<ref name="Thomas, D. M. 2009"/>

==Other bone tumors with giant cells==
A number of tumors have giant cells, but are not true benign giant-cell tumors. These include, [[aneurysmal bone cyst]], [[chondroblastoma]], simple [[bone cyst]], [[osteoid osteoma]], [[osteoblastoma]], [[osteosarcoma]], [[giant-cell reparative granuloma]], and [[brown tumor]] of hyperparathyroidism.
