'''Batrachotoxins''' ('''BTX''') are extremely potent [[cardiotoxic]] and [[neurotoxic]] [[steroids|steroidal]] [[alkaloids]] found in certain species of frogs ([[poison dart frog]]), [[Melyridae|melyrid]] beetles, and birds (''[[Pitohui]]'', ''[[Ifrita kowaldi]]'', ''[[Colluricincla megarhyncha]]''). It is the most potent non-peptidal neurotoxin known.<ref name="Molecular Pharmacology">{{cite web |url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/69/3/788.long |title=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/ |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>




==Chemistry==
Batrachotoxin comes from the Greek words "batrachos" (βάτραχος) meaning frog, and "toxine" (τοξίνη) meaning poison. It was named by scientists John Daly and Bernhard Witkop, who separated the potent toxic alkaloids fraction and determined chemical properties. Due to the difficulty of handling such a potent toxin and the minuscule amount that could be collected, a comprehensive structure determination involved several sufferings. However, Takashi Tokuyama, who joined to the investigation later, converted one of congener compounds, Batrachotoxinin A, to a crystalline derivative and its unique steroidal structure was solved with x-ray diffraction techniques (1968).<ref>{{cite journal|ACS|author=Tokuyama, T.; Daly, J.; Witkop, B.; Karle, I. L.; Karle, J.|title=The structure of batrachotoxinin A, a novel steroidal alkaloid from the Columbian arrow poison frog, ''Phyllobates aurotaenia''|journal=[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]|year=1968|volume=90|pages=1917–1918|doi=10.1021/ja01009a052}}</ref> When the mass spectrum and NMR spectrum of batrachotoxin and the batrachotoxinin A derivatives were compared, it was realized that the two shared the same steroidal structure and that batrachotoxin was batrachotoxinin A with a single extra pyrrole moiety attached. The structure of batrachotoxin was established in 1969 through chemical recombination of both fragments.<ref>{{cite journal|ACS|author=Tokuyama, T.; Daly, J.; Witkop.

More than 100 toxins have been identified from the skin secretions of members of the frog family [[Dendrobatidae]], especially ''[[Dendrobates]]'' and ''[[Phyllobates]]''. Members of the genus ''Dendrobates'', ''[[Ranitomeya]]'', and ''[[Oophaga]]'' are also known as "poison dart" or "poison arrow" frogs. However, only frogs of the genus ''Phyllobates'' produce the highly lethal batrachotoxin. One example of this would be the ''[[Phyllobates terribilis]]'', also known as the Golden Poison frog. This frog is considered by some to be one of the most poisonous animals in the world. The poison seeps through pores, hair follicles, and abrasions.

==Toxicity==
Extrapolating from the {{LD50}} in rats, the lethal dose of this alkaloid in humans is estimated to be 1 to 2&nbsp;µg/kg. Thus, the lethal dose for a 68&nbsp;kg (150 pound) person would be approximately 100 micrograms, or equivalent to the weight of two grains of ordinary (fine) [[table salt]] (NaCl). Batrachotoxin is thus around fifteen times more potent than [[curare]] (another arrow poison used by South American Indians and derived from plants of the genera ''[[Strychnos]]'' and ''[[Curarea]]''), and about ten times more potent than [[tetrodotoxin]], from the [[puffer fish]].

The toxin is released through colourless or milky secretions from glands located on the back and behind the ears of frogs from the genus ''Phyllobates''. When one of these frogs is agitated, feels threatened or is in pain, the toxin is reflexively released through several canals.

As a [[neurotoxin]] it affects the [[nervous system]]. Neurological function depends on  [[depolarization]] of nerve and muscle fibres due to increased sodium ion permeability of the excitable cell membrane. Lipid-soluble toxins such as batrachotoxin act directly on [[sodium ion channel]]s<ref name="pmid16354762">{{cite journal |author=Wang SY, Mitchell J, Tikhonov DB, Zhorov BS, Wang GK |title=How batrachotoxin modifies the sodium channel permeation pathway: computer modeling and site-directed mutagenesis |journal=Mol. Pharmacol. |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=788–95 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16354762 |doi=10.1124/mol.105.018200 |url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16354762}}</ref> involved in [[action potential]] generation and by modifying both their ion selectivity and voltage sensitivity.

This has a direct effect on the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS). Batrachotoxin in the PNS produces increased [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] (selective and irreversible) of the resting cell membrane to sodium ions, without changing [[potassium]] or [[calcium]] concentration. This influx of sodium depolarizes the formerly polarized cell membrane. Batrachotoxin also alters the ion selectivity of the ion channel by increasing the permeability of the channel toward larger cations. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels become persistently active at the resting membrane potential. Batrachotoxin kills by permanently blocking nerve signal transmission to the muscles.

In laymans terms, batrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the sodium channels of nerve cells such they cannot reset. The neuron is no longer capable of 'firing' (sending messages) and this results in paralysis.

Although generally classified as a [[neurotoxin]], batrachotoxin has marked effects on [[heart muscle]]s. These effects are similar to the [[cardiotoxic]] effects of [[digoxin|digitalis (digoxin)]], a poison found in the [[foxglove]] plant. Batrachotoxin interferes with heart conduction, causing [[arrhythmia]]s, [[extrasystole]]s, [[ventricular fibrillation]] and other changes which lead to [[cardiac arrest]]. Batrachotoxin induces a massive release of [[acetylcholine]] in nerves and muscles and destruction of [[synaptic vesicle]]s, as well. Batrachotoxin R is more toxic than related batrachotoxinin A.

Structural changes in nerves and muscles are due to a massive influx of sodium ions, which produces [[osmotic]] alterations. It has been suggested that there may also be an effect on the [[central nervous system]], although it is not currently known what such an effect may be.

Batrachotoxin activity is temperature-dependent, with a maximum activity at {{convert|37|C|F}}. Its activity is also more rapid at an [[alkaline]] pH, which suggests that the unprotonated form may be more active.

==Treatment==
Currently no effective [[antidote]] exists for the treatment of batrachotoxin poisoning. [[Veratridine]], [[aconitine]] and [[grayanotoxin]]—like batrachotoxin—are lipid-soluble poisons which similarly alter the ion selectivity of the sodium channels, suggesting a common site of action. Due to these similarities, treatment for batrachotoxin poisoning might best be modeled after, or based on, treatments for one of these poisons. Treatment may also be modeled after that for [[digitalis]], which produces somewhat similar cardiotoxic effects.

While it is not an antidote, the membrane depolarization can be prevented or reversed by either [[tetrodotoxin]] (from [[puffer fish]]), which is a [[noncompetitive inhibitor]], or [[saxitoxin]] ("[[red tide]]"). These both have effects antagonistic to those of batrachotoxin on sodium flux. Certain [[anesthetic]]s may act as [[receptor antagonist]]s to the action of this alkaloid poison, while other local anesthetics block its action altogether by acting as competitive antagonists.

==Source==
The "poison dart" (or "poison arrow") frog does not produce batrachotoxin itself. It is believed that the frogs get the poison from eating beetles or other insects in their native habitat. Frogs raised in captivity do not produce batrachotoxin, and thus may be handled without the risk of death.

The native habitat of poison dart frogs is the warm regions of [[Central America]] and [[South America]], in which the humidity is around 80 percent.

Of the three so-called "poison dart" frogs which contain batrachotoxin—''[[Phyllobates terribilis]]'', ''[[Phyllobates aurotaenia]]'', and ''[[Phyllobates bicolor]]''—the most toxic is the most recently discovered ''Phyllobates terribilis'', which generally contains 27 times more batrachotoxin than its close relatives and is 20-fold more toxic.

Also in 1990, it was discovered that some bird species in [[New Guinea]], such as the [[Hooded Pitohui]], contain the toxin on their skin and feathers. Like the dart frogs, it is believed they ingest the toxin from a food source and then secrete it. Specifically, the toxin has been recently discovered in [[Melyridae|melyrid beetles]] from New Guinea (the genus ''[[Choresine]]''),<ref name="pmid15520388">{{cite journal |author=Dumbacher JP, Wako A, Derrickson SR, Samuelson A, Spande TF, Daly JW |title=Melyrid beetles (Choresine): a putative source for the batrachotoxin alkaloids found in poison-dart frogs and toxic passerine birds |journal=Proc.

==Use==
{{see also|Arrow poison|Blowdart}}
The most common use of this toxin is by the Noanamá Chocó and Emberá Chocó Indians of western [[Colombia]] for poisoning [[blowgun]] darts for use in hunting.

Poison darts are prepared by the Chocó Amerindians by first impaling a frog on a piece of wood.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} By some accounts, the frog is then held over or roasted alive over a fire until it cries in pain. Bubbles of poison form as the frog's skin begins to blister. The dart tips are prepared by touching them to the toxin, or the toxin can be caught in a container and allowed to ferment. Poison darts made from either fresh or fermented batrachotoxin are enough to drop monkeys and birds in their tracks. Nerve paralysis is almost instantaneous.

Other accounts say that a stick siurukida ("bamboo tooth") is put through the mouth of the frog and passed out through one of its hind legs. This causes the frog to [[perspire]] profusely on its back, which becomes covered with a white froth. The darts are dipped or rolled in the froth, preserving their lethal power for up to a year.
