'''''The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[healthcare journal|medical journal]] which focuses on [[clinical psychology|clinical psychiatry]], especially [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[anxiety]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], as well as several other [[mental disorder]]s. It is the official journal of the [[American Society for Clinical Psychopharmacology]], continuing in series the earlier title ''Diseases of the Nervous System'' which was published 1940-1978.

According to a [[Nielsen Company|PERQ/HCI]] Focus Readership Study, the journal ranks highest in "total number of office- and hospital-based average issue readers of psychiatric journals." The journal's promotional material claims that "more psychiatrists report receiving JCP than any other psychiatry journal."<ref>http://www.psychiatrist.com/advertisers/2010_JCP_RateSheet_p1.pdf</ref> Most subscribers receive the journal free of charge if they are designated as psychiatric clinicians in provider databases such as the [[American Medical Association]]'s masterfile.<ref name=plosone>{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0009876}}</ref>

The journal publishes a number of sponsored supplements, which require registration to access on-line, but are otherwise free of charge, unlike the main journal. Although these supplements may be perceived as more biased by commercial interests, and are subjected to a different [[peer review]] process than articles in the journal proper, they nevertheless have a comparable number of citations.<ref name=plosone/>
