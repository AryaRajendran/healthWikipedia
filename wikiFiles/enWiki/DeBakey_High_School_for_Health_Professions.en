''' Michael E. DeBakey High School for Health Professions''' is a medical [[secondary school]] located in the [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]] area of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]],  [[Texas]], [[United States]].<ref>Falkenberg, Lisa. (commentary) "[http://www.chron.com/news/falkenberg/article/Let-s-thank-DeBakey-for-school-too-1770316.php Let's thank DeBakey for school, too]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Tuesday July 15, 2008. Retrieved on November 20, 2011.</ref>

It has been named the number one public high school in Houston by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Houston Press]]'', and [[Children at Risk]] and number 36 best high school in the US by ''[[US News]]'' in 2012. DeBakey High School, which serves grades 9 through 12, is a part of the [[Houston Independent School District]] and is east of the [[Texas Medical Center]]. It is the only HISD [[magnet school|magnet high school]] for health professions. The school was named after [[Michael E. DeBakey]], a famous heart surgeon. DeBakey does not automatically take in students from the surrounding neighborhood; the surrounding neighborhood is zoned to [[Yates High School]].<ref>"[http://dept.houstonisd.org/ab/schoolboundarymaps/YatesHS.pdf Yates High School Attendance Zone]." ''[[Houston Independent School District]]''.</ref> Nearly 1000 students take entrance exams for 200-300 spots, which cover statistical data and procedures.

==History==
With an initial student body of 45, the High School for Health Professions opened in 1972 as part of a partnership between HISD and the [[Baylor College of Medicine]].<ref name="DeBakeyQatar">"[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5804771.html DeBakey principal taking school's premise abroad]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. May 28, 2008.</ref> Perry Weston was the first principal.

In the 1984-1985 school year, of the HISD campuses, DeBakey had the lowest percentage of failing grades. In the fall semester, 7% of grades were failing, while in the spring semester, 6% of grades were failing.<ref>Hunt, Dianna. "[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1985_18719/fewer-failing-grades-since-start-of-no-pass-rule.html Fewer failing grades since start of no-pass rule]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Saturday June 29, 1985. Section 1, Page 22. Retrieved on December 8, 2011.</ref>

The school was renamed after Michael E. DeBakey in 1996.<ref name="DeBakeyQatar"/>

The school was a [[National Blue Ribbon School]] award winner in 1997-98<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982-1983 Through 1999-2002 (PDF)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and 2003.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-2003.pdf Microsoft Word - list-2003.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Plans for the school to be relocated within the [[Texas Medical Center]] were made but soon canceled because the [[Houston Independent School District]] decided to renovate instead. Renovations started August 2006 and ended in 2008.[http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDPortal/departments/ContentPage/0,3099,45555309_53732651_64873191,00.html]

In 2006 the HISD board considered moving the [[Kay On-Going Education Center]], a special school for pregnant girls, to an unused area within [[DeBakey High School]]. DeBakey had around 30 unused classrooms, and HISD administrators argued that the [[Texas Medical Center]] location would be of use to pregnant students.<ref>Radcliffe, Jennifer. "[http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/HISD-offers-plan-to-save-school-for-pregnant-teens-1507107.php HISD offers plan to save school for pregnant teens]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Tuesday May 9, 2006. Retrieved on December 8, 2011.</ref> Jennifer Radcliffe of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said that the proposed plan yielded a "mixed" reaction in DeBakey parents and students.<ref name="Nomerge"/> Some signed a petition asking the district not to merge Kay On-Going into DeBakey.<ref name="Nomerge">Radcliffe, Jennifer. "[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2006_4140906/communities-amp-neighborhoods-school-won-t-relocat.html]

Saturday June 24, 2006. B2. Retrieved on December 8, 2011.</ref> Ultimately HISD did not go forward with the plan. Instead it moved into Kay On-Going into the [[Carter Career Center]] in the [[Fifth Ward, Houston|Fifth Ward]].<ref name="Nomerge"/>

The Supreme Education Council of [[Qatar]] opened a branch version of DeBakey, [[DeBakey High School for Health Professions at Qatar]], in its country, with Charlesetta Deason, formerly principal of the Houston school, as the head of the Qatar school.<ref name="DeBakeyQatar"/>

In 2012, four DeBakey juniors qualified for the [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]], and two--Thomas Kuncewicz and Andy Tran--placed second place in their respective categories detailing chitosan nanoparticles.

==Academics==
DeBakey offers pre-advanced placement(PAP) classes in foreign languages, mathematics, science, social sciences, and English in 9th and 10th grade (though physics can be taken PAP in 11th grade), as well as 16 [[Advanced Placement]] classes: AP English Literature, AP English Language, AP Spanish Language, AP French, AP World History, AP US History, AP Computer Science, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Macroeconomics, AP US Government and Politics, AP Physics B, AP Statistics, AP Chemistry, AP Biology, and AP Psychology. 

The school requires students to fulfill these class requirements to graduate as DeBakey scholars:
*5 years of mathematics (culminating in AP Calculus)
*5 years of science (culminating in an AP-level course)
*4 years of health sciences
*4 years of social studies
*4 years of English
*3 years of a foreign language (same language for all 3 years)
*1 year of a computer course, Business Information Management or AP Computer Science
*1 year of fine arts or theater arts
*1.5 years of physical education
*1 semester of communication applications
*1 semester of study skills
*1 semester of SAT preparation

DeBakey has been widely recognized for its performance in academics, particularly in math and science. The students score an average of a 3.7/5 on their AP examinations, which is higher than the typical average of 3.03. In 2011, DeBakey was ranked number 11 best school for math and science by the USNews Rankings, and it has been recognized each year for black student performance on the AP Calculus AB examination by the [[College Board]].

==Health science==
Each year, students are required to take an Health Science Technology (HST) class, which serve as the principle magnet program for the school. The course selection includes:
*9th grade- A full year course on Medical terminology and ethics
*10th grade- A full year course on anatomy
*11th grade- 2 month programs rotating around dentistry, clinical rotations, and medical laboratory, through which students gain hands-on experience with activities such as performing reflex tests, making mouth molds through plaster, and performing urine and blood specimen exams. This class is 2 periods long.
*12th grade- 2 month program rotating around biomedical-engineering and world health, physiology, and preceptorship. The preceptorship program revolves around 3 sets of 6 day shadowing opportunities around the Texas Medical Center, with programs such as research at Rice University, neurology at the Veteran's Affair Hospital, nutritional research at the Children's Hospital, and a look into the Houston Veterinarian Society. This class is 2 periods long. 

Students ultimately interact and are able to learn first-hand from physicians and surgeons who work at various institutions of the Texas Medical Center. They frequently witness live surgeries there and attend seminars, making the learning experience quite unlike courses offered at other public schools in HISD.[http://hs.houstonisd.org/debakeyhs/Curriculum.html]

==School uniforms==
Students in the school are required to wear [[school uniforms]].<ref>"[http://hs.houstonisd.org/DeBakeyhs/dress_code.html Standard Dress Code]." ''DeBakey High School for Health Professions''. Retrieved on January 17, 2009.</ref> In 2010, the school announced that its new uniform code will require students to buy shirts from the parent teacher organization. The shirts must have a DeBakey logo. This led to protests from students and parents who were unwilling to spend additional money on school-mandated clothes; DeBakey's student body as of that year was 55% free lunch or reduced lunch.<ref>Downing, Margaret. "[http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2010/07/debakey_pta_takes_over_uniform.php DeBakey PTA Takes Over Uniform Sales; Students Cry Excuse Me But Foul!]" ''[[Houston Press]]''. Monday July 12, 2010. Retrieved on July 23, 2010.</ref>

==Student body==
As of 2010-2011 school year, the school was made up of 58% female and 42% male students. Of these, 23% were [[African American]], 37% were [[Asian people|Asian]], 30% were [[Hispanic]], <1% were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and 8% were [[White people|White]]. 100% of DeBakey students passed the [[Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills]] (TAKS), and 100% of the class completed their four years at the school. Nearly half of the class was on free or reduced lunch. [http://dept.houstonisd.org/profiles/DeBakey_HS.pdf]

The school offers more than twenty-five clubs. Clubs include [[Health Occupation Students of America]], BSU (Black Student Union), VISA (Vietnamese International Student Association), OLA (organization for Latin Americans), DeBakey Music Club, the Filipino American club (Fil-Am), honor societies including chapters of the BETA club, the National Honor Society, and the [[Spanish National Honor Society]].<ref>"[http://hs.houstonisd.org/DeBakeyHS/clubs.html Clubs]." ''DeBakey High School for Health Professions''.</ref>

==Academic performance and funding==
Typically students score higher than average schools on the [[SAT]] and the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], scoring an average composite 1829 and 27.1 respectively, and perform exceptionally well on state tests. Almost all students attending DeBakey graduate from high school. As of 2011 DeBakey's per-pupil spending was $8,807 per student, $1,450 over the [[Greater Houston]] average, $7,355.<ref>Mellon, Ericka. "[http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Big-spending-may-not-spell-school-success-in-1689996.php Big spending may not spell school success in Houston]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Monday April 18, 2011. Retrieved on December 30, 2011.</ref>

==Transportation==
Houston ISD provides bus transportation to students who live more than two miles from DeBakey or students with major transportation obstacles. Many students choose to ride the bus, as many live more than eight to twenty miles away from the campus. The average time to reach the school by riding a [[school bus]] is one hour even for students who live relatively close to the school because some buses travel to multiple stops; other students choose to [[carpool]] or drive themselves to school.

[[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas|METRO]] routes that serve DeBakey High School include 60 (South MacGregor/Hardy) and 68 (Brays Bayou Crosstown).

==Traditions==
DeBakey's official mascot is the viper, and some important school days that it celebrates include:
*Scientific Symposium- A list of seminars being held at the school in which experienced professionals around the Houston area give information about their lives.
*International Festival- A celebration emphasizing the cultures of the school, in which students dress up in their native culture and give cultural performances to the entire school.
*Talent Show- A two hour talent show that the entire school attends
*Field Day- A full day event in March that has fun activities for students, food, competitions among classes in many sports, and ultimately a class spirit performance.

==Feeder patterns==
DeBakey has no feeder patterns since it is a magnet school, so no students are zoned to it. DeBakey takes children from many Houston ISD middle schools.

Some students who are enrolled in private schools in the 8th grade choose to go to DeBakey for high school.<ref>"[http://www.stmes.org/aboutus.html About Us]."

''[[Presbyterian School]]''.</ref>

==Life after high school==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2013}}
Most DeBakey students end up at either the [[University of Houston]] or the [[University of Texas at Austin]] after graduation. A unique program specifically for DeBakey graduates known as the UH-Baylor program allows around 10 DeBakey students to be guaranteed admission to the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] after four years of classes at the University of Houston. A considerable amount attend private Texas schools such as [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]], [[Baylor University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]], and [[Houston Baptist University]], as well as out of state colleges such as [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], [[Loyola University New Orleans]], and [[Case Western University]]. DeBakey graduates are also represented in the nation's leading national universities such as [[Harvard University]], [[Rice University]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], [[Northwestern University]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[Notre Dame University]], [[Emory University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], as well as in top liberal arts colleges such as [[Amherst College]], [[Pomona College]], and [[Colgate University]].
