{{About|the American psychiatrist||Martin Kafka (rugby player)}}
'''Martin Paul Kafka''' (born 1947) is an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] best known for his work on [[sex offender]]s, [[paraphilia]]s and what he calls "paraphilia-related disorders" such as [[sex addiction]] and [[hypersexuality]].

==Career==
Kafka earned his undergraduate degree at [[Columbia College of Columbia University]] in 1968 and his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] cum laude in 1973 from the Medical College at [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center]]. He completed his psychiatric residency at the [[University of Michigan]] Medical Center in 1977.

He was Clinical Instructor of Psychiatry at University Hospital in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] from 1977 to 1983. He has taught at [[Harvard Medical School]] since 1983 and is affiliated with [[McLean Hospital]]. In 1999 Kafka was elected a full member of the [[International Academy of Sex Research]]. He joined the editorial board of ''Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment'' in 1999 and ''Sexual Addiction & Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention'' in 2001. Kafka was a charter member of the [[International Association for the Treatment of Sex Offenders]] (IATSO) in 2000. He has been president of the Massachusetts Chapter of the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (MATSA) from 2002–2008 and a member of the national ATSA ethics committee from 2004-05. In 2010 he was named a Distinguished Life Fellow of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. In 2008, Kafka was selected to be a member of the American Psychiatric Association's Work Group on Sexual and Gender Identity Disorder for the development of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' Fifth Edition, due for publication in 2012.

Kafka was the only American in a panel of eight non-Catholic scientists commissioned by the church to prepare a report on [[Catholic sex abuse cases]].<ref name="Bruni2004">Bruni, Frank (February 24, 2004).

Karl Hanson, Friedemann Pfäfflin, and Manfred Lütz (Vatican: Libreria Editrico Vaticana, 2004).</ref>

Kafka notes that "we don't know" the causes of atypical sexual behaviors. He cautions that "the research is in infancy," but it appears that physiological factors and environmental factors may both play roles.<ref name="bergner2005">Bergner, Daniel (January 23, 2005). [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/23/magazine/23PEDO.html The Making of a Molester.] ''The New York Times''</ref> Though sexual abusers of children are more likely to have been child sexual-abuse victims themselves, "most pedophiles have not been sexually abused." Kafka believes "social skills deficits" can be a factor.<ref name="bergner2005"/>

Kafka’s work on [[hypersexuality]] bases an evaluation on total sexual outlet. While previous treatments attempted to reduce [[androgen]] levels via [[chemical castration]], Kafka uses drugs that regulate [[monoamines]] such as [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]], but especially [[serotonin]]. He states that "sexual deviance is linked to an as-yet-unidentified disregulation affecting the serotonin system." After treating a sex offender among a group of people diagnosed with [[eating disorder]]s, Kafka connected the two: "I began to see that the sex offenders were just like the [[bulimia|bulimics]]. Both groups were suffering from a disregulation of appetite."<ref name="slater2000">Slater, Lauren (November 19, 2000).
