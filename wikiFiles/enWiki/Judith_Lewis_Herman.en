==Career==
Perhaps her most distinctive contribution to the understanding of trauma and its victims is the concept of [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] (CPTSD), which extends the [[diagnostic]] category [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) &mdash; a [[diagnosis]] that, according to the United States Veterans Administration's Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, "accurately describes the [[symptom]]s that result when a person experiences a short-lived [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]"<ref>{{cite web |last=Whealin,Ph.D.  |first=Julia M. |last2=Slone,Ph.D.|first2=Laurie |title=National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet: Complex PTSD |publisher=  [[National Center for PTSD]], [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]| date = 2007-05-22| url =http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/ncdocs/fact_shts/fs_complex_ptsd.html| doi = | accessdate = 2008-03-15 }}</ref> &mdash;  to include "the syndrome that follows upon prolonged, repeated trauma."<ref>{{cite book|title=Trauma and recovery: The aftermath of violence from domestic abuse to political terror |first=JL |last=Herman |year=1997|publisher=Basic Books |page=119}}</ref>
