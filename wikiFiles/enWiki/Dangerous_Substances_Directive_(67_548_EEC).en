== Scope==
The directive applies to pure chemicals and to mixtures of chemicals (''preparations'') that are ''placed on the market'' in the [[European Union]], therefore it does not apply directly to substances created purely for research purposes. Additional rules concerning preparations are contained in the [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]] (1999/45/EC):<ref name="1999-45-EC">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:200:0001:0068:EN:PDF Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'' L200, 30.7.1999, pp. 1–68.</ref> these are very similar to the rules contained in the Dangerous Substances Directive 67/548/EEC.<ref>The [[European Court of Justice]] ruled in 1985 that Directive 67/548/EEC applies only to pure substances, not preparations: ''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61984J0187:EN:HTML Re criminal proceedings against Giacomo Caldana]'' (Case 187/84 – Art. 177 (EEC) referral by the Pretore di Torino). Judgement 26.9.1985. ''European Court reports'' [1985] 3013.</ref> The directive does ''not'' apply to the following groups of substances and preparations (Art. 1):
* [[Cosmetics]], which are covered by the [[Cosmetics Directive]]
* [[Food]] for humans or animals
* [[Medicine]]s
* [[Pesticide]]s
* [[Radioactivity|Radioactive materials]]
* [[Waste]]
The directive does not apply to the transport of dangerous substances or preparations.

== Classification of dangerous substances ==
Art. 2 of the directive lists the classes of substances or preparations that are considered to be dangerous. Some, but not all, of these classes are associated with a [[Chemical_hazard_symbol#European_hazard_symbols|chemical hazard symbol]] and/or a code.
* [[Explosive]]s ('''E''')
* [[Oxidizing agent]]s ('''O''')
* [[Flammable]] substances or preparations, classified as ''extremely flammable'' ('''F+'''), ''highly flammable'' ('''F''')
* [[Toxic]] substances or preparations, classified as ''very toxic'' ('''T+''') or ''toxic'' ('''T''')
* Harmful substances or preparations ('''Xn''')
* [[Corrosive]] substances or preparations ('''C''')
* [[Irritation|Irritants]] ('''Xi''')
* [[Sensitizer]]s
* [[Carcinogen]]s ('''Carc.'''), classified into three categories
* [[Mutagen]]s ('''Mut.'''), classified into three categories
* Substances or preparations that are [[Reproductive toxicity|toxic for reproduction]] ('''Repr.'''), classified into three categories
* Substances or preparations that are dangerous for the environment ('''N''')
Substances or preparations falling into one or more of these classes are listed in Annex I of the directive, which is regularly updated. A public database of substances listed in Annex I is maintained by the [[Institute for Health and Consumer Protection]].

== Danger symbols ==
{{see also|European chemical hazard symbol|Dangerous goods}}
The danger symbols are defined in Annex II of the directive. A consolidated list with translations into other EU languages can be found in Directive 2001/59/EC.<ref name="2001-59-EC">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:225:0001:0333:EN:PDF Commission Directive 2001/59/EC of 6 August 2001 adapting to technical progress for the 28th time Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'' L225, 21.8.2001, pp. 1–333.</ref>

== Standard phrases ==
{{see also|Risk and Safety Statements}}
The standard phrases are defined in Annexes III and IV of the directive. Annex III defines phrases relating to the ''Nature of special risks attributed to dangerous substances and preparations'', often referred to as [[List of R-phrases|R-phrases]]. Annex IV defines phrases relating to ''Safety advice concerning dangerous substances and preparations'', often referred to as [[List of S-phrases|S-phrases]].

The appropriate standard phrases must appear on the packaging and label of the product and on its MSDS. Annex I specifies the standard phrases to be used for substances that are listed there: these are obligatory.

The lists of standard phrases were last updated in 2001, and Directive 2001/59/EC provides a consolidated list in all EU languages.<ref name="2001-59-EC" />

== Packaging requirements ==
(Art. 22) {{Expand section|date=January 2007}}

== Labelling requirements ==
(Arts. 23-25)
In general, the label on the packaging of a dangerous substance or preparation must clearly indicate the following items:
* The '''name''' of the substance; (for substances listed in Annex I, the name indicated must be one of those listed in the Annex (many substances appear in the Annex under different synonyms): otherwise, the name should be "''internationally recognized''")
* The name, full address and telephone number of the person or company which has placed the substance on the market (manufacturer, importer or distributor);
* The [[#Danger symbols|danger symbols]], if any;
* The [[#Standard phrases|standard phrases]], if any; (certain exemptions are permitted)
* The [[EINECS number]] or equivalent;
* For substances listed in Annex I, the words ''EEC label''.

== Material safety data sheet ==
Art. 27 of the directive imposes an obligation on suppliers to provide a [[material safety data sheet]], on paper or electronically, at or before the first delivery of a dangerous substance or preparation. The supplier is also obliged to inform users of any relevant new information which becomes known. Directive 2001/58/EC provides detailed guidance for the preparation of material safety data sheets.<ref name="2001-59-EC" />
