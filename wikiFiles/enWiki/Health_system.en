A '''health system''', also sometimes referred to as '''health care system''' or '''healthcare system''' is the [[organization]] of people, institutions, and resources to deliver [[health care]] services to meet the [[health]] needs of target populations.

There is a wide variety of health systems around the world, with as many histories and organizational structures as there are nations. In some countries, health system planning is distributed among market participants. In others, there is a concerted effort among [[government]]s, trade unions, charities, religious, or other co-ordinated bodies to deliver planned health care services targeted to the populations they serve. However, health care planning has been described as often evolutionary rather than revolutionary.<ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-ha.org.uk/health-care-system.html |title='&#39;Health care system'&#39; |publisher=Liverpool-ha.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/26/090126fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all ''New Yorker'' magazine article: "Getting there from here."] 26 Jan 2009</ref>

==Goals==
The goals for health systems, according to the [[World Health Organization]], are good health, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair financial contribution. Progress towards them depends on how systems carry out four vital functions: [[health care provider|provision of health care services]], resource generation, financing, and stewardship.<ref name="WHO2000">World Health Organization. (2000). ''World Health Report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance.'' Geneva, WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html</ref> Other dimensions for the evaluation of health systems include quality, efficiency, acceptability, and [[health equity|equity]].<ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk"/> They have also been described in the United States as "the five C's": Cost, Coverage, Consistency, Complexity, and [[chronic disease|Chronic Illness]].<ref>[http://web.jhu.edu/president/speeches/2007/health.html Remarks by Johns Hopkins University President William Brody: "Health Care '08: What's Promised/What's Possible?"] 7 Sept 2007</ref> Also, [[continuity of health care]] is a major goal.<ref name=cook2000>{{cite doi|10.1136/bmj.320.7237.791}}</ref>

==Definitions==
Often '''health system''' has been defined with a reductionist perspective, for example reducing it to '''health care system'''. In many publications, for example, both expressions are used interchangeably. Some authors<ref name="Frenk Global Health">Frenk J, The Global Health System : strengthening national health systems as the next step for global progress, ''Plos Medicine'', January 2010, Vol 7, issue 1, 3pp., available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797599/</ref> have developed arguments to expand the concept of health systems, indicating additional dimensions that should be considered:

* Health systems should not be expressed in terms of their components only, but also of their interrelationships;
* Health systems should include not only the institutional or supply side of the health system, but also the population;
* Health systems must be seen in terms of their goals, which include not only health improvement, but also [[Health equity|equity]], responsiveness to legitimate expectations, respect of dignity, and fair financing, among others;
* Health systems must also be defined in terms of their functions, including the direct provision of services, whether they are medical or [[public health]] services, but also "other enabling functions, such as stewardship, financing, and resource generation, including what is probably the most complex of all challenges, the health workforce."<ref name="Frenk Global Health"/>

===World Health Organization Definition===
The [[World Health Organization]] defines health system as follows:
<blockquote>
"A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities. A health system is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother caring for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector-control campaigns; health insurance organizations; occupational health and safety legislation. It includes inter-sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the ministry of education to promote female education, a well known determinant of better health."<ref>{{cite document|publisher=WHO|year=2007|title=Everybody's business. Strengthening health systems to improve health outcomes : WHO’s framework for action|url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/strategy/everybodys_business.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>

==Providers==

{{Main|Health care provider}}
Health care providers are institutions or individuals providing health care services. Individuals including health professionals and [[allied health professions]] can be self-employed or working as an employee in a [[hospital]], [[clinic]], or other health care institution, whether government operated, private for-profit, or private not-for-profit (e.g. non-governmental organization). They may also work outside of direct patient care such as in a government [[health department]] or other agency, [[medical laboratory]], or health training institution. Examples of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] are [[physician|doctors]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[midwifery|midwives]], [[dietetics|dietitians]], [[paramedic]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[medical laboratory technologist]]s, [[therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[Chiropractic|chiropractors]], [[Optometry|optometrists]], [[community health worker]]s, traditional medicine practitioners, and others.

[[Image:NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital(KatyAppleton)Aug2005.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]], a [[National Health Service]] hospital in the [[United Kingdom]].]]
There are generally five primary methods of funding health systems:<ref name = "WHO2">[http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section1243/Section1382/Section1731.htm "Regional Overview of Social Health Insurance in South-East Asia], [[World Health Organization]]. And [http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Social_Health_Insurance_2.pdf Overview of Health Care Financing"]. Retrieved August 18, 2006.</ref>

#general [[taxation]] to the state, county or municipality
#[[National health insurance|social health insurance]]
#voluntary or private [[health insurance]]
#[[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket payments]]
#[[donation]]s to [[charities]]

Most countries' systems feature a mix of all five models.  One study <ref>Glied, Sherry A. [http://papers.nber.org/papers/w13881 "Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity."] ''National Bureau of Economic Research,'' March 2008. Accessed March 20th, 2008.</ref> based on data from the [[OECD]] concluded that all types of health care finance "are compatible with" an efficient health system. The study also found no relationship between financing and cost control.

The term [[health insurance]] is generally used to describe a form of [[insurance]] that pays for medical expenses.  It is sometimes used more broadly to include insurance covering [[Disability insurance|disability]] or [[Long term care insurance|long-term nursing or custodial care]] needs.  It may be provided through a [[social insurance]] program, or from private insurance companies. It may be obtained on a group basis (e.g., by a firm to cover its employees) or purchased by individual consumers. In each case premiums or taxes protect the insured from high or unexpected health care expenses.

By estimating the overall cost of health care expenses, a routine finance structure (such as a monthly premium or annual tax) can be developed, ensuring that money is available to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is typically administered by a government agency, a non-profit health fund or a corporation operating seeking to make a profit.<ref>[http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/How-Private-Insurance-Works-A-Primer-Report.pdf How Private Insurance Works: A Primer] by Gary Claxton, Institution for Health Care Research and Policy, Georgetown University, on behalf of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation</ref>

Many forms of commercial health insurance control their costs by restricting the benefits that are paid by through [[deductible]]s, [[co-payment]]s, [[coinsurance]], policy exclusions, and total coverage limits and will severely restrict or refuse coverage of pre-existing conditions. Many government schemes also have co-payment schemes but exclusions are rare because of political pressure. The larger insurance schemes may also negotiate fees with providers.

Many forms of social insurance schemes control their costs by using the bargaining power of their community they represent to control costs in the health care delivery system. For example by negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies, or negotiating standard fees with the medical profession. Social schemes sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a scheme to deliver [[universal health care]], which may or may not also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers.  Essentially the more wealthy pay proportionately more into the scheme to cover the needs of the relatively poor who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).

In addition to these traditional health care financing methods, some lower income countries and development partners are also implementing non-traditional or [[innovative financing]] mechanisms for scaling up delivery and sustainability of health care,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bloom|first=G|coauthors=et al|title=Markets, Information Asymmetry And Health Care: Towards New Social Contracts|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2076–2087|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/markets-information-asymmetry-and-health-care-towards-new-so.html|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> such as micro-contributions, [[public-private partnership]]s, and market-based [[financial transaction tax]]es. For example, as of June 2011, [[UNITAID]] had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an air ticket solidarity levy to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.<ref name="UNITAID">UNITAID. [http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html ''Republic of Guinea Introduces Air Solidarity Levy to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.''] Geneva, 30 June 2011. Accessed 5 July 2011.</ref>

===Payment models===
In most countries, [[wage]] costs for health care practitioners are estimated to represent between 65% and 80% of renewable health system expenditures.<ref>Saltman RB, Von Otter C. ''Implementing Planned Markets in Health Care: Balancing Social and Economic Responsibility''. Buckingham: Open University Press 1995.</ref><ref>Kolehamainen-Aiken RL. Decentralization and human resources: implications and impact. ''Human Resources for Health Development'' 1997, 2(1):1-14.</ref> There are three ways to pay medical practitioners: fee for service, capitation, and salary. There has been growing interest in blending elements of these systems.<ref name="docteur/oxley"/>

====Fee-for-service====
''[[Fee-for-service]] arrangements'' pay [[general practitioner]]s (GPs) based on the service.<ref name="docteur/oxley"/> They are even more
widely used for specialists working in [[ambulatory care]].<ref name="docteur/oxley"/>

There are two ways to set fee levels:<ref name="docteur/oxley">{{cite journal|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/53/22364122.pdf|title=Health-Care Systems: Lessons from the Reform Experience|publisher=OECD|author=Elizabeth Docteur and Howard Oxley|year=2003}}</ref>
* By individual practitioners.
* Central negotiations (as in Japan, Germany, Canada and in France) or hybrid model (such as in Australia, France's sector 2, and New Zealand) where GPs can charge extra fees on top of standardized patient reimbursement rates.

====Capitation====
In ''[[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation payment systems]]'', GPs are paid for each patient on their "list", usually with adjustments for factors such as age and gender.<ref name="docteur/oxley"/> According to OECD, "these systems are used in Italy (with some fees), in all four countries of the United Kingdom (with some fees and allowances for specific services), Austria (with fees for specific services), Denmark (one third of income with remainder fee for service), Ireland (since 1989), the Netherlands (fee-for-service for privately insured patients and public employees) and Sweden (from 1994). Capitation payments have become more frequent in “managed care” environments in the United States."<ref name="docteur/oxley"/>

According to OECD, "Capitation systems allow funders to control the overall level of primary health expenditures, and the allocation of funding among GPs is determined by patient registrations. However, under this approach, GPs may register too many patients and under-serve them, select the better risks and refer on patients who could have been treated by the GP directly. Freedom of consumer choice over doctors, coupled with the principle of "money following the patient" may moderate some of these risks. Aside from selection, these problems are likely to be less marked than under salary-type arrangements."<ref name="docteur/oxley"/>

====Salary arrangements====
In several OECD countries, general practitioners (GPs) are employed on ''[[salary|salaries]]'' for the government.<ref name="docteur/oxley"/> According to OECD, "Salary arrangements allow funders to control primary care costs directly; however, they may lead to under-provision of services (to ease workloads), excessive referrals to secondary providers and lack of attention to the preferences of patients."<ref name="docteur/oxley"/> There has been movement away from this system.<ref name="docteur/oxley"/>

==Information resources==
{{Main|Health care delivery|Health information management|Health informatics|eHealth}}
Sound information plays an increasingly critical role in the delivery of modern health care and efficiency of health systems. Health informatics - the intersection of [[information science]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]] - deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition and use of information in health and biomedicine. Necessary tools for proper health information coding and management include [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]], formal [[Medical terminology|medical terminologies]], and computers and other [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]]. The kinds of data processed may include [[medical records|patients' medical records]], [[hospital information system|hospital administration and clinical functions]], and [[HRHIS|human resources information]].

The use of health information lies at the root of [[evidence-based policy]] and [[evidence-based management]] in health care. Increasingly, information and communication technologies are being utilised to improve health systems in developing countries through: the standardisation of health information; computer-aided diagnosis and treatment monitoring; informing population groups on health and treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=H|title=Information And Communications Technology For Future Health Systems In Developing Countries|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2122–2132|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/information-and-communications-technology-for-future-health.html|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref>

==Management==
{{Main|Health policy|Public health|Health administration|Disease management (health)}}
The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of [[health policy|policies and plans]] adopted by government, private sector business and other groups in areas such as personal health care delivery and financing, [[pharmaceutical policy|pharmaceuticals]], [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]], and [[public health]].

Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). Public health is typically divided into [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental]], social, [[behavioral health|behavioral]], and [[occupational health]] are also important subfields.

[[Image:Poliodrops.jpg|right|thumb|A child being immunized against [[polio]].]]
Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of ageing and [[health equity|health inequities]], although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a [[vaccination policy]], supporting public health programs in providing [[vaccination]]s to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries.  Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.

The rapid emergence of many [[chronic disease]]s, which require costly [[chronic care management|long-term care and treatment]], is making many health managers and policy makers re-examine their health care delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_hiv_aids.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System - HIV/Aides page |publisher=[[EUPHIX|Euphix]].org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> Another major public health concern is [[diabetes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_diabetes.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System - Diabetes page |publisher=Euphix.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of [[tobacco smoking]], linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_health_behaviours_smoking.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System - Smoking Behaviors page |publisher=Euphix.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>

[[Antibiotic resistance]] is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. The [[World Health Organization]], for its [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]] campaign, is calling for intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other [[antimicrobial]] medicines for future generations.

==Health systems performance==
Since 2000, more and more initiatives have been taken at the international and national levels in order to strengthen national health systems as the core components of the [[global health]] system. Having this scope in mind, it is essential to have a clear, and unrestricted, vision of national health systems that might generate further progresses in global health. The elaboration and the selection of [[performance indicator]]s are indeed both highly dependent on the [[conceptual framework]] adopted for the [[evaluation]] of the health systems performances.<ref>Handler A, Issel M, Turnock B. A conceptual framework to measure performance of the public health system. ''American Journal of Public Health'', 2001, 91(8): 1235-1239.</ref> Like most social systems, health systems are complex adaptive systems where change does not necessarily follow rigid epidemiological models. In complex systems path dependency, emergent properties and other non-linear patterns are under-explored and unmeasured,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paina|first=Ligia|coauthors=David Peters|title=Understanding pathways for scaling up health services through the lens of complex adaptive systems|journal=Health Policy and Planning|date=5|year=2011|month=August|volume=26|issue=5|doi=10.1093/heapol/czr054|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/understanding-pathways-for-scaling-up-health-services-throug.html|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> which can lead to the development of inappropriate guidelines for developing responsive health systems.<ref name="Peters 2012">{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=David|coauthors=Sara Bennet|title=Better Guidance Is Welcome, but without Blinders|journal=PLoS Med|year=2012|volume=9|issue=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001188|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/better-guidance-is-welcome-but-without-blinders.html|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref>

An increasing number of tools and guidelines are being published by international agencies and development partners to assist health system decision-makers to monitor and assess health systems strengthening<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/monitoring/en/index.html ''Monitoring the building blocks of health systems: a handbook of indicators and their measurement strategies''.] Geneva, WHO Press, 2010.</ref> including [[Health Human Resources|human resources]] development<ref>Dal Poz MR et al. [http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health.''] Geneva, WHO Press, 2009</ref> using standard definitions, indicators and measures. In response to a series of papers published in 2012 by members of the World Health Organization's Task Force on Developing Health Systems Guidance, researchers from the Future Health Systems consortium argue that there is insufficient focus on the 'policy implementation gap'.  Recognizing the diversity of stakeholders and complexity of health systems is crucial to ensure that evidence-based guidelines are tested with requisite humility and without a rigid adherence to models dominated by a limited number of disciplines.<ref name="Peters 2012"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hyder|first=A|coauthors=Et al|title=Exploring health systems research and its influence on policy processes in low income countries|journal=BMC Public Health|year=2007|volume=7|pages=309|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/exploring-health-systems-research-and-its-influence-on-polic.html|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref>

Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) is an emerging multidisciplinary field that challenges 'disciplinary capture' by dominant health research traditions, arguing that these traditions generate premature and inappropriately narrow definitions that impede rather than enhance health systems strengthening.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheikh|first=Kabir|coauthors=Lucy Gilson, Irene Akua Agyepong, Kara Hanson, Freddie Ssengooba, Sara Bennett|title=Building the Field of Health Policy and Systems Research: Framing the Questions|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2011|volume=8|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001073|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/building-the-field-of-health-policy-and-systems-research-fra.html|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> HPSR focuses on low- and middle-income countries and draws on the relativist social science paradigm which recognises that all phenomena are constructed through human behaviour and interpretation. In using this approach, HPSR offers insight in to health systems by generating a complex understanding of context in order to enhance health policy learning.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gilson|first=Lucy|coauthors=Kara Hanson, Kabir Sheikh, Irene Akua Agyepong, Freddie Ssengooba, Sara Bennet|title=Building the Field of Health Policy and Systems Research: Social Science Matters|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2011|volume=8|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001079|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/building-the-field-of-health-policy-and-systems-research-soc.html|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> HPSR calls for greater involvement of local actors, including policy makers, civil society and researchers, in decisions that are made around funding health policy research and health systems strengthening.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bennet|first=Sara|coauthors=Irene Akua Agyepong, Kabir Sheikh, Kara Hanson, Freddie Ssengooba, Lucy Gilson|title=Building the Field of Health Policy and Systems Research: An Agenda for Action|journal=PLoS|year=2011|volume=8|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001081|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/building-the-field-of-health-policy-and-systems-research-an.html|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

==International comparisons==
{{See also|Health systems by country}}
Health systems can vary substantially from country to country, and in the last few years, comparisons have been made on an international basis. The [[World Health Organization]], in its ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2000]]'', provided a [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|ranking of health systems]] around the world according to criteria of the overall level and distribution of [[health]] in the populations, and the responsiveness and fair financing of health care services.<ref name="WHO2000"/> The goals for health systems, according to the WHO's ''World Health Report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance'' (WHO, 2000),<ref>World Health Organization. (2000) [http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/ ''World Health Report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance'']. Geneva, WHO Press.</ref> are good health, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair financial contribution. There have been several debates around the results of this WHO exercise,<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health-systems-performance/docs/overallframework_docs.htm ''Health Systems Performance: Overall Framework.''] Accessed 15 March 2011.</ref> and especially based on the country [[ranking]] linked to it,<ref>Navarro V. Assessment of the World Health Report 2000. ''Lancet'' 2000; 356: 1598–601</ref> insofar as it appeared to depend mostly on the choice of the retained [[indicators]].

Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations are complex. The [[Commonwealth Fund]], in its annual survey, "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall", compares the performance of the health systems in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the U.S. Its 2007 study found that, although the U.S. system is the most expensive, it consistently underperforms compared to the other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/Fund-Reports/2007/May/Mirror--Mirror-on-the-Wall--An-International-Update-on-the-Comparative-Performance-of-American-Healt.aspx|title=Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International Update on the Comparative Performance of American Health Care|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|date=May 15, 2007|accessdate=March 7, 2009}}</ref> A major difference between the U.S. and the other countries in the study is that the U.S. is the only country without [[universal health care]].
