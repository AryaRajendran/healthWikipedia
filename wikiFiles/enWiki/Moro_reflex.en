The '''Moro reflex''' is an [[infantile reflex]] normally present in all infants/newborns up to 4 or 5 months of age as a response to a sudden loss of support, when the infant feels as if it is falling. It involves 3 distinct components:
# spreading out the [[arm]]s ([[Anatomical terms of motion|abduction]])
# unspreading the arms ([[Anatomical terms of motion|adduction]])
# [[crying]] (usually)
The primary significance of the Moro reflex is in evaluating integration of the [[central nervous system]]. It is distinct from the [[Startle reaction|startle reflex]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Mary Ann |title=Physical Diagnosis in Neonatology |year=1998 |publisher=Lippincott-Raven |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0397513864 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2chdTE4SHE8C&lpg=PA472&vq=moro%20reflex&pg=PA472#v=snippet&q=moro%20reflex&f=false |accessdate=7 February 2013 |page=472}}</ref> and is believed to be the only unlearned [[fear]] in human newborns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Interpretation==
The Moro reflex may be observed in incomplete form in [[premature birth]] after the 28th week of [[gestation]], and is usually present in complete form by week 34 ([[third trimester]]). Absence or [[asymmetry]] of either abduction or adduction is abnormal, as is persistence of the reflex in older infants, children and [[adult]]s. Absence indicates a profound disorder of the [[motor system]]. An absent or inadequate Moro response on one side is found in infants with [[hemiplegia]], [[brachial plexus]] [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]], or a fractured [[clavicle]]. Persistence of the Moro response beyond 4 or 5 months of age is noted only in infants with severe neurological defects.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuels |first1=Martin A. |authorlink1=Martin A.

==History==
The reflex was discovered and first described by Austrian [[pediatrician]] [[Ernst Moro]] (1874–1951). In [[human evolution|human evolutionary history]], the Moro reflex may have helped the infant cling to its mother while she carried it around all day. If the infant lost its balance, the reflex caused the infant to embrace its mother and regain its hold on the mother’s body.<ref name=berk>{{cite book |last=Berk |first=Laura E. |title=Child Development |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-61559-9 |url=http://www.mypearsonstore.com/bookstore/child-development-9780205615599 |edition=8th |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>
