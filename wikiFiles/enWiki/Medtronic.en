== History ==
[[File:2009-0610-001-Fridley-MedtronicHQ.JPG|350px|left|thumb|Medtronic World Headquarters, [[Fridley, Minnesota]], also a suburb of Minneapolis.]]
Medtronic was founded in 1949 in a [[Garage (house)|garage]] in northeast [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] by [[Earl Bakken]] and his brother-in-law [[Palmer Hermundslie]] as a medical equipment repair shop.  They originally wanted to sell basketball pumps due to a shortage in the Midwest in the 20th century. Bakken began as a graduate student in electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota before he gave up his studies to focus on Medtronic.

Through their repair business, Bakken came to know [[C. Walton Lillehei]], a pioneer in the field of [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]] then at the [[University of Minnesota Medical School]].  Lillehei was frustrated with the [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] of the day, which were quite large, applied electrical current externally requiring higher voltages, and had to be plugged in to a [[mains electricity|wall outlet]] to operate.  The deficiencies of such pacemakers were made painfully obvious following a [[power outage]] over Halloween in 1957 which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.<ref>[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/29/batterypacemaker/ MPR Story]</ref>  As a direct result of this blackout, a [[pediatrics|pediatric]] patient of Dr. Lillehei who was pacemaker-dependent died.  The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker.  Stemming from this need, Bakken modified a design for a transistorized metronome to create the first battery-powered external [[artificial pacemaker]].
[[File:2012-0907-OldMedtronicHQ.jpg|thumb|right|Medtronic's old headquarters in St. Anthony.]]

The company expanded through the 1950s, mostly selling equipment built by other companies, but also developing some custom devices. Bakken built a small [[transistor]]ized pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]].  Work into this new field continued, producing an [[implant (medicine)|implant]]able pacemaker in 1960.  It built a headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of [[St. Anthony, Minnesota|St. Anthony]] in 1960.<ref name=TCBiz090612>Sam Black, [http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/real_estate/2012/09/islamic-group-buys-st-anthony.html Old Medtronic headquarters is sold to Islamic group], ''Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal'', September 6, 2012, accessed March 14, 2013.</ref> It moved to Fridley by the 1970s. Medtronic's main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include [[Stryker Corporation]], [[Boston Scientific]] and [[St. Jude Medical]].

The company remains focused on the mission originally written by co-founder [[Earl Bakken]] in the early-1960s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The first sentence of the six-paragraph mission statement reads:

{{cquote|To contribute to human welfare by application of biomedical engineering in the research, design, manufacture, and sale of instruments or appliances that alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life.<ref>[http://www.medtronic.com/about-medtronic/our-mission/index.htm accessed April 20, 2012]</ref>}}

Since 2008 and the global financial crisis, Medtronic stock value dropped dramatically. Despite sales and margin well above the average of most industries, with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60%, Medtronic initiated a series of restructurings, in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

== Business units==

Medtronic is composed of six main business units which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including [[heart failure]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[urinary incontinence]], [[obesity]], [[chronic pain]], spinal disorders, and [[diabetes]].

=== CRDM ===
CRDM (Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management) is the oldest and largest of Medtronic's business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when co-founder Earl Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally slow heart rates. Since then, CRDM has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. CRDM has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer [[Vitatron]] was acquired by Medtronic in 1986, and now it is a European subsidiary of Medtronic CRDM unit.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/1997/07/21/story6.html | first=John | last=Manning | date=1997-07-20 | title=Vitatron, medtronic integrate sales force}}</ref> Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices, using separate interfaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manuals.medtronic.com/wcm/groups/mdtcom_sg/@emanuals/@era/@crdm/documents/documents/m931556a001_cont_20090206.pdf |title=MEDTRONIC CARELINK

===Spinal & Biologics===
Spinal and Biologics is Medtronic's second largest business, and Medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies.  In 2007, Medtronic purchased Kyphon, a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants necessary for procedures like [[kyphoplasty]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Medtronic to acquire Kyphon |date=July 27, 2007 |author=Joshua Freed |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-07-27-3280975318_x.htm}}</ref>

In May, 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the U.S. government $75 million to settle a qui tam (whistleblower) lawsuit alleging that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient rather than outpatient procedure, thereby making thousands more in profits per surgery.<ref>[http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/2008/Medtronic-unit-will-pay-75-million-to-settle-whistleblower-Medicare-fraud-case.shtml "Medtronic unit will pay $75 million to settle whistleblower Medicare fraud case"] Phillips & Cohen LLP Press Release. May 22, 2008.</ref>

A "special report" by writer [[Steven Brill (journalist)|Steven Brill]] in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] showed that according to Medtronic's quarterly SEC filing of October 2012 the company has on average a 75,1% profit margin on its spine products and therapies.<ref>[http://theglobalrealm.com/2013/02/28/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/ "Bitter Pill: Why medical bills are killing us"] Time, 28 February 2013</ref>

=== CardioVascular===

Medtronic's therapies in this business span the major specialties of interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, and vascular surgery.  The products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary, aortic, and structural heart disease.

In 2007, Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis product, consisting of the flexible wires, or leads, which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart.  The Sprint Fidelis leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, resulting in unnecessary shocks or a failure to administer a shock when needed; either can be lethal. The scope of this problem continues to be a matter of research. Studies since the recall, disputed by Medtronic, suggest the failure rate of already-implanted Sprint Fidelis leads is increasing exponentially.  Medtronic liability in this matter is limited by various court decisions.<ref name="WSJ2010">{{cite news|title=Hospitals Dispute Medtronic Data on Wires |last=Burton |first=Thomas M. |date=4 February 2010|publisher=Wall Street Journal|pages=D6|accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref>

===Neuromodulation===

Products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain, common movement disorders, and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders.

===Diabetes===
Medtronic Diabetes is the [[diabetes]] management manufacturing and sales division of Medtronic, based in Northridge, California.<ref>[http://www.minimed.com/help/contact/index.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>  The original company, [[Minimed Technologies]], was founded in the early 1980s and spun off from [[Pacesetter Systems]] in order to design a practical [[insulin pump]] for lifelong wear.  Most devices at the time were either too large or impossible to program and extremely unreliable.  The release of the lightweight, menu-driven MiniMed 500 series changed the landscape, and was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream. In 1996, the minimed was redesigned by the innovation consulting [[RKS Design]] to look more flashy, more elegant, and resemble a beeper; the friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate and sales increased by 357%.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pierson |first=John |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269598/index.htm |title=Style And Substance: Why Design Matters Many small-business owners believe they can't afford good product design. Why some companies are rethinking that equation. - November 22, 1999 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=1999-11-22 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}</ref> In the early 2000s Medtronic purchased Minimed to form Medtronic Minimed.<ref>[http://www.minimed.com/about/history.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>

Current models consist of the [[MiniMed Paradigm]] 523/723 and Paradigm Real-time Revel system<ref>[http://www.minimed.com/products/insulinpumps/index.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> and Guardian Real-time system.<ref>[http://www.minimed.com/products/guardian/index.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> It is the first insulin pump which integrates continuous [[blood glucose monitoring]], allowing patients to see in real time their glucose level. As well as insulin pumps, Medtronic Diabetes also makes Continuous Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS) for use as stand alone systems or integrated into its Minimed Paradigm 523/723 series pumps. The company also makes and/or markets a large range of accessories and components for its insulin pump and CGMS products.

As of March 2007 the MiniMed name has begun to be absorbed into the parent company, Medtronic. Medtronic has kept the MiniMed name to brand their insulin pumps, for example the MiniMed Paradigm 722. As Medtronic frequently uses Medtronic Diabetes as the name for the division, it is unclear to the extent the division will be integrated into Medtronic. Although Medtronic [http://www.minimed.com/ MiniMed] has its own website, and many products and marketing material still bear its name, the brand is being phased out.

On May 11, 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen [[San Antonio, Texas]] for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center.  The company announced that it expected 1,400 new jobs would be created to staff the {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wwwp.medtronic.com/Newsroom/NewsReleaseDetails.do?itemId=1242054328624&lang=en_US| title=Medtronic Announces San Antonio as Home of New Diabetes Facility | date=2009-05-11 | accessdate=2009-05-11 | publisher=Medtronic}}</ref>

===Surgical Technologies===
[[File:Передвижной американский томограф (ФЦН Тюмень).JPG|thumb|O-arm ® Surgical Imaging System. ''[[:ru:Федеральный центр нейрохирургии (Тюмень)|Federal Center for Neurosurgery in Tyumen]], 2013'']]
The Surgical Technologies business designs and manufactures products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal, and neurologic conditions. It also encompasses a surgical navigation division that designs "StealthStation" systems, software and instruments for Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative imaging system known as the O-arm® Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally invasive surgical procedures.

===Technology Safety===

Jay Radcliffe, an independent security researcher presented a speech at the BlackHat 2011. He revealed a security vulnerability in the Medtronic brand insulin pump, allowing an attacker remote control of that pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of their devices.<ref>{{cite web|author=JORDAN ROBERTSON - AP Technology Writer |url=http://news.yahoo.com/insulin-pump-maker-identified-hacking-talk-170230893.html |title=Insulin pump maker identified after hacking talk - Yahoo!
