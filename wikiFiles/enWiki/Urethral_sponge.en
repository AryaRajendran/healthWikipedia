The '''urethral sponge''' is a spongy cushion of [[biological tissue|tissue]], found in the lower [[genitals|genital area]] of women, that sits against both the [[pubic bone]] and [[vagina]]l wall, and surrounds the [[urethra]].
==Functions==
The urethral sponge is composed of [[erectile tissue]]; during [[sexual arousal|arousal]], it becomes swollen with blood, compressing the urethra, helping prevent [[urination]] during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] (along with the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]).

===Female ejaculation===
{{Main|Female ejaculation}}
Additionally, the urethral sponge contains the [[Skene's gland]]s, which might be involved in [[female ejaculation]].

===Sexual stimulation===
The urethral sponge encompasses sensitive [[nerve|nerve ending]]s, and can be stimulated through the front wall of the [[vagina]]. Some women experience intense [[pleasure]] from stimulation of the urethral sponge and others find the sensation irritating. The urethral sponge surrounds the [[Clitoris|clitoral]] nerve, and since the two are so closely interconnected, stimulation of the clitoris may stimulate the nerve endings of the urethral sponge.<ref name="Cornforth">{{cite web|first=Tracee|last=Cornforth|title=The Clitoral Truth. Interview with author and sexologist Rebecca Chalker.|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=17 July 2009|accessdate=21 April 2010|url=http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/sexuality/a/clitoraltruthin_2.htm}}</ref> Some women enjoy the [[doggy position|rear-entry position]] of [[sexual intercourse]] for this reason, because the [[penis]] is often angled slightly downward and can stimulate the front wall of the [[vagina]], and in turn the urethral sponge.

===Relation with the G-Spot===
{{Main|G-Spot}}

The urethral sponge is an area in which the G-Spot (Gr√§fenberg Spot) may be found.<ref name="Cornforth"/> Although the G-Spot may exist, it has been doubted by various researchers. A team at [[King's College London|The King's College]] in London, the biggest study on the G-Spot's existence thus far, and involving 1,800 women, found no proof that the G-Spot exists. The authors of the study concluded that the "G-Spot" may be a figment of people's imagination, which has been encouraged by magazines, sex therapists and suggestive therapeutics.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8439000.stm |work=BBC News | title=G-spot 'doesn't appear to exist' | date=4 January 2010 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref><ref>http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1743-6095</ref> Other studies, using [[ultrasound]], have found physiological evidence of the G-Spot in women who report having orgasms during intercourse.<ref name="Aquila">{{cite journal |author=Gravina GL, Brandetti F, Martini P, ''et al.'' |title=Measurement of the Thickness of the Urethrovaginal Space in Women with or without Vaginal Orgasm |journal=J Sex Med |volume= 5|issue=  3|pages=610|year=2008 |pmid=18221286 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00739.x}}</ref><ref name="CNNreal">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/05/g.spot.sex.women/index.html |title=Finding the G-spot: Is it real?|publisher=[[CNN]].com|date=5 January 2010|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>
