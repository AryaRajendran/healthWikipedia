It focuses mainly on educating women aged forty to sixty, as that is the time when the risk of heart disease begins to increase.<ref name="ht"/>

== Campaign history ==
The campaign began in March 2001 on recommendation from over seventy experts on the health of women.<ref name="ht"/> The research stressed the need to communicate to women about the risk of heart disease, and endorsed The Heart Truth as a means of doing so.<ref name="ht"/>

== Logo and marketing ==
The [[logo]] of the campaign is a red dress. It came into being as a way to attract attention to the Heart Truth, and eliminate perceptions that heart disease is an issue only for men.<ref name="ht"/> The dress reminds women to focus on their "outerselves", as well as their "innerselves", especially heart health.<ref name="ht"/>

The campaign has also conjured a [[National Wear Red Day]], meant to take place on the first Friday of February annually.<ref name="ht"/>

== Events ==
