{{Update|or superseded by the current consideration of the '''[[Affordable Health Care for America&nbsp;Act]]''', H.R.&nbsp;3962|date=February 2010}}
{{Health care reform in the United States}}
The proposed '''America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009''' (or '''HR 3200''')<ref>{{USBill|111|H.R.|3200}}</ref> was an unsuccessful bill introduced in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on July 14, 2009. The bill was introduced during the first session of the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] as part of an effort of the Democratic Party leadership to enact health care reform. The bill was not approved by the House, but was superseded by a similar bill, the proposed [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]] (HR 3962), which was passed by the House in November 2009, by a margin of 220-215 votes.

A similar bill to HR 3200, called the "Affordable Health Choices Act" (HR 1679)<ref>{{USBill|111|S.|1679}}</ref>), was introduced in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on September 17, 2009. It too was unsuccessful as the Senate approved instead another proposal called the "[[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]".

According to the [[Congressional Budget Office]], HR 3200 includes tax increases and spending cuts that reduce the net increase in the federal deficit to 1% of 2008 tax revenues. The CBO director subsequently noted that, in terms of total National Health Expenditure, non-governmental spending will increase as coverage expands.<ref name="CBO Report-July 14">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10464/hr3200.pdf |title=CBO Report-July 14 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090903183129/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10464/hr3200.pdf| archivedate= 3 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=336 |title=Director’s Blog " Blog Archive " The Effects of Health Reform Legislation beyond the Next Decade |publisher=Cboblog.cbo.gov |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2009-09-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090830181337/http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=336| archivedate= 30 August 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===House Committees' mark-ups===
America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 has been amended in the nature of substitute during mark-up proceedings since its original introduction recorded in the Congressional Record on July 14, 2009. These amendments have only been voted on by each Committee involved in order to pass out of the Committee phase but have not been voted on by the full House membership, which is needed before the originally introduced legislation can be changed to reflect any amendments recommended by the Committees and passed by a full House vote.

==CBO analysis of the bill==
The U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]] is a non-partisan organization that analyzes the effect on the federal budget of proposed and existing legislation on behalf of the Congress. CBO analyzed the bill as of July 14, 2009 and reported the following:<ref name="CBO Report-July 14" />

{{Quote|"According to CBO’s and JCT’s assessment, enacting H.R. 3200 would result in a net increase in the federal budget deficit of $239 billion over the 2010–2019 period. That estimate reflects a projected 10-year cost of the bill’s insurance coverage provisions of $1,042 billion, partly offset by net spending changes that CBO estimates would save $219 billion over the same period, and by revenue provisions that JCT estimates would increase federal revenues by about $583 billion over those 10 years."}}

In terms of what would happen for consumers, the CBO's methodology in a report in late July used a public plan with premiums about 10% lower than private plans.<ref name=AP/>

==Health exchange details==
Businesses with ten or fewer employees can use the exchange in the first year after the act begins. The cutoff changes to twenty or fewer employees the next year. On the third year, the 'Health Choices Commissioner' has the authority to phase in businesses with more employees. The legislation does not specify any further phases, leaving that up to the officer to decide.<ref name=weiner>[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/28/anthony-weiner/employers-dont-have-keep-coverage-under-health-ref/ Weiner mangles details of health care reform]. [[PolitiFact]]. Retrieved August 30, 2009.</ref>

The act creates new standards, indented by lawmakers as methods of [[consumer protection]], for what would be considered a minimally acceptable insurance plan. Employers that currently offer insurance have a five year grace period after the act begins before they would subject to the standards. Individuals would be free to purchase their own private insurance, or work with the public option, in this period and afterward.<ref name=weiner/>

==Health Benefits Advisory Committee==
According to [[s:H.R. 3200/Division A/Title I/Subtitle C#Sec. 123.|Division A, Title I, Subtitle C, Section 123 of HR 3200]], a Health Benefits Advisory Committee shall be established to be chaired by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]].  It will consist of 9 more individuals who are not federal employees that are appointed by the [[President of the United States]].  It will also consist of 9 members who are appointed by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]].  Also, up to eight more members will be appointed in even numbers by the [[President of the United States]] who are federal employees and officers.  Each member of the committee will serve three year terms.  The Health Benefits Advisory Committee will recommend to the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]] benefit standards and periodic updates to such standards.

The "death panel" argument was endorsed by an erroneous editorial in the ''[[Investor's Business Daily]]'', which analogized the bill to the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the [[United Kingdom]] and editorialized: "People such as scientist [[Stephen Hawking]] wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless."<ref>{{Cite news| title = How House Bill Runs Over Grandma| newspaper = [[Investor's Business Daily]]| date = July 31, 2009| url = http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=503058}}</ref> The Investor's Business Daily editorialists had to beat a retreat and quickly retracted its claim after it was pointed out that Hawking is in fact British, and has lived his entire life in the United Kingdom with treatment from the NHS.<ref>{{cite web| last = Bookman| first = Jay| title = It doesn’t take Stephen Hawking to figure this one out| publisher = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]| date = August 10, 2009| url = http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2009/08/10/it-doesnt-take-stephen-hawking-to-figure-this-one-out/| accessdate = 2009-08-11}}</ref> Stephen Hawking responded, "I wouldn’t be here today if it were not for the NHS.

===Competition===
A [[CNN]] report has stated that the proposed public option is a '[[lightning rod]]' in American public opinion about healthcare reform.<ref name=split/> Republicans, people with the insurance industry, and employer groups have discussed the concern that the availability of a public plan would make it difficult for private insurers to compete. This may then lead to a situation where most people end up being covered by the public insurance option.<ref name=AP/><ref name=scare>{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/06/more-health-care-scare/|author=Lori Robertson|title=More Health Care Scare|date=June 11, 2009|publisher=[[FactCheck.org]]}}</ref>

The [[Congressional Budget Office]]'s analysis in late July stated that this would not be the case for the "[[public option]]" included in H.R. 3200, projecting that only about 11 to 12 million people would enroll in the public option. The [[Lewin Group]], a research firm that is part of a subsidiary of [[UnitedHealth Group]] but is run independently,<ref name=scare/> has estimated that over 100 million people would join the public plan if it were structured like [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], which would then make it the dominant insurer.<ref name=AP>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/congressional_budget_office_pu.html|title=Congressional Budget Office: 'Public option' plan would not drive private health insurance out of business|date=July 27, 2009|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref> 

A model similar to one proposed by the late Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] would bring in between 21.5 million and 67.5 million according to the group. A 2008 report by the [[Urban Institute]] stated the public option would probably settle into a '[[niche market|niche]]' in the insurance market with other firms still able to compete.<ref name=scare/>

The bill bases the publicly authorized insurance plan fees on industry averages, so there is no clear economic competitive advantage versus existing private insurance. The health insurance subsidy is available to anyone with a qualifying level of income buying insurance from the exchange regardless of whether they choose a public or private plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirseiu.org/What_Is_the_Public_Health_Insurance_Option__.aspx|title=What Is the Public Health Insurance Option? }}</ref> A poll done by ''Penn, Schoen and Berland Associates'' for the [[AARP]] stated that only 37% of Americans correctly identified the definition of the 'public option' being proposed, numbers very close to respondents guessing randomly among answers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Divided We Remain|url=http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2009/0825/20090825_070303_HealthCarePoll.pdf|date=August 25, 2009|accessdate=August 28, 2009|publisher=[[AARP]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091007173207/http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2009/0825/20090825_070303_HealthCarePoll.pdf| archivedate= 7 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Town halls===
A number of [[town hall meeting]]s held by members of Congress during the August 2009 congressional recess were the site of protests and disruptions by opponents of this health care reform legislation.<ref name="nyt7">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/us/politics/08townhall.html|title=Beyond Beltway, Health Debate Turns Hostile | work=The New York Times | first=Ian | last=Urbina | date=August 8, 2009 | accessdate=April 7, 2010}}</ref>  [[Steven Pearlstein]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the concerns raised in most of these town hall disruptions are factually incorrect claims made by some conservative members of Congress and some in the [[right-wing]] media in opposition of the reform bill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/06/AR2009080603854.html|title=Republicans Propagating Falsehoods in Attacks on Health-Care Reform | work=The Washington Post | first=Steven | last=Pearlstein | date=August 7, 2009 | accessdate=April 7, 2010}}</ref> Wendell Potter, who has been an executive of [[Cigna]], a for-profit health insurer, stated that health insurance companies "are very much behind the town hall disruptions that you see and a lot of the deception that’s going on in terms of disinformation that many Americans, apparently, are believing."<ref>{{cite web | last = Maddow| first = Rachel   | authorlink = Rachel Maddow | title = Health insurance is a big money business| work = Video| publisher = [[MSNBC]]| date = August 10, 2009| url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#32365982| accessdate = 2009-08-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090806113404/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/| archivedate= 6 August 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Many proponents of the reform bill have accused organizations such as [[FreedomWorks]], a corporate and individual funded activist group, of organizing these protests to look like grassroots opposition.<ref name="nyt7" /><ref name=summer/> FreedomWorks representatives have stated that they represent grassroots dissatisfaction and disputed the allegations.<ref name=summer/> The chairman of FreedomWorks is former Republican [[House Majority Leader]] and [[healthcare industry|healthcare lobbyist]] [[Dick Armey]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Chairman Dick Armey | publisher = [[FreedomWorks]] | url = http://www.freedomworks.org/about/chairman-dick-armey | accessdate = 2009-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090827033152/http://www.freedomworks.org/about/chairman-dick-armey| archivedate= 27 August 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Health Care for America Now (HCAN), a union and individual-funded liberal activist group, organized and co-ordinated health care reform proponents in the town hall meetings.

The [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), a labor union, has been accused by opponents of the reform bill of busing paid operatives into town halls to demonstrate in support of the measure. The group denies the accusation.<ref name=summer/>

[[Rasmussen Reports]] found in a late-August survey that a 49% plurality of Americans believe that protesters genuinely express their own views while 37% consider them to be a creation of special interest groups and lobbyists.<ref name=falling>{{cite web|date=August 27, 2009|title=Support for Health Care Legislation Has Stopped Falling, But Most Still Opposed|publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]]|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/august_2009/support_for_health_care_legislation_has_stopped_falling_but_most_still_opposed|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref> An early-August survey stated that 35% viewed the protests unfavorably and 41% viewed them favorably.<ref name=favor>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/august_2009/41_view_town_hall_protesters_favorably_35_don_t|title=41% View Town Hall Protesters Favorably, 35% Don’t|date=August 7, 2009|publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]]|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref> Both polls showed highly partisan differences in people's view of the town halls.<ref name=falling/><ref name=favor/>

===Medicare issues===
[[Ezra Klein]] has written in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in late August that, in his opinion, polls now indicate that senior citizens are becoming fearful of healthcare reform, due to concerns that funding subsidies for the uninsured would require cuts to the popular Medicare program. He said that the specific changes "don't involve anything of the kind (most of the savings would come from reducing overpayments to the private insurers that participate in the Medicare Advantage program)". He argued that, as a result, an odd but potent political alliance has emerged with Republicans arguing to protect the existing Medicare program despite its position historically which has been to oppose Medicare as an entitlement.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/28/AR2009082802109.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 "No Government Health Care! (Except for Mine.)"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Published August 28, 2009. Retrieved August 30, 2009.</ref>

[[Peter R. Orszag]], the then director of the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]], argued in June 2008 that the Medicare program as currently structured is unsustainable without significant reform, as tax revenues dedicated to the program are not sufficient to cover its rapidly increasing expenditures.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9385/06-17-LTBO_Testimony.pdf The Long-Term Budget Outlook and Options for Slowing the Growth of Health Care Costs]. [[Congressional Budget Office]]. Presented June 2008.</ref> According to the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]], spending on Medicare will grow from $485 billion during 2009 to $879 billion by 2018.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8917/01-23-2008_BudgetOutlook.pdf CBO Budget Outlook] p53 Table 3-1</ref> President Obama said at a White House news conference on July 22 that, without changes, the system is guaranteed “to basically break the federal budget”. He argued that it is necessary to cut wasteful spending which is known to exist (over-testing, no IT, lack of co-ordination, hospital re-admissions) in order to cut costs in order to protect Medicare in the future and cut the projected national deficit.<ref>White House news conference http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/News-Conference-by-the-President-July-22-2009/</ref>

The act, as currently structured, does not cut present Medicare benefits. It reduces projected future increases in Medicare spending such as inpatient hospital service payments and ambulatory care payments that would otherwise undergo annual re-adjustments. These changes would save $196 billion from Medicare over 10 years and removing wasteful subsidies to insurers for Medicare Advantage plan would save a further $156 billion according to the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]].<ref>[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/14/barack-obama/obama-claims-medicare-benefits-will-not-be-cut-und/ Obama claims Medicare benefits will not be cut under the health care bill].

===Illegal immigrants===
HR 3200 states that illegal immigrants are not eligible for the proposed taxpayer-funded affordable premium credits. Republicans have stated that there is nothing in the bill to enforce this.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/32788556#32788556|title=After the outburst, a call for clarity|publisher=[[MSNBC.com]]|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}</ref> A group of 21 House Democrats, led by Rep. Michael M. Honda, are trying to change those requirements. He has argued that the restriction "will only add to uncompensated care costs and costly emergency room visits.

With skyrocketing health care costs, legislators should do all that we can to contain costs for working American families".<ref name="Honda">http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ca15_honda/Health_090923.html Text of letters from Rep. Honda and leaders within the Congressional Tri-Caucus, the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), and other Members of Congress to key players in the reform debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate.</ref> The [[Center for Immigration Studies]] has also commented on the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cis.org/IllegalHealthcareReform|title=Health Reform Legislation and Immigration|publisher=[[Center for Immigration Studies]]|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref>

===Abortion funding===
The [[Hyde Amendment]] prohibits federal funding for abortions in government related health programs unless they are performed in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. A political controversy has broken out about whether or not the 'public plan' in HR 3200 will cover abortions, which, if done, would be funded by premiums paid by individuals to that agency and not by outside payments. After rejecting Democratic Rep. [[Lois Capps]]'s amendment to segregate abortion funding, the House or Representatives voted for tighter restrictions on federal funding for elective abortions via the [[Stupak Amendment]].

==Ad campaign funding==
"America's Health Insurance Plans", a lobbyist group, opposed the bill.<ref>http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ahip-statement-on-house-passage-of-hr-3962-69495227.html</ref>

'Americans for Stable Quality Care' is an activist group that has devised television ads in support of this type of healthcare reform. Although the group gets funding from the [[drug lobby]] [[PhRMA]] as well as from the [[Service Employees International Union]], it does not disclose this fact in the ads themselves. The head of the [[Public Relations Society of America]], Michael Cherenson, has accused the group of dishonest '[[front group]]' manipulations (his group does not use the exact term '[[astroturfing]]' since it respects the trademark). The vice chairperson of [[PhRMA]] has disputed the allegation and referred to the campaign as completely "transparent".<ref name=summer>{{citenews|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26312.html|publisher=[[The Politico]]|date=2009-08-21|author=[[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]]|accessdate=2009-08-26|title=The Summer of AstroTurf}}</ref>
