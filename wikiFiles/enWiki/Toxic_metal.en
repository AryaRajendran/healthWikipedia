'''Toxic metals''' are [[metal]]s that form [[poison]]ous soluble compounds and have no biological role, i.e. are not essential minerals, or are in the wrong form.<ref>[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~toxmetal/TX.shtml Dartmouth Toxic Metal Research - Toxic Metals!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Often [[heavy metals]] are thought as synonymous, but lighter metals also have toxicity, such as [[beryllium]], and not all heavy metals are particularly toxic, and some are essential, such as [[iron]]. The definition may also include [[trace element]]s when considered in abnormally high, toxic doses. A difference is that there is no beneficial dose for a toxic metal with no biological role.

Toxic metals sometimes imitate the action of an essential element in the body, interfering with the metabolic process to cause [[illness]]. Many metals, particularly [[heavy metals]] are toxic, but some heavy metals are essential, and some, such as [[bismuth]], have a low toxicity.  Most often the definition <!-- of what??--> includes at least [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and the radioactive metals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  [[Metalloid]]s ([[arsenic]], [[polonium]]) may be included in the definition. Radioactive metals have both [[Radiation poisoning|radiological toxicity]] and chemical toxicity. Metals in an oxidation state abnormal to the body may also become toxic: [[chromium]](III) is an essential trace element, but chromium(VI) is a [[carcinogen]]. 

Toxicity is a function of solubility.  Insoluble compounds as well as the metallic forms often exhibit negligible toxicity. The toxicity of any metal depends on its [[ligands]]. In some cases, organometallic forms, such as [[dimethyl mercury]] and [[tetraethyl lead]], can be extremely toxic. In other cases, organometallic derivatives are less toxic such as the [[cobaltocenium]] cation.

Decontamination for toxic metals is different from organic toxins: because toxic metals are elements, they cannot be destroyed. Toxic metals may be made insoluble or collected, possibly by the aid of chelating agents. Alternatively, they can be diluted into a sufficiently large reservoir, such as the sea, because immediate toxicity is function of concentration rather than amount. However, bioaccumulation has the potential to reverse this.

Toxic metals can [[bioaccumulate]] in the body and in the [[food chain]]. Therefore, a common characteristic of toxic metals is the chronic nature of their toxicity. This is particularly notable with radioactive heavy metals such as [[radium]], which imitates [[calcium]] to the point of being incorporated into human bone, although similar health implications are found in [[Lead poisoning|lead]] or [[mercury poisoning]]. The exceptions to this are [[barium]] and [[aluminium]], which can be removed efficiently by the kidneys.

==Toxic heavy  metals==
*[[Antimony]] (a [[metalloid]])
*[[Arsenic]] (see [[arsenic poisoning]]) is a [[metalloid]]
*[[Barium]]
*[[Beryllium]]
*[[Cadmium]] - [[cadmium poisoning]]
*[[Lead]] - [[lead poisoning]]
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] - [[mercury poisoning]]
*[[Osmium]]
*[[Thallium]]
*[[Vanadium]]
*[[Radioactive]] metals:
**[[Actinium]]
**[[Thorium]]
**[[Uranium]]
**[[Radium]]
**The [[transuranium]]s, such as [[plutonium]], [[americium]], etc.
**[[Polonium]]
**Radioactive isotopes of metallic elements not otherwise strongly toxic, e.g. [[cobalt-60]] and [[strontium-90]].

[[Aluminium]] has no known biological role and its classification into toxic metals is controversial. Significant toxic effects and accumulation to tissues have been observed in renally impaired patients.<ref>[http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijne/vol2n2/aluminum.xml Acute Aluminum Neurotoxicity Secondary To Treatment Of Severe Hyperphosphatemia Of Acute Renal Failure And The K/DOQI Guidelines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, individuals with healthy kidneys can be exposed to large amounts of aluminium with no ill effects. Thus, aluminium is not considered dangerous to persons with normal elimination capacity.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic113.htm eMedicine - Toxicity, Aluminum : Article by Michael R Edwards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Vanadium]] poisoning is notable as it is an anti-corrosive component of automotive steel, fragments of which can be left in passengers during an automobile accident.

In cases of metal toxicity - especially from mercury via amalgam fillings and vaccines - chelation is seeing increasing therapeutic use. Perhaps the most-used method is the  "Cutler Protocol", which uses constant doses of oral chelator only, and emphasises its conservatism and safety.

==Trace elements with toxicity==
*[[Chromium]] as hexavalent Cr(VI)
*[[Nickel]] – nickel salts are carcinogenic
*[[Copper]] – [[copper toxicity]]
*[[Zinc]] - [[zinc toxicity]]
*[[Iron]] – [[iron poisoning]]

==Nonmetals==
Some heavy nonmetals may be erroneously called "metals", because they have some metallic properties.
*[[Selenium]] – a [[nonmetal]]; essential element
*[[Tellurium]]
