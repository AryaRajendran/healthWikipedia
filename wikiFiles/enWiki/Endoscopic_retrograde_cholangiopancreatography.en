'''Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography''' ('''ERCP''') is a technique that combines the use of [[endoscopy]] and [[fluoroscopy]] to diagnose and treat certain problems of the [[bile duct|biliary]] or [[pancreatic duct]]al systems. Through the endoscope, the physician can see the inside of the [[stomach]] and [[duodenum]], and inject radiographic contrast into the ducts in the biliary tree and [[pancreas]] so they can be seen on X-rays. 

ERCP is used primarily to diagnose and treat conditions of the bile ducts and main pancreatic duct,<ref>Adler DG, Baron TH, Davila RE, Egan J, Hirota WK, Leighton JA, Qureshi W, Rajan E, Zuckerman MJ, Fanelli R, Wheeler-Harbaugh J, Faigel DO; Standards of Practice Committee of American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. ASGE guideline: the role of ERCP in diseases of the biliary tract and the pancreas.Gastrointest Endosc. 2005 Jul;62(1):1-8.</ref> including [[gallstones]], inflammatory strictures (scars), leaks (from trauma and surgery), and cancer. 
ERCP can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons, although the development of safer and relatively non-invasive investigations such as [[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] (MRCP) and [[endoscopic ultrasound]] has meant that ERCP is now rarely performed without therapeutic intent.

==Diagnostic==

*[[Obstructive jaundice]] - This may be due to several causes
*Chronic [[pancreatitis]] - a now controversial indication due to widespread availability of safer diagnostic modalities including [[endoscopic ultrasound]], high-resolution [[CT scan|CT]], and [[MRI]]/[[Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography|MRCP]]
*Gallstones with dilated bile ducts on [[ultrasonography]]
*[[Bile duct tumor]]s
*Suspected injury to bile ducts either as a result of trauma or [[iatrogenic]]
*[[Sphincter of Oddi|Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction]]
*[[Pancreatic cancer|Pancreatic tumors]] no longer represent a valid diagnostic indication for ERCP unless they cause bile duct obstruction and jaundice. Endoscopic ultrasound represents a safer and more accurate diagnostic alternative

==Therapeutic==
*Any of the above when the following may become necessary
**Endoscopic [[sphincterotomy]] (both of the biliary and the pancreatic sphincters)
**Removal of stones
**Insertion of stent(s)
**Dilation of strictures (e.g. [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], anastomotic strictures after liver transplantation)

==Contraindications==
* Acute pancreatitis (unless persistently raised or worsening bilirubin suggests ongoing obstruction)
*Pancreatic pseudocyst
*Previous pancreatoduodenectomy
*Coagulation disorder
* Recent [[myocardial infarction]]
* Inadequate surgical back-up
* History of contrast dye [[anaphylaxis]]
* Poor health condition for surgery
* Severe [[cardiopulmonary]] disease

==Procedure==
The patient is sedated or anaesthetized.  Then a flexible camera ([[endoscope]]) is inserted through the mouth, down the esophagus, into the stomach, through the [[pylorus]] into the [[duodenum]] where the [[ampulla of Vater]] (the opening of the common [[bile duct]] and pancreatic duct) exists.  The [[sphincter of Oddi]] is a muscular valve that controls the opening of the ampulla. The region can be directly visualized with the endoscopic camera while various procedures are performed.  A plastic catheter or ''[[Wikt:cannula|cannula]]'' is inserted through the ampulla, and radiocontrast is injected into the bile ducts and/or pancreatic duct. [[Fluoroscopy]] is used to look for blockages, or other lesions such as stones.

When needed, the opening of the ampulla can be enlarged ([[sphincterotomy]]) with an electrified wire ([[sphincterotome]]) and access into the bile duct obtained so that [[gallstones]] may be removed or other therapy performed.

Other procedures associated with ERCP include the trawling of the common bile duct with a basket or balloon to remove [[gallstones]] and the insertion of a plastic [[stent]] to assist the drainage of bile. Also, the pancreatic duct can be cannulated and stents be inserted. The pancreatic duct requires visualisation in cases of pancreatitis.

In specific cases, a second camera can be inserted through the channel of the first endoscope.  This is termed duodenoscope-assisted cholangiopancreatoscopy (DACP) or mother-daughter ERCP.  The daughter scope can be used to administer direct electrohydraulic lithotripsy to break up stones, or to help in diagnosis by directly visualizing the duct (as opposed to obtaining X-ray images).<ref name="pmid15933927">{{cite journal |author=Farrell JJ, Bounds BC, Al-Shalabi S, Jacobson BC, Brugge WR, Schapiro RH, Kelsey PB |title=Single-operator duodenoscope-assisted cholangioscopy is an effective alternative in the management of choledocholithiasis not removed by conventional methods, including mechanical lithotripsy |journal=Endoscopy |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=542–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15933927 |doi=10.1055/s-2005-861306}}</ref> 

The gallbladder should be surgically removed ([[cholecystectomy]]) following successful removal of [[gallstones]] from the bile ducts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McAlister VC, Davenport E, Renouf E |title=Cholecystectomy deferral in patients with endoscopic sphincterotomy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD006233 |year=2007 |pmid=17943900 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006233.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006233/frame.html |editor1-last=McAlister |editor1-first=Vivian}}</ref>

==Risks==
The major risk of an ERCP is the development of [[pancreatitis]], which can occur in up to 5% of all procedures.  This may be self limited and mild, but may require hospitalization, and rarely, may be life-threatening.  Patients at additional risk for pancreatitis are younger patients, patients with previous post-ERCP pancreatitis, females, procedures that involve cannulation or injection of the pancreatic duct, and patients with [[sphincter of Oddi]] dysfunction.<ref name="pmid17509029">{{cite journal |author=Andriulli A, Loperfido S, Napolitano G, Niro G, Valvano MR, Spirito F, Pilotto A, Forlano R |title=Incidence rates of post-ERCP complications: a systematic survey of prospective studies |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=102 |issue=8 |pages=1781–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17509029 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01279.x}}</ref>

Gut perforation is a risk of any endoscopic procedure, and is an additional risk if a sphincterotomy is performed.  As the second part of the duodenum is anatomically in a retroperitoneal location (that is, behind the peritoneal structures of the abdomen), perforations due to sphincterotomies are also retroperitoneal.  Sphincterotomy is also associated with a risk of bleeding.<ref name="pmid17509029"/>

Oversedation can result in dangerously low blood pressure, respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting.

There is also a risk associated with the contrast dye in patients who are allergic to compounds containing iodine.

Other complications (less than 1 per 100) may include; heart and lung problems, bleeding after [[sphincterotomy]], infection in the bile duct ([[cholangitis]]) and perforation (a tear in the intestine). In some rare cases, ERCP can even cause fatal complications.<ref>http://www.ddc.musc.edu/public/testsProcedures/procedures/ERCP.cfm</ref>
