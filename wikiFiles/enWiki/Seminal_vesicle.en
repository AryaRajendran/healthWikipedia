They are located within the [[pelvis]].

==Anatomy==
Each seminal vesicle spans approximately 5&nbsp;cm, though its full unfolded length is approximately 10&nbsp;cm, but it is curled up inside the gland's structure. Each vesicle forms as an outpocketing of the wall of the [[Ampulla_of_ductus_deferens|ampulla]] of one [[vas deferens]].

The [[excretory duct of seminal gland|excretory duct]] of each seminal gland opens into the vas deferens as it enters the [[prostate gland]].

==Function==
The seminal vesicles secrete a significant proportion of the fluid that ultimately becomes [[semen]]. [[Lipofuscin]] granules from dead [[epithelial cell]]s give the secretion its yellowish color.  About 50-70%<ref name=kierszenbaum558>{{cite book|last=Kierszenbaum|first=Abraham L.|title=Histology and cell biology : an introduction to pathology|year=2002|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis [u.a.]|isbn=0-323-01639-1|pages=558}}</ref> of the seminal fluid in humans originates from the seminal vesicles, but is not expelled in the first [[ejaculation|ejaculate]] fractions which are dominated by [[spermatozoa]] and zinc-rich [[Prostate#Function|prostatic fluid]]. The excretory duct of each seminal gland opens into the corresponding vas deferens as it enters the prostate gland.
Seminal vesicle fluid is [[alkaline]], resulting in human semen having a mildly alkaline [[pH]].<ref>

The alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the acidity of the vaginal tract{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. Acidic ejaculate (pH <7.2) may be associated with [[Ejaculatory duct obstruction]]. The vesicle produces a substance that causes the semen to become sticky/jelly-like after ejaculation, which is thought to be useful in keeping the semen near the womb.

The thick secretions from the seminal vesicles contain [[protein]]s, [[enzyme]]s, [[fructose]], [[mucus]], [[vitamin C]], [[Flavin group|flavins]], [[phosphorylcholine]] and [[prostaglandin]]s. The high fructose concentrations provide nutrient energy for the [[spermatozoa]] when stored in semen in the laboratory. Spermatozoa ejaculated into the vagina are not likely to have contact with the seminal vesicular fluid but transfer directly from the prostatic fluid into the [[cervical mucus]] as the first step on their travel through the [[female reproductive system]]. The fluid is expelled under [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] contraction of the muscularis muscle coat.

In vitro studies have shown that [[sperm]] expelled together with seminal vesicular fluid show poor motility and survival, and the sperm chromatin is less protected. Therefore the exact physiological importance of seminal vesicular fluid is not clear. It has been speculated that it is a developmental rest, still seen among some rodents where the last part of the ejaculate form a [[spermicidal]] plug which reduces the chances for sperm from a later arriving male to proceed to the oocyte.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Histologically]], the seminal vesicles are notable for their tortuous pathways, [[diverticula]], pseudo-stratified columnar [[epithelium]] and [[cuboidal cells]] along the basal layer.
[[Image:Seminal_vesicles_and_rectum.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Seminal vesicles]]
The height of these columnar cells, and therefore activity, is dependent upon [[testosterone]] levels in the blood.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] is large and stores the fluid secretions (but '''not''' spermatozoa) between [[ejaculation]]s.

From inside to out, the layers are:
* [[Mucosa]] - arranged into convoluted folds, significantly increasing surface area
* Muscular - well-developed layer composed of an inner circular and outer longitudinal layer of [[smooth muscle]]
* [[Connective tissue]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
