'''Antonín Heveroch''' (19 January 1869 – 2 March 1927) was a Czech [[psychiatrist]] and [[neurologist]]. After working at the [[Psychiatric Clinic in Prague]], he left it and established a second psychiatric hospital.

==Early years==
Heveroch was born in 1869 in Minice, a neighbourhood of [[Kralupy nad Vltavou]]. His father, František Heveroch (1843–1923), was a [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] and choir director.<ref name="Macek">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskyhudebnislovnik.cz/slovnik/index.php?option=com_mdictionary&action=record_detail&id=7546|title=Heveroch, Antonín|last=Macek|first=Petr  |publisher=Department of Musicology at Masaryk University Faculty of Arts|language=Czech|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> He attended elementary school in [[Vepřek (town)|Vepřek]] and [[Zlonice]], and grammar school in [[Slaný]].<ref name="veprek.cz">{{cite web|url=http://www.veprek.cz/rodaci.html|title=Rodáci a osobnosti spojené s Vepřkem|language=Czech|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> He initially studied at [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]] Faculty of Law, however, in 1889, he switched to the Faculty of Medicine, graduating in 1894. He was a student of [[Karel Kuffner]]. In 1899, he was studying psychiatry and neurology.

==Career==
In 1906, he was appointed an Associate Professor at Charles University.  In 1908, he established and led the ''Institute for Epileptics'' in Prague-[[Libeň]] (Valentinum).  
Heveroch was the head of the psychiatric department of a [[garrison]] hospital in Prague; in 1915, he was privy to a secret resistance organization, but in August 1917, he was sent to the Russian front.<ref name="veprek.cz" /> At the beginning of the 20th century, doctors in the field of psychiatry and neurology wanted to form their own organization. The Purkyn Association for the Study of the Mind and Nervous System formed on October 18, 1919; its first chairman was Heveroch.<ref name="wpanet.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.wpanet.org/detail.php?section_id=5&content_id=221|title=Czech Psychiatric Society|publisher=World Psychiatric Association|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> In the same  year, he became the director of the ''Prague Insane Asylum''. He obtained full professorship in 1921. He was a member of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and Arts, Academy of Labour and the State Medical Board. He was also Vice President of the Society of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]] (he let the actors study examples of [[psychosis]] in his department for some of their roles). Heveroch was associated with the Psychiatric Clinic in Prague, but never became its leader; instead he left in 1904, and in 1924, established a second psychiatric hospital, which closed three years after he died.<ref name="psychiatrie.lf1.cuni.cz">{{cite web|url=http://psychiatrie.lf1.cuni.cz/en/history-of-the-psychiatric-clinic-in-prague|title=History of the Psychiatric Clinic in Prague|date=March 31, 2007|publisher=Department of Psychiatry, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>

He also studied psychology and psychiatry of [[everyday life]] and tirelessly popularized psychiatry among laymen. His name thus became famous enough to become popular as a synonym for a psychiatrist.; and so, people used to say, "we'll call Heveroch [a psychiatrist] on you", similarly as they later used the names of Mysliveček or [[Vladimír Vondráček|Vondráček]] for the same purpose. ''"Pinel is said to be the one who removed the [[shackles]] from the mentally ill, Heveroch has [in Bohemia] opened the prison of psychiatry and let it get outside of the walls."''<ref>Vondráček, V. (1959): ''Devadesát let od narození Antonína Heverocha'', In: Československá psychiatrie, p. 189 {{cs icon}}</ref> In his medical research, he frequently applied the therapeutic principles of [[psychotherapy]] (psychagogic, [[persuasion]]), but he did not use [[hypnosis]] and harshly rejected [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] [[psychoanalysis]]. However, he acknowledged the existence of the [[subconscious]]. From a philosophical point of view he was close to [[vitalism]]. He refused [[psychophysical parallelism]]. His direct pupils were [[Vladimír Vondráček]] (1895–1978) and Otakar Janota (1898–1969). He himself was a pupil of Josef Thomayer (1853–1927). Vondráček described him as a respectable man, gentle, sober, with a focus on [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], with a sense of humor, as an excellent speaker, trainer, organizer and debater. ''"He was extremely tidy. He was a man "adjusted to the vertical", which means that the pens on his desk were carefully and vertically sorted (...) He walked quickly, often with his hands folded on his back, with his head tilted to the side."''<ref>Vondráček, V. (1977): ''Před 50 lety zemřel profesor Heveroch'', In: Časopis lékařů českých, p. 280 {{cs icon}}</ref> 

In more than 100 original works and articles, he devoted himself to various topics: [[aphasia]] and [[agnosia]], the awareness of our own existence, the rhythm of life and its defects, the [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], loss of awareness of our feelings, the [[self-reference]] and [[causality]], the [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]], [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination]]s, [[Syncope (medicine)|faint]] states, the soul of a crowd, "children pathologically lying", the [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|restless children]], and crime associated with school children, among other things. His book ''Diagnostika chorob duševních''<ref name="Sígl2007">{{cite book|last=Sígl|first=Miroslav|title=Kdo byl a je kdo: Mělnicko, Kralupsko, Neratovicko : osobnosti, samospráva, historie|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PTgiAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=15 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=Nakl. Libri|isbn=978-80-7277-351-0|page=138}}</ref> (Diagnosis of Mental Diseases, 1904) became the basic textbook of the Czechoslovak psychiatry, together with the book ''Psychiatrie'' (Psychiatry, 1897) by Kuffner (1858–1940). His essay ''O podivínech a lidech nápadných''<ref name="Sígl2007" /> (On Freaks and Striking People, 1901) vividly depicts portraits of patients suffering (from today's perspective) from [[psychopathy]] or [[personality disorder]]. This book allegedly inspired [[Jaroslav Hašek]] when writing his [[Schweik]]. His work is pioneering and many of his ideas are still valid today. For example, in the six-part series called ''O poruchách jáství'' (On the Disorders of the [[Self]], 1910), he was the first in [[Bohemia]] to cover the phenomenon of [[depersonalization]] (although he didn't use this designation).

==Personal life==
He was married to Kamila Heverochová,<ref name="Daneš2010">{{cite journal|last=Daneš|first=David |date=March 31, 2010|title=Sbírka grafiky a kresby představuje nový grafický kabinet ve Veletržním paláci – Na účetním lístku|journal=zaKulturou|language=Czech|url=http://www.zakulturou.cz/vystavy/sbirka-grafiky-a-kresby-predstavuje-novy-graficky-kabinet-ve-veletrznim-palaci---na-ucetnim-listku.html}}</ref> but died childless on 2 March 1927 in [[Prague]]. He is buried at the [[Vinohrady]] Cemetery in Prague; his grave is decorated with his bust made by his friend, the sculptor [[Jaroslav Horejc]] (1886–1983).
