==Species and strains==

Until recently,  only three genospecies were thought to cause Lyme disease (borreliosis): ''B. burgdorferi'' [[sensu stricto]] (the predominant species in [[North America]], but also present in [[Europe]]); ''B. afzelii''; and ''B. garinii'' (both predominant in [[Eurasia]]). Totally 10 complete [[genome]]s of ''B. burgdorferi'' sensu stricto, ''B. afzelii'' and ''B. garinii'' strains are available on [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] Genome server at Feb 2013. ''B. burgdorferi'' strain B31 was derived by limited dilutional cloning from the original Lyme-disease tick isolate derived by [[Alan Barbour]].

Lyme disease is most endemic in [[Northern Hemisphere]] temperate regions.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Grubhoffer L, Golovchenko M, Vancova M, Zacharovova-Slavickova K, Rudenko N, Oliver JH Jr. | title=Lyme borreliosis: insights into tick-/host-''borrelia'' relations | journal=Folia Parasitol (Praha) | year=2005 | month=November | volume=52 | issue=4 (Review) | pages=279–294 | pmid=16405291}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Higgins R | title=Emerging or re-emerging bacterial zoonotic diseases: bartonellosis, leptospirosis, Lyme borreliosis, plague | journal=Rev Sci Tech. | year=2004 | month=August | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=569–581 | pmid=15702720}}</ref>  However, sporadic cases of Lyme disease have been described in other areas of the world.

The number of reported cases of the borreliosis have been increasing, as are endemic regions in [[North America]]. Of cases reported to the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the rate of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/ld_UpClimbLymeDis.htm |title=DVBID: Disease Upward Climb – CDC Lyme Disease |accessdate=2007-08-23 |date = 2006-10-02}}</ref> Although Lyme disease has now been reported in 49 of 50 states in the U.S (all but Hawaii), about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas ([[New England]], Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/ld_statistics.htm |title=Lyme Disease Statistics | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |accessdate=2007-08-23 |date = 2007-04-02}}</ref>

==Life cycle==
{{further|Tick#Life cycle}}

The life cycle of ''B. burgdorferi'' is complex, requiring [[tick]]s, [[rodents]], and [[deer]] at various points. [[mouse|Mice]] are the primary [[Vector (epidemiology)|reservoir]] for the bacteria; [[tick|''Ixodes'' ticks]] then transmit the ''B. burgdorferi'' [[infection]] to deer.

Hard ticks have a variety of [[Biological life cycle|life histories]] with respect to optimizing their chance of contact with an appropriate host to ensure survival. The life stages of soft ticks are not readily distinguishable. The first life stage to hatch from the egg, a six-legged larva, takes a blood meal from a host, and molts to the first nymphal stage. Unlike hard ticks, many soft ticks go through multiple [[nymph]]al stages, gradually increasing in size until the final molt to the adult stage. 

The life cycle of the deer tick comprises three growth stages: the [[larva]], [[nymph]] and adult. 

The life-cycle concept encompassing [[Natural reservoir|reservoirs]] and infections in multiple hosts has recently been expanded to encompass forms of the [[spirochete]] which differ from the motile corkscrew form, and these include cystic [[spheroplast|spheroplast-like]] forms, straight non-coiled bacillary forms which are immotile [[flagellin|due to flagellin mutations]] and granular forms, [[Coccus|coccoid in profile]]. The model of ''Plasmodium'' species [[malaria]], with multiple parasitic profiles demonstrable in various host insects and mammals, is a hypothesized model for a similarly complex proposed ''Borrelia'' spirochete life cycle.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Macdonald AB | title=A life cycle for ''Borrelia'' spirochetes? | journal=Med Hypotheses | year=2006 | volume=67 | issue=4 | pages=810–8 | pmid=16716532 | doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.03.028}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Lymeinfo.net — LDAdverseConditions | url=http://www.lymeinfo.net/medical/LDAdverseConditions.pdf | year=2006|format=PDF}}</ref>

Whereas ''B. burgdorferi'' is most associated with [[Ixodes|deer tick]] and the white footed mouse,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Wallis RC, Brown SE, Kloter KO, Main AJ Jr. | title=''Erythema chronicum migrans'' and Lyme arthritis: field study of ticks | journal=Am J Epidemiol. | year=1978 | month=October | volume=108 | issue=4 | pages=322–7 | pmid=727201}}</ref> ''B. afzelli'' is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and ''B. garinii'' and ''B. valaisiana'' appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' sensu stricto. The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative immune [[complement system]] of various host species may determine its reservoir host association.

==Novel Antibiotics==

[[Borrelidin]] is an antibiotic that has remarkable selectivity against Borrelia species. It inhibits [[threonyl-tRNA synthetase]], with a much higher affinity for Borrelia versus mammalian hosts. For reasons not fully understood, it is quite toxic.


==Genomic characteristics==
The genome of ''B.&nbsp;burgdorferi'' (B31 strain) was the third microbial genome ever to be sequenced, following the sequencing of both ''H. influenzae'' and ''M. genitalium'' in 1995, and its chromosome contains 910,725 base pairs and 853 genes.<ref name="nature1997">{{cite journal | author=Fraser, Claire M.| title=Genomic sequence of a Lyme disease spirochaete, ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' | journal=Nature | volume=390 | issue=6660 | pages=580–6 | year=1997 | doi=10.1038/37551 | pmid=9403685 | last2=Casjens | first2=S | last3=Huang | first3=WM | last4=Sutton | first4=GG | last5=Clayton | first5=R | last6=Lathigra | first6=R | last7=White | first7=O | last8=Ketchum | first8=KA | last9=Dodson | first9=R }}</ref>

Like other spirochetes, such as ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' (the agent of [[syphilis]]), ''B. burgdorferi'' has an axial filament composed of [[flagella]] which run lengthways between its cell wall and outer membrane. This structure allows the spirochete to move efficiently in corkscrew fashion through [[viscous]] media, such as [[connective tissue]].

''B. burgdorferi'' is very slow growing, with a doubling time of 12–18 hours<ref>{{cite book | author=Kelly, RT | year=1984 | title=Genus IV.

Since most [[antibiotics]] kill bacteria only when they are dividing, this longer doubling time necessitates the use of relatively longer treatment courses for Lyme disease.

==Outer surface proteins==
The outer membrane of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' is composed of various unique outer surface [[lipoproteins|proteins]] (Osp) that have been characterized (OspA through OspF). The Osp proteins are [[lipoproteins]] anchored by N-terminally attached fatty acid molecules to the membrane.<ref name="pmid10878114">{{cite journal |author=Haake DA |title=Spirochaetal lipoproteins and pathogenesis |journal=Microbiology (Reading, Engl.) |volume=146 |issue= 7|pages=1491–1504 |year=2000 |pmid=10878114 |pmc=2664406}}</ref>  They are presumed to play a role in virulence, transmission, or survival in the tick. 

OspA, OspB, and OspD are expressed by ''B. burgdorferi'' residing in the gut of unfed ticks, suggesting they promote the persistence of the spirochete in ticks between blood meals.<ref name="pmid7708747">{{cite journal |author=Schwan TG, Piesman J, Golde WT, Dolan MC, Rosa PA |title=Induction of an outer surface protein on ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' during tick feeding |journal=Proc.

*[[Immune system]] suppression.

Recent studies in both acute and antibiotic refractory, or chronic, Lyme disease have shown a distinct [[inflammation|pro-inflammatory]] immune process. This pro-inflammatory process is a [[cell-mediated immunity]] and results in Th1 upregulation. These studies have shown a significant decrease in [[cytokine]] output of (IL-10), an upregulation of [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6) and [[interleukin-12]] (Il-12) and [[interferon-gamma]] (IFN-gamma) and dysregulation in [[TNF-alpha]],` predominantly.

New research has also found chronic Lyme patients have higher amounts of ''Borrelia''-specific [[FoxP3|forkhead box P3]] (FoxP3) than healthy controls, indicating [[regulatory T cell]]s might also play a role, by [[immunosuppression]], in the development of chronic Lyme disease. FoxP3 are a specific marker of regulatory T cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jarefors S, Janefjord CK, Forsberg P, Jenmalm MC, Ekerfelt C | title=Decreased up-regulation of the interleukin-12Rbeta2-chain and interferon-gamma secretion and increased number of forkhead box P3-expressing cells in patients with a history of chronic Lyme borreliosis compared with asymptomatic ''Borrelia''-exposed individuals | journal=Clin Exp Immunol. | year=2007 | month=January | volume=147 | issue=1 | pages=18–27 | pmid=17177959 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03245.x | pmc=1810439}}</ref> The signaling pathway [[P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases]] (p38 MAP kinase) has also been identified as promoting expression of proinflammatory cytokines from borrelia.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Olson CM, Hedrick MN, Izadi H, Bates TC, Olivera ER, Anguita J | title=p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase controls NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and tumor necrosis factor alpha production through RelA phosphorylation mediated by mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 in response to ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' antigens | journal=Infect Immun. | year=2007 | month=January | volume=75 | issue=1 | pages=270–277 | date=2006-10-30 | pmid=17074860 | doi=10.1128/IAI.01412-06 | pmc=1828394}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Ramesh G, Philipp MT | title=Pathogenesis of Lyme neuroborreliosis: mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1, Erk2, and p38 in the response of astrocytes to ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' lipoproteins | journal=Neurosci Lett. | date=2005 August 12–19 | volume=384 | issue=1–2 | pages=112–116 | doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2005.04.069 | pmid=15893422}}</ref>

The culmination of these new and ongoing immunological studies suggest this cell-mediated immune disruption in the Lyme patient amplifies the inflammatory process, often rendering it chronic and self-perpetuating, regardless of whether the ''Borrelia'' bacterium is still present in the host, or in the absence of the inciting pathogen in an [[autoimmune]] pattern.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singh SK, Girschick HJ |title=Toll-like receptors in ''Borrelia burgdorferi''-induced inflammation |journal=Clin.

==Vaccines==
Due to its universal and high level expression, outer surface protein A (OspA) was the natural focus of early vaccine development efforts.  An OspA-based vaccine (LYMErix; [[SmithKline Beecham]]) was licensed for use in adults.  However, this vaccine was voluntarily removed from the market by its manufacturer in 2002.  Recently, considerable progress in the development of broadly protective Lyme disease vaccines has been made.  In particular, there is a focus on alternative vaccine candidates that may require fewer boosts and will conceivably provide long term protection. There is interest in developing vaccines that specifically target the tick vectors of Lyme disease, specifically components of tick saliva that coat the bacteria. This approach offers the advantage of protecting against multiple pathogens with one vaccine.<ref>"Tick saliva." The Science Teacher 77.1 (2010): 14.</ref>  While an effective Lyme disease vaccine seems likely to be developed, earlier experiences with the LYMErix vaccine suggest that bringing such a vaccine to market will be a challenge.<ref name= Marconi2010>{{cite book |author= Marconi, RT; Earnhart, CG| year=2010 |chapter=Lyme Disease Vaccines|title=''Borrelia'': Molecular Biology, Host Interaction and Pathogenesis | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-58-5}}</ref>

A vaccine made by [[Pfizer]] known as LymeVax is currently available for use in dogs. Having dogs vaccinated should also help to protect their owners from infection by the dog. It is a 2-strain, multi-antigen vaccine which induces an antibody response to bacterial proteins OspA and OspC.<ref name= LymeVax>{{cite web |url= https://animalhealth.pfizer.com/sites/pahweb/US/EN/Products/Pages/LymeVax.aspx |title= LymeVax |work= Product page |publisher= Pfizer |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>
