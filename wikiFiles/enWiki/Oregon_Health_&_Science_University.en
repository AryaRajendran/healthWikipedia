'''Oregon Health & Science University''' ('''OHSU''') is a public [[university]] in [[Oregon]] with a main campus, including two [[hospital]]s, in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and a smaller campus in [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]].  It was formed in 1974 as the '''University of Oregon Health Sciences Center''', combining state [[dentistry]], [[medicine]], and [[nursing]] programs into a single center.  

It was renamed '''Oregon Health Sciences University''' in 1981 and took its current name in 2001, as part of a merger with the [[Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology]] (OGI), in Hillsboro. In addition, the university has several partnership programs including a joint [[PharmD]] [[Pharmacy]] program with [[Oregon State University]].

==History==
The [[Willamette University School of Medicine]], OHSU's earliest predecessor, was founded in the 1860s in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], and was relocated to Portland in the 1870s.<ref>[http://www.ohsu.edu/about/history.html OHSU: An historical chronology]</ref> In 1915, [[Willamette University]] and the [[University of Oregon]] merged their medical programs to form the University of Oregon Medical School, and in 1919 the school moved to its present location on [[Marquam Hill]] in Southwest Portland.  The Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company donated {{convert|20|acre|ha}} and [[Charles Samuel Jackson|C.S. "Sam" Jackson]], publisher of the now-defunct ''[[Oregon Journal]]'' donated the remaining {{convert|88|acre|ha}} to the school two years prior to the move after the property had been deemed unsuitable for the construction of a [[railroad yard]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/facts/history.cfm|publisher=Oregon Health & Science University|accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>.  

Over the next forty years, the school diversified its educational offerings to include nursing and dental programs,<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Virgil|title=Dental School Goal Finally Reached|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 17, 1945|page=50}}</ref> and expanded its operation in connection with medical facilities built during this time on Marquam Hill, including the Multnomah County Hospital, the Doernbecher Memorial Hospital for Children, and an outpatient clinic.  

In 1955, Oregon state Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] co-sponsored a bill to transform the medical school into a teaching hospital, and in 1974 the State of Oregon merged the institutions located on Marquam Hill into the University Hospital independent of the University of Oregon.  Hatfield's continued support of medical research in Oregon in general and the hospital in particular throughout his political career and later as an OHSU Board Member was recognized by the institution in 1998 with the dedication of the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center and the creation of the Hatfield information wall on permanent display in the lobby of the main hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sen. Mark O. Hatfield Information Wall|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/news_events/news/2011/hatfield-wall.cfm|publisher=Oregon Health & Science University|accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>  In 2008, [[Ted Kulongoski|Governor Kulongoski]] released an executive order designating the Mark O. Hatfield Chair of the OHSU Board of Directors to commemorate Hatfield's commitment to the institution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive Order No. 08-12|url=http://www.oregon.gov/gov/docs/executive_orders/eo0812.pdf|publisher=Office of the Governor.

On October 29, 2008, OHSU announced its largest philanthropic gift to date: a $100 million gift from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] co-founder [[Phil Knight]] and his wife [[Penny Knight]]. The gift went to the [[OHSU Cancer Institute]], renaming it the [[Knight Cancer Institute|OHSU Knight Cancer Institute]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Korn|first=Peter|title=Knights’ $100 million gift boosts OHSU cancer fight |date=October 29, 2008|newspaper=[[Portland Tribune]]|url=http://thetribonline.com/news/story.php?story_id=122530766526944700 |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Aerial tram===
{{Main|Portland Aerial Tram}} 
In 2001, OHSU purchased property in what is now known as the [[South Waterfront]] neighborhood with intentions to expand its facilities there.  After the purchase, OHSU began developing plans with the Portland Office of Transportation to connect this location to its Marquam Hill facilities by way of an [[aerial tram]].  Before construction of the tram began in 2005, the project was criticized by residents in the neighborhoods located directly below the projected tram route who believed its construction would result in an invasion of privacy and lower property values.  The group No Tram to OHSU argued that OHSU had not sufficiently justified the benefits of the tram, that the tram would not alleviate [[traffic congestion]] on Marquam Hill as OHSU claimed, and that the project inappropriately made use of public right of way for private purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Tram|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010714212825/http://www.notram.org/faq.htm|publisher=No Tram to OHSU|accessdate=28 April 2013|archiveurl=http://archive.org/web/web.php|archivedate=July 14, 2001|date=January 19, 2001}}</ref> During the construction phase, the project came under additional public scrutiny amid rising construction and operation costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tram ride could set you back $4|url=http://www.katu.com/news/5138496.html|publisher=KATU.com|coauthors=Brian Barker and KATU Web Staff|date=Jan 9, 2007. Updated Apr 14, 2009}}</ref>        

===PETA===
In 2006, the animal rights group [[PETA]] incited some controversy over OHSU research involving sheep.<ref>{{cite web | title = Oregon gay sheep experiment challenged by tennis champ | publisher = Associated Press | work = KGW.com | date = November 5, 2006 | url = http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/110506cckkKGWgaysheep.9cf26ed.html | accessdate = 2008-01-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071224090832/http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/110506cckkKGWgaysheep.9cf26ed.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-24}}</ref> The research, which is being conducted in conjunction with [[Oregon State University]] is designed to understand the biological mechanisms involved in sexual partner preference.<ref>{{cite web | first = Sandi | last = Doughton | title = Born gay?

==Campuses==
{{see also|Oregon Health & Science University Hospital}}
The main campus, located on [[Marquam Hill]] (colloquially known as "Pill Hill") in the southwest neighborhood of [[Homestead, Portland, Oregon|Homestead]], is home to the university's medical school as well as two associated hospitals.  The [[Oregon Health & Science University Hospital]] is a [[Level I trauma center]] and general hospital; [[Doernbecher Children's Hospital]] is a [[children's hospital]] which specializes in pediatric medicine and care of children with long-term illness.  The university maintains a number of outpatient primary care facilities including the Physician's Pavilion at the Marquam Hill campus as well as throughout the [[Portland metropolitan area]].

A third hospital, the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center<ref>[http://www.va.gov/portland/index.asp Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center]</ref> is located next to the main OHSU campus; this hospital is run by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] and is outside the auspices of OHSU.  A 1992 pedestrian [[bridge]] connecting OHSU Hospital and the VA Medical Center is the longest suspended pedestrian [[Skyway|skybridge]] in North America, with a length of {{convert|660|ft|m}}.
[[File:OregonHealthSciUniv.jpg|thumb|The main OHSU campus sits atop Marquam Hill]]
Additionally, the [[Portland Shriners Hospital|Portland Shriners Hospital for Children]] is located on the OHSU campus. The University also has a campus in Hillsboro, at the site of the former OGI.  This campus specializes in graduate-level science and engineering education, and is located in the heart of Oregon's [[Silicon Forest]]. Since 1998, the university has controlled the [[Oregon National Primate Research Center]], located adjacent to OGI in Hillsboro.

With the Marquam Hill campus running out of room for expansion, beginning in 2003 OHSU announced plans to expand into the [[South Waterfront|South Waterfront District]], formerly known as the North Macadam District.  The expansion area is along the [[Willamette River]] in the [[South Portland, Portland, Oregon|South Portland]] neighborhood to the east of Marquam Hill and south of [[Downtown Portland|the city center]].  The newly-constructed [[OHSU Center for Health & Healing|Center for Health & Healing]] earned [[LEED Platinum]] certification in February 2007, becoming the largest health care center in the U.S. to achieve that status. As existing surface streets were deemed insufficient to connect the two campuses, the new [[Portland Aerial Tram]] was built as the primary link between them and opened December 1, 2006. Controversy surrounded the costs of the tram,<ref>{{cite news | last = Murphy | first = Todd | title = Nice tram, who pays? | newspaper = [[Portland Tribune]] | date = October 11, 2002 | url = http://thetribonline.com/news/story.php?story_id=14099 | accessdate = April 25, 2013}}</ref> which nearly quadrupled from initial estimates. Construction of the tram was funded largely by OHSU ($40 million, 70%), with contributions from the city of Portland ($8.5 million, 15%) and developers and landowners in the South Portland neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web | title = Portland Aerial Tram FAQ | publisher = Oregon Health & Science University | url = http://www.portlandtram.org/faq.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-03}}</ref>
[[File:OHSUSouthWaterfront.jpg|thumb|Center for Health and Healing at the South Waterfront campus]]
On January 8, 2008, OHSU announced that it will establish a [[research institute]] at the Florida Center for Innovation at Tradition in the Tradition community in [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Ottolenghi | first =  Hugo | title = Oregon university to build research center in PSL, create 200 jobs for $117.9 million incentive | publisher = [[Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers]] | date = January 8, 2008 | url = http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/jan/08/oregon-university-build-research-center-psl/}}</ref> The institute eventually will employ 200 workers.  Institute scientists will study [[infectious diseases]] of the [[elderly]], [[AIDS]] and other infectious diseases and [[viruses]]. OHSU will work out of the adjacent [[Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies]] until its own center is completed. A $117.9 million financial [[incentive]] package from the state of Florida secured OHSU’s commitment.
