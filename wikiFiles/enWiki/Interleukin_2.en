'''Interleukin 2''' ('''IL-2''') is an [[interleukin]], a type of [[cytokine]] signaling molecule in the [[immune system]]. It is a protein that regulates the activities of [[white blood cell]]s (leukocytes, often [[lymphocyte]]s) that are responsible for immunity. IL-2 is part of the body's [[immune response|natural response]] to [[microbial]] [[infection]], and in discriminating between foreign ("non-self") and "self". IL-2 mediates its effects by binding to [[IL-2 receptor]]s, which are expressed by lymphocytes.

== History ==

IL-2, a soluble hormone-like mediator of the immune system, was the first interleukin molecule to be identified and characterized.<ref name="pmid6770028">{{cite journal | author = Smith KA, Lachman LB, Oppenheim JJ, Favata MF | title = The functional relationship of the interleukins | journal = J.

A soluble activity that was found mitogenic for lymphocytes was first described simultaneously by Shinpei Kasakura and Louis Lowenstein,<ref name="pmid5868897">{{cite journal | author = Kasakura S, Lowenstein L | title = A factor stimulating DNA synthesis derived from the medium of leukocyte cultures | journal = Nature | volume = 208 | issue = 5012 | pages = 794–5 | year = 1965 | month = November | pmid = 5868897 | doi = 10.1038/208794a0 }}</ref> plus [[Julius Gordon]] and Lloyd MacLean,<ref name="pmid4223737">{{cite journal | author = Gordon J, MacLean LD | title = A lymphocyte-stimulating factor produced in vitro | journal = Nature | volume = 208 | issue = 5012 | pages = 795–6 | year = 1965 | month = November | pmid = 4223737 | doi = 10.1038/208795a0 }}</ref> at [[McGill University]] in 1965 in the culture media of mixed leukocytes and named Blastogenic Factor (BF). The publication of this discovery in ''Nature'' was the first indication that the immune system might be regulated by soluble factors, other than [[immunoglobulin]]s, and galvanized the field into looking for and further characterizing these entities. Between 1965 and the mid-1970s myriad soluble "activities", each given a different name, were reported in the media conditioned by leukocytes in culture. However, the molecular nature of these "activities" remained obscure until the work of Kendall Smith and his team at Dartmouth Medical School. 

Smith's group created the first long-term antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell lines,<ref name="pmid145543">{{cite journal | author = Gillis S, Smith KA | title = Long term culture of tumour-specific cytotoxic T cells | journal = Nature | volume = 268 | issue = 5616 | pages = 154–6 | year = 1977 | month = July | pmid = 145543 | doi = 10.1038/268154a0 }}</ref> and then the first monoclonal functional T cells.<ref name="pmid310861">{{cite journal | author = Baker PE, Gillis S, Smith KA | title = Monoclonal cytolytic T-cell lines | journal = J.

Smith's group also showed TCGF to be the first cytokine to mediate its effects via a specific [[IL-2 receptor]],<ref name="pmid6975347">{{cite journal | author = Robb RJ, Munck A, Smith KA | title = T cell growth factor receptors.

It was designated the number 2 interleukin because Smith's data indicated that IL-1, produced by [[macrophages]], facilitates IL-2 production by T lymphocytes (T cells).<ref name="pmid6770028"/><ref name="pmid6776414"/> These data served as the scientific rationale for the creation of the interleukin nomenclature, anticipating that more molecules would be discovered. Now, in 2012, there are 37 interleukin molecules. 

After the biochemical biological and genetic characteristics of IL-2 became known, Shinpei Kasakura's group performed a series of experiments defining BF almost twenty years after its first description. He was able to show that BF was distinct from IL-2, B cell growth factor and IL-1.<ref name="pmid6238094">{{cite journal | author = Kasakura S, Taguchi M, Watanabe Y, Okubo T, Murachi T, Uchino H, Hanaoka M | title = A mitogenic factor, released by stimulated human mononuclear cells and distinct from interleukin 2 (IL 2), B cell growth factor (BCGF), and interleukin 1 (IL 1) | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 133 | issue = 6 | pages = 3084–90 | year = 1984 | month = December | pmid = 6238094 | doi = }}</ref> The major distinguishing characteristic was that BF was mitogenic for unstimulated lymphocytes, whereas IL-2 mitogenic activity required prior antigenic activation to stimulate the expression of IL-2Rs. Thus, BF was probably equivalent to IL-15, which was not discovered until three years later.

== Signaling pathway ==

Subsequently, IL-2 was discovered to be a member of a family of cytokines, which also includes [[Interleukin-4|IL-4]], [[Interleukin 7|IL-7]], [[Interleukin 9|IL-9]], [[Interleukin 15|IL-15]] and [[Interleukin 21|IL-21]]. IL-2 signals through a receptor complex consisting of IL-2 specific IL-2 receptor alpha ([[CD25]]), IL-2 receptor beta ([[CD122]]) and a [[common gamma chain]] (γc), which is shared by all members of this family of cytokine receptor. 

== Function ==

IL-2 is necessary for the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells to become 'effector' T cells. IL-2 is normally produced by T cells during an immune response.<ref name="pmid6427923">{{cite journal | author = Cantrell DA, Smith KA | title = The interleukin-2 T-cell system: a new cell growth model | journal = Science | volume = 224 | issue = 4655 | pages = 1312–6 | year = 1984 | month = June | pmid = 6427923 | doi = 10.1126/science.6427923 }}</ref><ref name="pmid3131876">{{cite journal | author = Smith KA | title = Interleukin-2: inception, impact, and implications | journal = Science | volume = 240 | issue = 4856 | pages = 1169–76 | year = 1988 | month = May | pmid = 3131876 | doi = 10.1126/science.3131876 }}</ref> [[Antigen]] binding to the T cell receptor ([[T cell receptor|TCR]]) stimulates the secretion of IL-2, and the expression of IL-2 receptors [[IL-2 receptor|IL-2R]].

IL-2 is also necessary during T cell development in the thymus for the maturation of a subset of T cells that are termed [[regulatory T cells]] (T-regs).<ref name="pmid7636184">{{cite journal | author = Sakaguchi S, Sakaguchi N, Asano M, Itoh M, Toda M | title = Immunologic self-tolerance maintained by activated T cells expressing IL-2 receptor alpha-chains (CD25).

T-Regs do so by preventing the responding cells from producing IL-2. Also, because T-Reg cells constitutively express IL-2 receptors, they bind, internalize and degrade IL-2, thereby depriving neighboring effector T cells of IL-2. Thus, IL-2 is required to discriminate between self and non-self, one of the other hallmarks of the immune system. 

[[interleukin-15|IL-15]] was found to be similar to IL-2.<ref name="pmid16868550">{{cite journal | author = Waldmann TA | title = The biology of interleukin-2 and interleukin-15: implications for cancer therapy and vaccine design | journal = Nat.

==Disease==
IL-2 has been linked to different diseases.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Immunotherapy==
IL-2 has been tested in many clinical trials as an [[immunotherapy]] for the treatment of cancers, chronic viral infections and as adjuvants for vaccines. 

A recombinant form of human IL-2 for clinical use is manufactured by Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. with the brand name Proleukin. It has been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of cancers (malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer) in large intermittent toxic doses, and is in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic viral infections, and as a booster (adjuvant) for vaccines. The use of large, toxic doses of IL-2 given every 6–8 weeks in HIV therapy, similar to its use in cancer therapy, has been found recently to be ineffective in preventing progression to an AIDS diagnosis in two large clinical trials.  However, that does not mean that the drug is ineffective in improving T-cell count.  Many persons who underwent IL-2 therapy enjoyed dramatic improvement in T-cell count, as well as overall health. But the FDA determined that the risks and costs (experience of side-effects) outweighed those benefits. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A recent study in which post-chemotherapy, stage IV cancer patients were given a non-toxic, lower dose of IL-2 in combination with 13-cis retinoic acid showed remarkable improvement in five-year survival rates.<ref>Recchia F, et al "Extended phase II study of maintenance immunotherapy in advanced cancer" AACR 2012; Abstract 5366 http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/AACR/32048</ref>

===IL-2 and IL-2 receptor blockade as immunosuppression===
Many of the immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and the suppression of graft rejection, such as [[corticosteroid]]s, [[cyclosporin]], and [[tacrolimus]] work by inhibiting the production of IL-2 by antigen-activated T cells. Others ([[sirolimus]]) block IL-2R signaling, thereby preventing the clonal expansion and function of antigen-selected T cells. These immunosuppressive drugs have been essential for the widespread use of organ transplants in medicine today. Without them, organs transplanted between unrelated individuals would be universally rejected.
