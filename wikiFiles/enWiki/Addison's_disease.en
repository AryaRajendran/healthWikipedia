'''Addison’s disease''' (also '''chronic [[adrenal insufficiency]]''',  '''hypocortisolism''', and '''hypoadrenalism''') is a rare, chronic [[endocrine]] disorder in which the [[adrenal gland]]s do not produce sufficient [[steroid hormone]]s ([[glucocorticoid]]s and often [[mineralocorticoid]]s). It is characterised by a number of relatively [[nonspecific symptom]]s, such as abdominal pain and weakness, but under certain circumstances, these may progress to '''Addisonian crisis''', a severe illness which may include [[shock (circulatory)|very low blood pressure]] and [[coma]].

The condition arises from problems with the adrenal gland,  "primary adrenal insufficiency", and can be caused by [[autoimmune disease|damage by the body's own immune system]], certain infections, or various rarer causes. Addison's disease is also known as chronic primary adrenocortical insufficiency, to distinguish it from acute primary adrenocortical insufficiency, most often caused by [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]]. Addison's disease should also be distinguished from secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, which are caused by deficiency of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] (produced by the [[pituitary gland]]) and [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]] (produced by the [[hypothalamus]]), respectively. Despite this distinction, Addisonian crises can happen in all forms of adrenal insufficiency.

Addison's disease and other form of hypoadrenalism are generally diagnosed via [[blood test]]s and [[medical imaging]].<ref name=Ten/> Treatment involves replacing the absent hormones (oral [[hydrocortisone]] and [[fludrocortisone]]).<ref name=AdrenalCrisis/> Lifelong, continuous steroid replacement therapy is required, with regular follow-up treatment and monitoring for other health problems.<ref name=Ten/>

Addison’s disease is named after Dr. [[Thomas Addison]], the British [[physician]] who first described the condition in 1849. The adjective "Addisonian" is used to describe features of the condition, as well as patients suffering from Addison’s disease.<ref name=Ten>{{cite journal |author=Ten S, New M, Maclaren N |title=Clinical review 130: Addison's disease 2001 |journal=J.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Addisons_hyperpigmentation.jpg|thumb|Classic hyperpigmentation as seen in Addison's disease]]
The symptoms of Addison's disease develop insidiously, and it may take some time to be recognised. The most common [[symptoms]] are [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[lightheadedness]] upon standing or while upright, [[muscle weakness]], [[fever]], weight loss, difficulty in standing up, anxiety, [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[headache]], [[sweating]], changes in [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and [[personality psychology|personality]], and [[arthralgia|joint]] and [[myalgia|muscle pains]]. Some have marked cravings for salt or salty foods due to the urinary losses of sodium.<ref name=Ten/>  Increased [[Sun tanning|tanning]] may be noted, particularly in sun-exposed areas, as well as darkening of the palmar creases, sites of friction, recent scars, the [[vermilion border]] of the lips, and genital skin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nieman LK, Chanco Turner ML |title=Addison's disease |journal=Clin. Dermatol. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=276–80 |year=2006 |pmid=16828409 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2006.04.006}}</ref> This is not encountered in secondary and tertiary hypoadrenalism.<ref name=AdrenalCrisis>{{cite journal | author=de Herder WW, van der Lely AJ | title=Addisonian crisis and relative adrenal failure | journal=Rev Endocr Metab Disord | year=2003 | month=May | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=143–7 | doi=10.1023/A:1022938019091 | pmid=12766542}}</ref>

===Clinical signs===

[[Image:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|right|thumb|200pc|The negative feedback loop for glucocorticoids]]

On examination, the following may be noticed:<ref name=Ten/>
* [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]] that falls further when standing ([[orthostatic hypotension]])
* Most people with primary Addison's have darkening ([[hyperpigmentation]]) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun; characteristic sites are skin creases (e.g. of the hands), nipple, and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa); also, old scars may darken. This occurs because [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (MSH) and [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) share the same precursor molecule, [[pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC). After production in anterior pituitary gland, POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH, ACTH and beta-lipotropin. The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce alpha-MSH, the most important MSH for skin pigmentation. In secondary and tertiary forms of Addison's, skin darkening does not occur.
* Medical conditions, such as [[type I diabetes]], [[thyroid]] disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis and [[goiter]]), and [[vitiligo]] often occur together with Addison's (often in the setting of [[autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome]]). Hence, symptoms and signs of any of the former conditions may also be present in the individual with Addison's. The occurrence of Addison's disease in someone who also has Hashimoto's thyroiditis is called [[Schmidt syndrome]].

=== Addisonian crisis ===

An "Addisonian crisis" or "adrenal crisis" is a constellation of symptoms that indicate severe adrenal insufficiency. This may be the result of either previously undiagnosed Addison's disease, a disease process suddenly affecting adrenal function (such as [[adrenal hemorrhage]]), or an intercurrent problem (e.g. infection, trauma) in someone known to have Addison's disease. It is a [[medical emergency]] and potentially life-threatening situation requiring immediate emergency treatment.

Characteristic symptoms are:<ref>[http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.htm#symptoms Addison's Disease] National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service. Retrieved on 26 October 2007.</ref>
* Sudden penetrating pain in the legs, lower back or abdomen
* Severe [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], resulting in [[dehydration]]
* [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]]
* [[Syncope (medicine)|Syncope]] (loss of consciousness and ability to stand)
* [[Hypoglycemia]] (reduced level of blood glucose)
* Confusion, [[psychosis]], slurred speech
* Severe [[lethargy]]
* [[Hyponatremia]] (low sodium level in the blood)
* [[Hyperkalemia]] (elevated potassium level in the blood)
* [[Hypercalcemia]] (elevated calcium level in the blood)
* [[Non-epileptic seizure|Convulsions]]
* [[Fever]]

== Causes ==

Causes of adrenal insufficiency can be grouped by the way they cause the adrenals to produce insufficient cortisol. These are adrenal dysgenesis (the gland has not formed adequately during development), impaired steroidogenesis (the gland is present but is biochemically unable to produce cortisol) or adrenal destruction (disease processes leading to the gland being damaged).<ref name=Ten/>

===Adrenal dysgenesis===

All causes in this category are genetic, and generally very rare. These include [[genetic mutation|mutations]] to the ''[[Steroidogenic factor 1|SF1]]'' [[transcription factor]], [[X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita|congenital adrenal hypoplasia]] (CAH) due to ''DAX-1'' gene mutations and mutations to the [[ACTH receptor]] gene (or related genes, such as in the [[Triple A syndrome|Triple A]] or Allgrove syndrome). ''DAX-1'' mutations may cluster in a syndrome with [[glycerol kinase]] deficiency with a number of other symptoms when ''DAX-1'' is deleted together with a number of other genes.<ref name=Ten/>

===Impaired steroidogenesis===

To form cortisol, the adrenal gland requires [[cholesterol]], which is then converted biochemically into steroid hormones. Interruptions in the delivery of cholesterol include [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]] and [[abetalipoproteinemia]].<!--May have originally been cited from Ten, needs verification-->

Of the synthesis problems, [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] is the most common (in various forms: [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|21-hydroxylase]], [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17α-hydroxylase]], [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency|11β-hydroxylase]] and [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency|3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]]), [[Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia|lipoid CAH]] due to deficiency of [[steroidogenic acute regulatory protein|StAR]] and [[mitochondrial DNA]] mutations.<ref name=Ten/> Some medications interfere with steroid synthesis enzymes (e.g. [[ketoconazole]]), while others accelerate the normal breakdown of hormones by the [[liver]] (e.g. [[rifampicin]], [[phenytoin]]).<ref name=Ten/>

===Adrenal destruction===

Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of Addison's disease in the industrialized world. [[Autoimmunity|Autoimmune]] destruction of the [[adrenal cortex]] is caused by an immune reaction against the enzyme [[21-hydroxylase]] (a phenomenon first described in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Winqvist O, Karlsson FA, Kämpe O |title=21-Hydroxylase, a major autoantigen in idiopathic Addison's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=339 |issue=8809 |pages=1559–62 |year=1992 |month=June |pmid=1351548 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)91829-W}}</ref> This may be isolated or in the context of [[autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome]] (APS type 1 or 2), in which other hormone-producing organs, such as the [[thyroid]] and [[pancreas]], may also be affected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Husebye ES, Perheentupa J, Rautemaa R, Kämpe O |title=Clinical manifestations and management of patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I |journal=J. Intern. Med. |volume=265 |issue=5 |pages=514–29 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19382991 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2009.02090.x}}</ref>

Adrenal destruction is also a feature of [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD), and when the adrenal glands are involved in [[metastasis]] (seeding of [[cancer]] cells from elsewhere in the body, especially [[lung cancer|lung]]), [[hemorrhage]] (e.g. in [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]] or [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]), particular [[infection]]s ([[tuberculosis]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]]), deposition of abnormal protein in [[amyloidosis]].<ref name=medical-library.net>{{cite web|title=medical-library.net|url=http://www.medical-library.net/content/view/570/41/}}</ref>

===Corticosteroid withdrawal===

Use of high-dose steroids for more than a week begins to produce suppression of the patient's adrenal glands because the exogenous glucocorticoids suppress hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). With prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), and can take months to recover full function after discontinuation of the exogenous glucocorticoid. During this recovery time, the patient is vulnerable to adrenal insufficiency during times of stress, such as illness.<ref name=medicinenet>{{cite web|title=medicinenet|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/steroid_withdrawal/article.htm|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
=== Suggestive features===

Routine investigations may show:<ref name=Ten/>
* [[Hypercalcemia]]
* [[Hypoglycemia]], low [[blood sugar]] (worse in children due to loss of glucocorticoid's glucogenic effects)
* [[Hyponatremia]] (low blood sodium levels), due to the kidney's inability to excrete [[free water]] in the absence of sufficient cortisol, and also the effect of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] to stimulate secretion of [[Vasopressin|ADH]]. That hyponatremia occurs even in secondary adrenal insufficiency (i.e. due to [[pituitary]] disease), in which aldosterone deficiency is '''not''' a feature, underscores the fact that hyponatremia in Addison's disease is not due to lack of aldosterone.
* [[Hyperkalemia]] (raised blood [[potassium]] levels), due to loss of production of the hormone [[aldosterone]].
* [[Eosinophilia]] and [[lymphocytosis]] (increased number of [[eosinophil]]s or [[lymphocyte]]s, two types of [[white blood cell]]s)
* [[Metabolic acidosis]] (increased blood acidity), also is due to loss of the hormone [[aldosterone]] because sodium reabsorption in the [[distal tubule]] is linked with acid/hydrogen ion (H+) secretion. Low levels of aldosterone stimulation of the renal distal tubule leads to sodium wasting in the urine and H+ retention in the serum.

===Testing===

[[Image:Cortisol2.svg|thumb|[[Cortisol]]]]

[[Image:Aldosterone-2D-skeletal.svg|thumb|[[Aldosterone]]]]

In suspected cases of Addison's disease, one needs to demonstrate that adrenal hormone levels are low even after appropriate stimulation (called the [[ACTH stimulation test]]) with synthetic pituitary ACTH hormone [[tetracosactide]]. Two tests are performed, the short and the long test.

The short test compares blood cortisol levels before and after 250 micrograms of tetracosactide (intramuscular or intravenous) is given. If, one hour later, [[Blood plasma|plasma]] cortisol exceeds 170 nmol/l and has risen by at least 330 nmol/l to at least 690 nmol/l, adrenal failure is excluded. If the short test is abnormal, the long test is used to differentiate between primary adrenal insufficiency and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.

The long test uses 1&nbsp;mg tetracosactide (intramuscular). Blood is taken 1, 4, 8, and 24 hr later.  Normal plasma cortisol level should reach 1000 nmol/l by 4 hr. In primary Addison's disease, the cortisol level is reduced at all stages, whereas in secondary corticoadrenal insufficiency, a delayed but normal response is seen.

Other tests may be performed to distinguish between various causes of hypoadrenalism, including [[renin]] and [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] levels, as well as [[medical imaging]] - usually in the form of [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], [[computed tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]].

[[Adrenoleukodystrophy]], and the milder form, [[adrenomyeloneuropathy]], cause adrenal insufficiency combined with neurological symptoms. These diseases are estimated to be the cause of adrenal insufficiency in about 35% of male patients with idiopathic Addison’s disease, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any male with adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis is made by a blood test to detect [[very long chain fatty acid]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal

== Treatment ==
=== Maintenance===

Treatment for Addison's disease involves replacing the missing cortisol, sometimes in the form of [[hydrocortisone]] tablets, or [[prednisone]] tablets in a dosing regimen that mimics the physiological concentrations of cortisol. Alternatively, one-quarter as much [[prednisolone]] may be used for [[Glucocorticoid#Pharmacologic properties|equal glucocorticoid effect]] as hydrocortisone. Treatment must usually be continued for life. In addition, many patients require [[fludrocortisone]] as replacement for the missing aldosterone. Caution must be exercised when persons with Addison's disease become unwell with [[infection]], have [[surgery]] or other [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or become [[pregnant]]. In such instances, their replacement glucocorticoids, whether in the form of hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, or other equivalent, often must be increased. Inability to take oral medication may prompt hospital admission to receive steroids intravenously. People with Addison's are often advised to carry information on them (e.g., in the form of a [[MedicAlert]] bracelet) for the attention of [[emergency medical services]] personnel who might need to attend to their needs.

===Crisis===

Standard therapy involves intravenous injections of glucocorticoids and large volumes of intravenous saline solution with dextrose ([[glucose]]). This treatment usually brings rapid improvement. When the patient can take fluids and medications by mouth, the amount of glucocorticoids is decreased until a maintenance dose is reached. If aldosterone is deficient, maintenance therapy also includes oral doses of fludrocortisone acetate.<ref>[http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.htm] National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service.

== Epidemiology ==

The frequency rate of Addison's disease in the human population is sometimes estimated at roughly one in 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/addison_disease/article.htm |title=Addison Disease � Health information regarding this hormonal (endocrine) disorder on MedicineNet.com |accessdate=2007-07-25 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070624044454/http://www.medicinenet.com/addison_disease/article.htm| archivedate= 24 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>   Some research and information sites put the number closer to 40-60 cases per million population.

(Determining accurate numbers for Addison's is problematic at best and some incidence figures are thought to be underestimates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medhelp.org/www/nadf3.htm |title=medhelp |accessdate=2007-07-25 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070706231235/http://www.medhelp.org/www/nadf3.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-07-06}}</ref>)
Addison's can afflict persons of any age, gender, or ethnicity, but it typically presents in adults between 30 and 50 years of age.<ref>{{cite book |title=Autoimmune Diseases of the Endocrine System |last=Volpé |first=Robert |year=1990 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0-8493-6849-9 |pages=299}}</ref> Research has shown no significant predispositions based on ethnicity.<ref name="emedicinemed42"/>

==Prognosis==
With proper medication, especially hormone replacement therapy, patients can expect to live healthy and normal lives.<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000378.htm</ref>

People with adrenal insufficiency should always carry identification stating their condition in case of an emergency. The card should alert emergency personnel about the need to inject 100&nbsp;mg of cortisol if its bearer is found severely injured or unable to answer questions. The card should also include the doctor's name and telephone number and the name and telephone number of the nearest relative to be notified.<ref>http://www.addisons.org.uk/topics/2006/03/0021.html</ref>

When traveling, a needle, syringe, and an injectable form of cortisol should be carried for emergencies. A person with Addison's disease also should know how to increase medication during periods of stress or mild upper respiratory infections. Immediate medical attention is needed when severe infections, vomiting, or diarrhea occurs, as these conditions can precipitate an Addisonian crisis. A patient who is vomiting may require injections of hydrocortisone, since oral hydrocortisone supplements cannot be adequately metabolised.<ref>http://www.addisons.org.uk/info/emergency/page2.html</ref>

==History==
===Discovery and development===
Addison’s disease is named after Dr. [[Thomas Addison]], the British [[physician]] who first described the condition in ''On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsules'' (1849).<ref>{{cite book | author = Thomas Addison | authorlink = Thomas Addison  | title = On The Constitutional And Local Effects Of Disease Of The Supra-Renal Capsules | url = http://www.wehner.org/addison/x1.htm | publisher = Samuel Highley | location = London | year = 1855}}</ref> All of Addison's six original patients had tuberculosis of the adrenal glands.<ref name="pmid18591375">{{cite journal |author=Patnaik MM, Deshpande AK |title=Diagnosis–Addison's Disease Secondary to Tuberculosis of the Adrenal Glands |journal=Clin Med Res |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=29 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18591375 |pmc=2442022 |doi=10.3121/cmr.2007.754a |url=http://www.clinmedres.org/cgi/content/full/6/1/29}}</ref> While Addison's six patients in 1855 all had adrenal tuberculosis, the term "Addison's disease" does not imply an underlying disease process.

The condition was initially considered a form of anemia associated with the adrenal glands. Because little was known at the time about the adrenal glands (then called "Supra-Renal Capsules"), Dr. Addison’s monograph describing the condition was an isolated insight. As the adrenal function became better known, Dr. Addison’s monograph became known as an important medical contribution and a classic example of careful medical observation.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2081266/</ref>

== In other animals ==

{{main|Addison's disease in canines}}
The condition has been diagnosed in all breeds of dogs. In general, it is underdiagnosed, and one must clinically suspect it as an underlying disorder for many presenting complaints. Females are overrepresented, and the disease often appears in middle age (4–7 yr), although any age or either gender may be affected. Genetic continuity between dogs and humans helps to explain the occurrence of Addison's disease in both species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/air/dog_days.htm |title=Dog Days Of Science |accessdate=2008-09-01 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080921135843/http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/air/dog_days.htm| archivedate= 21 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Hypoadrenocorticism is treated with fludrocortisone or a monthly injection called Percorten V (desoxycorticosterone pivlate (DOCP)) and prednisone.  Routine blood work is necessary in the initial stages until a maintenance dose is established. Most of the medications used in the therapy of hypoadrenocorticism cause excessive thirst and urination, making it important to provide enough drinking water.  If the owner knows about an upcoming stressful situation (shows, traveling, etc.), patients generally need an increased dose of prednisone to help deal with the added stress.  Avoidance of stress is important for dogs with hypoadrenocorticism.
