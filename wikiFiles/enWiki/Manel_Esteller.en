'''Manel Esteller''' ([[Sant Boi de Llobregat]], [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Spain, 1968) graduated in Medicine from the [[University of Barcelona]] in 1992, where he also obtained his doctorate, specialising in the [[molecular genetics]] of endometrial carcinoma, in 1996.  He was an invited researcher at the School of Biological and Medical Sciences at the [[University of St Andrews]], [[Scotland]], during which time his research interests focused on the molecular genetics of inherited breast cancer.

Esteller works on the field of [[epigenetics]] in health and disease.  Starting from identical [[genetic sequence]]s, changes in [[histone]] modifications and [[DNA methylation]] can produce organisms with different features and distinct susceptibility to sickness.  An example is [[Monozygotic_twins#Identical (monozygotic) twins|monozygotic twins]].  To have a complete picture of what is going on with the epigenetic tapestry of our cells, Esteller has advocated the development of a comprehensive [[Human Epigenome Project]] (HEP) to map all the epigenetic marks in our genetic material.  This could have a huge impact in [[cancer]] patients, because we already know that [[Malignancy|malignant cells]] have a profound disregulation of DNA methylation and histone modification patterns.  The good news is that the first pharmacological compounds to "restore" the normal epigenetic landscapes are starting to emerge.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/health/05gene.html?_r=1 |title=Explaining Differences in Twins - New York Times |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 July 2005  |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://esi-topics.com/genesil2006/interviews/ManelEsteller.html |title=Gene Silencing 2006 - Interview with Dr. Manel Esteller |first= |last=Staff|work=esi-topics.com |date=March 2007|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref>
