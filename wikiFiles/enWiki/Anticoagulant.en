An '''anticoagulant''' is a substance that prevents [[blood coagulation|coagulation]] (clotting) of blood. Such substances occur naturally in leeches and blood-sucking insects. A group of pharmaceuticals called anticoagulants can be used ''[[in vivo]]'' as a medication for [[thrombosis|thrombotic]] disorders. Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment, such as [[test tube]]s, [[blood transfusion]] bags, and [[renal dialysis]] equipment.

==As medications==
Anticoagulants reduce blood clotting.  This prevents [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[myocardial infarction]] and [[stroke]]. 

===Coumarins (vitamin K antagonists)===<!--this section heading is linked to from [[Warfarin]]-->
{{Further|Vitamin K antagonist}}
These oral anticoagulants are derived from [[coumarin]], which is found in many plants. A prominent member of this class is [[warfarin]] (coumadin).  It takes at least 48 to 72 hours for the anticoagulant effect to develop. Where an immediate effect is required, [[heparin]] must be given concomitantly.  These anticoagulants are used to treat patients with [[deep-vein thrombosis]] (DVT), [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE),  [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF), and mechanical [[prosthetic heart valve]]s.

====Adverse effects====
Patients aged 80 years or more may be especially susceptible to bleeding complications, with a rate of 13 bleeds per 100 person-years.<ref name="pmid17515465">{{cite journal |author=Hylek EM, Evans-Molina C, Shea C, Henault LE, Regan S |title=Major hemorrhage and tolerability of warfarin in the first year of therapy among elderly patients with atrial fibrillation |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=21 |pages=2689–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17515465 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.653048}}</ref> These oral anticoagulants are used widely as poisons for mammalian pests, especially [[rodents]]. (For details, see [[rodenticide]] and [[warfarin]].) Depletion of vitamin K by coumadin therapy increases risk of arterial calcification and heart valve calcification, especially if too much vitamin D is present.<ref name='Adams2005'>{{cite journal | title = Vitamin K in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and arterial calcification | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 1 Aug 2005 | authors = Adams J, Pepping J | volume = 62 | issue = 15 | pages = 1574–81 | id =  | doi = 10.2146/ajhp040357 | url = http://www.scicompdf.se/osteolis/adams_2005.pdf | accessdate = 2012-10-03 | pmid=16030366}}</ref>

====Available agents====

* [[Warfarin]] (coumadin)  is the main agent used in the US and UK.<ref name="WSJOct2007">{{cite news

* [[Acenocoumarol]] and [[phenprocoumon]] are used more commonly outside the US and the UK.
* [[Atromentin]]
* [[Brodifacoum]] is used as rat poison, but is not used medically.
* [[Phenindione]]

===Heparin and derivative substances===
[[Heparin]] is a biological substance, usually made from [[pig]] intestines. It works by activating [[antithrombin III]], which blocks thrombin from clotting blood. Heparin can be used ''[[in vivo]]'' (by injection), and also ''[[in vitro]]'' to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices. Vacutainer brand test tubes containing heparin are usually colored green.

====Major pharmaceutical heparin recall due to contamination====
In March 2008, major recalls of heparin were announced by pharmaceutical companies due to a suspected and unknown contamination of the raw heparin stock imported from China.<ref>''New York Times'', March 6, 2008 Drug Tied to China Had Contaminant, F.D.A. Says'', retrieved 2008-03-07</ref><ref>''New York Times'', March 7, 2008 German Authorities Report Problems With Blood Thinner'', retrieved 2008-03-07</ref>  The contaminant was later found to be a compound called oversulfated chondroitin sulfate.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Blossom DB ''et al.'' | year = 2008 | title = Outbreak of adverse reactions associated with contaminated heparin | url = | journal = N Engl J Med. | volume = 359 | issue = 25| pages = 2674–84 }}</ref>  The US Food and Drug Administration was quoted as stating at least 19 deaths were believed linked to a raw heparin ingredient imported from the People's Republic of China, and they had also received 785 reports of serious injuries associated with the drug’s use. According to the New York Times: 'Problems with heparin reported to the agency include difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and rapidly falling blood pressure that in some cases led to life-threatening shock'.

====Low molecular weight heparin====
[[Low molecular weight heparin]], a more highly processed product, is useful as it does not require monitoring of the [[APTT]] [[coagulation]] parameter (it has more predictable plasma levels) and has fewer side effects.

====Synthetic pentasaccharide inhibitors of factor Xa====
* [[Fondaparinux]] is a synthetic sugar composed of the five sugars (pentasaccharide) in heparin that bind to antithrombin.  It is a smaller molecule than low molecular weight heparin.
* [[Idraparinux]]

===Direct factor Xa inhibitors===
{{main|Direct Xa inhibitor}}
Drugs such as [[rivaroxaban]] and [[apixaban]] work by inhibiting factor Xa directly (unlike the heparins and fondaparinux, which work via antithrombin activation).

===Direct thrombin inhibitors===
{{main|direct thrombin inhibitor}}
Another type of anticoagulant is the [[direct thrombin inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid16148288">{{cite journal |author=Di Nisio M, Middeldorp S, Büller HR |title=Direct thrombin inhibitors |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=353 |issue=10 |pages=1028–40 |year=2005 |pmid=16148288 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra044440}}</ref>  Current members of this class include the bivalent drugs [[hirudin]], [[lepirudin]], and [[bivalirudin]]; and the monovalent drugs [[argatroban]] and [[dabigatran]].  An oral direct thrombin inhibitor, [[ximelagatran]] (Exanta) was denied approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in September 2004 [http://www.fvleiden.org/ask/73.html] and was pulled from the market entirely in February 2006 after reports of severe liver damage and heart attacks. [http://www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com/article/512052.aspx] In November 2010, dabigatran was approved by the FDA to treat [[atrial fibrillation]].

===Antithrombin protein therapeutics===
The antithrombin protein itself is used as a [[Biologic medical product|protein therapeutic]] that can be purified from human plasma<ref name=ThrombateLabel>[http://www.talecris-pi.info/inserts/thrombate.pdf Thrombate III label]</ref> or produced recombinantly (for example, Atryn, which is produced in the milk of [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] goats.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/LicensedProductsBLAs/FractionatedPlasmaProducts/ucm134042.htm FDA website for ATryn (BL 125284)]</ref><ref name=ATrynLabel>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/LicensedProductsBLAs/FractionatedPlasmaProducts/UCM134045.pdf Antithrombin (Recombinant) US Package Insert  ATryn for Injection February 3, 2009]</ref>)

Antithrombin is approved by the FDA as an anticoagulant for the prevention of clots before, during, or after surgery or birthing in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency.<ref name=ThrombateLabel/><ref name=ATrynLabel/>

===Other types of anticoagulants===
Many other anticoagulants exist, for use in [[research and development]], [[diagnostics]], or as drug candidates. 
* [[Batroxobin]], a [[toxin]] from a [[snake]] [[venom]], clots platelet-rich plasma without affecting [[platelet]] functions (lyses [[fibrinogen]]).
* [[Hementin]] is an anticoagulant protease from the salivary glands of the giant Amazon leech, ''[[Haementeria ghilianii]]''.

==Food and herbal supplements==
Foods and food supplements with blood-thinning effects include [[nattokinase]], [[lumbrokinase]], [[alfalfa]], [[avocado]], [[beer]], [[bilberry]], [[cat's claw]], [[celery]], [[coenzyme Q10]], [[cranberries]], [[fish oil]], [[garlic]], [[ginger]], [[ginkgo]], [[ginseng]], [[grapefruit]], [[green tea]], [[horse chestnut]], [[licorice]], [[niacin]], [[onion]], [[papaya]], [[pomegranate]], [[red clover]], [[soybean]], [[St. John’s wort]], [[turmeric]], [[wheatgrass]], and [[willow]] bark.<ref name="pmid11711691">{{cite journal |author=Wittkowsky AK |title=Drug interactions update: drugs, herbs, and oral anticoagulation |journal=J. Thromb.

Multivitamins that do not interact with clotting are available for patients on anticoagulants.

==General indications==
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
Therapeutic uses of anticoagulants include [[atrial fibrillation]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[venous thromboembolism]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], and genetic or acquired [[hypercoagulability]].

==Laboratory use==
[[Medical laboratory|Laboratory]] instruments, blood transfusion bags, and medical and surgical equipment will get clogged up and become nonoperational if blood is allowed to clot. In addition, test tubes used for laboratory blood tests will have chemicals added to stop blood clotting. Apart from heparin, most of these chemicals work by [[chelation|binding]] [[calcium]] ions, preventing the [[coagulation]] proteins from using them.
* [[EDTA]] strongly and irreversibly binds calcium. It is in a powdered form.
* [[Citrate]] is in liquid form in the tube and is used for coagulation tests, as well as in blood transfusion bags. It binds the calcium, but not as strongly as EDTA. Correct proportion of this anticoagulant to blood is crucial because of the dilution, and it can be reversed with the addition of calcium. It can be in the form of [[Monosodium citrate|sodium citrate]] or [[acid-citrate-dextrose]].
* [[Oxalate]] has a mechanism similar to that of citrate. It is the anticoagulant used in fluoride oxalate tubes used to determine glucose and lactate levels.
