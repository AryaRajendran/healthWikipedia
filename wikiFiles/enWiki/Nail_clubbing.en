[[Idiopathic]] clubbing can also occur, and 60% of cases have no associated underlying disease.<ref name=Vandemergel>{{cite journal |author=Vandemergel X, Renneboog B |title=Prevalence, aetiologies and significance of clubbing in a department of general internal medicine |journal=Eur.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Double image|right|Clubbing2.JPG|200|Clubbing1.JPG|200|Front and side views of nail clubbing||}}
Clubbing develops in five steps:<ref name=Myers>{{cite journal | author=Myers KA, Farquhar DR | title=The rational clinical examination: does this patient have clubbing? | journal=JAMA | year=2001 | volume=286 | pages=341–7 | pmid=11466101 | url= | doi=10.1001/jama.286.3.341 | issue=3}}</ref>
# Fluctuation and softening of the nail bed (increased ballotability)
# Loss of the normal <165° angle (Lovibond angle) between the nailbed and the fold (cuticula)
# Increased convexity of the nail fold
# Thickening of the whole [[distal]] (end part of the) finger (resembling a drumstick)
# Shiny aspect and [[wikt:striation|striation]] of the nail and skin

Schamroth's test or Schamroth's window test (originally demonstrated by South African cardiologist [[Leo Schamroth]] on himself)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schamroth L |title=Personal experience |journal=S. Afr. Med. J. |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=297–300 |year=1976 |month=February |pmid=1265563}}</ref> is a popular test for clubbing. When the distal [[phalanges]] (bones nearest the fingertips) of corresponding fingers of opposite hands are directly [[wikt:opposed|opposed]] (place fingernails of same finger on opposite hands against each other, nail to nail), a small diamond-shaped "window" is normally apparent between the nailbeds. If this window is obliterated, the test is positive and clubbing is present.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Clubbing.svg|thumb|Clubbing of the fingernail: The red line shows the outline of a clubbed nail.]]

When clubbing is encountered in patients, doctors will seek to identify its cause. They usually accomplish this by obtaining a [[medical history]]—particular attention is paid to lung, heart, and gastrointestinal conditions—and conducting a [[clinical examination]], which may disclose associated features relevant to a diagnosis. Additional studies such as a [[chest X-ray]] and a chest CT-scan may also be performed.<ref name=Myers/>

==Disease associations==
Although many diseases are associated with clubbing (particularly lung diseases), the reports are fairly anecdotal. Prospective studies of patients presenting with clubbing have not yet been performed, and hence there is no conclusive evidence of these associations.

===Isolated clubbing===
Clubbing is associated with:
* Lung disease:
** [[Lung cancer]], mainly non-small-cell (54% of all cases), not seen frequently in small-cell lung cancer (< 5% of cases)<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sridhar KS, Lobo CF, Altman RD | title=Digital clubbing and lung cancer | journal=Chest | year=1998 | volume=114 | pages=1535–37 | pmid=9872183 | url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/114/6/1535 | format=PDF | doi=10.1378/chest.114.6.1535 | issue=6}}</ref>
** [[Interstitial lung disease]]
** Complicated [[tuberculosis]]
** Suppurative lung disease: [[lung abscess]], [[empyema]], [[bronchiectasis]], [[cystic fibrosis]]
** [[Mesothelioma]] of the pleura
**  Arteriovenous fistula or malformation
* Heart disease:
** Any disease featuring chronic [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]
** Congenital [[cyanotic heart disease]] (most common cardiac cause)
** [[Endocarditis|Subacute bacterial endocarditis]]
** [[Atrial myxoma]] (benign tumor)
* Gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary:
** [[Malabsorption]]
** [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]]
** [[Cirrhosis]], especially in [[primary biliary cirrhosis]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Epstein O, Dick R, Sherlock S |title=Prospective study of periostitis and finger clubbing in primary biliary cirrhosis and other forms of chronic liver disease |journal=Gut |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=203–6 |year=1981 |pmid=7227854 |doi=10.1136/gut.22.3.203 |pmc=1419499}}</ref>
** [[Hepatopulmonary syndrome]], a complication of cirrhosis<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12715285 | volume=133 | issue=11–12 | title=Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension | year=2003 | month=March | author=Naeije R | journal=Swiss Med Wkly | pages=163–9}}</ref>
* Others:
** [[Hyperthyroidism]] (''thyroid [[acropachy]]'')<ref>{{GPnotebook|-724565997}}</ref>
** Familial and racial clubbing and "pseudoclubbing" (people of African descent often have what appears to be clubbing)
** Vascular anomalies of the affected arm such as an [[axillary artery aneurysm]] (in unilateral clubbing)

Nail clubbing is ''not'' associated with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). Therefore, in patients with COPD with significant degrees of clubbing, a search for signs of bronchogenic carcinoma (or other causes of clubbing) might be indicated.<ref name=Myers/>

===HPOA===
{{main|Periosteal reaction}}
[[File:Marie-Bamberger2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bone scan]] of a patient with HPOA]]
A special form of clubbing is [[hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy]], known in continental Europe as Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome. This is the combination of clubbing and thickening of [[periosteum]] (connective tissue lining of the bones) and [[synovium]] (lining of joints), and is often initially diagnosed as [[arthritis]]. It is commonly associated with lung cancer.

===Primary HPOA===
Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is HPOA without signs of pulmonary disease. This form has a hereditary component, although subtle cardiac abnormalities can occasionally be found. It is known eponymously as the Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome. This condition has been linked to mutations in the gene on the fourth chromosome (4q33-q34) coding for the enzyme [[15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (NAD+)|15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase]] (HPGD); this leads to decreased breakdown of [[PGE2|prostaglandin E2]] and elevated levels of this substance.<ref name=Uppal>{{cite journal |author=Uppal S, Diggle CP, Carr IM, ''et al.'' |title=Mutations in 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase cause primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=789–93 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18500342 |doi=10.1038/ng.153}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The exact cause for sporadic clubbing is unknown, with numerous theories as to its cause. [[Vasodilation]] (distended blood vessels), secretion of [[growth factor]]s (such as [[platelet-derived growth factor]] and [[hepatocyte growth factor]]) from the lungs, and other mechanisms have been proposed. The discovery of disorders in the [[prostaglandin]] metabolism in primary osteoarthropathy has led to suggestions that overproduction of PGE2 by other tissues may be the causative factor for clubbing.<ref name=Uppal/>

==Epidemiology==
The exact frequency of clubbing in the population is not known. A 2008 study found clubbing in 1% of all patients admitted to a department of [[internal medicine]]. Of these, 40% turned out to have significant underlying disease of various causes, while 60% had no medical problems on further investigations and remained well over the subsequent year.<ref name=Vandemergel/>
