'''The Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA)''' is "the professional body responsible for the specialty of [[anaesthesia]] throughout the [[United Kingdom]]". It sets standards in anaesthesia, [[Intensive care medicine|critical care]], [[pain management]], and for the training of [[anaesthetists]], physician assistants (anaesthesia) - (specialist non-doctor anaesthetists) and practising critical care physicians. It also holds examinations for anaesthetists in training, publishes the [[British Journal of Anaesthesia]], and informs and educates the public about anaesthesia. Its headquarters is in [[Churchill House]], [[London]].

==Role==
The College’s activities are varied, but include the setting of standards of clinical care, establishing the standards for the training of anaesthetists and those practising critical care and acute and chronic pain management, setting and running examinations, and the continued medical education of all practising anaesthetists.

==Publications==
The College publishes guidance for its members and also has a newsletter (The College Bulletin), a journal ([[British Journal of Anaesthesia]]) and an educational journal (Continuing Education in Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain). The latter is written in collaboration with the [[Intensive Care Society]] and the [[British Pain Society]].

==History==
The Royal College of Anaesthetists was awarded its royal charter in 1992, making it one of the youngest Royal Colleges of medicine.  Prior to this time, it had existed as the '''College of Anaesthetists''' since 1988, when it split from the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. Prior to 1988, it was known as the '''Faculty of Anaesthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons of England''', which was formed in 1948. The roots of the college can be traced back to the [[Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland]], which was set up in 1932 by Sir [[Ivan Magill]] and others, and continues today.

==Coat of arms and motto==
The [[Coat of arms]] of the College shares some symbols and features with that of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. It also incorporates [[coca]] leaves to symbolise [[local anaesthesia]], and [[opium poppy]] heads to symbolise [[analgesia]]. The figures on either side of the shield (known as '''supporters''') are two pioneers of anaesthesia, [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] and [[Joseph Thomas Clover]].

The College's motto is “''Divinum sedare dolorem''”  (it is divine to alleviate pain).

==Examinations==
