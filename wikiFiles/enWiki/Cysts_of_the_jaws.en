A cyst is an epithelial lined cavity that fills with fluid or soft material and usually grows from internal pressure generated by fluid being drawn into the cavity from [[osmosis]] (hydrostatic pressure). The bones of the jaws, the [[human mandible|mandible]] and [[maxilla]], are the [[bone]]s with the highest prevalence of [[cyst]]s in the human body. This is due to the abundant amount of [[epithelium|epithelial]] remnants that can be left in the bones of the jaws.  The [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of [[teeth]] is formed from [[ectoderm]] (the precursor germ layer to skin and [[mucosa]]), and so remnants of epithelium can be left in the bone during [[odontogenesis]] (tooth development). The bones of the jaws develop from [[embryology|embryologic]] processes which fuse together, and ectodermal tissue may be trapped along the lines of this fusion.<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=450–456|edition=5th ed.}}</ref> This "resting" epithelium (also termed cell rests) is usually dormant or undergoes [[atrophy]], but, when stimulated, may form a cyst. The reasons why resting epithelium may proliferate and undergo cystic transformation are generally unknown, but [[inflammation]] is thought to be a major factor.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> The high prevalence of [[tooth impaction]]s and [[dental infection]]s that occur in the bones of the jaws is also significant to explain why cysts are more common at these sites.

Cysts that arise from tissue(s) that would normally develop into teeth are referred to as [[odontogenic cyst]]s. Other cysts of the jaws are termed non-odontogenic cysts.<ref name="Neville 2002">{{cite book |last=Neville |first=Brad W. |authorlink= |last2=Damm |first2=Douglas D. |last3=Allen |first3=Carl M. |last4= Bouquot |first4= Jerry E.|title=Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology (2nd edition) |url= |accessdate= |year=2002 |publisher=W.B.

As the cyst grows from [[hydraulics|hydraulic pressure]] it causes the bone around it to resorb, and may cause movement of teeth or other vital structures such as nerves and blood vessels, or resorb the roots of teeth. Most cysts do not cause any symptoms, and are discovered on routine [[dental radiography|dental radiographs]].<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
Some cysts may not require any treatment, but if treatment is required, it usually involves some minor surgery to partially or completely remove the cyst in a one or two-stage procedure.

==Classification==

===Odontogenic cysts===
[[File:JawCyst (with arrows).jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[Panoramic radiograph|Dental panoramic radiograph]] showing [[dentigerous cyst]] associated with an impacted lower right [[wisdom tooth]] in the right mandible (arrowed, appears on the lower left of the image).]]
{{Main|odontogenic cyst}}
Odontogenic cysts have histologic origins in the cells of the dental structures.  Some are inflammatory while others are developmental.
* '''[[Radicular cyst]]''' is the most common (up to two thirds of all cysts of the jaws). This [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] cyst originated from a reaction to [[Necrotic pulp|dental pulp necrosis]].
* '''[[Dentigerous cyst]]''', the second most prevalent cyst, is associated with the crown of non-erupted tooth.
* '''[[Odontogenic keratocyst]]''', which now is considered as tumor, and therefore called ''Keratocystic odontogenic tumor''. This [[lesion]] may be associated with the [[Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]].
* '''[[Buccal bifurcation cyst]]''' which appears in the [[Cheek|buccal]] bifurcation region of the [[human mandible|mandibular]] first [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s in the second half of the first decade of life.<ref name="BBC">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Yitschaky O, Neuman T, Nitzan DW |title=On the Self-Resolution Nature of the Buccal Bifurcation Cyst |journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=e15 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21571416 |doi=10.1016/j.joms.2011.02.124|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WKF-52VP3D1-6&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F14%2F2011&_rdoc=9&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236905%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&_cdi=6905&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=207&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=47e40681e02990c1d46b7f818fe30630&searchtype=a}}</ref>
*[[Eruption cyst]]; a small cyst in the gingiva as a tooth erupts, forming from the degenerating dental follicle
*[[Primordial cyst]]; previous thought to me a unique entity.  Most primordial cysts have proven to be [[Keratocystic odontogenic tumor]]s
*[[Keratocystic odontogenic tumor|Orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst]]; a variant of the [[Keratocystic odontogenic tumor]]
*[[Gingival cyst of the newborn]]; an inclusion cyst from remanents of the dental lamina on a newborn gingiva
*[[Gingival cyst of the adult]]; a soft tissue variant of the [[lateral periodontal cyst]]
*[[Lateral periodontal cyst]]; a non-inflammatory cyst (vs a [[radicular cyst]] on the side of a tooth derived from remanents of the dental lamina
*[[Calcifying odontogenic cyst]]; a rare lesion with cystic and neoplastic features and significant diversity in presentation, histology and prognosis
*[[Glandular odontogenic cyst]]; cyst with respiratory like epithelial lining and the potential for recurrence with characteristics similar to a central variant of low-grade [[mucoepidermoid carcinoma]]

===Developmental/ Non-odontogenic cysts===
There are several development cysts of the head and neck most of which form in the soft tissues rather than the bone. There are also several cysts, previously thought to arise from epithelial remanents trapped in embryonic lines of fusion, most of which are now believed to be odontogenic in origin or have an unknown etiology.  There names are included for the sake of completeness.

====Developmental cysts of the jaws====
*'''[[Nasopalatine duct cyst]]''', the most common development jaw cyst, appears only in the mid-line of the maxilla.

====Developmental cysts of the soft tissues around the jaws====
*Palatal cysts of the newborn ([[Epstein's pearls]])
*[[Nasolabial cyst]] (nasoalveolar cyst)
*[[Epidermoid cyst]] of the skin
*[[Dermoid cyst]]
*[[Thyroglossal duct cyst]]
*[[Branchial cleft cyst]] (Cervical lymphoepitelial cyst)
*Oral lymphoepithelial cyst

====Developmental cysts of questionable etiology====
*[[Globulomaxillary cyst]]
*[[Median palatal cyst]]
*[[Median mandibular cyst]]

==Signs and symptoms==
Cysts rarely cause any symptoms, unless they become [[secondary infection|secondarily infected]].<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> The signs depend mostly upon the size and location of the cyst. If the cyst has not expanded beyond the normal anatomical boundaries of the bone, then there will be no [[palpation|palpable]] lump outside or inside the mouth. The vast majority of cysts expand slowly, and the surrounding bone has time to increase its density around the lesion, which is the body's attempt to isolate the lesion. Cysts that have expanded beyond the normal anatomic boundaries of a bone are still often covered with a thin layer of new bone. At this stage, there may be a sign termed "eggshell cracking", where the thinned [[cortical bone|cortical plate]] cracks when pressure is applied. A lump may be felt, which may be feel hard if there is still bone covering the cyst, or fluctuant if the cyst has eroded through the bone surrounding it.<ref name="Wray 2003">{{cite book|last=Wray D, Stenhouse D, Lee D, Clark AJE|title=Textbook of general and oral surgery|year=2003|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh [etc.]|isbn=0443070830|pages=229–237}}</ref> A cyst may become acutely infected, and discharge into the oral cavity via a sinus. Adjacent teeth may be loosened, tilted or even moved bodily. Rarely, roots of teeth are resorbed, depending upon the type of cyst. The [[inferior alveolar nerve]] runs through the mandible and supplies sensation to the lower lip and chin. As most cysts expand slowly, there will be no altered sensation ([[anesthesia]] or [[paraesthesia]]), since the inferior alveolar canal is harmlessly enveloped or displaced over time. More aggressive cysts, or acute infection of any cyst may cause altered sensation.

==Diagnosis==
Most cysts are discovered as a chance finding on routine dental radiography. On an x-ray, cysts appear as radiolucent (dark) areas with radiopaque (white) borders. Cysts are usually unilocular, but may also be multilocular. Sometimes aspiration is used to aid diagnosis of a cystic lesion, e.g. fluid aspirate from a radicular cyst may appear straw colored and display shimmering due to [[cholesterol]] content.<ref name="Wray 2003" /> Almost always, the cyst lining is sent to a [[pathologist]] for [[histopathology|histopathologic]] examination after it has been surgically removed. This means that the exact diagnosis of the type of cyst is often made in retrospect.

==Treatment==
When treatment is required, this is usually by surgical removal of the cyst. There are four ways in which cysts are managed:<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 

* [[Enucleation (surgery)|Enucleation]] - removal of the entire cyst
* [[Marsupialization]] - the creation of a window into the wall of a cyst, allowing the contents to be drained. The window is left open, and the lack of pressure within the cyst causes the lesion to shrink, as the surrounding bone starts to fill in again. 
* Enucleation following marsupialization - Sometimes marsupialization is carried out as a single procedure, but usually it is followed by a second procedure to remove the cyst. This is particularly the case when cysts are very large and their removal would leave a significant surgical defect.
* Enucleation with [[curettage]] - this is removal of the cyst and some of the surrounding bone, which may contain some of the lining of the cyst.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends upon the type, size and location of a cyst. Most cysts are entirely benign, and some may require no treatment. Rarely, some cystic lesions represent locally aggressive tumors that may cause destruction of surrounding bone if left untreated. This type of cyst are usually removed with a margin of healthy bone to prevent recurrence of new cysts. If a cyst expands to a very large size, the mandible may be weakened such that a [[pathologic fracture]] occurs.

==Epidemiology==
Radicular cysts are by far the most common cyst occurring in the jaws.<ref name="Wray 2003" />
