==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the annual incidence rate of pneumonia is approximately 6 cases per 1000 people in individuals aged 18–39 years. For those over 75 years of age, the incidence rate rises to 75 cases per 1000 people. Roughly 20–40% of individuals who contract pneumonia require hospital admission, with between 5–10% of these admitted to a [[critical care unit]]. The case fatality rate in the UK is around 5–10%.<ref name=BMJ06>{{cite journal|last=Hoare|first=Z|coauthors=Lim, WS|title=Pneumonia: update on diagnosis and management.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2006-05-06|volume=332|issue=7549|pages=1077–9|pmid=16675815|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7549.1077|pmc=1458569}}</ref>

==United States==
In the United States, community-acquired pneumonia affects 5.6 million people per year, and ranks 6th among leading causes of death.<ref name=EOP10>{{cite journal |author=Anevlavis S | coauthors = Bouros D |title=Community acquired bacterial pneumonia|journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=361–74 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20085502|doi=10.1517/14656560903508770 }}</ref>

==Other population groups==
More cases of community acquired pneumonia occur during the winter months than at other times of the year. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in males than in females, and more often among Blacks than Caucasians, partly due to quantitative differences in synthesizing [[Vitamin D]] after exposure to sunlight.<ref name=Almirall>{{cite journal |author=Almirall J |coauthors = Bolíbar I, Balanzó X, González CA |title=Risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia in adults: a population-based case-control study |journal=Eur.

Individuals with underlying chronic illnesses, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[emphysema]], and [[immunosuppression|immune system problems]] as well as [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smokers]], [[alcoholism|alcoholics]], and individuals who are hospitalized for any reason, are at significantly increased risk of contracting, and having repeated bouts of, pneumonia.<ref name=Almirall>{{cite journal |author=Almirall J |coauthors = Bolíbar I, Balanzó X, González CA |title=Risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia in adults: a population-based case-control study |journal=Eur.
