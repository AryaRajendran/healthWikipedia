'''Boron trichloride''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the formula BCl<sub>3</sub>. This colorless gas is a valuable reagent in [[organic synthesis]]. It is highly reactive toward water.

==Production and structure==
Boron reacts with [[halogens]] to give the corresponding trihalides. Boron trichloride is, however, produced industrially by direct [[halogenation|chlorination]] of [[boron oxide]] and [[carbon]] at 500 °C.
:B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 C + 3 Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2 BCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 CO
The [[carbothermal synthesis]] is analogous to the [[Kroll process]] for the conversion of titanium dioxide to titanium tetrachloride. In the laboratory BF<sub>3</sub> reacted with AlCl<sub>3</sub> gives BCl<sub>3</sub> via halogen exchange.<ref name=greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}}</ref> BCl<sub>3</sub> is a trigonal planar molecule like the other boron trihalides, and has a bond length of 175pm. 

A degree of π-bonding has been proposed to explain the short B<nowiki>&minus;</nowiki> Cl distance although there is some debate as to its extent.<ref name = greenwood /> It does not dimerize, although NMR studies of mixtures of boron trihalides shows the presence of mixed halides. The absence of dimerisation contrasts with the tendencies of [[aluminium trichloride|AlCl<sub>3</sub>]] and [[gallium trichloride|GaCl<sub>3</sub>]], which form dimers or polymers with 4 or 6 coordinate metal centres.

==Reactions==
BCl<sub>3</sub> hydrolyzes readily to give boric acid:
:BCl<sub>3</sub>  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O   →   B(OH)<sub>3</sub>  +  3 HCl
Alcohols behave analogously giving the borate esters, e.g. [[trimethyl borate]].
As a strong [[Lewis acid]], BCl<sub>3</sub> i forms [[adduct]]s with tertiary [[amine]]s, [[phosphines]], [[ethers]], [[thioether]]s, and [[halide]] ions.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gerrard, W., Lappert, M. F. | title = Reactions Of Boron Trichloride With Organic Compounds | journal = [[Chemical Reviews]] | year = 1958 | volume = 58 | issue = 6 | pages = 1081–1111 | doi = 10.1021/cr50024a003 }}</ref> For example, BCl<sub>3</sub> · S(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (CAS# 5523-19-3) is often employed as a conveniently handled source of BCl<sub>3</sub> because this solid (m.p.&nbsp;88-90 °C) releases BCl<sub>3</sub>:
:(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S·BCl<sub>3</sub>   &#x21CC;   (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S  +  BCl<sub>3</sub>

The mixed [[aryl]] and [[alkyl]] boron chlorides are also of known. [[Phenyl]]boron dichloride is commercially available. Such species can be prepared by the [[redistribution reaction]] of BCl<sub>3</sub> with organotin reagents:
:2 BCl<sub>3</sub>  +  R<sub>4</sub>Sn   &rarr; 2   RBCl<sub>2</sub> + R<sub>2</sub>SnCl<sub>2</sub>

===Reduction===
Reduction of BCl<sub>3</sub> to elemental boron is conducted commercially (see below).  In the laboratory, when boron trichloride can be converted to diboron tetrachloride but heating with copper metal:<ref>{{cite book | author = Wartik, T.; Rosenberg, R.; Fox, W. B.;  | chapter = Diboron Tetrachloride | title = Inorganic Syntheses | year = 1967 | volume = 10 | pages = 118–125 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132418.ch18 }}</ref> 
:2 BCl3  + 2 Cu   →   B<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>  +  CuCl
B<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> can also be prepared in this way. Colourless diboron tetrachloride (m.p. -93 °C) is a planar molecule in the solid, (similar to [[dinitrogen tetroxide]], but in the gas phase the structure is staggered.<ref name = greenwood /> It decomposes at room temperatures to give a series of monochlorides having the general formula (BCl)<sub>''n''</sub>, in which ''n'' may be 8, 9, 10, or 11.  The compounds with formulas B<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub> and B<sub>9</sub>Cl<sub>9</sub> are known to contain closed cages of boron atoms.

==Uses==
Boron trichloride is a starting material for the production of elemental boron. It is also used in the [[refining]] of [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], zinc, and [[copper]] alloys to remove [[nitrides]], [[carbide]]s, and [[oxides]] from molten metal. It has been used as a soldering flux for alloys of aluminium, [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[tungsten]], and [[monel]]. Aluminum castings can be improved by treating the melt with boron trichloride vapors. In the manufacture of electrical resistors, a uniform and lasting adhesive [[carbon film]] can be put over a [[ceramic]] base using BCl<sub>3</sub>. It has been used in the field of high energy fuels and rocket propellants as a source of boron to raise BTU value. BCl<sub>3</sub> is also used in [[plasma etching]] in [[semiconductor]] manufacturing. This gas etches metal oxides by formation of a volatile BOCl<sub>x</sub> compounds.

BCl<sub>3</sub> is used as a [[reagent]] in the synthesis of organic compounds. Like the corresponding bromide, it cleaves C-O bonds in [[ether]]s.<ref name=EROS>{{cite encyclopedia | author = Yamamoto, Y.; Miyaura, N. | title = Boron Trichloride | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis | editor = Paquette, L. | year = 2004 | publisher = J. Wiley & Sons | location = New York | doi = 10.1002/047084289X.rb245.pub2 | isbn = 0471936235}}</ref>  

==Safety==
BCl<sub>3</sub> is an aggressive reagent that can form [[hydrogen chloride]] upon exposure to moisture or [[alcohol]]s. The [[dimethyl sulfide]] adduct BCl<sub>3</sub>SMe<sub>2</sub>), which is a solid, is much safer to use,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0040-4039(80)80164-X | title = Boron trihalide-methyl sulfide complexes as convenient reagents for dealkylation of aryl ethers | year = 1980 | last1 = Williard | first1 = Paul G. | last2 = Fryhle | first2 = Craig B. | journal = Tetrahedron Letters | volume = 21 | issue = 39 | pages = 3731}}</ref> when possible, but H<sub>2</sub>O will destroy the BCl<sub>3</sub> portion while leaving dimethyl sulfide in solution.
