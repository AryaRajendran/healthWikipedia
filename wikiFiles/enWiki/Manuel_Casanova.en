'''Manuel F. Casanova''' is the Gottfried and Gisela Kolb Endowed Chair in Outpatient [[Psychiatry]] and a Professor of Anatomical Sciences and [[Neurobiology]] at the [[University of Louisville]].

==Education and early career==

Casanova earned his medical degree from the [[University of Puerto Rico]].  He then completed clinical and research fellowships at [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], including three years in [[neuropathology]], where he was in-charge of pediatric [[neuropathology]], which was when his interest in developmental disorders of the [[brain]] arose.  He subsequently helped establish two [[brain bank]]s, the Johns Hopkins Brain Resource Center and the Brain Bank Unit of the Clinical Brains Disorders Branch at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH). 

Casanova spent several years as a deputy [[medical examiner]] for [[Washington, D.C.]], where he gained experience with the postmortem examination of [[sudden infant death syndrome]] and [[child abuse]], which was when he began publishing extensively on postmortem techniques, including neuronal morphometry immunocytochemistry, [[neurochemistry]], and autoradiography.  He also worked as a consultant and was staff [[neuropathologist]] at Sinai Hospital in [[Maryland]], the North Charles Hospital, and the D.C. General Hospital.  He is also a former lieutenant commander in the US [[Public Health Service]].  After serving  as a professor of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] at the [[Medical College of Georgia]], he subsequently joined the University of Louisville faculty.  

==Research==
Casanova's recent research projects have examined brain abnormalities in patients with language disturbances, including [[autism]], [[dyslexia]] and [[Asperger syndrome]].  His interest has gradually come to focus on abnormalities of cortical [[neurocircuit]]ry, in particular on the cell minicolumn, a vertical conglomerate of eighty to one hundred neurons that have in common a latency of response to stimulation.  Using computerized imaging analysis, he has established the anatomical validity of the cell minicolumn.  Casanova has reported interhemispheric differences in the morphometry of minicolumns that could provide explanations for the [[speciation]] of [[hominid]]s.  Localized in [[Brodmann area]] 22—part of [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke’s language region]]—the morphometric difference may play a role both in the development of language and in related disorders.

Casanova's most recent research studies have looked for abnormalities of minicolumnar organization and lateralization in the brains of patients who exhibit language disturbances, including [[autism]], Asperger syndrome, and [[dyslexia]].

His [[neuromorphology]] research, conducted in collaboration with other researchers from around the globe, has found there are drastic differences in the brains of [[autistic]] individuals.  He says the results of his recent studies, which show that minicolumns (or 'brain strands') of [[autism spectrum]] individuals have more cells, but they are narrower and more densely packed, which he says can limit the brain's ability to send messages.  This helps explain symptoms, says Casanova, since "there's not enough juice to actually power very long connections in the brain," adding that "It means that we have uncovered something very important, because it has explanatory powers."  A similar phenomenon involving [[spindle cell]] neurons is being investigated by

==Recognition==

His expertise in the field of postmortem techniques was recognized by honorary appointments as a Scientific Expert for the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]] and as a Professorial Lecturer for the Department of Forensic Science at [[George Washington University]].

==Personal Life==
Dr. Casanova has four daughters: Cristina, Sabrina, Belinda, and Aurora.
