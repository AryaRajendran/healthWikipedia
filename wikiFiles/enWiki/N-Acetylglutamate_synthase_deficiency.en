'''N-Acetylglutamate synthase deficiency''' is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[urea cycle disorder]].

==Mechanism==
[[Carbamoyl phosphate synthase I]] is an enzyme found in [[mitochondrial matrix]] and it catalyzes the very first reaction of the [[Urea cycle]], in which [[carbamoyl phosphate]] is produced. 

Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthase 1, abbreviated as CPS1, is activated by its natural activator [[N-Acetyl glutamate]], which in turn is synthesized from [[acetyl-CoA]] and [[glutamic acid]] in the reaction catalyzed by [[N-Acetyl glutamate synthase]], commonly called NAGS. N-Acetyl Glutamate is required for the [[Urea cycle]] to take place. 

Deficiency in N-Acetyl Glutamate Synthase or a genetic mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme, will lead to urea cycle failure in which [[ammonia]] is not converted to [[urea]], but rather accumulated in blood leading to the condition called '''Type I Hyperammonemia'''. This is a severe neonatal disorder with fatal consequences, if not detected immediately upon birth.

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|N-Acetylglutamate synthase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

The [[chromosome]] found to be carrying the [[gene]] encoding for N-Acetyl Glutamate synthetase is [[chromosome 17]]q ('''q''' stands for longer arm of the [[chromosome]]) in humans and chromosome 11 in mice. In both organisms, the chromosome consists of seven [[exons]] and six [[introns]] and non-coding [[sequence]]. 

[[Image:Geneprod.gif|450px|thumb|The figure shows human chromosome 17q and the coding region that encodes the NAGS enzyme. It has seven exons and six introns. The exons are shown as red squares.]]

The cause for this disorder is a single [[base pair|base]] deletion that led to [[frameshift mutation]], and thus the error in gene's coding for this specific [[enzyme]]. 

==Presentation and treatment==
The symptoms are visible within the first week of life and if not detected and diagnosed correctly immediately consequences are fatal. 

Although there is currently no cure, treatment includes injections of structurally similar compound, [[N-Carbamoyl-L-glutamate]], an analogue of N-Acetyl Glutamate. This analogue likewise activates [[Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I|CPS1]]. This treatment mitigates the intensity of the disorder. 

If symptoms are detected early enough and the patient is injected with this compound, levels of severe [[mental retardation]] can be slightly lessened, but [[brain damage]] is irreversible. 

Early symptoms include [[lethargy]], [[vomiting]], and deep [[coma]].
