'''Yorkshire Air Ambulance''' is a dedicated helicopter [[emergency service]] for  the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region of England. It was introduced on 1 April 2000, and currently operates two aircraft. The helicopters provide a swift response time and access to isolated locations, such as beaches, cliff-tops and moorland areas which are inaccessible by road.  The Yorkshire Air Ambulance is maintained by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance Trust, a [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|registered charity]].

Its original aircraft is based at [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] and has landing pads at various major hospitals around the region including [[Leeds General Infirmary]] and [[James Cook University Hospital]] in [[Middlesbrough]]. In October 2007 a second helicopter based at [[Sheffield City Airport]] entered service.<ref>

One helicopter (Helimed 99, registration G-SASH) is based at a hangar at [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] (EGNM), which enables servicing and maintenance to be carried out overnight, leading to even quicker response times in many parts of the county. It can be airborne in two minutes of a 999 call and flies at {{convert|140|mph|abbr=on}} enabling fast paramedic support to the patient.

The second YAA helicopter (Helimed 98, registration G-CEMS) was originally based at Sheffield City Airport but moved in March 2012 to [[RAF Topcliffe]] near [[Thirsk]]. A spokesman for the charity commented: "What we're looking to do is provide the very best coverage for the whole of Yorkshire, for the five million population.

"The people of Yorkshire are better served with an aircraft at Thirsk and one at Leeds Bradford."<ref name="Thirskmove"/>

==The aircraft==
The first helicopter was an [[MBB Bo 105]], but in 2005 they started using an [[MD Helicopters MD 902 Explorer|MD 902 Explorer]]. The Explorer is used extensively in an air ambulance capacity throughout the UK. It has five rotor blades to ensure a smooth flight which can prove particularly beneficial for patients suffering head or spinal injuries. Twin turbine engines give it a cruising speed of {{convert|160|mph|abbr=on}}, and skid landing gear allows it to cope with all types of terrain. Its compact dimensions allow it to land in confined spaces, yet it has room to carry one stretcher patient. It contains all equipment found on any front-line ambulance plus other special items.

==Cost and financing==
The Yorkshire Air Ambulance is a [[charitable organization]] solely maintained by donations as it receives no form of official funding. Medical and paramedic staff, however, are provided by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]]. The resident population and visitors to Yorkshire finance the Air Ambulance by donations, and various fund-raising events.
All donations received are administered by Yorkshire Air Ambulance Donation Office.

===Richard Hammond's incident 2006===
In September 2006 the original helicopter was involved in transporting the [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] presenter [[Richard Hammond]] following his high-speed accident at the former-[[RAF Elvington]] airfield near [[York]]. Following this operation a high profile charity appeal was launched, by 16 October contributions to the appeal have so far amounted to £185,770, although payment authorisation of one donation of £50,000 was "declined".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://justgiving.typepad.com/justgivings_blog/2006/09/richard_hammond.html|title=Why the Hammond fundraising total dropped|publisher=Justgiving blog|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref>
