The '''Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine''' was founded in 2009 by [[Donald Singer]], a clinical professor, and poet and translator [[Michael Hulse]]. The founders "wished to draw together national and international perspectives on three major historical and contemporary themes uniting the disciplines of poetry and medicine: medicine as inspiration for the writings of poets; effects of poetic creativity on the experience of illness by patients, their families, friends, and carers; and poetry as therapy".<ref name="pmid20333814">{{cite journal

==Background==
One award is given for UK health students and [[National Health Service]]-related professionals, including educators, researchers, and biomedical scientists. A second, the International Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine, is an international award for unpublished poems in English by any living poet. The International Hippocrates Prize for Young Poets<ref name="hippocrates-poetry.org">Website for international Hippocrates Prize for Young Poets. http://hippocrates-poetry.org/hippocrates-prize/2013-hippocrates-prize-for/</ref> was launched in 2012, also given for an unpublished poem on a medical theme.
