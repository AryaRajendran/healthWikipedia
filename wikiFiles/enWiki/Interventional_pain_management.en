==Radiation==

[[Radiotherapy]] is used when drug treatment is failing to control the pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought to be due to reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals.<ref name = Hoskin>{{ vcite book | author = Hoskin PJ | chapter = Radiotherapy | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 251–55 | year = 2008 }}</ref> [[Radiopharmaceutical]]s that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses.

[[Neurolysis]] is the injury of a nerve. Chemicals, laser, freezing or heating may be used to injure a sensory nerve and so produce degeneration of the nerve's fibers and the fibers' [[myelin sheath]]s, and temporary interference with the transmission of pain signals. In this procedure, the protective casing around the myelin sheath, the [[basal lamina]], is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber (and its myelin sheath) regrows, it travels within its basal lamina and connects with the correct loose end, and function may be restored. Surgical cutting of a nerve severs the basal laminae, and without these tubes to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, a [[neuromata]] may develop, causing deafferentation pain. This is why neurolysis is preferred over surgically blocking nerves.<ref name = Williams>{{vcite book | author = Williams JE | chapter = Nerve blocks: Chemical and physical neurolytic agents | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 225–35 | year = 2008 }}</ref> A brief "rehearsal" block using local anesthesia should be tried before the actual neurolytic block, to determine efficacy and detect side effects.<ref name = Atallah/> The aim of this treatment is pain elimination, or the reduction of pain to the point where opioids may be effective.<ref name = Atallah/> Though neurolysis lacks long-term outcome studies and evidence-based guidelines for its use, for patients with progressive cancer and otherwise incurable pain, it can play an essential role.<ref name = Williams/>

Targets for neurolytic block include the [[celiac plexus]], most commonly for cancer of the gastrointestinal tract up to the transverse colon, and pancreatic cancer, but also for stomach cancer, gall bladder cancer, adrenal mass, common bile duct cancer, chronic pancreatitis and active intermittent [[porphyria]]; the [[splanchnic nerve]], for retroperitoneal pain, and similar conditions to those addressed by the celiac plexus block but, because of its higher rate of complications, used only if the celiac plexus block is not producing adequate relief; [[Inferior hypogastric plexus|hypogastric plexus]], "for cancer affecting the descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum," as well as cancers of the bladder, prostatic urethra, prostate, seminal vesicles, testicles, uterus, ovary and vaginal fundus; [[ganglion impar]], for the perinium, vulva, anus, distal rectum, distal urethra, and distal third of the vagina; the [[stellate ganglion]], usually for head and neck cancer, or sympathetically mediated arm and hand pain; the [[intercostal nerves]], which serve the skin of the chest and abdomen; and a dorsal root ganglion may be injured by targeting the root inside the [[subarachnoid space|subarachnoid cavity]] ([[#fig. 5|fig.5]]), most effective for pain in the chest or abdominal wall, but also used for other areas including arm/hand or leg/foot pain.<ref name = Atallah/>

==Cutting or destruction of nervous tissue==

Surgical cutting or destruction of [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] or [[central nervous system|central]] nervous tissue is now rarely used in the treatment of pain.<ref name = Atallah/> Procedures include  neurectomy, cordotomy, dorsal root entry zone lesioning, and cingulotomy.

[[Neurectomy]] involves cutting a nerve, and is (rarely) used in patients with short life expectancy who are unsuitable for drug therapy due to ineffectiveness or intolerance. The [[dorsal root]] or [[dorsal root ganglion]] (that carry mostly sensory signals) may be usefully targeted (called [[rhizotomy]]); with the dorsal root ganglion possibly the more effective target because some sensory fibers enter the spinal cord from the dorsal root ganglion via the [[ventral root|''ventral'' (motor) root]], and these would not be interrupted by dorsal root neurectomy. Because nerves often carry both sensory and motor fibers, motor impairment is a possible side effect of neurectomy. A common result of this procedure is "deafferentation pain" where, 6–9 months after surgery, pain returns at greater intensity.<ref name = Cosgrove/>

[[Cordotomy]] involves cutting into the [[spinothalamic tract]]s, which run up the front/side (anterolateral) quadrant of the spinal cord, carrying heat and pain signals to the brain ([[#fig. 6|fig. 6]]). Pancoast tumor pain has been effectively treated with dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning&nbsp;– damaging a region of the spinal cord where peripheral pain signals cross to spinal cord fibers. This is major surgery, carrying the risk of significant neurological side effects. [[Cingulotomy]] involves cutting the fibers that carry signals directly from the [[cingulate gyrus]] to the [[entorhinal cortex]] in the brain. It reduces the unpleasantness of pain (without affecting its intensity), but may have [[cognition|cognitive]] side effects.<ref name = Cosgrove/>

==Intrathecal infusion==

{{main|Intrathecal pump}}
Delivery of an opioid such as [[morphine]], [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[sufentanyl]] or [[meperidine]] directly into the subarachnoid cavity ([[#fig. 5|fig. 5]]) provides enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects, and has reduced the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. The anxiolytic [[clonidine]], or the nonopioid analgesic [[ziconotide]], and local anesthetics such as [[bupivacaine]], [[ropivacaine]] or [[tetracaine]] may also be infused along with the opioid.<ref name = Atallah/><ref name = Cosgrove>{{vcite book | author = Cosgrove MA, Towns DK, Fanciullo GJ & Kaye AD | chapter = Interventional pain management | pages = 237–299 | editor = Vadivelu N, Urman RD, Hines RL | title = Essentials of pain management | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-387-87578-1 | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-87579-8 | year = 2011 }}</ref>

==Epidural infusion==

The outer layer of the sheath surrounding the spinal cord is called the [[dura mater]]. Between this and the surrounding [[vertebra]]e is the [[epidural space]], filled with connective tissue, fat and blood vessels, and crossed by the spinal nerve roots. A [[catheter]] may be inserted into this space for three to six months, to deliver anesthetics or analgesics. The line carrying the drug may be threaded under the skin to emerge at the front of the patient, a process called tunneling. This is recommended with long term use so as to reduce the chance of any infection at the exit site reaching the epidural space.<ref name = Atallah/>

==Spinal cord stimulation==

Electrical stimulation of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord ([[#fig. 6|fig. 6]]) can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by the patient's report and  [[fluoroscopy]], and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath the skin of the upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly-fitting generator.<ref name = Cosgrove/> It seems to be more helpful with [[pain#neuropathic|neuropathic]] and [[Ischemia|ischemic]] pain than [[pain#Nociceptive|nociceptive pain]], and is not often used in the treatment of cancer pain.<ref name = Johnson>{{ vcite book | author = Johnson MI, Oxberry SG & Robb K | chapter = Stimulation-induced analgesia | pages = 235–250 | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | year = 2008 }}</ref>

==Deep brain stimulation==

Ongoing electrical stimulation of structures deep within the brain&nbsp;– the [[periaqueductal gray]] and [[periventricular gray]] for nociceptive pain, and the [[internal capsule]], [[ventral posterolateral nucleus]] and [[ventral posteromedial nucleus]] for neuropathic pain&nbsp;– has produced impressive results with some patients but results vary and appropriate patient selection is important. One study<ref name = Young>{{vcite journal | author = Young RF & Brechner T | title = Electrical stimulation of the brain for relief of intractable pain due to cancer | journal = Cancer | volume = 57 | year = 1986 | pages = 1266–72 | pmid = 3484665}}</ref> of seventeen patients with intractable cancer pain found that thirteen were virtually painless and only four required opioid analgesics on release from hospital after the intervention. Most ultimately did resort to opioids, usually in the last few weeks of life.<ref name = Johnson/>

==Hypophysectomy==

[[Hypophysectomy]] is the destruction of the [[pituitary gland]], and has been used successfully on metastatic breast and prostate cancer pain.<ref name = Cosgrove/>
