Despite its lack of scientific acceptance, HIV/AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the presidency of [[Thabo Mbeki]].

==History==
In 1983, a group of scientists and doctors at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in France, led by [[Luc Montagnier]], discovered a new virus in a patient with signs and symptoms that often preceded AIDS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barré-Sinoussi F, Chermann J, Rey F, Nugeyre M, Chamaret S, Gruest J, Dauguet C, Axler-Blin C, Vézinet-Brun F, Rouzioux C, Rozenbaum W, Montagnier L |title=Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) |journal=Science |volume=220 |issue=4599 |pages=868–71 |year=1983 |pmid=6189183 |doi=10.1126/science.6189183 |bibcode=1983Sci...220..868B}}</ref> They named the virus ''lymphadenopathy-associated virus'', or LAV, and sent samples to [[Robert Gallo]]'s team in the United States. Their findings were [[peer reviewed]] and slated for publication in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.

At a 23 April 1984 press conference in Washington, D.C., [[Margaret Heckler]], Secretary of [[Health and Human Services]], announced that Gallo and his co-workers had discovered a virus that is the "probable" cause of AIDS. This virus was initially named HTLV-III.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sarngadharan MG, DeVico AL, Bruch L, Schüpbach J, Gallo RC |title=HTLV-III: the etiologic agent of AIDS |journal=Int. Symp. Princess Takamatsu Cancer Res. Fund |volume=15 |pages=301–8 |year=1984 |pmid=6100648 |url=}}</ref> That same year, Casper Schmidt responded to Gallo's papers with "The Group-Fantasy Origins of AIDS", ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schmidt C | title = The group-fantasy origins of AIDS | journal = J Psychohist | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–78 | year = 1984 | pmid = 11611586}}</ref> Schmidt posited that AIDS was not an actual disease, but rather an example of "[[epidemic hysteria]]" in which groups of people are subconsciously acting out social conflicts. Schmidt compared AIDS to documented cases of epidemic hysteria in the past which were mistakenly thought to be infectious. (Schmidt himself would later die of AIDS in 1994.)<ref>[[#Kalichman2009|Kalichman]], 2009, p.

In 1986, the viruses discovered by Montagnier and Gallo, found to be genetically indistinguishable, were renamed HIV.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coffin J, Haase A, Levy J, Montagnier L, Oroszlan S, Teich N, Temin H, Toyoshima K, Varmus H, Vogt P |title=What to call the AIDS virus? |journal=Nature |volume=321 |issue=6065 |page=10 |year= 1986|pmid=3010128 |doi=10.1038/321010a0|bibcode = 1986Natur.321...10. }}</ref> In 1987, [[Peter Duesberg]] questioned the link between HIV and AIDS in the journal ''[[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]]''.<ref name=duesberg1987>{{cite journal |author=Duesberg P |title=Retroviruses as carcinogens and pathogens: expectations and reality |journal=Cancer Res |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=1199–220 |year=1987 |pmid=3028606}}</ref> Duesberg's publication coincided with the start of major [[public health]] campaigns and the development of [[zidovudine]] (AZT) as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.

In 1988, a panel of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] found that "the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive."<ref name=iomreport>{{cite web | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=771&page=2 | title = Confronting AIDS: Update 1988 | publisher = [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] | year = 1988 | quote = …the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.}}</ref> That same year, ''Science'' published Blattner, Gallo, and Temin's ''HIV causes AIDS'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blattner W, Gallo RC, Temin HM |title=HIV causes AIDS |journal=Science |volume=241 |issue=4865 |pages=515–6 |year=1988 |month=July |pmid=3399881 |doi=10.1126/science.3399881 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/241/4865/515|bibcode = 1988Sci...241..515B }}</ref> and Peter Duesberg's ''HIV is not the cause of AIDS''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Duesberg P |title=HIV is not the cause of AIDS |journal=Science |volume=241 |issue=4865 |pages=514–514 |year=1988 |month=July |pmid=3399880 |doi=10.1126/science.3399880 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/241/4865/514|bibcode = 1988Sci...241..514D }}</ref> Also that same year, [[The Perth Group]], a group of denialists based in [[Perth, Western Australia]] led by [[Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos]],  published in the non-peer-reviewed journal ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'' their first article questioning aspects of HIV/AIDS research,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Papadopulos-EleopulosE|title=Reappraisal of AIDS – is the oxidation induced by the risk factors the primary cause?|journal=MedHypotheses|volume=25|issue=3|pages=151–62|year = 1988|pmid = 3285143|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(88)90053-9}}</ref> arguing that there was "no compelling reason for preferring the viral hypothesis of AIDS to one based on the activity of oxidising agents."

In 1989, Duesberg exercised his right, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, to bypass the peer review process and publish his arguments in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS) unreviewed. The editor of ''PNAS'' initially resisted, but ultimately allowed Duesberg to publish, saying: "If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader."<ref name=sciencebooth/> In 1990, [[Robert Root-Bernstein]] published his first peer-reviewed article detailing his objections to the mainstream view of AIDS and HIV.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Root-Bernstein R |title=Do we know the cause(s) of AIDS? |journal=Perspect Biol Med |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=480–500 |year=1990 |pmid=2216658}}</ref> In it, he questioned both the mainstream view and the "dissident" view as potentially inaccurate. In 1991, The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis, comprising twelve scientists, doctors, and activists, submitted a short letter to various journals, but the letter was rejected.

In 1993, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published an editorial arguing that Duesberg had forfeited his [[right of reply]] by engaging in disingenuous rhetorical techniques and ignoring any evidence that conflicted with his claims.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maddox J |title=Has Duesberg a right of reply? |journal=Nature |volume=363 |issue=6425 |page=109 |year=1993 |month=May |pmid=8483492 |doi=10.1038/363109a0 |bibcode=1993Natur.363..109M}}</ref> That same year, a trio of HIV/AIDS denialists alleged in the journal ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' (then edited by fellow denialist [[Harvey Bialy]]) that the [[Western blot]] test for HIV was not standardized, non-reproducible, and of unknown specificity due to a claimed lack of a "[[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]]".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Papadopulos-Eleopulos E, Turner VF, Papadimitriou JM |title=Is a positive western blot proof of HIV infection? |journal=Biotechnology (N.Y.) |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=696–707 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=7763673 |doi=10.1038/nbt0693-696 }}</ref> On 28 October 1994, [[Robert Willner]], a physician whose medical license had been revoked for, among other things, treating an AIDS patient with [[ozone therapy]], publicly jabbed his finger with blood he said was from an HIV-infected patient.<ref name=Cohen/> Willner died in 1995 of a heart attack.<ref>{{cite web  | last =Bugl  | first =Paul  | title =The Rise of HIV/AIDS  | publisher = Department of Mathematics, University of Hartford  | url =http://uhavax.hartford.edu/bugl/rise.htm  | accessdate =22 January 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070204142451/http://uhavax.hartford.edu/bugl/rise.htm| archivedate= 4 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> That same year, Continuum, a denialist group, placed an advertisement in the British gay and lesbian magazine ''[[Pink Paper|The Pink Paper]]'' offering a £1,000 reward to "the first person finding one scientific paper establishing actual isolation of HIV", according to a set of seven steps they claimed to have been drawn up by the Pasteur Institute in 1973.<ref name=isolatedFacts>{{cite journal | url = http://www.aegis.com/pubs/atu/1996/ATU4004.html | title = ISOLATED FACTS ABOUT HIV: A response to claims by AIDS dissidents that HIV doesn't exist  | last = King | first = E | journal = AIDS Treatment Update | volume = 40 | year = 1996 }}</ref> The challenge was later dismissed by various scientists, including Duesberg, asserting that HIV undoubtedly exists.<ref name = isolatedFacts/>

Early denialist arguments held that the HIV/AIDS paradigm was flawed because it had not led to effective treatments. However, the introduction of [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]] in the mid-1990s and dramatic improvements in survival of HIV/AIDS patients reversed this argument, as these treatments were based directly on anti-viral activity and the HIV/AIDS paradigm.<ref name="treatment-studies">Major studies confirming the benefits and effectiveness of modern anti-HIV therapy include, but are not limited to:

In a 2010 article on [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] in science, Ted Goertzel lists HIV/AIDS denialism as an example where scientific findings are being disputed on irrational grounds. He describes proponents as relying on [[rhetoric]], appeal to fairness, and the right to a dissenting opinion rather than on evidence.  They frequently invoke the [[meme]] of a "courageous independent scientist resisting orthodoxy", invoking the name of persecuted physicist and astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]].<ref name = Goertzel>{{cite pmid | 20539311}}</ref>  Regarding this comparison, Goertzel states:
{{quote|...being a dissenter from orthodoxy is not difficult; the hard part is actually having a better theory. Publishing dissenting theories is important when they are backed by plausible evidence, but this does not mean giving critics ‘equal time’ to dissent from every finding by a mainstream scientist.| Goertzel, 2010<ref name = Goertzel/>}}

==The HIV/AIDS denialist community==
Denialists often use their critique of the link between HIV and AIDS to promote [[alternative medicine]] as a cure, and attempt to convince HIV-infected individuals to avoid [[Antiretroviral drug|ARV therapy]] in favour of vitamins, massage, yoga and other unproven treatments.<ref name="nattrass-2007-si"/>  Despite this promotion, denialists will often downplay any association with alternative therapies, and attempt to portray themselves as "dissidents".  An article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' stated:
{{quote|AIDS denialists [prefer] to characterize themselves as brave "dissidents" attempting to engage a hostile medical/industrial establishment in genuine scientific "debate." They complain that their attempts to raise questions and pose alternative hypotheses have been unjustly rejected or ignored at the cost of scientific progress itself...Given their resistance to all evidence to the contrary, today’s AIDS dissidents are more aptly referred to as AIDS denialists.

She observed that despite being a disparate group of people with very different background and professions, the HIV/AIDS denialists self-organize to fill four important roles:<ref name=nattrass2012/>
*Hero scientists to provide scientific legitimacy: Most notably is [[Peter Duesberg]] who plays the central role of HIV/AIDS denialism from the beginning. Others include [[David Rasnick]], [[Etienne de Harven]], and [[Kary Mullis]] whose [[Nobel Prize]] makes him symbolically important.
*"Cultropreneurs" to offer fake cures in place of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]]: [[Matthias Rath]], [[Gary Null]], Michael Ellner, and Roberto Giraldo all promote [[alternative medicine]] and remedies with a dose of conspiracy theories in the form of books, healing products, radio shows and counseling services.
*HIV positive living icons to provide proof of concept by appearing to live healthily without antiretroviral therapy: [[Christine Maggiore]] was and still is the most important icon in the HIV/AIDS denialist movement despite the fact that she died of AIDS related complications in 2008.
*Praise singers: sympathetic journalists and filmmakers who publicize the movement with uncritical and favorable opinion. They include journalists [[Celia Farber]], [[Incarnation Children's Center|Liam Scheff]] and Neville Hodgkinson; filmmakers [[House of Numbers (2009 film)|Brent Leung]] and  [[The Other Side of AIDS|Robert Leppo]].
Some of them had overlapping roles as board members of Rethinking AIDS and [[Alive and Well AIDS Alternatives]], were involved in the film ''[[House of Numbers (2009 film)|House of Numbers]]'', ''[[The Other Side of AIDS]]'' or on [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s AIDS Advisory Panel.
Nattrass argued that HIV/AIDS denialism gains social traction through powerful community-building effects where these four organized characters form "a symbiotic connection between AIDS denialism and alternative healing modalities" and they are "facilitated by a shared conspiratorial stance toward HIV science".<ref name=nattrass2012/>

===Former denialists===
Several of the few prominent scientists who once voiced doubts about HIV/AIDS have since changed their views and accepted the fact that HIV plays a role in causing AIDS, in response to an accumulation of newer studies and data.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.aegis.com/topics/mdelaney.html | title = HIV, AIDS, and the Distortion of Science | first = M | last = Delaney | accessdate =9 June 2011 | year = 2005 | journal = [[Focus (Christian magazine)|Focus]] | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 1=6 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604155409/http://www.aegis.com/topics/mdelaney.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Robert Root-Bernstein]], author of ''Rethinking AIDS: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus'' and formerly a critic of the causative role of HIV in AIDS, has since distanced himself from the HIV/AIDS denialist movement, saying, "Both the camp that says HIV is a pussycat and the people who claim AIDS is all HIV are wrong...The denialists make claims that are clearly inconsistent with existing studies."<ref name=poz>{{cite web | url = http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml | title = Dead Certain? | last = Lederer | first = B | publisher = [[POZ (magazine)|POZ]] | date = 1 April 2006 | accessdate =31 October 2006 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061113150749/http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml| archivedate= 13 November 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Joseph Sonnabend]], who until the late 1990s regarded the issue of AIDS causation as unresolved, has reconsidered in light of the success of newer antiretroviral drugs, stating, "The evidence now strongly supports a role for HIV… Drugs that can save your life can also under different circumstances kill you. This is a distinction that denialists do not seem to understand."<ref name=poz/> Sonnabend has also criticized HIV/AIDS denialists for falsely implying that he supports their position, saying:
{{Quotation|Some individuals who believe that HIV plays no role at all in AIDS have implied that I support their misguided views on AIDS causation by including inappropriate references to me in their literature and on their web sites. Before HIV was discovered and its association with AIDS established, I held the entirely appropriate view that the cause of AIDS was then unknown. I have successfully treated hundreds of AIDS patients with antiretroviral medications, and have no doubt that HIV plays a necessary role in this disease.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/sonnabend | title = Statement by Joseph Sonnabend, M.D. | publisher = aidstruth.org | accessdate = 2011-02-15 }}</ref>}}

Both Sonnabend and Root-Bernstein now favor a less controversial hypothesis, suggesting that while HIV is necessary for AIDS, cofactors may also contribute.

==Impact beyond the scientific community==
AIDS-denialist claims have failed to attract support in the scientific community, where the evidence for the causative role of HIV in AIDS is considered conclusive. However, the movement has had a significant impact in the political sphere, culminating with former South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s embrace of AIDS-denialist claims. The resulting governmental refusal to provide effective anti-HIV treatment in South Africa has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of premature AIDS-related deaths in South Africa.<ref name="nyt-dugger">{{cite news|work=New York Times | first = Celia | last = Dugger | date = 25 November 2008 | accessdate =17 December 2008 | title = Study Cites Toll of AIDS Policy in South Africa | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/africa/26aids.html}}</ref>

===Impact in North America and Europe===
Skepticism about HIV being the cause of AIDS began almost immediately after the discovery of HIV was announced. One of the earliest prominent skeptics was the journalist John Lauritsen, who argued in his writings for the ''[[New York Native]]'' that AIDS was in fact caused by [[Poppers|amyl nitrite poppers]], and that the government had conspired to hide the truth.<ref>[http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/data2/jlbio.htm Biography of John Lauritsen] at Virusmyth.com, a dissident website. Retrieved 7 September 2006.</ref>

====In the scientific literature====
The publication of Peter Duesberg's first AIDS paper in 1987 provided visibility for denialist claims. Shortly afterwards, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reported that Duesberg's remarks had won him "a large amount of media attention, particularly in the gay press where he is something of a hero."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Booth W |title=A rebel without a cause of AIDS |journal=Science |volume=239 |issue=4847 |pages=1485–8 |year=1988 |month=March |pmid=3281251 |doi=10.1126/science.3281251 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/239/4847/1485 |bibcode = 1988Sci...239.1485B }}</ref> However, Duesberg's support in the [[gay community]] dried up as he made a series of statements perceived as [[homophobic]]; in an interview with the ''[[Village Voice]]'' in 1988, Duesberg stated his belief that the AIDS epidemic was "caused by a lifestyle that was criminal twenty years ago."<ref name=epstein>{{cite book |author=Epstein, Steven |title=Impure science: AIDS, activism, and the politics of knowledge |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1996 |isbn=0-520-20233-3 }}</ref><sup>, p.&nbsp;118</sup>

In the following few years, others became skeptical of the HIV theory as researchers initially failed to produce an effective treatment or vaccine for AIDS.<ref>Burkett, E (1996) The Gravest Show on Earth (Chapter 2) ISBN 0-312-14607-8</ref> Journalists such as Neville Hodgkinson and [[Celia Farber]] regularly promoted denialist ideas in the American and British media; several television documentaries were also produced to increase awareness of the alternative viewpoint.<ref>[http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/censorship.htm VirusMyth], a dissident website. Retrieved 2 June 2006.</ref> In 1992–1993, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', where Hodgkinson served as scientific editor, ran a series of articles arguing that the AIDS epidemic in Africa was a myth. These articles stressed Duesberg's claims and argued that antiviral therapy was ineffective, HIV testing unreliable, and that AIDS was not a threat to heterosexuals. The ''Sunday Times'' coverage was heavily criticized as slanted, misleading, and potentially dangerous; the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' took the unusual step of printing a 1993 editorial calling the paper's coverage of HIV/AIDS "seriously mistaken, and probably disastrous."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DD173EF933A25751C1A965958260 | title = British Paper and Science Journal Clash on AIDS | last = Schmidt | first = WE |work=The New York Times | date = 10 December 1993 | accessdate =25 April 2008 }}</ref>

Finding difficulty in publishing his arguments in the scientific literature, Duesberg exercised his right as a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] to publish in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS) without going through the [[peer review]] process. However, Duesberg's paper raised a "red flag" at the journal and was submitted by the editor for non-binding review. All of the reviewers found major flaws in Duesberg's paper; the reviewer specifically chosen by Duesberg noted the presence of "misleading arguments", "nonlogical statements", "misrepresentations", and political overtones.<ref name=sciencebooth>{{cite journal |author=Booth W |title=AIDS paper raises red flag at PNAS |journal=Science |volume=243 |issue=4892 |page=733 |year=1989 |pmid=2916121|doi=10.1126/science.2916121|bibcode = 1989Sci...243..733B }}</ref> Ultimately, the editor of PNAS acquiesced to publication,<ref name=pnas1989>{{cite journal |author=Duesberg PH |title=Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: correlation but not causation |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=755–64 |year=1989 |pmid=2644642 |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.3.755 |pmc=286556|bibcode = 1989PNAS...86..755D }}</ref> writing to Duesberg: "If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader."<ref name=sciencebooth/>

HIV/AIDS denialists often resort to [[special pleading]] to support their assertion, arguing for different causes of AIDS in different locations and subpopulations. In North America, AIDS is blamed on the health effects of unprotected anal sex and poppers on homosexual men, an argument which does not account for AIDS in drug-free heterosexual women who deny anal sex.  In this case, HIV/AIDS denialists claim the women are having anal sex but refuse to disclose it. In [[haemophilia]]c North American children who contracted AIDS from blood transfusions, the hemophilia itself or its treatment is claimed to cause AIDS.  In Africa, AIDS is blamed on poor nutrition and sanitation due to poverty.  For wealthy populations in South Africa with adequate nutrition and sanitation, it is claimed that the antiretroviral drugs used to treat AIDS causes the condition.  In each case, the [[Occam's razor|most parsimonious explanation]] and uniting factor – HIV positive status – is ignored, as are the thousands of studies that converge on the common conclusion that AIDS is caused by HIV infection.<ref name = Kalichmanbook/>

Haemophilia is considered the best test of the HIV-AIDS hypothesis by both denialists and scientists.  While Peter Duesberg claims AIDS in haemophiliacs is caused by contaminated clotting factors and HIV is a harmless [[passenger virus]], this result is contradicted by large studies on haemophiliac patients who received contaminated blood.  A comparison of groups receiving high, medium and low levels of contaminated clotting factors found the death rates differed significantly depending on HIV status.  Of 396 HIV positive haemophiliacs followed between 1985 and 1993, 153 died.  The comparative figure for the HIV negative group was one out of 66, despite comparable doses of contaminated clotting factors.  A comparison of individuals receiving blood donations also supports the results; in 1994 there were 6888 individuals with AIDS who had their HIV infection traced to blood transfusions.  Since the introduction of HIV testing, the number of individuals whose AIDS status can be traced to blood transfusions was only 29 (as of 1994).<ref name = CohenScience1994/>

==== In lay press and on the Internet ====
With the introduction of [[HAART|highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART) in 1996–1997, the survival and general health of people with HIV improved significantly.<ref name="treatment-studies"/><ref>HIV treatment response and prognosis in Europe and North America in the first decade of highly active antiretroviral therapy: a collaborative analysis.  May MT, Sterne JA, et al.,  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16890831</ref> The positive response to treatment with anti-HIV medication cemented the scientific acceptance of the HIV/AIDS paradigm, and led several prominent HIV/AIDS denialists to accept the causative role of HIV.<ref name=jme/><ref name=poz/> Finding their arguments increasingly discredited by the scientific community, denialists took their message to the popular press. A former denialist wrote:{{Quotation|Scientists among the HIV dissidents used their academic credentials and academic affiliations to generate interest, sympathy, and allegiances in lay audiences. They were not professionally troubled about recruiting lay people—who were clearly unable to evaluate the scientific validity or otherwise of their views—to their cause.<ref name=jme/>}}
In addition to elements of the popular and alternative press, AIDS denialist ideas are propagated largely via the Internet.<ref name=deer>Deer, Brian (21 February 2012) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/21/death-denial-hiv-aids?INTCMP=SRCH "Death by denial: The campaigners who continue to deny HIV causes Aids"]. ''The Guardian'' (UK),.</ref>

A 2007 article in ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'' noted:
{{Quotation|Because these denialist assertions are made in books and on the Internet rather than in the scientific literature, many scientists are either unaware of the existence of organized denial groups, or believe they can safely ignore them as the discredited fringe. And indeed, most of the HIV deniers' arguments were answered long ago by scientists. However, many members of the general public do not have the scientific background to critique the assertions put forth by these groups, and not only accept them but continue to propagate them.<ref name=SmithNovella>{{cite journal

AIDS activists have expressed concern that denialist arguments about HIV's harmlessness may be responsible for an upsurge in HIV infections. Denialist claims continue to exert a significant influence in some communities; a survey conducted at minority gay pride events in four American cities in 2005 found that 33% of attendees doubted that HIV caused AIDS.<ref>Hutchinson A.B., Begley E.B. et al. (2005) [http://www.aegis.org/conferences/nhivpc/2005/TP-011.html Mistrust and Conspiracy Beliefs about HIV/AIDS among Participants in Minority Gay Pride Events]. ''2005 National HIV Prevention Conference'' '''Abstract TP-011'''</ref> According to Stephen Thomas, director of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] [[Center for Minority Health]], "people are focusing on the wrong thing. They’re focusing on conspiracies rather than protecting themselves, rather than getting tested and seeking out appropriate care and treatment."<ref name=newsweekfrance>France, David (19 August 2000). "The HIV Disbelievers" ''[[Newsweek]]''.</ref>

===Impact in South Africa===
HIV/AIDS denialist claims have had a major political, social, and public health impact in South Africa. The government of then President [[Thabo Mbeki]] was sympathetic to the views of HIV/AIDS denialists, with critics charging that denialist influence was responsible for the slow and ineffective governmental response to the country's massive [[AIDS epidemic]].

Independent studies have arrived at almost identical estimates of the human costs of HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa. According to a paper written by researchers from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], between 2000 and 2005, more than 330,000 deaths and an estimated 35,000 infant HIV infections occurred "because of a failure to accept the use of available [antiretroviral drugs] to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS in a timely manner."<ref name=chigwedere/> Nicoli Nattrass of the [[University of Cape Town]] estimates that 343,000 excess AIDS deaths and 171,000 infections resulted from the Mbeki administration's policies, an outcome she refers to in the words of [[Peter Mandelson]] as "genocide by sloth".<ref name=NattrassAA/>

====Durban Declaration====
In 2000, when the [[International AIDS Conference]] was held in [[Durban]], Mbeki convened a Presidential Advisory Panel containing a number of HIV/AIDS denialists, including [[Peter Duesberg]] and [[David Rasnick]].<ref name=journaids>[http://www.journaids.org/politicsofhiv.php "The Politics of HIV/AIDS in South Africa"]: a Journ-AIDS Fact Sheet. Retrieved 26 February 2007.</ref> The Advisory Panel meetings were closed to the general press; an invited reporter from the ''[[Village Voice]]'' wrote that Rasnick advocated that HIV testing be legally banned and denied that he had seen "any evidence" of an AIDS catastrophe in South Africa, while Duesberg "gave a presentation so removed from African medical reality that it left several local doctors shaking their heads."<ref name=vv/>

In his address to the International AIDS Conference, Mbeki reiterated his view that HIV was not wholly responsible for AIDS, leading hundreds of delegates to walk out on his speech.<ref name=Controversy>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm "Controversy dogs AIDS forum], from the [[BBC]]. Accessed 26 February 2007.</ref> Mbeki also sent a letter to a number of world leaders likening the mainstream AIDS research community to supporters of the [[apartheid]] regime.<ref name=journaids/> The tone and content of Mbeki's letter led diplomats in the U.S. to initially question whether it was a hoax.<ref>Schoof, Mark ( 5–11 July2000).

AIDS scientists and activists were dismayed at the president's behavior and responded with the [[Durban Declaration]], a document affirming that HIV causes AIDS, signed by over 5,000 scientists and physicians.<ref name=durbandec/><ref name=Controversy/>

====Criticism of governmental response====
The former South African health minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]] also attracted heavy criticism, as she often promoted nutritional remedies such as garlic, lemons, [[beetroot]] and [[olive oil]], to people suffering from AIDS,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.health-e.org.za/news/article.php?uid=20031487 | title = Beetroot battle at world AIDS conference | first = Anso | last = Thom | publisher = Health-e | date = 21 August 2006 | accessdate=9 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/&articleid=280903 | title = 'Dr Beetroot' hits back at media over Aids exhibition | work = Mail & Guardian | accessdate =20 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aegis.com/news/sapa/2005/sa050604.html | title = Manto again angers AIDS activists | publisher = AEGIS.com | accessdate =20 September 2006}}</ref> while emphasizing possible toxicities of antiretroviral drugs, which she has referred to as "poison".<ref name=asg>{{cite web | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/nattrass.pdf | title = AIDS, Science and Governance | format = PDF | first = Nicoli | last = Nattrass | publisher = aidstruth.org}}</ref> The [[South African Medical Association]] has accused Tshabalala-Msimang of "confusing a vulnerable public".<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.samedical.org/article.asp?ArticleID=1844 | title = SAMA calls for end to misrepresentation on treatment of AIDS | date = 29 August 2006 | publisher = [[South African Medical Association]] | accessdate =12 March 2007}}</ref> In September 2006, a group of over 80 scientists and academics called for "the immediate removal of Dr. Tshabalala-Msimang as minister of health and for an end to the disastrous, pseudoscientific policies that have characterized the South African government's response to HIV/AIDS."<ref name=wpleonard>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090600586.html | title = Scientists Rip S.

Former South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s government was widely criticized for delaying the rollout of programs to provide antiretroviral drugs to people with advanced HIV disease and to HIV-positive pregnant women. The national treatment program began only after the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] (TAC) brought a legal case against Government ministers, claiming they were responsible for the deaths of 600 HIV-positive people a day who could not access medication.<ref name=journaids/><ref>[http://www.tac.org.za/Documents/MTCTCourtCase/MTCTCourtCase.htm Current Developments Preventing Mother-To-Child HIV Transmission In South Africa: Background, Strategies And Outcomes Of The Treatment Action Campaign Case Against The Minister Of Health]</ref> South Africa was one of the last countries in the region to begin such a treatment program, and roll-out has been much slower than planned.<ref name=asg/>

At the [[XVI International AIDS Conference]], [[Stephen Lewis]], UN special envoy for AIDS in Africa, attacked Mbeki's government for its slow response to the AIDS epidemic and reliance on denialist claims:
{{Quotation|It [South Africa] is the only country in Africa … whose government is still obtuse, dilatory and negligent about rolling out treatment… It is the only country in Africa whose government continues to promote theories more worthy of a lunatic fringe than of a concerned and compassionate state.<ref name=wpleonard/>}}

In 2002, Mbeki requested that HIV/AIDS denialists no longer use his name in denialist literature, and requested that denialists stop signing documents with "Member of President Mbeki's AIDS Advisory Panel".<ref name=journaids/> This coincided with the South African government's statement accompanying its 2002 AIDS campaign, that "...in conducting this campaign, government’s starting point is based on the premise that HIV causes AIDS".<ref>[http://www.avert.org/aids-south-africa.htm AIDS in South Africa: treatment, transmission and the government<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nonetheless, Mbeki himself continued to promote and defend AIDS-denialist claims. His loyalists attacked former President [[Nelson Mandela]] in 2002 when Mandela questioned the government's AIDS policy, and Mbeki attacked [[Malegapuru Makgoba]], one of South Africa's leading scientists, as a racist defender of "Western science" for opposing HIV/AIDS denialism.<ref name="nyt-dugger"/>

In early 2005, former South African president [[Nelson Mandela]] announced that his son had died of complications of AIDS. Mandela's public announcement was seen as both an effort to combat the stigma associated with AIDS, and as a "political statement designed to… force the President [Mbeki] out of his denial."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015842,00.html "No Place for Denial"], by Simon Robinson.

==== Post Mbeki government in South Africa ====
In 2008, Mbeki was ousted from power and replaced as President of South Africa by [[Kgalema Motlanthe]]. On Motlanthe's first day in office, he removed [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]], the controversial health minister who had promoted AIDS-denialist claims and recommended garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice as treatments for AIDS. [[Barbara Hogan]], newly appointed as health minister, voiced shame at the Mbeki government's embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism and vowed a new course, stating: "The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa."<ref name="nyt-dugger"/>
