The '''ST2 cardiac biomarker''' is a novel [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]] of [[Cardiac muscle|cardiac]] stress. ST2 signals the presence and severity of adverse cardiac remodeling and tissue [[fibrosis]], which occurs in response to [[myocardial infarction]], [[acute coronary syndrome]], or worsening [[heart failure]].<ref name="pmid20425491">{{cite journal | author = Shah RV, Januzzi JL | title = ST2: a novel remodeling biomarker in acute and chronic heart failure | journal = Curr Heart Fail Rep | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–14 | year = 2010 | month = March | pmid = 20425491 | doi = 10.1007/s11897-010-0005-9 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19017513">{{cite journal | author = Rehman SU, Mueller T, Januzzi JL | title = Characteristics of the novel interleukin family biomarker ST2 in patients with acute heart failure | journal = J.

== Protein ==
{{main|IL1RL1}}
ST2 is a member of the interleukin 1 receptor family. The ST2 protein has two isoforms and is directly implicated in the progression of cardiac disease: a soluble form (referred to as soluble ST2 or sST2) and a membrane-bound receptor form (referred to as the ST2 receptor or ST2L). The ligand for ST2 is the cytokine Interleukin-33(IL-33). Binding of IL-33 to the ST2 receptor, in response to cardiac disease or injury, such as an ischemic event, elicits a cardioprotective effect resulting in preserved cardiac function.  This cardioprotective IL-33 signal is counterbalanced by the level of soluble ST2, which binds IL-33 and makes it unavailable to the ST2 receptor for cardioprotective signaling. As a result, the heart is subjected to greater stress in the presence of high levels of soluble ST2.

== Correlation with mortality ==

==Patients with ACS==

ST2 is a strong predictor of cardiovascular death and risk of developing new heart failure in [[STEMI|ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction]] (STEMI) & [[Acute coronary syndrome|NSTE-ACS]] patients. In patients presenting with [[Acute coronary syndrome|Acute Coronary Syndrome]] (ACS), those in the highest quartile (above 35&nbsp;ng/ml) have more than 3 times higher risk of cardiovascular death and new heart failure at 30 days, than those in the lower quartiles. At one year, there is a [[relative risk]] of 2.3 for adverse outcomes.<ref name="urlClinical Chemistry Role of ST2 in Non-ST">{{cite web | url = http://www.clinchem.org/content/58/1/257.abstract | title = Role of ST2 in Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 Trial | author = P Kohli | date = | work = | publisher =  Clinical Chemistry | accessdate = }}</ref>
