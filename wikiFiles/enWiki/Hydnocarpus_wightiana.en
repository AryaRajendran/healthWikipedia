'''''Hydnocarpus wightiana''''' or '''Chaulmoogra''' is a tree in the [[Achariaceae]] family. The oil from its seeds has been widely used in [[Indian traditional medicine|Indian medicine]] and [[Chinese traditional medicine]] for the treatment of [[leprosy]]. It entered early Western medicine in the nineteenth century before the era of sulfones and antibiotics for the treatment of several skin diseases and [[leprosy]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=SA|title=Useful plants of dermatology.

==Physical characteristics and composition==
The oil is semi-solid at room temperature and does not have a strong odour. [[Gas-liquid chromatography]] analysis has shown the oil to contain the following fatty acids - hydnocarpic acid, chaulmoogric acid, gorlic acid, lower [[Cyclic homology|cyclic homologues]], [[myristic acid]], [[palmitic acid]], [[stearic acid]], [[palmitoleic acid]], [[oleic acid]], [[linoleic acid]] and [[linolenic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=A.|coauthors=Gupta, J.

The active ingredient that produces antimicrobial activity has been identified as hydnocarpic acid, a [[lipophilic]] compound. It acts by being an [[Antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonist]] of [[biotin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=PL|coauthors=Levy, L|title=Mechanism by which hydnocarpic acid inhibits mycobacterial multiplication.|journal=Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy|date=1973 Mar|volume=3|issue=3|pages=373–9|pmid=4799554|pmc=444418}}</ref> The oil was used intravenously or intramuscularly in the early part of the twentiety century against leprosy. An ethyl [[ester]] of the oil was prepared by [[Burroughs Wellcome]] and marketed in the early 1920s. This was also used intravenously for leprosy patients often producing local reactions. The oil was also often obtained directly from India by several doctors in Africa, such as the [[East African Rift]]. The doctors would locally prepare ethyl esters to treat their patients. In June 1927, [[Burroughs Wellcome]] released the commercial preparation, sodium hydnocarate marketed as Alepol, which produced lesser disagreeable symptoms of pain, swelling, irritating cough and blocking of the veins. In May 1928, doctors reported cure of leprosy in some patients after treatment with alepol <ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpkin|first=Alice|title=The Treatment of Leprosy|journal=British Journal of Nursing|year=1928|month=December|pages=313–4|url=http://www.leprosyhistory.org/cgi-bin/showdetails.pl?ID=437&type=lep|accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> 

The oil contains 5′-methoxyhydnocarpin, an [[amphipathic]] weak acid.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ranganathan|first=KR|coauthors=Seshadri T R|journal=Indian Journal of Chemistry|year=1974|volume=12|pages=993}}</ref> Although a minor component in the oil with no antimicrobial activitiy on its own, it plays a role in preventing [[multidrug resistance]] among some bacteria such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. It potentiates the action of [[berberine]] by preventing its removal from within bacteria thus leading to accumulation of berberine in the cells. Several ''berberis'' medicinal plants producing berberine also synthesize an inhibitor of the multidrug resistance pump of a human pathogen ''Staphylococcus aureus''. Berberine alkaloids, which are [[cationic]] antimicrobials produced by a variety of plants, are readily extruded by multidrug resistance pumps. They are constituents of several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[herbal medicine]] preparations.<ref name=pnas>{{cite journal|last=Stermitz|first=F.

In view of its anti-[[mycobacterium|mycobacterial]] activity, it has also been tried on other conditions caused by mycobacteria such as [[tuberculosis|tuberculous laryngitis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lukens|first=RM|title=CHAULMOOGRA OIL IN THE TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOUS LARYNGITIS|journal=JAMA|year=1922|volume=78|issue=4|pages=274–275|doi=10.1001/jama.1922.02640570018009|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/78/4/274.short}}</ref>
