'''Endoexoenteric''' refers to a specific [[radiographic]] manifestation of lymphoma of the bowel.

==Lymphoma==
[[Lymphomas]] are malignant neoplasms (cancers) arising from [[lymphocytes]] of the immune system. When they arise in the bowel tissue, they are referred to as primary. In other instances, the tumor can arise from the lymph nodes and "travel" to the bowel, so-called "extra-nodal" disease.

=="Endoexoenteric"==

=== Origin of Term ===
Marshak <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Richard |year=1961 |title=Roentgen findings in lesions of the small bowel| journal= Journal Digestive Diseases and Sciences|volume=6| issue=11|pages=1084–1114|doi=10.1007/BF02231137 }}</ref> was the first to introduce the term "endoexoenteric" to refer to a specific radiographic pattern (seen on [[x-rays]], [[CT scans]] or [[PET scans]]) of lymphomatous involvement of the bowel. This terminology derives from the fact that in this form of lymphomatous invasion of the bowel, the tumor extends throughout the entire width of the bowel wall, from the [[luminal]]  or [[mucosal]] (endo) surface to the [[serosal]] (exo) surface. Enteric refers to the bowel itself. Interestingly, in Marshak's later textbook, published in 1980,<ref>{{cite book |title=Radiology of the Colon |last=Marshak et al |year=1980 |publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |isbn=0-7216-6129-7 }}</ref> he abandons this terminology.

===Presentation===
Of the five patterns of bowel lymphoma described in Marshak's original work, endoexoenteric is the second most common type (the others being: infiltrative [most common], multiple nodules, polypoidal mass, and mesenteric.) <ref>{{cite book |title=Diagnostic Radiology: Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Imaging  |last=Berry |coauthors=Suri, Sudha |year=2008 |publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd |location= |isbn=978-81-8061-228-2 |page= |pages=109–120}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wyatt |first1=Susan H. |last2=Fishman |first2=Elliot K. |last3=Jones |first3=Bronwyn |year=1993 |title=Primary lymphoma of the colon and rectum: CT and barium enema correlation  |journal=Journal Abdominal Imaging |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=376–380|doi=10.1007/BF00201787  }}

===Features===
Specifically, the features of endoexoenteric lymphoma are an irregular collection of barium due to central ulceration, and displacement of adjacent bowel loops. In this form of lymphoma, [[fistula]]  formation (an abnormal communication between the tumor and adjacent bowel loops) is common. Since the bowel is not sterile, infection can easily be introduced, leading to findings of [[mesenteric]] abscesses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ghai |first1=Sangeet |last2=Pattison |first2=John |title=Primary Gastrointestinal Lymphoma: Spectrum  of Imaging Findings with Pathologic Correlation |journal=RadioGraphics |year=2007 |volume=27 |pages=1371–1388 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gollub |first1=M. |year=2008 |title=Imaging of Gastrointestinal Lymphoma |journal=Radiologic Clinics of North America |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=287–312 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Imaging techniques, while very helpful in suggesting the presence of specific disease, cannot diagnose this (or any other [[neoplastic]] disease) with certainty. Definitive diagnosis is almost always achieved by [[biopsy]], followed by [[microscopic]], [[histologic]] and [[immunologic]] examination of the tissues obtained.

==Significance==
Recognition of this type of lymphoma presentation is important, in that it may predict the future course and potential complications of this disease, thereby alerting clinicians to undertake surveillance and appropriate interventions.
