== History ==
Covance's origins go back to 1968, when Environmental Sciences Corporation – which manufactured equipment related to laboratory animals – opened for business in the basement of a former grocery store in Seattle, Washington. In 1972 it purchased and took the name of Hazleton Laboratories, a contract laboratory that conducted [[toxicology testing]]. In 1977 [[Corning Inc.|Corning Glass Works]] purchased a stake in Hazleton. According to material on the Funding Universe website, by 1982 Hazleton had become the largest independent biological testing company and life sciences laboratory in the United States, as well as the largest manufacturer of laboratory equipment in the world. The company carried out toxicology tests on animals of drugs, cosmetics, pesticides, and industrial chemicals, and bred [[rhesus monkey]]s and [[beagle]]s for its own labs, as well as for chemical and drug companies, hospitals, universities and government agencies. Funding Universe writes that it also offered chemical analysis of new compound products for various industries, tested chemicals for gene mutations, and carried out research with [[monoclonal antibodies]].<ref name=funding>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Covance-Inc-company-History.html "Covance History"], fundinguniverse.com; taken from Derdak, Thomas and Pederson, Jay P. ''International Directory of Company Histories''. St. James Press, 2000, Volume 30.

In 1989 Corning Glass Works purchased G.H. Besselaar Associates, which conducted clinical trials to help drugs gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration, and Hazleton purchased Microtest Ltd., a molecular toxicology center in York, England. Corning Glass Works then changed its name to Corning, and created Corning Lab Services, which included Besselaar and Hazelton. In 1991 and 1992 Corning Lab Services acquired SciCor and Philadelphia Association of Clinical Trials; in 1993 Hazleton, Besselaar, and SciCor were combined, becoming Corning Pharmaceutical Services, then Corning Life Sciences. In April 1996 Corning spun off its lab testing and pharmaceutical services, creating two new companies, [[Quest Diagnostics]] and Covance, the latter with a head office in Princeton, New Jersey. By 1998 Covance had net revenues of $731.6 million and a net income of $48.6 million.<ref name=funding/> By 2012 it had annual revenues of over $2 billion, and over 11,000 employees in more than 60 countries.<ref name=about/>

===Ebola virus===
In December 1989 a number of [[Crab-eating macaque|cynomolgus macaques]] (''Macaca fascicularis'') were imported from [[Mindanao|Mindanao Island]] in the Philippines with the [[Ebola virus]] to Covance's Hazleton Research Products' Primate Quarantine Unit in [[Reston, Virginia]]. The company was using monkeys there to [[Testing cosmetics on animals|test cosmetics]] and drugs, according to ''The Washington Post''. The virus was confirmed in one monkey and suspected in others among a group of 100.<ref>Cohn, D'Vera. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1225983.html "Deadly Ebola Virus Found In Va. Laboratory Monkey;Animals Sent to Reston From Philippines"], ''The Washington Post'', December 1, 1989.</ref> In March 1996 two macaques that had been shipped to Hazleton in Alice, Texas, tested positive for the Ebola virus from a group of 100 obtained from the same supplier.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070227204303/http://www.tdh.texas.gov/news/b_news69.htm "TDH Schedules Briefing on Investigation into Monkeys with Ebola"], Texas Department of State Health Services, April 15, 1996.

<!--=== LD50 tests ===
Documents obtained from Hazleton in Yorkshire in 1984 by animal rights activists offered information about [[LD50]] tests the company conducted on rabbits in 1980, which reportedly showed that [[paraquat]] was applied to the intact and [[Abrasion (medical)|abraded]] skin of [[New Zealand rabbit|New Zealand white rabbits]]. The animals were said to have had difficulty breathing, some were unable to move, and some suffered from anal bleeding and bleeding from the penis. Former research chemist Robert Sharpe writes that, in the early 1980s, Hazleton in Harrogate stated that they had expertise in “non-standard” tests in the field of inhalation-testing and explosive gases, and used "non-standard" animal models, such as [[Japanese Quail|Japanese]] and [[Northern Bobwhite|Bobwhite Quails]], Light Sussex Hens, Ring Necked Pheasants and Starlings, Rainbow Trout, Mirror Carp and Fathead minnows.<ref name="Sharpe">Sharpe, R.

===Allegations of primate abuse===

==== Münster, Germany ====
[[Image:Covance Undercover 1.jpeg|right|thumb|180px|Photograph taken by Friedrich Mülln for the [[BUAV]] inside Covance, Münster, 2003]]
In 2003 the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) sent a German investigative journalist, Friedrich Mülln, into the Covance facility in [[Münster]], Germany's largest primate-testing center, where he filmed undercover for five months.<ref name=Schiermeier>Schiermeier, Quirin. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6969/full/427004a.html "Primate lab faces closure threat over mistreatment charge"], ''Nature'', 427, 4, January 1, 2004.</ref>

The footage was shown on German public television in December 2003. ''Nature'' reported that it showed animal keepers dancing with half-anaesthetized monkeys, making their heads move to the rhythm of the music.<ref name=Schiermeier/> It also showed staff handling the monkeys roughly and shouting at them. The monkeys were seen living isolated in small wire cages with little or no natural light and no environmental enrichment, with high noise levels caused by staff shouting and playing the radio, and undergoing surgery with no post-operative care.<ref name="BUAVCovanceVideo">[http://www.peta.org/tv/videos/animal-experimentation/680085455001.aspx "Covance: Footage banned from British website"], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, hosted by PETA, accessed April 26, 2012.

The company also said there was group housing and pair housing for some monkeys, but the BUAV chose not to show that. Covance said they planned to upgrade the housing to comply with future European Union guidelines.<ref name="ebra" />

[[Jane Goodall]], a primatologist, described the monkeys' living conditions as horrendous. Another primatologist, Stephen Brend, argued that using monkeys in such a stressed state was "bad science," and that trying to extrapolate useful data in such circumstances was an "untenable proposition."<ref name="BUAVCovanceVideo" /> The environment minister for North Rhine-Westphalia asked the public prosecutor to investigate, and said that if the allegations were borne out, the company would lose its licence to keep primates.<ref name=Schiermeier/> According to the European Biomedical Research Association, a lobby group, the authorities inspected Covance and insisted that the company install video cameras to monitor staff working with primates. Covance appealed through the courts, which ruled that video monitoring would infringe the rights of the staff. The public prosecutor's office viewed the film and questioned witnesses, and concluded that Covance "had not rendered themselves liable to prosecution" and that the state veterinary officer "had not failed in his supervisory duties."<ref name="ebra">European Biomedical Research Association.

Covance announced in March 2006 that inspections by the Food & Drug Administration had "resulted in no findings to substantiate any claims made against the facility." Inspections by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) resulted in 16 citations in April 2006. The USDA declined to give details; according to Covance the violations ranged from "administrative issues to scope of veterinary authority." The company agreed to pay a settlement of $8,720.<ref>Pfister, Bonnie. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-121130175.html "Firm fined $8,720 after PETA video"], Associated Press, April 1, 2006.
