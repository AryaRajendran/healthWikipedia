'''Adhesions''' are [[fibrous]] bands<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000001769|adhesion}}</ref>  that form between tissues and organs, often as a result of injury during surgery.  They may be thought of as internal [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]] that connect tissues not normally connected.

==Pathophysiology==
Adhesions form as a natural part of the body’s healing process after [[surgery]] in the same way that a [[scar]] forms. The term "adhesion" is applied when the scar extends from within one tissue across to another, usually across a virtual space such as the [[peritoneal cavity]]. As part of the process, the body deposits [[fibrin]] onto injured tissues. The fibrin acts like a [[glue]] to seal the injury and builds the fledgling adhesion, said at this point to be "fibrinous." In body cavities such as the peritoneal, [[pericardial cavity|pericardial]] and [[synovial cavity|synovial cavities]], a family of fibrinolytic [[enzyme]]s may act to limit the extent of the initial fibrinous adhesion, and may even dissolve it. In many cases however the production or activity of these enzymes are compromised because of injury, and the fibrinous adhesion persists. If this is allowed to happen, tissue repair cells such as [[macrophage]]s, [[fibroblast]]s and [[blood vessel]] cells, penetrate into the fibrinous adhesion, and lay down collagen and other matrix substances to form a permanent fibrous adhesion. In 2002, Giuseppe Martucciello's research group showed a possible role could be played by microscopic foreign bodies (FB) accidentally contaminating the operative field during surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Torre M, Favre A, Pini Prato A, Brizzolara A, Martucciello G |title=Histologic study of peritoneal adhesions in children and in a rat model |journal=Pediatr. Surg. Int. |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=673–6 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12598961 |doi=10.1007/s00383-002-0872-6 }}</ref> These data suggested that two different stimuli are necessary for adhesion formation: a direct lesion of the mesothelial layers and a solid substrate (FB).  

While some adhesions do not cause problems, others can prevent [[muscle]] and other tissues and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s from moving freely, sometimes causing organs to become twisted or pulled from their normal positions.

==Regions affected==
===Adhesive capsulitis===
In the case of [[adhesive capsulitis of shoulder|adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder]] (also known as frozen shoulder), adhesions grow between the [[shoulder]] [[joint]] surfaces, restricting [[Anatomical position|motion]].

===Abdominal adhesions===
'''Abdominal adhesions''' (or '''intra-abdominal adhesions''') are most commonly caused by abdominal surgical procedures. The adhesions start to form  within hours after surgery and may cause internal organs to attach to the surgical site or to other organs in the abdominal cavity. Adhesion-related twisting and pulling of internal organs can result in complications such [[abdominal pain]] or intestinal obstruction. Small [[bowel obstruction]] (SBO) is a significant consequence of post-surgical adhesions.  A SBO may be caused when an adhesion pulls or kinks the small intestine and prevents the flow of content through the digestive tract. It can occur 20 years or more after the initial surgical procedure, if a previously benign adhesion allows the small bowel to spontaneously twist around itself and obstruct. SBO is an emergent, possibly fatal condition without immediate medical attention.  According to statistics provided by the [[National Hospital Discharge Survey]] approximately 2,000 people die every year in the USA from obstruction due to adhesions.<ref>See article at: www.adhesions.org/ardnewsrelease092303.pdf</ref> Depending on the severity of the obstruction, a partial obstruction may relieve itself with conservative medical intervention. However, many obstructive events require surgery to [[lyse]] the offending adhesion(s) or [[Segmental resection|resect]] the affected [[small intestine]].

===Pelvic adhesions===
Pelvic adhesions are a form of abdominal adhesions in the [[pelvis]], typically in women affecting reproductive organs and thus of concern in [[reproduction]] or as a cause of [[chronic pelvic pain]]. Other than surgery, [[endometriosis]], and [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] are typical causes. 

Surgery inside the [[uterine cavity]] (e.g., suction [[Dilation and curettage|D&C]], [[myomectomy]], [[endometrial ablation]]) can result in [[Asherman's Syndrome]] (also known as intrauterine adhesions), a cause of infertility.

A meta-analysis in 2012 came to the conclusion that there is only little evidence for the surgical principle that using less invasive techniques, introducing less foreign bodies or causing less ischemia reduces the extent and severity of adhesions in pelvic surgery.<ref name=Broek2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms032}}</ref>

===Pericardial adhesions===
Adhesions forming after cardiac surgery between the heart and the sternum place the heart at risk of catastrophic injury during re-entry for a subsequent procedure.

===Peridural adhesions===
Adhesions and scarring as epidural fibrosis may occur after spinal surgery that restricts the free movement of nerve roots, causing tethering and leading to pain.

===Peritendinous adhesions===
Adhesions and scarring occurring around tendons after hand surgery restrict the gliding of tendons in their sheaths and compromise digital mobility.

==Association with surgery==
A study in ''Digestive Surgery'' showed that more than 90% of patients develop adhesions following open [[abdominal surgery]] and 55%&ndash;100% of women develop adhesions following pelvic surgery.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liakakos | first1 = T | last2 = Thomakos | first2 = N | last3 = Fine | first3 = PM | last4 = Dervenis | first4 = C | last5 = Young | first5 = RL | title = Peritoneal adhesions: etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical significance.

In a very large study (29,790 participants) published in British medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', 35% of patients who underwent open abdominal or pelvic surgery were readmitted to the hospital an average of two times after their surgery due to adhesion-related or adhesion-suspected complications.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = H | last2 = Moran | first2 = BJ | last3 = Thompson | first3 = JN | last4 = Parker | first4 = MC | last5 = Wilson | first5 = MS | last6 = Menzies | first6 = D | last7 = McGuire | first7 = A | last8 = Lower | first8 = AM | last9 = Hawthorn | first9 = RJ | title = Adhesion-related hospital readmissions after abdominal and pelvic surgery: a retrospective cohort study | journal = Lancet | volume = 353 | issue = 9163 | pages = 1476–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10232313 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)09337-4 }}</ref> Over 22% of all readmissions occurred in the first year after the initial surgery.<ref name=Ellis/> Adhesion-related complexity at reoperation adds significant risk to subsequent surgical procedures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Der Krabben | first1 = AA | last2 = Dijkstra | first2 = FR | last3 = Nieuwenhuijzen | first3 = M | last4 = Reijnen | first4 = MM | last5 = Schaapveld | first5 = M | last6 = Van Goor | first6 = H | title = Morbidity and mortality of inadvertent enterotomy during adhesiotomy | journal = The British journal of surgery | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 467–71 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10759744 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2168.2000.01394.x }}</ref>

Before the availability of [[adhesion barrier]]s, adhesions were documented to be an almost unavoidable consequence of abdominal and pelvic surgery, and occurred in as much as 93% of all patients undergoing abdominal surgery.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adhesion prevention: a standard of care |date=February 2002 |work=Medical Association Communications |publisher=American Society of Reproductive Medicine |url=http://www.cmecorner.com/macmcm/asrm/asrm2002_02.htm}}</ref> However, note that the above cited study in ''Digestive Surgery'' was published within a year of this data, indicating that the occurrence of intestinal adhesions after abdominal surgery still remains at 90% or more despite the common usage of adhesion barrier products.

==Types==
Types of adhesions:
# '''Fibrinous adhesions'''. These are causes of early postoperative obstruction which settles down within 3–5 days. The majority of fibrinous adhesions will disappear in due course of time{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.
# '''Fibrous adhesions'''. If the infection is continuous or if foreign{{clarify|date=November 2010}} is present, the fibrinous material is converted into fibrous material{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.
