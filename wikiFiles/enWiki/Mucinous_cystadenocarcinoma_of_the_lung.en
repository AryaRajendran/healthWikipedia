'''Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the lung''' (MCACL) is a very rare [[malignant]] mucus-producing [[neoplasm]] arising from the uncontrolled growth of transformed epithelial cells originating in lung tissue.

==Synonyms==
Several other terms for this lesion have been used in the past medical literature, including mucinous multilocular cyst carcinoma, pseudomyxomatous pulmonary adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential, and others.<ref name='GaoUrbanski' />

==Classification==
According to the most recent revision (2004) of the World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification system for lung tumors ("WHO2004"), currently the most widely recognized typing scheme for pulmonary neoplasia, MCACL is considered a distinctive variant of [[adenocarcinoma]].<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

Informally, some experts have included these tumors as a distinct variant among a spectrum of mucus-producing adenocarcinomas, including — in order of increasing relative extent of cellular mucus production and extracellular mucus accumulation — solid adenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, and mucinous "colloid" adenocarcinoma.<ref name='TsutaIshii'>{{cite journal |author=Tsuta K, Ishii G, Nitadori J, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of the immunophenotypes of signet-ring cell carcinoma, solid adenocarcinoma with mucin production, and mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic mucin |journal=J.

==Incidence==
Accurate incidence statistics on MCACL are unavailable. It is a very rare tumor,<ref name='IshibashiMoriya'>{{cite journal |author=Ishibashi H, Moriya T, Matsuda Y, ''et al.'' |title=Pulmonary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma: report of a case and review of the literature |journal=Ann.

In the few cases described in the literature to date, the male-to-female ratio is approximately unity, and right lung lesions occurred twice as commonly as left lung lesions. Approximately 2/3 of cases have been associated with tobacco smoking.<ref name='GaoUrbanski' /> Cases have been reported in patients as young as 29.<ref name='SezerHoffmeier' />

==Diagnosis and Symptoms==

This particular variant of lung cancer is usually asymptomatic and is found after chest x-rays are taken for other reasons.<ref name='IwasakiKawahara'/> Hemoptysis is seen occasionally<ref name='IwasakiKawahara' /> and, in some cases, distal obstruction of bronchi by blood clots or mucus plugs produces cough and/or infection.<ref name='GaoUrbanski' /> Lesions often enlarge and progress slowly, over many years.<ref name='SezerHoffmeier' />

The 1999 World Health Organization classification system defined MCACL as a cystic adenocarcinoma with copious mucin production that, histologically, resembles (the more common) mucus-producing cystadenocarcinomas originating in the ovary, breast and pancreas.<ref name='who1999'>{{cite book |author=Travis, W.D.; Colby, T.V.; Corrin, B.; ''et al.'' |title=Histological Typing of Lung and Pleural Tumors |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1999 |isbn=3-540-65219-1 |series=International histological classification of tumours, no. 1 |edition=3rd}}</ref> The 2004 revision of the WHO classification noted that the tumors tend to be well circumscribed by a partial fibrous tissue capsule with central cystic change and copious mucin pooling.<ref name='who2004' /> The thin, fibrous wall circumscribing the tumor is highly characteristic of this lesion.<ref name='Tangthangtham'>{{cite journal |author=Tangthangtham A, Chonmaitri I, Tungsagunwattana S, Charupatanapongse U |title=Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the lung |journal=J Med Assoc Thai |volume=81 |issue=10 |pages=794–8 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9803072 }}</ref> It can sometimes occur within a pulmonary [[bronchocele]], and this tumor entity should be kept in mind after identification of a bronchocele with suspicious or non-prototypical imaging characteristics.<ref name='RazaAlexakis'>{{cite journal |author=Raza SA, Alexakis C, Creagh M, Lawrence DR, Wood M |title=Primary pulmonary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma presenting as a complex bronchocele: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=3 |issue= |pages=8581 |year=2009 |pmid=19830231 |pmc=2737758 |doi=10.4076/1752-1947-3-8581 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/3//8581}}</ref><ref name='ButnorSporn'>{{cite journal |author=Butnor KJ, Sporn TA, Dodd LG |title=Fine needle aspiration cytology of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the lung: report of a case with radiographic and histologic correlation |journal=Acta Cytol. |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=779–83 |year=2001 |pmid=11575661 }}</ref>

Microscopically, the neoplastic epithelial cells tend to grow along the alveolar walls, in a fashion similar to the mucinous variant of [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]], a more common form of adenocarcinoma.<ref name='who2004' />

Hemoptysis is seen occasionally.<ref name='IwasakiKawahara'>{{cite journal |author=Iwasaki T, Kawahara K, Nagano T, Nakagawa K |title=Pulmonary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma: an extremely rare tumor presenting as a cystic lesion of the lung |journal=Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=143–6 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17447515 |doi=10.1007/s11748-006-0089-z }}</ref> 

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning can be of assistance in diagnosing MCACL,<ref name='RazaAlexakis' /> as these lesions show intense uptake, typically in the wall of the tumor.<ref name='IwasakiKawahara' />

CA 19-9 has been reported to be elevated in MCACL.<ref name='IwasakiKawahara' />

Differential diagnosis of MCACL includes secondary metastatic cystadenocarcinomatous lesions, particularly from the pancreas or ovary, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and pulmonary mucinous [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]].<ref name='Tangthangtham' /<ref name='GaoUrbanski' /><ref name='IshibashiMoriya' /> The mouse monoclonal antibody 1D3, developed to detect a high molecular weight mucin found in a number of cystic malignancies of various organs, may be of use in differentiating primary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the lung from metastatic lung tumors due to mucinous cystic lesions of the uterus and pancreas, as well as those primary in the colon and stomach.<ref name='Gangopadhyay'>{{cite journal |author=Gangopadhyay A, Bhattacharya M, Chatterjee SK, Barlow JJ, Tsukada Y |title=Immunoperoxidase localization of a high-molecular-weight mucin recognized by monoclonal antibody 1D3 |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1744–52 |year=1985 |month=April |pmid=3884144 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3884144}}</ref>

==Histogenesis and Genetics==
MCACL has been noted in most cases to show areas of gradual transition wherein cells become more atypical and feature more pronounced characteristics of maignancy as one proceeds from the capsule, or outermost layers of the tumor, toward the center of the mass.<ref name="Tangthangtham"/> Some experts suggest that this tumor often develops after a slow progression from a relatively benign to a frankly malignant phenotype over a period of years to decades.<ref name='GaoUrbanski' />

The putative cell of origin of this tumor is unknown. Electron microscopic studies in 3 cases<ref name='KragelDevaney'>{{cite journal |author=Kragel PJ, Devaney KO, Meth BM, Linnoila I, Frierson HF, Travis WD |title=Mucinous cystadenoma of the lung.

Their failure to identify lamellar bodies and large dense granules seemed to rule out origination from either Clara cells or Type II pneumocytes.<ref name='GaoUrbanski' />

In a review of 66 cystic pulmonary mucinous lesions, Gao and colleagues reported that p53 expression and a Ki-67 index exceeding 20% is characteristic of MCACL.<ref name='GaoUrbanski' />

==Treatment==
For treatment purposes, MCACL has been traditionally considered a [[non-small cell lung carcinoma]] (NSCLC). Complete radical surgical resection is the treatment of choice.<ref name='GaetaBlandino'>{{cite journal |author=Gaeta M, Blandino A, Scribano E, Ascenti G, Minutoli F, Pandolfo I |title=Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the lung: CT-pathologic correlation in three cases |journal=J Comput Assist Tomogr |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=641–3 |year=1999 |pmid=10433300 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0363-8715&volume=23&issue=4&spage=641}}</ref>

There is virtually no data regarding new molecular targets or targeted therapy in the literature to date. Iwasaki and co-workers failed to find mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or the cellular Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene ''K-ras'' in one reported case.

==Prognosis and Survival==
MCACL has a much more favorable prognosis than most other forms of adenocarcinoma and most other NSCLC's.<ref name="RazaAlexakis"/><ref name="GaetaBlandino"/> Cases have been documented of continued growth of these lesions over a period of 10 years without symptoms or metastasis.<ref name='SezerHoffmeier'>{{cite journal |author=Sezer O, Hoffmeier A, Bettendorf O, ''et al.'' |title=Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma—an extremely rare tumor in a young patient |journal=Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=216–7 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16639689 |doi=10.1055/s-2005-872950 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2005-872950}}</ref> The overall mortality rate appears to be somewhere in the vicinity of 18% to 27%, depending on the criteria that are used to define this entity.<ref name='GaoUrbanski' />
