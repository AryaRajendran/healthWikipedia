'''Borderline personality disorder''' ('''BPD''') (called '''emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type''' in the [[ICD-10]]) is a [[personality disorder]] characterized by unusual variability and depth of [[Mood_(psychology)|moods]].<ref>http://documentaryhive.com/back-from-the-edge-borderline-personality-disorder/</ref> These moods may secondarily affect [[cognition]] and interpersonal relationships.<ref name="millon" group="n">{{Harvnb|Millon|1996|pp= 645–690}}</ref>

Other symptoms of BPD include impulsive behavior, intense and unstable [[interpersonal relationships]], unstable [[self-image]], feelings of abandonment and an unstable [[Identity (social science)|sense of self]].<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/borderlinepd.htm Borderline personality disorder] – ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref> People with BPD often engage in [[idealization and devaluation]] of themselves and of others, alternating between high positive regard and heavy disappointment or dislike.<ref>Linehan 1993a, p.146</ref> [[Self-harm]] and [[suicidal behavior]] are common and may require [[Inpatient_care|inpatient psychiatric care]].<ref name = BPD_fact_sheet/>

This disorder is recognized by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition, Text Revision'' (DSM-IV-TR) only in individuals over age 18. However, symptoms of BPD can also be found in children and adolescents.  Without treatment, symptoms may worsen, potentially leading to [[suicide]] attempts.<ref group="n">{{Harvnb|Linehan|Comtois|Murray|Brown|2006|pp=757–766}}</ref>

There is an ongoing debate about the [[#Terminology|terminology]] of this disorder, especially the word "borderline."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/name_change.htm|title=Borderline Personality Disorder: Proposal to include a supplementary name in the DSM-IV text revision|publisher=Borderline Personality Today|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref><ref name="mayo" /> The [[ICD-10]] manual refers to this disorder as ''Emotionally unstable personality disorder'' and has similar diagnostic criteria. There is related concern that the diagnosis of BPD [[Social stigma|stigmatizes]] people with BPD and supports discriminatory practices.<ref name="borderlinepersonalitytoday.com"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The DSM-IV-TR defines the main features of BPD as impulsive behavior and instability of emotions, interpersonal relationships, and self-image, and specifies 9 criteria to demonstrate the presence of these features.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/> However, many mental health professionals find it challenging to diagnose BPD using the criteria in the DSM-IV-TR, since this condition causes such a wide variety of behaviors.<ref name=Manning_13>Manning, p. 13</ref> To address this issue, [[Marsha Linehan]] has grouped the symptoms of BPD under five main areas of dysregulation: emotions, behavior, interpersonal relationships, sense of self, and cognition.<ref name=Manning_13/> 

===Emotions===
People with BPD feel emotions more easily, more deeply, and for longer than others do.<ref>Linehan 1993, p.43</ref> For instance, while an emotion typically fires for 12 seconds, it can last up to 20 percent longer in people with BPD.<ref name = Manning_36>Manning 2011, p.36</ref>  Moreover, emotions in people with BPD might repeatedly re-fire, or reinitiate, prolonging their emotional reactions even further.<ref name = Manning_36 /> Consequently, it can take a long time for people with BPD to return to a stable emotional baseline following an intense emotional experience.<ref name = Linehan_45>Linehan 1993, p.45</ref>  

In [[Marsha Linehan]]'s view, the sensitivity, intensity, and duration with which people with BPD feel emotions have both positive and negative effects.<ref name = Linehan_45 />  People with BPD are often exceptionally idealistic, joyful, and loving.<ref name = Linehan_44>Linehan 1993, p.44</ref>  However, they can feel overwhelmed by negative emotions, experiencing intense grief instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance, and panic instead of nervousness.<ref name = Linehan_44 /> People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, isolation, and perceived failure.<ref group="n">{{Harvnb|Stiglmayr|Grathwol|Linehan|Ihorst|2005|pp=372–9}}</ref> Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their intense negative emotions can lead to [[#Self-harm and suicidal behavior|self-injury or suicidal behavior]].<ref name = reasons_NSSI /> They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, shut them down entirely.<ref name=Linehan_45 />  This can be harmful to people with BPD, as negative emotions alert people to the presence of a problematic situation and move them to address it.<ref name=Linehan_45 />

While people with BPD also feel joy intensely, they are especially prone to [[dysphoria]], or feelings of mental and emotional distress.  Zanarini et al. recognize four categories of dysphoria that are typical of this condition: extreme emotions; destructiveness or self-destructiveness; feeling fragmented or lacking identity; and feelings of [[victimization]].<ref name = dysphoria>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, DeLuca CJ, Hennen J, Khera GS, Gunderson JG |title=The pain of being borderline: dysphoric states specific to borderline personality disorder |journal=Harvard Review of Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=201–7 |year=1998 |pmid=10370445 |doi= 10.3109/10673229809000330|url=}}</ref> Within these categories, a BPD diagnosis is strongly associated with a combination of three specific states: 1) feeling betrayed, 2) "feeling like hurting myself", and 3) feeling completely out of control.<ref name=dysphoria />  Since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria experienced by people with BPD, the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator of borderline personality disorder.<ref name=dysphoria />

In addition to intense emotions, people with BPD experience emotional lability, or changeability.  Although the term suggests rapid changes between depression and elation, the mood swings in people with this condition actually occur more frequently between anger and anxiety, and between [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koenigsberg HW, Harvey PD, Mitropoulou V, ''et al.'' |title=Characterizing affective instability in borderline personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=159 |issue=5 |pages=784–8 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11986132 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.159.5.784|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=175526}}</ref>

===Behavior===
Impulsive behaviors are common, including: [[substance abuse|substance]] or [[alcohol abuse]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[unprotected sex]] or sex with multiple partners, and [[reckless driving]].<ref>{{cite web|last=National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder|title=A BPD Brief|url=http://new.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/A_BPD_Brief_REV2011.pdf|accessdate=2013|page=4}}</ref> Treating "sex with multiple partners" as a symptom of mental illness is controversial and might lead to a greater percentage of women receiving a diagnosis of BPD, since having sex with multiple partners contradicts the traditional female [[gender role]] (see [[#Gender|Gender]] under [[#Controversies|Controversies]]).<ref name=Simmons /> Impulsive behaviors can also include quitting jobs or relationships, running away, shoplifting, and self-injury.<ref name=Manning_18/> 

People with BPD act impulsively because it gives them immediate relief from their emotional pain.<ref name=Manning_18/>  However, in the long-term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions.<ref name=Manning_18>Manning 2011, p.18</ref> They can also suffer long-term consequences of hospitalization, incarceration, homelessness, and poverty.<ref name=Manning_18/> A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behaviors to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behaviors to relieve the new pain.<ref name=Manning_18/> As time goes on, impulsive behaviors can become an automatic response to emotional pain.<ref name=Manning_18/>

===Self-harm and suicidal behavior===
[[Self-harm]]ing or suicidal behavior is one of the core diagnostic criteria in the DSM IV-TR.  Management of and recovery from this behavior can be complex and challenging.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hawton K, Townsend E, Arensman E, ''et al.'' |title=Psychosocial versus pharmacological treatments for deliberate self harm |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev. |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD001764 |year=2000 |pmid=10796818 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001764 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001764.html |editor1-last=Hawton |editor1-first=Keith KE}}</ref> The suicide rate among patients with BPD is 8 to 10 percent.<ref name=bpdtoday>[http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/facts.htm Borderline Personality Disorder Facts].

Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Horesh N, Sever J, Apter A |title=A comparison of life events between suicidal adolescents with major depression and borderline personality disorder |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=277–83 |year=2003 |month=Jul–August |pmid=12923705 |doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(03)00091-9 |url=}}</ref>

===Interpersonal relationships===
People with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them, feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness.<ref name="cogemo">{{cite journal |author=Arntz A |title=Introduction to special issue: cognition and emotion in borderline personality disorder |journal=Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=167–72 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16018875 |doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2005.06.001 |url= }}</ref> Their feelings about others often shift from positive to negative after a disappointment, a perceived threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem in the eyes of someone they value.  This phenomenon, sometimes called [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]] or black-and-white thinking, includes a shift from idealizing others (feeling great admiration and love) to devaluing them (feeling great anger or dislike).<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is BPD: Symptoms|url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/understading-bpd/|accessdate=January 2013}}</ref>  Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.<ref name="Robinson">{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = David J.| title = Disordered Personalities| publisher = Rapid Psychler Press| year = 2005| pages =255–310| isbn = 1-894328-09-4}}</ref> Self-image can also change rapidly from very positive to very negative.

While strongly desiring intimacy, people with BPD tend toward insecure, avoidant or ambivalent, or fearfully preoccupied [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|attachment patterns]] in relationships,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levy KN, Meehan KB, Weber M, Reynoso J, Clarkin JF |title=Attachment and borderline personality disorder: implications for psychotherapy |journal=Psychopathology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=64–74 |year=2005 |pmid=15802944 |doi=10.1159/000084813 |url=}}</ref> and they often view the world as generally dangerous and malevolent.<ref name="cogemo"/> BPD is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict in romantic relationships, decreased satisfaction of romantic partners, [[domestic violence|abuse]] and unwanted [[pregnancy]].  However, these factors appear to be linked to personality disorders in general.<ref name="Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C 2000 451–60">{{cite journal |author=Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C |title=Borderline personality disorder symptoms as predictors of 4-year romantic relationship dysfunction in young women: addressing issues of specificity |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=109 |issue=3 |pages=451–60 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=11016115 |doi= 10.1037/0021-843X.109.3.451|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/109/3/451}}</ref>

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] to obtain nurturance is considered to be a common feature of BPD by many who treat the disorder, as well as by the [[DSM-IV Codes|DSM-IV]].<ref>Zanarini, Mary C.

''BPD Today''. Retrieved 21 September 2007.</ref> However, some [[mental health]] professionals caution that an overemphasis on, and an overly broad definition of, "manipulation" can lead to misunderstanding and prejudicial treatment of people with BPD, particularly within the health care system.<ref name="manipulative">{{cite journal |author=Potter NN |title=What is manipulative behavior, anyway? |journal=J Personal Disord. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=139–56; discussion 181–5 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16643118 |doi=10.1521/pedi.2006.20.2.139 |url=}}</ref> See [[#Manipulative behavior|Manipulative behavior]] and [[#Stigma|Stigma]] under [[#Controversies|Controversies]].

===Cognitions===
The intense emotions of people with BPD can make it difficult for them to control the focus of their attention.  In other words, it can be difficult for them to concentrate.<ref name=Manning_23>Manning, p.23</ref> In addition, people with BPD might [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]], which can be thought of as an intense form of "zoning out."<ref name=Manning_24>Manning, p.24</ref>  Dissociation often takes place in response to a painful event, or to a "trigger" that causes someone to recall a painful event, and consists of directing partial or full attention away from that event.<ref name=Manning_24/> Although blocking out painful emotions provides relief from them, it inhibits the natural experience of emotions, and decreases the ability of people with BPD to function in their daily lives.<ref name=Manning_24/> Sometimes it is possible to tell when someone with BPD is dissociating, because their facial or vocal expressions might become flat or expressionless, or they may appear to be very distracted; at other times, dissociation might be barely noticeable.<ref name=Manning_24/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is based on a clinical [[psychiatric assessment|assessment]] by a qualified  mental health professional. The assessment consists of the client's self-reported experiences as well as the clinician's observations. With permission from the client, the assessment may include interviews with friends or family members.

===Diagnostic and Statistical Manual===
<!-- Please do not add diagnosis criteria as this constitutes a copyright violation. APA has forbidden us.-->
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] fourth edition (DSM-IV-TR) has criteria for borderline personality disorder in Axis II [[Personality_disorder#Cluster_B_.28dramatic.2C_emotional_or_erratic_disorders.29|Cluster B]]<ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/> that can be found on [http://behavenet.com/borderline-personality-disorder behavenet]. Five or more criteria must be present for diagnosis.<ref name = "DSM-IV-TR" />

===International Classification of Disease===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]] defines a conceptually similar disorder to borderline personality disorder, called ''({{ICD10|F|60|3|f|60}}) Emotionally unstable personality disorder''. Its two subtypes are described below.<ref name="borderline">[http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-pe05.html Emotionally unstable personality disorder – [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] 10th Revision ([[ICD-10]]) – [[World Health Organization]]]</ref>

;F60.30 Impulsive type
At least three of the following must be present, one of which must be (2):
# marked tendency to act unexpectedly and without consideration of the consequences;
# marked tendency to engage in quarrelsome behavior and to have conflicts with others, especially when impulsive acts are thwarted or criticized;
# liability to outbursts of anger or violence, with inability to control the resulting behavioral explosions;
# difficulty in maintaining any course of action that offers no immediate reward;
# unstable and capricious (impulsive, whimsical) mood.

;F60.31 Borderline type
At least three of the symptoms mentioned in ''F60.30 Impulsive type'' must be present [see above], with at least two of the following in addition:
# disturbances in and uncertainty about self-image, aims, and internal preferences;
# liability to become involved in intense and unstable relationships, often leading to emotional crisis;
# excessive efforts to avoid abandonment;
# recurrent threats or acts of self-harm;
# chronic feelings of emptiness.
# demonstrates impulsive behavior, e.g., speeding, substance abuse<ref>Neil R.Carlson, C.Donald Heth. "Psychology: The Science of Behavior". Pearson Canada Inc,2010, p.570.</ref>
The ICD-10 also describes some [[Personality disorder#Diagnosis|general criteria]] that define what is considered a personality disorder.

===Millon's subtypes===
[[Theodore Millon]] has proposed four subtypes of BPD. He suggests that an individual diagnosed with BPD may exhibit none, one, or more of the following:<ref name="Millon">Millon, Theodore (2004).

=== Family members ===
Family members of people with BPD often feel confused and frustrated by unclear diagnoses, ineffective treatments, and inaccurate information.  Theories that [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] plays a causal role in the development of BPD<ref name="BPD & PTSD">{{cite journal |author=Gunderson JG, Sabo AN |title=The phenomenological and conceptual interface between borderline personality disorder and PTSD |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=150 |pages=19–27 |year=1993 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=169168 |pmid=8417576 |issue=1}}</ref> (see [[#Gender|Gender]] and [[#Terminology|Terminology]]), as well as findings that a majority of people with BPD have experienced [[childhood trauma]] (see [[#Childhood abuse|Childhood abuse]]), can stigmatize family members by implying that they bear primary responsibility for this disorder, despite evidence of diverse causes (see [[#Causes|Causes]]).  

A study in 2003 found that family members' experience of burden, emotional distress, and hostility toward people with BPD were actually worse when they had greater knowledge about BPD.<ref name = family_experience>{{cite journal |author=Hoffman PD, Buteau E, Hooley JM, Fruzzetti AE, Bruce ML |title=Family members' knowledge about borderline personality disorder: correspondence with their levels of depression, burden, distress, and expressed emotion |journal=Family Process |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=469–78 |year=2003 |pmid=14979218 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.2003.00469.x }}</ref> These findings indicate a need to investigate the quality and accuracy of the information received by family members.<ref name=family_experience />

However, these links may apply to personality disorders in general.<ref name="Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C 2000 451–60"/>

===Adolescence===
Onset of symptoms typically occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, although symptoms suggestive of this disorder can sometimes be observed in children.<ref>Linehan 1993, p.49</ref> Clinicians are discouraged from diagnosing anyone with BPD before the age of 18, due to adolescence and a still-developing personality.  However, BPD can sometimes be diagnosed before age 18, in which case the features must have been present and consistent for at least 1 year.<ref name = "DSM-IV-TR"/>

A BPD diagnosis in adolescence might predict that the disorder will continue into adulthood.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/><ref name="Netherton">Netherton, S.D., Holmes, D., Walker, C.E. 1999. Child and Adolescent Psychological Disorders: Comprehensive Textbook.

The many, shifting Axis I disorders in people with BPD can sometimes cause clinicians to miss the presence of the underlying personality disorder.  However, since a complex pattern of Axis I diagnoses has been found to strongly predict the presence of BPD, clinicians can use the feature of a complex pattern of comorbidity as a clue that BPD might be present.<ref name=comorbidity />

=====Mood disorders=====
Borderline personality disorder and [[mood disorders]], such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorders, are often comorbid.<ref name="Robinson"/> Some characteristics of BPD are similar to those of mood disorders, which can complicate the diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bolton S, Gunderson JG |title=Distinguishing borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder: differential diagnosis and implications |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=9 |pages=1202–7 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=8780426 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8780426}}</ref><ref name=APAguide>(2001).

Retrieved 21 September 2007.</ref><ref>"[http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/diffdx.htm Differential Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder]". ''BPD Today''. Retrieved 21 September 2007.</ref> It is especially common for people to be misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when they have borderline personality disorder, or vice versa.<ref name=Chapman_87>Chapman, p.87</ref> For someone with bipolar disorder, behavior suggestive of BPD might appear while the client is experiencing an episode of major depression or [[mania]], only to disappear once the client's mood has stabilized.<ref name = BPD_vs_BD />  For this reason, it is ideal to wait until the client's mood has stabilized before attempting to make a diagnosis.<ref name = BPD_vs_BD />  

At face value, the affective lability of BPD and the rapid mood cycling of bipolar disorders can seem very similar.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mackinnon DF, Pies R |title=Affective instability as rapid cycling: theoretical and clinical implications for borderline personality and bipolar spectrum disorders |journal=Bipolar Disord. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16411976 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2006.00283.x |url=}}</ref><ref>Goldberg, Ivan MD (February 2006).

Retrieved 21 September 2007.</ref>  It can be difficult even for experienced clinicians, if they are unfamiliar with BPD, to differentiate between the mood swings of these two conditions.<ref name=Chapman_88>Chapman, p.88</ref> However, there are some clear differences.<ref name=Chapman_87 /> 

First, the mood swings of BPD and bipolar disorder have different durations.  In some people with bipolar disorder, episodes of depression or mania last for at least two weeks at a time, which is much longer than moods last in people with BPD.<ref name=Chapman_87 />  Even among those who experience bipolar disorder with more rapid mood shifts, their moods usually last for days, while the moods of people with BPD can change in minutes or hours.<ref name=Chapman_88/> So while euphoria and impulsivity in someone with BPD might resemble a [[manic episode]], the experience would be too brief for a manic episode.<ref name = BPD_vs_BD /><ref name=Chapman_88/>

Second, the moods of bipolar disorder do not respond to changes in the environment, while the moods of BPD do respond to changes in the environment.<ref name = BPD_vs_BD>{{cite book |author=Jamison, Kay R.; Goodwin, Frederick Joseph |title=Manic-depressive illness |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1990 |page=108 |isbn=0-19-503934-3 }}</ref> That is, a positive event could not lift the depressed mood caused by bipolar disorder, but a positive event could potentially lift the depressed mood of someone with BPD.  Similarly, a negative event could not dampen the [[euphoria]] caused by bipolar disorder, but a negative event could dampen the euphoria of someone with borderline personality disorder.<ref name = BPD_vs_BD />  

Third, people with BPD usually experience euphoria without the racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep that are typical of [[hypomania]].<ref name = BPD_vs_BD />  Bipolar disorders generally involve high levels of sleep and appetite disturbance, but severe sleep disturbance is rarely seen among the symptoms of BPD.<ref name = BPD_vs_BD />

Due to the similarity of the two conditions, BPD was once considered to be a mild form of [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Akiskal HS, Yerevanian BI, Davis GC, King D, Lemmi H |title=The nosologic status of borderline personality: clinical and polysomnographic study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=192–8 |year=1985 |month=February |pmid=3970243 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3970243}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gunderson JG, Elliott GR |title=The interface between borderline personality disorder and affective disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=277–88 |year=1985 |month=March |pmid=2857532 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2857532}}</ref> or to exist on the [[bipolar spectrum]].  However, this would require that the underlying mechanism causing these symptoms be the same for both conditions.  Differences in phenomenology, family history, longitudinal course, and responses to treatment indicate that this is not the case.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paris|first=J.|title=Borderline or bipolar?

=====Premenstrual dysphoric disorder=====
[[Premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD) occurs in 3-8 percent of women. Symptoms begin 5–11 days before a woman's period and cease a few days after it begins.<ref>{{cite web|title=Premenstrual dysphoric disorder|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004461/|work=A.D.A.M.

In addition, the symptoms of PMDD do not include impulsivity.

====Comorbid Axis II disorders====
Comorbid personality disorders are highly common among people diagnosed with BPD. A 2008 study found that at some point in their lives, 73.9 percent of people with BPD meet criteria for a second Axis II disorder.<ref name=Axis_II_comorbidity>{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Bridget F.|coauthors=S.

These have an overall prevalence of 49.2 percent in people with BPD, with narcissistic being the most common, at 38.9 percent; antisocial the second most common, at 13.7 percent; and histrionic the least common, at 10.3 percent.<ref name=Axis_II_comorbidity />  The least common are Cluster C disorders, which include [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], and [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], and have a prevalence of 29.9 percent in people with BPD.<ref name=Axis_II_comorbidity />  The percentages for specific comorbid Axis II disorders can be found in the table below.

==Causes==
As with other mental disorders, the causes of BPD are complex and not fully understood.<ref name="mayo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION=3|title=Borderline personality disorder|publisher=MayoClinic.com|accessdate=15 May 2008}}</ref> Evidence suggests that BPD and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[PTSD]]) are closely related.<ref name="BPD & PTSD"/> However, research also suggests diverse possible causes of BPD, including a history of childhood trauma,<ref name=kluft/> brain abnormalities, genetic predisposition, neurobiological factors, and environmental factors.<ref name="mayo" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR |title=Pathways to the development of borderline personality disorder |journal=Journal of personality disorders |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=93–104 |year=1997 |pmid=9113824 |doi=10.1521/pedi.1997.11.1.93 }}</ref>

===Genetics===
The [[heritability]] of BPD is estimated to be .65.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Torgersen S, Lygren S, Oien PA, ''et al.'' |title=A twin study of personality disorders |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=416–25 |year=2000 |pmid=11086146 |doi=10.1053/comp.2000.16560 |url=}}</ref>  That is, 65 percent of the [[statistical variability|variability]] in symptoms among different individuals with BPD can be explained by [[human genetic variation|genetic differences]]; note that this is different from saying that 65 percent of BPD is caused by genes.  [[Twin studies]] may overestimate the effect of [[genes]] on variability in personality disorders due to the complicating factor of a shared family environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Torgersen S |title=Genetics of patients with borderline personality disorder |journal=Psychiatr Clin North Am |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10729927 |doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70139-8 }}</ref> 

Twin, sibling and other family studies indicate partial [[heritability]] for impulsive aggression, but studies of [[serotonin]]-related genes have suggested only modest contributions to behavior.<ref name=neurotrauma>{{cite journal |author=Goodman M, New A, Siever L |title=Trauma, genes, and the neurobiology of personality disorders |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1032 |issue= |pages=104–16 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15677398 |doi=10.1196/annals.1314.008 |url=}}</ref>

===Brain abnormalities===

====Hippocampus====
The [[hippocampus]] is smaller in people with BPD. This trait is shared by individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder. However, only in BPD are both the hippocampus and the [[amygdala]] smaller.<ref name = "Chapman">{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=Alexander L.|last2=Grantz|first2=Kim L.|title=The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD|publisher=New Harbinger Publications, Inc|year=2007|page=47}}</ref>

====Amygdala====
The [[amygdala]] is smaller and more active in people with BPD.<ref name = "Chapman" /> Decreased amygdala volume has also been found in people with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Szeszko|first=Philip R.|coauthors=Delbert Robinson, MD; Jose Ma.

====Prefrontal cortex====
The [[prefrontal cortex]] is less active in people with BPD, especially when recalling memories of abandonment.<ref name = "Schmahl">{{cite journal|last=Schmahl|first=C.G.|coauthors=B.M. Elzinga, E. Vermetten, C. Sanislow, T.H. McGlashan, and J.D. Bremner|title=Neural correlates of memories of abandonment in women with and without borderline personality disorder|journal=Biological Psychiatry|year=2003|volume=54|issue=2|pages=142–151}}</ref> This relative inactivity occurs in the right [[anterior cingulate]] (areas [[Brodmann area 24|24]] and [[Brodmann area 32|32]]).<ref name = "Schmahl" /> Given its role in regulating emotional arousal, the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with BPD experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=Alexander L.|last2=Grantz|first2=Kim L.|title=The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD|publisher=New Harbinger Publications, Inc|year=2007|page=48}}</ref>

====Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis====
The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) regulates [[cortisol]] production, which is released in response to stress.  Cortisol production is elevated in people with BPD, indicating a hyperactive HPA axis in these individuals.<ref name=Grossman>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Robert|coauthors=Rachel Yehuda, Larry Siever|title=The Dexamethasone Suppression Test and Glucocorticoid Receptors in Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=Psychobiology of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|year=1997|month=June|volume=821|pages=459–464|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48305.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48305.x/abstract;jsessionid=BAF27BDD2979D001B160B2F564F62826.d01t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false}}</ref>   This causes them to experience a greater biological stress response, which might explain their greater vulnerability to [[irritability]].<ref name=Chapman2>{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=Alexander L.|last2=Grantz|first2=Kim L.|title=The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD|publisher=New Harbinger Publications, Inc|year=2007|page=49}}</ref>  Since traumatic events can increase cortisol production and HPA axis activity, the unusual activity in the HPA axis of people with BPD may be related to the traumatic childhood and maturational events that correlate with this condition.<ref name=Chapman2 />  Conversely, by heightening their sensitivity to stressful events, increased cortisol production may predispose those with BPD to experience stressful childhood and maturational events as traumatic.  

Increased cortisol production is also associated with suicidal behavior.<ref>{{cite journal|last=van Heeringen|first=Kees|coauthors=Kurt Audenaert, Lieve Van de Wiele, Alain Verstraete|title=Cortisol in violent suicidal behavior: association with personality and monoaminergic activity|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|year=2000|month=November|volume=60|issue=3|pages=181–189|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032799001809|doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00180-9}}</ref>

===Neurobiological factors===

====Estrogen====
Individual differences in women's [[estrogen]] cycles may be related to the expression of BPD symptoms in female patients.<ref name=DeSoto_book>{{cite book|last1=DeSoto|first1=M. Catherine|last2=Czerbska|first2=Martina T.|title=Psychoneuroendocrinology Research Trends|year=2007|publisher=Nova Science Publishers, Inc.|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=T9MlHPqTyy8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA149&dq=estrogen+bpd&ots=sHTGrfrCIn&sig=r4uOJ9B2S1xRAA3ahsQxZqmVTd0#v=onepage&q=150&f=false}}</ref> A 2003 study found that women's BPD symptoms were predicted by changes in estrogen levels throughout their [[menstrual cycles]], an effect that remained significant when the results were controlled for a general increase in [[negative affect]].<ref name=DeSoto_article>{{cite journal|last=DeSoto|first=M.

When women who were already experiencing high levels of BPD symptoms began using estrogen-based oral contraceptives, their BPD symptoms worsened significantly.<ref name=DeSoto_article />

===Adverse childhood experiences===
There is a strong correlation between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD.<ref name=kluft>{{Cite book|title=Incest-Related Syndromes of Adult Psychopathology |first=Richard P.|last=Kluft |year=1990 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub, Inc.|pages=83, 89 |isbn=0-88048-160-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Gunderson JG, Marino MF, Schwartz EO, Frankenburg FR |title=Childhood experiences of borderline patients |journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=18–25 |year=1989 |month=Jan–February |pmid=2924564 |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(89)90114-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown GR, Anderson B |title=Psychiatric morbidity in adult inpatients with childhood histories of sexual and physical abuse |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=55–61 |year=1991 |month=January |pmid=1984707 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1984707}}</ref><ref name=Herman91>{{cite book |author=Herman, Judith Lewis; Judith Herman MD |title=Trauma and recovery |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-465-08730-2 }}</ref><ref name="AxisOne/AxisTwo"/> Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zanarini M.C., Frankenburg F.R. | year = 1997 | title = Pathways to the development of borderline personality disorder | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Disorders | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 93–104 | pmid = 9113824 | doi = 10.1521/pedi.1997.11.1.93 }}</ref> Patients with BPD have been found to be significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood.<ref name=failchild>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Reich DB, ''et al.'' |title=Biparental failure in the childhood experiences of borderline patients |journal=J Personal Disord |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=264–73 |year=2000 |pmid=11019749 |doi=10.1521/pedi.2000.14.3.264 }}</ref>

Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally, and to have treated the child inconsistently.<ref name="failchild"/>

Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were consequently at significantly higher risk of reporting sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.<ref name="failchild"/> It has been suggested that children who experience chronic early maltreatment and [[Attachment (psychology)|attachment]] difficulties may go on to develop borderline personality disorder.<ref name="Dozier-1999">Dozier, M.; K. C. Stovall, et al. (1999). "Attachment and psychopathology in adulthood" in Cassidy, J.; P. Shaver (Eds.), ''Handbook of attachment'' pp. 497–519. New York: [[Guilford Press]].</ref>

===Other developmental factors===
The intensity and reactivity of a person's [[negative affectivity]], or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms more strongly than does childhood sexual abuse.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> This finding, differences in brain structure (see [[#Brain abnormalities|Brain abnormalities]]), and the fact that some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history,<ref>Chapman 2007, p. 52</ref> suggest that BPD is distinct from the [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that frequently accompanies it.  Thus researchers examine developmental causes in addition to childhood trauma.

Writing in the psychoanalytic tradition, [[Otto Kernberg]] argues that a child's failure to achieve the developmental task of [[Otto_F._Kernberg#First_developmental_task:_psychic_clarification_of_self_and_other|psychic clarification of self and other]] and failure to overcome [[splitting]] might increase the risk of developing a borderline personality.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kernberg, Otto F. |title=Borderline conditions and pathological narcissism |publisher=J. Aronson |location=Northvale, N.J. |pages= |isbn=0-87668-762-1 }}</ref>

A child's ability to tolerate delayed gratification at age 4 does not predict later development of BPD.<ref name=Ayduk>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2007.04.002 | author = Ayduk O., Zayas V., Downey G., Cole A.

===Mediating and moderating factors===

====Executive function====
While high [[Rejection_sensitivity#Rejection_sensitivity|rejection sensitivity]] is associated with stronger symptoms of borderline personality disorder, [[executive function]] appears to [[Mediation (statistics)|mediate]] the relationship between rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms.<ref name=Executive_function>{{cite journal|last=Ayduk|first=Özlem|coauthors=Vivian Zayas, Geraldine Downey, Amy Blum Cole, Yuichi Shoda, Walter Mischel|title=Rejection sensitivity and executive control: Joint predictors of borderline personality features|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2008|month=February|volume=42|issue=1|pages=151–168|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607000426|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2007.04.002|pmid=18496604|pmc=2390893}}</ref>  That is, a group of [[cognitive processes]] that include planning, [[working memory]], attention, and problem-solving might be the mechanism through which rejection sensitivity impacts BPD symptoms.  A 2008 study found that the relationship between a person's rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms was stronger when executive function was lower, and that the relationship was weaker when executive function was higher.<ref name=Executive_function/>  This suggests that high executive function might help protect people with high rejection sensitivity against symptoms of BPD.<ref name=Executive_function/>  

A 2012 study found that problems in working memory might contribute to greater impulsivity in people with BPD.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lazzaretti|first=Matteo|coauthors=Niccolò Morandotti, Michela Sala, Miriam Isola, Sophia Frangou, Giulia De Vidovich, Elisa Marraffini, Francesca Gambini, Francesco Barale, Federico Zappoli, Edgardo Caverzasi, Paolo Brambilla|title=Impaired working memory and normal sustained attention in borderline personality disorder|journal=Acta Neuropsychiatrica|year=2012|month=March|volume=24|issue=6|pages=349–355|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5215.2011.00630.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1601-5215.2011.00630.x/abstract|accessdate=2013}}</ref>

====Family environment====
Family environment mediates the effect of child sexual abuse on the development of BPD.  An unstable family environment predicts the development of the disorder, while a stable family environment may buffer against it.<ref name=Bradley>{{cite journal | author = Bradley R., Jenei J., Westen D. | year = 2005 | title = Etiology of borderline personality disorder: Disentangling the contributions of intercorrelated antecedents | url = | journal = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 193 | issue = 1| pages = 24–31 | pmid = 15674131 }}</ref>

====Self-complexity====
[[Self-complexity]], or considering one's self to have many different characteristics, appears to moderate the relationship between Actual-Ideal [[Self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] and the development of BPD symptoms.  That is, for individuals who believe that their actual characteristics do not match the characteristics that they hope to acquire, high self-complexity reduces the impact of their conflicted self-image on BPD symptoms.   However, self-complexity does not moderate the relationship between Actual-Ought [[Self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] and the development of BPD symptoms.  That is, for individuals who believe that their actual characteristics do not match the characteristics that they should already have, high self-complexity does not reduce the impact of their conflicted self-image on BPD symptoms.  The protective role of self-complexity in Actual-Ideal self-discrepancy, but not in Actual-Ought self-discrepancy, suggests that the impact of conflicted or unstable self-image in BPD depends on whether the individual views self in terms of characteristics that she hopes to acquire, or in terms of characteristics that she should already have.<ref name=Parker>Parker, A. G., Boldero, J. M., & Bell, R. C. (2006). Borderline personality disorder features: The role of self-discrepancies & self-complexity. Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice, 79, 309–321.</ref>

====Thought suppression====
A 2005 study found that [[thought suppression]], or conscious attempts to avoid thinking certain thoughts, mediates the relationship between [[negative affectivity|emotional vulnerability]] and BPD symptoms.<ref name = Rosenthal>Rosenthal, M. Z., Cheavens, J. S., Lejuez, C. W., Lynch, T. R. (2005). Thought suppression mediates the relationship between negative affect and borderline personality disorder symptoms. Behaviour and Research Therapy, 43(9), 1173–1185.</ref> A later study found that the relationship between emotional vulnerability and BPD symptoms is not necessarily mediated by thought suppression.  However, this study did find that thought suppression mediates the relationship between an invalidating environment and BPD symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sauer|first=SE|coauthors=RA Baer|title=Relationships between thought suppression and symptoms of borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|year=2009|month=February|volume=23|issue=1|pages=48–61|doi=10.1521/pedi.2009.23.1.48|pmid=19267661}}</ref>

==Management==
{{Main|Management of borderline personality disorder}}

===Psychotherapy===
Long-term psychotherapy is currently the treatment of choice for BPD.<ref name=BPD_therapies>{{cite journal|last=Zanarini|first=MC|title=Psychotherapy of borderline personality disorder|journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavia|year=2009|month=November|volume=120|issue=5|pages=373–377|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01448.x|pmid=19807718|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19807718|accessdate=2013}}</ref>  There are four such treatments available: [[Mentalization-based treatment|mentalization-based treatment (MBT)]], [[Transference focused psychotherapy|transference-focused psychotherapy]], [[dialectical behaviour therapy|dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)]], and [[Schema Therapy|schema-focused therapy]].

From a psychodynamic perspective, a special problem of psychotherapy with people with BPD is intense [[Psychological projection|projection]].  It requires the psychotherapist to be flexible in considering negative attributions by the patient rather than quickly interpreting the projection.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Blechner M | year = 1994 | title = Projective identification, countertransference, and the "maybe-me." | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=cps.030.0619a | journal = The Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research | volume = | issue = 8 | pages = 155–161 }}</ref>

===Medications===
A 2010 review by the [[Cochrane collaboration]] found that no medications show promise for "the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment." However, the authors found that some medications may impact isolated symptoms associated with BPD or the symptoms of comorbid conditions.<ref name=Stoffers>{{cite journal |author=Stoffers J, Völlm BA, Rücker G, Timmer A, Huband N, Lieb K |title=Pharmacological interventions for borderline personality disorder |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=6 |pages=CD005653 |year=2010 |pmid=20556762 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2/full |editor1-last=Lieb |editor1-first=Klaus}}</ref>

Of the [[typical antipsychotic]]s studied in relation to BPD, [[haloperidol]] may reduce anger, and [[flupenthixol]] may reduce the likelihood of suicidal behavior. Among the [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, [[aripiprazole]] may reduce interpersonal problems, impulsivity, anger, psychotic paranoid symptoms, depression, anxiety, and general psychiatric pathology. [[Olanzapine]] may decrease affective instability, anger, psychotic paranoid symptoms, and anxiety, but a [[placebo]] had a greater ameliorative impact on suicidal ideation than olanzapine did. The effect of [[Ziprasidone]] was not significant.<ref name=Stoffers/>

Of the [[mood stabilizers]] studied, [[valproate semisodium]] may ameliorate depression, interpersonal problems, and anger. [[Lamotrigine]] may reduce impulsivity and anger; [[topiramate]] may ameliorate interpersonal problems, impulsivity, anxiety, anger and general psychiatric pathology. The effect of [[carbamazepine]] was not significant effect. Of the [[antidepressant]]s, [[amitriptyline]] may reduce depression, but [[mianserin]], [[fluoxetine]], [[fluvoxamine]] and [[phenelzine]] sulfate showed no effect. [[Omega-3 fatty acid]] may ameliorate suicidality and improve depression. As of 2010, trials with these medications had not been replicated, and the effect of long-term use had not been assessed.<ref name=Stoffers/>

Because of weak evidence and the potential for serious side effects from some of these medications, the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 clinical guideline for the treatment and management of BPD recommends: "Drug treatment should not be used specifically for borderline personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behavior associated with the disorder."  However, "drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions." They suggest a "review of the treatment of people with borderline personality disorder who do not have a diagnosed comorbid mental or physical illness and who are currently being prescribed drugs, with the aim of reducing and stopping unnecessary drug treatment."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12125/42900/42900.pdf  | title = The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2009 clinical guideline for the treatment and management of BPD |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= | accessdate=6 September 2011}}</ref>

===Services===
Individuals with BPD sometimes use mental health services extensively. They accounted for about 20 percent of psychiatric hospitalizations in one survey.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Khera GS, Bleichmar J |title=Treatment histories of borderline inpatients |journal=Compr Psychiatry. |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=144–50 |year=2001 |pmid=11244151 |doi=10.1053/comp.2001.19749 |url=}}</ref> The majority of patients with BPD continue to use outpatient treatment in a sustained manner for several years, but the number using the more restrictive and costly forms of treatment, such as inpatient admission, declines with time.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J, Silk KR |title=Mental health service utilization by borderline personality disorder patients and Axis II comparison subjects followed prospectively for 6 years |journal=J Clin Psychiatry. |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=28–36 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14744165 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v65n0105|url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10000660}}</ref> Experience of services varies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fallon P |title=Travelling through the system: the lived experience of people with borderline personality disorder in contact with psychiatric services |journal=J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=393–401 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12887630 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2850.2003.00617.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1351-0126&date=2003&volume=10&issue=4&spage=393}}</ref> Assessing suicide risk can be a challenge for clinicians, and patients themselves tend to underestimate the lethality of self-injurious behaviors.

==Prognosis==
With treatment, the majority of people with BPD can find relief from distressing symptoms and achieve remission, defined as a consistent relief from symptoms for at least two years.<ref name=longitudinal_remission>{{cite journal|last=Zanarini|first=Mary C.|coauthors=Frances R. Frankenburg; John Hennen; Kenneth R. Silk|title=The Longitudinal Course of Borderline Psychopathology: 6-Year Prospective Follow-Up of the Phenomenology of Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=2003|month=February|volume=160|pages=274–283|accessdate=2013}}</ref><ref name=PToverview/>  A [[longitudinal study]] tracking the symptoms of people with BPD found that 34.5% achieved remission within two years from the beginning of the study. Within four years, 49.4% had achieved remission, and within six years, 68.6% had achieved remission.  By the end of the study, 73.5% of participants were found to be in remission.<ref name=longitudinal_remission /> Moreover, of those who achieved recovery from symptoms, only 5.9% experienced recurrences.  A later study found that ten years from baseline (during a hospitalization), 86% of patients had sustained and stable recovery from symptoms.<ref name=Treatment>{{cite news|last1=Herold|last2=Valora|first1=Eve|first2=Jaime|title=Long-Term Study of Borderline Personality Disorder Shows Importance of Measuring Real-World Outcomes|url=http://www.mclean.harvard.edu/news/press/current.php?kw=long-term-study-borderline-personality-disorder-shows-importance-measuring&id=153|accessdate=2013|newspaper=McLean Hospital: Press Release|date=15 April 2010}}</ref> 

Thus contrary to popular belief, recovery from BPD is not only possible but common, even for those with the most severe symptoms.<ref name=longitudinal_remission /> However, it is important to note that these high rates of relief from distressing symptoms have only been observed among those who receive treatment of some kind.<ref name=longitudinal_remission />  

Patient personality can play an important role during the therapeutic process, leading to better clinical outcomes. Recent research has shown that BPD patients with higher levels of trait agreeableness undergoing Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) exhibited better clinical outcomes than other patients either low in Agreeableness or not being treated with DBT. This association was mediated through the strength of a working alliance between patient and therapist; that is, more Agreeable patients developed stronger working alliances with their therapists which in turn led to better clinical outcomes.<ref>Hirsh, J. B., Quilty, L. C., Bagby, R. M., & McMain, S. F. (2012). The relationship between agreeableness and the development of the working alliance in patients with borderline personality disorder. Journal of Personality Disorders, 26, 616-627.</ref>

In addition to recovering from distressing symptoms, people with BPD also achieve high levels of [[psychosocial]] functioning. A longitudinal study tracking the social and work abilities of participants with BPD found that six years after diagnosis, 56% of participants had good function in work and social environments, compared to 26% of participants when they were first diagnosed. Vocational achievement was generally more limited, even compared to those with other personality disorders.  However, those whose symptoms had remitted were significantly more likely to have good relationships with a romantic partner and at least one parent, good performance at work and school, a sustained work and school history, and good psychosocial functioning overall.<ref>Zanarini, M.C.; F.R. Frankenburg, J. Hennen, et al. (February 2005).

==History==
The coexistence of intense, divergent moods within an individual was recognized by [[Homer]], [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia|Aretaeus]], the last describing the vacillating presence of impulsive anger, melancholia and mania within a single person. The concept was revived by Swiss physician Théophile Bonet in 1684 who, using the term ''folie maniaco-mélancolique'',<ref group="n">{{Harvnb|Millon|Grossman|Meagher|2004|p=172}}</ref> described the phenomenon of unstable moods that followed an unpredictable course. Other writers noted the same pattern, including the American psychiatrist C. Hughes in 1884 and J.C. Rosse in 1890, who called the disorder "borderline insanity".<ref>{{cite journal|author = C. Hughes|year = 1884|title = Borderline psychiatric records – prodronal symptoms of physical impairments|journal= Alienists & Neurology|volume = 5|pates = 85–90}}</ref> In 1921, [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] identified an "excitable personality" that closely parallels the borderline features outlined in the current concept of BPD.<ref name="millon" group="n"/>

The first significant psychoanalytic work to use the term "borderline" was written by Adolf Stern in 1938.<ref name=stern>{{Cite journal|first= Adolf |last= Stern |year= 1938 |title= Psychoanalytic investigation of and therapy in the borderline group of neuroses |journal= Psychoanalytic Quarterly |volume= 7 |pages= 467–489 }}</ref>  It described a group of patients suffering from what he thought to be a mild form of [[schizophrenia]], on the borderline between [[neurosis]] and [[psychosis]]. 

The 1960s and 1970s saw a shift from thinking of the condition as borderline schizophrenia to thinking of it as a borderline affective disorder (mood disorder), on the fringes of bipolar disorder, [[cyclothymia]] and [[dysthymia]]. In the [[DSM-II]], stressing the intensity and variability of moods, it was called  [[cyclothymic personality]] (affective personality).<ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/> While the term "borderline" was evolving to refer to a distinct category of disorder, psychoanalysts such as [[Otto Kernberg]] were using it to refer to a broad [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]] of issues, describing an intermediate level of personality organization<ref name="millon" group="n"/> between neurosis and psychosis.<ref name="autogenerated1">Aronson, T (1985) Historical perspectives on the borderline concept: A review and critique.

==Controversies==

===Credibility and validity of testimony===
The credibility of individuals with personality disorders has been questioned at least since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kluft|first1=Richard|last2=Goodwin|first2=Jean|title=Childhood Antecedents of Multiple Personality Disorder: Credibility Problems in Multiple Personality Disorder Patients and Abused Children|year=1985|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|page=2}}</ref>  Two concerns are the incidence of [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative episodes]] among people with BPD, and the belief that lying is a key component of this condition.

====Dissociation====
Researchers disagree about whether [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], or a sense of detachment from emotions and physical experiences, impacts the ability of people with BPD to recall the specifics of past events.  A 1999 study reported that the specificity of [[autobiographical memory]] was decreased in BPD patients.<ref name="Startup">{{cite journal|last=Startup|first=M.|coauthors=B. Jones, H. Heard, M.

Jones|title=Autobiographical memory and dissociation in borderline personality disorder|journal=Psychological Medicine|year=1999|month=November|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1397–1404|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=26157}}</ref> The researchers found that decreased ability to recall specifics was correlated with patients' levels of dissociation.<ref name = "Startup" /> However, a larger study in 2010 found that people with BPD and without [[major depressive disorder|depression]] had more specific autobiographical memory than did people without BPD and with depression.  The presence of depression (though not its severity) was the main factor related to a decreased ability to recall the specifics of past events.  This decreased ability was found to be unrelated to dissociation and other symptoms of BPD,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kremers|first=I.P.|coauthors=Ph. Spinhoven, A.J.W. Van der Does|title=Autobiographical memory in depressed and non-depressed patients with borderline personality disorder|journal=Clinical Psychology|year=2010|month=December|volume=43|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1348/014466504772812940|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466504772812940/abstract}}</ref> thus supporting the reliability of the testimony of people with BPD.

====Lying as a feature of BPD====
Some theorists argue that patients with BPD often lie.<ref name="Linehan 1993, p.17">Linehan 1993, p.17</ref> However, others write that they have rarely seen lying among patients with BPD in clinical practice.<ref name="Linehan 1993, p.17"/> Regardless, lying is not one of the diagnostic criteria for BPD.  

The mistaken belief that lying is a distinguishing characteristic of BPD can impact the quality of care that people with this diagnosis receive in the legal and healthcare systems.  For instance, Jean Goodwin relates an anecdote of a patient with [[multiple personality disorder]], now called [[dissociative identity disorder]], who suffered from pelvic pain due to traumatic events in her childhood.<ref name="Goodwin">{{cite book|last1=Kluft|first1=Richard|last2=Goodwin|first2=Jean|title=Childhood Antecedents of Multiple Personality Disorder: Credibility Problems in Multiple Personality Disorder Patients and Abused Children|year=1985|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|page=3}}</ref>  Due to their disbelief in her accounts of these events, physicians diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder, reflecting a belief that lying is a key feature of BPD.  Based upon her BPD diagnosis, the physicians then disregarded the patient's assertion that she was allergic to adhesive tape.  The patient was in fact allergic to adhesive tape, which later caused complications in the surgery to relieve her pelvic pain.<ref name="Goodwin" />

===Gender===
Feminist critics question why women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with BPD than men, while other stigmatizing diagnoses, such as [[antisocial personality disorder]], are diagnosed three times as often in men.<ref>Shaw and Proctor (2005), "[http://fap.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/15/4/483 Women at the Margins: A Critique of the Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder]" (PDF). ''Feminism & Psychology'' '''15''': 483–90. Retrieved 21 September 2007</ref><ref>Wirth-Cauchon, J (2001). Women and Borderline Personality Disorder: Symptoms and Stories. Rutgers University Press.ISBN 0-8135-2891-7</ref><ref group="n">{{Harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000|pp=708}}</ref>  

One explanation is that some of the diagnostic criteria of BPD uphold stereotypes about women.  For example, the criteria of "a pattern of unstable personal relationships, unstable self-image, and instability of mood," can all be linked to the stereotype that women are "neither decisive nor constant".<ref>Beauvoir, Simone.  The Second Sex New York: Vintage, 1989</ref> Women may be more likely to receive a personality disorder diagnosis if they reject the traditional female role by being assertive, successful, or sexually active.<ref name=Simmons>Simmons, D (1992) Gender issues and borderline personality disorder: Why do females dominate the diagnosis? Archives of Psychiatric Nursing, 6(4), 219–223</ref>  If a woman presents with psychiatric symptoms but does not conform to a traditional, passive [[sick role]], she may be labelled as a "difficult" patient and given a BPD diagnosis.<ref name=Simmons />

Since BPD is a stigmatizing diagnosis even within the mental health community (see [[#Stigma|Stigma]]), some feminists argue that survivors of childhood sexual abuse who are diagnosed with BPD are thus re-traumatized by the negative responses they receive from healthcare providers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nehls N |title=Borderline personality disorder: gender stereotypes, stigma, and limited system of care |journal=Issues Ment Health Nurs. |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=97–112 |year=1998 |pmid=9601307 |doi=10.1080/016128498249105}}</ref> One camp argues that it would be better to diagnose these women with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], as this would acknowledge the impact of abuse on their behavior.  Critics of the [[PTSD]] diagnosis argue that it medicalizes abuse rather than addressing the root causes in society.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Becker D |title=When she was bad: borderline personality disorder in a posttraumatic age |journal=Am J Orthopsychiatry. |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=422–32 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11086521 |doi= 10.1037/h0087769|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ort/70/4/422}}</ref>  Regardless, a diagnosis of PTSD does not encompass all aspects of the disorder (see [[#Brain abnormalities|Brain abnormalities]] and [[#Terminology|Terminology]]).

===Manipulative behavior===
[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulative behavior]] to obtain nurturance is considered by the [[diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] and many mental health professionals to be a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.<ref>DSM-IV-TR 2000, p. 705</ref>  However, [[Marsha Linehan]] notes that doing so relies upon the assumption that people with BPD who communicate intense pain, or who engage in self-harm and suicidal behavior, do so with the intention of influencing the behavior of others.<ref name = Linehanp14>Linehan 1993, p.14</ref>  The impact of such behavior on others – often an intense emotional reaction in concerned friends, family members, and therapists – is thus assumed to have been the person's intention.<ref name = Linehanp14/>

However, since people with BPD lack the ability to successfully manage painful emotions and interpersonal challenges, their frequent expressions of intense pain, self-harming, or suicidal behavior may instead represent a method of mood regulation or an escape mechanism from situations that feel unbearable.<ref>Linehan 1993, p.15</ref> Linehan notes that if, for example, one were to withhold pain medication from burn victims and cancer patients, leaving them unable to regulate their severe pain, they would also exhibit "attention-seeking" and self-destructive behavior in order to cope.<ref>Linehan 1993, p.18</ref>

===Stigma===
The features of BPD include emotional instability, intense unstable interpersonal relationships, a need for intimacy, and a fear of rejection. As a result, people with BPD often evoke intense emotions in those around them. Pejorative terms to describe people with BPD, such as "difficult," "treatment resistant," "manipulative," "demanding" and "[[attention seeking]]," are often used, and may become a self-fulfilling prophecy as the negative treatment of these individuals triggers further self-destructive behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aviram RB, Brodsky BS, Stanley B |title=Borderline personality disorder, stigma, and treatment implications |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry.|volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=249–56 |year=2006 |pmid=16990170 |doi=10.1080/10673220600975121 |url=}}</ref>

====The myth of violence====
Perhaps the most damaging aspect of the stigma surrounding borderline personality disorder is the myth that people with BPD are violent toward others.<ref name=Chapman_31>Chapman, p.31</ref>  While movies and visual media often sensationalize people with BPD by portraying them as violent, the majority of researchers agree that people with BPD are actually very unlikely to harm others.<ref name=Chapman_31/> Although people with BPD often struggle with experiences of intense anger, a defining characteristic of BPD is that they direct it inward toward themselves.<ref name=Chapman_32>Chapman, p.32</ref> In fact, one of the key differences between BPD and [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD) is that people with BPD tend to internalize anger by hurting themselves, while people with ASPD tend to externalize it by hurting others.<ref name=Chapman_32/> In addition, as adults with BPD have often experienced abuse in childhood, many people with BPD adopt a "no-tolerance" policy toward expressions of anger of any kind.<ref name=Chapman_32/> Unfortunately, their extreme aversion to violence causes many people with BPD to overcompensate and experience difficulties being assertive and expressing their needs.<ref name=Chapman_32/> This is one way in which people with BPD choose to harm themselves over potentially causing harm to others.<ref name=Chapman_32/>  Another way in which people with BPD avoid expressing their anger through violence is by causing physical damage to themselves, such as engaging in non-suicidal self injury.<ref name=reasons_NSSI /><ref name=Chapman_31/>

====Mental healthcare providers====
In psychoanalytic theory, the [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigmatization]] among mental healthcare providers may be thought to reflect [[countertransference]] (when a therapist projects their own feelings on to a client). Thus a diagnosis of BPD "often says more about the clinician's negative reaction to the patient than it does about the patient" and "explains away the breakdown in [[empathy]] between the therapist and the patient and becomes an institutional epithet in the guise of pseudoscientific jargon".<ref name=autogenerated1/> This inadvertent countertransference can give rise to inappropriate clinical responses, including excessive use of medication, inappropriate mothering, and punitive use of limit setting and interpretation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vaillant G | year = 1992 | title = The beginning of wisdom is never calling a patient Borderline | url = | journal = Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 117–34 }}</ref> 

People with BPD are considered to be among the most challenging groups of patients, requiring a high level of skill and training in the psychiatrists, therapists and nurses involved in their treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hinshelwood RD | year = 1999 | title = The difficult patient | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 174 | issue = | pages = 187–90 | pmid = 10448440 }}</ref>  A majority of psychiatric staff report finding individuals with BPD moderately to extremely difficult to work with, and more difficult than other client groups.<ref>Cleary, M.; N. Siegfried, G. Walter (September 2002). "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/ano/2002/00000011/00000003/art00007 Experience, knowledge and attitudes of mental health staff regarding clients with a borderline personality disorder]". ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Ophthalmology'' '''11''' (3): 186–191. Retrieved 23 September 2007.</ref>  

Some clients feel the diagnosis is helpful, allowing them to understand that they are not alone and to connect with others with BPD who have developed helpful coping mechanisms. However, others experience the term "Borderline Personality Disorder" as a [[pejorative]] [[labeling theory|label]] rather than an informative diagnosis. They report concerns that their self-destructive behavior is incorrectly perceived as manipulative, and that the stigma surrounding this disorder limits their access to healthcare.<ref>Nehls, N. (August 1999). "[http://ebmh.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/3/1/32#R1 Borderline personality disorder: the voice of patients]". ''Res Nurs Health'' (22): 285–93. Retrieved 23 September 2007.</ref> Indeed, mental health professionals frequently refuse to provide services to those who have received a BPD diagnosis.<ref name=Manning>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Shari|title=Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder|year=2011|publisher=The Guilford Press|pages=ix|url=http://www.amazon.com/Someone-Borderline-Personality-Disorder--Control/dp/1593856075/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358902044&sr=8-1&keywords=loving+someone+with+borderline+personality+disorder}}</ref> 

Efforts are ongoing to improve public and staff attitudes toward people with BPD.<ref>Deans, C.; E. Meocevic "[http://www.contemporarynurse.com/21.1/21.1.7.html Attitudes of registered psychiatric nurses towards patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder]". ''Contemporary Nurse''. Retrieved 23 September 2007.</ref><ref>Krawitz, R. (July 2004).

''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''38''' (7): 554. Retrieved 23 September 2007.</ref>

===Terminology===
Because of the above concerns, and because of a move away from the original theoretical basis for the term (see [[Borderline personality disorder#History|history]]), there is ongoing debate about renaming Borderline Personality Disorder. While some clinicians agree with the current name, others argue that it should be changed,<ref name="borderlinepersonalitytoday.com">{{cite news|last=Bogod|first=Elizabeth|title=Borderline Personality Disorder Label Creates Stigma|url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/label.htm|accessdate=2013}}</ref> since many who are [[labeling theory|labelled]] with "Borderline Personality Disorder" find the name unhelpful, stigmatizing, or inaccurate.<ref name="borderlinepersonalitytoday.com"/> The Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD) is campaigning to change the name and designation of BPD in the forthcoming [[DSM-5]].<ref>[http://www.tara4bpd.org Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders(TARA-APD)]</ref> The paper ''How Advocacy is Bringing BPD into the Light''<ref>http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=35 How Advocacy is Bringing BPD into the Light</ref> reports that "the name BPD is confusing, imparts no relevant or descriptive information, and reinforces existing stigma."

Alternative suggestions for names include ''emotional regulation disorder'' or ''[[emotional dysregulation]] disorder''. ''Impulse disorder'' and ''interpersonal regulatory disorder'' are other valid alternatives, according to John Gunderson of [[McLean Hospital]] in the United States.<ref>Gunderson, John G. M.D., Hoffman, Perry D., PhD ''Understanding and Treating Borderline Personality Disorder A Guide for Professionals and Families'' Arlington, Virginia, American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2005</ref> Another term suggested by psychiatrist Carolyn Quadrio is ''post traumatic personality disorganization'' (PTPD), reflecting the condition's status as (often) both a form of chronic [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) as well as a personality disorder.<ref name="AxisOne/AxisTwo">Quadrio, C. (December 2005). "Axis One/Axis Two: A disordered borderline". ''Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''39''' (Suppl. 1): 141–156.</ref>  However, although many with BPD do have traumatic histories, some do not report any kind of traumatic event, which suggests that BPD is not necessarily a trauma spectrum disorder.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=Alex|last2=Gratz|first2=Kim|title=The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD|year=2007|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|page=52|url=http://www.amazon.com/Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Survival-Guide/dp/1572245077/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358822114&sr=8-1&keywords=borderline+personality+disorder+survival+guide}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Film and television===
There are several films portraying characters either explicitly diagnosed or with traits suggestive of BPD. The films ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''<ref>{{cite book |title=Reel Psychiatry: Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions|author=Robinson, David J. |year= 2003|publisher=Rapid Psychler Press |location=Port Huron, Michigan |isbn=1-894328-07-8|page=234}}</ref> and ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' are two examples,<ref name="RobinsonFG">{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = David J.| title = The Field Guide to Personality Disorders| publisher = Rapid Psychler Press| year = 1999| page =113| isbn = 0-9680324-6-X}}</ref> as is the movie ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]],'' based on the [[Girl, Interrupted|memoir]] by [[Susanna Kaysen]], with [[Winona Ryder]] playing Kaysen. Each of these films suggests the emotional instability of the disorder; however, the first two cases show a person more aggressive to others than to herself, which is less typical of the disorder.<ref>{{cite book |title=Movies and Mental Illness: Using Films to Understand Psychopathology |author=Wedding D, Boyd MA, Niemiec RM |year=2005 |publisher=Hogrefe |location=Cambridge,MA |isbn=0-88937-292-6 |page=59}}</ref> The 1992 film ''[[Single White Female]]'' suggests different aspects of the disorder: the character Hedy suffers from a markedly disturbed sense of identity and, as with the first two films, abandonment leads to drastic measures.<ref>Robinson (''Reel Psychiatry: Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions''), p. 235</ref>

Psychiatrists Eric Bui and Rachel Rodgers argue that the character of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria; Bui also found Anakin a useful example to explain BPD to medical students. In particular, Bui points to the character's abandonment issues, uncertainty over his identity, and dissociative episodes.<ref name="BPD paper">{{Cite news|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|title=The Psychology of Darth Vader Revealed|url=http://www.livescience.com/culture/psychology-darth-vader-revealed-100604.html|publisher=TopTenReviews|work=[[LiveScience]]|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> Other films attempting to depict characters with the disorder include ''[[The Crush (1993 film)|The Crush]]'', ''[[Mad Love (1995 film)|Mad Love]]'', ''[[Malicious (1996 film)|Malicious]]'', ''[[Interiors]]'', ''[[Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes On a Scandal]]'', ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'' and ''[[Cracks (film)|Cracks]]''.<ref name="RobinsonFG"/> 

Unfortunately, dramatic portrayals of people with BPD in movies and other forms of visual media contribute to the stigma surrounding borderline personality disorder, especially the myth that people with BPD are violent toward others.<ref name=Chapman_31>Chapman, p.31</ref>  The majority of researchers agree that in reality, people with BPD are very unlikely to harm others.<ref name=Chapman_31/> See [[#The myth of violence|The myth of violence]] under [[#Stigma|Stigma]].

===Literature===
''The Buddha and the Borderline: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder through Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Buddhism, and Online Dating'' is a memoir by Kiera Van Gelder.

''[[Girl, Interrupted]]'' is a memoir by American author [[Susanna Kaysen]], relating her experiences as a young woman in a psychiatric hospital in the 1960s after being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. 

''Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder'' is a memoir by author Rachel Reiland, relating her treatment and recovery from borderline personality disorder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon.com|url=http://www.amazon.com/Get-Out-Here-Borderline-Personality/dp/1592850995/ref=la_B001K86VAO_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358677770&sr=1-1|accessdate=2013}}</ref>  

''Songs of Three Islands'', by Millicent Monks, is a memoir speculating about the impact of BPD upon the [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie family]].  Readers have criticized it for presenting a biased and stigmatizing view of BPD.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reader Reviews|last=Morgenzstern|first=Mathilde|url=http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Three-Islands-Illness-American/product-reviews/1934633348/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8&filterBy=addOneStar&showViewpoints=0}}</ref>

In [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Vorkosigan Saga#Komarr|Komarr]]'', [[Ekaterin_Vorsoisson#Etienne Vorsoisson|Tien Vorsoisson]] has BPD, per the author; his disorder drives a large part of the story.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lists.herald.co.uk/old-archives/lois-bujold/990719-2552 | title=LOIS-BUJOLD Digest 2552, 4th msg.: _Komarr_ , Tien, and Borderline Personality |author= Lois McMaster Bujold | publisher=http://lists.herald.co.uk | date=July, 1999 | accessdate=September 9, 2011}}</ref>

===Awareness===
In early 2008, the [[United States House of Representatives]] declared the month of May as Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month.<ref>HR 1005, 4/1/08</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/awareness/awareness-files/background.shtml |title= BPD Awareness Month – Congressional History |work= BPD Today |publisher= Mental Health Today |accessdate= 2010-11-01 }}</ref>
