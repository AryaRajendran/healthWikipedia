'''Red wine headache ("RWH")''' is a [[headache]] often accompanied by [[nausea]] and [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] that occurs in many people after drinking even a single glass of [[red wine]]. This [[syndrome]] can sometimes develop within 15 minutes of consumption of the wine. 

The condition does not occur after consumption of [[white wine]] or other alcoholic beverages.  Some individuals report that they get a [[migraine]] headache hours later from drinking some red wines.  No one knows for certain why this syndrome occurs.  It probably has more than one cause.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

== Sulfites ==

Since wines contain a warning label about [[sulfites]] many people have assumed that sulfites are the cause of RWH. This is not the case.<ref name="MacNeil pg 34"> K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 34 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1-56305-434-5</ref>  Almost all wine contains sulfites.  Many sweet white wines have more sulfites than red wines.  [[Dried fruit]] and processed food like lunchmeat have far more sulfites than red wine.  Less than 1% of the population is sensitive to sulfites.

There are sulfite sensitive individuals who have asthma problems from red wine and dried fruit (such as apricots and golden raisins) that have added (not just natural) sulfites.  Some of these sulfite sensitive individuals generally do not have asthma problems from red wine that only has sulfites naturally inherent to the grapes.

== Histamines ==

Red wine has 20â€“200% more histamines than white wine, and those who are [[allergy|allergic]] to them are deficient in a certain [[enzyme]]. Some experts believe that the combination of alcohol and that deficiency could cause headaches. However, a study of 16 people with an intolerance to red wine, reported in the ''[[Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology]]'' (Feb 2001), found no difference in reactions to low and high histamine wines.  Taking [[loratadine]] (Claritin) an hour before drinking should reduce the reaction to histamines and the resulting symptoms.  This would tell an individual whether histamines were the cause of their problem.

== Tannins ==

Other experts{{Who|date=March 2010}} think [[tannins (wine)|tannins]] are the cause of RWH. Tannins are the [[flavonoids]] in wine that give its degree of mouth-drying bitterness.  The taste is the same as when you bite into a grape skin. Tannin is a chemical substance that comes from grape skins, stems, and seeds.  The skins also impart color to wine, which is why red wines typically have a lot more tannin than whites. Red wines are fermented while in contact with the skins and seeds. Modern winemakers take care to minimize undesirable tannins from seeds by crushing grapes gently when extracting their juice.

Wines can also take on tannins from the oak or other woods used in wine barrels for storage. Different woods in different countries affect the type of tannins in the wine.    

Tannins help prevent [[oxidation]], an important role in a wine's aging potential. As age-worthy red wines mature, tannin molecules gradually accumulate and precipitate out of the wine in the sediment.   

Certain wine styles have much less tannin content than others, due to reduced maceration time (grape juice contact with the grape pulp, including sources of tannin such as stems, seeds). [[Grape variety|Grape varieties]] like [[Pinot Noir]], [[Sangiovese]], [[Gamay]] (Beaujolais), [[Tempranillo]], and the [[Italian wine|Italian]] grapes [[Dolcetto]] and [[Barbera]], are less tannic. Also, grapes grown in certain [[wine regions]] are less tannic, like [[French wine|French]] reds from [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], and [[Spanish wine regions]] like [[Rioja (wine)|Spanish Riojas]].

[[French wine|French]] reds from [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], and Italian reds like Barolo and Barbaresco, are particularly tannic. Vintage [[port (alcohol)|port]] is also very tannic when young, as are wines made from the syrah (shiraz) and [[cabernet sauvignon]] grapes.  

A quick way to identify these lower tannic wine bottles on a store shelf is to look for the sloped shoulder "Burgundy bottle".  This is specially true for European wines, but several new world wineries have also adopted traditional bottle shapes to help consumers distinguish their wines.

There is a difference between the varieties and brands of red wine and the amount one can consume before the headache occurs, but the reports have not been consistent from person to person.  Considering how the amount of tannins changes with aging, this would not be surprising.

The ''Harvard Health Letter'' notes several well-controlled experiments showing that tannins cause the release of [[serotonin]], a [[neurotransmitter]]. High levels of serotonin can cause headaches and that may happen in people who also suffer from [[migraine]] headaches. But that does not explain why people who do not get migraines get RWH. 

The tannins that are extracted from grapes found in red wine are primarily condensed tannins which are polymers of procyanidin monomers. Hydrolysable tannins are extracted from the oak wood the wine is aged in. Hydrolysable tannins are more easily oxidised than condensed tannins.

== Prostaglandins ==

RWH could be caused by the release of [[prostaglandins]] which some people are not able to metabolize.  Prostaglandins are substances that can contribute to pain and swelling. [[Ibuprofen]] (Advil), [[paracetamol]] (Tylenol) and aspirin are prostaglandin inhibitors.  Some people get good results taking a dose of an inhibitor an hour before consuming red wine. Aspirin and ibuprofen were shown to be effective at blocking both early and late stages of the RWH, and paracetamol (acetaminophen) was effective in blocking the early stage. It should be noted that paracetamol and alcohol are not good for the liver, and can be potentially harmful. <ref>Kaufman and D. Starr, Prevention of the Red Wine Headache (RWH); A Blind Controlled Study. In New Advances in Headache Research, 2nd edition, ed. F. Clifford Rose. Smith-Gordon, 1991.</ref>

==Tyramine==

Tyramine may well be a major player in RWH syndrome. Tyramine is an amine that is produced naturally from the breakdown of protein as food ages. More specifically it is formed by the decarboxylation of the amino acid tyrosine. It is found in aged, fermented, and spoiled foods. Everyday foods we consume including aged cheeses, overripe and dried fruit, sauerkraut, soy, and many processed foods contain high levels of tyramine. Tyramine is suspected of inducing migraine headaches in about 40% of migraine sufferers, according to F.G.Freitag of Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago.{{cn|date=November 2012}}

== Other possibilities ==

It has also been postulated {{Who|date=October 2009}} that RWH could be caused by a [[yeast in winemaking|strain of yeast]] or [[bacteria]] found in red wine.
