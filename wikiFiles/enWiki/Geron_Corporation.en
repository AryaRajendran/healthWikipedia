'''Geron Corporation''' is a [[biotechnology]] company located in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California that specializes in developing and commercialization of products in three specific areas: 1) therapeutic products for cancer that inhibit [[telomerase]]; 2) pharmaceuticals that activate telomerase in tissues impacted by cell aging, injury or degenerative diseases; and 3) cell-based therapies derived from human embryonic stem cells for treatment of various chronic diseases.<ref>[http://www.geron.com Geron corporate web site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Drug candidates==
===Cancer therapies===

Currently, Geron Corporation has two anti-cancer products in human clinical trials. The first, called GRN163L, is a drug that targets telomerase and has been shown to be effective in treating various cancers in animals.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Dec_12/ai_n15929902 Geron Announces Data on the Effects of Its Cancer Drug, GRN163L, on Multiple Myeloma at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting]</ref> In studies conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]], GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks. Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the ''[[in vitro]]'' clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with [[multiple myeloma]]. Presently Geron is recruiting patients for six clinical trials using GRN163L,<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?intr=GRN163L Search for GRN163L on ClinicalTrials.gov]</ref> including lung cancer, chronic [[lymphocytic leukemia]]<ref>[http://clinicaltrial.gov/ct/show/NCT00124189?order=2 ClinicalTrials.gov: Safety and Dose Study of GRN163L Administered Weekly to Treat Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and solid tumors.<ref>[http://clinicaltrial.gov/ct/show/NCT00310895?order=3 ClinicalTrials.gov: Safety and Dose Study of GRN163L Administered Weekly to Treat Patients With Solid Tumor Malignancies]</ref>    Also in trials at Duke University is GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with [[prostate cancer]]. With the vaccine, Geron plans to inject telomerase into the patient with metastatic prostate cancer to induce the body to produce a more aggressive immune response to the cancer. This vaccine has also produced significant initial results. Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from [[Merck & Co.|Merck]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2005/09/12/daily2.html | title=Geron plans stock offering, Merck buying $18M in shares | date=12 September 2005}}</ref>

===Telomerase Activation===

In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular [[senescence]].  The company is in the early stages of developing a telomerase based treatment for [[HIV]] called TAT0002, which is the [[saponin]] [[cycloastragenol]] in Chinese herb [[Astragalus propinquus]].<ref>[http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/181/10/7400 TAT2 (cycloastragenol, CAS Registry no. 84605-18-5)]</ref>  Geron has granted a license to [http://www.tasciences.com TAsciences.com] to sell [[TA-65]], the telomerase activator agent also derived from [[astragalus]]. In October 2010 Intertek/AAC Labs, an ISO 17025 internationally recognized lab, found the largest component of TA-65 to be Cycloastragenol.<ref>American Analytical Chemistry Laboratories Analysis Document #100710-236 of [http://www.CycloAstragenol.com/ TA-65]</ref>

Geron originally investigated telomerase as a means of understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind. <sup>[[citation needed]]</sup>

===Stem cell therapies===

On January 23, 2009, Geron received [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval to begin [[Clinical_trial#Phase_I|Phase I]] testing of GRNOPC1 in humans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html | work=Forbes | title=Despite Bush Veto, Stem Cell Research Abounds - Forbes.com | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=May 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>  GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of [[spinal cord injury]] through remyelination of damaged axons.  This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of [[oligodendrocyte]] progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells.<ref name="pmid15888645">{{cite journal |author=Keirstead HS, Nistor G, Bernal G, ''et al.'' |title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell transplants remyelinate and restore locomotion after spinal cord injury |journal=J.

<br>Geron also has several other embryonic [[stem cell treatments]] that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for [[heart disease]], and GRNIC1, a treatment for [[diabetes]].  In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished.<ref>[http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=3153413 News: Geron Presents New Data That Document Progress in Development of Therapeutic Products from Human Embryonic Stem Cells.

====GRNOPC1====

As of October and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been [[GRNOPC1]], a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries.  The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early [[myelinated]] [[glial cells]], a type of cell that insulates [[nerve cells]].  For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months.<ref>http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/11/first-human-injected-in-human-embryonic-stem-cell-trial/?replytocom=86296 CNN Rachel Meade Reports (October 13, 2010)</ref>
In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scimitarequity.com/blog/2011/10/20/geron-gern-updates-clinical-data-from-grnopc1-spinal-cord-injury-trial/ |title=Geron (GERN) updates Clinical Data from GRNOPC1 Spinal Cord Injury Trial |date=20 Oct 2011}}</ref> The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011. (See [[Human_embryonic_stem_cells_clinical_trials#Geron_Spinal_Cord_Injury_Trial]])
<br />

As of 24th of July 2012, Geron appear to have stopped work on stem cell technology due to financial constraints.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|title=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15740133|work=Daily Events|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

==Patents==

Since it was organized in 1990 Geron has been granted over 260 patents.<ref>[http://www.geron.com/showpage.asp?code=prodpa Geron - Patents<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Patent issue===
Geron Corporation initially held exclusive rights to three cell types derived from embryonic stem cells, as the result of paying for the research originally conducted by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|Dr. James Thomson]] at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.<ref>[http://badgerherald.com/news/2002/01/22/warf_geron_reach_set.php The Badger Herald - WARF, Geron reach settlement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The patents on the other three cell types are owned by the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF). WARF and Geron did not charge academics to study human stem cells but did charge commercial users. In 2001 WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology, and they launched legal action against Geron Corporation to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron would keep the rights to only three cell types.<ref>[http://www.genetics-and-society.org/newsdisp.asp?id=1033 Center for Genetics and Society : How a University's Patents May Limit Stem-Cell Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In October 2006, a legal challenge was mounted to overturn these patents by The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and the non-profit patent-watchdog [[Public Patent Foundation]].<ref>[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/718/2 _Science_, 2006]</ref> They contended that two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the molecular biologist Jeanne Loring who stated that [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] stem cell pioneer [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]]'s techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/stemcells/2007/0711/071108/full/stemcells.2007.113.html Nature Reports Stem Cells 8 November 2007]</ref> The outcome of this legal challenge was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.<ref>[http://www.genetics-and-society.org/newsdisp.asp?id=1039 Center for Genetics and Society : Stem Cell Patents Come Under Fire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.<ref>[http://www.warf.org/news/news.jsp?news_id=234 WARF press release]</ref>

As an interim measure, on January 23, 2007 WARF relaxed the stem cell patents, allowing industry-sponsored research at academic and non-profit institutions without a license.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/biotech/20070123-9999-1b23stems.html SignOnSanDiego.com > News > Business > Biotechnology - Stem cell scientists shout out hallelujah<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> WARF will allow easier and simpler cost free cell transfers among researchers and would not require a license or agreement from California's taxpayer-funded stem cell research program.<ref>http://www.pubpat.org/warfstemcelleased.htm</ref>

==Politics==
As a participant in the [[stem cell controversy|then-controversial]] stem cell and cloning area, Geron Corporation was asked to testify about its technology before the U.S. Congress.  In 2001, when Congress was attempting to ban all forms of cloning, Geron [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Thomas Okarma]] spoke before Congress to preserve cloning for therapeutic purposes.
