The '''porphyrias''' are a group of rare inherited or acquired disorders of certain [[enzyme]]s that normally participate in the production of [[porphyrin]]s and [[heme]]. They manifest with either neurological complications or skin problems, or occasionally both.

Porphyrias are classified in two ways, by symptoms and by pathophysiology.  Symptomatically, '''acute porphyrias''' primarily present with nervous system involvement, often with severe [[abdominal pain]], [[vomiting]], [[neuropathy]] and mental disturbances.  '''Cutaneous porphyrias''' present with skin manifestations often after exposure to sun due to the accumulation of excess porphyrins near the surface of the skin.<ref name=saudubray>{{cite book |last1=Lourenco |first1=Charles Marquez |last2=Lee |first2=Chul |last3=Anderson |first3=Karl E. |editor1-first=Jean-Marie |editor1-last=Saudubray |editor2-first=Georges |editor2-last=van den Berghe |editor3-first=John H. |others= |title=Inborn Metabolic Diseases:  Diagnosis and Treatment |edition=5th |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |language=English |isbn= 978-3-642-15719-6 | pages=521–532 |chapter=Disorders of Haem Biosynthesis |editor-last=Walter}}</ref>  Physiologically, porphyrias are classified as hepatic or erythropoietic based on the sites of accumulation of [[heme]] precursors, either in the [[liver]] or [[bone marrow]] and [[red blood cells]].<ref name=saudubray />

The term "porphyria" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πορφύρα, ''porphyra,'' meaning "[[purple]] [[pigment]]". The name is likely to have been a reference to the purple discolouration of feces and urine when exposed to light in patients during an attack.<ref name=Lane>{{Cite web| author=Nick Lane | title=Born to the purple: the story of porphyria | work=Scientific American | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000B1BEF-C051-1DF8-9733809EC588EEDF | date=2002-12-16 | accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> Although original descriptions are attributed to [[Hippocrates]], the disease was first explained biochemically by [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]] in 1871,<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Hoppe-Seyler F | title=Das Hämatin | journal=Tubinger Med-Chem Untersuch | year=1871| volume=4 | pages=523–33}}</ref> and acute porphyrias were described by the Dutch physician [[Barend Joseph Stokvis|Barend Stokvis]] in 1889.<ref name=Lane/><ref>{{Cite journal| author=Stokvis BJ | title=Over twee zeldzame kleurstoffen in urine van zieken |journal=Nederl Tijdschr Geneeskd | volume=2 | pages=409–417  |language=Dutch}} Reprinted in {{Cite journal|author=Stokvis BJ |title=Over twee zeldzame kleurstoffen in urine van zieken |language=Dutch |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=133 |issue=51 |pages=2562–70 |year=1989 |month=December |pmid=2689889 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
===Acute porphyrias===
The acute, or hepatic, porphyrias primarily affect the [[nervous system]], resulting in [[abdominal pain]], [[vomiting]], acute [[neuropathy]], muscle weakness, [[seizure]]s, and mental disturbances, including [[hallucination]]s, [[clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[paranoia]]. [[Cardiac arrhythmia]]s and [[tachycardia]] (high heart rate) may develop as the [[autonomic nervous system]] is affected. Pain can be severe and can, in some cases, be both acute and chronic in nature. [[Constipation]] is frequently present, as the nervous system of the gut is affected, but [[diarrhoea]] can also occur.

Given the many presentations and the relatively low occurrence of porphyria, the patient may initially be suspected to have other, unrelated conditions. For instance, the polyneuropathy of acute porphyria may be mistaken for [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], and porphyria testing is commonly recommended in those situations.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Albers JW, Fink JK |title=Porphyric neuropathy |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=410–422 |year=2004 |pmid=15372536 |doi=10.1002/mus.20137}}</ref> [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] features photosensitivity and pain attacks and shares various other symptoms with porphyria.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Roelandts R |title=The diagnosis of photosensitivity |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=136 |issue=9 |pages=1152–1157 |year=2000 |pmid=10987875| doi = 10.1001/archderm.136.9.1152}}</ref>

Not all porphyrias are genetic, and patients with liver disease who develop porphyria as a result of liver dysfunction may exhibit other signs of their condition, such as [[jaundice]].

Patients with acute porphyria ([[acute intermittent porphyria|AIP]], [[hereditary coproporphyria|HCP]], [[variegate porphyria|VP]]) are at increased risk over their life for [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] (primary liver cancer) and may require monitoring. Other typical risk factors for liver cancer need not be present.

===Cutaneous porphyrias===
The [[cutaneous]], or [[erythropoietic]], porphyrias primarily affect the [[skin]], causing [[photosensitivity]] ([[photodermatitis]]), [[blister]]s, [[necrosis]] of the skin and gums, itching, and swelling, and increased hair growth on areas such as the forehead. Often there is no abdominal pain, distinguishing it from other porphyrias.

In some forms of porphyria, accumulated heme precursors excreted in the urine may cause various changes in color, after exposure to sunlight, to a dark reddish or dark brown color. Even a purple hue or red urine may be seen.

==Diagnosis==
===Porphyrin studies===
Porphyria is diagnosed through biochemical analysis of [[blood]], [[urine]], and [[feces|stool]].<ref name=Thadani>{{Cite journal|author=Thadani H, Deacon A, Peters T |title=Diagnosis and management of porphyria |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7250 |pages=1647–1651 |year=2000 |pmid=10856069 |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7250.1647 |pmc=1127427}}</ref> In general, urine estimation of [[porphobilinogen]] (PBG) is the first step if acute porphyria is suspected.  As a result of feedback, the decreased production of heme leads to increased production of precursors, PBG being one of the first substances in the porphyrin synthesis pathway.<ref name=Anderson>{{Cite journal|author=Anderson KE |title=Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute porphyrias |journal=Ann.

Med. |volume=142 |issue=6 |pages=439–50 |year=2005 |pmid=15767622|author-separator=,|author2=Bloomer JR|author3=Bonkovsky HL|display-authors=3|last4=Kushner|first4=JP|last5=Pierach|first5=CA|last6=Pimstone|first6=NR|last7=Desnick|first7=RJ }}</ref>  In nearly all cases of acute porphyria syndromes, urinary PBG is markedly elevated except for the very rare [[ALA dehydratase deficiency]] or in patients with symptoms due to [[tyrosinemia|hereditary tyrosinemia type I]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  In cases of
[[mercury poisoning|mercury]]- or [[arsenic poisoning]]-induced porphyria, other changes in porphyrin profiles appear, most notably elevations of uroporphyrins I & III, coproporphyrins I & III and pre-coproporphyrin.<ref name=Woods1995>{{Cite book| last = Woods| first = J.S.| contribution = Porphyrin metabolism as indicator of metal exposure and toxicity| editor-last = Goyer| editor-first = R.A. & Cherian, M.G.| title = Toxicology of metals, biochemical aspects| volume = 115| pages = 19–52, Chapter 2| publisher = Springer| place = Berlin| year = 1995 }}</ref>

Repeat testing during an attack and subsequent attacks may be necessary in order to detect a porphyria, as levels may be normal or near-normal between attacks. The urine screening test has been known to fail in the initial stages of a severe life threatening attack of [[acute intermittent porphyria]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The bulk (up to 90%) of the genetic carriers of the more common, dominantly inherited acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary [[coproporphyria]], variegate porphyria) have been noted in DNA tests to be latent for classic symptoms and may require [[DNA]] or [[enzyme]] testing. The exception to this may be latent post-puberty genetic carriers of hereditary [[coproporphyria]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

As most porphyrias are [[rare disease|rare conditions]], general hospital labs typically do not have the expertise, technology or staff time to perform porphyria testing. In general, testing involves sending samples of blood, stool and urine to a reference laboratory.<ref name=Thadani/> All samples to detect porphyrins must be handled properly. Samples should be taken during an acute attack, otherwise a [[false negative]] result may occur. Samples must be protected from light and either refrigerated or preserved.<ref name=Thadani/>

If all the porphyrin studies are negative, one has to consider [[pseudoporphyria]].  A careful medication review often will find the inciting cause of [[pseudoporphyria]].

===Additional tests===
Further diagnostic tests of affected organs may be required, such as [[nerve conduction studies]] for [[neuropathy]] or an [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the liver. Basic biochemical tests may assist in identifying [[liver disease]], [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], and other organ problems.

==Pathogenesis==
In [[human]]s, [[porphyrin]]s are the main precursors of [[heme]], an essential constituent of [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]], [[catalase]], [[peroxidase]], respiratory and P450 liver [[cytochrome]]s.

[[File:Heme synthesis.svg|thumb|right|350px|Heme synthesis—note that some reactions occur in the [[cytoplasm]] and some in the [[mitochondrion]] (yellow)]]

Deficiency in the [[enzymes]] of the porphyrin pathway leads to insufficient production of [[heme]]. [[Heme]] function plays a central role in cellular [[metabolism]]. This is not the main problem in the porphyrias; most [[heme]] [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] [[enzymes]]—even dysfunctional [[enzymes]]—have enough residual activity to assist in [[heme]] biosynthesis. The principal problem in these deficiencies is the accumulation of [[porphyrins]], the [[heme]] precursors, which are toxic to tissue in high concentrations. The chemical properties of these intermediates determine the location of accumulation, whether they induce [[photosensitivity]], and whether the intermediate is excreted (in the [[urine]] or [[feces]]).

There are eight [[enzyme]]s in the [[heme]] biosynthetic pathway, four of which—the first one and the last three—are in the [[mitochondria]], while the other four are in the [[cytosol]]. Defects in any of these can lead to some form of porphyria.

The [[hepatic porphyria]]s are characterized by acute neurological attacks ([[seizure]]s, [[psychosis]], extreme [[back pain|back]] and [[abdominal pain]] and an acute [[polyneuropathy]]), while the [[Erythropoietic porphyria|erythropoietic forms]] present with skin problems, usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and [[hypertrichosis|increased hair growth]].

''[[Variegate porphyria]]'' (also ''porphyria variegata'' or ''mixed porphyria''), which results from a partial deficiency in [[PROTO oxidase]], manifests itself with skin lesions similar to those of [[porphyria cutanea tarda]] combined with acute neurologic attacks. All other porphyrias are either skin- or nerve-predominant.

===Subtypes===
Subtypes of porphyrias depend on what enzyme is deficient.

==Treatment==
===Acute porphyria===
====Carbohydrates and heme====
Often, empirical treatment is required if the diagnostic suspicion of a porphyria is high since acute attacks can be fatal. A high-carbohydrate diet is typically recommended; in severe attacks, a [[glucose]] 10% infusion is commenced, which may aid in recovery.

[[Hematin]] (trade name Panhematin) and [[heme arginate]] (trade name NormoSang) are the drugs of choice in acute porphyria, in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], respectively. These drugs need to be given ''very early'' in an attack to be effective; effectiveness varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of NormoSang are kept at two national centers; emergency supply is available from [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London.<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary]] (BNF 57) |year=2009 |month=March |publisher=[[BMJ Group]] and RPS Publishing |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-85369-845-6 |page=549 |chapter=9.8.2: Acute porphyrias |author8=[[British Medical Association]], [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]]}}</ref> In the United States, [[Lundbeck]] manufactures and supplies Panhematin for infusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.porphyriafoundation.com/testing-and-treatment/medications-for-porphyria/panhematin |title=Panhematin for Acute Porphyria |year=2010 |author=American Porphyria Foundation |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref>

Heme Arginate (NormoSang) is used during crises but also in preventive treatment to avoid crises, one treatment every 10 days

Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or weakness should be treated with the addition of [[hematin]] or [[heme arginate]] or even [[Tin Mesoporphyrin]] as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Cimetidine has also been reported to be effective for acute porphyric crisis and possibly effective for long term prophylaxis. .<ref> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16263899/</ref>

====Precipitating factors====
If drugs or hormones have caused the attack, discontinuing the offending substances is essential. [[Infection]] is one of the top causes of attacks and requires immediate and vigorous treatment.

====Symptom control====
Pain is severe, frequently out of proportion to physical signs and often requires the use of [[opiates]] to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible, due to its severity. [[Nausea]] can be severe; it may respond to [[phenothiazine]] drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot water baths/showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls.

====Early identification====
It is recommended that patients with a history of acute porphyria, and even genetic carriers, wear an [[Medical identification tag|alert bracelet]] or other identification at all times.  This is in case they develop severe symptoms, or in case of accidents where there is a potential for drug exposure, and as a result they are unable to explain their condition to healthcare professionals. Some drugs are absolutely [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] for any patients with any porphyria.

====Neurologic and psychiatric problems====
Patients who experience frequent attacks can develop chronic [[neuropathic]] pain in extremities as well as chronic pain in the gut. Gut [[dysmotility]], [[ileus]], [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]], [[hypoganglionosis]], [[encopresis]] in children and intestinal pseudo-obstruction have been associated with porphyrias. This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system and vagal nerve dysfunction.

In these cases treatment with long-acting [[opioid]]s may be indicated. Some cases of chronic pain can be difficult to manage and may require treatment using multiple modalities. Opioid dependence may develop.

[[Clinical depression|Depression]] often accompanies the disease and is best dealt with by treating the offending symptoms and if needed the judicious use of [[anti-depressant]]s. Some psychotropic drugs are porphyrinogenic, limiting the therapeutic scope.

====Seizures====
[[Seizures]] often accompany this disease. Most seizure medications exacerbate this condition. Treatment can be problematic: [[barbiturate]]s especially must be avoided. Some [[benzodiazepine]]s are safe and, when used in conjunction with newer anti-seizure medications such as [[gabapentin]], offer a possible regime for seizure control.

[[Magnesium sulfate]] and bromides have also been used in porphyria seizures, however, development of status epilepticus in porphyria may not respond to magnesium alone. The addition of [[hematin]] or [[heme arginate]] has been used during [[status epilepticus]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

====Underlying liver disease====
Some liver diseases may cause porphyria even in the absence of genetic predisposition. These include [[hemochromatosis]] and [[hepatitis C]]. Treatment of iron overload may be required.

====Hormone treatment====
Hormonal fluctuations that contribute to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with oral contraceptives and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of oral contraceptives has triggered attacks.  [[Androgens]] and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks.

===Erythropoietic porphyrias===
These are associated with accumulation of porphyrins in erythrocytes and are rare. The rarest is Congenital erythropoetic porphyria (C.E.P) otherwise known as [[Gunther's disease]].  The signs may present from birth and include severe photosensitivity, brown teeth that fluoresce in ultraviolet light due to deposition of type one porphyrins and later [[hypertrichosis]]. Hemolytic anemia usually develops. Pharmaceutical-grade [[beta carotene]] may be used in its treatment.<ref>Martin A Crook.2006. Clinical chemistry and Metabolic Medicine. seventh edition. Hodder Arnold. ISBN 0-340-90616-2</ref> A bone marrow transplant has also been successful in curing CEP in a few cases, although long term results are not yet available.<ref name="pmid18186900">{{Cite journal|author=Faraci M |title=Unrelated HSCT in an adolescent affected by congenital erythropoietic porphyria |journal=Pediatr Transplant |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=117–120 |year=2008 |pmid=18186900 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-3046.2007.00842.x|author-separator=,|author2=Morreale G|author3=Boeri E|display-authors=3|last4=Lanino|first4=Edoardo|last5=Dallorso|first5=Sandro|last6=Dini|first6=Giorgio|last7=Scuderi|first7=Francesca|last8=Cohen|first8=Amnon|last9=Cappelli|first9=Barbara}}</ref>

The pain, burning, swelling and itching that occur in erythropoietic porphyrias generally require avoidance of bright sunlight. Most kinds of [[sunscreen]] are not effective, but SPF-rated long-sleeve shirts, hats, bandanas and gloves can help.  [[Chloroquine]] may be used to increase porphyrin secretion in some EPs.<ref name=Thadani/> [[Blood transfusion]] is occasionally used to suppress innate heme production.

==Epidemiology==
The [[prevalence]] of all types of porphyria taken together has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 25,000 in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/957765-overview#target2 eMedicine > Porphyria, Cutaneous] Authors: Vikramjit S Kanwar, Thomas G DeLoughery, Richard E Frye and Darius J Adams. Updated: Jul 27, 2010</ref> The worldwide prevalence has been estimated to be somewhere between 1 in 500 to 1 in 50,000 people.<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=porphyria Genetics Home Reference > Porphyria] Reviewed July 2009</ref>

==Culture and history==
Porphyrias have been detected in all races, multiple ethnic groups on every  continent including [[African people|Africans]], [[Asian people|Asians]], [[Australian aborigines]], [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], [[Peru]]vian, [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and [[Sami people|Sami]].  There are high incidence reports of AIP in areas of India and Scandinavia and over 200 genetic variants of AIP, some of which are specific to families, although some strains have proven to be repeated mutations.

The links between porphyrias and mental illness have been noted for decades.  In the early 1950s patients with porphyrias (occasionally referred to as "Porphyric Hemophilia"<ref>Denver, Joness. "An Encyclopaedia of Obscure Medicine". Published by University Books, Inc., 1959.</ref>) and severe symptoms of depression or catatonia were treated with [[electroshock]].

===Vampires and werewolves===
Porphyria has been suggested as an explanation for the origin of [[vampire]] and [[werewolf]] legends, based upon certain perceived similarities between the condition and the [[folklore]].

In January 1964, L. Illis' 1963 paper, "On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werwolves", was published in ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]]''. Later, [[Nancy Garden]] argued for a connection between porphyria and the vampire belief in her 1973 book, ''Vampires''. In 1985, biochemist [[David Dolphin]]'s paper for the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], "Porphyria, Vampires, and Werewolves: The Aetiology of European Metamorphosis Legends", gained widespread media coverage, thus popularizing the idea.

The theory has been rejected by folklorists and researchers as not accurately describing the characteristics of the original werewolf and vampire legends or the disease and for potentially stigmatizing sufferers of porphyria.<ref>''American Vampires: Fans, Victims, Practitioners'', Norine Dresser, W. W. Norton & Company, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1321/did-vampires-suffer-from-the-disease-porphyria-or-not "Did vampires suffer from the disease porphyria — or not?"] [[The Straight Dope]], May 7, 1999,</ref>

==Notable cases==
[[File:George III in Coronation edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in his coronation robes]]

The mental illness exhibited by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] evidenced in the regency crisis of 1788 has inspired several attempts at [[retrospective diagnosis]]. The first, written in 1855, thirty-five years after his death, concluded he suffered from acute [[mania]]. M. Guttmacher, in 1941, suggested [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive]] [[psychosis]] as a more likely diagnosis. The first suggestion that a physical illness was the cause of King George's mental derangements came in 1966, in a paper "The Insanity of King George III: A Classic Case of Porphyria",<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Macalpine I, Hunter R |title=The "insanity" of King George 3d: a classic case of porphyria |journal=[[Br Med J]] |volume=1 |issue=5479 |pages=65–71 |year=1966 |month=January |pmid=5323262 |pmc=1843211 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.5479.65|url=}}</ref> with a follow-up in 1968, "Porphyria in the Royal Houses of Stuart, Hanover and Prussia".<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Macalpine I, Hunter R, Rimington C |title=Porphyria in the royal houses of Stuart, Hanover, and Prussia.

Many psychiatrists disagreed with Hunter's diagnosis, suggesting bipolar disorder as far more probable.

The mental illness of George III is the basis of the plot in ''[[The Madness of King George]]'', a 1994 British film based upon the 1991 [[Alan Bennett]] play, ''The Madness of George III''. The closing credits of the film include the comment that the illness suffered by King George has been attributed to porphyria and that it is hereditary. Among other descendants of George III theorised by the authors of ''Purple Secret'' to have suffered from porphyria (based upon analysis of their extensive and detailed medical correspondence) were his great-great-granddaughter [[Princess Charlotte of Prussia]] ([[William II, German Emperor|Emperor William II]]'s eldest sister) and her daughter [[Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen]]. They had more success in being able to uncover reliable evidence that George III's great-great-great-grandson [[Prince William of Gloucester]] was reliably diagnosed with variegate porphyria.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

It is believed that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] – [[George III|King George III's]] great-great-great-great-great-grandmother – also suffered from acute intermittent porphyria,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} although this is subject to much debate. It is assumed she inherited the disorder, if indeed she had it, from her father, [[James V of Scotland]]; both father and daughter endured well-documented attacks that could fall within the constellation of symptoms of porphyria.

[[Vlad the Impaler | Vlad III]] was also said to have suffered from acute porphyria, which may have started the notion that vampires were allergic to sunlight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Other commentators have suggested that [[Vincent van Gogh]] may have suffered from acute intermittent porphyria.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Loftus LS, Arnold WN |title=Vincent van Gogh's illness: acute intermittent porphyria? |journal=BMJ |volume=303 |issue=6817 |pages=1589–1591 |year=1991 |pmid=1773180 |doi=10.1136/bmj.303.6817.1589 |pmc=1676250}}</ref> It has also been speculated that [[Nebuchadnezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon]] suffered from some form of porphyria (cf. Daniel 4).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Beveridge A |title=The madness of politics |journal=[[J R Soc Med]] |volume=96 |issue=12 |pages=602–604 |year=2003 |pmid=14645615| doi = 10.1258/jrsm.96.12.602 |pmc=539664}}</ref> However, the symptoms of the various porphyrias are so extensive that a wide constellation of symptoms can be attributed to one or more of them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Paula Frías Allende, the daughter of the Chilean novelist [[Isabel Allende]], fell into a porphyria-induced coma in 1991,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Allende, Isabel |title=Paula |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=New York, NY |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-06-017253-3}}</ref> which inspired Isabel to write the biographical book ''[[Paula (novel)|Paula]]'', dedicated to her.
