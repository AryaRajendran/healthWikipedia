'''Deep vein thrombosis''', or '''deep venous thrombosis''', ('''DVT''') is the formation of a [[blood clot]] (thrombus) in a [[deep vein]],{{efn|Thrombosis associated with the abdominal organs ([[viscera]])—such as [[portal vein thrombosis]], [[renal vein thrombosis]], and [[Budd–Chiari syndrome]]—are separate diseases excluded from the scope of this definition.}} predominantly in the legs. Non-specific signs may include pain, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], redness, warmness, and engorged [[superficial veins]]. [[Pulmonary embolism]], a potentially life-threatening [[complication (medicine)|complication]], is caused by the detachment ([[embolization]]) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as [[venous thromboembolism]]. [[Post-thrombotic syndrome]], another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.

In 1856, German pathologist [[Rudolph Virchow]] postulated the interplay of three processes resulting in venous thrombosis, now known as [[Virchow's triad]]: a decreased blood flow rate ([[venous stasis]]), increased tendency to clot ([[hypercoagulability]]), and changes to the [[endothelium|blood vessel wall]]. DVT formation typically begins inside the valves of the [[calf]] veins, where the blood is relatively oxygen deprived, which activates certain [[biochemical pathway]]s. Several medical conditions increase the risk for DVT, including cancer, [[physical trauma|trauma]], and [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]. Other [[risk factor]]s include older age, surgery, immobilization (as with bed rest, [[orthopedic cast]]s, and sitting on long flights), [[combined oral contraceptives]], pregnancy, the [[puerperium|postnatal period]], and genetic factors such as a non-O [[blood type]].  The frequency of occurrence ([[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]) increases dramatically from childhood to old age; in adulthood, about 1 in 1000 adults develop DVT annually.

Individuals suspected of having DVT may be assessed using a [[clinical prediction rule]] such as the [[Deep_vein_thrombosis#Probability|Wells score]]. A [[D-dimer]] test may also be used to assist with excluding the diagnosis (because of its high [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]]) or to signal a need for further testing. Diagnosis is most commonly done with [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the suspected veins. [[Anticoagulation]] is the standard treatment; typical medications include a [[low-molecular-weight heparin]] and a [[vitamin K antagonist]]. Wearing [[graduated compression stocking]]s appears to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome. [[Prophylaxis|Prevention]] options for at-risk individuals include early and frequent walking, calf exercises, anticoagulants, aspirin, graduated compression stockings, and [[intermittent pneumatic compression]].

A severe and uncommon form of DVT, [[phlegmasia cerulea dolens]], may develop in association with a life-threatening illness. It is characterized by an acute and almost total venous occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the [[Iliac vein|iliac]] and [[femoral vein]]s. The leg is usually painful, [[Cyanosis|cyanosed]] (blue from lack of oxygen), and [[edema]]tous (filled with fluid), which may result in venous [[gangrene]].<ref name="ACS"/><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Images in clinical medicine: Phlegmasia cerulea dolens|author=Barham K, Shah T|year=2007|journal=N Engl J Med |volume=356|issue=3|pages=e3|pmid=17229945|doi=10.1056/NEJMicm054730|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm054730}}</ref>

Often, DVT begins in the valves of veins.<ref name="Saha"/> The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen concentrations in the blood ([[hypoxemia]]) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include [[hypoxia-inducible factor-1]] and [[early-growth-response protein 1]]. Hypoxemia also results in the production of [[reactive oxygen species]], which can activate these pathways, as well as [[nuclear factor-κB]], which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].<ref name="Whatis"/> Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as [[P-selectin]], prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled [[microvesicles]], which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.<ref name="Whatis"/>

==Diagnosis==

DVT diagnosis requires the use of [[Medical imaging|imaging]] devices such as [[Lower limbs venous ultrasonography|ultrasound]]. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a [[D-dimer]] test is useful.

===Probability<!--Wells score (disambiguation) and deep vein thrombosis links here-->===
[[File:Combinpedal.jpg|thumb|Swelling in the leg from fluid (edema) can result in "pitting" after pressure is applied. (This person did not have DVT.)]]

In those with suspected DVT, a clinical assessment of probability can be useful to determine which tests to perform.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 16S: 3.1.</ref> The most studied [[clinical prediction rule]] is the Wells score.<ref name="Diagnosis"/><!--p. e383S-->

'''Wells score or criteria''': (possible score −2 to 9)

#Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): +1 point
#Calf swelling ≥ 3&nbsp;cm compared to asymptomatic calf (measured 10&nbsp;cm below tibial tuberosity): +1 point
#Swollen unilateral superficial veins (non-varicose, in symptomatic leg): +1 point
#Unilateral pitting edema (in symptomatic leg): +1 point
#Previous documented DVT: +1 point
#Swelling of entire leg: +1 point
#Localized tenderness along the deep venous system: +1 point
#Paralysis, [[paresis]], or recent cast immobilization of lower extremities: +1 point

Those with Wells scores of two or more have a 28% chance of having DVT, those with a lower score have 6% odds. Alternatively, Wells scores can be categorized as high if greater than two, moderate if one or two, and low if less than one, with likelihoods of 53%, 17%, and 5% respectively.<ref name="Diagnosis"/><!--p. e384--><ref name="Hargett"/>

===D-dimer===
D-dimers are a [[fibrin degradation product]], and an elevated level can result from [[plasmin]] dissolving a clot—or other conditions.<ref name="Mayo">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/9290 |title=DDI/9290 clinical: D-dimer, plasma |publisher=Mayo Medical Laboratories |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons.<ref name="Diagnosis"/><!--p. e383S--><ref name="Adam">{{cite journal |author=Adam SS, Key NS, Greenberg CS |title=D-dimer antigen: Current concepts and future prospects |journal=Blood |volume=113 |issue=13 |pages=2878–87 |year=2009 |pmid=19008457 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-06-165845 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/113/13/2878.full.html}}</ref> When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 17S: 3.4.</ref> For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal.<ref name="Mayo"/> An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.<ref name="G16S3.2."/><ref name="G16S3.3"/>

For a suspected first leg DVT in a low-probability situation, the [[American College of Chest Physicians]] (ACCP) recommends testing either D-dimer levels with moderate or high sensitivity or compression ultrasound of the proximal veins. These options are suggested over whole-leg ultrasound, and D-dimer testing is the suggested preference overall.<ref name="G16S3.2."/> For a suspected first leg DVT in a moderate-probability scenario, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is suggested as a recommended option over ultrasound imaging, with both whole-leg and compression ultrasound possible.<ref name="G16S3.3">[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 16S: 3.3.</ref>

===Imaging===
Imaging tests of the veins are used in the diagnosis of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment.<ref name="Diagnosis"/><!--p. e384S--> [[Doppler ultrasound]],<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 19S: 5.3. & 6.1.</ref> CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.<ref name="Diagnosis"/><ref name="G16S3.2.">[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 16S: 3.2.</ref>

The [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for judging imaging methods is contrast [[venography]], which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations this test is rarely performed.<ref name="Diagnosis"/><!--p. e383S-->

[[File:Kompressionsstrümpfe.jpg|thumb|The ACCP suggested graduated compression stockings for at-risk travelers and some hospital patients.]]

===Hospital===

In 2011, the [[American College of Physicians]] (ACP) issued a clinical practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for their risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used.

===Home treatment, stockings, walking, and serial imaging===
The ACCP recommended initial home treatment instead of hospital treatment for those with acute leg DVT. This applies as long as individuals feel ready for it, and those with severe leg symptoms or [[comorbidities]] would not qualify. An appropriate home environment is expected: one that can provide a quick return to the hospital if necessary, support from family or friends, and phone access.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 21S: 2.7.</ref> In addition to anticoagulation, the ACCP suggested graduated compression stockings—which apply higher pressure (30–40&nbsp;mm Hg) at the ankles and a lower pressure around the knees<ref name="Kearon2"/><!--p.460S-->—for those with symptomatic DVT.<ref name="G23S">[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 23S: 4.1.</ref> Use should begin as soon as possible after anticoagulation.<ref name="Kearon2"/><!--p.460S--> Existing randomized controlled trials give moderate-quality evidence that these stockings reduce the risk of [[post-thrombotic syndrome]].<ref name="Kearon2"/><!--p.460S--><ref>{{cite journal |author=Musani MH, Matta F, Yaekoub AY, et al.|title=Venous compression for prevention of postthrombotic syndrome: A meta-analysis |journal=Am J Med |volume=123 |issue=8 |pages=735–40 |year=2010 |pmid=20670728 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.01.027 |url=}}</ref> An estimate on the [[number needed to treat]] suggests about four people need stockings to prevent one post-thrombotic syndrome case.<ref name="pmid17003920">{{cite journal |author=Kakkos S, Daskalopoulou S, Daskalopoulos M, et al. |title=Review on the value of graduated elastic compression stockings after deep vein thrombosis |journal=Thromb Haemost |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=441–5 |year=2006 |pmid=17003920 |doi=10.1160/TH06-05-0258}}</ref> Trials do not indicate a reduction in recurrent VTE.<ref name="Kearon2"/><!--p.460S-->  Use is suggested for two years, though inconvenience and discomfort can reduce [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]].<ref name="G23S"/> Walking is also suggested over bed rest for those without severe pain or edema.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 21S: 2.14.</ref>

Instead of anticoagulation, a follow-up imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one week post-diagnosis is an option for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation.<ref name="Kearon2"/><!--e434S--><ref name="G20S 2.3."/> This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns about the risk of bleeding are insignificant.<ref name="G20S 2.3.">[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 20S: 2.3.</ref> When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not [[cost effective]].<ref name="Scarvelis"/>

===IVC filters, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy===
[[File:Inferior vena cava filter.jpg|thumb|An IVC filter]]
[[Inferior vena cava filter]]s (IVC filters) are used on the presumption that they reduce PE, although their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established.<ref name="Young">{{cite journal| author=Young T, Tang H, Hughes R| title=Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | year= 2010 | issue= 2 | pages= CD006212 | pmid=20166079 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006212.pub4| editor1-last=Young| editor1-first=Tim }}</ref> In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios.<ref name="Young"/> The ACCP recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter is suggested.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 21S: 2.13.1.–3.</ref> While IVC filters are associated with a long-term risk of DVT,<ref name="Young"/> they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 21S: 2.13.</ref>

[[Thrombolysis]], which acts to break up clots, can be systemic or catheter-directed, but the ACCP suggested anticoagulation instead; however, patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 21S: 2.9 & 2.10.</ref> A mechanical thrombectomy device can remove venous clots, although the ACCP considers it an option only when the following conditions apply: "iliofemoral DVT, symptoms for < 7 days (criterion used in the single randomized trial), good functional status, life expectancy of ≥ 1 year, and both resources and expertise are available."<ref name="Kearon2">{{cite journal|author=Kearon C, Akl EA, Comerota AJ, et al. |title=Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: Antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines |journal=Chest |volume=141 |issue=suppl 2 |pages=e419S–e494S |year=2012 |pmid=22315268 |doi=10.1378/chest.11-2301 |pmc=3278049}}</ref><!--e442S--> Anticoagulation alone is suggested over thrombectomy.<ref>[[#CITEREFGuyatt2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 21S: 2.11.</ref>

==History==
[[File:Rudolf Virchow older portrait.jpg|thumb|Rudolf Virchow]]
The first documented DVT is thought to have occurred in the 13th century, in the leg of a 20-year-old male.<ref name="Lijfering"/> At some point, the increased incidence of DVT in women after childbirth was noticed, and in the late 1700s, a public health recommendation was issued to encourage women to breast feed as a means to prevent this phenomenon; the DVT was called "milk leg", as it was thought to result from milk building up in the leg.{{sfn|Rosendaal|2009|p=3}}

In 1856, German physician and pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] published what is referred to as Virchow's triad, the three major causes of thrombosis.<ref name="Lijfering"/>{{sfn|Rosendaal|2009|p=3}} The triad provides the theoretical framework for the current explanation of venous thrombosis,<ref name="Lijfering"/> although it was focused on the effect of a foreign body in the venous system and the conditions required for clot propagation.<ref name="Bagot2008">{{cite journal|author=Bagot CN, Arya R |title=Virchow and his triad: A question of attribution |journal=Br J Haematol |year=2008 |volume=143 |issue=2 |pages=180–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07323.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07323.x/full |pmid=18783400}}</ref>

Multiple pharmacological therapies for DVT were introduced in the 20th century: oral anticoagulants in the 1940s, [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] LDUH in 1962, and subcutaneous LMWH in 1982.{{sfn|Dalen|2003|p=2}} Diagnoses were commonly performed by [[impedance plethysmography]] in the 1970s and 1980s, but the use of Doppler ultrasound techniques, with their increased sensitivity and specificity, largely superseded this method.{{sfn|Dalen|2003|p=3}}
