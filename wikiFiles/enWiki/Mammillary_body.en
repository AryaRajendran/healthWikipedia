The '''mammillary bodies''' (mamillary bodies) are a pair of small round bodies, located on the undersurface of the [[brain]], that, as part of the [[diencephalon]] form part of the [[limbic system]].  They are located at the ends of the [[anterior]] arches of the [[fornix of brain|fornix]].  They consist of two groups of nuclei, the medial mammillary nuclei and the lateral mammillary nuclei.<ref>http://www.cf.ac.uk/psych/resources/vann2004.pdf Reference for the two groups of nuclei (not for the text before).</ref>

Neuroanatomists have often categorized the mammillary bodies as part of the [[hypothalamus]].<ref>M.B. Carpenter and J. Sutin: ''Human Neuroanatomy'' (8th edition) 1983</ref>  

==Connections==
They are connected to other parts of the brain (as shown in the schematic, below left), and act as a relay for impulses coming from the [[amygdala]]e and [[hippocampus|hippocampi]], via the [[mamillo-thalamic tract]] to the [[thalamus]].  

This circuit, from amygdalae to mammillary bodies, and then on to the thalamus, is part of the larger [[Papez circuit]].

==Function==
Mammillary bodies, and their projections to the anterior thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract, are important for  [[episodic memory|recollective memory]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://psych.cf.ac.uk/home2/vann/VannNeuro2010.pdf | title=Re-evaluating the role of the mammillary bodies in memory | author=Seralynne D. Vann | journal=Neuropsychologia | year=2010 | volume=48 | pages=2316–2327 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.019}}</ref>

They are believed to add the element of smell to memories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Pathology==
Damage to the mammillary bodies due to [[thiamine]] deficiency is implied in pathogenesis of [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]].  Symptoms include impaired [[memory]], also called [[anterograde amnesia]], suggesting that the mammillary bodies may be important for memory.  Lesions of the medial dorsal and anterior nuclei of the thalami and lesions of the mammillary bodies are commonly involved in [[Amnesia|amnesic]] syndromes in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Duprez T, Serieh B, Raftopoulos C |title=Absence of memory dysfunction after bilateral mammillary body and mammillothalamic tract electrode implantation: preliminary experience in three patients |journal=AJNR.
