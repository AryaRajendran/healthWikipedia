'''Robert Guthrie''', MD, Ph.D. (June 28, 1916 &mdash; June 23, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] [[microbiologist]], best known for developing the bacterial inhibition assay used to [[newborn screening|screen]] infants for [[phenylketonuria]] at birth, before the development of irreversible neurological damage.<ref name=bio>{{cite doi|10.1309/LMD48N6BNZSXIPVH}}</ref>  Guthrie also pioneered the collection of [[whole blood]] on specially designed filter paper, commonly known as "Guthrie cards" as a sample medium that could be easily collected, transported and tested.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=Robert Guthrie:  The PKU Story|publisher=Hope Publishing House|last=Koch|first=Jean|year=1997|isbn=0-932727-91-3|page=x}}</ref>  Although Guthrie is best known for developing the test for phenylketonuria, he worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the need to screen for treatable conditions and adapted his method to early screening tests for [[galactosemia]] and [[maple syrup urine disease]].

==Early life==
Guthrie received his doctorate from the [[University of Minnesota]],<ref name=obit>{{cite web|title=Dr. Robert Guthrie, Developer of PKU test|url= http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950628&slug=2128681 |accessdate=2012-07-03|date=1995-06-25|last=Bjorhus|first=Jennifer|work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> although his education took a circuitous route, as he eventually earned six degrees in six years, including both a [[medical doctorate]] and a [[doctor of philosophy]].<ref name=book4>{{cite book|title=Robert Guthrie:  The PKU Story|publisher=Hope Publishing House|last=Koch|first=Jean|year=1997|isbn=0-932727-91-3|page=10}}</ref>  While in school, Guthrie married Margaret, a fellow student, and they eventually had six children together.<ref name=obit />  His early research into bacterial inhibition assays came while he was employed by the Staten Island Public Health Hospital, testing [[antibiotic]] sensitivity.<ref name=book3>{{cite book|title=Robert Guthrie:  The PKU Story|publisher=Hope Publishing House|last=Koch|first=Jean|year=1997|isbn=0-932727-91-3|page=13}}</ref>

==Research interests==
Guthrie became interested in causes and prevention of mental retardation after his son, John, was born disabled in 1947.  Despite his work in the field, the cause of his son's disability was never diagnosed.<ref name=book2>{{cite book|title=Robert Guthrie:  The PKU Story|publisher=Hope Publishing House|last=Koch|first=Jean|year=1997|isbn=0-932727-91-3|page=2}}</ref>  In 1958, Guthrie's 15-month old niece was diagnosed with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), a condition in which the body cannot metabolize [[phenylalanine]].  Untreated PKU results in irreversible neurological damage.<ref name=bio />  After the discovery of PKU as a cause of mental retardation, [[Horst Bickel]] and colleagues discovered that it could be treated successfully with a diet low in phenylalanine.<ref name=book5>{{cite book|title=Robert Guthrie:  The PKU Story|publisher=Hope Publishing House|last=Koch|first=Jean|year=1997|isbn=0-932727-91-3|pages=21–24}}</ref>  The main drawback in successful treatment of PKU was the delay in identifying affected individuals.  The common test for PKU at the time was mixing [[urine]] with [[ferric chloride]].  The excess [[phenylpyruvic acid]] in the urine of an individual with PKU would produce a bright green colour when reacting with the ferric chloride.  Infants do not excrete high enough concentrations of this compound to give a positive test result, thus delaying their diagnosis, and allowing irreversible damage to take place.<ref name=bio />  Guthrie's disabled son had driven his interest in causes of [[mental retardation]], the diagnosis of his niece with PKU turned his attention to preventable causes.  Others working with children who had PKU asked Guthrie to focus on a test that would allow for earlier identification, before irreversible damage had taken place.<ref name=bio />

==The Guthrie test==
[[Image:Phenylketonuria testing.jpg|thumb|250px|Whole blood being collected on filter paper for [[newborn screening]].]] 
Guthrie developed a simple method to screen for elevated phenylalanine levels using a bacterial inhibition assay. He cultured ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' on [[agar]] in the presence of a phenylalanine [[antagonist]], inhibiting the growth.  When exposed to blood from patients affected with PKU, the high levels of phenylalanine overcame the inhibition, and bacterial growth was visible.<ref name=bio />  This assay was initially developed to allow monitoring of phenylalanine concentrations in known patients on dietary treatment using [[blood serum|serum]] spotted onto filter paper.  Guthrie recognized both the utility of this method as a screening test, and the need to eliminate serum as the sample type to minimize processing.  He tested the assay using whole blood collected on filter paper from a heel stick.<ref name=bio />  The collection of whole blood on special filter paper developed by Guthrie is still used in newborn screening programs around the world, allowing babies to be screened shortly after birth for a number of treatable conditions.<ref name=cdc>{{cite web|title=Protected From Birth:  Newborn Screening Saves Lives and Futures|url=http://www.cdcfoundation.org/blog-entry/protected-birth-newborn-screening-saves-lives-and-futures|date=2010-06-08|accessdate=2012-07-04|last=Heyns|first=Terri|publisher=The CDC Foundation}}</ref>

After establishing a test that could identify PKU in whole blood spots,<ref name=pkupaper>{{cite pmid|14063511}}</ref> Guthrie set out to test his method, starting in an institution in New York.  Here, his test correctly identified all patients known to have PKU and also four who had previously been undiagnosed.<ref name=bio />  In 1961, Guthrie and his lab started screening infants for PKU, a project that quickly expanded.  In two years, they had tested 400,000 American newborns, and diagnosed 39 with PKU.  This early diagnosis allowed for early treatment and avoidance of the most severe consequences of the disease.<ref name=bio />  Throughout the 1960s, PKU testing expanded in the United States and around the world, eventually becoming required by law in many jurisdictions.<ref name=bio />  With the success of PKU testing, Guthrie and his colleagues focused on screening tests for other diseases that can affect newborns.  They developed bacterial inhibition assays for [[galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency|galactosemia]] and [[maple syrup urine disease]] that could be run using the same sample collection as the PKU test.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=Robert Guthrie:  The PKU Story|publisher=Hope Publishing House|last=Koch|first=Jean|year=1997|isbn=0-932727-91-3|pages=47–48}}</ref>
