'''X-linked dominant inheritance''', sometimes referred to as '''X-linked dominance''', is a mode of [[genetics|genetic inheritance]] by which a [[dominant gene]] is carried on the [[X chromosome]]. As an inheritance pattern, it is less common than the [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked recessive]] type. In medicine, X-linked dominant inheritance indicates that a gene responsible for a [[genetic disorder]] is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the allele is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.

X-linked dominant traits do not necessarily affect males more than females (unlike [[X-linked recessive]] traits). The exact pattern of inheritance varies, depending on whether the father or the mother has the trait of interest. All daughters of an affected father will also be affected but none of his sons will be affected (unless the mother is also affected). In addition, the mother of an affected son is  also affected (but not necessarily the other way round).

Some scholars have suggested discontinuing the terms dominant and recessive when referring to X-linked inheritance due to the multiple mechanisms that can result in the expression of X-linked traits in females, which include cell autonomous expression, skewed X-inactivation, clonal expansion, and somatic mosaicism.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15316978}}</ref>

==Genetics==
As the X chromosome is one of the [[sex chromosome]]s (the other being the [[Y chromosome]]), X-linked
inheritance is determined by the [[gender]] of the parent carrying a specific gene and can often seem complex. This is due to the fact that, typically, [[female]]s have two copies of the X-chromosome, while [[male]]s have only one copy. The difference between [[Dominance (genetics)#Dominant trait|dominant]] and [[Dominance (genetics)#Recessive|recessive]] inheritance patterns also plays a role in determining the chances of a child inheriting an X-linked disorder from their parentage. 

Males are normally [[Zygosity#Hemizygous|hemizygous]] for the X chromosome, having only one copy. As a result, X-linked dominant disorders usually show higher [[expressivity]] in males than females.<ref name=hex91>{{cite pmid|2018074}}</ref>

In X-linked dominant inheritance, when the mother alone is the [[genetic carrier|carrier]] of a mutated, or defective gene associated with a disease or disorder; she herself will have the disorder. Her children will inherit the disorder as follows:

*Of her daughters and sons: 50% will have the disorder, 50% will be completely unaffected. Children of both genders have an even chance of receiving either of their mother's two X chromosomes, one of which contains the defective gene in question.

When the father alone is the carrier of a defective gene associated with a disease or disorder, he too will have the disorder. His children will inherit the disorder as follows: 

*Of his daughters: 100% will have the disorder, since all of his daughters will receive one copy of his single X chromosome.
*Of his sons: none will have the disorder; sons do not receive an X chromosome from their father.

If both parents were carriers of a defective gene associated with a disease or disorder, they would both have the disorder. Their children would inherit the disorder as follows: 

*Of their daughters: 100% will have the disorder, since all of the daughters will receive a copy of their father's X chromosome.
*Of the sons: 50% will have the disorder, 50% will be completely unaffected. Sons have an equal chance of receiving either of their mother's X chromosomes.

In such a case, where both parents carry and thus are affected by an X-linked dominant disorder, the chance of a daughter receiving two copies of the X chromosome with the defective gene is 50%, since daughters receive one copy of the X chromosome from both parents. Were this to occur with an X-linked dominant disorder, that daughter would likely experience a more severe form.

Some X-linked dominant conditions such as [[Aicardi Syndrome]] are fatal to boys, therefore only girls with these conditions survive. Similarly, individuals with [[Klinefelter's Syndrome]] are referred to as "47,XXY Males".
