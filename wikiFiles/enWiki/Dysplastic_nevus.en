A '''dysplastic nevus''' (also known as a: Atypical mole, Atypical nevus, B-K mole, Clark's nevus, Dysplastic melanocytic nevus, Nevus with architectural disorder<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=1732 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>) is an atypical [[melanocytic nevus]];<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000072232|dysplastic nevus}}</ref> a mole whose appearance is different from that of common moles. Dysplastic nevi are generally larger than ordinary moles and have irregular and indistinct borders. Their color frequently is not uniform and ranges from pink to dark brown; they usually are flat, but parts may be raised above the skin surface. Dysplastic nevi can be found anywhere, but are most common on the [[Torso|trunk]] in men, and on the [[Calf (anatomy)|calves]] in women. In 1992, the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] recommended that the term "dysplastic nevus" be avoided in favor of the term "atypical mole."<ref name=NIHConsensus1992>{{cite journal |author= ,|title=NIH Consensus conference.

==Cancer==
According to the [[National Cancer Institute]], researchers have shown that atypical moles are more likely than ordinary moles to develop into a type of [[skin cancer]] called [[melanoma]]. It is worth noting that the vast majority of atypical moles will never become malignant.  However, numerous studies indicate that about half of melanomas arise from atypical moles.  Evidence supporting this connection arises from clinical photodocumentation of evolving lesions, patient self-reports of changing lesions, pathology studies showing dysplastic nevi in histologic contiguity with melanoma, and epidemiology studies indicating that about half of individuals affected by melanoma also have atypical moles.  Epidemiology studies have also shown that individuals with multiple dysplastic nevi are at much higher risk for developing melanomas.  Because of this, moles should be checked regularly by a doctor or nurse specialist, especially if they look complex; grow larger; or change in color, or shape; or if ''any'' changes occur, such as itching, flaking or oozing.

==Precaution for individuals with dysplastic nevi==

Although there are limited data to support its efficacy, skin self-examination is frequently recommended for preventing melanoma (by identifying atypical moles that can be removed) or for early detection of existing tumors. Examination by a dermatologist has been shown to be beneficial for early melanoma detection.  Some dermatologists recommend that an individual with either histologic diagnosis of dysplastic nevus, or clinically apparent atypical moles should be examined by an experienced dermatologist with [[dermatoscopy]] once a year (or more frequently).

The acronym ABCDE has been useful for helping health care providers and laypersons remember the key characteristics of a melanoma (see "ABCDE" mnemonic below). Changes (in shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) should be brought to the attention of a dermatologist .<ref>{{cite journal | author = Friedman R, Rigel D, Kopf A | title = Early detection of malignant melanoma: the role of physician examination and self-examination of the skin | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 130–51 | year = 1985| pmid = 3921200 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.35.3.130}}</ref>

A popular method for remembering the signs and symptoms of melanoma is the mnemonic "ABCDE":
* '''A'''symmetrical skin lesion.
* '''B'''order of the lesion is irregular.
* '''C'''olor: melanomas usually have multiple colors.
* '''D'''iameter: moles greater than 6&nbsp;mm are more likely to be melanomas than smaller moles.
* '''E'''volution: The evolution (i.e. change) of a mole or lesion may be a hint that the lesion is becoming malignant.

The '''E''' is sometimes omitted, as in the [[ABCD guideline]].  A weakness in this system is the '''D'''.  Many melanomas present themselves as lesions smaller than 6&nbsp;mm in diameter.  An astute physician will examine all abnormal moles, including ones less than 6&nbsp;mm in diameter.  Unfortunately for the average person, many [[seborrheic keratosis]], some lentigo senilis, and even warts may have ABCD characteristics, and cannot be distinguished from a melanoma without a trained eye or [[dermatoscopy]].

A recent and novel method of melanoma detection is the '''"Ugly Duckling Sign"''' <ref>http://www.skincancer.org/melanoma/Warning-Signs.html</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Mascaro JM Jr, Mascaro JM. The dermatologist's position concerning nevi: a vision ranging from 'the ugly duckling' to 'little red riding hood'. Arch Dermatol 1998; 134:1484–5.</ref>  It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma.  Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person's skin lesion is made.  Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an "Ugly Duckling", and a dermatologist exam is required.  The '''"Little Red Riding Hood"''' sign<ref name="ReferenceA"/> suggests that individuals with fair skin and light colored hair might prove more challenging.  These fair skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas which will not present with easy to observe color changes and variation in colors.  The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a dermatoscope ([[dermatoscopy]]) very difficult. A dermatoscope must be used to detect "ugly ducklings" among those with light skin or blonde/red hair.  

People with a personal or family history of skin cancer or of [[dysplastic nevus syndrome]] (multiple atypical moles) should see a dermatologist at least once a year to be sure they are not developing melanoma.

==Biopsy==
When an atypical mole has been identified, a [[skin biopsy]] takes place in order to best diagnose it.  Local anesthetic is used to numb the area, then the mole is biopsied.  The biopsy material is then sent to a [[laboratory]] to be evaluated by a [[pathologist]].  A [[skin biopsy]] can be a punch, shave, or complete excision.  The complete excision is the preferred method, but a punch biopsy can suffice if the patient has cosmetic concerns (i.e. the patient does not want a scar) and the lesion is small.  A scoop or deep shave biopsy is often advocated, but should be avoided due to risk of a [[recurrent nevus]], which can complicate future diagnosis of a melanoma, and the possibility that resulting scar tissue can obscure tumor depth if a melanoma is found to be present and re-excised.

Most dermatologists and dermatopathologists use a system devised by the [[NIH]] for classifying melanocytic lesions.  In this classification, a nevus can be defined as benign, having atypia, or being a melanoma.  A benign nevus is read as (or understood as) having no cytologic or architectural atypia.  An atypical mole is read as having architectural atypia, and having (mild, moderate, or severe) cytologic (melanocytic) atypia.<ref>http://www.labpath.com/new1.html</ref>  Usually, cytologic atypia is of more important clinical concern than architectural atypia.  Usually, moderate to severe cytologic atypia will require further excision to make sure that the surgical margin is completely clear of the lesion.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The most important aspect of the biopsy report is that the pathologist indicates if the margin is clear (negative or free of melanocytic nevus), or if further tissue (a second surgery) is required.  If this is not mentioned, usually a dermatologist or clinician will require further surgery if moderate to severe cytologic atypia is present - and if residual nevus is present at the surgical margin.

==Dysplastic nevus syndrome==
{{main|Dysplastic nevus syndrome}}
"Dysplastic nevus syndrome" refers to individuals who have high numbers of benign moles and also have dysplastic nevi. A small percent of these individuals are members of melanoma kindreds.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000104109|dysplastic nevus syndrome}}</ref> Inherited dysplastic nevus syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary condition.  Dysplastic nevi are more likely to undergo malignant transformation when they occur among members of melanoma families.  At least one study indicates a cumulative lifetime risk of nearly 100% in individuals who have dysplastic nevi and are members of melanoma kindreds. (ref needed)
Roughly half of melanomas arise "de novo" on clear skin [[tumor|growth]], whereas the other half arise within atypical moles. Those with dysplastic nevi have an elevated risk of melanoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pope DJ, Sorahan T, Marsden JR, Ball PM, Grimley RP, Peck IM |title=Benign pigmented nevi in children. Prevalence and associated factors: the West Midlands, United Kingdom Mole Study |journal=Arch Dermatol. |volume=128 |issue=9 |pages=1201–6 |year=1992 |month=Sep |pmid=1519934 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.128.9.1201|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldgar DE, Cannon-Albright LA, Meyer LJ, Piepkorn MW, Zone JJ, Skolnick MH |title=Inheritance of nevus number and size in melanoma and dysplastic nevus syndrome kindreds |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst. |volume=83 |issue=23 |pages=1726–33 |year=1991 |month=Dec |pmid=1770551 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/83.23.1726|url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1770551}}</ref> Such persons need to be checked regularly for any changes in their moles and to note any new ones. In 40-50% of cases, the disorder has been linked with germline mutations in the [[CDKN2A]] gene, which codes for [[p16]] (a regulator of cell division).
