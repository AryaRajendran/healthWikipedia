{{other uses|Reflex (disambiguation)}}

A '''reflex action''', differently known as a '''reflex''', is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]].<ref>Purves (2004). ''Neuroscience: Third Edition''. Massachusetts, Sinauer Associates, Inc.</ref>  Scientific use of the term "reflex" refers to a behavior that is mediated via the [[reflex arc]]; this does not apply to casual uses of the term 'reflex'.

==Human reflexes==
===Stretch reflexes===
The [[stretch reflex]]es (often called ''deep tendon reflexes'', though not to be confused with [[Golgi tendon reflex]]es) provide information on the integrity of the [[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]. Generally, decreased reflexes indicate a peripheral problem, and lively or exaggerated reflexes a central one.

* [[Jaw jerk reflex]] (CN V)
* [[Biceps reflex]] ([[cervical spinal nerve 5|C5]], [[cervical spinal nerve 6|C6]])
* [[Brachioradialis reflex]] (C5, C6, [[cervical spinal nerve 7|C7]])
* [[Extensor digitorum reflex]] (C6, C7)
* [[Triceps reflex]] (C6, C7, [[cervical spinal nerve 8|C8]])
* [[Patellar reflex]] or knee-jerk reflex [[lumbar spinal nerves 2, 3, 4|L2, L3, L4]])
* [[Ankle jerk reflex]] (Achilles reflex) ([[sacral spinal nerve 1|S1]], [[sacral spinal nerve 2|S2]])

While the reflexes above are stimulated mechanically, the term [[H-reflex]] refers to the analogous reflex stimulated electrically, and [[Tonic vibration reflex]] for those stimulated to vibration.

===Reflexes usually only observed in human infants===
{{main|Primitive reflexes}}
[[Image:Greifreflex.JPG|thumb|Grasp reflex]]<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Flexor Reflex.jpg|thumb|spinal cord]] -->
[[Newborn babies]] have a number of other reflexes which are not seen in adults, referred to as '''primitive reflexes'''.<ref>[http://www.fpnotebook.com/Neuro/Exam/NrlgcExm.htm Neurologic Exam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> These automatic reactions to stimuli enable infants to respond to the environment before any learning has taken place. They include:
* [[Asymmetrical tonic neck reflex]] (ATNR)
* Hand-to-mouth reflex{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
* [[Moro reflex]], also known as the startle reflex
* [[Primitive reflexes#Palmar grasp reflex|Palmar grasp reflex]]
* [[Primitive reflexes#Rooting reflex|Rooting reflex]]
* [[Primitive reflexes#Sucking reflex|Sucking reflex]]
* Symmetrical tonic neck reflex (STNR)
* [[Tonic labyrinthine reflex]] (TLR)

===Other reflexes===
Other reflexes found in the central nervous system include:
* Abdominal reflexes (T6-L1)
**[[Gastrocolic reflex]]
* [[Anal wink|Anocutaneous reflex]] (S2-S4)
* [[Cremasteric reflex]] (L1-L2)
* [[Mammalian diving reflex]]
* [[Muscular defense]]
* [[Scratch reflex]]
* [[Startle reflex]]
* [[Withdrawal reflex]]
**[[Crossed extensor reflex]]
Many of these reflexes are quite complex requiring a number of synapses in a number of different nuclei in the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] (e.g., the [[escape reflex]]).  Others of these involve just a couple of synapses to function (e.g., the [[withdrawal reflex]]).
Processes such as [[breath]]ing, [[digestion]], and the maintenance of the [[Heart rate|heartbeat]] can also be regarded as reflex actions, according to some definitions of the term.

===Grading===
In [[medicine]], reflexes are often used to assess the health of the [[nervous system]].  [[physician|Doctors]] will typically grade the activity of a reflex on a scale from 0 to 4.<ref>[http://medinfo.ufl.edu/year1/bcs/clist/neuro.html University of Florida > Neurologic Examination] Retrieved on May 9, 2009</ref>  While 2+ is considered normal, some healthy individuals are hypo-reflexive and register all reflexes at 1+, while others are hyper-reflexive and register all reflexes at 3+.

{|class="wikitable"
|Grade || Description
|-
| 0 || Absent
|-
| 1+ or + || Diminished
|-
| 2+ or ++ || "Normal"
|-
| 3+ or +++ || Hyperactive without [[clonus]]
|-
| 4+ or ++++ || Hyperactive with clonus
