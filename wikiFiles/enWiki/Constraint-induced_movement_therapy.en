'''Constraint-induced movement therapy''' (CI or CIMT) is a form of rehabilitation therapy that improves upper extremity function in [[stroke]] and other [[central nervous system]] damage victims by increasing the use of their affected upper limb.<ref name=ASA>[http://www.strokeassociation.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3029931 "Constraint-induced movement therapy"], American Stroke Association</ref>

==Types of Constraint==

The focus of CIMT is to combine restraint of the unaffected limb and intensive use of the affected limb. Types of restraints include a sling or [[Bandage|triangular bandage]], a splint, a sling combined with a resting hand splint, a half glove, and a mitt.<ref name="Charles & Gordon.

Second, the other arm or hand needs to be constrained at least 90 percent of waking hours.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Susan B. |title=Physical Therapy |edition=5th |year=2007 |publisher=F.A.

==Mechanism of Change==
CIMT was developed by Dr. [[Edward Taub]] of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]. Taub argues that, after a stroke, the patient stops using the affected limb because they are discouraged by the difficulty.<ref name="DOIs" />  As a result, a process that Taub calls "[[learned non-use]]" sets in, furthering the deterioration. Learned non-use is a type of negative feedback. Individuals are unable to move their affected limb or the movements are inefficient and clumsy and in response to this a suppression of movement occurs. It is this process that CIMT seeks to reverse.The American Stroke Association has written that Taub's therapy is "at the forefront of a revolution" in what is regarded possible in terms of recovery for stroke survivors.<ref name=ASA/>

As a result of the patient engaging in repetitive exercises with the affected limb, the brain grows [[Neuroplasticity|new neural pathways]]. This change in the brain is referred to as cortical reorganization or [[neuroplasticity]]. One study by Deluca et al. showed that using [[Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation]] (TMS) that the excitable cortex of the affected cortex in adults patients with HCP doubled in size after 12 days of therapy.<ref name="Deluca et al. (2006)" /> Recently, the possible benefits of cortical reorganization has led to studies of CIMT on children because neuroplasticity is even greater among children than adults.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1310/tsr1605-339 |title=Pediatric Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy: A Promising Intervention for Childhood Hemiparesis |year=2009 |last1=Brady |first1=Kathleen D. |last2=Schultz |first2=Scott |last3=Trovato |first3=Melissa K. |last4=Garcia |first4=Teressa |last5=Pidcock |first5=Frank S. |journal=Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=339–45 |pmid=19903652}}</ref> Particular interest is growing in CIMT for children who have [[cerebral palsy]] where one arm is more affected than the other.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2522/ptj.20080111 |title=Bound for Success: A Systematic Review of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy in Children with Cerebral Palsy Supports Improved Arm and Hand Use |year=2009 |last1=Huang |first1=H.-h. |last2=Fetters |first2=L. |last3=Hale |first3=J. |last4=McBride |first4=A. |journal=Physical Therapy |volume=89 |issue=11 |pages=1126–41 |pmid=19729391}}</ref>

==Application of CIMT==

CIMT may be applicable to up to 75 percent of [[stroke]] patients, although the amount of improvement produced by CIMT appears to diminish as the initial motor ability of the patient decreases.<ref name=Taub/>  CIMT has been shown to be an effective means of stroke rehabilitation regardless of the level of initial motor ability, amount of [[chronicity]], amount of prior therapy, side of [[hemiparesis]], or [[infarct]] location.<ref name="Doistr">{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.STR.30.3.586 |title=Effects of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy on Patients with Chronic Motor Deficits After Stroke : A Replication |year=1999 |last1=Miltner |first1=W.

Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) coupled with intensive and varied exercise training has proven to be effective in reducing [[spasticity]] and increasing function of the [[hemiplegic]] upper extremity in [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] stroke patients.<ref name=Siebers>{{cite journal |pmid=21886380 |year=2010 |last1=Siebers |first1=A |last2=Oberg |first2=U |last3=Skargren |first3=E |title=The effect of modified constraint-induced movement therapy on spasticity and motor function of the affected arm in patients with chronic stroke |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=388–96 |doi=10.3138/physio.62.4.388 |pmc=2958081 |journal=Physiotherapy Canada. Physiotherapie Canada}}</ref> Siebers, Oberg and Skargren conducted a study in 2010 involving patients between 6 months to 10 years post stroke.  The unaffected upper limb of each subject was constrained using a restricting position belt for 90% of waking hours, 7 days a week, for 2 weeks and they were each assigned individualized, upper extremity exercise programs by a physiotherapist and occupational therapist to be completed 5 days a week in an outpatient rehabilitation clinic.  Reduced spasticity and improved function were measured following the 2-week treatment block and improvements persisted 6 months later.<ref name=Siebers />  Therefore, chronic hemiplegia can significantly benefit from CIMT with reductions in disuse complications, spasticity and improved function with increased use of the hemiplegic limb in activities of daily life.<ref name=Siebers />

The effects of constraint-induced movement therapy have been found to improve movements that not only remain stable for months after the completion of therapy, but translate well to improvements of everyday functional task.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.STR.30.3.586 | pmid=10066856 | volume=30 | issue=3 | title=Effects of constraint-induced movement therapy on patients with chronic motor deficits after stroke: a replication | year=1999 | month=March | author=Miltner WH, Bauder H, Sommer M, Dettmers C, Taub E | journal=Stroke | pages=586–92}}</ref> 
This can be done by including the “transfer package” of CIMT during treatment, in which the [[physical therapy|physiotherapist]] applies various strategies to help the patient adhere to the requirements of CIMT outside the clinical setting.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal |pmid=17039224 |year=2006 |last1=Morris |first1=DM |last2=Taub |first2=E |last3=Mark |first3=VW |title=Constraint-induced movement therapy: Characterizing the intervention protocol |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=257–68 |journal=Europa medicophysica}}</ref> These strategies may include: 1. '''Monitoring''', which requires patients to document their performance of target behaviours; 2. '''Problem solving''', in which patients create solutions and identify outcomes to potential obstacles; and 3. '''Behavioural contracting''', which involves getting patients to identify the components and methods of carrying out normal behaviors.<ref name= Morris />  Gauthier and colleagues demonstrated the importance of the “transfer package” by comparing outcome measure scores of post-[[stroke]] patients who participated in CIMT with and without the “transfer package”.<ref name= Gauthier2>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.502229 |title=Remodeling the Brain: Plastic Structural Brain Changes Produced by Different Motor Therapies After Stroke |year=2008 |last1=Gauthier |first1=L.

==Limitations to Implementation==
Presently, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has not been incorporated as part of standard practice for the rehabilitation of the [[hemiplegic]] upper extremity.<ref name=Viana>{{cite journal |doi=10.1310/tsr1902-104 |title=Barriers to the Implementation of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy into Practice |year=2012 |last1=Teasell |first1=Robert |last2=Viana |first2=Ricardo |journal=Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=104–14 |pmid=22436358}}</ref> Concerns have been raised over the generalizability of the results obtained from research, as selection criteria for CIMT research has excluded patients with a moderate or more severe stroke, due to balance problems, serious cognitive deficits, and [[global aphasia]], which may reduce understanding of safety instructions and interfere with a patient’s ability to communicate difficulties.<ref name=Sterr>{{cite journal |pmid=16917157 |year=2006 |last1=Sterr |first1=Annette |last2=Saunders |first2=Amy |title=CI therapy distribution: Theory, evidence and practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=97–105 |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |url=http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=1053-8135&volume=21&issue=2&spage=97}}</ref> 

The cost of resources needed to conduct CIMT treatment protocol are high. Costs are generated due to the intensity of therapy required for CIMT, as participants typically receive up to 6 hours of one-on-one therapy at least 5 days per week for 2 weeks.<ref name=Sterr/> CIMT can be prohibitively expensive for patients paying out-of-pocket or for publicly funded health care systems attempting to make this program available to all eligible stroke survivors.<ref name=Viana/> 

Therapist apprehension directed at safety issues with constraint use, lack of facilities, the cost of providing one-on-one therapy sessions, and the opportunity costs associated with the therapist’s inability to see and treat other patients during that time has contributed to the resistance of adopting the CIMT protocol.<ref name=Viana/><ref name=Sterr/> 

The patient’s ability to tolerate the intensity and duration of the therapy sessions is a limiting factor to protocol adoption. Stroke patients have commonly expressed the length of time wearing the constraint and time consuming hours of therapy as reasons they wish not to participate.<ref name=Sterr/>

While the CIMT protocol results in improved function in its target population, it is unknown whether the combination of constraint and therapy is necessary to achieve the outcome seen or whether the benefit is due to exposure to high-intensity, task-specific activities focused on the use of the more affected limb.<ref name=Viana/><ref name=Sterr/>
