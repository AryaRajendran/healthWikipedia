Over [[millennia]], polio survived quietly as an [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] pathogen until the 1880s when major epidemics began to occur in Europe;<ref name=Trevelyan_2005/> soon after, widespread epidemics appeared in the United States. By 1910, frequent epidemics became regular events throughout the developed world, primarily in cities during the summer months. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio would paralyze or kill over half a million people worldwide every year.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Polio | publisher = Canadian International Immunization Initiative | url = http://www.immunize.cpha.ca/english/consumer/consrese/pdf/Polio.pdf | page = 3 | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref>

The fear and the collective response to these epidemics would give rise to extraordinary public reaction and mobilization; spurring the development of new methods to prevent and treat the disease, and revolutionizing medical [[philanthropy]]. Although the development of two [[polio vaccines]] has [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicated poliomyelitis]] in all but four countries, the legacy of poliomyelitis remains, in the development of modern [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation therapy]], and in the rise of [[disability rights movement]]s worldwide.

==Epidemics==
Major polio [[epidemic]]s were unknown before the 20th century; localized paralytic polio epidemics began to appear in Europe and the United States around 1900.<ref name = Trevelyan_2005 /> The first report of multiple polio cases was published in 1843 and described an 1841 outbreak in [[Louisiana]]. A fifty-year gap occurs before the next U.S. report—a cluster of 26 cases in [[Boston]] in 1893.<ref name = Trevelyan_2005 /> The first recognized U.S. polio epidemic occurred the following year in [[Vermont]] with 132 total cases (18 deaths), including several cases in adults.<ref name=Sass_1996/> Numerous epidemics of varying magnitude began to appear throughout the country; by 1907 approximately 2,500 cases of poliomyelitis were reported in New York City.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sachs B (Chairman, New York Neurological Society) | title = Epidemic poliomyelitis; report on the New York epidemic of 1907 by the Collective investigation committee | year = 1910 | publisher = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease}}</ref>

On Saturday, June 17, 1916 an official announcement of the existence of an epidemic polio infection was made in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

==Historical treatments==
In the early 20th century—in the absence of proven treatments—a number of odd and potentially dangerous polio treatments were suggested. In [[John Haven Emerson]]'s ''A Monograph on the Epidemic of Poliomyelitis (Infantile Paralysis) in New York City in 1916''<ref>{{cite book |author=Emerson H |title=A monograph on the epidemic of poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-405-09817-0 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> one suggested remedy reads:

Following the 1916 epidemics and having experienced little success in treating polio patients, researchers set out to find new and better treatments for the disease. Between 1917 and the early 1950s several therapies were explored in an effort to prevent deformities including [[hydrotherapy]] and  [[electrotherapy]]. In 1935 Claus Jungeblut reported that [[vitamin C]] treatment enhanced resistance to poliomyelitis in monkeys.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Jungeblut | first=Claus Washington | title=INACTIVATION OF POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS IN VITRO BY CRYSTALLINE VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID) | journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine | url= http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/reprint/62/4/517.pdf| date=October 1935 | volume=62 | pages=517–521 | doi=10.1084/jem.62.4.517 | pmid=19870431 | issue=4 | pmc=2133291 }}</ref>

===Kenny regimen===
Early management practices for paralyzed muscles emphasized the need to rest the affected muscles and suggested that the application of [[splint (medicine)|splint]]s would prevent tightening of muscle, tendons, [[ligament]]s, or skin that would prevent normal movement. Many paralyzed polio patients lay in plaster body casts for months at a time. This prolonged casting often resulted in [[atrophy]] of both affected and unaffected muscles.<ref name= Daniel/>

In 1940, Sister [[Elizabeth Kenny]], an [[Australian bush]] nurse, arrived in North America and challenged this approach to treatment. In treating polio cases in rural Australia between 1928 and 1940, Kenny had developed a form of [[physical therapy]] that - instead of immobilizing afflicted limbs - aimed to relieve pain and spasms in polio patients through the use of hot, moist packs to relieve muscle spasm, and the advocated early activity and exercise to maximize the strength of unaffected muscle fibers and promote the neuroplastic recruitment of remaining nerve cells that had not been killed by the virus.<ref name= Oppewal/> Sister Kenny later settled in [[Minnesota]] where she established the [[Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute]], beginning a world-wide crusade to advocate her system of treatment. Slowly, Kenny's ideas won acceptance, and by the mid-20th century had become the hallmark for the treatment of paralytic polio.<ref name= Late/> In combination with [[antispasmodic]] medications to reduce muscular contractions, Kenny's therapy is still used in the treatment of paralytic poliomyelitis.

==Vaccine development==
{{main|Polio vaccine}}
[[File:Polio immunization days PHIL 2445.png|thumb|250px|left|People in [[Columbus, Georgia]] awaiting polio [[vaccination]] during the early days of the National Polio Immunization Program.]]
In 1935 Maurice Brodie, a research assistant at [[New York University]], attempted to produce a polio vaccine, procured from virus in ground up [[monkey]] spinal cords, and killed by [[formaldehyde]]. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself and several of his assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children, many developed allergic reactions, but none of the children developed an immunity to polio.<ref name = Pearce>{{cite journal |author=Pearce J |title=Salk and Sabin: poliomyelitis immunisation |url= http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/75/11/1552 |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=11 |page=1552 |year=2004 |pmid=15489385 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.028530 |pmc=1738787}}</ref> During the late 1940s and early 1950s, a research group, headed by [[John Enders]] at the Boston Children's Hospital, successfully cultivated the [[poliovirus]] in human tissue. This significant breakthrough ultimately allowed for the development of the polio vaccines. Enders and his colleagues, [[Thomas H. Weller]] and [[Frederick C. Robbins]], were recognized for their labors with the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1954.<ref name=Nobel_1954>{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1954 | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1954/ | accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>

Two vaccines are used throughout the world to combat [[polio]].  The first was developed by [[Jonas Salk]], first tested in 1952, and announced to the world by Salk on April 12, 1955.<ref name= Spice />  The Salk vaccine, or ''inactivated poliovirus vaccine'' (IPV), consists of an injected dose of killed [[poliovirus]]. In 1954, the vaccine was tested for its ability to prevent polio; the field trials involving the Salk vaccine would grow to be the largest medical experiment in history. Immediately following licensing, [[vaccination]] campaigns were launched, by 1957, following mass immunizations promoted by the [[March of Dimes]] the annual number of polio cases in the United States would be dramatically reduced, from a peak of nearly 58,000 cases, to just 5,600 cases.<ref name=Sass_1996/>

Eight years after Salk's success, [[Albert Sabin]] developed an ''oral polio vaccine'' (OPV) using live but weakened (''[[wiktionary:Attenuate|attenuated]]'') virus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sabin A, Ramos-Alvarez M, Alvarez-Amezquita J, ''et al.'' |title=Live, orally given poliovirus vaccine.

Following the development of oral polio vaccine, a second wave of mass immunizations would lead to a further decline in the number of cases: by 1961, only 161 cases were recorded in the United States.<ref name= Hinman>{{cite journal |author=Hinman A |title=Landmark perspective: Mass vaccination against polio |journal=JAMA |volume=251 |issue=22 |pages=2994–6 |year=1984 |pmid=6371280 |doi=10.1001/jama.251.22.2994}}</ref> The last cases of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] transmission of poliovirus in the United States were in 1979, when an outbreak occurred among the [[Amish]] in several [[Midwest]]ern states.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Follow-up on poliomyelitis--United States, Canada, Netherlands. 1979 |url= http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050435.htm| journal=MMWR Morb.

== Legacy ==

Early in the 20th century polio would become the world's most feared disease. The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, [[Affluence in the United States|affluent]] individuals, required long [[quarantine]] periods during which parents were separated from children: it was impossible to tell who would get the disease and who would be spared.<ref name=Sass_1996/> The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of [[wheelchair]]s, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only the lives of those who survived it, but also effected profound cultural changes: the emergence of [[grassroots]] fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical [[philanthropy]], the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.

In addition, the occurrence of polio epidemics led to a number of public health innovations.  One of the most widespread was the proliferation of "no spitting" ordinances in the United States and elsewhere.<ref>See David M. Oshinsky, ''Polio: an American Story''.

===Philanthropy===

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:March of dimes.jpg|thumb|March of Dimes poster circa late 1950s]] -->

In 1921 [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became totally and permanently [[paralyzed]] from the waist down. Although [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|the paralysis]] (whether from poliomyelitis, as diagnosed at the time, or from [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]]) had no cure at the time, Roosevelt, who had planned a life in [[politics]], refused to accept the limitations of his disease. He tried a wide range of therapies, including [[hydrotherapy]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]] (see below).  In 1938 Roosevelt helped to found the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (now known as the [[March of Dimes]]), that raised money for the [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] of victims of paralytic polio, and was instrumental in funding the development of [[polio vaccines]]. The March of Dimes changed the way it approached fund-raising. Rather than soliciting large contributions from a few wealthy individuals, the March of Dimes sought small donations from millions of individuals. Its hugely successful fund-raising campaigns collected hundreds of millions of dollars - more than all of the U.S. [[charities]] at the time combined (with the exception of the [[Red Cross]]).<ref name= Oshinsky>{{cite book |author=Oshinsky DM|title=Polio: an American story |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-19-515294-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> By 1955 the March of Dimes had invested $25.5 million in research;<ref name=HHMI_FDR>{{cite web | title = FDR and Polio: Public Life, Private Pain | publisher = Howard Hughes Medical Institute | url = http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/disease/polio/polio2.html | accessdate = 2010-02-07}}</ref> funding both Jonas Salk's and Albert Sabin's vaccine development; the 1954–55 field trial of vaccine, and supplies of free vaccine for thousands of children.<ref name=NMAH/>

In truth, however, poliomyelitis was never the monstrous killer it was portrayed as in the media, not even at its height during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1952, during the worst recorded epidemic, 3,145 people, including 1,873 children, in the United States died from polio.<ref name=Vital_Statistics_1952>{{cite book | author = Dunn HL | title = Vital Statistics of the United States (1952): Volume II, Mortality Data | publisher = United States Government Printing Office | year = 1955 | url= http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsus/VSUS_1952_2.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref> That same year over 200,000 people (including 4,000 children) died of [[cancer]] and 20,000 (including 1,500 children) died of [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=Vital_Statistics_1952/> According to [[David Oshinsky]]'s book ''Polio: An American Story'': "There is evidence that the March of Dimes over-hyped polio, and promoted an image of immediately curable polio victims, which was not true. The March of Dimes refused to partner with other charity organizations like the [[United Way of America|United Way]]."<ref name= Oshinsky/>

===Rehabilitation therapy===
[[File:Polio physical therapy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[physical therapist]] assists two polio-stricken children while they exercise their lower limbs.]]
Prior to the polio scares of the 20th century, most [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation therapy]] was focused on treating injured soldiers returning from war. The crippling effects of polio lead to heightened awareness and public support of physical rehabilitation, and in response  a number of rehabilitation centers specifically aimed at treating polio patients were opened, with the task of restoring and building the remaining strength of polio victims and teaching new, compensatory skills to large numbers of newly paralyzed individuals.<ref name= Wilson/> 

In 1926, Franklin Roosevelt, convinced of the benefits of [[hydrotherapy]], bought a resort at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], where he founded the first modern rehabilitation center for treatment of polio patients which still operates as the [[Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation]].<ref name= Ralph>{{cite journal | author = Gallagher HG | year = 2002 | url =  http://www.ralphmag.org/BR/gallagher-russia1.html | title = Disability Rights And Russia (speech) | journal = The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities | volume = XXXII | accessdate = 2010-02-07 | issue = 1}}</ref>  

The cost of polio rehabilitation was often more than the average family could afford, and more than 80% of the nation's polio patients would receive funding through the March of Dimes.<ref name= Oshinsky/> Some families also received support through philanthropic organizations such as the [[Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine]] fraternity, which established a network of pediatric hospitals in 1919, the [[Shriners Hospitals for Children]], to provide care free of charge for children with polio.<ref>{{cite news | author = Rackl L | date = 2006-06-05 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1628475.html | title = Hospital marks 80 years of treating kids for free | work = Chicago Sun-Times | accessdate = 2010-02-07}}</ref>

===Disability rights movement===

As thousands of polio survivors with varying degrees of paralysis left the rehabilitation hospitals and went home, to school and to work, many were frustrated by a lack of [[accessibility]] and  discrimination they experienced in their communities. In the early 20th century the use of a [[wheelchair]] at home or out in public was a daunting prospect as no [[public transportation]] system accommodated wheelchairs and most public buildings including schools, were inaccessible to those with disabilities.  Many children left [[disabled]] by polio were forced to attend separate institutions for "crippled children" or had to be carried up and down stairs.<ref name= Ralph/>

As people who had been paralyzed by polio matured, they began to demand the right to participate in the mainstream of society. Polio survivors were often in the forefront of the [[disability rights movement]] that emerged in the United States during the 1970s, and pushed legislation such as the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] which protected qualified individuals from discrimination based on their disability, and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990.<ref name= Ralph/><ref>{{cite book |author=Morris RB, Morris JB (editorss)|title=Encyclopedia of American History |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-06-270055-3 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> Other political movements led by polio survivors include the [[Independent Living]] and [[Universal design]] movements of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | author = Scalise K | year = 1998 | url =  http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/98legacy/02_23_98a.html | title = New collection of original documents and histories unveils disability rights movement | work = University of California at Berkeley News Release | accessdate = 2010-02-07}}</ref>

Polio survivors are one of the largest disabled groups in the world. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are 10 to 20 million polio survivors worldwide.<ref name= NewsDesk>{{cite web | url = http://www.marchofdimes.com/aboutus/791_1718.asp | title = After Effects of Polio Can Harm Survivors 40 Years Later | year = 2001 | work = March of Dimes: News Desk | accessdate = 2010-02-07}}</ref> In 1977, the National Health Interview Survey reported that there were 254,000 persons living in the United States who had been paralyzed by polio.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frick N, Bruno R |title=Post-polio sequelae: physiological and psychological overview |journal=Rehabil Lit |volume=47 |issue=5–6 |pages=106–11 |pmid=3749588|year=1986}}</ref> According to local polio support groups and doctors, some 40,000 polio survivors with varying degrees of paralysis live in Germany, 30,000 in Japan, 24,000 in France, 16,000 in Australia, 12,000 in Canada and 12,000 in the United Kingdom.<ref name= NewsDesk/>
