The '''pudendal nerve''' is a [[nerve]] in the pelvic region that carries sensory and motor, somatic and sympathetic<ref>Grant's atlas of anatomy 11th edition. pg 221</ref><ref>Knobil and Neill's Physiology of Reproduction, Volume 1. pg 1738</ref> fibers that innervate the [[external genitalia]] of both sexes, as well as sphincters for the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. It originates in [[Onuf's nucleus]] in the [[sacrum|sacral]] region of the [[spinal cord]], and travels in the S2-S4 nerves of the [[sacral plexus]].

==Anatomy==
The pudendal nerve originates in the [[sacral plexus]]; it derives its fibers from the [[ventral rami]] of the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves (S2, S3, S4).<ref name="Moore215">Moore, K.L., & Agur, A.M. (2007). ''Essential Clinical Anatomy: Third Edition.'' Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. 215. ISBN 978-0-7817-6274-8</ref>

It passes between the [[piriformis]] and [[coccygeus]] muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the [[greater sciatic foramen]]. 

It crosses the spine of the [[ischium]], and reenters the [[pelvis]] through the [[lesser sciatic foramen]]. 

It accompanies the internal pudendal vessels upward and forward along the lateral wall of the [[ischiorectal fossa]], being contained in a sheath of the [[obturator fascia]] termed the [[pudendal canal]].

The pudendal nerve gives off the [[inferior rectal nerves]].  It soon divides into two terminal branches: the [[perineal nerve]], and the [[dorsal nerve of the penis]] (in males) or the [[dorsal nerve of the clitoris]] (in females).

Research shows that variations in pudendal nerve origin are possible. For example, the pudendal nerve may actually originate off of the [[Sciatic nerve]].<ref>Unusual origin of dorsal nerve of penis and abnormal formation of pudendal nerve—Clinical significance http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0940960206000926</ref> Consequently, damage to the sciatic nerve can affect the pudendal nerve as well.

==Physiology==
The pudendal nerve innervates the [[penis]] and [[clitoris]], [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbospongiosus]] and [[ischiocavernosus muscle]]s, and areas around the [[scrotum]], [[perineum]], and [[anus]]. Its postsynaptic sympathetic fibers innervate penile [[erectile tissue]] to induce tonic coiling of the [[helicine arteries of penis]]. 

During [[erection]], this coiling is inhibited by parasympathetic fibers of the [[cavernous nerves]]. At sexual climax, the [[spasm]]s in the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernous results in [[ejaculation]] in the male and most of the feelings of [[orgasm]] in both sexes.

==Pathology==
Difficult [[childbirth]] or [[bicycling]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mellion MB |title=Common cycling injuries. Management and prevention |journal=Sports Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=52–70 |year=1991 |month=January |pmid=2011683 |doi= 10.2165/00007256-199111010-00004|url=}}</ref> can compress or stretch the pudendal nerve, causing temporary loss of function, but permanent injury is rare.  [[Pudendal nerve entrapment|Entrapment]] of the nerve is very rare but can happen.  A pelvic tumor (most notably a large [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]]), or surgery to remove the tumor, can damage this nerve permanently. A ''[[Pudendal anesthesia|pudendal nerve block]]'', also known as a ''saddle nerve block'' is a common obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maternal, Neonatal, and Women's Health Nursing, Volume 1|author=Lynna Y. Littleton, Joan Engebretson|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2002|page=727}}</ref>

The pudendal nerve terminal motor latency test is a diagnostic procedure used to quantify the length of time it takes for the anal sphincter to respond to the electrical stimulus of the pudendal nerve using a St. Mark's electrode. Prolonged motor latency can be an indicator of the extent of idiopathic and childbirth related neurological damage to the pudendal nerve, and can provide some indication regarding potential recovery.

==Radiology==
The pudendal nerve is difficult to visualize on routine [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] or [[MRI|MR imaging]], however under CT guidance, a needle may be placed adjacent to the pudendal neurovascular bundle.  The ischial spine, an easily identifiable structure on [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], is used as the level of injection.  A spinal needle is advanced via the gluteal muscles and advanced within several millimeters of the ischial spine.  Contrast (X-ray dye) is then injected, highlighting the nerve in the canal, confirming correct needle placement.  The nerve may then be injected with cortisone and local anaesthetic to confirm and also treat chronic pain of the external genitalia (known as [[vulvodynia]] in females), pelvic and anorectal pain<ref>{{cite journal |author=Calvillo O, Skaribas IM, Rockett C. |title=Computed tomography-guided pudendal nerve block. A new diagnostic approach to long-term anoperineal pain: a report of two cases. |journal=Reg Anesth Pain Med |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=420–3 |year=2000 |pmid=10925942 |url= |doi=10.1053/rapm.2000.7620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hough DM, Wittenberg KH, Pawlina W, Maus TP, King BF, Vrtiska TJ, Farrell MA, Antolak SJ Jr. |title=Chronic perineal pain caused by pudendal nerve entrapment: anatomy and CT-guided perineural injection technique. |journal=Am J Roentgenol |volume=181 |issue=2 |pages=561–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12876048 |url=}}</ref>  In rare cases, the nerve may be destroyed with either alcoholic or radiofrequency ablation.
