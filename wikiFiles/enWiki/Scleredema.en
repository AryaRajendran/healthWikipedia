==Diagnosis==
The scleredema is usually proposed as a diagnosis based on the appearance of the skin and the patient's medical history. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor performs a [[skin biopsy]], in which hematoxylin and eosin staining will show a thick [[reticular dermis]] with thick [[collagen]] bundles separated by clear spaces.<ref name="pmid14594584">{{cite journal |author=Schmults CA |title=Scleredema |journal=Dermatol.

==Treatment==
Although many types of medications have been tried as treatments, none of them have been proven effective in treating scleredema. Those treatments, such as [[corticosteroids]], may benefit the patient, but will not [[cure]] their condition. If the affected area is infected, it is usually treated immediately. The symptoms of the condition usually resolve within six months to two years after onset. However, patients whose condition was associated to diabetes may suffer for longer periods of time.<ref name='about'/>

[[Myocarditis]] resulting as a complication from the disease has been successfully treated with [[penicillin]] and [[steroids]].<ref name='karger'>{{cite web|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Doi=173618 |title=Buschke's Sclerema with right-sided heart failure. |accessdate=2009-05-18 }}</ref>
