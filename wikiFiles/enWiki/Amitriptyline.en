'''Amitriptyline''' ('''Tryptomer''', '''Elavil''', '''Tryptizol''', '''Laroxyl''', '''Saroten''', '''Sarotex''', '''Lentizol''', '''Endep''') is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA). It is the most widely used TCA and has at least equal efficacy against [[major depression|depression]] as the newer class of [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s according to a study from early 2001.<ref name="pmid11157426">{{cite journal | author = Barbui C, Hotopf M | title = Amitriptyline v. the rest: still the leading antidepressant after 40 years of randomised controlled trials | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry : the Journal of Mental Science | volume = 178 | issue = 2| pages = 129–144 | year = 2001 | month = February | pmid = 11157426 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.178.2.129| url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11157426}}</ref> As well as reducing depressive symptoms, these types of tricyclics also ease migraines, tension headaches, anxiety attacks and some schizophrenic symptoms. It is also known to reduce aggression and violent behavior.

==Medical uses==
Amitriptyline is used for a number of medical conditions including: [[depressive disorders]], [[anxiety disorders]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[migraine]] prophylaxis, [[eating disorders]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-herpetic neuralgia]], and [[insomnia]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Amitriptyline Hydrochloride
|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/amitriptyline-hydrochloride.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Amitriptyline is used in [[ankylosing spondylitis]] for [[pain]] relief. It is also used as a preventive for patients with recurring [[biliary dyskinesia]] ([[sphincter of Oddi]] dysfunction).<ref name="Hubscher">S. G. Hubscher et al. (2006). Functional biliary type pain syndrome. In P. J. Pasricha, W. D. Willis & G. F. Gebhart (Eds.), ' ' italics' ' Chronic Abdominal and Visceral Pain' 'italics' '. London: Informa Healthcare, pp. 459-461.</ref>

Amitriptyline is also used in the treatment of [[nocturnal enuresis]] (bedwetting) in children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Bedwetting-Medicine-Treatments.htm |title=Desmopressin for Bedwetting - Health |publisher=Patient.co.uk |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>

Amitriptyline may be prescribed for other conditions such as cyclic vomiting syndrome, [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD),<ref>National Institute for Clinical Excellence: [http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG026publicinfo.pdf The Treatment of PTSD in Adults and Children]</ref> [[chronic pain]], [[tinnitus]], [[chronic cough]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] (CTS), [[fibromyalgia]], [[vulvodynia]], [[interstitial cystitis]], [[UCPPS|male chronic pelvic pain syndrome]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), [[diabetic neuropathy|diabetic peripheral neuropathy]], [[neurological]] pain, laryngeal sensory neuropathy, chronic fatigue syndrome and painful [[paresthesia]]s related to [[multiple sclerosis]]. Typically lower dosages are required for pain modification of 10 to 50&nbsp;mg daily.<ref name="BNF">[[British National Formulary]] '''45''' (March 2003).</ref>

A [[randomized controlled trial]] published in June 2005 found that amitriptyline was effective in [[functional dyspepsia]] that did not respond to a first-line treatment ([[famotidine]] or [[mosapride]]).<ref name="pmid15943846">{{cite journal |author=Otaka M |title=New strategy of therapy for functional dyspepsia using famotidine, mosapride and amitriptyline |journal=Aliment.

==Adverse effects==
The main two side effects that occur from taking amitriptyline are drowsiness and a dry mouth. Other common [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of using amitriptyline are mostly due to its [[anticholinergic]] activity, including: weight gain, changes in appetite, muscle stiffness, nausea, constipation, nervousness, dizziness, [[tremor]], blurred vision, [[urinary retention]], and changes in sexual function. Some rare side effects include seizures, [[tinnitus]], [[hypotension]], [[mania]], [[psychosis]], [[sleep paralysis]], [[hypnagogic]] or [[hypnopompic]] hallucinations related to sleep paralysis, [[heart block]], [[arrhythmias]], lip and mouth ulcers, [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], [[clinical depression|depression]], tingling pain or numbness in the feet or hands, yellowing of the eyes or skin, pain or difficulty passing urine, confusion, abnormal production of milk in females, breast enlargement in both males and females, fever with increased sweating, and suicidal thoughts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/goldcontent/amitriptyline/2?brand=#ixzz146yDqBbf |title=Connect to Better Health |publisher=Healthline.com |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> The Indianapolis Discovery Network for Dementia (IDND) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indydiscoverynetwork.org/AnticholinergicCognitiveBurdenScale.html |title=IDND: Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale |publisher=Indydiscoverynetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> rates amitriptyline as having definite anticholinergic effects. A side effect of many commonly used drugs with such effects appears to be to increase the risks of both cognitive impairment and death in older people, according to research led by the [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfas.ac.uk/ |title=CFAS |publisher=CFAS |date=2009-01-16 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>
Amitriptyline can induce [[hepatotoxicity]].<ref>Drug-induced liver disease By Neil Kaplowitz, Laurie D.

===Overdose===
{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs. The [[British National Formulary]] notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/3295.htm |title=British National Formulary |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> thus it and other tricyclic antidepressants are no longer recommended as first line therapy for depression. Alternative agents, SSRIs and SNRIs are safer in overdose, though they are no more efficacious than TCAs. English folk singer, [[Nick Drake]], died from an overdose of Tryptizol in 1974.

==Pharmacology==
Amitriptyline acts primarily as a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]], with strong actions on the [[serotonin transporter]] and moderate effects on the [[norepinephrine transporter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsforum.com/content/pictures/imagebank/hirespng/antidep_uptake_specific.png |title=Potency of antidepressants to block noradrenaline reuptake |publisher=CNS Forum |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref><ref name="pmid9537821">{{Cite pmid|9537821}}</ref> It has negligible influence on the [[dopamine transporter]] and therefore does not affect [[dopamine]] [[reuptake]], being nearly 1,000 times weaker on it than on [[serotonin]].<ref name="pmid9537821" />

Amitriptyline additionally functions as a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]], [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]], [[5-HT6 receptor|5-HT<sub>6</sub>]], [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub>]], [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]], [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]], [[H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub>]],<ref name="EllisEllis1987">{{cite book | author1 = Albert Ellis | author2 = Gwynn Pennant Ellis | title = Progress in Medicinal Chemistry | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=jr0u58hFDhEC&pg=PA56 | accessdate = 27 November 2011 | date = 1 January 1987 | publisher = Elsevier | isbn = 978-0-444-80876-9 | page = 56}}</ref> [[H4 receptor|H<sub>4</sub>]],<ref name="pmid11179435">{{cite journal | author = Nguyen T, Shapiro DA, George SR, ''et al.'' | title = Discovery of a novel member of the histamine receptor family | journal = Molecular Pharmacology | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 427–33 | year = 2001 | month = March | pmid = 11179435 | doi = | url = http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11179435}}</ref><ref name="Yogeeswari2010">{{cite book | author = D.

==History==
Amitriptyline, under the brand name '''Elavil''', was developed by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] and approved by the [[Food and drug administration|FDA]] on April 7, 1961, for the treatment of [[major depression]] in the United States.<ref name="pmid18204333">{{cite journal | author = Fangmann P, Assion HJ, Juckel G, González CA, López-Muñoz F | title = Half a century of antidepressant drugs: on the clinical introduction of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics, and tetracyclics.
