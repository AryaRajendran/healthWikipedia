==Biography==
He was born in [[Hünfelden|Dauborn]], [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]]. He earned his medical degree from the [[University of Giessen]] in 1854. As a young physician he studied with [[Franciscus Cornelis Donders]] in [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]], [[Sir William Bowman, 1st Baronet|William Bowman]] in [[London]], [[Albrecht von Graefe]] in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. From 1860 until 1868 he was a professor of [[ophthalmology]] at Heidelberg.

He emigrated to [[New York City]], where he worked as a [[surgeon]]. In 1869 he founded the New York Ophthalmic and Aural Institute, which from 1913 to 1939 was called the Herman Knapp Memorial Hospital. In 1882, he was made professor of the [[New York University]] Medical College. In 1888, he was appointed professor of ophthalmology at the [[New York College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]], [[Columbia University]], and in 1902 he became emeritus professor. His son, Arnold Knapp (1869–1956) was also a noted ophthalmologist.

In 1869, with [[Salomon Moos]] (1831–1895), he founded the "Archives of Ophthalmology and Otology" (''Archiv für Augen- und Ohrenheilkunde''), an international scientific monthly journal that was published in [[Wiesbaden]] (ing German) and New York (in English). In 1878 the archives split into two independent entities; as the "Archives of Ophthalmology" (''Archiv für Augenheilkunde'') and the "Journal of Otology" (''Zeitschrift für Ohrenheilkunde'').

His name is lent to the eponymous "Knapp streaks"; also known as [[angioid streaks]], which are tiny breaks in the [[elastin]]-filled [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] in the back of the [[human eye|eye]]. He devised his own version of an ophthalmotrope, a device used in [[physiology|physiological]] [[optics]] to demonstrate the action of ocular muscles individually or in various combinations. Several instruments used in [[eye surgery]] bear his name, including the "Knapp [[trachoma]] [[forceps]]".
