'''FibroTest''', known as FibroSure in the US, is a patented [[biomarker]] test that uses the results of six [[blood serum]] tests to generate a score that is correlated with the degree of [[liver]] damage in people with a variety of liver diseases. FibroTest has the same prognostic value as a liver biopsy.

FibroTest has been evaluated in relation to [[liver biopsy]] (the current reference standard in liver disease assessment) in a large number of patients with [[hepatitis C]],<ref name="pmid16931569" /> [[hepatitis B]],<ref name="pmid18973844" /> [[alcoholic liver disease]],<ref name="pmid15704051" /> [[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]<ref name="pmid16503961" /> and in the general population. By 2008 it had been used in over 350,000 patients.<ref name="pmid18973844">{{cite journal |author= Halfon P, Munteanu M, Poynard T|title= FibroTest-ActiTest as a non-invasive marker of liver ﬁbrosis  |journal= Gastroenterol Clin Biol |volume=32|issue=6 |pages=22–39 |year=2008 |pmid= 18973844 |doi=10.1016/S0399-8320(08)73991-5}}</ref> FibroTest has been validated for the initial diagnosis of fibrosis, but also for the monitoring of patients.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  In 2006, the French National Authority for Health recommended the use of FibroTest as a first-line assessment tool for fibrosis with untreated chronic hepatitis C.<ref>[http://www.has-sante.fr/portail/jcms/c_476504/prise-en-charge-des-patients-a-risque-de-cirrhose-amelioration-de-levaluation-de-la-fibrose-hepatique-et-du-diagnostic-de-la-cirrhose-non-compliquee Publication of 'Haute Autorité de Santé' (fr)]</ref>

==Procedure==
The FibroTest score is calculated from the results of a six-parameter blood test, combining six serum markers with the age and gender of the patient: [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]], [[Haptoglobin]], [[Apolipoprotein A1]], [[Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase]] (GGT), Total [[bilirubin]], and [[Alanine transaminase]] (ALT). ALT is used in a second assessment called ActiTest that is part of FibroTest.

The equation for calculating the FibroTest score regression coefficient ([[logistic regression]]) is:<ref>[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6631330/fulltext.html U.S. patent 6,631,330]</ref>

<math>z=4.467\times \log_{10} [\alpha2 macroglobulin (g/L)]-1.357\times\log_{10} [Haptoglobin (g/L)] + 1.017 \times \log_{10} [GGT (IU/L)] + 0.0281 \times [Age (years)]</math>

:<math>+ 1.737 \times \log_{10} [Bilirubin (\mu mol/L)] - 1.184 \times [Apo A1 (g/L)] + 0.301 \times Sex (female=0, male=1)-5.54</math>

Due to variability of components assays and analyzers, FibroTest assays can only be performed in validated laboratories.<ref name="pmid15080567">{{cite journal |author= Imbert-Bismut F, Messous D, Thibault V, Myers RB, Piton A, Thabut D, et al. |title= Intra-laboratory analytical variability of biochemical markers of fibrosis (Fibrotest) and activity (Actitest) and references ranges in healthy blood donors.  |journal= Clin Chem Lab Med| volume=42|pages=323–333 |year=2004 |pmid=15080567 |doi= 10.1515/CCLM.2004.058 |issue= 3 }}</ref> FibroTest cannot be used without algorithms that detects false positives and false negatives; the equation alone is not a diagnosis tool.

The laboratory or physician connects to the BioPredictive website<ref>[http://www.biopredictive.com FibroTest website]</ref> for calculation of the test results and prints the results sheet, which is available immediately and is accompanied by an interpretation aid and precautions for use.

==Applicability==
Over 95% of tests are interpretable and allow a diagnosis of fibrosis and liver activity. In less than 5% of cases, likely false positives or false negatives are highlighted.

The tests are not applicable in 1 to 5% of cases. These cases can be detected by laboratory safety algorithms and when detected they are indicated on the results sheet:<ref name="pmid18973844" />

* Acute hepatitides, e.g., acute viral hepatitis A, B, C, D, E; drug-induced hepatitis

* Extrahepatic cholestasis, e.g., pancreatic cancer, gallstones

* Severe hemolysis, e.g., some cardiac valves

* Gilbert's syndrome with high unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

* Acute inflammatory syndrome (the blood test may be postponed)

==Comparison with liver biopsy==
[[Liver biopsy]] is an imperfect tool; due to sampling errors, biopsy size (5 to 30&nbsp;mm) and intra- and interobservor variability, it is now agreed that biopsy is an "imperfect [[Gold Standard]]".  Biopsy continues to present inconveniences: 30% of patients complain of pain, up to 3% have been noted to have complications severe enough to require hospitalization<ref name="pmid8416324">{{cite journal|author= Janes and Lindor |title= Outcome of patients hospitalized for complications after outpatient liver biopsy.|first2= KD|last2= Lindor|last=Janes|journal= Ann Intern Med |volume=118|issue=2 |pages=96–8 |year=1993|pmid= 8416324}}</ref><ref name="pmid9581674">{{cite journal|author= Pasha et al. |title= Cost-effectiveness of ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.|first5= Keith D.|last5= Lindor|first4= E.

There is a mean discordance of 25% between FibroTest and biopsy.

==FibroTest derivatives==
Four other tests derive from FibroTest, and are part of the FibroMax package of tests:

* ActiTest: diagnostic of necrotico-inflammatory for hepatitis;

* SteaoTest: diagnostic for liver [[steatosis]];

* NashTest: diagnostic for [[NASH]] (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) inflammation;

* AshTest: diagnostic for [[Alcoholic liver disease]] inflammation.

==Patent, License==
FibroTest tests and derivatives are patented since 2001 by APHP ([[Assistance publique - Hôpitaux de Paris]]), the Parisian public hospital system. In the US, FibroTest is marketed as FibroSure (a [[LabCorp]] trademark). [[BioPredictive]] is the company licensed by APHP to promote and operate the tests.
