During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), many towns and areas of the Circum-[[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and East Central Europe suffered from a severe outbreak of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with a peak from 1708 to 1712. This [[epidemic]] was probably part of a [[pandemic]] affecting an area from Central Asia to the Mediterranean. Most probably via Constantinople, it spread to [[Pińczów]] in southern Poland, where it was first recorded in a Swedish military hospital in 1702. The plague then followed trade, travel and army routes, reached the Baltic coast at [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] in 1709, affected areas all around the Baltic Sea by 1711 and reached [[Hamburg]] by 1712. Therefore, the course of the war and the course of the plague mutually affected each other: while soldiers and refugees were often agents of the plague, the death toll in the military as well as the depopulation of towns and rural areas sometimes severely impacted the ability to resist enemy forces or to supply troops.

This plague was the last to affect the Circum-Baltic, which had experienced several waves of the plague since the [[Black Death]] of the 14th century. However, for some areas, it was the most severe. People died within a few days of first showing symptoms. Especially on the eastern coast from Prussia to [[Estonia]], the average death toll for wide areas was up to two thirds or three quarters of the population, and many farms and villages were left completely desolated. It is, however, hard to distinguish between deaths due to a genuine plague infection and deaths due to starvation and other diseases that spread along with the plague. While [[Bubonic plague|buboes]] are recorded among the symptoms, contemporary means of diagnosis were poorly developed, and death records are often unspecific, incomplete or lost. Some towns and areas were affected only for one year, while in other places the plague recurred annually throughout several subsequent years. In some areas, a disproportionally high death toll is recorded for children and women, which may be due to famine and the men being drafted.

As the cause of the plague was unknown to contemporaries, with speculations reaching from religious causes over "[[Miasma theory|bad air]]" to contaminated clothes, the only means of fighting the disease was containment, to separate the ill from the healthy. [[Cordon sanitaire|Cordons sanitaire]] were established around infected towns like [[Stralsund]] and [[Königsberg]]; one was also established around the whole [[Duchy of Prussia]] and another one between [[Scania]] and the Danish isles along the [[Öresund|Sound]], with [[Saltholm]] as the central [[quarantine]] station. "Plague houses" to quarantine infected people were established within or before the city walls, a notable example of the latter being the [[Charité]] of [[Berlin]], which was, however, spared from the plague.

==Background==

Local outbreaks of the [[plague (disease)|plague]] are grouped into three plague [[pandemic]]s, whereby the respective start and end dates and the assignment of some outbreaks to one or another pandemic are still subject to discussion.<ref name=Frandsen13>Frandsen (2009), p. 13.</ref> According to Joseph P. Byrne from [[Belmont University]], the pandemics were:
*the first plague pandemic from 541 to ~750, spreading from [[Egypt]] to the [[Mediterranean]] (starting with the [[Plague of Justinian]]) and northwestern [[Europe]]<ref name=Byrnexxi>Byrne (2012), p. xxi.</ref>
*the second plague pandemic from ~1345 to ~1840, spreading from [[Central Asia]] to the Mediterranean and Europe (starting with the [[Black Death]]), and probably also to [[China]]<ref name=Byrnexxi/>
*the third plague pandemic from 1866 to the 1960s, spreading from China to various places around the world, notably the [[USA|US]]-American west coast and [[India]].<ref name=Byrnexxi>Byrne (2012), p. xxii.</ref>
However, the late medieval Black Death is sometimes seen not as the start of the second, but as the end of the first pandemic – in that case, the second pandemic's start would be 1361; the end dates of the second pandemic given in literature also vary, e.g. ~1890 instead of ~1840.<ref name=Frandsen13/> 

The plague during the Great Northern War falls within the second pandemic, which by the late 17th century had its final recurrence in Western Europe (e.g. the [[Great Plague of London]] 1666–68) and, in the 18th century final recurrences in the rest of Europe (e.g. the plague during the Great Northern War in the Circum-Baltic, the [[Great Plague of Marseille]] 1720–22 in southern Europe, and the [[Russian plague of 1770-1772]] in eastern Europe), being thereafter confined to less severe outbreaks in ports of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the 1830s.<ref>Byrne (2012), p. 322; for the Circum-Baltic Frandsen (2009), title and Kroll (2006), p. 139.</ref> 

In the late 17th century, the plague had retreated from Europe, making a last appearance in [[Northern Germany]] in 1682 and vanishing from the continent in 1684.<ref>Sticker (1908), pp. 208–209.</ref> The subsequent wave hitting Europe during the Great Northern War most probably had its origins in [[Central Asia]], spreading to Europe via [[Anatolia]] and [[Constantinople]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=Frandsen20>Frandsen (2009), p. 20.</ref> Georg Sticker numbered this epidemic as the "12th period" of plague epidemics, first recorded in [[Ahmedabad]] in 1683 and until 1724 affecting a territory from [[India]] over [[Persia]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]] to [[Nubia]] and [[Ethiopia]] as well as to [[Morocco]] and southern [[France]] on the one hand and to East Central Europe up to [[Scandinavia]] on the other hand.<ref>Sticker (1908), pp. 209 ff.</ref> Constantinople was reached in 1685 and remained a site of infection for the subsequent years.<ref>Sticker (1908), pp. 210 ff.</ref> Sporadically, the plague had entered [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] since 1697, yet the wave of the plague that met and followed the armies of the [[Great Northern War]] was first recorded in [[Poland]] in 1702.<ref>Sticker (1908), p. 213.</ref>

Along with the plague, other diseases like [[dysentery]], [[smallpox]] and [[spotted fever]] spread during the war, and at least in some regions the population encountered those while starving.<ref name=Frandsen20/> Already in 1695-1697, a great [[famine]] had already [[Great Famine of Finland (1695–1697)|struck Finland]] (death toll between a quarter and a third of the population), [[Great Famine of Estonia (1695–1697)|Estonia]] (death toll about a fifth of the population), Livonia, and Lithuania<ref>Munzar (1995), p. 167.</ref> (where the famine as well as epidemics and warfare killed half of the population of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] between 1648 and 1697).<ref>O'Connor (2003), p. 19.</ref> In addition, [[Great Frost of 1709|the winter of 1708-1709 was exceptionally long and severe]];<ref>Lenke (1964), p. 3: ''"the winter of 1708/09 must have been the coldest hitherto known in Central Europe;"'' in detail pp. 27-35.</ref> as a result, the winter seed froze to death in Denmark and Prussia, and the soil had to be plowed and tilled again in the spring.<ref>Frandsen (2006), p. 205.</ref>

==1702–1706: Southern Poland-Lithuania, Ukraine==

By 1702, the armies of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] had repelled and taken up pursuit of the armies of [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus the Strong]], [[Elector of Saxony]], [[king of Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], defeating them in July [[Battle of Klissow|at Klissow]] near [[Pińczów]] on the [[Nida (river)|Nida]] in southern Poland.<ref>Frost (2000), p. 273; Frandsen (2009), p. 20; details of the battle locations in Hatton (1968), pp. 183–184.</ref> In their military hospital in Pińczów, the Swedish army suffered its first plague infections of soldiers, recorded on the basis of reports from "trustworthy people from that very land" by Danzig (Gdańsk) physician Johann Christoph Gottwald.<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 20, 495; Sahm (1905), p. 35; Gottwald (1710), p. 1: ''"So wie mir berichtet worden/und ich von glaubwürdigen Leuten aus dem Lande selbst erfahren können [...]"''.</ref> In Poland, the plague recurred in various places until 1714.<ref name=Sticker213>Sticker (1908), p. 213.</ref> 

During the following two years, plague broke out in [[Ukraine]], [[Podolia]] and [[Volhynia]], with [[Lviv]] (Lemberg, Lwow) suffering ~10,000 plague deaths in 1704 and 1705 (~40% of all inhabitants).<ref name=Frandsen20/> From 1705 to 1706, occurrences of plague in Poland-Lithuania were also recorded in [[Kolomyja|Kołomyję]]{{dn|date=November 2012}} (Kolomyja, Kolomea), [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanisławów]] (Stanislaviv, Stanislau), [[Stryi|Stryj]] (Stryi), [[Sambir|Sambor]] (Sambir), [[Przemyśl]], and [[Jarosław]].<ref name=Burchardt80>Burchardt et al. (2009), p. 80.</ref>

==Spread in Poland-Lithuania after 1706==

After the Swedish incursion, Poland-Lithuania was in a state of civil war between the [[Warsaw Confederation (1704)|Warsaw Confederation]], [[Treaty of Warsaw (1705)|supportive of]] the pro-Swedish king [[Stanisław Leszczyński]], and the [[Sandomierz Confederation]], [[Treaty of Narva|supportive of]] Sweden's adversaries, i.e. the [[Peter the Great|Russian tsar]] and August the Strong, who was [[Treaty of Altranstädt (1706)|forced to abdicate in 1706]] by Charles XII.

In 1707,<ref name=Sticker213/> the plague reached [[Cracow]], where according to Frandsen (2009) ~20,000 people died within three years,<ref name=Frandsen20/> according to Sticker (1905) ~18,000 people within two years, most in 1707,<ref name=Sticker213/> and according to Burchardt et al. (2009) ~12,000 people between 1706 and 1709.<ref name=Burchardt80/> From Cracow, the plague spread to [[Lesser Poland]] (the surrounding area), [[Mazovia]] (including the city of [[Warsaw]]) and [[Great Poland]] with the cities of [[Ostrów Wielkopolski|Ostrów]], [[Kalisz]] (Kalisch) and [[Poznan]] (Posen).<ref name=Burchardt80/> In Warsaw, ~30,000 people died in annually recurring plague epidemics between 1707 and 1710.<ref name=Frandsen20/> Poznan lost ~9,000 people,<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 20; Burchardt et al. (2009), p. 82.</ref> about two thirds of its 14,000 inhabitants, to the plague between 1707 and 1709.<ref>Burchardt et al. (2009), p. 82.</ref> In 1708, the plague spread north to the war-torn town of [[Toruń|Thorn]] (Torun) in [[Royal Prussia]], killing more than 4,000 people.<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 25.</ref>

When news of the plague in Poland arrived in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], then still neutral in the war,<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 24.</ref> precautions were taken to prevent it spreading across the border. From 1704, health certificates were compulsory for travellers from Poland.<ref name=Frandsen33>Frandsen (2009), p. 33.</ref> From 1707, a broad [[cordon sanitaire]] extended around the border of the former [[Duchy of Prussia]], and those crossing into the Prussian exclave were [[quarantine]]d.<ref>Sahm (1905), p. 35; Frandsen (2009), p. 33.</ref> Yet the border was long and wooded, and not all roads could be guarded; thus bridges were demolished, lesser roads blocked, and orders were given to hang people avoiding the guarded crossings and burn or fumigate all incoming goods.<ref name=Frandsen33/> There were, however, many exemptions for people with cross-border estates or occupations, who were allowed to pass freely.<ref>Sahm (1905), pp. 35–38.</ref> 

==Spread in the Circum-Baltic 1708–1713==
===Prussia===
[[File:Pest in Danzig 1709.png|thumb|250px|Samuel Donnet: ''Illustration of the Great Plague in Danzig (Gdansk) 1709'', contemporary woodcut with an annotation noting the death toll]]

A few days after a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] official in [[Soldau]] forwarded the information that on 18 August 1708 the plague had reached the village of [[Piekielko]]{{dn|date=November 2012}} on the Polish side of the border, the epidemic had crossed into the village of [[Bialutten]] on the Prussian side, killing most of its inhabitants within a month.<ref name=Sahm38Frandsen33>detailed in Sahm (1905), p. 38; cf. Frandsen (2009), p. 33.</ref> The Prussian authorities reacted by containing the village with a [[palisade]]; however, the survivors, led by the local reverend, had already taken refuge in the nearby woods.<ref name=Sahm38>Sahm (1905), p. 38.</ref> On 13 September 1708, a Prussian official from [[Hohenstein (Ostpreußen)|Hohenstein]] reported that the plague had been brought to this small border town by the son of the local hatter returning from Polish service.<ref name=Sahm38/> By December, 400 people had died in Hohenstein.<ref name=Frandsen33/> While the plague faded out during the [[Great Frost of 1709|hard winter]], food became scarce due to war contributions and conscription, and the cordon sanitaire and the respective restrictions were lifted by edict on 12 July 1709.<ref name=Frandsen33/>

In January 1709, the plague reached [[Pillupönen]] in the rural Prussian east,<ref name=Frandsen38>Frandsen (2009), p. 38</ref> and by the end of the winter it reached [[Danzig]] (Gdansk).<ref name=Kroll&GabinskyDanzig>Kroll&Gabinsky (retrieved 2012): [https://www.phf.uni-rostock.de/imd/Forschung/HomeMare2/Seuchenzug/Staedte/Danzig.html Danzig.]</ref> Danzig, at that time a largely autonomous, Protestant and German-speaking town in Polish [[Royal Prussia]], had become one of the greatest towns in the circum-Baltic area due to its position as a hub between Polish trade (via the [[Vistula]]) and international trade (via the [[Baltic Sea]]).<ref name=Frandsen23>Frandsen (2009), p. 23.</ref> While it had so far avoided participation in the war, the conflict had affected it indirectly by a reduction of its trade volume, rising taxes<ref name=Frandsen23/> and food shortages.<ref name=Frandsen27>Frandsen (2009), p. 27.</ref> The city council adopted a dual strategy of actively downplaying the plague to the outside world, especially Danzig's trading partners,<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 27, 31.</ref> thus keeping the city open and allowing international and local trade to continue with few restrictions,<ref name=Frandsen27/> while at the same time the restrictions on burials were eased due to a coffin shortage and the deaths of many grave diggers, plague (pest) houses and new graveyards were designated,<ref name=Frandsen26>Frandsen (2009), p. 26.</ref> and a "health commission" to organize the anti-plague measures was implemented to, for example, collect weekly reports from the physicians and provide the plague victims with food.<ref name=Frandsen27/> Until the end of May, it seemed that the plague would not be as severe, and the health commission's reports were openly accessible. However, the plague was not contained and spread from the plague houses to the poorer suburbs and surrounding countryside, and starting in early June the death toll rose significantly.<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 26–27.</ref> The health commission's reports were then declared secret.<ref name=Frandsen27/> When the plague faded out by December 1709<ref name=Frandsen27/> never to return to Danzig,<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 28.</ref> the town had lost about half of its inhabitants.<ref name=Frandsen26/> 

The next large town to the east of Danzig was [[Königsberg]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian kingdom]], which had so far profited from the war by taking over some of the Swedish and Polish Livonian trade.<ref name=Frandsen33>Frandsen (2009), p. 33.</ref> In preparation for the plague, a ''Collegium Sanitatis'' (health commission) was set up,<ref name=Frandsen33/> including physicians from the university and leading civilian and military officials of the town.<ref name=Frandsen34>Frandsen (2009), p. 34, Herden (2005), p. 66.</ref> The plague arrived in August 1709, most probably carried by a Danzig sailor.<ref name=Frandsen35>Frandsen (2009), p. 35.</ref> The provincial government was exiled to [[Wehlau]] while the chancellor, von Kreytzen, remained in Königsberg and continued to work as the chairman of the Collegium Sanitatis, which met daily.<ref name=Frandsen34/> The city walls were manned by the military, the burghers were conscripted into neighborhood watches, medical and other personnel was hired, dressed in black waxed clothes and housed in separate buildings.<ref name=Herden66>Herden (2005), p. 66.</ref> While at first the city authorities downplayed the plague, which had reached a peak in early October and then declined, this approach was abandoned when the death toll again started to rise significantly in November.<ref name=Frandsen35/> Without prior public announcement, a [[cordon sanitaire]] was implemented around the city, sealing it off completely from the surrounding countryside from 14/15 November until 21 December 1709.<ref name=Herden66/> When the plague had fully retreated from Königsberg by mid-1710, more than 9,500 townspeople had died,<ref name=Kroll&GabinskyKbg>Kroll&Gabinsky (retrieved 2012): [https://www.phf.uni-rostock.de/imd/Forschung/HomeMare2/Seuchenzug/Staedte/K%C3%B6nigsberg.html Königsberg.]</ref> about a quarter of its population.<ref name=Kroll137>Kroll (2006), p. 137.</ref>

Located between Danzig and Königsberg, the town of [[Elbing]] (Elblag) became infected in late September 1709, probably by shoemakers travelling from [[Silesia]].<ref name=Frandsen29>Frandsen (2009), p. 29.</ref> Unusual compared to the plague in other places, the Elbing plague peaked in October 1709, faded out in the winter, peaked again in the spring 1710, faded in the summer, and peaked for a last time in the fall before vanishing in the winter, having killed about 1,200 people or 15% of the population each year.<ref name=Frandsen29/> This led Frandsen (2009) to speculate whether it was indeed the plague that raged in Elbing, a thorough analysis is however difficult due to the loss of the town's plague records in [[World War II]].<ref name=Frandsen29/> On the other hand, some Elbing burghers profited from the plague in the neighboring cities insofar as its skippers were allowed to enter non-infected houses in Königsberg and, according to Frandsen (2009), "carried out an illegal, but probably very useful and lucrative trade between Königsberg and Danzig."<ref name=Frandsen31>Frandsen (2009), p. 31.</ref> Elbing had protected its population by guarding its walls and enforcing a 40-day quarantine on incoming persons.<ref name=Frandsen31/>

However, [[East Prussia]] (the former [[Duchy of Prussia]], since 1701 a province of the kingdom with the same name), where the plague had first occurred in late 1708 (see above) and returned from 1709 to 1711, lost more than 200,000<ref name=Kroll138>Kroll (2006), p. 138.</ref> and up to 245,000 inhabitants,<ref name=Kossert96>Kossert (2005), p. 96.</ref> which was more than a third of its population of ~600,000.<ref>Kroll (2006), p. 138; Kossert (2005), p. 96.</ref> The peasants had been weakened by crop failures and pressured by high taxes: while 38.4% of [[Frederick I of Prussia|king Frederick]]'s subjects lived in eastern Prussia, the revenues gathered from this province accounted for only 16.4% of the kingdom's total tax income by the end of the 17th century, thereafter taxes for the peasants were increased by 65% from the outbreak of the war in 1700 until the outbreak of the plague in 1708.<ref name=Kossert96/> When the [[Great Frost of 1709|hard winter of 1708/09]] annilihated the winter seed, [[dysentery]] and [[hunger typhus]] further weakened the population.<ref name=Kossert96/> As a consequence, according to Kossert (2005), "the peasants were easy pray for the plague, as their physical condition was miserable,"<ref>Kossert (2005), p. 96: ''"Die Pest hatte leichte Beute, denn die körperliche Verfassung der bäuerlichen Bevölkerung war erbärmlich."''</ref> and 10,800 farms were completely deserted.<ref name=Kossert107>Kossert (2005), p. 107.</ref> Especially hard-hit were regions with a substantial non-German population: [[Masuria]] in the south as well as the eastern counties with a substantial [[Lithuania Minor|Lithuanian peasant population]].<ref name=Kossert109>Kossert (2005), p. 109.</ref> About 128,000 people died in the [[Amt (country subdivision)|''ämter'']] (rural districts) of [[Insterburg]], [[Klaipeda|Memel]], [[Ragnit]] and [[Tilsit]],<ref name=Kossert96/> and the number of villages populated completely by Lithuanians sank from 1,830 before the plague to 35 thereafter.<ref name=Kossert109/> While indigenous, including Lithuanian population was included in the subsequent repopulation measures,<ref name=Kossert107/> the ethnic make-up of the province changed<ref name=Kossert109/> with the settlement of mostly German-speaking immigrants, most of whom were Protestants seeking refuge from religious prosecution (''"Exulanten"'').<ref>Kossert (2005), pp. 104-110.</ref>

===Brandenburg===

In November 1709, when the Prussian king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] returned to [[Berlin]] from a meeting with Russian tsar [[Peter the Great]], the king had a strange encounter with his mentally deranged wife [[Sophia Louise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Sophia Louise]], who in a white dress and with bloody hands pointed at him saying that the plague would devour the king of Babylon.<ref>Jaeckel (1999), p. 14.</ref> As there was a legend of a [[White_Lady_(ghost)#Germany|White Lady]] foretelling the deaths of the Hohenzollern, Frederick took his wife's outburst seriously<ref>Jaeckel (1999), p. 15.</ref> and ordered that precautions be taken for his residence city.<ref name=Jaeckel16>Jaeckel (1999), p. 16.</ref> Among other measures, he ordered the construction of a pest house outside the city walls, the Berlin [[Charité]].<ref name=Jaeckel16/> 

While the plague eventually spared Berlin,<ref>Jaeckel (1999), p. 18.</ref> it raged in the northeastern regions of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], affecting the [[New March]] (Neumark) in 1710<ref>Schwartz (1901), pp. 53-79.</ref> and the [[Uckermark]], where [[Prenzlau]] was infected on 3 August 1710.<ref name=Goese165>Göse (2009), p. 165.</ref> There, the Prussian military enforced a quarantine and nailed up houses where infected people lived.<ref name=Goese165/> By January 1711, 665 people had died of the plague in Prenzlau and were buried on the city walls, and the quarantine was lifted on 10 August 1711.<ref name=Goese165/>

===Pomerania===

In August 1709, the plague arrived in the small [[Swedish Pomerania]]n town of [[Szczecin-Dąbie|(Alt-)Damm]] (now Dąbie) on the eastern bank of the [[Oder]] river, rapidly killing 500 inhabitants.<ref name=Wieden13>bei der Wieden (1999), p. 13.</ref> [[Stettin]] (now Szczecin), the capital city of Swedish Pomerania located on the opposite bank of the river, reacted by isolating the town with a guarded cordon sanitaire.<ref name=Thiede782>Thiede (1849), p. 782.</ref> Precautions taken in Stettin since the arrival of the plague in Danzig included restrictions for travellers, especially soldiers' families returning from Swedish-occupied Poland after the lost [[Battle of Poltava]] (8 July 1709), and a ban on fruits in the town's markets, since fruits were believed to transmit the disease.<ref name=Thiede781782>Thiede (1849), pp. 781–782.</ref> According to Zapnik (2006), the returning soldiers' wives who had contact with the plague-stricken areas around Poznan were most likely the transmitters of the plague to Pomerania.<ref name=Zapnik228>Zapnik (2008), p. 228.</ref> After the outbreak in Damm, the mail route connecting Stettin with [[Stargard Szczeciński|Stargard]] in the adjacent [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|Prussian province of Pomerania]] via Damm was relocated to [[Podjuchy|Podejuch]].<ref name=Thiede782/> Despite the precautions, the plague broke out in [[Warszewo, Szczecin|Warsow]], just north of Stettin, and by the end of September also inside Stettin's walls, transmitted by a local woman who had provided food to her son in Damm.<ref name=Thiede782/> As in Danzig (see above), the city council downplayed the plague cases to not impair Stettin's trade, but also set up a health commission and pest houses and hired personnel to deal with the infected.<ref name=Thiede782/>

The situation was aggravated in October 1709, when the Swedish army corps commanded by the Swedish Pomeranian [[Ernst Detlev von Krassow]] entered Pomerania. Krassow's corps, together with units of the Polish king [[Stanisław Leszczyński|Stanislaw I]], had failed to reinforce the army of king [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in [[Poltava]] as their eastward advance was blocked by Russian and Polish-Lithuanian forces near [[Lemberg]] (Lviv, Lwow).<ref>Englund (2002), pp. 65–66.</ref> When Charles was defeated at Poltava, many Polish-Lithuanian magnates switched from supporting Stanislaw I to supporting [[Augustus the Strong]], and under pursuit by Russian and Saxon forces, Krassow's corps retreated westward through plague-stricken Poland, taking with them the abandoned Polish king as well as his court and wife.<ref name=Thiede782>Thiede (1849), p. 782.</ref> Against the will of the Prussian king, whose troops were occupied in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], they crossed through the Prussian [[New March]] and Prussian Pomerania to reach Damm in Swedish Pomerania with the main army and the Swedish border near [[Wollin]], [[Gollnow]] and [[Greiffenhagen]] with smaller units on 21 October.<ref>Schöning (1837), pp. 46–107, esp. pp. 68ff.</ref> Krassow, who on his march was followed and monitored by Prussian officials, denied having infected soldiers in his corps when confronted with suspicions.<ref>Schöning (1837), pp. 68ff, esp. p. 91.</ref> In a meeting with Prussian official Scheden, he justified his choice to march through infected Damm and probably infected Gollnow by responding that Gollnow was not infected at all, and that the situation in Damm would be dealt with by setting up a military corridor through the town separating the army from the inhabitants; Horn from Krassow's corps added reports that in Damm, after the death of 500 people, none of the remaining 400 inhabitants had died for three weeks.<ref>Schöning (1837), p. 96.</ref> 

Contrary to Krassow's assurances, part of his corps was indeed infected with the plague, and the retreat from the infected Polish territories was carried out in disorder.<ref name=Zapnik228/> According to Zapnik (2006), "hordes of unrestrained soldateska, without adequate supplies and driven by fear of pursuit by their adversaries, behaved in a way more resembling their treatment of enemy territory when they had entered Swedish Pomerania."<ref name=Zapnik228/>

In addition to Damm, and Stettin, where 2,000 people died, the plague from 1709 to 1710 ravaged [[Pasewalk]], killing 67% of its inhabitants, [[Anklam]], and [[Kammin]] in Swedish Pomerania and [[Belgard]] in Prussian Pomerania.<ref name=Wieden13/> From 1710 to 1711 the plague afflicted [[Stralsund]], [[Altentreptow]], [[Wolgast]] which lost 40% of its inhabitants, and [[Wollin (town)|Wollin]], all in Swedish Pomerania,<ref name=Wieden13/> as well as Stargard and [[Bahn]] in Prussian Pomerania and [[Prenzlau]] across the border with [[Brandenburg]] (all in 1710).<ref name=Wieden12>bei der Wieden (1999), p. 12.</ref> In 1711, the plague spread to [[Greifswald]].<ref name=Wieden13/>

===Lithuania, Livonia, Estonia===

In the years 1710 and 1711, half of the Lithuanian population of about 190,000 died.<ref name=Kroll138/> The main Lithuanian city, [[Vilnius]] (Vilna, Wilno), suffered from the plague from 1709 to 1713.<ref name=Frandsen20/> Between 23,000 and 33,700 people died in the city in 1709 and 1710; that number continued to rise in the following three years, when many of the starving from the Lithuanian countryside, which was ravaged by hunger and other diseases, took refuge within its walls.<ref name=Frandsen20/>

In [[Swedish Estonia]] and [[Swedish Livonia]] [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|(both of which capitulated to the Russian tsar in 1710)]], the death toll between 1709 and 1711 was up to 75% of the population.<ref name=Kroll138/> The largest city there was [[Riga]], guarded by a garrison of 12,000, which after the [[Battle of Poltava]] was targeted by the forces of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under [[Boris Sheremetev]].<ref name=Frandsen41>Frandsen (2009), p. 41.</ref> A siege was raised by November 1709; however, when the plague broke out in the city in May 1710, it soon spread from the defendants to the Russian siege forces, causing the latter to retreat behind a cordon sanitaire.<ref name=Frandsen41/> When the plague spread to Swedish [[Dünamünde]] upstream on the [[Düna]] (Dvina) river, thwarting Riga's defendants' hopes for relief, and plague and hunger became so widespread in the city<ref name=Frandsen41/> that only 1,500 men of the garrison were still alive,<ref name=Frandsen43>Frandsen (2009), p. 43.</ref> on 5 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) / 15 July they surrendered the city to Sheremetev, who reported to the tsar 60,000 deaths in Riga and 10,000 deaths among his own forces.<ref name=Frandsen41/> While Frandsen (2009) dismisses the number for Riga as "most likely a heavy exaggeration"<ref name=Frandsen41/> and instead gives a rough estimate of 20,000 deaths by the end of the plague in October,<ref name=Frandsen43/> Sheremetev's number of Russian plague deaths seem to be "closer to the truth."<ref name=Frandsen41/> Dünamünde surrendered on 9 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) / 19 August, when only some officers and 64 healthy and ~500 sick ordinary soldiers were left.<ref name=Frandsen41/> 

The contemporaries believed that the plague in Riga continued because, when the Russian forces lifted the siege, the influx of fresh air swirled and further distributed the plague's [[Miasma theory|bad air]] throughout the city.<ref name=Frandsen43/> Some Russian measures, however, really contributed to the spread of the plague: Sheremetev allowed 114 Swedish government officials to leave for Dünamünde and from there for [[Stockholm]] with all their families and households, taking the plague with them;<ref name=Frandsen43/> also captured sick soldiers were sent to the isle of [[Ösel]] (Øsel, Saaremaa) off the Estonian coast, while the healthy were integrated into Sheremetev's corps.<ref name=Frandsen41/> Refugees from Dünamünde also carried the plague to Ösel, where the fortress of [[Ahrensburg]] was depopulated by the disease.<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 49.</ref>

The primary city of Swedish Estonia, [[Reval]] (Tallinn), was approached by a Russian force of 5,000 commanded by Bauer in August 1710, and due to a decision by the local officials and nobles, capitulated on 30 September without actually being attacked.<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 60–61.</ref> Behind its walls was a population of ~20,000 people in August, composed of the regular inhabitants, soldiers, refugees and the inhabitants of the surrounding villages, which had been demolished by the defendants on 18 August.<ref name=Frandsen61>Frandsen (2009), p. 61.</ref> By mid-December, about 15,000 of them had died of the plague, and the number of inhabitants was reduced to 1,990 inside the walls and 200 in the adjacent villages.<ref name=Frandsen62>Frandsen (2009), p. 62.</ref> The rest had either fled elsewhere, or in the case of the surviving Swedish troops and some citizens, had been allowed to leave by ship after the surrender,<ref name=Frandsen62/> carrying the plague to [[Finland]].<ref name=Frandsen61/>

===Finland, Gotland and Central Sweden===

From Livonia and Estonia, refugees brought the plague to Central Sweden and [[Finland]], at that time still an integral part of Sweden.<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 80; Engström (1994), p. 38.</ref> In June 1710, most probably via a ship from [[Pernau]], the plague arrived in [[Stockholm]], where the health commission (''Collegium Medicum'') until 29 August denied that it was indeed the plague, despite [[Bubonic plague|buboes]] being visible on the bodies of victims from the ship and in the town.<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 66–67.</ref> The plague raged in Stockholm until 1711, affecting primarily women (45.3% of the dead) and children (38.7% of the dead) in the poorer quarters outside the [[Gamla Stan|Old Town]].<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 67–68.</ref> Of Stockholm's approximately 55,000, inhabitants, about 22,000 did not survive the plague.<ref name=Frandsen68>Frandsen (2009), p. 68.</ref> 

From Stockholm, the plague in August<ref name=Persson21>Persson (2011), p. 21.</ref> and September 1710 spread to various other places in [[Uppland]], including [[Uppsala]] and [[Enköping]],<ref name=Frandsen68/> and to [[Södermanland]].<ref name=Persson21/> The court was evacuated to [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]] in August, the [[riksrådet]] to [[Arboga]] in September.<ref name=Persson21/> While in Uppland the disease seemingly faded out in the winter, it continued, though with less intensity, to ravage the Uppland countryside throughout the whole year of 1711, infecting for instance [[Värmdö Municipality|Värmdö]], [[Tillinge]] and [[Danmark Church|Danmark parish]].<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 68–69.</ref> From Uppland, the plague spread southward. [[Jönköping]] lost 31% of its inhabitants in 1710 and 1711.<ref name=Svahn>Svahn (retrieved 2012): [http://www.jkpglm.se/arkeologi/projekt/diplomaten/fordjupning12.html Pesten i Jönköping.]</ref> Besides "bad air" ([[Miasma theory|miasma]]), animals were believed to transmit the disease, and people were forbidden to keep domestic animals inside the built-up areas and ordered to kill stray pigs.<ref name=Svahn/> 

In September 1710, ships from [[Reval]] (Tallinn) carried the plague across the [[Gulf of Finland]] to [[Helsingfors]] (Helsinki), where it killed 1,185 inhabitants and refugees<ref name=Vuorinen55>Vuorinen (2007), p. 55.</ref> (two thirds of the population),<ref name=Engstroem38>Engström (1994), p. 38.</ref> and [[Borgå]] (Porvoo), where 652 people from in and around the town died.<ref name=Vuorinen55/> [[Ekenäs, Finland|Ekenäs]] (Tammisaari) and [[Åbo]] (Turku), then the largest town on the Finnish coast, with a population of 6,000, were also infected in September 1710.<ref name=Vuorinen55/> 2,000 inhabitants and refugees died of the plague in Åbo by January 1711.<ref name=Vuorinen55/> The plague then spread northwards and between 1710 and 1711 infected the towns of [[Uusikaupunki|Nystad]] (Uusikaupunki), [[Raumo]] (Rauma), [[Pori|Björneborg]] (Pori), [[Nådendal]] (Naantali), [[Jakobstad]] (Pietarsaari), [[Gamlakarleby]] (Kokkola) and [[Uleåborg]] (Oulo) as well as an abundance of rural communities<ref name=Vuorinen55/> up to a line between Uleåborg and [[Kajaani|Cajana]] (Kajana, Kajaani).<ref name=Engstroem38/> As the actual cause of the plague was unknown, counter-measures included flight, dissection of buboes and the lighting of huge fires to reduce the air's humidity, which was thought to reduce the chance of being affected by the plague's "bad air."<ref name=Engstroem38/>

The island of [[Gotland]] was also affected by the plague from 1710 to 1712.<ref name=Bohn83>Bohn (1989), p. 83.</ref> In its port town of [[Visby]], the plague claimed more than 450 deaths, which was about one fifth of its population.<ref name=Bohn83/>

===Zealand===

Already in 1708, the Danish ''Politi- och Kommercekollegium'' proposed shielding the Danish islands with a marine cordon sanitaire, with dedicated ports for inspection of incoming ships from the Baltic Sea and a quarantine station on [[Saltholm]], a small island in the [[Öresund|Sound]] between [[Copenhagen]] on [[Zealand]] (Sjælland) and [[Malmö]] in [[Scania]].<ref name=Frandsen72>Frandsen (2009), p. 72.</ref> These measures were not implemented immediately, as the plague had not yet reached the Baltic coast.<ref name=Frandsen72/> On 16 and 19 August 1709, however, the king ordered the implementation of a revised plan, and a quarantine station was built on Saltholm for goods and crews of ships coming to Denmark from the infected ports of [[Danzig]] and [[Königsberg]],<ref name=Frandsen7476>Frandsen (2009), p. 74-76.</ref> while their ships were meanwhile cleansed in [[Christianshavn]]; Dutch traders sailing from infected ports to the [[North Sea]] were to pay the [[Sound Dues]] on a special boat off the coast at [[Helsingør]].<ref name=Frandsen79>Frandsen (2009), p. 79.</ref> When the plague did not arrive in Denmark, though, Saltholm effectively fell out of use by 3 July 1710, when only three people were left in the station.<ref name=Frandsen79/> The main problem then was rather the lost [[Battle of Helsingborg]] and the aggressive type of [[typhus]] that the retreating Danish soldiers carried to Zealand from Scania.<ref name=Frandsen80>Frandsen (2009), p. 80.</ref>

When in the course of the Russian conquest of Livonia refugees carried the plague to Finland and Central Sweden, and on the southern shore of the Baltic the plague had arrived in [[Stralsund]], the worried council of [[Lübeck]] sent alerting letters to the Danish government, which after a discussion lasting from 21 October to 7/8 November resulted in a government decision to renew the quarantine requirement.<ref name=Frandsen80/> Saltholm was to be manned and equipped again, and the quarantine requirement was extended to ships from other infected ports.<ref name=Frandsen80/>

It is unclear whether at that time the plague had already arrived in Zealand's northeastern port of [[Helsingør]] (Elsinore), where the Sound Dues were collected from entering ships<ref name=Frandsen107>Frandsen (2009), p. 107.</ref> and where a suspicious series of deaths was reported by the local health commission, allegedly starting with the death in the town on 1 October 1710 of a Dutch passenger arriving from Stockholm.<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 135–138, Persson (2001), pp. 167–168.</ref> According to Persson (2001), it is "difficult to determine whether their cases have actually been a matter of plague, even if the progress in my eyes seems very suspicious;"<ref name=Persson168>Persson (2001), p. 168: ''"Det är därför svårt att avgöra om det i deras fall verkligen har rört sig om pest, även om förloppet i mina ögon verkar mycket suspekt."''</ref> while Frandsen (2009) says that "I will risk my neck and postulate that the disease in Elsinore in the autumn of 1710 was not the plague but (as the barbers indicate) a form of typhus or spotted fever."<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 138</ref> 

There are however no doubts concerning the outbreak of the plague in late November 1710 in the small village of [[Lappen]] just north of Helsingør, populated by fishermen, ferrymen and nautical pilots.<ref name=Persson168/> The first death attributed to the plague was that of a fisherman's daughter on 14 November;<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 140, 151.</ref> the peak of the plague in Lappen was reached already on 23 December, and while it faded out there in January 1711, it had already spread to or continued in neighboring Helsingør.<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 151.</ref> More than 1,800 people died in Helsingør in 1711, or roughly two thirds of its ~3,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Frandsen92>Frandsen (2009), p. 92.</ref>

Despite the precautions, the plague ultimatively spread from Helsingør to [[Copenhagen]],<ref name=Frandsen82>Frandsen (2009), p. 82.</ref> where from June to November 1711, between 12,000 and 23,000 people died out of a population of ~60,000.<ref name=Kroll&GabinskyKopenhagen>Kroll&Gabinsky (retrieved 2012): [https://www.phf.uni-rostock.de/imd/Forschung/HomeMare2/Seuchenzug/Staedte/Kopenhagen.html Kopenhagen.]</ref> Only on 19 September did the king decree that people from Zealand must not go to other Danish regions without a special passport; Zealand indeed remained the only Danish region with cases of the plague, except for Holstein (see below).<ref name=Frandsen475>Frandsen (2009), p. 475.</ref>

===Scania and Blekinge===

In [[Scania]] (Skåne), the plague arrived on 20 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]])/ 30 November 1710, when an infected [[Västanå]] boatman returned home from the navy.<ref name=Frandsen469>Frandsen (2009), p. 469</ref> Scania had not yet fully recovered from the [[Scanian War]] when its population was further weakened by a [[measles]] epidemic in 1706, a crop failure and the outbreak of [[smallpox]] in 1708–1709, an invasion of the Danish army in 1709, the expulsion of this army after the [[battle of Helsingborg]], followed by conscriptions into the Swedish army and an outbreak of [[typhus]] in 1710.<ref name=Frandsen469/> While Scania was protected from an infection from the north by a cordon sanitaire between it and [[Småland]], the plague came by sea<ref name=Frandsen470>Frandsen (2009), p. 470</ref> and made landfall not only in Västanå, but also in January 1711 in [[Domsten]] in [[Allerum]] parish, where the locals had ignored the ban on contact with their relatives and friends on the Danish side of the [[Öresund|Sound]], most notably in the infected area around [[Helsingør]] (Elsinore); the third starting point for the plague in Scania was [[Ystad]], where on 19 June an infected soldier arrived from [[Swedish Pomerania]].<ref name=Frandsen469/> The plague remained in Scania until 1713, probably 1714.<ref name=Frandsen470/>

In [[Blekinge]], the plague arrived in August 1710 by means of army movements from and to [[Karlskrona]], the central Swedish naval base.<ref name=Persson21/> By the beginning of 1712, about 15,000 soldiers and civilians had died not only in Karlskrona, but also in [[Karlshamn]] and other localities in Blekinge.<ref>Persson (2011), pp. 3, 21–22.</ref>

===Bremen, Bremen-Verden, Hamburg and Holstein===

At the time of the [[Great Northern War]], the northwest of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a patchwork with the [[Dominions of Sweden|Swedish dominion]] of [[Bremen-Verden]] located between the largely autonomous cities of [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]], bordered to the south by the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]], whose [[prince-elector]] [[George I of Great Britain|George Louis]] became king of [[Great Britain]] in 1714, and to the north by the [[Duchy of Holstein]], divided into [[Holstein-Glückstadt]], ruled by the Danish king, and [[Holstein-Gottorp]], whose duke [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Charles Frederick]], a cousin and ally of [[Charles XII of Sweden]], resided in [[Stockholm]] while Danish forces had occupied his share of the duchy only disturbed by [[Magnus Stenbock|Stenbock]]'s march [[Battle of Gadebusch|from Wakenstädt]] to [[Siege of Tönning| Tønning]] in 1713.<ref>For Gottorp and Stenbock, cf. Frandsen (2009), p. 475.</ref> Hamburg and Bremen were crowded with refugees of war, and Bremen in addition was suffering from a [[smallpox]] epidemic that had caused the deaths of 1,390 children in 1711.<ref name=Frandsen483>Frandsen (2009), p. 483.</ref> 

From Copenhagen,<ref name=Winkle4>Winkle (1983), p. 4.</ref> the plague had infected several places in Holstein,<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 476, Winkle (1983, p. 4.</ref> and while it is unclear whether Danish ships first brought it to [[Friedrichsort]], [[Rendsburg]] or [[Laboe]], and whether [[Schleswig]] and [[Flensburg]] were infected separately,<ref>Ulbricht (2004), pp. 271–272.</ref> it is established that it was the Danish army that brought the plague to Holstein.<ref name=Frandsen475/> In addition to the ports, infected towns included [[Itzehoe]], [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Kropp]] and [[Glückstadt]],<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 476</ref> in [[Kiel]], the plague was limited to the castle and spared the town.<ref name=Frandsen475/> The plague also broke out in neighboring Bremen-Verden, whose capital, [[Stade]], became infected<ref>Frandsen (2009), pp. 476, 483; Winkle (1983), p. 4.</ref> by early July 1712 and on 7 September capitulated to the Danish forces who had entered Bremen-Verden on 31 July.<ref name=Frandsen483/> The plague, as in formerly Swedish Livonia and Estonia, was a main reason for the defendants' surrender.<ref name=Frandsen483/> 

In the spring and summer of 1712, the plague also broke out in [[Gröpelingen]] on Bremish territory.<ref name=Frandsen483/> The city council downplayed the plague cases in order not to impair trade, but set up a health commission and a pest house for quarantine measures.<ref name=Frandsen483/> Isolation of the infected did not prevent the plague from spreading into Bremen, but reduced the resulting deaths, which in 1712 were "only" 56 in Gröpelingen, which had a population of 360, and 12 in Bremen, which had a population of 28,000.<ref name=Frandsen484>Frandsen (2009), p. 484.</ref> However, the plague returned to Bremen in 1713, killing another 180 people,<ref name=Frandsen484/> 

[[File:Plague doctors' beak shaped mask.png|thumb|100px|Beak shaped mask, as worn by Hamburg's [[plague doctor]] Majus]]

Hamburg was hit much more severely. When the plague had reached [[Pinneberg]] and [[Rellingen]] just north of the Hamburg territory in the summer of 1712,<ref name=Winkle5/> Hamburg restricted travel to the town, which the Danish king used as a pretext to encircle Hamburg with his forces<ref name=Winkle5>Winkle (1983), p. 5.</ref> and confiscate Hamburg vessels on the River [[Elbe]], demanding 500,000 [[thaler]]s<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 480; Ulbricht (2004), p. 300; Winkle (1983), p. 5: "300,000" thalers.</ref> (later reduced to 246,000 thalers)<ref>Winkle (1983), p. 6; Frandsen (2009), p. 480: ''"a quarter of a million."''</ref> to make up for this alleged discrimination against his subjects in Altona.<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 480; Ulbricht (2004), p. 300; Winkle (1983), p. 5.</ref> 12,000 Danish soldiers were moved before Hamburg's gates.<ref name=Winkle5/> When the plague broke out in Hamburg less than three weeks later, it was carried there from the Danish troops by a prostitute from Hamburg's ''Gerkenshof'' lane, where out of 53 people 35 fell ill and 18 died.<ref>Frandsen (2009), p. 480; Winkle (1983), pp. 5–6.</ref> The lane was blocked and isolated;<ref name=fw6>Frandsen (2009), p. 480; Winkle (1983), p. 6.</ref> however, the quarantine could not prevent the disease from spreading through the densely built-up neighborhoods.<ref name=Winkle6>Winkle (1983), p. 6.</ref> Among the dead was the [[plague doctor]] Majus, who belonged to those physicians [[Plague doctor costume|who wore a beak-shaped mask]] containing a vinegar-soaked sponge to protect him against the [[Miasma theory|miasma]].<ref name=Winkle6/> In December, the plague faded out.<ref name=fw6/>

In January 1713, Stenbock's Swedish army marched through Hamburg and burned down the neighboring town of Altona,<ref name=fw7>Frandsen (2009), p. 480; Winkle (1983), p. 7.</ref> which in contrast to Hamburg had refused to pay a contribution.<ref name=Frandsen480>Frandsen (2009), p. 480.</ref> In Altona, the plague had killed 1,000 people, among them 300 Jews, while Hamburg remained free of the plague until July and did not take in refugees from Altona.<ref name=Winkle7>Winkle (1983), p. 7.</ref> Just a week after the Swedish army had marched through Hamburg, the Russian army led by [[Peter the Great]] entered the town.<ref name=Frandsen480/> According to Frandsen (2009), the tsar "frolicked in Hamburg while his troops plundered the suburbs."<ref name=Frandsen480/>

When in August 1713 the plague broke out again,<ref name=Frandsen480/> it was much more severe than what Hamburg's inhabitants had experienced in 1712,<ref name=fw7/> and the meanwhile returned Danish army established a cordon sanitaire around the city.<ref name=fw8>Frandsen (2009), p. 480; Winkle (1983), p. 8.</ref> The cordon was supervised by Major von Ingversleben, who had dealt with the plague in Helsingør, and effectively prevented the plague from spreading to Holstein again.<ref name=Frandsen480/> When the plague finally faded out in Hamburg in March 1714, ~10,000 people had died of the disease.<ref name=Frandsen480/>

==Habsburg Monarchy and Bavaria==

From Poland, there had been three incursions of the plague into [[Silesia]] (then belonging to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]) in 1708: first into [[Miasteczko Śląskie|Georgenberg]] (Miasteczko), transmitted by a Cracow wagoner but successfully contained; then into [[Olesno|Rosenberg]] (Olesno), where it killed 860 inhabitants out of 1,700;<ref name=Lorinser437>Lorinser (1837), p. 437</ref> and also into two villages near [[Militsch]] (Milicz), from where it spread into the nearby lands of [[Syców|Wartenberg]] (Syców).<ref name=Lorinser438>Lorinser (1837), p. 438</ref> After the Swedish defeat [[Battle of Poltava|at Poltava]] in 1709, refugees from Poland including part of the Swedish-Polish corps of Joseph [[Potocki family|Potocki]] (called "Kiowski") crossed into the Silesian borderlands, but also their Russian pursuers.<ref name=Lorinser438/> This resulted in the infection of 25 villages in the [[Oels]] (Oleśnica) and Militsch area, and while the plague seemed to have faded out by February 1710, it struck again and even more severe from spring 1710 to winter 1711, killing more than 3,000 inhabitants of Oels and many villagers.<ref name=Lorinser438/> In 1712, the plague crossed into Silesia for a last time from Polish [[Zduny]], infecting the village of [[Luzin]]{{dn|date=November 2012}} near Oels and killing 14 people before it vanished in the beginning of 1713.<ref name=Lorinser438/> Contemporary to the plague, there was also a [[cattle plague]] in Silesia.<ref name=Lorinser438/>

The plague also spread to other territories of the Habsburg monarchy, though it was not involved in the Great Northern War. Territories affected in 1713 were [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] (where 37,000 died in [[Prague]]),<ref name=Helleiner60>Helleiner (1967), p. 60</ref> and [[Austria]],<ref name=HelleinerLisorner>Helleiner (1967), p. 60; Lorinser (1837), p. 437.</ref> and the plague also struck [[Moravia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].<ref name=Lorinser437/>

From the Habsburg territories, the plague crossed into the [[Electorate of Bavaria]], infecting in 1713 also the [[Free Imperial City|Free Imperial Cities]] of [[Free Imperial City of Nuremberg]] and [[Regensburg|Ratisbon]]<ref name=Lorinser437/> (Regensburg, then seat of the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|Perpetual Diet]]).
