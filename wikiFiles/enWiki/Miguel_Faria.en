Faria has studied [[Soviet communism]] and the [[Cold War]] and has written articles and reviewed books detailing many of the crimes committed by former Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] and his henchmen. Most recently in a historic and medical article published in ''Surgical Neurology International'' entitled [http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/article.asp?issn=2152-7806;year=2011;volume=2;issue=1;spage=161;epage=161;aulast=Faria “Stalin’s Mysterious Death,”] Faria cited compelling evidence that the Russian dictator was poisoned, eliminated by members of his inner circle, including [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and others, who feared for their own survival. He continues to closely follow the evolving democratic process in Russia today.<ref name=RefAusman>{{cite web|last=Ausman|first=JI|title=Editor's note on Miguel Faria's editorial on the Russian elections|url=http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/article.asp?issn=2152-7806;year=2012;volume=3;issue=1;spage=28;epage=28;aulast=Faria|publisher=Surg Neurol Int 2012;3:28|accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>

Faria was appointed by HHS Secretary [[Tommy Thompson]] to serve on the Injury Research Grant Review Committee (later renamed the Initial Review Group [IRG]) of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]].<ref name=RefHeartland>{{cite web|title=Faria Appointed to CDC Committee|url=http://www.heartland.org/publications/health%20care/article/11354/Faria_Appointed_to_CDC_Committee.html|publisher=Health Care News staff (2003 1 1)|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>  He served on that committee from 2002-2005. The IRG reviews grants seeking public funding for scientific and technical merit in the area of [http://www.cdc.gov/injury/ injury prevention and control].

His appointment to the CDC committee by the [[George W. Bush]] Administration was of great interest to public health because during the 1990s, Faria was involved in the gun control debate regarding the CDC's [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control]] (NCIPC).<ref>Hendrick B, Rochell A.

In March 1990, Faria traveled to El Salvador as part of a fact-finding mission sponsored by [[Accuracy in Media|Accuracy In Media (AIM)]], an organization headed at that time by the late [[Reed Irvine]] and Joseph Goulden. Faria agreed with AIM that the American media coverage of news from El Salvador was biased against the conservative government and favored the [[FMLN|Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)]] insurgents. During this trip to El Salvador, Faria visited hospitals and orphanages. He found that while neighboring Sandinista Nicaragua directed its efforts almost solely for war, the government of El Salvador, despite the ongoing war against the communist rebels of the FMLN, directed much of its resources toward the welfare of its citizens in health and education.<ref name=RefMaley>{{cite news|last=Maley|first=D|title=Doctor just back from El Salvador cites misconceptions about the war|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=Macon Telegraph and News|date=March 12, 1990}}</ref> After his return to the United States, Faria, who was then serving as Chief-of-Staff at HCA Coliseum Medical Centers in Macon, Georgia, convinced Dr. Thomas Frist Jr., CEO of [http://hcahealthcare.com/ Hospital Corporation of America (HCA)], to send humanitarian assistance to El Salvador, which received the assistance with gratitude.<ref name=RefIrvine>{{cite journal|last=Irvine|first=R|title=Notes from the editor's cuff: Two AIM members who have not forgotten the victims|journal=AIM Report|date=December-A 1990|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=RefSmith>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=S|title=Medical equipment from U.S. brightens Christmas in El Salvador|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=The Macon Telegraph|date=December 25, 1990, p. 1B}}</ref><ref name=RefCorson>{{cite news|last=Corson|first=E|title=Macon MD gets help for El Salvador wounded|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=The Macon Telegraph|date=January 2, 1991, p. 4A}}</ref>

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that public policy is dictated by sound scientific principles and not by premature assertions or tainted by politics or ideology.<ref name=RefData /> Faria left AAPS in 2002 to pursue other interests.<ref name=RefTribute>{{cite journal|title=A Tribute to Dr. Miguel Faria.|journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons 2003;8(1):3|url=http://www.jpands.org/vol8no1/blaylock.pdf|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=Blaylock RL}}</ref>

From 2004-2010, Faria served on the Editorial Board of ''Surgical Neurology'', an international journal of neurosurgery, formerly the Official International Journal of the Neurosurgical Societies of Belgium, Brazil, China, Romania, Russia, and Taiwan. ''[http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com Surgical Neurology International]'' (''SNI''), its successor publication, is also headed by James I. Ausman, M.D., Editor-in-Chief.

A police informant attempted to trap and implicate the elder Faria in collaborating with the anticommunist rebels fighting in the so-called [[War against the Bandits]]. Their escape was successful, despite the inquiries and pursuit of the G2 police, and the tale of their escape through several Caribbean islands is also narrated in Faria's book.<ref name=RefSolera>{{cite web|title=Book Review of Cuba in Revolution– Escape from a Lost Paradise.
