__NOTOC__
The '''Australian Measles Control Campaign''' was initiated in August 1998 as part of the [[World Health Organisation]]'s global [[Measles]] eradication program, and in response to major epidemics in [[Australia]] throughout 1994/95, together with a report predicting another impending measles epidemic in Australia. The campaign vaccinated 1.78 million children, making it the largest national vaccination campaign conducted in Australia since the introduction of [[poliomyelitis]] vaccination in 1956.

The campaign was promoted using the slogan '''''Let's Work Together to Beat Measles'''''<ref name=Beat>{{Citation

==The Campaign==
Following the World Health Organization's adoption of a 2010 target date for Global Measles eradication and the notation that a single dose vaccination strategy was ineffective, the Federal Health Department began investigating the options for a measles eradication campaign in Australia. In 1996 and 1997, [[Serology|seroserveys]] were conducted in [[South Australia]] and [[New South Wales]] to assess the current levels of measles immunity. Results indicated that there were "probably enough susceptible children in the South Australian population to support a measles epidemic". In November 1997, a workshop of experts was formed to discuss the logistical, funding and surveillance issues of a potential measles elimination campaign. The group concluded that the 2nd dose of [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] should be brought forward from 12 years to 4 years (in line with WHO recommendations), and that a school-based campaign be implemented.<ref name=Beat/> Three groups would be targeted for vaccination:
* Primary School children(5-12yrs): This group would be offered vaccination at school-based clinics, to be provided by two [[Registered Nurse]]s per school.
* Pre-school children (1-4yrs): Letters would be sent to the parents of all children who were overdue for their 1st dose of MMR, encouraging them to attend their GP for vaccination.
* High-School children (12-18yrs): A letter would be sent to all parents encouraging them to ensure their children had received two doses of MMR.

===Objectives===

* Cease measles-related morbidity and mortality, by interrupting indigenous transmission of measles
* Prevent reintroduction of measles until global eradication is achieved, by maintaining uniformly low levels of population susceptibility

===Statistics===
[[File:Graphs measles Australia 1991-2009.jpg|thumb|Measles morbidity in Australia, 1991-2009]]
* 1.7 million primary-school aged children vaccinated, representing 96% of children in this age group.<ref name=Beat />
* 800,000 pre-school children vaccinated.<ref name=Beat />
* 89 total adverse events ''(33% of which were [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]])'' representing 5.24 total adverse events per 100,000 doses.<ref name=Beat />
* Prevented an estimated 17,500 cases of measles.<ref name=Beat />
* Prevented an estimated 8 measles-related fatalities.<ref name=Beat />
* Total cost of the campaign was A$30,841,356.<ref name=Beat />

===Results===

* Increase in measles immunity for 1-18 year-olds from 85% to 90%, and 6-12 year-olds (the target age group) from 84% to 96% (Assessed by [[Serology|seroservey]]).<ref name=Beat /><ref name=Results>{{Cite journal

==Criticisms of the Campaign==
Anti-vaccination lobby group, the [[Australian Vaccination Network]] attacked the program both prior to commencement and as it progressed, asking their members to ''"Do anything and everything you can to ensure that this vaccination campaign does not take place"''.<ref>{{Citation

In response to the AVN's campaign, the then Federal Health Minister Dr Michael Wooldridge issued a media release which was critical of the group, writing:
:''"I am deeply concerned that media organisations risk giving credibility to the crackpot views of the AVN by publishing, without question, their untrue and deceitful claims. Ultimately, young children who are particularly vulnerable to measles could suffer if their parents were influenced by the anti-science, irrational views of the AVN."''<ref>{{Cite press release
