Most of the company's growth came in 2008 when it doubled in size; Between 2005 and 2010 revenue increased 3,400%.<ref name=globeandmail/> As a Canadian startup, the company received [[venture capital]] [[subsidy|subsidies]] from the [[Canada|Canadian government]] in addition to private investments.
