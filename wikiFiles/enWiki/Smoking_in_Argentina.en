'''Smoking in Argentina''' accounts for 15% of total tobacco consumption in [[Latin America]]. As of 2010, there is no nation-wide [[smoking ban|smoke-free law]], but there are a number of smoking restrictions in place in different jurisdictions, and a nationwide [[government of Argentina|governmental]] campaign against tobacco smoking and [[tobacco advertising|advertising]]. 

The Ministry of Health estimates 33.5% of the adult population of Argentina smokes, and 30% start smoking before 11 years of age;<ref>{{es icon}} Ministry of Health. [http://www.msal.gov.ar/htm/site_tabaco/index.asp National Program on Tobacco Control]</ref> tobacco causes more than 100 deaths every day in Argentina (40,000 per year, 6,000 due to secondhand smoke), and the cost of the treatment of tobacco-related diseases amounts to 6020 million [[Argentine peso]]s ($1324 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) per year, 15.5% of the total public expenditure on [[health care]]. The government collects 3500 million pesos per year in taxes on cigarettes.

==Law==
National Law 23344, passed on 29 August 1986, established restrictions on advertising and promotion of tobacco, and dictated that [[cigarette]] packs must include a legend warning that ''Smoking is harmful to health'', but did not include sanctions against violations of the law;<ref>{{es icon}} [http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/dependencias/cdrogadiccion/ley23344.htm Law 23344] — ''Ley de limitación de las publicidades sobre cigarrillos y obligatoriedad de inscripción de envases''</ref>  these were added later, and then partially vetoed.

==WHO Framework Convention==
In September 2003 Argentina signed the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], though ratification was delayed by two years. Analysts blame [[tobacco industry in Argentina|tobacco industry]] interests for this delay, as with previous failures in implementing serious anti-smoking policies.<ref>{{cite paper|author=Ernesto M.

==Legislative deadlock==
{{As of|2006}}, a proposal to prohibit smoking in all public and enclosed spaces, sent by the Executive to the National Congress in August 2005, was awaiting consideration. Legislative lobbying from the tobacco industry proposed an alternative, weaker law, championed by [[Jujuy Province]] Senator Liliana Fellner, who called herself "the voice of the [tobacco] producers" (Jujuy is one the seven tobacco-producing provinces in Argentina).<ref>{{es icon}} Página/12. 18 September 2006. [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-73193-2006-09-18.html ''Una guerra legislativa que levanta humo'']</ref>

==Public sentiment==
A nationwide telephone survey published in August 2006 showed overwhelming support of the population for laws that establish "smoke-free spaces" in public spaces such as offices, factories, shopping malls and banks (93.4% overall support, 85% among smokers), and that completely forbid smoking in schools, universities and hospitals (97%). More than three quarters among the surveyed (including almost two thirds of the smokers) also supported smoking bans for bars and restaurants.<ref>{{es icon}} Clarín. 24 August 2006.

==Provincial and municipal laws on smoking==
In 2003, according to national sources, 75% of the [[provinces of Argentina|Argentine provinces]] had some form of smoke-free legislation. Either in addition to or in the absence of provincial laws, many [[municipality|municipalities]] have local regulations to the same effect. Fines might be established for trespassers (tobacco companies, businesses and private individuals). The actual application of this legislation varies considerably.

* In [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] it is forbidden to smoke in enclosed public spaces (offices, restaurants) and to sell tobacco to minors. ''(Provincial Law 12432)'' <ref>{{es icon}} La Capital. 10 November 2005.
