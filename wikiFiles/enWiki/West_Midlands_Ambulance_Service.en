The '''West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (WMAS)''' is the second-largest ambulance service in the UK. It is the authority responsible for providing NHS [[ambulance]] services in [[Herefordshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Warwickshire]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] and [[Worcestershire]]. 

It is one of 12 [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|Ambulance Trusts]] providing England with [[Emergency medical service]]s, and is part of the [[National Health Service]], receiving direct government funding for its role.  There is no charge to patients for use of the service

WMAS is one of the highest performing ambulance services in England and was one of only two to exceed all of its national performance targets in 2006-07. WMAS employs around 4,500 staff and is supported by about 1,000 volunteers, over 63 sites, and makes over 450,000 emergency responses every year.<ref>[http://www.wmas.nhs.uk/AboutUs/FactsFigures/tabid/62/Default.aspx West Midlands Ambulance Service: Facts & Figures]</ref>

==History==

The trust was formed on July 1, 2006, following the merger of the Hereford & Worcester Ambulance Service NHS Trust, Coventry & Warwickshire Ambulance NHS Trust, and WMAS and Shropshire services.<ref name="healthcarecommission">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/yourlocalhealthservices/nhsa-zbyorganisationname.cfm?widCall1=customWidgets.content_view_1&cit_id=4049|title=Health Care Commission: WMAS|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>  

On October 1, 2007, the service merged with [[Staffordshire Ambulance Service]] NHS Trust.<ref name="healthcarecommission"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/7021533.stm|title=Midlands ambulance trusts merge |date=2007-10-01|accessdate=2008-03-28|work=BBC News}}</ref>

West Midlands Ambulance Service became a Foundation Trust on 1 January 2013.

==EOC Reconfiguration==

Following the merger of the trusts, WMAS inherited a number of standalone control rooms. This resulted in 5 EOCs spread across the region operating independently using varying levels of technology at the following sites:<ref>[http://www.wmas.nhs.uk/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=PDQKq6tY0ng%3d&tabid=158&mid=739 West Midlands Control Room Option Appraisal (10/10/2007)]</ref>
* Millennium Point, [[Brierley Hill]]
* Tollgate Drive, Stafford
* Abbey Foregate, Shrewsbury
* Bransford, Worcester - closed in December 2007
* Dale St, Leamington Spa

On 28 November 2007, the Trust agreed to go ahead with proposals for the reconfiguration of its Emergency Operations Centres, despite vocal protests from the public.
WMAS now only operates from 2 EOCs based at:
Millenium Point, Brierley Hill (Trust HQ)
Tollgate Drive, Stafford

The trust also operates a virtual EOC so waiting calls at either of the Trusts 2 EOCs can be answered by either EOC even if the call isn't designated to that control, increasing the speed response vehicles can be dispatched

==Air Ambulances==

There is an air ambulance charity serving the WMAS service community, called the [[Midlands Air Ambulance]]. 

The Midlands Air Ambulance has three daylight air ambulance helicopters covering the {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2}} of the Midlands region, based at [[RAF Cosford]] (nr [[Wolverhampton]]), [[Tattenhill Airport]] and at [[Strensham services]].<ref name="report">[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts%5CEnds63%5C0001057063_AC_20060930_E_C.PDF County Air Ambulance Trust Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 September 2006]</ref>

==Resources==

The trust has over 400 vehicles, including patient transport services vehicles, rapid response vehicles, motorcycle response units, and of course ambulance crews.

===Voluntary Aid Societies===
In times of emergency, WMAS also requests assistance from voluntary ambulance providers, such as [[St John Ambulance in England|St John Ambulance]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/latest-news/news-archive/news-stories-from-2007/july/flooding-update/shropshire.aspx|title=Shropshire's response to the flooding|date=2007-07|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> St John Ambulance (SJA) also provides 'A&E Support' crews at times when there is a high level of staff absence or there is an unusually high call volume. This arrangement sees SJA crews attending Emergency or Non-Emergency calls. SJA crews may treat and transport certain categories of patient, although they are expected to ask for further assistance for more serious patients.

===BASICS-affiliated charities===

West Midlands Ambulance Service are supported by several BASICS-affiliated charities, who provide volunteer doctors and nurses to support the regular ambulance service staff at more serious incidents.

*On some evenings and weekends, support for front-line crews is provided by the [[West Midlands CARE Team]]. The [[West Midlands CARE Team|CARE Team]] is a volunteer group of [[British Association for Immediate Care|BASICS]] doctors and nurses, conveyed in a specially equipped fast response car by a paramedic officer to provide advanced medical care at the scene of an incident.

*In Herefordshire and Worcestershire, the [[Mercia Accident Rescue Service]] ([[Mercia Accident Rescue Service|MARS]]) is available to supplement and assist WMAS crews.

*North Staffordshire BASICS provide similar support in the north of the WMAS region.
