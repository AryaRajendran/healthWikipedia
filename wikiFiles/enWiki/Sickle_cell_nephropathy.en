'''Sickle cell nephropathy''' is a type of [[nephropathy]] associated with [[sickle cell disease]], it causes [[renal]] complications as a result of sickling of [[red blood cells]] in the [[microvasculature]]. The [[hypertonic]] and relatively [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] environment of the [[renal medulla]], coupled with the slow [[blood]] flow in the [[vasa recta]], favors sickling of red blood cells, with resultant local [[infarction]] ([[papillary necrosis]]). Functional [[renal tubules|tubule]] defects in patients with sickle cell disease are likely the result of partial [[ischemic injury]] to the [[renal tubules]].

Also the sickle cell disease in young patients is characterized by renal [[hyperperfusion]], [[glomerular]] [[hypertrophy]], and [[hyperfiltration]]. Many of these individuals eventually develop a [[glomerulopathy]] leading to glomerular [[proteinuria]] (present in as many as 30%) and, in some, the [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Co-inheritance of [[Deletion (genetics)|microdeletions]] in the -[[globin]] [[gene]] ( [[thalassemia]]) appear to protect against the development of [[nephropathy]] and are associated with lower [[mean arterial pressure]] and less [[proteinuria]].

Mild [[azotemia]] and [[hyperuricemia]] can also develop. Advanced renal failure and uremia occur in 10% of cases. [[Pathologic]] examination reveals the typical lesion of "[[hyperfiltration nephropathy]]" namely, [[focal segmental glomerular sclerosis]]. This finding has led to the suggestion that [[anemia]]-induced hyperfiltration in [[childhood]] is the principal cause of the [[adult]] glomerulopathy. [[Nephron]] loss secondary to [[ischemic]] injury also contributes to the development of [[azotemia]] in these patients.

In addition to the glomerulopathy described above, renal complications of sickle cell disease include [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[infarcts]] leading to loss of function, persistent [[hematuria]], and [[perinephric]] [[hematomas]]. [[Renal papilla|Papillary]] [[infarcts]], demonstrable radiographically in 50% of patients with sickle trait, lead to an increased risk of [[bacterial]] [[infection]] in the [[scarred]] renal tissues and functional tubule abnormalities. Painless gross hematuria occurs with a higher frequency in sickle [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] than in [[sickle cell disease]] and likely results from infarctive episodes in the renal medulla. Functional tubule abnormalities such as [[diabetes insipidus|nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]] result from marked reduction in vasa recta blood flow, combined with ischemic tubule injury. This concentrating defect places these patients at increased risk of [[dehydration]] and, hence, sickling crises. The concentrating defect also occurs in individuals with sickle trait. Other tubule defects involve [[potassium]] and [[hydrogen]] ion [[excretion]], occasionally leading to [[hyperkalemic]] [[metabolic acidosis]] and a defect in [[uric acid]] excretion which, combined with increased [[purine]] synthesis in the [[bone marrow]], results in [[hyperuricemia]].

==Treatment==
Management of sickle nephropathy is not separate from that of overall patient management. In addition, however, the use of [[ACE inhibitors]] has been associated with improvement of the hyperfiltration glomerulopathy. Three-year [[Medical grafting|graft]] and patient survival in [[renal transplant]] recipients with sickle nephropathy is diminished as compared to those with other causes of [[end-stage renal disease]].<ref name="isbn0-07-147693-8">{{cite book |author=Fauci, Anthony S. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine / editors, Anthony S.
