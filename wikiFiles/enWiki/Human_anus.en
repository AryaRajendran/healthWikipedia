Two [[sphincter]]s control the exit of [[feces]] from the body during an act of [[defecation]], which is the primary function of the anus. These are the [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal anal sphincter]] and the [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external anal sphincter]], which are circular [[muscle]]s that normally maintain constriction of the orifice and which relaxes as required by normal physiological functioning. The inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer is voluntary.

With [[anal sex]], the anus can play a role in [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Attitudes towards anal sex vary and it is illegal in some countries.<ref name="Anal Sex">{{cite web |title=Anal Sex|publisher=Health.discovery.com|accessdate=2010-04-23|url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/analsex.html}}</ref> The anus is often considered a [[taboo]] part of the body,<ref name="Anal Sex"/> and it is known by a large number of usually [[vulgar]] [[slang]] terms. The anus is also the site of potential infections and other conditions, including [[cancer]]{{fact|date=January 2013}}. The traditional polite synonym for anus was [[Wiktionary:fundament|fundament]], though this [[euphemism]] is rarely heard now that medical terms are widely acceptable.

== Defecation ==
{{main|Defecation}}

Intra-rectal pressure builds as the [[rectum]] fills with feces, pushing the feces against the walls of the [[anal canal]]. Contractions of abdominal and pelvic floor muscles can create intra-abdominal pressure which further increases intra-rectal pressure. The [[internal anal sphincter]] (an involuntary muscle) responds to the pressure by relaxing, thus allowing the feces to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as feces are pushed into the anal canal and [[peristalsis|peristaltic waves]] push the feces out of the rectum. Relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters allows the feces to exit from the anus, finally, as the [[levator ani]] muscles pull the anus up over the exiting feces.

To prevent diseases of the anus{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} and to promote general hygiene, humans often clean the exterior of the anus after emptying the bowels. A rinse with water from a [[bidet]] or a wipe with [[toilet paper]] are often used for this purpose, though [[anal cleansing]] practices vary greatly between cultures.

==Puberty==

During [[puberty]], as testosterone triggers [[androgenic hair]] growth on the body, pubic hair begins to appear around the anus. Although initially sparse, it fills out by the end of puberty, if not earlier. However, in some ethnicities, androgenic hair is less common.

== Sexuality ==
{{main|Anal sex}}
The anus has a relatively high concentration of [[Nerve|nerve ending]]s and is an [[erogenous zone]], which can make anal intercourse pleasurable for both the insertive partner and the receptive partner. [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychosexual development]], for example, described an [[anal stage]], hypothesizing that toddlers derive pleasure from retaining and expelling feces. This is the source of the term "[[Anal retentive|anal-retentive]]" and the derived, [[derogatory]] vulgarism "anal".

In addition to nerve endings, pleasure from anal intercourse occurs due to the shared wall between the anus and the [[prostate]] for males and [[vagina]]/[[G-Spot]] for females. This allows for indirect stimulation of the G-Spot or [[Clitoris|clitoral]] legs in women, and prostate in men.<ref name="Www.goaskalice">{{cite web |title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=September 27, 2002 (Last Updated/Reviewed on March 28, 2008)|accessdate=April 21, 2010|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html}}</ref><ref name="Answer">{{cite book|authors =Barry R.

Anal intercourse is sometimes referred to as [[sodomy]] or [[buggery]], and is considered [[taboo]] in a number of legal systems. It has been, and in some [[jurisdiction]]s continues to be, a crime carrying severe punishment.<ref name="Anal Sex"/>

==Health==
Hygiene is important for good anal health. Washing with a mild soap and water will keep the anus clean. Harsh soaps or wiping vigorously with toilet paper can irritate the skin around the anus, making it itchy or sore. [[Pinworm]]s are sometimes the source of [[Pruritus ani|anal itching]].

Care should be taken not to strip the anus of natural oils that keep the skin around the opening supple and elastic.

Penetration with a penis or [[sex toy]] can irritate or tear the inside of the anus. Lubrication is often recommended to ease penetration. The risk of injury to the anal sphincter should be a concern. Similarly if the anus is torn, this can occasionally cause a [[anal fistula|fistula]] formation which can not only cause fecal leaking, but also can be very difficult to treat.

Sphincter exercise can improve the tone of the outer sphincter muscle.<ref>[http://www.continence-foundation.org.uk/symptoms-and-treatments/bowel.php How the healthy bowel works] Continence Foundation.org</ref>

==Cosmetics==
Shaving, trimming, [[Hair removal|depilatory]] (hair removal), or [[Brazilian waxing]] can clear the [[perineum]] of hair.

[[Anal bleaching]] is a process in which the anus and perineum, which may darken after puberty depending on individual genetics, is lightened for a more youthful appearance.

True [[anal piercing]] is rare because it may interfere with the function of the anus. However, surface piercings of the perineum are easier to care for and much more common.

== Pathology ==
{{unsourced|date=October 2012}}
Diseases of the anus include [[anal cancer]], [[abscess]], [[wart]]s, [[anal fistula|fistula]], [[anal fissure]], [[itch]]ing and [[hemorrhoid]]. The anus is also a frequent site of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s. These benefit from medical intervention.

[[Birth defects]] of the anus include [[stenosis]] and [[Imperforate anus|imperforation]]. These benefit from surgical intervention.

Damaged [[anal sphincter]] ([[patulous anus]] in more severe cases) — caused by careless or sometimes necessarily sacrificial surgery in the [[Perineum|perineal]] region{{cn|date=October 2012}} or by rough/abrupt penetration in [[anal sex]]{{cn|date=October 2012}} — can lead to [[flatus]]{{cn|date=October 2012}} and/or [[fecal incontinence]],{{cn|date=October 2012}} chronic [[constipation]]{{cn|date=October 2012}} and, ultimately, [[megacolon]].{{cn|date=October 2012}}

In [[psychology]] the [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ian term [[anal fixation]] is used.
