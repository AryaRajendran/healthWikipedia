Born in [[Omaha]], Nebraska., Dr. Edward J. Hill was educated in the public schools of Vicksburg, Mississippi and received both his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] and [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degrees from the [[University of Mississippi]]. He completed his internship while serving four years as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy, in addition to serving as a general medical officer in a naval destroyer group.
 
A board-certified family physician, Dr. Hill began his professional career in the rural Mississippi Delta where he practiced for 27 years. In addition to his full-service family practice, Dr. Hill developed and directed a local maternal child health program that resulted in lowering the fetal mortality rate from one of the highest in the United States to below the national average, where it remained. Due to his wealth of medical practice experience and recognition as a role model for young doctors, Dr. Hill was asked in January 1995 to become the director of the Family Practice Residency Program at North Mississippi Medical Center, which is the nationâ€™s largest rural hospital. Having stepped down from the directorship in July 2001, he remains on the faculty full-time and has an active practice.

Dr. Hill was elected president of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) in June 2004 and began his one-year term as president on June 2005.

==Tenure as AMA president==

In a speech entitled "Understanding, Advocacy, Leadership: The AMA Perspective on LGBT Health," [[Edward Hill, MD (US)|Edward Hill, M.D.]] became the first president of the [[American Medical Association|AMA]] to address the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]].  
{{quotation|I know that [[Gay and lesbian medical association|GLMA]] members and [[:Category:LGBT physicians|LGBT physicians]] have been treated unfairly by the AMA in the past. There is simply no excuse for discriminatory actions or exclusions based on sexual orientation or gender identity -- none. First, [[Gay and lesbian medical association|GLMA]] has opened [the AMA's] eyes to the diverse needs of LGBT patients, and second -- and just as important -- GLMA has told patients that they have the right to expect a health care system filled with openness, fairness and equality."<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/15741.html AMA (GLBT) News release from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>|[[Edward Hill, MD (US)|Dr. Edward Hill, M.D.]], president [[American Medical Association]]}}
His speech is considered by some as an historic turning point in the policy of the AMA's towards LGBT physicians after the events at [[New York Medical College]] during the tenure of the previous AMA president [[John Nelson (physician)|Dr. John Nelson]].

Dr. Hill was succeeded as AMA president by William G. Plested III, M.D.
