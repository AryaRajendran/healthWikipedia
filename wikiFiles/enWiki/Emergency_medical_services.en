'''Emergency medical services''' (abbreviated to the [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] '''EMS''' in some countries) are a type of [[emergency service]] dedicated to providing out-of-hospital [[Acute (medicine)|acute medical care]], transport to definitive care, and other medical transport to patients with illnesses and injuries which prevent the patient from transporting themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is EMS?|publisher=NHTSA|url=http://www.ems.gov/portal/site/ems/menuitem.5149822b03938f65a8de25f076ac8789/?vgnextoid=9990f44e90578110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD|accessdate=3008-08-09}}</ref> 

Emergency medical services may also be locally known as a first aid squad,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longhillnj.org/firstaid/firstaid.main.html|title=Long Hill Township First Aid Squad|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> emergency squad,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencysquad.org/|title=Hennepin County Emergency Squad|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> [[rescue squad]],<ref>{{cite web|title=South Plainfield Rescue Squad|url=http://www.sprescuesquad.com/|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> ambulance, squad<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottingham Ambulance Squad|url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/nas/|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> ambulance service,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishambulance.com/ |title=Scottish Ambulance Service|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> ambulance corps,<ref>{{cite web|title=Valhalla Volunteer Ambulance Corps|url=http://members.aol.com/oreilly7/vvac/|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> or life squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sardinialifesquad.com/ |title=Sardinia Life Squad|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

The goal of most emergency medical services is to either provide treatment to those in need of urgent medical care, with the goal of satisfactorily treating the presenting conditions, or arranging for timely removal of the [[patient]] to the next point of definitive care. This is most likely an [[emergency department]] at a [[hospital]]. The term emergency medical service evolved to reflect a change from a simple system of ambulances providing only transportation, to a system in which actual medical care is given on scene and during transport. In some developing regions, the term is not used, or may be used inaccurately, since the service in question does not provide treatment to the patients, but only the provision of transport to the [[point of care]].<ref name=motorbike>{{cite news|publisher=Transport News Network|date=2006-07-04|url=http://www.tnn.co.uk/WorldwideNews/plonearticle.2006-07-04.2967165399|title=Motorcycle Ambulance Trailer Project Gets Off The Ground With MAN ERF UK|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref>

In most places in the world, the EMS is summoned by members of the public (or other emergency services, businesses, or authorities) via an [[emergency telephone number]] which puts them in contact with a control facility, which will then dispatch a suitable resource to deal with the situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/pdfdocs/112surv-2001.pdf/ |title=EU document on European adoption of 112 emergency number|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

In some parts of the world, the emergency medical service also encompasses the role of moving patients from one medical facility to an alternative one; usually to facilitate the provision of a higher level or more specialised field of care but also to transfer patients from a specialized facility to a local hospital or nursing home when they no longer require the services of that specialized hospital, such as following successful [[cardiac catheterization]] due to a [[heart attack]]. In such services, the EMS is not summoned by members of the public but by clinical professionals (e.g. physicians or nurses) in the referring facility. Specialized hospitals that provide higher levels of care may include services such as [[neonatal intensive care]] (NICU),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crouse.org/services/children/neonatal./ |title=Crouse-Irving NICU|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> pediatric intensive care (PICU), state regional burn centres,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stronghealth.com/services/burntrauma/burncenter.cfm/ |title=Strong Memorial Burn Center|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> specialized care for spinal injury and/or [[neurosurgery]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.averaprayerline.net/pdf/amck/Neurosciences%20Institute.pdf/ |title=Avera Neurosciences Institute|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> regional [[stroke]] centers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/ems/stroke/stroke.htm/ |title= NYS DOH Regional Stroke Centers|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> specialized [[cardiac]] care<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathlabdigest.com/article/7257/ |title=Cath Labs|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/GPs+healthcare+professionals/Clinical+services/Cardiac+services+%28Heart+Hospital%29/|title=NHS Heart Hospital|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> ([[cardiac catherization]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4491/ |title=AHA Cath Lab Definition|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> and specialized/regional [[Physical trauma|trauma]] care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/shocktrauma/ |title=Maryland Shock Trauma|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref>

In some jurisdictions, EMS units may handle [[technical rescue]] operations such as [[extrication]], water rescue, and [[search and rescue]].<ref>{{cite web|title=EMS Special Operations|url=http://www.colonie.org/ems/#anchor45252|publisher=Town of Colonie EMS|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Training and [[professional certification|qualification]] levels for members and employees of emergency medical services vary widely throughout the world. In some systems, members may be present who are qualified only to drive the ambulance, with no medical training.<ref name=motorbike/> In contrast, most systems have personnel who retain at least basic [[first aid]] certifications, such as [[Basic Life Support]] (BLS). Additionally many EMS systems are staffed with [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS) personnel, including [[paramedic]]s, [[nurse]]s, or, less commonly, [[physician]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

{{Main|History of the ambulance}}

Emergency care in the field has been rendered in different forms since the beginning of recorded history. The [[New Testament]] contains the parable of the Good Samaritan, where a man who was beaten is cared for by a Samaritan. Luke 10:34 (NIV) - "He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him." Also during the Middle Ages, the [[Knights Hospitaller]] were known for rendering assistance to wounded soldiers in the battlefield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=52749|title=Knights Hspitaller's|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

The first use of the ambulance as a specialized vehicle, in battle came about with the ''ambulances volantes'' designed by [[Dominique Jean Larrey]] (1766–1842), [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s chief physician.<ref name=fly1>{{cite journal |author=Skandalakis PN, Lainas P, Zoras O, Skandalakis JE, Mirilas P |title='To afford the wounded speedy assistance': Dominique Jean Larrey and Napoleon |journal=World Journal of Surgery |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1392–9 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16850154 |doi=10.1007/s00268-005-0436-8}}</ref><ref name=fly2>{{cite journal|url=http://napoleonic-literature.com/Flying_Ambulance.htm|title=The Revolutionary Flying Ambulance of Napoleon's Surgeon|last=Ortiz|first=Captain Jose M|date=October–December 1998|pages=17–25|volume=8}}</ref> Larrey was present at the battle of Spires, between the [[France|French]] and [[Prussia]]ns, and was distressed by the fact that wounded soldiers were not picked up by the numerous ambulances (which Napoleon required to be stationed two and half miles back from the scene of battle) until after hostilities had ceased, and set about developing a new ambulance system.<ref name=fly1/><ref name=fly2/><ref name=Ambulance>{{cite book |author=Barkley, Katherine |title=The ambulance: the story of emergency transportation of sick and wounded through the centuries |publisher=Exposition Press |location=New York |year=1978 |pages= |isbn=0-682-48983-2 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  Having decided against using the Norman system of horse litters, he settled on two- or four-wheeled [[horse]]-drawn wagons, which were used to transport fallen soldiers from the (active) battlefield ''after'' they had received early treatment in the field.<ref name=fly2/>  These 'flying ambulances' were first used by Napoleon's Army of the Rhine is 1793. Larrey subsequently developed similar services for Napoleon's other armies, and adapted his ambulances to the conditions, including developing a litter which could be carried by a [[camel]] for a campaign in [[Egypt]].<ref name=fly2/>

In civilian ambulances, a major advance was made (which in future years would come to shape policy on hospitals and ambulances) with the introduction of a transport carriage for [[cholera]] patients in London during 1832.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2000_fall/1832_cholera.html|title=Cholera carriages|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref>  The statement on the carriage, as printed in ''[[The Times]]'', said "The curative process commences the instant the patient is put in to the carriage; time is saved which can be given to the care of the patient; the patient may be driven to the hospital so speedily that the hospitals may be less numerous and located at greater distances from each other".<ref name=Ambulance/>  This tenet of ambulances providing instant care, allowing hospitals to be spaced further apart, displays itself in modern emergency medical planning.

The first known hospital-based ambulance service operated out of Commercial Hospital, [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] (now the Cincinnati General) by 1865.<ref name=Ambulance/>  This was soon followed by other services, notably the [[New York]] service provided out of Bellevue Hospital which started in 1869 with ambulances carrying medical equipment, such as [[Splint (medicine)|splint]]s, a stomach pump, [[morphine]], and [[brandy]], reflecting contemporary medicine.

In June 1887 the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]] was established to provide first aid and ambulance services at public events in [[London]].<ref name=sja1>{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|title=St John Ambulance in the Industrial Revolution|publisher=St John Ambulance UK|accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> It was modelled on a military-style command and discipline structure.

The earliest emergency medical service was reportedly the rescue society founded by Jaromir V. Mundy, Count J. N. Wilczek, and [[Eduard Lamezan-Salins]] in [[Vienna]] after the disastrous fire at the Vienna Ring Theater in 1881. Named the "Vienna Voluntary Rescue Society," it served as a model for similar societies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas Genes |url=http://medgadget.com/archives/2005/09/disasters_and_e.html |title=Disasters and Emergency Medicine |publisher=Medgadget.com |date=2005-09-02 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

[[Image:DFVAC 1948 Cadillac Miller Meteor front passenger quarter.jpg|left|thumb|A 1948 Cadillac Meteor ambulance]]
Also in the late 19th century, the [[automobile]] was being developed, and in addition to horse-drawn models, early 20th century ambulances were powered by [[steam]], [[gasoline]], and [[electricity]], reflecting the competing automotive technologies then in existence. However, the first motorized ambulance was brought into service in the last year of the 19th century, with the [[Michael Reese Hospital]], [[Chicago]], taking delivery of the first automobile ambulance, donated by 500 prominent local businessmen, in February 1899.<ref name=Ambulance/>  This was followed in 1900 by New York city, who extolled its virtues of greater speed, more safety for the patient, faster stopping and a smoother ride. These first two automobile ambulances were electrically powered with 2&nbsp;hp motors on the rear axle.<ref name=Ambulance/>

American historians claim that the world's first component of civilian pre-hospital care on scene began in 1928, when "Julien Stanley Wise started the Roanoke Life Saving and First Aid Crew in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], Virginia, which was the first land-based rescue squad in the nation."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Canadian historians dispute this with the city of [[Toronto]] claiming "The first formal training for ambulance attendants was conducted in 1892."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

During World War One, further advances were made in providing care before and during transport –  [[traction splint]]s were introduced during [[World War I]], and were found to have a positive effect on the [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] of patients with leg fractures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissrescue.ch/dossier/traction_splint/traction_splint_angl.pdf|format=PDF|title=Traction splint history|accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref>  [[Two-way radio]]s became available shortly after World War I, enabling for more efficient radio [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] of ambulances in some areas. Shortly before [[World War II]], then, a modern ambulance carried advanced medical equipment, was staffed by a [[physician]], and was dispatched by radio. In many locations, however, ambulances were [[hearse]]s - the only available vehicle that could carry a recumbent patient - and were thus frequently run by [[funeral home]]s. These vehicles, which could serve either purpose, were known as [[combination car]]s.<ref name="Kuehl">Kuehl, Alexander E. (Ed.). ''Prehospital Systems and Medical Oversight'', 3rd edition.

Prior to World War II, hospitals provided ambulance service in many large cities. With the severe manpower shortages imposed by the war effort, it became difficult for many hospitals to maintain their ambulance operations. City governments in many cases turned ambulance services over to the police or fire department. No laws required minimal training for ambulance personnel and no training programs existed beyond basic first aid. In many fire departments, assignment to ambulance duty became an unofficial form of punishment.

Advances in the 1960s, especially the development of [[CPR]] and [[defibrillation]] as the standard form of care for out-of-hospital [[cardiac arrest]], along with new [[pharmaceutical]]s, led to changes in the tasks of the ambulances.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kouwenhoven WB, Jude JR, Knickerbocker GG |title=Closed-chest cardiac massage |journal=JAMA |volume=173 |issue= |pages=1064–7 |year=1960 |month=July |pmid=14411374}}</ref>  In [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] the first experimental mobile coronary care ambulance successfully resuscitated patients using these technologies. One well-known report in the USA during that time was ''Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society''. This report is commonly known as [[The White Paper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9978&page=R1|title=Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> These studies, along with the White Paper report, placed pressure on governments to improve emergency care in general, including the care provided by ambulance services. In the USA prior to the 1970s, ambulance service was largely unregulated. While some areas ambulances were staffed by advanced first-aid-level responders, in other areas, it was common for the local undertaker, having the only transport in town in which one could lie down, to operate both the local furniture store (where he would make coffins as a sideline) and the local ambulance service. The government reports resulted in the creation of [[Standardization|standard]]s in ambulance construction concerning the internal height of the patient care area (to allow for an attendant to continue to care for the patient during transport), and the equipment (and thus weight) that an ambulance had to carry, and several other factors.

In 1971, after release of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s study, "Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society".  A progress report was published at the annual meeting, by the then president of American Association of Trauma, Sawnie R. Gaston M.D.   Dr. Gaston reported the study a "superb white paper" that "jolted and wakened the entire structure of organized medicine.  This report was the "prime mover" and made the "single greatest contribution of its kind to the improvement of emergency medical services".  Since this time a concerted effort has been undertaken to improve emergency medical care in the pre-hospital setting.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Trauma |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=195–206 |year=1971 |month=March |pmid=5545943 |doi=10.1097/00005373-197103000-00001}}</ref> Such advancements included Dr. [[R Adams Cowley]]<!--there's no period after his first initial--> creating the country's first statewide EMS program, in [[Maryland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/shocktrauma/history.html |title=History |publisher=Umm.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

== Service providers ==
[[File:Modena ambulance.jpg|thumb|A volunteer ambulance crew in [[Modena]], [[Italy]]]]

Some countries closely regulate the industry (and may require anyone working on an ambulance to be qualified to a set level), whereas others allow quite wide differences between types of operator.

*Government Ambulance Service
: Operating separately from (although alongside) the fire and police service of the area, these ambulances are funded by local, provincial or national government. In some countries, these only tend to be found in big cities, whereas in countries such as United Kingdom almost all emergency ambulances are part of a national health system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/aboutnhsservices/emergencyandurgentcareservices/pages/ambulanceservices.aspx|title=UK NHS Ambulance Service Information|accessdate=2009-11-01|publisher=NHS Direct}}</ref> In the United States, ambulance service provided by a local government are often referred to as "third service" EMS (the Fire Department, Police Department, and separate EMS forming an emergency services trio) by the employees of said service, as well as other city officials and residents.
*Fire or Police Linked Service
: In countries such as the United States, Japan, France, and parts of India; ambulances can be operated by the local fire or police service. This is particularly common in [[rural]] areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective. In some cases this can lead to an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as a [[fire apparatus|fire truck]].
*Volunteer Ambulance Service
:  Charities or non-profit companies operate ambulances, both in an emergency and patient transport function. This may be along similar lines to volunteer fire companies, providing the main service for an area, and either community or privately owned. They may be linked to a voluntary [[firefighting|fire service]], with volunteers providing both services. There are charities who focus on providing ambulances for the community, or for cover at private events (sports etc.). The [[Red Cross]] provides this service in some parts of the world on a volunteer basis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=15&cachefixer=|title=British Red Cross Voluntary Ambulance Service|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=British Red Cross}}</ref> (and in others as a Private Ambulance Service), as do other smaller organisations such as [[St John Ambulance]]<ref name=SJA2>{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do/event-first-aid-cover.aspx|title=St John Ambulance First Aid Cover for Events|publisher=St John Ambulance UK|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> and the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://195.218.114.18/orderofmalta/global/site/what-we-do.asp?id=15|title=Order of Malta Ambulance Corps|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Order of Malta Ambulance Corps}}</ref>  These volunteer ambulances may be seen providing support to the full time ambulance crews during times of emergency. In some cases the volunteer charity may employ paid members of staff alongside volunteers to operate a full time ambulance service, such in some parts of Australia, Ireland and most importantly Germany and Austria.
[[File:An ambulance in Kiev.jpg|thumb|A government ambulance service  in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]
*Private Ambulance Service
: Normal commercial companies with paid employees, but often on contract to the local or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response, where they only respond to emergencies when all of the full-time emergency ambulance crews are busy. This may mean that a government or other service provide the 'emergency' cover, whilst a private firm may be charged with 'minor injuries' such as cuts, bruises or even helping the mobility impaired if they have for example fallen and just need help to get up again, but do not need treatment. This system has the benefit of keeping emergency crews available all the time for genuine emergencies. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstaidservices.net.au|title=First Aid Services|accessdate=2009-03-31|publisher=First Aid Services}}</ref>
*Combined Emergency Service
: these are full service emergency service agencies, which may be found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They may be found in smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows to make the most of limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.
*Hospital Based Service
: Hospitals may provide their own ambulance service as a service to the community, or where ambulance care is unreliable or chargeable. Their use would be dependent on using the services of the providing hospital. Most Advanced Life Support (Paramedic) services in the United States are this type of service.
*Charity Ambulance
: This special type of ambulance is provided by a charity for the purpose of taking sick children or adults on trips or vacations away from hospitals, hospices or care homes where they are in long term care. Examples include the UK's 'Jumbulance' project.<ref name=jumbulance>{{cite web|url=http://www.jumbulance.org.uk/faq.html|title=Questions and Answers|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Jumbulance Travel Trust}}</ref>
*Company Ambulance
: Many large factories and other industrial centres, such as [[chemical plant]]s, [[oil refineries]], [[breweries]] and [[distilleries]] have ambulance services provided by employers as a means of protecting their interests and the welfare of their staff. These are often used as first response vehicles in the event of a fire or explosion.

[[Image:Star of life parts.svg|thumb|Six points on the Star of Life]]
Emergency medical services exists to fulfill the basic principles of [[first aid]], which are to Preserve Life, Prevent Further Injury, and Promote Recovery.
This common theme in [[medicine]] is demonstrated by the "star of life". The [[Star of Life]] shown here, where each of the 'arms' to the star represent one of the six points, which are used to represent the six stages of high quality pre-hospital care, which are:<ref name=emscom>{{cite web|title=Design, Origin and Meaning of the Star of Life|url=http://www.ems.gov/vgn-ext-templating/ems/sol/pages/DesignOrigin.htm|publisher=NHTSA|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref>

#Early detection &ndash; members of the public, or another agency, find the incident and understand the problem
# Early reporting &ndash; the first persons on scene make a call to the emergency medical services and provide details to enable a response to be mounted
# Early response &ndash; the first professional (EMS) rescuers arrive on scene as quickly as possible, enabling care to begin
# Good on-scene care &ndash; the emergency medical service provides appropriate and timely interventions to treat the patient at the scene of the incident
# Care in transit &ndash; the emergency medical service load the patient in to suitable transport and continue to provide appropriate medical care throughout the journey
# Transfer to definitive care &ndash; the patient is handed over to an appropriate care setting, such as the emergency department at a hospital, in to the care of physicians

[[Image:MS1 on stretcher.jpg|thumb|A patient arriving at hospital]]

Emergency Medical Service is provided by a variety of individuals, using a variety of methods. To some extent, these will be determined by country and locale, with each individual country having its own 'approach' to how EMS should be provided, and by whom. In some parts of Europe, for example, legislation insists that efforts at providing [[advanced life support]] (ALS) Mobile Intensive Care Units (MICU) services must be physician-staffed, while other permit some elements of that skill set to specially trained nurses, but have no paramedics. Elsewhere, as in North America, the UK and Australia, ALS services are performed by paramedics, but rarely with the type of direct "hands-on" physician leadership seen in Europe. Increasingly, particularly in the UK and in South Africa, the role is being provided by specially-trained paramedics who are independent practitioners in their own right. Beyond the national model of care, the type Emergency Medical Service will be determined by local jurisdictions and medical authorities, based upon the needs of the community, and the economic resources to support it.

A category of emergency medical service which is known as 'medical retrieval' or ''rendez vous MICU protocol'' in some countries (Australia, NZ, Great Britain) refers to critical care transport of patients between hospitals (as opposed to pre-hospital). Such services are a key element in regionalised systems of hospital care where intensive care services are centralised to a few specialist hospitals. An example of this is the [[Emergency Medical Retrieval Service]] in Scotland.

Generally speaking, the levels of service available will fall into one of three categories; [[Basic Life Support]] (BLS), [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS), and care by traditional healthcare professionals, meaning [[nurses]] and/or [[physicians]] working in the pre-hospital setting and even on ambulances. In some jurisdictions, a fourth level, Intermediate Life Support (ILS), which is essentially a BLS provider with a moderately expanded skill set, may be present, but this level rarely functions independently, and where it is present may replace BLS in the emergency part of the service. When this occurs, any remaining staff at the BLS level is usually relegated to the non-emergency transportation function. Job titles typically include [[Emergency Medical Technician]], [[Ambulance Technician]], or [[Paramedic]]. These ambulance care givers are generally professionals or paraprofessionals and in some countries their use is controlled through training and registration. While these job titles are protected by legislation in some countries, this protection is by no means universal, and anyone might, for example, call themselves an 'EMT' or a 'paramedic', regardless of their training, or the lack of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/emergency-medical-services-corporation|title=Great Britain EMT|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> In some jurisdictions, both technicians and paramedics may be further defined by the environment in which they operate, including such designations as 'Wilderness', 'Tactical', and so on.

=== Basic life support ===
==== First responder ====
A [[first responder]] is a person who arrives first at the scene of an incident, and whose job is to provide early critical care such as [[CPR]] or using an [[Automated external defibrillator|AED]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/FirstRsp.html/|title=Resuscitation Council UK First Responders|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, [[Certified first responder|citizen volunteers]], or may be members of other agencies such as the [[police]], [[fire department]], or [[search and rescue]] who have some medical training—commonly CPR, basic first aid, and AED use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflesueur.com/sections/police.php|title=Flesueur Police Department|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

==== Ambulance driver ====
Some jurisdictions separate the 'driver' and 'attendant' functions, employing ambulance driving staff with no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate), whose job is to drive the ambulance. While this approach persists in some countries, such as India, it is generally becoming increasingly rare. Ambulance drivers may be trained in radio communications, ambulance operations and emergency response driving skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unionems.com/categories_vol_membership.htm|title=Union EMS|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

==== Ambulance care assistant ====
[[Ambulance Care Assistant]]s (ACAs) have varying levels of training across the world. In many countries, such staff are usually only required to perform patient transport duties (which can include stretcher or wheelchair cases), rather than acute care. However, there remain both countries and individual jurisdictions in which economics will not support ALS service, and the efforts of such individuals may represent the only EMS available. Dependent on the provider (and resources available), they may be trained in first aid or extended skills such as use of an [[Automated external defibrillator|AED]], oxygen therapy, pain relief and other live-saving or [[palliative]] skills. In some services, they may also provide emergency cover when other units are not available, or when accompanied by a fully qualified technician or paramedic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=907/ |title=NHS Careers|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health-care-jobs.co.uk/index/index.php?item_id=107|title=ACA job description|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

==== Emergency medical technician ====
[[File:EMTs loading a patient.jpg|thumb|right|EMTs loading a patient into an ambulance]]
[[Emergency medical technician]]s, also known as Ambulance Technicians in the UK and EMT in the United States. In the United States, EMT is usually made up of 3 levels. EMT-B, EMT-I and EMT-Paramedic. The New Educational Standards for EMS renamed the provider levels as follows: EMR, emergency medical responder, EMT, emergency medical technician, AEMT, advanced EMT, and Paramedic. Technicians are usually able to perform a wide range of emergency care skills, such as Automated [[defibrillation]], care of spinal injuries and [[oxygen therapy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.bls.gov/oco/oco2001.htm#training|title=Dept. of Labor EMT Job Description|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/ems/pdf/srgemt.pdf|format=PDF|title=NYS EMT-B Job Description|

==== Emergency medical dispatcher ====
An emergency medical dispatcher is also called an EMD. An increasingly common addition to the EMS system is the use of highly trained dispatch personnel who can provide "pre-arrival" instructions to callers reporting medical emergencies. They use carefully structured questioning techniques and provide scripted instructions to allow callers or bystanders to begin definitive care for such critical problems as airway obstructions, bleeding, childbirth, and cardiac arrest. Even with a fast [[Emergency response time|response time]] by a first responder measured in minutes, some medical emergencies evolve in seconds. Such a system provides, in essence, a "zero response time," and can have an enormous impact on positive patient outcomes.

=== Advanced life support ===
Advanced life support is also called ALS.

==== Paramedic ====
A [[paramedic]] has a high level of prehospital medical training and usually involves key skills not performed by technicians, often including [[Intravenous therapy|cannulation]] (and with it the ability to use a range of drugs to relieve pain, correct cardiac problems, and to assist with [[endotracheal intubation]]), [[cardiac monitoring]], [[tracheal intubation]], needle decompression and other skills such as performing a [[cricothyrotomy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&pageno=1&idno=205 |title=Paramedic: Job description|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> In many countries, this is a protected title, and use of it without the relevant qualification may result in criminal prosecution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/|title=HPC - Health Professions Council - Protected titles|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> In the United States, paramedics represent the highest licensure level of prehospital emergency care.

==== Critical care paramedic ====
Recently studies have looked at new level of pre-hospital care.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paquette|first=Anthony John|title=The Feasibility of the Advanced Practice Paramedic.|url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1077&context=uchcgs_masters&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dadvanced%2520practice%2520paramedics%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D2%26ved%3D0CCUQFjAB%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.uconn.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1077%2526context%253Duchcgs_masters%26ei%3DqdOETrWmOIb20gGeyoHDDw%26usg%3DAFQjCNF-ycySaGDSUAoTsoIjTiDjVGFDiA#search=%22advanced%20practice%20paramedics%22|work=UCHC Graduate School Masters Theses 2003 - 2010|publisher=University Of Connecticut Health Center Graduate School|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Critical Care Paramedic Position Paper|url=http://www.flightparamedic.org/documents/CriticalCareParamedicPositionPaper.pdf|publisher=International Association Of Flight Paramedics|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref>  What has developed is the [[critical care paramedic]], also called an advanced practice Paramedic in some parts of [[USA]] and [[Canada]].  These providers represent a higher level of licensure above that of the DOT or respective paramedic level curriculum.<ref name=CCEMTP/> The training, permitted skills, and certification requirements vary from one jurisdiction to the next.  These providers transport critically ill or injured patients from one [[hospital]] to a receiving [[hospital]] with higher level of care (ie.. [[cardiac catheterization]], trauma services or specialized ICU services) not available at referring facility.

These Paramedics receive additional training beyond normal EMS medicine.  The Board for Critical Care Transport Certification (BCCTPC®) has developed a certification exam for flight and ground critical care paramedics <ref>{{cite web|title=Report of a National Study of the Certified Critical Care Paramedic|url=http://www.bcctpc.org/Documents/Ground%20Critical%20Care%20Summary%20Blueprint.pdf|publisher=The Board for Critical Care Transport Certification|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Board Of Critical Care Transport Paramedic|url=http://www.bcctpc.org/|publisher=The Board for Critical Care Transport Certification|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> Some educational facilities that provide this training are [[UMBC]] [[Critical Care Emergency Medical Transport Program]]<ref>{{cite web|title=CCEMTP Course|url=http://ehs.umbc.edu/CE/CCEMT-P/|publisher=University Of Maryland Baltimore County|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> or {{cite web |url= http://www.emsacademy.us/Education/CriticalCareEducation/CertifiedIntensiveCareProvider/tabid/1962/Default.aspx|title=Cleveland Clinic CICP program}}.  Individual services such as {{cite web |url= http://www.wakegov.com/ems/staff/app|title=Wake County EMS}} and {{cite web |url= http://www.medstar911.org/critical-care-transport|title=MedStar EMS}} in Fort Worth, Tx. have developed 'in-house' advanced practice paramedic providers.  These providers have a vast array of and medications to handle complex medical and trauma patients.  Examples of medication are [[Dopamine]], [[Dobutamine]], [[Propofol]], [[Blood]] and [[Blood products]] to name just a few.  Some examples of skills include, but not limited to, life support systems normally restricted to the ICU or critical care hospital setting such as [[mechanical ventilators]], [[Intra-aortic balloon pump]] (IABP) and external [[pacemaker]] monitoring.  Depending on the service medical direction, these providers are trained on placement and use of UVCs (Umbilical Venous Catheter), UACs (Umbilical Arterial Catheter), [[surgical airways]], [[central lines]], [[arterial lines]] and [[chest tubes]].

==== Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician ====
Some paramedics and EMTs, known as [[Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician]]s, utilize expanded scope of practice protocols that are operationalized when in wilderness (remote, austere, or resource-deficient) environments.  Wilderness EMS Systems (WEMS) have been developed to deliver a standard and professiona medical response to wilderness areas.  Examples include the national-level agencies such as the [[National Ski Patrol]] in the United States as well as local responding agencies.  Like traditional EMS providers, all WEMS providers must still operate under on-line or off-line medical oversight.  To assist physicians in the skills necessary to provide this oversight, the [[Wilderness Medical Society]] and the National Association of EMS Physicians jointly supported the development in 2011 of a unique "Wilderness EMS Medical Director" certification course,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hawkins, SC|title=Wilderness EMS Medical Director Course |journal=Wilderness Medicine |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=24–25 |year=2012 |month=Winter/January 2012 }}</ref> which was cited by the Journal of EMS as one of the Top 10 EMS Innovations of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Journal of EMS|title=Blazing a Trail|url=http://m.jems.com/article/administration-and-leadership/blazing-trail|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> Common procedures utilized by WEMS providers that exceed traditional EMS scope of care include joint reduction, catheterization, antibiotic administration, selective spinal immobilization, and different training and protocols involving CPR cessation and wilderness skills.  A multitude of organizations provide WEMS training, including private schools,<ref>{{cite web|title=Landmark Learning|url=http://www.landmarklearning.org|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SOLO|url=http://www.soloschools.com|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Aerie Backcountry Medicine|url=http://www.aeriemedicine.com|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wilderness Medical Associates|url=http://www.wildmed.com|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wilderness Medicine Institute of NOLS|url=http://www.nols.edu/wmi|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> non-profit organizations such as the [[Appalachian Center for Wilderness Medicine]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Appalachian Center for Wilderness Medicine|url=http://www.appwildmed.org|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> and the Wilderness EMS Institute,<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilderness EMS Institute|url=http://www.wemsi.org|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref>  military branches, community colleges and universities,<ref>{{cite web|title=Roane State Wilderness First Responder|url=http://www.roanestate.edu/webfolders/HAGEMANEA/healthSciences/2011TremontBrochure.pdf|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=University of Utah Wilderness and EMS Fellowship|url=http://www.utahhealthsciences.net/pageview.aspx?id=17053|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> EMS-college-hospital collaborations,<ref>{{cite web|title=Carolina Wilderness EMS Externship|url=http://www.blueridgehealth.org/wildems|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> and others.

==== Paramedic practitioner / Emergency care practitioner ====
In the United Kingdom and South Africa, some serving [[paramedic]]s receive additional university education to become practitioners in their own right, which gives them absolute responsibility for their clinical judgement, including the ability to autonomously prescribe medications, including drugs usually reserved for doctors, such as courses of antibiotics. An [[emergency care practitioner]] is a position sometimes referred to as a 'super paramedic' and is designed to bridge the link between ambulance care and the care of a [[general practitioner]]. ECPs are university graduates in Emergency Medical Care or qualified paramedics who have undergone further training,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swast.nhs.uk/careersandvac/careers.htm#ECP|title= South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> and are authorized to perform specialized techniques. Additionally some may prescribe medicines (from a limited list) for longer term care, such as antibiotics. With respect to a Primary Health Care setting, they are also educated in a range of Diagnostic techniques.

=== Traditional healthcare professions ===
==== Registered nurse ====
The use of registered nurses (RNs) in the pre-hospital setting is more common in countries that have a limited EMS infrastructure in place. Some European countries such as France or Italy, which do not use paramedics as we understand them, also use nurses as a means of providing ALS services. These nurses may work under the direct supervision of a physician, or, in rarer cases, independently. In some places in Europe, notably Norway, paramedics do exist, but the role of the 'ambulance nurse' continues to be developed,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Melby V, Ryan A |title=Caring for older people in prehospital emergency care: can nurses make a difference? |journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=1141–50 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16164532 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2005.01222.x}}</ref> as it is felt that nurses may bring unique skills to some situations encountered by ambulance crews. In North America, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the English-speaking world, some jurisdictions use specially trained [[Registered nurse|nurses]] for medical transport work. These are mostly air-medical personnel or critical care transport providers, often working in conjunction with a technician or paramedic or physician on emergency interfacility transports. In the United States, the most common uses of ambulance-based Registered nurses is in the Critical Care/Mobile Intensive Care transport, and in Aeromedical EMS. Such nurses are normally required by their employers (in the US) to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing registration. In [[Estonia]] 60% of ambulance teams are led by nurse. Ambulance nurses can do almost all emergency procedures and administer medicines pre-hospital such as physicians in Estonia. In the [[Netherlands]], all ambulances are staffed by a registered nurse with additional training in emergency nursing, anaesthesia or critical care, and a driver-EMT.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wulterkens D |title=EMS in the Netherlands: A Dutch Treat? |journal=Journal of Emergency Medical Services |pmid= |date=2005-12-06|url=http://m.jems.com/article/operations-protcols/ems-netherlands-dutch-treat }}</ref> In [[Sweden]], since 2005, all emergency ambulances should be staffed by at least one registered nurse since only nurses are allowed to administer drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suserud B |title=A new profession in the pre-hospital care field: the ambulance nurse |journal=Nursing in Critical Care |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=269–71 |year=2005 |month= |pmid= |date=|url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bom A |title=International EMS system Design: Sweden |journal=EMSNEWS |pmid= |date=Feb 2012|url=http://www.emsnews.com/read/featured-articles/international-ems-system-design-sweden|accessdate=2012-08-29 }}</ref> And all Advanced Life Support Ambulances are staffed at least by a registered nurse in [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2012/06/08/pdfs/BOE-A-2012-7655.pdf |title=''REAL DECRETO 836/2012, de 25 de mayo, por el que se establecen las características técnicas, el equipamiento sanitario y la dotación de personal de los vehículos de transporte sanitario por carretera''.

==== Physician ====
There are many places in Europe, most notably in France, Italy, and the German-speaking countries (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) where the model of EMS is different, and physicians take a more direct, 'hands-on' approach to pre-[[hospital]] care. In France and Italy, response to high-acuity emergency calls is physician-led, as with the French [[SMUR]] teams. [[Paramedic]]s do not exist within those systems, and most ALS is performed by physicians. In the German-speaking countries, paramedics do exist, but special physicians (called Notarzt) respond directly to high-acuity calls, supervising the paramedics ALS procedures directly. Indeed, in these countries paramedics are not typically legally permitted to practice their ALS procedures unless the physician is physically present, unless they face immediate life-threatening emergencies.<ref name=g1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/page.asp?his=0.7.47.3222 |title=Bundesärztekammer - Notfall: Notkompetenz I (German Federal Board of Physicians: Directives regarding emergency powers for Paramedics)|publisher=Bundesaerztekammer.de |accessdate=2010-07-29|language=German}}</ref> Some systems - most notably [[air ambulance]]s in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonsairambulance.com/|title=Londons Air Ambulance|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreyairambulance.co.uk/crew.asp/|title=Surrey Air Ambulance|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> will employ [[physician]]s to take the clinical lead in the ambulance; bringing a full range of additional skills such as use of medications that are beyond the paramedic skill set. The response of physicians to emergency calls is routine in many parts of Europe, but is uncommon in the UK, where physicians are generally tasked to high priority calls ona  voluntary basis.  Within the UK a sub-speciality of Pre-Hospital Care is being developed for Doctors, which would allow training programmes and consultant posts to be developed in this one area of practice.

This 'hands-on' approach is less common in the United States. While one will occasionally see a physician with an ambulance crew on an emergency call, this is much more likely to be the Medical Director or an associate, inducting newly trained paramedics, or performing routine medical quality assurance. In some jurisdictions adult or pediatric critical care transports sometimes use physicians, but generally only when it appears likely that the patient may require surgical or advanced pharmacologic intervention beyond the skills of an EMT, paramedic or nurse during transport. Physicians are leaders of medical retrieval teams in many western countries, where they may assist with the transport of a critically ill, injured, or special needs patient to a tertiary care hospital, particularly when longer transport times are involved.

==<span id="Delivery"/>Prehospital Delivery of care==
Depending on country, area within country, or clinical need, emergency medical services may be provided by one or more different types of organisation. This variation may lead to large differences in levels of care and expected scope of practice.

The most basic emergency medical services are provided as a transport operation only, simply to take patients from their location to the nearest medical treatment. This was often the case in a historical context, and is still true in the developing world, where operators as diverse as taxi drivers<ref name=motorbike/> and undertakers may operate this service.

Most developed countries now provide a government funded emergency medical service, which can be run on a national level, as is the case in the United Kingdom, where a national network of ambulance trusts operate an emergency service, paid for through central taxation, and available to anyone in need,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?printPage=1&articleId=529|title=UK NHS Ambulance Service Information|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> or can be run on a more regional model, as is the case in the United States, where individual authorities have the responsibility for providing these services.
[[Image:BFDandUVES.JPG|thumb|left|Typical scene at a local emergency room]]
Ambulance services can be stand alone organisations, but in some cases, the emergency medical service is operated by the local fire<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.emsresponder.com/print/Firehouse-Magazine---EMS-Features/Fire-Service-Based-EMS-Advocates-Ruffle-Some-Feathers/3$7713|title=Fire Service Based EMS advocates ruffle some feathers!|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> or police<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.co.nassau.ny.us/eab.htm |title=Patrol Division Nassau County Police Department |publisher=Police.co.nassau.ny.us |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> service. This is particularly common in [[rural]] areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective. This can lead, in some instances, to an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as [[fire truck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillside-il.org/departments/fire/|title=Hillside Fire Department|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westchesteroh.org/fire/faq/#ambulance|title=Why does a fire truck come to my house when I call 911 for an ambulance?|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/print/the-magazine/features/852331/our-lazy-firemen-must-make-a-radical-change.thtml|title=Our lazy firemen must make a radical change|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref>  In some locales, firefighters are the first responders to calls for emergency medical aid, with separate ambulance services providing transportation to [[hospital]]s when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Success hat-trick underlines firefighters community commitment|url=http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/text/ccm/content/your-council/news-room/press-releases/2007/2007-07/success-hat-trick-underlines-firefighters-community-commitment.en;jsessionid=asmNBB4ZCKxe|publisher=West Sussex County Council|accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2007-07-26}}</ref>

Some charities or non-profit companies also operate emergency medical services, often alongside a patient transport function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=15&cachefixer=|title=British Red Cross Voluntary Ambulance Service|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref>  These often focus on providing ambulances for the community, or for cover at private events, such as sports matches. The [[Red Cross]] provides this service in many countries across the world on a volunteer basis (and in others as a Private Ambulance Service), as do some other smaller organizations such as [[St John Ambulance]].<ref name=SJA2>{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do/event-first-aid-cover.aspx|title=St John Ambulance First Aid Cover for Events|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> and the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://195.218.114.18/orderofmalta/global/site/what-we-do.asp?id=15|title=Order of Malta Ambulance Corps|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref>  In some countries, these volunteer ambulances may be seen providing support to the full-time ambulance crews during times of emergency, or simply to help cover busy periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/latest-news/news-archive/news-stories-from-2008/january/volunteers-on-hand-for-floods.aspx|title=Volunteers on hand for flood help|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref>

There are also private ambulance companies, with paid employees, but often on contract to the local or national government. Many private companies provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent), although in some places these private services are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response, where they only respond to emergencies when all of the full-time emergency ambulance crews are busy or to respond to non-emergency home calls.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Private companies are often contracted by private clients to provide event specific cover, as is the case with voluntary EMS crews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w-a-n-t.co.uk/medical%20services.htm#medical%20cover|title=WANT Medical Service|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

Many colleges and universities, especially in the United States, maintain their own EMS organizations. These organizations operate at capacities ranging from first response to ALS transport. Campus EMS in the United States is overseen by the [[National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation]].

===<span id="Strat"/>Strategies for delivering care===
[[File:Rallye Rejvíz 2012, ZZS ZK, VW T5 Strobel (01).jpg|thumb|right|Ambulance in the [[Czech Republic]]]]
The essential decision in prehospital care is whether the patient should be immediately taken to the [[hospital]], or advanced care resources are taken to the patient where they lie. The "scoop and run" approach is exemplified by the [[MEDEVAC]] aeromedical evacuation helicopter, whereas the "stay and play" is exemplified by the French and Belgian [[SMUR emergency mobile resuscitation unit]].

The strategy developed for prehospital trauma care in North America is based on the [[Golden Hour (medicine)|Golden Hour]] theory, i.e., that a trauma victim's best chance for survival is in an [[operating room]], with the goal of having the patient in surgery within an hour of the traumatic event. This appears to be true in cases of internal [[bleeding]], especially penetrating trauma such as gunshot or stab wounds. Thus, minimal time is spent providing prehospital care (spine immobilization; "ABCs", i.e. ensure ''a''irway, ''b''reathing and ''c''irculation; external bleeding control;  [[intubation|endotracheal intubation]]) and the victim is transported as fast as possible to a [[trauma centre]].<ref>Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society, (1966), National Academy of Sciences (White Paper)</ref>

The aim in "Scoop and Run" treatment is generally to transport the patient within ten minutes of arrival, hence the birth of the phrase, "the platinum ten minutes" (in addition to the "golden hour"), now commonly used in EMT training programs. The "Scoop and Run" is a method developed to deal with [[Physical trauma|trauma]], rather than strictly medical situations (e.g. cardiac or respiratory emergencies), however, this may be changing. Increasingly, research into the management of S-T segment elevation [[myocardial infarctions]] ([[STEMI]]) occurring outside of the hospital, or even inside community hospitals without their own [[Percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]] labs, suggests that time to treatment is a clinically significant factor in heart attacks, and that trauma patients may not be the only patients for whom 'load and go' is clinically appropriate. In such conditions, the gold standard is the [[door to balloon]] time. The longer the time interval, the greater the damage to the [[myocardium]], and the poorer the long-term prognosis for the patient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nallamothu BK, Bates ER |title=Percutaneous coronary intervention versus fibrinolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction: is timing (almost) everything? |journal=The American Journal of Cardiology |volume=92 |issue=7 |pages=824–6 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14516884 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(03)00891-9}}</ref> Current research in Canada has suggested that door to balloon times are significantly lower when appropriate patients are identified by paramedics in the field, instead of the emergency room, and then transported directly to a waiting PCI lab.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bogaty P, Buller CE, Dorian P, O'Neill BJ, Armstrong PW |title=Applying the new STEMI guidelines: 1.

=== Models of care ===
Although a variety of differing [[philosophical]] approaches are used in the provision of EMS care around the world, they can generally be placed into one of two categories; one [[physician]]-led and the other led by pre-hospital specialists such as [[emergency medical technician]]s or [[paramedic]]s (which may, or may not have accompanying physician oversight). These models are typically identified by their locations of origin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German emergency medical services system |journal=Prehospital and Disaster Medicine |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=29–35; discussion 35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14694898}}</ref>

The '''Franco-German''' model is physician-led, with doctors responding directly to all major emergencies requiring more than simple [[first aid]]. In some cases in this model, such as France, paramedics, as they exist in the Anglo-American model, are not used, although the term 'paramedic' is sometimes used generically, and those with that designation have training that is similar to an U.S. EMT-B.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samu-de-france.fr/en/news/front/afficher/rescue_services_in_europe_france-ref/?id_actu=170|title=SAMU de France website|accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref>  The team's physicians and in some cases, [[nurses]], provide all medical interventions for the patient, and non-medical members of the team simply provide the driving and heavy lifting services. In other applications of this model, as in Germany, a paramedic equivalent does exist, but is sharply restricted in terms of [[scope of practice]]; often not permitted to perform [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS) procedures unless the physician is physically present, or in cases of immediate life-threatening conditions.<ref name=g1/> [[Ambulances]] in this model tend to be better equipped with more advanced medical devices, in essence, bringing the emergency department to the patient. High-speed transport to hospitals is considered, in most cases, to be unnecessarily unsafe, and the preference is to remain and provide definitive care to the patient until they are medically stable, and then accomplish transport. In this model, the physician and nurse may actually staff an ambulance along with a driver, or may staff a rapid response vehicle instead of an ambulance, providing medical support to multiple ambulances.

The second care structure, termed the '''Anglo-American''' model, utilizes pre-hospital care specialists, such as [[emergency medical technician]]s and [[paramedic]]s, to staff ambulances, which may be classified according to the varying skill levels of the crews. In this model it is rare to find a physician actually working routinely in the pre-hospital setting, although they may be utilised on complex or major injuries or illnesses.  In this system, a physicians involvement is most likely to be the provision of medical [[Regulation|oversight]] for the work of the ambulance crews, which may be accomplished in terms of off-line medical control, with [[Medical guideline|protocols]] or 'standing orders' for certain types of medical procedures or care, or on-line medical control, in which the technician must establish contact with the physician, usually at the [[hospital]], and receive direct orders for various types of medical interventions.  In some cases, such as in the UK, South Africa and Australia, a [[paramedic]] may be an autonomous health care professional, and does not require the permission of a physician to administer interventions or medications from an agreed list, and can perform roles such as suturing or prescribing medication to the patient.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4634569.stm|title=What Does a Super Paramedic Do? (BBC News website)|accessdate=2008-09-19 | date=2005-06-30}}</ref>

In this model, patients may still be treated at the scene up to the skill level of the attending crew, and subsequently transported to definitive care, but in many cases the reduced skill set of the ambulance crew and the needs of the patient indicate a shorter interval for transport of the patient than is the case in the Franco-German model.

===<span id="MD"/>Clinical governance===
Paramedics in Anglosaxon  countries normally function under the authority (medical direction) of one or more [[physicians]] charged with legally establishing the emergency medical directives for a particular region. Paramedics are credentialed and authorized by these physicians to use their own clinical judgment and diagnostic tools to identify medical emergencies and to administer the appropriate treatment, including drugs that would normally require a physician order. Credentialing may occur as the result of a State Medical Board examination (U.S.) or the [[National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians]] (U.S.). In England, and in some parts of Canada, credentialing may occur by means of a College of [[Paramedicine]].<ref>[http://www.britishparamedic.org British Paramedic Association, College of Paramedicine]</ref> In these cases, paramedics are regarded as a self-regulating health profession. The final common method of credentialing is through certification by a [[Medical Director]] and permission to practice as an extension of the Medical Director's license to practice some medical acts. The authority to practice in this semi-autonomous manner is granted in the form of standing order [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] (off-line medical control) and in some cases direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional [[emergency physician]]s, with clinical decision-making authority using standing orders or protocols.

In some parts of the world, those in the paramedical professional  role are only permitted to practise many of their advanced skills while assisting a physician who is physically present, or they face cases of immediately life-threatening emergencies.<ref name=g1/> In many other parts in the world, most notably in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, and Spain, but also in Brazil and Chile.  All [[MICU]] skills in the pre-hospital setting are performed by physicians and nurses and an On-line Permanent medical supervision is done by the SAMU. In certain other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and South Africa, paramedics may be entirely autonomous practitioners capable of prescribing medications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cooper S, Barrett B, Black S, ''et al.'' |title=The emerging role of the emergency care practitioner |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=614–8 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15333548 |pmc=1726445 |doi=10.1136/emj.2003.011247}}</ref> In other jurisdictions, such as Australia and Canada, this expanded [[scope of practice]] is under active consideration and discussion.<ref>{{cite web|last=O’Meara|first=Dr. Peter|title=Expanded-Scope Paramedic (ESP) role for rural ambulance services|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/11365/sub160.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia Productivity Commission|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref>
