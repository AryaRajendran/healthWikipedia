Two other teams existed at that time one at Louisville, Kentucky, USA and the other at the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA. In 2004 a team led by Dr. [[Maria Siemionow]] at the Cleveland Clinic became the first institution to approve this surgery.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4259538.stm BBC NEWS | Health | US plans first face transplant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There was considerable resistance to facial transplantation taking place in the UK.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1088854,00.html Surgeons warn of face transplant race | The Guardian | Guardian Unlimited<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
