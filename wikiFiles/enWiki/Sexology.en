'''Sexology''' is the interdisciplinary [[scientific method|scientific study]] of [[human sexuality]], including human sexual interests, behavior, and function.  The term does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sex, such as political analysis or social criticism.<ref name =Bullough1989/><ref name=Haeberle/>

In modern sexology, researchers apply tools from several academic fields, including [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[statistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[criminology]]. Sexologists study [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], the development of [[sexual relationship]]s, as well as the mechanics of [[sexual intercourse]]. It also documents the sexualities of special groups, such as the disabled, child development, adolescents, and the [[geriatric sexology|elderly]]. Sexologists additionally study [[sexual dysfunction]]s, disorders, and variations, including such widely varying topics as [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anorgasmia]], and [[pedophilia]].  

==Historical overview==
Sexology as it exists today, as a specific research-based scientific field, is relatively new. While there are works dedicated towards sex in antiquity, the scientific study of sexual behavior in human beings began in the 19th century.  Shifts in [[Europe]]'s national borders at that time brought into conflict laws that were sexually liberal and laws that criminalized behaviors such as homosexual activity.

Pre-Nazi Germany, under the sexually liberal [[Napoleonic code]], organized and resisted the anti-sexual, Victorian cultural influences. The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology.  Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.<ref>Goltz, Dustin (2008). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer movements. In A. Lind & S. Brzuzy (Eds.), ''Battleground: Women, gender, and sexuality, 2,'' 291. Greenwood Publishing Group, ISBN 978-0-313-34039-0</ref>  Other sexologists in the early [[gay rights]] movement included [[Ernst Burchard]] and [[Benedict Friedlaender]]. [[Ernst Grafenberg]], after whom the [[g-spot]] is named, published the initial research developing the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).  Germany's dominance in sexual behavior research ended with the Nazi regime, marked by the destruction of the ''[[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]]'' (Institute for Sexology) in Berlin.<ref name =Bullough1989/> 

After World War II, sexology experienced a renaissance, beginning in the United States.  Large scale studies of sexual behavior, sexual function, and [[sexual dysfunction]] gave rise to the development of [[sex therapy]].<ref name=Haeberle/> Post-WWII sexology in the U.S. was influenced by the influx of European refugees escaping the Nazi regime and the popularity of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey studies]]. Until that time, American sexology consisted primarily of groups working to end [[prostitution]] and to educate youth about [[sexually transmitted diseases]].<ref name =Bullough1989/>

The emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s caused a dramatic shift in sexological research efforts towards understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.<ref>Gagnon, J. (1988). Sex research and sexual conduct in the era of AIDS. ''Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 1,'' 593-601.</ref>

==Timeline of major events==
=== Ancient ===
[[sex manual|Sexual manuals]] have existed since antiquity, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], the ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'' and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]''. None of these treat sex as the subject of a formal field of scientific or medical research, however.

===Pre World-War II===
In 1837, ''De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris'' (Prostitution in the City of Paris) was published by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet. In that study, Parent-Duchatelet provided data from a sample of 3,558 registered prostitutes of Paris.  That effort has been called the first work of modern sex research.<ref name=Bullough1989>Bullough, V. L. (1989). ''The society for the scientific study of sex: A brief history.'' Mt. Vernon, IA: The Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality</ref>

In 1886, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] published ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].''  That work is considered as having established sexology as a scientific discipline.<ref name = Hoenig1977>Hoenig, J. (1977). Dramatis personae: Selected biographical sketches of 19th century pioneers in sexology. In J. Money and H. Musaph (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexology,'' (pp. 21-43). Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.</ref>

In 1897, [[Henry Havelock Ellis|Havelock Ellis]], a British sexologist, co-authored the first English medical text book on homosexuality, ''Sexual inversion'' (Das Konträre Geschlechtsgefühle).<ref>http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=276359</ref>  (The original German-languaged edition was published in 1896.)  A friend of [[Edward Carpenter]], Ellis was one of the first sexologists who did not regard homosexuality as a disease, immoral, or a crime.  He preferred the term [[sexual inversion (sexology)|inversion]] to homosexuality, and developed concepts such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], which were later adopted by Sigmund Freud.  He is regarded as having been one of the most influential scholars in opposing Victorian morality regarding sex.<ref name = Hoenig1977/>

In 1908, the first scholarly journal of the field, ''Journal of Sexology'' (Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft), began publication and was published monthly for one year. Those issues contained articles by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Wilhelm Stekel]].<ref name=Haeberle>Haeberle, E. J. (1983). ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents.'' World Association for Sexology.</ref>

In 1913, the first academic association was founded: the ''Society for Sexology''.<ref>Kewenig, W. A. (1983, May 22–27). Forward. In E. J. Haeberle, ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents'' (p. 3). World Association for Sexology.</ref>

[[Sigmund Freud]] developed a theory of sexuality. These stages of development include: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency and Genital. These stages run from infancy to puberty and onwards.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14969 Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex by Sigmund Freud - Project Gutenberg<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> based on his studies of his clients, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Otto Gross]], were disciples of Freud, but rejected by his theories because of their emphasis on the role of sexuality in the revolutionary struggle for the emancipation of mankind.

In 1919, [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] founded the ''[[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]]'' (Institute for Sexology) in [[Berlin]]. Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. The Institute and its library were destroyed by the Nazis less than three months after they took power, May 8, 1933.<ref name=Haeberle/> Hirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).<ref>{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title=  Die Transvestiten.

===Post World-War II===
[[Alfred Kinsey]] founded the [[Institute for Sex Research]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] in 1947.  This is now called the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. He wrote in his 1948 book that more was scientifically known about the sexual behavior of farm animals than of humans.<ref>p. 3 of Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., & Martin, C. E. (1948). ''Sexual behavior of the human male.'' New York and Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders.</ref>

[[Kurt Freund]] developed the [[penile plethysmograph]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1950s.  The device was designed to provide an objective measurement of [[sexual arousal]] in males, and Freund used it to help dispel a number of myths surrounding [[homosexuality]].  This tool has since been used with [[sex offenders]].<ref name="apobit">Associated Press (October 26, 1996).

[http://www.sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm Sexual Science Mentor: Dr. Kurt Freund]. ''Sexual Science'' 45.2</ref>

In 1966 and 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] released their works ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy,'' respectively.  Those volumes sold well, and they were founders of what became known as the [[Masters & Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

[[Vern Bullough]] was the most prominent historian of sexology during this era, as well as being a researcher in the field.<ref>[http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html Dr. Vern L Bullough - Publications - Vern Bullough<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===21st century===
Technological advances have permitted sexological questions to be addressed with studies using behavioral genetics,<ref>Mustanski, B.S., Dupree, M. G., Nievergelt, C., Schork, N. J., & Hamer, D. H. (2005). A genomewide linkage scan of male sexual orientation. ''Human Genetics, 116,'' 272-278.</ref> neuroimaging,<ref>Ferretti, A., et al. (2005).

Guest Editor's introduction to the BBC special section. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 36,'' 145-145.</ref>

At the start of the 21st century, the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] was the only university in the world to offer a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in sexology.<ref>Jacqueline Comte. [http://www.jcomtesexo.ca/what_is_sexology.htm What is Sexology?] Accessed 2011-07-07.</ref> As of 2012, however, other universities, such as [[Curtin University]] in Australia, have similar courses.<ref>Curtain University.
