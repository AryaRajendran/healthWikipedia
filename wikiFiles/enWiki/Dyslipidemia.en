'''Dyslipidemia''' is an abnormal amount of lipids (e.g. cholesterol and/or fat) in the blood. In developed countries, most dyslipidemias are [[hyperlipidemia]]s; that is, an elevation of lipids in the blood.  This is often due to [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and lifestyle. Prolonged elevation of [[insulin]] levels can also lead to dyslipidemia.   Likewise, increased levels of [[OGT (gene)|O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)]] may cause dyslipidemia.

==Classification==
Physicians and basic researchers classify dyslipidemias in two distinct ways:

* [[Phenotype]], or the presentation in the body (including the specific type of lipid that is increased)
* [[Etiology]], or the reason for the condition ([[genetics|genetic]], or secondary to another condition.) This classification can be problematic, because most conditions involve the intersection of genetics and lifestyle issues. However, there are a few well-defined genetic conditions that are usually easy to identify.
