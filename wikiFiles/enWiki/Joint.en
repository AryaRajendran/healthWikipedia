A '''joint''' is the location at which two or more [[bone]]s connect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4074|title=Joint definition|publisher=eMedicine Dictionary|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref> They are constructed to allow movement (except for skull bones) and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally.<ref name="isbn0-443-07168-3"/>{{pn|date=October 2012}}

==Classification==
[[Image:Gray298.png|thumb|right|Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.]]
[[Image:Illu synovial joint.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.]]
Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications. 

Terms ending in the [[suffix]] -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.

=== Structural classification (binding tissue)===
Structural classification names and divides joints according to the type of binding tissue that connects the bones to each other.<ref name="Whiting2006p40"/> There are three structural classifications of joints:<ref name="umich2010ClByTiss"/>

* [[fibrous joint]] - joined by dense regular connective tissue that is rich in collagen fibers <ref name="anatomical">Principles of Anatomy & Physiology, 12th Edition, Tortora & Derrickson, Pub: Wiley & Sons</ref>
* [[cartilaginous joint]] - joined by [[cartilage]]
* [[synovial joint]] - not directly joined - the bones have a synovial cavity and are united by the dense irregular connective tissue that forms the articular capsule that is normally associated with accessory ligaments.<ref name="anatomical"/>

===Functional classification (movement)===
Joints can also be classified functionally according to the type and degree of movement they allow:<ref name="Whiting2006p40"/><ref name="umich2010ClByMov"/>

* [[synarthrosis]] - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are [[fibrous joint]]s (e.g., skull sutures).
* [[amphiarthrosis]] - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are [[cartilaginous joint]]s (e.g., [[intervertebral disc]]s).
* [[diarthrosis]] - freely movable.<ref name="Whiting2006p40"/><ref name="umich2010ClByMov"/> All diarthrosis joints are [[synovial joint]]s (e.g., shoulder, hip, elbow, knee, etc.), and the terms "diarthrosis" and "synovial joint" are considered equivalent by [[Terminologia Anatomica]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000055678|synovial joint}}</ref> Diarthroses can in turn be classified into six groups according to the type of movement they allow: [[arthrodia]], [[enarthrosis]], [[ginglymus]], [[rotary diarthrosis]],<ref name="Morton1849p119"/><ref name="Gray1859p136"/> [[condyloid articulation]] and [[articulation by reciprocal reception]].<ref name="Gray1887p220"/>

Joints can also be classified according to the number of axes of movement they allow, into monoaxial, biaxial and multiaxial.<ref name="Platzer2008p28"/> Another classification is according to the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] allowed, and distinguished between joints with one, two or three degrees of freedom.<ref name="Platzer2008p28"/> A further classification is according to the number and shapes of the articular surfaces: flat, concave and convex surfaces.<ref name="Platzer2008p28"/> Types of articular surfaces include [[trochlear]] surfaces.<ref>Armen S Kelikian, Shahan Sarrafian [http://books.google.com/books?id=I8h6bDR0SLMC&pg=PA94 ''Sarrafian's Anatomy of the Foot and Ankle: Descriptive, Topographic, Functional''] p.94</ref>

===Biomechanical classification===
Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into ''simple'' and ''compound'', depending on the number of bones involved, and into ''complex'' and ''combination'' joints:<ref name="titleIntroductory Anatomy: Joints">{{cite web |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/chb/lectures/anatomy4.html |title=Introductory Anatomy: Joints |accessdate=2008-01-29 |work=}}</ref>
# Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (e.g. [[shoulder joint]], [[hip joint]])
# Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (e.g. [[radiocarpal joint]])
# Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an [[articular disc]] or [[meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] (e.g. [[knee|knee joint]])

===Anatomical=== <!--joint groups redirects here-->
The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:
#[[Articulations of hand]]
#[[Elbow|Elbow joints]]
#[[Wrist|Wrist joints]]
#[[Axillary articulations (disambiguation)|Axillary articulations]]
#[[Sternoclavicular joint]]s
#[[Vertebral articulation]]s
#[[Temporomandibular joint]]s
#[[Sacroiliac joint]]s
#[[Hip joint]]s
#[[Knee|Knee joint]]s
#[[Articulations of foot]]

==Joint disorders==
{{Further|Arthropathy|Arthritis}}
A joint disorder is termed an [[arthropathy]], and when involving [[inflammation]] of one or more joints the disorder is called an [[arthritis]]. Most joint disorders involve arthritis, but joint damage by external [[physical trauma]] is typically not termed arthritis.

Arthropathies are called ''polyarticular'' when involving many joints and ''monoarticular'' when involving only one single joint.

Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55. There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis, [[osteoarthritis]] (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[psoriatic arthritis]], which are [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune diseases]] in which the body is attacking itself. [[Septic arthritis]] is caused by joint [[infection]]. [[gout|Gouty arthritis]] is caused by deposition of [[uric acid]] crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate.  This form of gout is known as [[Chondrocalcinosis|pseudogout]].
