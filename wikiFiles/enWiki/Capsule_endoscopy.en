'''Capsule endoscopy''' is a way to record images of the [[digestive tract]] for use in [[medicine]].  The capsule is the size and shape of a pill and contains a tiny camera.  After a patient swallows the capsule, it takes pictures of the inside of the gastrointestinal tract.  The primary use of capsule endoscopy is to examine areas of the small intestine that cannot be seen by other types of endoscopy such as [[colonoscopy]] or [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] (EGD).  This type of examination is often done to find sources of bleeding or abdominal pain.  The procedure was approved  by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2001.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.org/gi-sct/capsuleendo.html "Capsule Endoscopy in Gastroenterology"]. Mayo Clinic. Accessed October 5, 2007.</ref>

== History ==
Invented in Israel and FDA approved in 2001.

== Uses ==
Capsule endoscopy is used to examine parts of the gastrointestinal tract that cannot be seen with other types of endoscopy.  Upper endoscopy, also called [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|EGD]],  uses a camera attached to a long flexible tube to view the esophagus, the stomach and the beginning of the first part of the small intestine called the [[duodenum]].  A [[colonoscope]], inserted through the rectum, can view the colon and the distal portion of the small intestine, the terminal [[ileum]].   Unfortunately, these two types of endoscopy cannot visualize the majority of the middle portion of the gastrointestinal tract, the small intestine.  Capsule endoscopy is useful when disease is suspected in the small intestine and can sometimes diagnose sources of occult bleeding [blood visible microscopically only] or causes of abdominal pain such as [[Crohn's disease]], or [[peptic ulcer]]s.  Capsule endoscopy can be used to diagnose problems in the small intestine, but unlike EGD or colonoscopy, cannot treat pathology that may be discovered. The capsule endoscopy can use [[bluetooth]] to transfer the captured images. A transmitted radio frequency signal can be used to accurately estimate the location of the capsule and to track it in real-time inside the body and gastrointestinal tract.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fowler/A%20Novel%20Method%20for%20Medical%20Implant%20In-Body%20Localization_Rev2.pdf|author= M.
