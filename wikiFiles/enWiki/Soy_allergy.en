'''Soy allergy''' is a type of [[food allergy]]. It is a hypersensitivity to [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary substances from [[soy]] causing an overreaction of the immune system which may lead to severe physical symptoms for millions of people.<ref>National Institutes of Health, NIAID Allergy Statistics 2005 http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/allergystat.htm</ref> The [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]] estimates soy is among the nine most common food allergens for pediatric and adult food allergy patients.<ref>“Allergy Facts and Figures,” Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=20&cont=518</ref> It is usually treated with an exclusion [[Dieting|diet]] and vigilant avoidance of foods that may be contaminated with soy ingredients.  The most severe food allergy reaction is called [[anaphylaxis]]<ref>National Report of the Expert Panel on Food Allergy Research, NIH-NIAID 2003 http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dait/PDF/june30_2003.pdf</ref> and is a [[medical emergency]] requiring immediate attention and treatment with [[Epinephrine]].

==Reactions and treatment==
Some people who are allergic to soy protein may have an extreme allergic reaction and go into [[anaphylactic shock]] (anaphylaxis). In cases of anaphylaxis, emergency medical personnel typically administer [[epinephrine]] (available as an [[autoinjector]], such as [[EpiPen]]) and an [[antihistamine]] such as Benadryl ([[diphenhydramine]]). In event of an [[allergic reaction]], the victim should see a physician or immediately go to the emergency room, as anaphylaxis can be fatal if not treated immediately.

==Diagnosis==
Soy allergy can be diagnossed by a [[Skin allergy test|prick test]] or a blood test for immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/soy-allergy/DS00970/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis "Mayo Clinic: Soy Allergy - Tests and diagnosis"], May 20, 2011, retrieved February 26th, 2013</ref>

== Food sources of soy protein ==
Many [[fast-food restaurant]]s commonly use soy protein in hamburger buns (soy flour), hamburger meat (soy protein) and [[hydrolyzed vegetable protein]] (HVP) in sauces. On their respective websites, McDonald's and Burger King list soy flour as an ingredient in their hamburger buns.<ref>[http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.categories.ingredients.index.html "McDonald's Nutrition Information and Ingredients"], August 26, 2006, retrieved September 7, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.bk.com/Nutrition/PDFs/ingredients.pdf ''Burger King USA''] (11 page PDF file) "Burger King Nutrition and Ingredients" ''Burger King Brands Inc. USA'', August, 2006, retrieved September 7, 2006</ref> U.S. Nutrition Information Multi-grain breads, doughnuts, doughnut mix and pancake mix commonly contain soy flour. Nearly all bread products available in the US now contain soy. Soy can now be found in nearly all types of foods, from meat to ice cream, to cheese, to french fries. Many foods are contaminated with soy due to being cooked in soy oil. At the Jack in the Box fast food chain for example, everything fried is cooked in a soy oil. At Baskin Robbins, over half of all ice creams offered contain soy. Canned tuna may contain vegetable broth which contains soy protein. 

Some products [for reasons having to do with national regulation of soy products] don't list soy protein or soy flour on their ingredients labels, yet they still contain soy. There are still many latent issues resolving how soy should be regulated, as well as its long term effects on human health.
Unilever Holland use soy bean oil in their peanut butter among other foods, which they state on their website concerning allergies contains no soy bean. People will have allergy reactions but the reaction may be put on peanuts rather than soy oil.

Products containing soy protein include:

*[[edamame]]
*[[miso]]
*[[natto]]
*[[shoyu sauce]]
*[[soy]] (soy albumin, soy fiber, soy flour, soy grits, soy milk, soy nuts, soy sprouts)
*[[soybean]] ([[curd]], [[:wikt:granule|granules]])
*soybean butter
*[[soy protein]] ([[concentrate]], [[isolate]])
*[[soy milk]]
*[[soy sauce]], tamari
*[[tempeh]]
*[[textured vegetable protein]] (TVP)
*[[hydrolyzed vegetable protein]] (HVP)
*[[tofu]]

The following food additives may contain soy protein:

*[[flavoring]] (including [[natural flavoring|natural]] and [[artificial flavoring|artificial]])<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.allergyadvisor.com/hidden.htm |publisher=Allergy Advisor |title=Hidden Allergens in Foods |accessdate=2011-12-27 }}</ref>
*prepared [[broth]]s, including chicken broth, vegetable broth, and [[bouillon cube]]s<ref>Staff, Cleveland Clinic. [http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/soy_allergies/hic_soy_allergy.aspx Soy Allergy]</ref>

== Dosage tolerance ==

Many people with soy allergy can tolerate small or moderate amounts of soy protein: the typical dose needed to induce an allergic response is about 100 times higher than for many other food allergens.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Christopher T.
