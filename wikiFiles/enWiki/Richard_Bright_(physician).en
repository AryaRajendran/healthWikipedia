'''Richard Bright''' (28 September 1789 &ndash; 16 December 1858) was an [[England|English]] [[physician]] and early pioneer in the research of [[Nephrology|kidney disease]]. 

He was born in [[Bristol]], [[Gloucestershire (traditional)|Gloucestershire]], the third son of Sarah and Richard Bright Sr., a wealthy merchant and banker. Bright Sr. shared his interest in science with his son, 
encouraging him to consider it as a career. In 1808, Bright Jr. joined the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study philosophy, economics and mathematics, but switched to medicine the following year. In 1810, he accompanied Sir [[Sir George Steuart Mackenzie|George Mackenzie]] on a summer expedition to [[Iceland]] where he conducted [[natural history|naturalist]] studies. Bright then continued his medical studies at [[Guy's Hospital]] in [[London]] and in September 1813 returned to [[Edinburgh]] to be granted his [[Doctor of Medicine|medical doctorate]]. His [[thesis]] was ''De erysipelate contagioso'' (''On contagious [[erysipelas]]'').

During the 1820s and 1830s Bright again worked at Guy's Hospital, teaching, practising and researching medicine. There he worked alongside two other celebrated medical pioneers, [[Thomas Addison]] and [[Thomas Hodgkin]]. His research into the causes and [[symptom]]s of kidney disease led to his identifying what became known as [[Bright's disease]]. For this, he is considered the "[[People known as the father or mother of something#B|father]] of [[nephrology]]". He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1821 <ref>{{cite web|url =http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bright%27%29|title = Library Archive|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 2012-08-24}}</ref>

Bright had a special affection for Hungary and in 1815 he lived in Festetics Castle in Keszthely, where there is a large plaque: “To the memory of the English physician scientist and traveller who was one of the pioneers in the accurate description of Lake Balaton.” 

He delivered the [[Harveian Oration]] in 1830, the [[Lumleian Lectures]] in 1837 on "Disorders of the Brain" and the [[Gulstonian lectures]] in 1833 on the "Function of the Abdominal Viscera" at the Royal College of Physicians.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati06stepuoft|page= 334|title = Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate = 2012-08-24}}</ref>

On 11 December 1858, Bright became severely ill due to complications of [[heart disease]] and was unable to recover. He died in London aged 69 and was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].

Bright had two sons. The younger also became a physician; the elder, [[James Franck Bright]], a [[historian]].
