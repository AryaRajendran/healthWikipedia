She was director of the Reformatory 1881-1883. In 1883 she went to [[Vassar College]] as professor of physiology and resident physician. She was engaged in general medical practice in [[Brooklyn, New York]], from 1886 to 1896, and then became professor of hygiene in the department of literature, science and arts, and women's dean at the University of Michigan.
