'''Toxicogenomics''' is a field of [[science]] that deals with the collection, interpretation, and storage of information about [[gene]] and [[protein]] activity within particular [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] of an [[organism]] in response to [[toxin|toxic substances]]. Toxicogenomics combines [[toxicology]] with [[genomics]] or other high throughput molecular profiling technologies such as [[transcriptomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]].<ref>The National Academies Press: Communicating Toxicogenomics Information to Nonexperts: A Workshop Summary (2005) [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11179&page=3]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Toxicogenomics: Principles and Applications |editor=Hamadeh HK, Afshari CA |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=0-471-43417-5 |author=ed. by Hisham K.

In pharmaceutical research toxicogenomics is defined as the study of the structure and function of the genome as it responds to adverse xenobiotic exposure.  It is the toxicological subdiscipline of pharmacogenomics, which is broadly defined as the study of inter-individual variations in whole-genome or candidate gene single-nucleotide polymorphism maps, haplotype markers, and alterations in gene expression that might correlate with drug responses (Lesko and Woodcock 2004, Lesko et al. 2003). Though the term toxicogenomics first appeared in the literature in 1999 (Nuwaysir et al.) it was already in common use within the pharmaceutical industry as its origin was driven by marketing strategies from vendor companies. The term is still not universal accepted, and others have offered alternative terms such as chemogenomics to describe essentially the same area (Fielden et al., 2005). 

The nature and complexity of the data (in volume and variability) demands highly developed processes of automated handling and storage. The analysis usually involves a wide array of [[bioinformatics]] and [[statistics]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mattes WB, Pettit SD, Sansone SA, Bushel PR, Waters MD |title=Database development in toxicogenomics: issues and efforts |journal=Environ.

In pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]] and [[Drug development|development]] toxicogenomics is used to study [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse]], i.e. [[toxic]], effects, of pharmaceutical [[drug]]s in defined [[Model organism|model systems]] in order to draw conclusions on the toxic risk to patients or the environment.
Both the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] currently preclude basing regulatory decision making on genomics data alone. However, they do encourage the voluntary submission of well-documented, quality genomics data. Both agencies are considering the use of submitted data on a case-by-case basis for assessment purposes (e.g., to help elucidate mechanism of action or contribute to a weight-of-evidence approach) or for populating relevant comparative databases by encouraging parallel submissions of genomics data and traditional toxicologic test results.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Corvi R, Ahr HJ, Albertini S, ''et al.'' |title=Meeting Report: Validation of Toxicogenomics-Based Test Systems: ECVAM–ICCVAM/NICEATM Considerations for Regulatory Use |journal=Environ Health Perspect. |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=420–9 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16507466 |pmc=1392237 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.8247|url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html}}</ref>
