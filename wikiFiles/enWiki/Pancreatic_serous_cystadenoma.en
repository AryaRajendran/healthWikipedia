'''Pancreatic serous cystadenoma''', also known as '''serous cystadenoma of the pancreas''' and '''serous microcystic adenoma''', a [[benign]] [[tumour]] of pancreas. It is usually found in the tail of the pancreas,<ref name=pmid18382099>{{Cite journal| last1=Colonna| first1=J.| last2=Plaza| first2=JA.| last3=Frankel| first3=WL.| last4=Yearsley| first4=M.| last5=Bloomston| first5=M.| last6=Marsh| first6=WL.| title=Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: clinical and pathological features in 33 patients| journal=Pancreatology| volume=8| issue=2| pages=135–41| month=| year=2008| doi=10.1159/000123606| PMID=18382099 }}</ref> and may be associated with [[von Hippel-Lindau syndrome]].<ref name=pmid15659868>{{Cite journal| last1=Eras| first1=M.| last2=Yenigun| first2=M.| last3=Acar| first3= C.| last4=Kumbasar |first4=B.| last5=Sar| first5=F.| last6=Bilge| first6=T.| title=Pancreatic involvement in Von Hippel-Lindau disease| journal=Indian J Cancer| volume=41| issue=4| pages=159–61| month=| year=| doi=| PMID=15659868}}</ref>

In contrast to some of the other cyst-forming tumors of the pancreas (such as the [[intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm]] and the [[mucinous cystic neoplasm]]), serous cystic neoplasms are almost always entirely benign.  There are some exceptions; rare case reports have described isolated malignant serous cystadenocarcinomas.<ref name=pmid17440789 >{{cite journal |author=Galanis C, Zamani A, Cameron JL, ''et al.''| title=Resected serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas: a review of 158 patients with recommendations for treatment| journal=J.

==Classification==
[[Pathologist]]s classify serous cystic neoplasms into two broad groups. Those that are benign, that have not spread to other organs, are designated "serous cystadenoma."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/BasicTypes1.php|title=Pathology of Neoplasms of the Pancreas |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> Serous cystadenomas can be further sub-typed into microcystic, oligocystic (or macrocystic), solid, mixed serous-endocrine neoplasm, and VHL-associated serous cystic neoplasm. This latter classification scheme is useful because it highlights the range of appearances and the clinical associations of these neoplasms. Serous cystic neoplasms that have spread ("metastasized") to another organ are considered malignant and are designated "serous cystadenocarcinoma."

==Diagnosis==
Serous cystic neoplasms can come to clinical attention in a variety of ways. The most common symptoms are very non-specific and include [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In contrast to many of the other tumors of the pancreas, patients rarely develop [[jaundice]] (a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by obstruction of the bile duct), or [[weight loss]]. These signs and symptoms are not specific for a serous cystic  neoplasm, making it more difficult to establish a diagnosis. Doctors will therefore often order additional tests.

Once a doctor has reason to believe that a patient may have serous cystic neoplasm, he or she can confirm that suspicion using one of a number of imaging techniques. These include [[computerized tomography]] (CT), [[endoscopic ultrasound]] (EUS), and [[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] (MRCP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/DiagTests.php |title=Diagnostic tests |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> These tests will reveal a cystic mass within the pancreas. The cysts do not communicate with the larger pancreatic ducts. In some cases a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy can be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. [[Fine needle aspiration]] [[biopsy]] can be performed through an endoscope at the time of endoscopic ultrasound, or it can be performed through the skin using a needle guided by ultrasound or CT scanning.
A growing number of patients are now being diagnosed before they develop symptoms (asymptomatic patients). In these cases, the lesion in the pancreas is discovered accidentally (by chance) when the patient is being scanned (x-rayed) for another reason.

==Treatment==
The treatment of choice is either [[surgery]], or if the clinician is certain of the diagnosis and the lesion is small, careful observation. Surgery can include the removal of the head of the pancreas (a [[pancreaticoduodenectomy]]), removal of the body and tail of the pancreas (a [[distal pancreatectomy]]), or rarely removal of the entire pancreas (a total pancreatectomy).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/TreatmentSurgery.php|title= Pancreatic Surgery |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> In selected cases the surgery can be performed using minimally invasive techniques such as [[laparoscopy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/TreatmentLaparoscopic.php|title=Laproscopic Pancreatic Surgery |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>
