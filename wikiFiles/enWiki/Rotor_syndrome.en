'''Rotor syndrome''', also called '''Rotor type hyperbilirubinemia''',<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|237450}}</ref> is a rare, relatively benign [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref name=rsar>{{cite pmid|766621}}</ref> [[bilirubin]] disorder of unknown origin. It is a distinct disorder, yet similar to [[Dubin–Johnson syndrome]]<ref name=omim/> — both diseases cause an increase in conjugated bilirubin.

==Characteristics==
Rotor syndrome has many things in common with Dubin–Johnson syndrome, an exception being that the liver cells are not pigmented. The main symptom is a non-itching [[jaundice]]. There is a rise in [[bilirubin]] in the patient's [[Blood plasma|serum]], mainly of the conjugated type. 

It can be differentiated from Dubin–Johnson syndrome in the following ways:

{| class="wikitable"
| || '''Rotor syndrome''' || '''DJS''' 
 |- 
| appearance of [[liver]] || normal histology and appearance   || liver has black pigmentation
 |- 
 | [[gallbladder]] visualization ||gallbladder can be visualized by oral cholecystogram  || gallbladder cannot be visualized
 |- 
 | total urine [[coproporphyrin]] content || high with <70% being isomer 1  || normal with >80% being isomer 1 (normal urine contains more of isomer 3 than isomer 1)
|}

== Genetics ==
[[Image:Autosomal recessive - en.svg|thumb|right|Rotor syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]
Rotor syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.<ref name=rsar/> This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

==Eponym==
Rotor syndrome is named after the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Internal medicine|internist]], [[Arturo Belleza Rotor]] (1907–1988).<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2296}}</ref>
