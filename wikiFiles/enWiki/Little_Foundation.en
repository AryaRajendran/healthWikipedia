'''The Little Foundation''' is a London based [[charitable organization|charity]] operating internationally.

Named in honour of [[William Little]], the English surgeon who described what became known as '[[Little's disease]]', a spastic paralysis of both lower limbs which then became known as infantile [[cerebral palsy]]. The charity, founded in 1990 by the late Ian Dawson-Shepherd,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-ian-dawsonshepherd-1324749.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Obituary: Ian Dawson-Shepherd | first=William | last=Hargreaves | date=19 January 1996 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref> initially focused on funding research<ref>"Brain project; Funded by the Little Foundation."
