'''Hair analysis''' may refer to the chemical analysis of a [[hair]] sample, but can also refer to microscopic analysis or comparison.  Chemical hair analysis may be considered for retrospective purposes when blood and urine are no longer expected to contain a particular contaminant, typically a year or less.<ref>Eastern Research Group.

Hair analysis can refer to the forensic technique of assessing a number of different characteristics of hairs, usually consisting of hairs from "known" sources and those recovered during forensic examinations or "questioned" hairs in order to determine whether they have a common source; for example, comparing hair found at the scene of the crime with hair samples taken from a suspect.  Typically, examinations of this type are conducted using stereo-microscope(s) for initial preparation, and a comparison microscope for detailed analysis (comparison).

== Use in forensic toxicology ==

Hair analysis is also used for the detection of many therapeutic drugs and [[recreational drugs]], including [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[benzodiazepines]] and [[amphetamines]].<ref name="welch">Welch, M.J., Sniegoski, L.T., Allgood, C.C., and Habram, M.

Hair testing is an increasingly common method of assessment in substance misuse, particularly in legal proceedings, or in any situation where a subject may have decided not to tell the entire truth about his or her substance-using history.

In December 1995 the Society of Hair Testing was founded to promote the research in hair testing technologies in forensic, clinical and occupational sciences, to develop the international proficiency tests, to organize meetings and workshops and to encourage the scientific cooperation and exchanges among members. The Board of the Society of Hair Testing agreed upon the latest version of a Consensus in Sevilla, Spain, in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Drug test==
{{main|drug test}}
Hair samples are increasingly being used to detect the presence of [[Illegal drug trade|illegal drugs]] both by the state and also by private employers who test their employees. The advantages of hair analysis include the non-invasiveness, low cost and the ability to measure a large number of, potentially interacting, toxic and biologically essential elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hairfollicledrugtest.com/ |title=What Companies Use Hair Follicle Tests for Pre-Employment? |publisher=Hairfollicledrugtest.com |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> The judicial admissibility of the test is guided by the [[Daubert standard]]. A precedent of national reference has been ''United States v. Medina, 749 F.Supp. 59 (E.D.N.Y.1990)''.<ref>Atlantic reporter: Second series, Volume 681. West Pub.

== Use in environmental toxicology ==

Analysis of hair samples has many advantages as a preliminary screening method for the presence of toxic substances deleterious to health after exposures in air, dust, sediment, soil and water, food and toxins in the environment.  The advantages of hair analysis include the non-invasiveness, low cost and the ability to measure a large number of, potentially interacting, toxic and biologically essential elements.    ''Hence, head hair analysis is now increasingly being used as a preliminary test to see whether individuals have absorbed poisons linked to behavioral or health problems.''<ref name=Master/>

=== Use in detection of long term elemental effects ===

There appears to be genuine validity to the use of hair analysis in the measurement of lifelong, or long-term heavy metal burden, if not the measurement of general elemental analysis. Several interesting studies including the analysis of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s hair have been conducted in conjunction with the [[National Institutes of Health]], and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to name a few.

A 1999 study on hair concentrations of [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]] in pregnant women and effects of supplementation, it was concluded that "From the analyses, it was clear that hair concentrations of Ca, Fe, and Zn could reflect the effects of supplementation... Finally, it could be concluded that mineral element deficiencies might be convalesced by adequate compensations of mineral element nutrients."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=10468164&query_hl=39&itool=pubmed_docsum |title=PMID 10468164 Hair concentrations of calcium, iron, and zinc in pregnant women and effects of supplementation |last1=Leung |first1=PL |last2=Huang |first2=HM |last3=Sun |first3=DZ |last4=Zhu |first4=MG |work=''Biol Trace Elem Res.'' 1999 Sep;69(3):269-82 |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate= }}</ref>

A recent review of scientific literature by Dr Kempson highlighted analysis of metals/minerals in hair can be applied in large population studies for researching epidemiology and groups of chronically exposed populations, however any attempt to provide a diagnosis based on hair for an individual is not possible.<ref name="Kempson">I.M. Kempson & E. Lombi, "Hair analysis as a biomonitor for toxicology, disease and health status" Chemical Society Reviews, 2011 {{doi|10.1039/C1CS15021A}}.</ref> An exception to this can be in advanced analyses for acute poisoning.<ref name="Kempson2">I.M.
