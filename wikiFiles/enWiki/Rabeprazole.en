'''Rabeprazole'''  {{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|æ|.|ˈ|b|ɛ|p|.|r|æ|.|z|ɔː|l}} is an antiulcer drug in the class of [[proton pump inhibitor]]s. It was developed by [[Eisai Co.]] and is marketed by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen-Cilag]] as '''rabeprazole sodium''' under the brand names '''AcipHex''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|ɨ|f|ɛ|k|s}}, referring to [[pH]]) in the US, '''Pariet''' in Europe, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Russia and Australia, and '''Razo''', '''Parit''' and Orpro in India.

==Indications and usage==
Short-term treatment in [[healing]] and [[symptom]]atic relief of duodenal ulcers and erosive or ulcerative gastroesophageal reflux disease ([[GERD]]); maintaining healing and reducing relapse rates of [[heartburn]] symptoms in patients with GERD; treatment of daytime and nighttime heartburn and other symptoms associated with GERD; long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin to eradicate ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.

*[[Gastric ulcer]] (GU)
*[[Peptic ulcer disease]] (PUD)
*Maintenance of healing of erosive or ulcerative GERD
*Healing of erosive and ulcerative GERD
*Healing of duodenal ulcers.
*Treatment of symptomatic GERD
*Treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions ([[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]])
*''Helicobacter pylori'' eradication to reduce risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence

==Contraindications==

*hypersensitivity to rabeprazole, substituted benzimidazoles or any of components of its pharmaceutical forms.
*pregnancy: FDA Pregnancy Ratings: B
*[[lactation]]: Thomson Lactation Ratings: Infant risk cannot be ruled out.

==Restriction of usage==

[[Image:Aciphex-sample-bottle.jpg|thumb|right|Bottle of rabeprazole 20 mg tablets.]]
*[[acute hepatic failure]]
*pediatric use in patients under 18 years of age (there are insufficient data about safety and efficiency of rabeprazole in this group of patients)

Antacid preparations such as rabeprazole by suppressing acid mediated break down of proteins, leads to an elevated risk of developing food or drug allergies. This happens due to undigested proteins then passing into the gastrointestinal tract where sensitisation occurs. It is unclear whether this risk occurs with only long-term use or with short-term use as well.<ref name="pmid21121928">{{cite journal |author=Pali-Schöll I, Jensen-Jarolim E |title=Anti-acid medication as a risk factor for food allergy |journal=Allergy |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=469–77 |year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21121928 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02511.x |url=}}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Rabeprazole decreases the concentration of [[ketoconazole]] in the plasma (in 33%), increases the concentration of [[digoxin]] (in 22%), and does not interact with liquid [[antacid]]s. Rabeprazole is compatible with any medicine metabolized by the [[CYP450]] ([[theophylline]], [[warfarin]], [[diazepam]], [[phenytoin]]).

==Overdosage==
Studies in mice and rats indicated the symptoms of acute toxicity due to [[overdose]] included: [[hypoactivity]], labored respiration, [[convulsion]], [[diarrhea]], [[tremor]], and coma. A study in dogs indicated that a dose of 2000mg/kg was not lethal.

==Formulations and brand names==
Rabeprazole as "CYRA" (Systopic Labs Pvt Ltd), "Elpizole" ([[Orchid Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals]]), "Elpizole -20" ([[Orchid Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals]]), Rablet (Lupin), Acigard (3D), AcipHex, Rabeloc, Pariet, Rabider (Duta Formulations) is supplied in:
*Tablet, [[enteric coating|enteric-coated]]; 10&nbsp;mg
*Tablet, enteric-coated; 20&nbsp;mg

Rabeprazole is sold under the brand names Acigard, Cyra, Rabium, Esoon, Rabemac, Rabiloz, Razo, Rabifast and Rablet in India, and Zechin in Pakistan.
