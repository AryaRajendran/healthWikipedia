This is a list of '''[[gene family|gene families]]''' or '''[[gene complex]]es''', that is sets of genes which occur across a number of different [[species]] which often serve similar biological functions.  These gene families typically encode functionally related [[protein]]s, and sometimes the term gene families is a shorthand for the sets of proteins that the genes encode.  They may or may not be physically adjacent on the same [[chromosome]].
