'''Double-balloon enteroscopy''', also known as '''push-and-pull [[enteroscopy]]''' is an [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] technique for visualization of the [[small bowel]].  It was developed by [[Hironori Yamamoto]] in 2001.<ref name=Yam1>{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = H | last2 = Sekine | first2 = Y | last3 = Sato | first3 = Y | last4 = Higashizawa | first4 = T | last5 = Miyata | first5 = T | last6 = Iino | first6 = S | last7 = Ido | first7 = K | last8 = Sugano | first8 = K | title = Total enteroscopy with a nonsurgical steerable double-balloon method | journal = Gastrointestinal endoscopy | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–20 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11174299 | doi = 10.1067/mge.2001.112181 }}</ref>  It is novel in the field of diagnostic [[gastroenterology]] as it is the first endoscopic technique that allows for the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]] to be visualized in real time.<ref name=Yam2>{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = H | last2 = Sugano | first2 = K | title = A new method of enteroscopy--the double-balloon method | journal = Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 273–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12704472 }}</ref>

==Technique==
The technique involves the use of a [[balloon]] at the end of a special [[enteroscope]] camera and an overtube, which is a tube that fits over the endoscope, and which is also fitted with a balloon.<ref name=Yam2/>  The procedure is usually done under general [[anesthesia]], but may be done with the use of [[sedation|conscious sedation]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = A | last2 = Nachbar | first2 = L | last3 = Wardak | first3 = A | last4 = Yamamoto | first4 = H | last5 = Ell | first5 = C | title = Double-balloon enteroscopy: preliminary experience in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic abdominal pain | journal = Endoscopy | volume = 35 | issue = 12 | pages = 985–91 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14648408 | doi = 10.1055/s-2003-44582 }}</ref>  The enteroscope and overtube are inserted through the [[mouth]] and passed in conventional fashion (that is, as with [[gastroscopy]]) into the [[small bowel]].<ref name=Yam1/>  Following this, the endoscope is advanced a small distance in front of the overtube and the balloon at the end is inflated.  Using the assistance of friction at the interface of the enteroscope and intestinal wall, the small bowel is accordioned back to the overtube.  The overtube balloon is then deployed, and the enteroscope balloon is deflated.  The process is then continued until the entire small bowel is visualized.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = H | last2 = Yano | first2 = T | last3 = Kita | first3 = H | last4 = Sunada | first4 = K | last5 = Ido | first5 = K | last6 = Sugano | first6 = K | title = New system of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal disorders | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = 1556; author reply 1556–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14628813 | doi = 10.1016/j.gastro.2003.03.004 }}</ref>

The double-balloon enteroscope can also be passed in retrograde fashion, through the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and into the [[ileum]] to visualize the end of the small bowel.<ref name=Yam1/>

==Indications==
Double-balloon enteroscopy has found a niche application in the following settings:
*bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract of obscure cause<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yen | first1 = HH | last2 = Chen | first2 = YY | last3 = Soon | first3 = MS | last4 = Lin | first4 = YM | title = An unusual cause of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding | journal = Gut | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 12, 28 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16507584 | pmc = 1856651 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2006.094631 }}</ref>

==Advantages and disadvantages==
[[File:SB polyp.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Endoscopic image of polyp in small bowel detected on double-balloon enteroscopy.]]
Double-balloon enteroscopy offers a number of advantages to other small bowel image techniques, including [[barium meal|barium]] imaging, [[wireless capsule endoscopy]] and [[push enteroscopy]]:
*it allows for visualization of the entire small bowel to the [[terminal ileum]]<ref name=Yam1/>
*it allows for the application of therapeutics<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = M | last2 = Yamamoto | first2 = H | last3 = Kita | first3 = H | last4 = Yano | first4 = T | last5 = Sunada | first5 = K | last6 = Miyata | first6 = T | last7 = Sugimoto | first7 = T | last8 = Iino | first8 = S | last9 = Sekine | first9 = Y | title = Gastrointestinal stromal tumor in the jejunum: diagnosis and control of bleeding with electrocoagulation by using double-balloon enteroscopy | journal = Journal of gastroenterology | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 1001–4 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15549455 | doi = 10.1007/s00535-004-1434-6 }}</ref>
*it allows for the sampling or [[biopsy]]ing of small bowel [[mucosa]], for the resection of [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] of the small bowel,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ohmiya | first1 = N | last2 = Taguchi | first2 = A | last3 = Shirai | first3 = K | last4 = Mabuchi | first4 = N | last5 = Arakawa | first5 = D | last6 = Kanazawa | first6 = H | last7 = Ozeki | first7 = M | last8 = Yamada | first8 = M | last9 = Nakamura | first9 = M | title = Endoscopic resection of Peutz-Jeghers polyps throughout the small intestine at double-balloon enteroscopy without laparotomy | journal = Gastrointestinal endoscopy | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 140–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15672077 | doi = 10.1016/S0016-5107(04)02457-5 }}</ref> and in the placement of [[stent]]s or [[Vasodilation|dilatation]] of [[stenosis|stricture]]s of the [[small bowel]].<ref name=Yam3/>
*it allows for access to the papilla in patients with long afferent limbs after Billroth II antrectomy.

The key disadvantage of double-balloon enteroscopy is the time required to visualize the small bowel; this can exceed three hours, and may require that patients be admitted to [[hospital]] for the procedure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lo | first1 = SK | last2 = Mehdizadeh | first2 = S | title = Therapeutic uses of double-balloon enteroscopy | journal = Gastrointestinal endoscopy clinics of North America | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 363–76 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16644464 | doi = 10.1016/j.giec.2006.03.002 }}</ref>  There have also been case reports of [[acute pancreatitis]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Honda | first1 = K | last2 = Mizutani | first2 = T | last3 = Nakamura | first3 = K | last4 = Higuchi | first4 = N | last5 = Kanayama | first5 = K | last6 = Sumida | first6 = Y | last7 = Yoshinaga | first7 = S | last8 = Itaba | first8 = S | last9 = Akiho | first9 = H | title = Acute pancreatitis associated with peroral double-balloon enteroscopy: a case report | journal = World journal of gastroenterology : WJG | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 1802–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16586559 }}</ref> and intestinal necrosis<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yen | first1 = HH | last2 = Chen | first2 = YY | last3 = Su | first3 = WW | last4 = Soon | first4 = MS | last5 = Lin | first5 = YM | title = Intestinal necrosis as a complication of epinephrine injection therapy during double-balloon enteroscopy | journal = Endoscopy | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 542 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16586243 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-925184 }}</ref> associated with the technique.
