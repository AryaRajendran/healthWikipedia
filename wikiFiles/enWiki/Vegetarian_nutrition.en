[[Image:Vegetarian diet.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A variety of vegetarian ingredients]]'''Vegetarian nutrition''' is the set of health-related challenges and advantages of [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diets.

Well-planned vegetarian and [[vegan]] diets are [[nutrition]]ally adequate and are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence.<ref name="ada"/> A vegetarian diet can provide adequate [[protein]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], and [[calcium]] intake, though these nutrients can be relatively low in poorly planned vegetarian diets, particularly when not enough calories are consumed.<ref name="ada"/>

Evidence suggests that vegetarians have lower rates of [[coronary heart disease]], [[obesity]], [[hypertension]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]],<ref name="ada"/> [[osteoporosis]],<ref>[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/25/6/555.pdf Incidence of osteoporosis in vegetarians and omnivores]</ref> and [[dementia]].<ref>[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Doi=110296 The Incidence of Dementia and Intake of Animal Products: Preliminary Findings from the Adventist Health Study]</ref>  Vegetarian diets tend to be rich in [[carbohydrates]], [[omega-6 fatty acids]], [[dietary fibre]], [[carotenoids]], [[folic acid]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]].  They are generally low in [[saturated fat]], [[cholesterol]], and animal protein.

==Benefits of a vegetarian diet==
The Oxford Vegetarian Study showed that the health of vegetarians compares favourably with that of meat-eaters (excluding [[pescetarians]]).<ref name="appleby2">Appleby PN, Thorogood M, Mann JI, Key TJ: “The Oxford Vegetarian Study: an overview”.  ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', 1999, 70:525S-531S.</ref>  British vegetarians have lower [[Mortality rate|death rates]] than non-vegetarians,<ref name="appleby2"/> although this is at least partly due to non-dietary lifestyle factors, such as a low prevalence of smoking and the generally high [[socioeconomic status]] of vegetarians, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish.<ref name="appleby">{{cite journal | last1 = Appleby | first1 = PN | last2 = Key | first2 = TJ | last3 = Thorogood | first3 = M | last4 = Burr | first4 = ML | last5 = Mann | first5 = J | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = | title = Mortality in British vegetarians | url = | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 2002 | issue = 5| pages = 29–36 }}</ref>

[[Loma Linda University School of Public Health]] has conducted three cohort studies that identify the health benefits of a vegetarian diet.<ref>[http://www.llu.edu/public-health/health/index.page? Adventist Health Studies]</ref>  The University is a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] health science institution. The first study, funded by the US Public Health Service in 1958 and limited to Adventists in California, included many vegetarians. The next cohort of California Adventists, the Adventist Health Study-1 (AHS-1), collected data from 1974 to 1976. From 2002 to 2007 the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) collected dietary data from 96,000 church members from the United States and Canada. Many scientific articles have been published on the health and nutrition properties of a vegetarian diet from these cohort studies.<ref>[http://www.llu.edu/public-health/health/pubs.page? List of scientific publications from the Adventist Health Studies]</ref> The most recent AHS-2 study includes findings on [[metabolic syndrome]],<ref>Rizzo N, et al.

The 2010 version of ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans,'' a report issued by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] every five years, states that

{{bquote|In prospective studies of adults, compared to non-vegetarian eating patterns, vegetarian-style [[healthy diet|eating patterns]] have been associated with improved health outcomes—lower levels of [[obesity]], a reduced risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], and lower total mortality. Several clinical trials have documented that vegetarian eating patterns lower blood pressure.
<P>
On average, vegetarians consume a lower proportion of calories from fat (particularly [[saturated fatty acid]]s); fewer overall calories; and more [[fiber]], [[potassium]], and [[vitamin C]] than do non-vegetarians. Vegetarians generally have a lower [[body mass index]]. These characteristics and other lifestyle factors associated with a vegetarian diet may contribute to the positive health outcomes that have been identified among vegetarians.<ref>http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/Chapter5.pdf</ref>}}

Vegetarians may avoid the negative health effects of [[Red meat#Health risks|red meat]]: A 1999 [[Meta-analysis|meta-study]] of five studies comparing vegetarian and non-vegetarian [[mortality rate]]s in Western countries found that in comparison with regular meat eaters, mortality from ischemic heart disease was 34% lower in people who ate fish but not meat ([[pescetarians]]), 34% lower in [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|ovo-lacto vegetarians]], 26% lower in vegans and 20% lower in occasional meat eaters.<ref name="key3">Key TJ, Fraser GE, Thorogood M, Appleby PN, Beral V, Reeves G, Burr ML, Chang-Claude J, Frentzel-Beyme R, Kuzma JW, Mann J, McPherson K: “Mortality in vegetarians and nonvegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies”.

==Potential nutrient deficiencies==
Poorly planned vegetarian diets may be low in [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], [[calcium]], [[omega-3 fatty acids]], [[vitamin D]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[riboflavin]] (vitamin B<sub>2</sub>), and [[iodine]], and poorly planned vegan diets may have particularly low intakes of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and calcium.<ref name="ada"/><ref name="key1"/>  Nonetheless, well-balanced vegetarian and vegan diets can meet all these nutrient requirements and are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including during [[pregnancy]], [[lactation]], [[infant|infancy]], [[childhood]], and [[adolescence]].<ref name="ada"/> Many tools are available to help vegetarians maintain an adequate nutrient balance including several [[Vegetarian Diet Pyramid]]s.<ref>[http://www.vegetariannutrition.org/food-pyramid.pdf Loma Linda University Vegetarian Food Pyramid]</ref><ref>[http://www.oldwayspt.org/vegetarian-diet-pyramid The Oldways Vegetarian Diet Pyramid]</ref>

=== Protein ===
The typical vegetarian gets adequate [[Protein in nutrition|protein]] as long as caloric intake is adequate and a variety of foods is eaten.<ref name=akers>Akers, Keith: ''[http://www.compassionatespirit.com/protein.htm But How Do You Get Enough Protein?]''.

"Nutrients of concern in vegetarian diets" in Sabaté J., ed. Vegetarian Nutrition (Boca Raton:CRC Press, 2001).</ref>

==== Combining proteins ====
Despite a widespread belief that vegetarians must eat grains and beans within a few hours of each other to make a 'complete' protein which contains all 9 "[[essential amino acid]]s", this has never been substantiated by research.  The protein-combining theory was brought to popular attention in [[Frances Moore Lappé]]'s 1971 bestseller ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]''.<ref name=akers/> In later editions of the book, as early as 1981, Lappé withdrew her contention that protein 'combining' is necessary.<ref>[[Frances Moore Lappé|Lappé, Frances Moore]] (1981).  ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'', p. 162.  ISBN 0-345-32120-0</ref>

=== Iron ===
In several studies, [[vegetarianism|vegans and other vegetarians]] were not found to suffer from [[iron]]-deficiency more than non-vegetarians.<ref>see: (1.) [Larsson CL, Johansson GK. Dietary intake and nutritional status of young vegans and omnivores in Sweden. Am J Clin Nutr. 2002;76:100–106. MEDLINE | http://www.adajournal.org/medline/record/ivp_00029165_76_100]. (2.)

[[Image:Tofu-beijingchina.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Tofu]] can be a valuable source of protein, iron, zinc and calcium]]

The recommended iron intake for vegetarians is 1.8 times that of nonvegetarians,<ref name="ada"/> because [[plant]]s, dairy, and eggs contain only non-heme iron, and this is absorbed less efficiently than heme iron.<ref name="nahrung"/> Although a lower ''percentage'' of non-heme iron is absorbed, greater ''amounts'' of non-heme iron are concentrated in many non-meat sources of iron (than the amount of iron per serving in meats), and therefore, cereals, eggs, nuts, seeds, and legumes (including soy foods, peas, beans, chickpeas, and [[lentils]]) are significant sources of iron,<ref>Nutrition Australia: ''[http://www.nutritionaustralia.org/Food_Facts/FAQ/vegetarian_new_detailed_faq.asp FAQ on Vegetarian Diets]'.' Retrieved 11 April 2007.</ref> and a well-planned vegetarian diet should not lead to iron deficiency, but fruitarianism and raw foods diets should not be pursued for infants or children.<ref name="ada"/> Meat, fish, and poultry (not dairy or eggs) are the only sources of [[heme]] iron; intake of heme iron may be associated with colon cancer.<ref>see: (1) http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/11/2274 | Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention Vol. 15, 2274-2279, November 2006</ref> Non-heme iron is more sensitive to both inhibitors and enhancers of iron absorption. [[Vitamin C]] is an iron absorption enhancer. The main inhibitors for most people are [[phytates]] (e.g. [[legume]]s and [[cereal|grains]]), but other inhibitors include [[tannins]] ([[tea]], [[wine]]), [[calcium]] and [[polyphenol]]s.<ref name="ada"/>

[[Iron]] is an integral part of many [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s which maintain good health. In humans, iron is an essential component of proteins involved in [[red blood cell]]s' [[oxygen]] transport. Iron also helps regulate [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]].

=== Zinc ===
{{further|Zinc deficiency}}
Western vegetarians and vegans have not been found to suffer from overt [[zinc]] deficiencies any more than meat-eaters.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Freeland-Graves | first1 = J.

Vegetarians may need more than the US RDA (15&nbsp;mg) of zinc daily if their diet is high in phytates.<ref name="ada"/>

Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soyfoods, nuts, peas, and seeds.<ref name="ada"/>

=== Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> ===
{{further|Vitamin B12 deficiency}}

[[Image:Huehnereier 2989.jpg|right|thumb|[[Egg (food)|Eggs]] are a source of vitamin B12 for vegetarians.]]

[[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] deficiency is potentially extremely serious, leading to [[megaloblastic anemia]], nerve degeneration and irreversible neurological damage.<ref name=b12/>

Lacto-ovo vegetarians may get vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from eggs and dairy products (milk, cheese, etc.);<ref name=ODS/> for some this is adequate but some may still remain B<sub>12</sub>-deficient.<ref name="ada"/> The world's largest group of professional dietitians says the form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> sourced from animal-products is protein-bound and not as easily digested, especially as people age, and therefore recommends B<sub>12</sub> supplementation for everyone over the age of 50.<ref name="ada"/> Pregnant and lactating vegetarians (and breastfed infants if the mother's diet is not supplemented) should also use supplements, whether pills, injections, or B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods, if they don't get adequate B<sub>12</sub> from animal-products like eggs or [[dairy]].

=== Omega-3 fatty acids ===
[[Image:Flax seeds.jpg|thumb|left|[[flax|Flax seed]] is a rich source of ALA, but contains negligible amounts of DHA and EPA, the [[omega-3 fatty acids]] the FDA considers to be healthful.]] Vegetarian diets can be low in [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s (O3FA). Major vegetarian sources of O3FA include [[algae]], [[hemp|hempseeds and hempseed oil]], [[walnut]]s, [[flax|flaxseeds and flaxseed oil]], [[olive oil]], [[canola]] ([[rapeseed]]) oil, [[avocado]] and [[salvia hispanica|chia seeds]]. However, diets lacking fish, eggs, or generous amounts of sea vegetables (seaweed) generally lack a direct source of long-chain O3FA such as [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA). Vegetarian diets may also have a high ratio of [[Omega-6 fatty acids|O6FA]] to O3FA, which inhibits the conversion of short-chain fatty acids such as [[alpha-Linolenic acid]] (ALA), found in most vegetarian O3FA sources, to EPA and DHA.<ref name="ada"/> Short-term supplemental ALA has been shown to increase EPA levels but not DHA levels, suggesting poor conversion of the intermediary EPA to DHA.<ref name="dha">{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Thomas A.B.|date=August–September 2009|title=DHA status of vegetarians|journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Essential Fatty Acids|publisher=International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids|volume=81|issue=2–3|pages=137–141|issn=0952-3278|doi=10.1016/j.plefa.2009.05.013|pmid=19500961}}</ref> DHA supplements derived from DHA-rich [[alga|microalgae]] are available,<ref name="ada"/> and the human body can also convert DHA to EPA.<ref>http://content.health.msn.com/content/article/91/101125.htm?GT1=5100{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref>

Vegans who do not eat foods or pills fortified with synthetic vitamin D and with little exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation (e.g., those who don't expose their extremities for at least 15–30 minutes per day or those living at [[latitude]]s close to the [[geographical pole|pole]]s) are vulnerable to Vitamin D deficiencies.

Vitamin D acts as a [[hormone]], sending a message to the [[intestine]]s to increase the absorption of [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]], which produces strong [[bone]]s. Vitamin D also works in concert with a number of other [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s, and hormones to promote bone [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]. Research also suggests that vitamin D may help maintain a healthy [[immune system]] and help regulate [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]].

=== Iodine ===
{{further|Iodine deficiency}}
One study reported a "potential danger of [iodine] deficiency disorders due to strict forms of vegetarian nutrition, especially when fruits and vegetables grown in soils with low [iodine] levels are ingested."<ref>Thomas Remer, Annette Neubert and Friedrich Manz: “Increased risk of iodine deficiency with vegetarian nutrition”. ''British Journal of Nutrition'', 1999, 81:45-49. Retrieved 4 January 2007.</ref> Iodine, however, is usually supplied by [[iodized salt]] and other sources in [[First World|first world countries]]. Other significant sources of iodine include sea vegetables (seaweed) and bread made with [[dough conditioner]]s.<ref name="ada"/>
