Some of the types include (deep and superficial) annular erythema, erythema perstans, erythema gyratum perstans, erythema gyratum repens, darier erythema (Deep gyrate erythema & Deep gyrate erythema) and erythema figuratum perstans.

==Symptoms==
Occurring at any age these lesions appear as raised pink-red ring or bulls-eye marks. They range in size from {{convert|0.5|–|8|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The lesions sometimes increase size and spread over time and may not be complete rings but irregular shapes. Distribution is usually on the thighs and legs but can also appear on the upper extremities, areas not exposed to sunlight, trunk or face. Currently EAC is not known to be contagious, but as many cases are incorrectly diagnosed as EAC, it is difficult to be certain.

==Diagnosis==
There are no specific tests that can be performed to test for EAC; tests should be performed to rule out other possible diseases such as: pityriasis rosea, tinea corporis, psoriasis, nummular eczema, atopic dermatitis, drug reaction, erythema migrans and other [[rash]]es.

==Causes==
Often no specific cause for the eruptions is found. However, it is sometimes linked to underlying diseases and conditions such as:

* Food (including blue cheese or tomatoes).
* Contact Dermatitis (ie. cleaning agents, fabric softeners, etc)
* [[List of infectious diseases|Fungal, Bacterial and Viral infections]] such as [[sinusitis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[candidiasis]] or [[tinea]].
* [[list of drugs|Drugs]] including [[finasteride]],<ref name="pmid17668547">{{cite journal |author=Al Hammadi A, Asai Y, Patt ML, Sasseville D |title=Erythema annulare centrifugum secondary to treatment with finasteride |journal=J Drugs Dermatol |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=460–3 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17668547 |doi= |url=}}</ref> [[chloroquine]], [[hydroxychloroquine]], [[oestrogen]], [[penicillin]] and [[amitriptyline]].
* [[CANCER-sensitivity to malignancy]] (especially the type known as erythema gyratum perstans, in which there are concentric and whirling rings).  
* [[Primary biliary cirrhosis]].
* [[Graves disease]].
* [[Appendicitis]].
* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|Lupus]]<ref name="pmid14631185">{{cite journal |author=Weyers W, Diaz-Cascajo C, Weyers I |title=Erythema annulare centrifugum: results of a clinicopathologic study of 73 patients |journal=Am J Dermatopathol |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=451–62 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14631185 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0193-1091&volume=25&issue=6&spage=451}}</ref>
* [[Pregnancy]] (EAC usually disappears/stops soon after delivery of baby).
* [[Hormone]] (Contraceptive Pill, Stress, Hormone Drugs)
* [[Lyme Disease]]

==Treatment==
No treatment is usually needed as they usually go away anywhere from months to years. The lesions may last from anywhere between 4 weeks to 34 years with an average duration of 11 months. If caused by an underlying disease or malignancy, then treating and removing the disease or malignancy will stop the lesions. It usually doesn't require treatment, but topical [[corticosteroids]] may be helpful<ref name="pmid8939316">{{cite journal |author=Enta T |title=Dermacase. Erythema annulare centrifugum |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=42 |issue= |pages=2148, 2151 |year=1996 |month=November |pmid=8939316 |pmc=2146938 |doi= |url=}}</ref> in reducing redness, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] and [[itchiness]].

Some supported and not supported methods of having an effect on EAC include:
* Photosensitive so it can be moved/reduced with appropriate sunlight.
* Vitamin D
* Immune system - hence it will increase in size/number when the immune system is low or overloaded.
* Hormone Drugs
* Disulone
* Topical calcipotriol - a topical vitamin D derivative has been known to be beneficial

== Alternative diagnosis ==
* [[Sarcoidosis]]
* [[Fungal infection in animals|Fungal infection]]
* [[Lupus erythematosus]]

== Interesting information ==
It is very rare and estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 per year. Because of its rarity the documentation, cases and information is sparse and not a huge amount is known for certain, meaning that EAC could actually be a set of many un-classified skin lesions. It is known to occur at all ages and all genders equally. Some articles state that women are more likely to be affected than men.
