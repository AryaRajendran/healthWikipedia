'''CHIMES Society'''[http://chimes-society.org/] is an international academic collaboration whose objective is to establish new stroke treatments.

CHIMES is a Singaporean non-profit society founded by a group of key opinion leaders in stroke, Southeast Asia regional experts, and clinicians interested in implementing a research project on [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] efficacy on [[stroke]] recovery.

==Current research project==
CHIMES society has received a grant in 2007 from Singapore National Medical Research Council which has allowed the initiation of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [[clinical trial]] in October 2007. The trial includes 1,100 patients and aims at measuring the efficacy of [[NeuroAid]] in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome in patients with [[cerebral infarction]].<ref>This trial is currently recruiting patients and details can be found at the ClinicalTrials.gov database from NIH under reference NCT00554723.</ref>

==Prior research projects==
Clinical studies were conducted in China from 1999 to 2001 and the results have been submitted for publication. Since publication is pending, further information will be provided here when the publication is released.
