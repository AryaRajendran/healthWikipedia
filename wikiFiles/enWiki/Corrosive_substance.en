A '''corrosive substance''' is one that will destroy and damage other substances with which it comes into contact. It may attack a great variety of [[materials]], including [[metals]] and various [[organic compounds]], but people are mostly concerned with its effects on [[tissue (biology)|living tissue]].

==Chemical terms==
The word 'corrosion' is derived from the Latin verb ''corrodere'', which means 'to gnaw', indicating how these substances seem to 'gnaw' their way through the flesh. Sometimes the word 'caustic' is used as a synonym but, by convention, 'caustic' generally refers only to [[strong base]]s, particularly [[alkali]]s, and not to [[acid]]s, [[oxidizer]]s, or other non-alkaline corrosives. The term 'acid' is often used imprecisely for all corrosives.

A low concentration of a corrosive substance is usually an [[Irritation|irritant]]. [[Corrosion]] of non-living surfaces such as metals is a distinct process. For example, a water/air electrochemical cell corrodes [[iron]] to [[rust]]. In the [[Globally Harmonized System]], both rapid [[corrosion]] of metals and chemical corrosion of skin qualify for the "corrosive" symbol.

Corrosives are different from poisons in that corrosives are immediately dangerous to the tissues they contact, whereas poisons may have systemic toxic effects that require time to become evident. Colloquially, corrosives may be called "poisons" but the concepts are technically distinct. However there is nothing which precludes a corrosive from being a poison; there are substances that are both corrosives and poisons.

==Effects on living tissue==

Common corrosives are either [[strong acid]]s, [[strong base]]s, or concentrated solutions of certain [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s. They can exist as any [[state of matter]], including [[liquids]], [[solids]], [[gases]], [[mists]] or [[vapors]].

Their action on living tissue (e.g. [[skin]], [[flesh]] and [[cornea]]) is mainly based on [[acid-base catalysis]] of amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis. [[Proteins]] (chemically composed of [[amide]] bonds) are destroyed via [[amide hydrolysis]] while [[lipids]] (many of which have [[ester]] bonds) are decomposed by [[ester hydrolysis]]. These reactions lead to [[chemical burn]]s and are the mechanism of the destruction posed by corrosives.

Some corrosives possess other [[chemical properties]] which may extend their corrosive effects on living tissue. For example, [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric acid (sulphuric acid)]] at a high [[concentration]] is also a [[dehydrating agent|strong dehydrating agent]],<ref name="OA">{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamicscience.com.au/tester/solutions/chemistry/sulfuricacid1.html|title=Sulfuric acid – uses}}</ref> capable of dehydrating [[carbohydrates]] and liberating extra [[heat]]. This results in [[burn#By depth|secondary thermal burns]] in addition to the chemical burns and may speed up its decomposing reactions on the contact surface. Some corrosives, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid, are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s as well, which significantly contributes to the extra damage caused. [[Hydrofluoric acid]] does not necessary cause noticeable damage upon contact, but produces [[Hydrofluoric acid#Health and safety|tissue damage and toxicity]] after being painlessly absorbed. [[Zinc chloride]] solutions are capable of destroying [[cellulose]] and corroding through paper and [[silk]] since the [[zinc]] [[cation]]s in the solutions specifically attack [[hydroxyl group]]s, acting as a [[Lewis acid]]. 

In addition, some corrosive chemicals, mostly [[acid]]s such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[nitric acid]], are [[volatile]] and can emit corrosive mists upon contact with [[air]]. Inhalation can damage the [[respiratory tract]].

Corrosive substances are most hazardous to eyesight. A drop of a corrosive may cause [[blindness]] within 2–10 seconds through [[Red eye (medicine)#Corneal opacification|opacification]] or direct destruction of the [[cornea]]. 

Ingestion of corrosives can induce severe consequences, including serious damage of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], which can lead to [[vomiting]], severe [[stomach aches]], and even death.

==Common types of corrosive substances==
Common corrosive chemicals are classified into:
* [[Acid]]s
:*[[Strong acid]]s &mdash; the most common are [[sulfuric acid]], [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub> and HCl, respectively).
:*Some concentrated [[weak acid]]s, for example [[formic acid]] and [[acetic acid]]
:*Strong [[Lewis acid]]s such as anhydrous [[aluminum chloride]] and [[boron trifluoride]]
:*[[Lewis acid]]s with specific reactivity, e.g. solutions of [[zinc chloride]]
:*Extremely strong acids ([[superacid]]s)
* [[Base (chemistry)|Bases]]
:*Caustics or alkalis, such as [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) and [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH)
:*[[Alkali metals]] in the metallic form (e.g. elemental [[sodium]]), and hydrides of alkali and [[alkaline earth metal]]s, such as [[sodium hydride]], function as strong bases and hydrate to give caustics
:*Extremely strong bases ([[superbase]]s) such as [[alkoxide]]s, metal amides (e.g. [[sodium amide]]) and [[organometallic]] bases such as [[butyllithium]]
:*Some concentrated weak bases, such as [[ammonia]] when anhydrous or in a concentrated solution
* Dehydrating agents such as concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], [[phosphorus pentoxide]], [[calcium oxide]], anhydrous [[zinc chloride]], also elemental alkali metals
* Strong oxidizers such as concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]]
* Electrophilic [[halogen]]s: elemental [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]] and [[iodine]], and electrophilic salts such as [[sodium hypochlorite]] or N-chloro compounds such as [[chloramine-T]];<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0413.html International Chemical Safety Card for Chloramine-T]</ref> [[halide]] ions are not corrosive, except for fluoride
* Organic halides and organic acid halides such as [[acetyl chloride]] and [[benzyl chloroformate]]
* Acid [[anhydride]]s
* [[Alkylating agent]]s such as [[dimethyl sulfate]]
* Some organic materials such as [[phenol]] ("carbolic acid")

==Personal protective equipment==
Use of [[personal protective equipment]], including items such as protective gloves, protective aprons, acid suits, safety goggles, a face shield, or safety shoes, is normally recommended when handling corrosive substances.  Users should consult a [[material safety data sheet]] for the specific recommendation for the corrosive substance of interest.  The material of construction of the personal protective equipment is of critical importance as well.  For example, although rubber gloves and rubber aprons may be made out of a chemically resistant [[elastomer]] such as [[nitrile rubber]], [[neoprene]], or [[butyl rubber]], each of these materials has different resistance to different corrosives and they should not be substituted for each other.

==Uses==
Some corrosive chemicals are valued for various uses, the most common of which is in [[cleaning agent|household cleaning agents]]. For example, most [[drain cleaner|domestic drain openers]] contain either acids or alkalis due to their capabilities of dissolving [[fat|greases]] and [[proteins]] inside water pipes such as limescale.<ref name="dc">{{cite web|url=http://www.herchem.com/products/drainwaste.html|title=Drain and Waste systems cleaners}}</ref>

In chemical uses, high chemical reactivity is often desirable, as the rates of chemical reactions depend on the [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] (effective concentration) of the reactive species. For instance, [[catalytic]] sulfuric acid is used in the [[alkylation]] process in an oil refinery: the activity of carbocations, the [[reactive intermediate]], is higher with stronger acidity, and thus the reaction proceeds faster. Once used, corrosives are most often recycled or neutralized. However, there have been environmental problems with untreated corrosive effluents or accidental discharges.
