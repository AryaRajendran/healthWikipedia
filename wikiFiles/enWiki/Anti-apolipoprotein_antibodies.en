In autoimmune disease, '''anti-[[apolipoprotein H]]''' (AAHA) antibodies, also called anti-β<sub>2</sub> glycoprotein I antibodies, comprise a subset of [[anti-cardiolipin antibodies]] and [[lupus anticoagulant]]. These antibodies are involved in sclerosis and are strongly associated with thrombotic forms of lupus.<ref name="pmid1782567">{{cite journal | author = Viard JP, Amoura Z, Bach JF | title = [Anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus: a marker of thrombosis associated with a circulating anticoagulant] | language = French | journal = C.

Also, it was proposed that AAHA is responsible for [[lupus anticoagulant]]. However, [[antiphospholipid syndrome|antiphospholipid]] antibodies bind phospholipids at sites similar to sites bound by anti-coagulants such as PAP1 sites and augment anti-coagulation activity.<ref name="pmid1372614">{{cite journal | author = Sammaritano LR, Gharavi AE, Soberano C, Levy RA, Lockshin MD | title = Phospholipid binding of antiphospholipid antibodies and placental anticoagulant protein | journal = J.

This contrasts with the major, specific, activity of AAHA, defining a subset of [[anti-cardiolipin antibodies]] that specifically interacts with Apo-H.<ref name="pmid8485053">{{cite journal | author = Galli M, Bevers EM, Comfurius P, Barbui T, Zwaal RF | title = Effect of antiphospholipid antibodies on procoagulant activity of activated platelets and platelet-derived microvesicles | journal = Br.

A subset of AHAA appear to mimic the activity of lupus anticoagulant and increase Apo-H binding to phospholipids.<ref name="pmid9151800">{{cite journal | author = Takeya H, Mori T, Gabazza EC, ''et al.'' | title = Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) monoclonal antibodies with lupus anticoagulant-like activity enhance the beta2GPI binding to phospholipids | journal = J.

AAHA interferes with [[factor Xa]] inhibition by Apo-H increasing factor Xa generation. However, like Apo-H the Lupus anticoagulant inhibits factor Xa generation.<ref name="pmid8236146">{{cite journal | author = Shi W, Chong BH, Hogg PJ, Chesterman CN | title = Anticardiolipin antibodies block the inhibition by beta 2-glycoprotein I of the factor Xa generating activity of platelets | journal = Thromb.

AAHA also inhibited the autoactivation of factor XII <ref name="pmid7482406">{{cite journal | author = Schousboe I, Rasmussen MS | title = Synchronized inhibition of the phospholipid mediated autoactivation of factor XII in plasma by beta 2-glycoprotein I and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I | journal = Thromb.

A synchronized inhibition of factor XII autoactivation by Apo-H and AHAA has been suggested.

==Genetics==
The hapolotype [[HLA-DR4]]-[[HLA-DQ3|DQ3]] appears to play a role in the pathogenic AAHA production. The alleles primarily recognized are [[HLA-DR53]]<ref name="pmid10643701">{{cite journal | author = Hattori N, Kuwana M, Kaburaki J, Mimori T, Ikeda Y, Kawakami Y | title = T cells that are autoreactive to beta2-glycoprotein I in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and healthy individuals | journal = Arthritis Rheum. | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–75 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10643701 | doi = 10.1002/1529-0131(200001)43:1<65::AID-ANR9>3.0.CO;2-I}}</ref> (DRB4*01), DRB1*0402,<ref name="pmid10715100">{{cite journal | author = Galeazzi M, Sebastiani GD, Tincani A, ''et al.'' | title = HLA class II alleles associations of anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies in a large series of European patients with systemic lupus erythematosus | journal = Lupus | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–55 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10715100 | doi =10.1177/096120330000900109 }}</ref> DQA1*03,<ref name="pmid10626742">{{cite journal | author = Ioannidis JP, Tektonidou MG, Vlachoyiannopoulos PG, ''et al.'' | title = HLA associations of anti-beta2 glycoprotein I response in a Greek cohort with antiphospholipid syndrome and meta-analysis of four ethnic groups | journal = Hum.

All of these alleles are in linkage disequilbrium in the DRB4*01:DRB1*0402:DQA1*0301:DQB1*0302 haplotype, also called DR4-DQ8 and also the DQA1:0303:DQB1*0301 haplotype, DR4-DQ7.3. However in European Americans which reflects a broad area of Europe in which the original studies were conducted only DR4(0402)-[[HLA-DQ8|DQ8]] was found, indicating that the entire haplotype is involved.<ref name="pmid12974796">{{cite journal | author = Klitz W, Maiers M, Spellman S, ''et al.'' | title = New HLA haplotype frequency reference standards: high-resolution and large sample typing of HLA DR-DQ haplotypes in a sample of European Americans | journal = Tissue Antigens | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 296–307 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12974796 | doi =10.1034/j.1399-0039.2003.00103.x }}</ref>

[[HLA-DR7]] may also be associated with these antibodies and the common haplotype association is the [[HLA-DR53]] serotype.
