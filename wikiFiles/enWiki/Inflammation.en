'''Inflammation''' ([[Latin]], ''[[wikt:en:inflammo#Latin|īnflammō]]'', "I ignite, set alight") is part of the complex biological response of [[Blood vessel|vascular]] tissues to harmful stimuli, such as [[pathogen]]s, damaged cells, or irritants.<ref name="pmid17223962">{{cite journal |author=Ferrero-Miliani L, Nielsen OH, Andersen PS, Girardin SE |title=Chronic inflammation: importance of NOD2 and NALP3 in interleukin-1beta generation |journal=Clin.

Inflammation is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli and to initiate the healing process. Inflammation is not a synonym for [[infection]], even in cases where inflammation is caused by infection. Although infection is caused by a microorganism, inflammation is one of the responses of the organism to the pathogen. However, inflammation is a stereotyped response, and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of [[innate immune system|innate immunity]], as compared to [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]], which is specific for each pathogen.<ref name="ABBAS">{{cite book | author = Abbas A.B. | coauthors = Lichtman A.H. | title = Basic Immunology.

Progressive destruction of the tissue would compromise the survival of the organism. However, chronic inflammation can also lead to a host of diseases, such as [[hay fever]], [[periodontitis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and even cancer (e.g., [[gallbladder carcinoma]]). It is for that reason that inflammation is normally closely regulated by the body.

Inflammation can be classified as either ''acute'' or ''chronic''. ''Acute inflammation'' is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of [[blood plasma|plasma]] and [[leukocyte]]s (especially [[granulocyte]]s) from the blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local [[vascular system]], the [[immune system]], and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as ''chronic inflammation'', leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and [[healing]] of the tissue from the inflammatory process.

Acute inflammation is a short-term process, usually appearing within a few minutes or hours and ceasing upon the removal of the injurious stimulus.<ref name="robspath" />  It is characterized by five cardinal signs:<ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs">{{cite book|author=Parakrama Chandrasoma, Clive R.

The acronym that may be used for this is "PRISH" for Pain, Redness, Immobility (loss of function), Swelling and Heat.

The traditional names for signs of inflammation come from Latin:
* [[Pain|Dolor]] ([[pain]])
* Calor ([[heat]])
* [[Rubor]] (redness)
* [[Tumor]] ([[swelling (medical)|swelling]])
* [[Functio laesa]] (loss of function)<ref name="Ruth Werner: A massage Therapist Guide to Pathology 4th edition">[http://thepoint.lww.com/Book/ShowWithResource/2931?resourceId=16419 A Massage Therapist Guide to Pathology] {{cite book|author= Ruth Werner |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |location=Philadelphia, PA and Baltimore, MD |year= 2009 |title=A massage Therapist Guide to Pathology |edition=4th}}</ref>

The first four (classical signs) were described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca 30 BC–38 AD),<ref>{{cite book |first=Wolfgang H. |last=Vogel |first2=Andreas |last2=Berke |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t_5pzrF1QocC&pg=PA97&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Brief History of Vision and Ocular Medicine |publisher=Kugler Publications |page=97 |isbn=90-6299-220-X }}</ref> while ''loss of function'' was added later by [[Galen]]<ref name="isbn0-7817-7087-4">{{cite book |author=Porth, Carol |title=Essentials of pahtophysiology: concepts of altered health states |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages=270 |isbn=0-7817-7087-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> even though the attribution is disputed and the origination of the fifth sign has also been ascribed to [[Thomas Sydenham]]<ref name="isbn0-300-11322-6">{{cite book |author=Dormandy, Thomas |title=The worst of evils: man's fight against pain |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2006 |pages=22 |isbn=0-300-11322-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> and [[Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow|Virchow]].<ref name="robspath">{{cite book | title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease| last=Cotran| coauthors=Kumar, Collins| publisher=W.B Saunders Company| location=Philadelphia| isbn=0-7216-7335-X | year=1998}}</ref><ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" />

Redness and heat are due to increased blood flow at body core temperature to the inflamed site; swelling is caused by accumulation of fluid; [[pain]] is due to release of chemicals that stimulate nerve endings.  Loss of function has multiple causes.<ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" />

These five signs appear when acute inflammation occurs on the body's surface, whereas acute inflammation of internal organs may not result in the full set. Pain only happens where the appropriate sensory nerve endings exist in the inflamed area—e.g., acute inflammation of the lung ([[pneumonia]]) does not cause pain unless the inflammation involves the [[parietal pleura]], which does have [[nociceptor|pain-sensitive nerve endings]].<ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" />

=== Process of acute inflammation ===

[[File:Acute inflammation of prostate.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing acute inflammation of the [[prostate gland]] with the characteristic [[neutrophil]]ic infiltrate. [[H&E stain]].]]
The process of acute inflammation is initiated by cells already present in all tissues, mainly resident [[macrophages]], [[dendritic cells]], histiocytes, Kupffer cells and [[mastocytes]].
These cells present on their surfaces certain receptors named ''[[pattern recognition receptor]]s'' (PRRs), which recognize molecules that are broadly shared by [[pathogen]]s but distinguishable from host molecules, collectively referred to as [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMPs).  At the onset of an infection, burn, or other injuries, these cells undergo activation (one of their PRRs recognize a PAMP) and release [[inflammatory mediators]] responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation. Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow causes the redness (''rubor'') and increased heat (''calor''). Increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation (leakage) of [[blood plasma|plasma]] proteins and fluid into the tissue ([[edema]]), which manifests itself as swelling (''tumor''). Some of the released mediators such as [[bradykinin]] increase the sensitivity to pain ([[hyperalgesia]], ''dolor'').  The mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes, mainly [[neutrophils]], outside of the blood vessels (extravasation) into the tissue. The neutrophils migrate along a [[chemotactic]] gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury.<ref name="robspath" /> The loss of function (''functio laesa'') is probably the result of a neurological reflex in response to pain.

In addition to cell-derived mediators, several acellular biochemical cascade systems consisting of preformed plasma proteins act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response. These include the [[complement system]] activated by bacteria and the [[coagulation system|coagulation]] and [[fibrinolysis system]]s activated by [[necrosis]], e.g. a burn or a trauma.<ref name="robspath" />

The acute inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained. Inflammatory mediators have short half lives and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence, acute inflammation ceases once the stimulus has been removed.<ref name="robspath" />

== Exudative component ==
The ''[[exudative component]]'' involves the movement of [[Blood plasma|plasma fluid]], containing important [[protein]]s such as [[fibrin]] and [[immunoglobulin]]s ([[antibodies]]), into inflamed tissue. This movement is achieved via the chemically induced dilation and increased permeability of [[blood vessel]]s, which results in a net loss of [[blood plasma]]. The increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell ([[edema]]). This extravasated fluid is funneled by [[lymphatics]] to the regional lymph nodes, flushing bacteria along to start the recognition and attack phase of the [[adaptive immune system]].

=== Vascular changes ===
Acute inflammation is characterized by marked vascular changes, including [[vasodilation]], increased permeability and increased blood flow, which are induced by the actions of various inflammatory mediators. Vasodilation occurs first at the [[arteriole]] level, progressing to the [[capillary]] level, and brings about a net increase in the amount of blood present, causing the redness and heat of inflammation. Increased permeability of the vessels results in the movement of [[blood plasma|plasma]] into the tissues, with resultant ''[[stasis (medicine)|stasis]]'' due to the increase in the concentration of the cells within blood - a condition characterized by enlarged vessels packed with cells. Stasis allows [[leukocytes]] to marginate (move) along the [[endothelium]], a process critical to their recruitment into the tissues. Normal flowing blood prevents this, as the [[Shear stress|shearing force]] along the periphery of the vessels moves cells in the blood into the middle of the vessel.

=== Plasma cascade systems ===
* The [[complement system]], when activated, creates a cascade of chemical reactions that promotes [[Antibody opsonization|opsonization]], [[chemotaxis]], and [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]], and produces the [[Membrane attack complex|MAC]].
* The [[kinin system]] generates proteins capable of sustaining vasodilation and other physical inflammatory effects.
* The [[coagulation system]] or ''clotting cascade'' which forms a protective protein mesh over sites of injury.
* The [[fibrinolysis system]], which acts in opposition to the ''coagulation system'', to counterbalance clotting and generate several other inflammatory mediators.

=== Plasma derived mediators ===

{| class="wikitable"
! '''Name''' || '''Produced by''' || '''Description'''
|-
| align="center" | '''[[Bradykinin]]''' || align="center" | ''[[Kinin system]]'' || A vasoactive protein which is able to induce vasodilation, increase vascular permeability, cause smooth muscle contraction, and induce pain.
|-

C3a stimulates histamine release by mast cells, thereby producing vasodilation. C3b is able to bind to bacterial cell walls and act as an [[opsonin]], which marks the invader as a target for [[phagocytosis]].
|-

|-
| align="center" | '''[[Factor XII]]''' (''Hageman Factor'') || align="center" | ''[[Liver]]'' || A protein which circulates inactively, until activated by collagen, platelets, or exposed [[basement membrane]]s via [[conformational change]]. When activated, it in turn is able to activate three plasma systems involved in inflammation: the kinin system, fibrinolysis system, and coagulation system.
|-

Thrombin can also bind to cells via the [[Protease-activated receptor|PAR1]] receptor to trigger several other inflammatory responses, such as production of [[chemokine]]s and [[nitric oxide]].
|}

== Cellular component ==
The ''cellular component'' involves [[leukocyte]]s, which normally reside in blood and must move into the inflamed tissue via ''extravasation'' to aid in inflammation. Some act as [[phagocyte]]s, ingesting [[bacteria]], viruses, and cellular debris. Others release enzymatic [[granule (cell biology)|granules]] which damage pathogenic invaders. Leukocytes also release inflammatory mediators which develop and maintain the inflammatory response. Generally speaking, acute inflammation is mediated by [[granulocyte]]s, while chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as [[monocyte]]s and [[lymphocyte]]s.

=== Leukocyte extravasation ===
[[File:NeutrophilerAktion.png|200px|thumb|right|Neutrophils migrate from blood vessels to the infected tissue via chemotaxis, where they remove pathogens through phagocytosis and degranulation]]
{{Main|Leukocyte extravasation}}
Various [[leukocyte]]s are critically involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. These cells must be able to get to the site of injury from their usual location in the blood, therefore mechanisms exist to recruit and direct leukocytes to the appropriate place. The process of leukocyte movement from the blood to the tissues through the blood vessels is known as ''extravasation'', and can be divided up into a number of broad steps:
# '''Leukocyte localisation and recruitment to the endothelium local to the site of inflammation – involving margination and adhesion to the endothelial cells:''' Recruitment of leukocytes is [[cell receptor|receptor]]-mediated. The products of inflammation, such as [[histamine]], promote the immediate expression of [[P-selectin]] on endothelial cell surfaces. This receptor binds weakly to carbohydrate ligands on leukocyte surfaces and causes them to "roll" along the endothelial surface as bonds are made and broken. Cytokines from injured cells induce the expression of [[E-selectin]] on endothelial cells, which functions similarly to P-selectin. Cytokines also induce the expression of [[immunoglobulin]] ligands such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, which further slow leukocytes down. These weakly bound leukocytes are free to detach if not activated by chemokines produced in injured tissue. Activation increases the affinity of bound integrin receptors for immunoglobulin ligands on the endothelial cell surface, firmly binding the leukocytes to the endothelium.
# '''Migration across the endothelium, known as'' transmigration, ''via the process of [[diapedesis]]:''' Chemokine gradients stimulate the adhered leukocytes to move between endothelial cells and pass the basement membrane into the tissues.
# '''Movement of leukocytes within the tissue via [[chemotaxis]]:''' Leukocytes reaching the tissue interstitium bind to [[extracellular matrix]] proteins via expressed integrins and [[CD44]] to prevent their loss from the site. [[Chemoattractant]]s cause the leukocytes to move along a chemotactic gradient towards the source of inflammation.

== Morphologic patterns ==
Specific patterns of acute and chronic inflammation are seen during particular situations that arise in the body, such as when inflammation occurs on an [[epithelial]] surface, or [[pyogenic]] bacteria are involved.
* '''Granulomatous inflammation:''' Characterised by the formation of [[granuloma]]s, they are the result of a limited but diverse number of diseases, which include among others [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[sarcoidosis]], and [[syphilis]].
* '''Fibrinous inflammation:''' Inflammation resulting in a large increase in vascular permeability allows [[fibrin]] to pass through the blood vessels. If an appropriate ''procoagulative'' stimulus is present, such as cancer cells,<ref name="robspath" /> a fibrinous exudate is deposited. This is commonly seen in [[serous membrane|serous cavities]], where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between serous membranes, limiting their function. The deposit sometimes forms a pseudomembrane sheet. During inflammation of the intestine ([[Pseudomembranous colitis]]), pseudomembranous tubes can be formed.
* '''Purulent inflammation:''' Inflammation resulting in large amount of [[pus]], which consists of neutrophils, dead cells, and fluid. Infection by pyogenic bacteria such as [[staphylococci]] is characteristic of this kind of inflammation. Large, localised collections of pus enclosed by surrounding tissues are called [[abscess]]es.
* '''Serous inflammation:''' Characterised by the copious effusion of non-viscous serous fluid, commonly produced by [[mesothelial]] cells of [[serous membrane]]s, but may be derived from blood plasma. Skin [[blister]]s exemplify this pattern of inflammation.
* '''Ulcerative inflammation:''' Inflammation occurring near an epithelium can result in the [[necrotic]] loss of tissue from the surface, exposing lower layers. The subsequent excavation in the epithelium is known as an [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]].

== Inflammatory disorders ==
Inflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders which underlie a vast variety of human diseases. The immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders, demonstrated in both [[allergic reaction]]s and some [[myopathies]], with many [[immune system disorder]]s resulting in abnormal inflammation. Non-immune diseases with etiological origins in inflammatory processes include cancer, [[atherosclerosis]], and [[ischaemic heart disease]].<ref name="robspath" />

A large variety of proteins are involved in inflammation, and any one of them is open to a genetic mutation which impairs or otherwise dysregulates the normal function and expression of that protein.

Examples of disorders associated with inflammation include:
<div style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:2;">

=== Atherosclerosis ===

{{main|Atherosclerosis}}
Atherosclerosis, formerly considered a bland lipid storage disease, actually involves an ongoing inflammatory response. Recent advances in basic science have established a fundamental role for inflammation in mediating all stages of this disease from initiation through progression and, ultimately, the thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis. These new findings provide important links between risk factors and the mechanisms of atherogenesis. Clinical studies have shown that this emerging biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis applies directly to human patients. Elevation in markers of inflammation predicts outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes, independently of myocardial damage. In addition, low-grade chronic inflammation, as indicated by levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, prospectively defines risk of atherosclerotic complications, thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors. Moreover, certain treatments that reduce coronary risk also limit inflammation. In the case of lipid lowering with statins, this anti-inflammatory effect does not appear to correlate with reduction in low-density lipoprotein levels. These new insights into inflammation in atherosclerosis not only increase our understanding of this disease, but also have practical clinical applications in risk stratification and targeting of therapy for this scourge of growing worldwide importance. [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/105/9/1135 Clinical Cardiology: New Frontiers (Inflammation and Atherosclerosis)]

=== Allergies ===
An allergic reaction, formally known as [[Type I hypersensitivity|type 1 hypersensitivity]], is the result of an inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation. A common example is [[hay fever]], which is caused by a hypersensitive response by skin [[mast cell]]s to [[allergen]]s. Pre-sensitised mast cells respond by [[degranulation|degranulating]], releasing [[vasoactive]] chemicals such as histamine. These chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation, production of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokine release, and recruitment of leukocytes.<ref name="robspath" /> Severe inflammatory response may mature into a systemic response known as [[anaphylaxis]].

Other [[hypersensitivity]] reactions (''[[Type II hypersensitivity|type 2]]'' and ''[[Type III hypersensitivity|type 3]]'') are mediated by antibody reactions and induce inflammation by attracting leukocytes which damage surrounding tissue.<ref name="robspath" />

=== Myopathies ===
Inflammatory myopathies are caused by the immune system inappropriately attacking components of muscle, leading to signs of muscle inflammation. They may occur in conjunction with other immune disorders, such as [[systemic sclerosis]], and include [[dermatomyositis]], [[polymyositis]], and [[inclusion body myositis]].<ref name="robspath" />

=== Leukocyte defects ===
Due to the central role of leukocytes in the development and propagation of inflammation, defects in leukocyte function often result in a decreased capacity for inflammatory defense with subsequent vulnerability to infection.<ref name="robspath" /> Dysfunctional leukocytes may be unable to correctly bind to blood vessels due to surface receptor mutations, digest bacteria ([[Chediak-Higashi syndrome]]), or produce [[microbicide]]s ([[chronic granulomatous disease]]). Additionally, diseases affecting the [[bone marrow]] may result in abnormal or few leukocytes.

=== Pharmacological ===
Certain drugs  or exogenic chemical compounds are known to affect inflammation. [[Vitamin A]] deficiency causes an increase in inflammatory responses,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wiedermann U |title=Vitamin A deficiency increases inflammatory responses |journal=Scand J Immunol. |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=578–584 |year=1996 |pmid=8972739 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-351.x |author-separator=, |display-authors=1 |last2=Chen |first2=X.-J. |last3=Enerback |first3=L. |last4=Hanson |first4=L.

=== Cancer ===
Inflammation orchestrates the microenvironment around tumours, contributing to proliferation, survival and migration. Cancer cells use [[selectins]], [[chemokines]] and their receptors for invasion, migration and metastasis.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Coussens |first=L. M. |last2=Werb |first2=Z. |title=Inflammation and cancer |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=420 |issue=6917 |pages=860–867 |year=2002 |pmid=12490959 |doi=10.1038/nature01322 |pmc=2803035}}</ref> On the other hand, many cells of the immune system contribute to [[cancer immunology]], suppressing cancer.<ref>PMID 22914051</ref>
Molecular intersection between receptors of steroid hormones, which have important effects on cellular development, and transcription factors that play key roles in inflammation, such as [[NF-κB]], may mediate some of the most critical effects of inflammatory stimuli on cancer cells.<ref>PMID 19382224</ref> This capacity of a mediator of inflammation to influence the effects of steroid hormones in cells, is very likely to affect carcinogenesis on the one hand; on the other hand, due to the modular nature of many steroid hormone receptors, this interaction may offer ways to interfere with cancer progression, through targeting of a specific protein domain in a specific cell type. Such an approach may limit side effects that are unrelated to the tumor of interest, and may help preserve vital homeostatic functions and developmental processes in the organism.

=== Resolution of inflammation ===
The inflammatory response must be actively terminated when no longer needed to prevent unnecessary "bystander" damage to tissues.<ref name="robspath" />  Failure to do so results in chronic inflammation, and cellular destruction. Resolution of inflammation occurs by different mechanisms in different tissues.

{{Cquote|Acute inflammation normally resolves by mechanisms that have remained somewhat elusive. Emerging evidence now suggests that an active, coordinated program of resolution initiates in the first few hours after an inflammatory response begins. After entering tissues, [[granulocyte]]s promote the switch of [[arachidonic acid]]–derived [[prostaglandin]]s and [[leukotriene]]s to lipoxins, which initiate the termination sequence. [[Neutrophil]] recruitment thus ceases and programmed death by [[apoptosis]] is engaged. These events coincide with the biosynthesis, from [[omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids]], of [[resolvins]] and [[Neuroprotectin|protectins]], which critically shorten the period of neutrophil infiltration by initiating apoptosis. Consequently, apoptotic neutrophils undergo [[phagocytosis]] by [[macrophage]]s, leading to neutrophil clearance and release of anti-inflammatory and reparative [[cytokines]] such as transforming growth factor-β1. The anti-inflammatory program ends with the departure of macrophages through the [[Lymphatic system|lymphatics]].<ref name="pmid16369558">{{cite journal |author=Serhan CN, Savill J |title=Resolution of inflammation: the beginning programs the end |journal=Nat.

=== Connection to depression ===
There is evidence for a link between inflammation and depression. Inflammatory processes can be triggered by negative cognitions or their consequences, such as stress, violence, or deprivation. Thus, negative cognitions can cause inflammation that can, in turn, lead to depression.<ref

== Systemic effects ==
An [[infectious organism]] can escape the confines of the immediate tissue via the [[circulatory system]] or [[lymphatic system]], where it may spread to other parts of the body. If an organism is not contained by the actions of acute inflammation it may gain access to the lymphatic system via nearby [[lymph vessel]]s. An infection of the lymph vessels is known as [[lymphangitis]], and infection of a lymph node is known as [[lymphadenitis]]. When lymph nodes cannot destroy all pathogens, the infection spreads further. A pathogen can gain access to the bloodstream through lymphatic drainage into the circulatory system.

When inflammation overwhelms the host, [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] is diagnosed. When it is due to [[infection]], the term [[sepsis]] is applied, with the terms [[bacteremia]] being applied specifically for bacterial sepsis and [[viremia]] specifically to viral sepsis. [[Vasodilation]] and organ dysfunction are serious problems associated with widespread infection that may lead to [[septic shock]] and death.

=== Acute-phase proteins ===
Inflammation also induces high systemic levels of [[acute-phase protein]]s. In acute inflammation, these proteins prove beneficial, however in chronic inflammation they can contribute to [[amyloidosis]].<ref name="robspath" /> These proteins include [[C-reactive protein]], [[serum amyloid A]], and [[serum amyloid P]], which cause a range of systemic effects including:<ref name="robspath" />
<div style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:2;">
* [[Fever]]
* Increased [[blood pressure]]
* Decreased [[sweating]]
* [[Malaise]]
* [[Anorexia (symptom)|Loss of appetite]]
* [[Somnolence]]
</div>

=== Leukocyte numbers ===
Inflammation often affects the numbers of leukocytes present in the body:
* [[Leukocytosis]] is often seen during inflammation induced by infection, where it results in a large increase in the amount of leukocytes in the blood, especially immature cells. Leukocyte numbers usually increase to between 15 000 and 20 000 cells per microliter, but extreme cases can see it approach 100 000 cells per microliter.<ref name="robspath" /> Bacterial infection usually results in an increase of [[neutrophil]]s, creating [[neutrophilia]], whereas diseases such as [[asthma]], [[hay fever]], and parasite infestation result in an increase in [[eosinophil]]s, creating [[eosinophilia]].<ref name="robspath" />
* [[Leukopenia]] can be induced by certain infections and diseases, including viral infection, ''[[Rickettsia]]'' infection, some [[protozoa]], [[tuberculosis]], and some [[cancer]]s.<ref name="robspath" />

=== Systemic inflammation and obesity ===
With the discovery of [[interleukin]]s (IL), the concept of [[systemic inflammation]] developed. Although the processes involved are identical to tissue inflammation, systemic inflammation is not confined to a particular tissue but involves the [[endothelium]] and other organ systems.

Chronic inflammation is widely observed in obesity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kershaw |first=E. E. |last2=Flier |first2=J.

Low-grade chronic inflammation is characterized by a two- to threefold increase in the systemic concentrations of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=A.

The body attacks fat similar to bacteria and fungi. When expanded fat cells leak or break open, macrophages mobilize to clean up and embed into the adipose tissue. Then macrophages release inflammatory chemicals, including TNF-α and (IL-6). TNF's primary role is to regulate the immune cells and induce inflammation. White blood cells then assist by releasing more [[cytokine]]s. This link between adiposity and inflammation has been shown to produce 10-35% of IL-6 in a resting individual, and this production increases with increasing adiposity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mohamed-Ali |first=V. |last2=''et al.'' |title=Subcutaneous adipose tissue releases interleukin-6, but not tumor necrosis factor-α, in vivo |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |year=1997 |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=4196–4200 |doi=10.1210/jc.82.12.4196 |pmid=9398739 |first2=S |last3=Rawesh |first3=A |last4=Katz |first4=DR |last5=Miles |first5=JM |last6=Yudkin |first6=JS |last7=Klein |first7=S |last8=Coppack |first8=SW }}</ref>

Leptin resistance plays a role in the process where appetite overrules the message of satiety. Angptl2 then starts an inflammatory cascade causing blood vessels to remodel and attract macrophages. Angptl2 is an adipocyte-derived inflammatory mediator linking obesity to systemic insulin resistance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It is possible that, as an inflammatory marker, [[Leptin#Clinical significance|leptin responds specifically to adipose-derived inflammatory cytokines]].

== Outcomes ==
[[File:Scar (xndr).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Scars present on the skin, evidence of fibrosis and healing of a wound]]
The outcome in a particular circumstance will be determined by the tissue in which the injury has occurred and the injurious agent that is causing it. Here are the possible outcomes to inflammation:<ref name="robspath" />

# '''Resolution'''<br />The complete restoration of the inflamed tissue back to a normal status. Inflammatory measures such as vasodilation, chemical production, and leukocyte infiltration cease, and damaged [[parenchyma]]l cells regenerate. In situations where limited or short lived inflammation has occurred this is usually the outcome.
# '''[[Fibrosis]]'''<br />Large amounts of tissue destruction, or damage in tissues unable to regenerate, can not be regenerated completely by the body. Fibrous [[scarring]] occurs in these areas of damage, forming a scar composed primarily of [[collagen]]. The scar will not contain any specialized structures, such as [[parenchyma]]l cells, hence functional impairment may occur.
# '''Abscess Formation'''<br />A cavity is formed containing pus, an opaque liquid containing dead white blood cells and bacteria with general debris from destroyed cells.
# '''Chronic inflammation'''<br />In acute inflammation, if the injurious agent persists then chronic inflammation will ensue. This process, marked by inflammation lasting many days, months or even years, may lead to the formation of a [[chronic wound]]. Chronic inflammation is characterised by the dominating presence of macrophages in the injured tissue. These cells are powerful defensive agents of the body, but the [[toxin]]s they release (including [[reactive oxygen species]]) are injurious to the organism's own tissues as well as invading agents. Consequently, chronic inflammation is almost always accompanied by tissue destruction.

== Examples ==
Inflammation is usually indicated by adding the suffix "[[wikt:-itis|-itis]]", as shown below. However, some conditions such as [[asthma]] and [[pneumonia]] do not follow this convention. More examples are available at [[list of types of inflammation]].

== Exercise and inflammation ==

===Exercise-induced acute inflammation===

Acute inflammation of the [[muscle cells]], as understood in exercise physiology,<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilmore|first=Jack|title=Physiology of Sport and Exercise|year=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=978-0-7360-5583-3|pages=26–36, 98–120, 186–250, 213–218}}</ref> can result after [[Muscle contraction|induced]] [[Eccentric contraction|eccentric]] and [[Concentric contraction|concentric]] muscle training.  Participation in eccentric training and conditioning, including resistance training and activities that emphasize eccentric lengthening of the [[muscle]] including downhill running on a moderate to high incline can result in considerable soreness within 24 to 48 hours, even though [[blood lactate]] levels, previously thought to cause muscle soreness, were much higher with level running.  This [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS) results from structural damage to the contractile filaments and [[Muscle cells|z-disks]], which has been noted especially in marathon runners whose muscle fibers revealed [[Marathon runner|remarkable damage]] to the muscle fibers after both training and marathon competition.  The onset and timing of this [[Resistance training|gradient damage]] to the muscle parallels the degree of muscle soreness experienced by the runners.

Z-disks are the point of contact for the contractile proteins.  They provide structural support for the transmission of force when the muscle fibers are activated to shorten.  However, in marathon runners and those who subscribe to the overload principle to enhance their muscles, show moderate Z-disk streaming and major disruption of the thick and thin filaments in parallel groups of sarcomeres as a result of the force of eccentric actions or stretching of the tightened muscle fibers.

This disruption of the muscle fibers triggers white blood cells to increase following the induced muscle soreness, leading to the inflammatory response observation from the induced muscle soreness. Elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure are concluded to be associated with the inflammatory response. High tension in the contractile-elastic system of muscle results in structural damage to the muscle fiber and plasmalemma and its epimysium, perimysium, and/or endomysium.  The mysium damage disrupts calcium homeostasis in the injured fiber and fiber bundles, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 48 hours after exercise.  The products of the macrophage activity and intracellular contents (such as histamines, kinins, and K<sup>+</sup>) accumulate outside the cells. These substances then stimulate the free nerve endings in the muscle; a process that appears accentuated by eccentric exercise, in which large forces are distributed over a relatively small cross-sectional area of the muscle.

In particular, the increase in levels of IL-6 can reach up to one hundred times that of resting levels.<ref name="Bruunsgaard" /> Depending on volume, intensity, and other training factors, the IL-6 increase associated with
training initiates about 4 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for up to 24 hours.<ref name="McKay">McKay BR, De Lisio M, Johnston AP, O’Reilly CE, Phillips SM, Tarnopolsky MA, Parise G.

These acute increases in cytokines, as a response to muscle contractions, help initiate the process of muscle repair and growth by activating [[satellite cell]]s within the inflamed muscle.

===Signal-to-noise theory===

Given that localized acute inflammation is a necessary component for muscle growth, and that chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with a disruption of anabolic signals initiating muscle growth, it has been theorized that a [[signal-to-noise]] model may best describe the relationship between inflammation and muscle growth.<ref>Pilon, Brad. "Inflammation Affects Your Ability to Build Muscle." Inflammation Theory | Inflammation, Chronic Inflammation, Muscle Building, Health. Web. 27 Mar. 2011. <http://www.inflammationtheory.com/#2>.</ref> By keeping the "noise" of chronic inflammation to a minimum, the localized acute inflammatory response signals a stronger anabolic response than could be achieved with higher levels of chronic inflammation.
