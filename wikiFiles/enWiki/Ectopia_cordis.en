'''Ectopia cordis''' (Latin: ''"outside/away" + "heart"'') is a [[congenital malformation]] in which the [[heart]] is abnormally located either partially or totally outside of the [[human thorax|thorax]].  The ectopic heart can be found along a spectrum of anatomical locations, including the neck, chest, or abdomen.  In most cases, the heart protrudes outside the chest through a split [[Human sternum|sternum]]. <ref name="Park" />

==Epidemiology==
The occurrence of ectopic cordis is 8 per million births. <ref name="Morales" />  It is typically classified according to location of the ectopic heart, which includes:

*Cervical
*Thoracic
*Thoracoabdominal
*Abdominal

Thoracic and thoraco-abdominal ectopa cordis constitute the vast majority of known cases. <ref name="Park"/>

==Pathology==
Ectopia cordis results from a failure of proper maturation of midline [[mesoderm]] and ventral body wall formation during [[embryonic development]]. <ref name="Morales" />  The exact etiology remains unknown, but abnormalities in the lateral body wall folds are believed to be involved.  Normally, the lateral body walls are responsible for fusion at the midline to form the ventral wall.  Corruption of this process may underlie ectopia cordis. <ref name="Sadler" />

Defective ventral body wall formation yields a heart unprotected by the pericardium, sternum, or skin. Other organs may also have formed outside the skin, as well.  Many cases of ectopia cordis have associated [[congenital heart defect]]s, in which the heart has failed to properly form.

Defects more commonly associated with ectopia cordis include: <ref name="Park" /> <ref name="Morales" /> <ref name="Kleigman" />

*Intracardiac defects
**[[Atrial septal defect]]
**[[Ventricular septal defect]]
**[[Tetralogy of Fallot]]
**[[Tricuspid atresia]]
**[[Double outlet right ventricle]]
*Non-cardiac malformations
**[[Pentalogy of Cantrell]]
**[[Omphalocele]]
**Anterior diaphragmatic hernia
**[[Cleft palate]]

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of ectopia cordis depends on classification according to three factors: <ref name="Park" />
#Location of the defect
#* Cervical
#* Thoracic
#* Thoracoabdominal
#* Abdominal
#Extent of the cardiac displacement
#Presence or absence of intracardiac defects

Some studies have suggested a better prognosis with surgery in cases of thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis or less severe [[pentalogy of Cantrell]].  In general, the prognosis for ectopia cordis is poor -- most cases result in death shortly after birth due to infection, hypoxemia, or cardiac failure. <ref name="Kleigman" />

==Treatment==
Due to the rarity and rapid postpartum mortality of ectopia cordis, limited treatment options have been developed.  Successful surgeries have been performed, but the mortality rate remains high. <ref name="Morales" />
