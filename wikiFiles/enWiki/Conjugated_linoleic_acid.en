==History==
In 1979, researchers from the University of Wisconsin applied a beef extract to mice skin.  The mice were then exposed to a strong carcinogen.  When the researchers counted the number of tumors developed by the mice 16 weeks later, they found to their surprise that the mice exposed to the beef extract had 20% fewer tumors.  The identity of this anticarcinogen was not discovered until almost a decade later, in 1987.  Michael Pariza, the scientist who discovered CLA, later remarked that "few anticarcinogens, and certainly no other known fatty acids, are as effective as CLA in inhibiting carcinogenesis in these models."<ref name="pmid3119246">{{cite journal

The [[Nutritional Immunology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory]] (NIMML) demonstrated that oral CLA treatment prevents or ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease by activating the nuclear receptor [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPAR gamma).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15362034 | year = 2004 | last1 = Bassaganya-Riera | first1 = J | last2 = Reynolds | first2 = K | last3 = Martino-Catt | first3 = S | last4 = Cui | first4 = Y | last5 = Hennighausen | first5 = L | last6 = Gonzalez | first6 = F | last7 = Rohrer | first7 = J | last8 = Benninghoff | first8 = AU | last9 = Hontecillas | first9 = R | title = Activation of PPAR gamma and delta by conjugated linoleic acid mediates protection from experimental inflammatory bowel disease | volume = 127 | issue = 3 | pages = 777–91 | journal = Gastroenterology | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2004.06.049}}</ref> In 2012, NIMML conducted a human clinical trial administering 6 grams/day of a CLA supplement to [[Crohn's disease]] patients and reported a remarkable improvement in Crohn's disease activity index and quality of life measures.<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://www.vbi.vt.edu/marketing_and_communications/press_releases_view/researchers_discover_novel_therapy_for_crohns_disease | title = Researchers discover novel therapy for Crohn’s disease | publisher = Marketing and Communications, Virginia Bioinformatics Institute | date = March 16, 2012 }}</ref> These clinical improvements paralleled modulation of T cell responses in blood subjects that received CLA supplement.

CLA is also known for its body weight management properties, which include reducing body fat and increasing lean muscle mass.  Over 30 clinical studies have been published investigating the effect of CLA on weight management.  The trials have quite variable designs, which leads to inconsistency.  However a meta-analysis conducted in 2007 concluded CLA has a small impact on fat mass.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whigham L |title=Efficacy of conjugated linoleic acid for reducing fat mass:a meta-analysis in humans|journal=Am.

The United States Food and Drug Administration categorizes CLA as [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS) status for certain food categories, including fluid milk, yogurt, meal replacement shakes, nutritional bars, fruit juices and soy milk.{{cn|date=December 2012}}  With GRAS status, food companies are able to add CLA to products in these food categories.

==Biochemistry==
Most studies of CLAs have used a mixture of isomers wherein the isomers c9,t11-CLA and t10,c12-CLA were the most abundant.<ref name=usda />  More recent studies using individual isomers indicate that the two isomers have very different health effects.<ref name="Tricon S, Burdge GC, Kew S, et al. 2004 614–20"/><ref name="Risérus">

Conjugated linoleic acid is both a [[trans fat|''trans'' fatty acid]] and a ''cis'' fatty acid. The ''cis'' bond causes a lower melting point and ostensibly also the observed beneficial health effects. Unlike other ''trans'' fatty acids, it may have beneficial effects on human health.<ref>[http://www.milk.co.uk/page.aspx?intPageID=283 II International Congress on CLA from Experimental Models to Human Application]</ref> CLA is [[conjugated system|conjugated]], and in the United States, ''trans'' linkages in a conjugated system are not counted as ''trans'' fats for the purposes of nutritional regulations and labeling.{{fact|date=March 2013}} CLA and some ''trans'' isomers of [[oleic acid]] are produced by microorganisms in the [[rumen]]s of ruminants. Non-ruminants, including humans, produce certain isomers of CLA from ''trans'' isomers of oleic acid, such as [[vaccenic acid]], which is converted to CLA by [[desaturase|delta-9-desaturase]].<ref name=Kuhnt2006>{{cite journal| author=Kuhnt K, Kraft J, Moeckel P, Jahreis G| title=Trans-11-18 : 1 is effectively Delta9-desaturated compared with trans-12-18 : 1 in humans| journal= Br J Nutr.| year=2006| month=April|volume=95|issue=4|pages=752–761|pmid=16571155| doi=10.1079/BJN20051680}}</ref><ref name=Banni>{{cite journal |author=Banni S, Angioni E, Murru E, Carta G, Melis M, Bauman D, Dong Y, Ip C |title=Vaccenic acid feeding increases tissue levels of conjugated linoleic acid and suppresses development of premalignant lesions in rat mammary gland |journal=Nutr Cancer |volume=41 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–7 |year=2001 |pmid=12094634 |doi=10.1207/S15327914NC41-1&2_12 |doi_brokendate=2010-09-04}}</ref>

The most promising science around CLA concerns its affect on weight management. Thirty-five intervention studies have been conducted using CLA in humans to investigate the effects of CLA on weight management. These studies, which vary widely in CLA dose and duration, show the most significant effect of CLA on weight management is on body composition, a reduction in total body fat and an increase in lean body mass.  The effect of CLA on fat mass is modest and at the recommended dosage of 3.2 g/day produces a statistically significant 90 g fat loss per week (about 1&nbsp;lb in 5 wk) as shown by a 2007 meta-analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Whingham LD, Watras CA, Scholler DA | year = 2007 | title = Efficacy of conjugated linoleic acid for reducing fat mass: a meta-analysis in humans. Am | url = | journal = J Clin Nutr | volume = 85 | issue = 5| pages = 1203–1200 }}</ref> Doses higher than the recommended 3.2g do not seem to have any additional effects on body fat reduction. Another meta-analysis found that CLA supplementation produces about 1% increased growth in targeted lean body mass per week <ref>{{cite journal | author = Steck SE, Chalecki AM, Miller P, Conway J, Austin GL, Hardin JW, Albright CD, Thuillier P. | year = 2007 | title = Conjugated linoleic acid supplementation for twelve weeks increases lean body mass in obese humans. | pmid = 17449580 | journal = J Nutr. | volume = 137 | issue = 5| pages = 1188–93 }}</ref> With the simultaneous decrease in fat mass coupled with increases in lean body mass, often the net change in weight is small. However, the effects of CLA on body composition is a healthy effect, since the degree of fat mass is related to many causes of mortality<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heitmann BL, Erikson H, Ellsinger BM, Mikkelsen KL, Larrson B | year = 2000 | title = Mortality associated with body fat, fat-free mass and body mass index among 60-year-old swedish men - a 22-year follow-up.

CLA use itself is not an answer to the prevalence of obesity, but it can be a useful tool in addition to a healthy lifestyle and exercise program to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.

===Possible adverse effects of CLA (supplements) in humans===
There are concerns that the use of CLA supplements by extremely overweight people may tend to cause or to aggravate insulin resistance, which may increase their risk of developing [[diabetes]].<ref name="Risérus"/> Commercially available supplements contain equal mixtures of two CLA isomers: the cis-9, trans-11 isomer (also known as rumenic acid, the predominant CLA isomer in milk and beef), as well as the trans-10, cis-12 (t10c12) isomer. All other isomers ratios found in the scientific literature are not commercially available. The trans-10, cis-12 isomer is linked to many adverse side effects.  Research indicates that supplementation with t10c12 CLA dramatically increases rates of [[oxidative stress]], to levels considerably higher than that observed in heavy smokers.<ref name="Risérus"/>

However, the evidence is controversial, and some studies using a mixture of c9t11 and t10c12 CLA showed no changes in insulin sensitivity.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v31/n3/abs/0803437a.html|last1=Watras|first1=AC|last2=Buchholz|first2=AC|last3=Close|first3=RN|last4=Zhang|first4=Z|last5=Schoeller|first5=DA | title=The role of conjugated linoleic acid in reducing body fat and preventing holiday weight gain|accessdate=2008-09-30|journal=International Journal of Obesity | volume=31 | issue = 3|pages=481–7|date=2006-08-22|pmid=16924272|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803437}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Syvertsen|url=http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v31/n7/abs/0803482a.html|first1=C|last2=Halse|first2=J|last3=Høivik|first3=HO|last4=Gaullier|first4=JM|last5=Nurminiemi|first5=M|last6=Kristiansen|first6=K|last7=Einerhand|first7=A|last8=O'Shea|first8=M|last9=Gudmundsen|first9=O|title=The effect of 6 months supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid on insulin resistance in overweight and obese|accessdate=2008-09-30|journal=International Journal of Obesity  | volume=31 | issue =7|pages=1148–54|date=2006-10-10|pmid=17031391|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803482}}</ref> 
A study in 2007 used the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method, which is the gold standard, to evaluate insulin resistance. The study performed on 49 obese or overweight individuals taking 3.2g CLA per day for six months found no adverse effects on blood glucose management. In addition, the long-term studies of one and two years have found CLA supplementation to be well tolerated, but there was an increase in some markers associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk, and two of 134 subjects had increased levels of transaminases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gaullier JM, Hals J, Hoye K, Kristiansen K, Fagertun H, Vik H, Gudmundsen O | year = 2005 | title = Supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid for 24 months is well tolerated by and reduces body fat mass in healthy, overweight humans | url = | journal = J Nutr | volume = 135 | issue = 4| pages = 778–84 | pmid = 15795434 }}</ref> In one study, t10c12 CLA produced a 32% increase in biliary cholesterol concentration, which increases the chance of gallstone formation.<ref>33.^ * {{cite journal | author = Nazare JA | year = 2007 | title = Daily intake of conjugated linoleic acid-enriched yoghurts:effects on energy metabolism and adipose tissue gene expression in healthy subjects | url = | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 273–280 | author-separator = , | author2 = Perriere AB | author3 = Bonnet F | author4 = Desage M | author5 = Peyrat J | author6 = Maitrepierre C | author7 = Louche-Pelissier C | author8 = Bruzeau J | author9 = Goudable J | display-authors = 9 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114507191911 | pmid = 17298695 }}</ref> In 2006, a study by the [[US Department of Agriculture]] suggested CLA can induce essential fatty acid redistribution in mice. Changes in [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[arachidonic acid]] (AA) levels were observed in some organs. For instance, the t10,c12 CLA reduced the DHA content of heart tissue by 25%, while in the spleen, DHA content rose, and AA fell. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid important to cardiovascular health, and the dramatic reduction of DHA in heart tissue can have serious health consequences. In contrast, c9,t11 CLA did not alter DHA content in the heart, but did reduce spleen DHA slightly.<ref name=usda>{{cite web

The general consensus is that the use of this supplement should be carefully examined if the person using the supplement is greatly overweight.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20040520/cla-weight-loss | title = Weight Loss & Diet Plans | publisher = [[WebMD]]}}</ref>

A CLA supplement containing the t10,c12 isomer may be deleterious to women whose breast epithelium or tumor overexpresses Her2/ErbB2, as well, potentially, to other women at risk for breast cancer.
