'''Micromastia''', or '''breast [[hypoplasia]]''', is a medical term describing the postpubertal underdevelopment of a woman's breast tissue.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic117.htm eMedicine - Breast Augmentation, Subglandular : Article by Howard T Bellin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Just as it is impossible to define 'normal' breast size, there is no objective definition of micromastia. Breast development is commonly asymmetric and one or both breasts may be small. This condition may be a congenital defect associated with underlying abnormalities of the pectoral muscle (as in [[Poland's syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Poland  | first = Alfred  | title = Deficiency of the pectoral muscles  | journal = Guy's Hospital Reports |volume =VI | pages =191â€“193  | date =1841 }}</ref>), related to trauma (typically [[surgery]] or [[radiotherapy]]) or it may be a more subjective aesthetic description.

Self perceived micromastia involves a discrepancy between a person's body image, and her internalized images of appropriate or desirable breast size and shape. Societal ideals over breast size vary over time, but there exist many conceived ideas involving breasts and sexual attractiveness and identity across different cultures.

==Treatment==
The procedure to remedy micromastia is most commonly augmentation mammoplasty using [[breast implants]]. Other techniques available involve using muscle flap-based reconstructive surgery techniques ([[latissimus dorsi]] and [[rectus abdominus]] muscles), microsurgical reconstruction, or fat grafting.
