'''Lathyrism''' or '''neurolathyrism''' is a neurological disease of humans and domestic animals, caused by eating certain [[legumes]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Lathyrus]]''. This problem is mainly associated with ''[[Lathyrus sativus]]'' (also known as ''Grass pea'', ''Kesari Dhal'', ''Khesari Dhal'' or ''Almorta'') and to a lesser degree with ''[[Lathyrus cicera]]'', ''[[Lathyrus ochrus]]'' and ''[[Lathyrus clymenum]]''<ref>[http://www.itg.be/itg/DistanceLearning/LectureNotesVandenEndenE/47_Medical_problems_caused_by_plantsp11.htm "Medical problems caused by plants: Lathyrism"] at ''Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine'' online database</ref> containing the [[toxin]] [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|ODAP]]. The lathyrism resulting from the ingestion of ''[[Sweet pea|Lathyrus odoratus]]'' seeds (''sweet peas'') is often referred to as '''odoratism''' or [[osteolathyrism]], which is caused by a different toxin ([[beta-aminopropionitrile]]) that affects the linking of [[collagen]], a [[protein]] of [[connective tissue]]s.

==Symptoms==
The consumption of large quantities of ''Lathyrus'' grain containing high concentrations of the [[glutamate]] analogue neurotoxin [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|β-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid]] (ODAP, also known as β-''N''-oxalyl-amino-L-alanine, or BOAA) causes paralysis, characterized by lack of strength in or inability to move the lower limbs. A unique symptom of lathyrism is the [[atrophy]] of [[gluteus|gluteal muscles]] (buttocks). ODAP is a poison of [[mitochondria]] leading to excess [[cell death]], especially in [[motor neurons]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Prevalence==
This disease is prevalent in some areas of [[Bangladesh]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]],<ref>{{cite journal

==Causes==

[[File:Beta-oxalylamino-L-alanine.svg|thumb|[[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid]]]]
The toxicological cause of the disease has been attributed to the [[neurotoxin]] [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|ODAP]] which acts as a structural analogue of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]]. Ingestion of legumes containing the toxin results mostly from ignorance of their toxicity and usually occurs where the despair of [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]] leaves few other food options. Lathyrism can also be caused by food [[adulteration]].

==Prevention==
Recent research suggests that sulfur [[amino acid]]s have a protective effect against the toxicity of ODAP.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sriram K., Shankar S.K., Boyd M.R., Ravindranath V. | year = 1998 | title = Thiol Oxidation and Loss of Mitochondrial Complex I Precede Excitatory Amino Acid-Mediated Neurodegeneration | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 18 | issue = 24| pages = 10287–10296 | pmid = 9852566 }}</ref>

Food preparation is also an important factor. Toxic amino acids are readily soluble in water and can be leached. Bacterial ([[lactic acid]]) and fungal ([[tempeh]]) fermentation is useful to reduce ODAP content. Moist heat ([[boiling]], [[steaming]]) [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]]s [[Protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]]s which otherwise add to the toxic effect of raw grasspea through depletion of protective sulfur amino acids.

The underlying cause for excessive consumption of grasspea is a lack of alternative food sources. This is a consequence of [[poverty]] and political conflict. The prevention of lathyrism is therefore a [[socio-economic]] challenge.

==Historical occurrence==
The first mentioned intoxication goes back to ancient India and also [[Hippocrates]] mentions a neurological disorder 46 B.C. in Greece caused by Lathyrus seed.<ref>{{cite journal

During the [[Peninsular War|Spanish War of Independence]] against Napoleon, grasspea served as a famine food. This was the subject of one of [[Francisco de Goya]]'s famous aquatint prints titled ''Gracias a la Almorta'' ("Thanks to the Grasspea"), depicting poor people surviving on a porridge made from grasspea flour, one of them lying on the floor, already crippled by it.

During WWII, on the order of Colonel I. Murgescu, commandant of the [[Vapniarka]] camp in Transnistria, the detainees - most of them Jews - were fed nearly exclusively with fodder pea; consequently they got ill of "lathyrisms".<ref>The Holocaust in Romania Under the Antonescu Government by Marcu Rozen - http://isurvived.org/</ref>

In the film ''Ashes'' [English title] by [[Andrzej Wajda]] based on the novel ''[[The Ashes (film)|Popioly]]'' [Polish title] translated as ''Lost army'' [English title] by [[Stefan Żeromski]] spanning the period 1798–1812, a horse is poisoned by grain from a Spanish village.  The footage of the horse losing control of its hind legs suggests that it was fed with Almortas.

==Modern occurrence==
During the [[Spain under Franco#Isolation .281945–1953.29|post-war period]] in Spain, there were several outbreaks of lathyrism, caused by the shortage of food, which led people to consume excessive amounts of Almorta flour.<ref>http://www.historiacocina.com/gourmets/venenos/almortas.htm AZCOYTIA, Carlos (2006): "Historia de la Almorta or el veneno que llegó con el hambre tras la Guerra Civil Española". ''HistoriaCocina''</ref>

In Spain, a seed mixture known as comuña<ref>The etymological origin of this name is from "común" (''common'') in its meaning of mixture, referring to the mix of seeds obtained when cleaning the grain and which contaminate the main grain, generally wheat.</ref>  consisting of ''Lathyrus sativus'', ''L. cicera'', ''Vicia sativa'' and ''V. ervilia'' provides a potent mixture of toxic amino acids to poison monogastric (single stomached) animals. Particularly the toxin beta-cyanoalanine from seeds of ''V. sativa'' enhances the toxicity of such a mixture through its inhibition of sulfur amino acid metabolism [conversion of methionine to cysteine leading to excretion of cystathionine in urine] and hence depletion of protective reduced thiols. Its use for sheep does not pose any lathyrism problems if doses do not exceed 50 percent of the ration.<ref>{{cite book| title=Neglected crops 1492 from a different perspective| url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0646e/T0646E0q.htm | author=J.E.

==Related conditions==
A related disease has been identified and named [[osteolathyrism]], because it affects the bones and connecting tissues, instead of the nervous system. It is a skeletal disorder, caused by the toxin [[beta-aminopropionitrile]] (BAPN), and characterized by [[hernias]], [[aortic dissection]], [[exostoses]], and [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome|kyphoscoliosis]] and other skeletal deformities, apparently as the result of defective aging of [[collagen]] [[Connective tissue|tissue]]. The cause of this disease is attributed to beta-aminopropionitrile, which inhibits the copper-containing [[enzyme]] [[lysyl oxidase]], responsible for cross-linking procollagen and proelastin. BAPN is also a [[metabolic product]] of a compound present in sprouts of grasspea, pea and lentils.<ref>COHN, D.F.
