Parsons.

==Biography==
Aaronson graduated summa cum laude from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1962, with a degree in [[chemistry]]. He earned his M.D. from the [[University of California, San Francisco Medical Center]] in 1966, and completed a fellowship at the [[School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge|University of Cambridge]] in [[England]] and an internship in medicine at Moffitt Hospital in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=MSH/>

In 1967, Aaronson joined the [[National Institutes of Health]] as a Senior Staff Fellow. He headed the Molecular Biology Section of the Viral Carcinogenesis Branch from 1970 until 1977, after which he became Chief of the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology at the [[National Cancer Institute]], until 1993, when he was named Chairman of Oncological Sciences at Mount Sinai Medical Center.

==Research==
Aaronson's early research established the transformation-competent but replication-defective nature of mammalian [[sarcoma]] viruses and molecularly cloned many of their [[oncogene]]s.<ref name=MSH/><ref name=BFSCI>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackfamilystemcell.org/BFSCIresearch.html+ |title=The Black Family Stem Cell Institute |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref> His investigations of the v-sis oncogene established the first normal function of an oncogene and its role in growth factor signaling.<ref name=ACGT/><ref name=BCRF/> His discovery of [[HER2/neu|erbB2]] as a v-erbB-related gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and the demonstration of its transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed against its product,<ref name=BFSCI/> and his successful isolation of [[Keratinocyte growth factor|KGF]] (FGF7), a growth factor present in the epithelialization-phase of wound healing, led to [[Amgen]]'s successful phase III [[clinical trial]] and [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] approval of KGF for treatment of [[mucositis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biocompare.com/ProductDetails/990070/Human-Keratinocyte-Growth-Factor-%28KGF%29.html |title=Human Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF) from GenWay Biotech, Inc. - Biocompare |work= |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1887355 |title=Keratinocyte growth factor is a growth factor for mammary epithelium in vivo.
