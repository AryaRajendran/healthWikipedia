The '''health effects of [[honey]]''' have long been noted by humans.  The nutritional and medicinal qualities of honey have been documented  in  [[Vedic]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Christian]], [[Islamic]] and other texts. Physicians of ancient times, such as [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), [[Aristoxenus]] (320 BC) [[Hippocrates]], [[Porphyry]], [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Cornelius Celsus]] (early first century AD) and [[Dioscorides]] (c. 50 AD), and Arab physicians  have referred to the healing qualities of honey.

Though scientific arguments have been made for use of honey in modern times, its use is still considered part of [[alternative medicine]].<ref name=Manuka>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manuka-honey.eu/id4.html|title=History of Honey as Medicine|accessdate=30 January 2011|publisher=Manuka Honey Research}}</ref><ref name=Value>{{Cite web|url=http://www.honey-health.com/honey-14.shtml|title=Medicinal Value of Honey|accessdate= 30 January 2011|publisher=Honey Health.com}}</ref>   Honey contains powerful [[antioxidant]]s with antiseptic and [[antibacterial]] properties. 

==History==
[[File:Bee-apis.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Honey bee]]]]
In the earliest [[Hindu]] [[Vedic]] texts, honey and its evolution are described elaborately. It is used as a metaphor to describe the [[Sun]] as [[honeycomb]]. The [[honeybee]]s incubate in the cells to form honey, which is called “the nectar of the Sun”.<ref name="Olivelle2005">{{cite book|first=Patrick |last=Olivelle|title=Language, texts, and society: explorations in ancient Indian culture and religion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KmAAtS8HslQC&pg=PA68|accessdate=29 January 2011|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Firenze University Press|isbn=978-88-8453-395-1|pages=68–}}</ref> Another metaphor states that the four [[Vedas]], the [[Hindu scriptures]], are represented by the honeycomb which is stated to be "sweet, beautiful, golden like the Sun". It is also described as a "blend of all the Nectars of many flowers." The knowledge of honey represents "oneness of everything." In [[Hindu rituals]], honey is one of the five ingredients of Panchamrit "the five [[Nectars]]", the other four are the [[ghee]], [[milk]], [[sugar]] and [[buttermilk]].<ref name="OldroydWongsiri2006">{{cite book|first1=Benjamin P. |last1=Oldroyd|first2=Siriwat |last2=Wongsiri|title=Asian honey bees: biology, conservation, and human interactions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A2aN1afJp44C&pg=PA224|accessdate=29 January 2011|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02194-5|pages=224–}}</ref> Honey has been used in [[Ayurveda]] medicine in India for at least 4000 years and is considered to affect positively in all three primitive material imbalances of the body. In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, within specific bee species, curative honey is categorised under eight distinct types. Overall, more than 634 remedies with honey as an ingredient have been propounded to tackle a wide range of health problems and many of them are said to be of complex formulation. A popular concoction to cure intestinal worms is that of honey with juice of [[Parrot Tree]] (''[[Butea monosperma]]'') fruit (called ''palash'' in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]).<ref name="Altman2010"/>

Honey has also been used by humans since pre-Ancient [[Egypt]]ian times<ref name="Altmanp3">Altman (2010), p.3</ref> to treat a variety of ailments through topical application, but only recently have the antiseptic and antibacterial properties of honey been chemically explained. Ancient Egyptian physicians used honey in medicinal compounds 5,000 years ago and the ancient [[Greeks]] believed that honey could promote virility and longevity.<ref name="Altmanp2">Altman (2010), p.2</ref> Honey has been used in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] for thousands of years and is still important today.<ref name="Altmanp2"/> Ancient Russian manuscripts attributed great importance to honey as a medicine.

From [[Biblical]] times, "milk and honey" have been said to denote fertility.<ref name="MalenaMiano2007">{{cite book|first1=Sarah |last1=Malena|first2=David |last2=Miano|title=Milk and honey: essays on ancient Israel and the Bible in appreciation of the Judaic Studies Program at the University of California, San Diego|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BW4wUQSxnjQC&pg=PR9|accessdate=29 January 2011|year=2007|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-127-6|page=ix}}</ref> Honey has been part of [[Baptism|baptismal ritual]] traced to about 100 AD.<ref name="Derrett1989">{{cite book|first=John Duncan |last=Martin Derrett|title=Studies in the New Testament: The Sea-Change of the Old Testament in the New|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xrFlVEn5ZPkC&pg=PA2|accessdate=29 January 2011|date=1 December 1989|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-09110-8|pages=2–}}</ref>

In ancient [[Islamic]] literature, honey bees have been extolled for their "intelligence, industry and creativity." The [[Quran]] mentions it as medicine to cure human illness. [[Prophet Mohammad]] himself spoke of the healing power of honey as a cure for all mental illness.<ref name="Altman2010">{{cite book|first=Nathaniel |last= Altman|title=The Honey Prescription: The Amazing Power of Honey As Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rmw-VE9NxqIC&pg=PA61|accessdate=29 January 2011|date=9 March 2010|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear & Company|isbn=978-1-59477-346-4|pages=60–62}}</ref>
In the later part of the 12th century, a Muslim physician described the healing powers of honey to disperse body fluids, soothing the bowels, curing dropsy, checking facial twitches, improving appetite, preventing the breakdown of muscles and preserving them.<ref name="Altman2010"/>

Honey can be traced to the [[Xin dynasty]] period of 2000 BC. One of the five medicinal qualities of honey was as a curative for [[insomnia]], practiced from the time of Li Zzen, [[Ming dynasty]] physician.<ref name="Altman2010"/> In 1000 BC, it was a [[Saxon]] [[herbal]] treatment for wounds, sties and amputated limbs. In 1446, it was used as a [[therapeutic drug]], in combination with [[alum]], to treat ulcers. And in 1623, it was used as an antiseptic and a mouthwash. The use of honey as a therapeutic cure in various combinations was popularised in [[Medieval Europe]], in particularly in [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Finland]], and [[Ireland]]. It was also extended to [[Ghana]], [[United States|USA]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Russia]], and Brazil. 

;Modern times
It was a gourmet medicine during the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913, healing the wounds of soldiers. Honey from several species of sting-less bees was consumed to cure [[flu]], to cure [[cataract]], [[glaucoma]] and [[cough]].<ref name="Altman2010, p. 62-67">Altman2010, pp. 62–67</ref> In modern times, its use as a healing agent is equally popular. In 2007, in the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' in England, the use of “manuka honey” in a large hospital in [[New Zealand]] to control [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) and other bacterial infections was noted; its antibacterial property to kill or inhibit is supported by many scientific studies in recent years.<ref name="Altman2010, p. 70-73">Altman2010, pp. 70–73</ref>

==Properties==
Scientists have revealed that honey has powerful anti-bacterial properties on at least sixty species of bacteria, and unlike antibiotics, which are often useless against certain types of bacteria, honey is non-toxic and has strong effects.<ref name="Altmanp3"/> 

The composition of honey includes sugars such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]] and also minerals such as [[magnesium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium chlorine]], [[sulphur]], [[iron]] and [[phosphate]]. Depending on the quality of the nectar and pollen, the vitamins contained in honey are B1, B2, C, B6, B5 and B3.<ref name=benefits>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bees-online.com/HealthBenefitsOfHoney.htm|title= Health Benefits Of Honey|accessdate=30 January 2011|publisher=Bees-Online:An Educational web site about Honey Bees and Beekeping}}</ref> 

The [[pH]] of honey is commonly between 3.2 and 4.5.<ref name="antimicrobial"/> This relatively acidic pH level prevents the growth of many bacteria. The non-peroxide antibiotic activity is due to [[methylglyoxal]] (MGO) and an unidentified synergistic component. Most honeys contain very low levels of MGO, but manuka honey contains very high levels. The presence of the synergist in manuka honey more than doubles MGO antibacterial activity.<ref name="manuka"/> Honey is primarily a saturated mixture of two [[monosaccharides]]. This mixture has a low [[water activity]]. Most of the water molecules are associated with the sugars and few remain available for microorganisms, so it is a poor environment for their growth. If water is mixed with honey, it loses its low water activity, and therefore, no longer possesses this antimicrobial property. [[Hydrogen peroxide]] is formed in a slow-release manner by the enzyme [[glucose oxidase]] present in honey. It becomes active only when honey is diluted, requires oxygen to be available for the reaction, thus it may not work under wound dressings, in wound cavities or in the gut. It is active only when the acidity of honey is neutralised by body fluids, it can be destroyed by the protein-digesting enzymes present in wound fluids, and is destroyed when honey is exposed to heat and light.<ref name="manuka"/> Honey [[chelation|chelates]] and deactivates free iron, which would otherwise catalyse the formation of oxygen [[free radicals]] from hydrogen peroxide, leading to inflammation. Also, the antioxidant constituents in honey help clean up oxygen free radicals.<ref>[http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2001/november/Molan/honey-as-topical-agent.html Honey as a topical antibacterial agent for treatment of infected wounds]</ref>

:[[Glucose|C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> → [[gluconic acid|C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]] + [[Hydrogen peroxide|H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]] (glucose oxidase reaction)

When honey is used topically, as, for example, a wound dressing, hydrogen peroxide is produced by dilution of the honey with body fluids. As a result, hydrogen peroxide is released slowly and acts as an antiseptic.

==Benefits==
The benefits of honey have been extolled since ancient times by many religious faiths and recorded in ancient scriptures. They can be categorised as nutritional or medicinal.<ref name=Value/>

===Nutritional===
Honey contains invert sugar that has the quality of providing instant energy when consumed. It is also a heart stimulant and a useful food supplement. As a food beverage, it was widely used from the times of "the Bible (both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s), the [[Talmud]], the Quran, the sacred books of India, China, [[Persia]] and Egypt." In the Bible, Salomon advocates "My son, eat thou honey, for it is good." According to the Bible, [[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]], the son of [[Saul]], "had his eyes enlightened with the aid of honey, after which he had a better understanding of the people than his father had. While Jonathan was passing through the woods during the war against the [[Philistines]], he found honey dripping on the ground; he plunged his spear into it, and ate enough to restore his lost strength. He was, however, sentenced to death because he ate honey on a day of [[abstinence]]".<ref name=Value/>

===Medicinal===
Medicinal benefits are broadly categorised under the following headings.
;Wounds
Topical honey has been used successfully in a treatment of [[chronic wound#Classification|diabetic ulcers]] when the patient cannot use topical antibiotics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/releases/13738 |title=Uw Study Tests Topical Honey As A Treatment For Diabetic Ulcer|accessdate=5 February 2011|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison|date= 5 February 2007}}</ref> A review in the Cochrane Library suggests that honey could reduce the time it takes for a burn to heal – up to four days sooner in some cases. The review included 19 studies with 2,554 participants. Although the honey treatment healed moderate burns faster than traditional dressings did, the author recommends viewing the findings with caution, since a single researcher performed all of the burn studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newswise.com/articles/view/544590/|title= Honey Holds Some Promise for Treating Burns|publisher= Newswise}}</ref> One New Zealand researcher says a particular type of honey (Manuka honey) may be useful in treating MRSA infections.<ref name="bbc healing">{{cite news |last = Knox |first = Angie| title = Harnessing honey's healing power|date = June 8, 2004 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3787867.stm |accessdate = 5 February 2011|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Antibacterial properties of honey are the result of the low [[water activity]] causing osmosis, [[hydrogen peroxide]] effect,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wahdan |first=H. |title=Causes of the antimicrobial activity of honey |journal=Infection |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=26–31 |year= 1998|pmid=9505176 |doi=10.1007/BF02768748}}</ref> high acidity,<ref name="antimicrobial">{{Cite book |title = Honey as an Antimicrobial Agent|date = November 16, 2006|publisher = Waikato Honey Research Unit |url = http://bio.waikato.ac.nz/honey/honey_intro.shtml|accessdate = 5 February 2007}}</ref> and the antibacterial activity of [[methylglyoxal]].<ref name="manuka">{{Cite web|url=http://bio.waikato.ac.nz/honey/special.shtml|title=Waikato Honey Research Unit:What's special about Active Manuka Honey?|accessdate=05-02-2011|publisher=The University of Waikato}}</ref> Some studies suggest that the topical use of honey may reduce odours, swelling, and scarring when used to treat wounds; it may also prevent the dressing from sticking to the healing wound.<ref name="antimicrobial"/> Wound gels that contain antibacterial raw honey and have regulatory approval for wound care are now available to help medicine in the battle against drug resistant strains of bacteria [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]. As an antimicrobial agent honey may have the potential for treating a variety of ailments.<ref name="Altman2010, p. 70-73"/> 

;Allergies
It is also stated to cure some allergies, particularly localized honey to an area could help minimize seasonal allergies as bees feed on pollen from local plants which eventually finds its way to form honey.<ref name=benefits/> Its use for centuries is as a treatment for sore throats and coughs, and according to recent research, may in fact be as effective as many common [[cough medicine]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/dec/04/health.medicalresearch|title=Honey 'beats cough medicine'|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=James|last=Randerson|date=December 4, 2007|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> Unfiltered, pasteurised honey is widely believed to alleviate allergies, though neither commercially filtered nor raw honey was shown to be more effective than [[placebo]] in a controlled study of 36 participants with [[Allergic conjunctivitis|ocular allergies]].<ref>{{Cite book |publisher = American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology |title = Studies of honey treatment effects on allergies |date = May 26, 2006 |url = http://www.aaaai.org/professionals/ask-the-expert/view.asp?id=6671 |accessdate = 5 February 2011}}</ref> Nearly 1 in 3 of the volunteers dropped out of the study because they could not tolerate eating one tablespoon of honey every day due to the overly sweet taste.<ref name="More, MD">{{Cite book|publisher = About.com Allergies|title = Does eating local honey help treat symptoms of allergies?

A more recent study has shown pollen collected by bees to exert an anti allergenic effect, mediated by an inhibition of IgE immunoglobulin binding to [[mast cells]].

;Other ailments
Antioxidants in honey have even been implicated in reducing damage to the colon in [[colitis]] in a study involving administering honey [[enema]]s to rats.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Bilsel |first = Y.|coauthors = D.

;Conditioning
Honey is used for skin conditioning using a moisturizing mask and can reduce facial redness and [[acne]]. It is also used for conditioning of hair. It is often mixed with [[olive oil]] or [[castor oil]] for both purposes.<ref name=benefits/>
