An '''iridectomy''', also known as a '''surgical iridectomy''' or '''corectomy''', is the [[surgery|surgical]] removal of part of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name="Cline">Cline D; Hofstetter HW; Griffin JR. ''Dictionary of Visual Science''. 4th ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston 1997.

Retrieved May 20, 2006.</ref> These procedures are most frequently performed in the treatment of [[closed-angle glaucoma]] and iris [[melanoma]].<ref name="Iridectomy"/>

==Comparison with Nd:YAG laser iridotomy==
In [[acute angle-closure glaucoma]] cases, surgical iridectomy has been superseded by [[Nd:YAG laser]] iridotomy, because the laser procedure is much safer. Opening the globe for a surgical iridectomy in a patient with high [[intraocular pressure]] greatly increases the risk of [[suprachoroidal hemorrhage]], with potential for associated [[expulsive hemorrhage]]. Nd:YAG laser iridotomy avoids such a catastrophe by laser created hole in the iris, which facilitates flow of [[aqueous humor]] from the posterior to the [[anterior chamber]] of the eye.

==Current indications==
Surgical iridectomy is commonly indicated and performed in the following cases:
* Cataract surgery in a glaucoma patient
* Combined procedure for cataract and glaucoma
* Acute closed-angle glaucoma
* Posterior capsular tears with vitreous loss
* Implantation of anterior chamber [[intraocular lens|IOL]].
* Vitreoretinal procedure involving injection of [[silicone oil]]. The location of the iridectomy in such cases is at 6'O Clock, as opposed to routine iridectomy done at 11 to 1'O Clock. This is because silicone oil is less dense than water.
* Iris trauma

==Types==
*An '''antiphogistic iridectomy''' is the surgical removal of part of the iris to reduce intraocular pressure in inflammatory conditions of the eye.<ref name="Cline"/>
*A '''basal iridectomy''' is an iridectomy which includes the root of the iris.<ref name="Cline"/>
*An '''optical iridectomy''' is the surgical removal of part of the iris to enlarge the existing pupil, or to form an artificial pupil, when the natural pupil is ineffectual.<ref name="Cline"/>
*A '''peripheral iridectomy''' is the surgical removal of a portion of the iris in the region of its root, leaving the pupillary margin and sphincter pupillae muscle intact.<ref name="Cline"/> It is used in the treatment of glaucoma.<ref name="Iridectomy"/>
*A '''preliminary iridectomy''', or '''preparatory iridectomy''', is the surgical removal of part of the iris preceding [[cataract extraction]].<ref name="Cline"/> It facilitates the removal of the [[cataract]]ous [[lens (anatomy)|lens]].<ref name="Iridectomy"/>
*A '''sector iridectomy''', also known as a '''complete iridectomy''' or '''total iridectomy''', is the surgical removal of a complete radial section of the iris extending from the pupillary margin to the root of the iris.<ref name="Cline"/> A ''key-hole pupil'' is left by the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris.<ref name="Cassin">Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. ''Dictionary of Eye Terminology''. Gainsville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990.</ref>
*A '''stenopeic iridectomy''' is the surgical removal of a narrow slit or a minute portion of the iris, leaving the sphincter pupillae muscle intact.<ref name="Cline"/>
*A '''therapeutic iridectomy''' is the surgical removal of a portion of the iris for the cure or prevention of an ocular disease.<ref name="Cline"/>
