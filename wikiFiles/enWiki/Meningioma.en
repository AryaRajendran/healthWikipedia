Symptomatic meningiomas are typically treated with either [[radiosurgery]] or [[craniotomy|conventional surgery]]. Historical evidence of meningiomas has been found going back hundreds of years, with some successful surgeries for their removal beginning in the 1800s.

==History and nomenclature==
The neoplasms currently referred to as meningiomas were referred to with a wide range of names in older medical literature, depending on the source. Various descriptors included "fungoid tumors", "fungus of the dura mater", "epithelioma", "psammoma", "dural sarcoma", "dural endothelioma", "fibrosarcoma", "angioendothelioma", "arachnoidal fibroboastoma", "endotheliosis of the meninges", "meningeal fibroblastoma", "meningoblastoma", "mestothelioma of the meninges", "sarcoma of the dura", and others. The modern term of "meningioma" was first used by [[Harvey Cushing]] (1869–1939) in 1922, to describe a set of tumors that occur throughout the [[neuraxis]] (brain and spinal cord), but have various commonalities.<ref>Okonkwo et al. p. 5.</ref><ref name=prayson>Prayson, Richard A. "Pathology of Meningiomas". ''Meningiomas''. pp. 31&ndash;41.</ref> Charles Oberling then separated these into subtypes based on cell structure, and several other researchers over the years have defined dozens of different subtypes as well. In 1979, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) classified seven subtypes, upgraded in 2000 to a classification system with nine low-grade variants (grade I tumors) and three variants each of grade II and grade III meningiomas.<ref name=prayson/> The most common subtypes are Meningotheliomatous (63%), transitional or mixed-type (19%), fibrous (13%), and psammomatous (2%).<ref name=park/>

The earliest evidence of a probable meningioma is from a skull approximately 365,000 years old, which was found in Germany. Other probable examples have been discovered in other continents around the world, including North and South America, and Africa. The earliest written record of what was probably a meningioma is from the 1600s, when [[Felix Plater]] (1536–1614) of the [[University of Basel]] performed an autopsy on Sir Caspar Bonecurtius.<ref name=okonkwo/> Surgery for removal of meningiomas was first attempted in the 18th century, with the first successful surgery for removal of a meningioma performed in 1835 by Zanobi Pecchioli, Professor of Surgery at the [[University of Siena]].<ref>Mirimanoff. p. 18.</ref> Other notable meningioma researchers have been [[William Macewen]] (1848–1924), and [[William W. Keen]] (1837–1932).<ref name=okonkwo>Okonkwo et al. pp. 7&ndash;8.</ref> Medical science has continued to make dramatic improvements in meningioma research and treatment over the last century, both in terms of the surgical techniques for [[segmental resection|resection]] (removal) of the tumor, and related improvements in [[anesthesia]], [[antiseptic]] methods, techniques to control blood loss, and better ability to determine which tumors are and are not operable.<ref>DeMonte. ''Al-Mefty's Meningiomas''.</ref>

==Causes==
The causes of meningiomas are not well understood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meningioma/DS00901/DSECTION=causes|title=Meningioma|publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]]|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> Most cases are sporadic, appearing randomly, while some are [[family|familial]]. Persons who have undergone [[radiation]], especially to the [[scalp]], are more at risk for developing meningiomas, as are those who have suffered brain injury at some time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Longstreth, W.T. Jr., et al.|title=Epidemiology of intracranial Meningioma|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=April 5, 2012|journal=[[Cancer (journal)|Cancer]]|volume=72|issue=3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3%3C639::AID-CNCR2820720304%3E3.0.CO;2-P/pdf|doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3<639::AID-CNCR2820720304>3.0.CO;2-P}}</ref> Atomic bomb survivors from [[Hiroshima]] were more likely to develop meningiomas, with the incidence increasing the closer that they were to the site of the explosion. Dental x-rays increase the risk of meningioma, in particular for patients who had frequent dental x-rays in the past, when the x-ray dose of a dental x-ray was higher than in the present.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dental x-rays and risk of meningioma|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.26625/abstract|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> 

Patients with [[neurofibromatosis]] type 2 (NF-2) have a 50% chance of developing one or more meningiomas. Studies of cell phones have found no association between cell phone use and incidence of meningiomas.<ref name=park/><ref name="Rabin">{{cite journal |author=Rabin BM |title=Radiation-induced changes in the central nervous system and head and neck |journal=Radiographics |volume=16 |issue=5 |pes=1055–72 |pages=1055–72 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=8888390 |url=http://radiographics.rsnajnls.org/cgi/reprint/16/5/1055 |last2=Meyer |first2=JR |last3=Berlin |first3=JW |last4=Marymount |first4=MH |last5=Palka |first5=PS |last6=Russell |first6=EJ }}</ref>

Many individuals have meningiomas but remain asymptomatic (no symptoms) for their entire life, so the meningiomas are not discovered until after an autopsy. One to two percent of all autopsies reveal meningiomas that were unknown to the individuals during their lifetime, since there were never any symptoms. In the 1970s, tumors causing symptoms were discovered in 2 out of 100,000 people, while tumors discovered without causing symptoms occurred in 5.7 out of 100,000, for a total incidence of 7.7/100,000. With the advent of modern sophisticated imaging systems such as [[CT scans]], the discovery of asymptomatic meningiomas has tripled.  Meningiomas are more likely to appear in women than men, though when they appear in men, are more likely to be malignant. Meningiomas can appear at any age, but most commonly are noticed in men and women age 50 or older, with meningiomas becoming more likely with age. They have been observed in all cultures, Western and Eastern, in roughly the same proportion as other possible brain tumors.<ref name=park>Park, Bong Jin; Kim, Han Kyu; Sade, Burak; Lee, Joung H. "Epidemiology", ''Meningiomas'', pp. 11&ndash;13.</ref>

Ninety-two percent of meningiomas are benign, with 8% being either atypical or malignant.<ref name=park/>

===Genetic causes===
The most frequent genetic mutations (~50%) involved in meningiomas are inactivation mutations in the [[neurofibromatosis 2]] [[gene]] (merlin) on [[chromosome]] 22q.

Other possible genes/loci include:

==Signs and symptoms==
{{main|Brain tumor}}
Small tumors (e.g., < 2.0&nbsp;cm) are usually incidental findings at [[autopsy]] without having caused [[symptom]]s. Larger tumors can cause symptoms depending on the size and location.
*[[Focal seizure]]s may be caused by meningiomas that overlie the cerebrum.
*Progressive spastic weakness in legs and incontinence may be caused by tumors that overlie the parasagittal frontoparietal region.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
*Sylvian tumors may cause myriad motor, sensory, aphasic, and seizure symptoms, depending on the location.
*[[intracranial pressure#Increased ICP|Increased intracranial pressure]] eventually occurs, but is less frequent than in [[glioma]]s.
*[[Diplopia]] (Double vision) or uneven pupil size can be symptoms if related pressure causes a 3rd and/or 6th nerve palsy.

[[Image:Meningioma - brain invasion - high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a meningioma with brain invasion (WHO Grade II); the tumour (bottom/right of image) has the typical "pushing border" invasion into the cerebral cortex (top/left of image). [[HPS stain]]]]
Meningiomas arise from [[arachnoidal]] cells,<ref name="urlmoon.ouhsc.edu">{{cite web |url=http://moon.ouhsc.edu/kfung/jty1/Com/Com306-1-Diss.htm |title=moon.ouhsc.edu |work= |accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> most of which are near the vicinity of the [[venous sinuses]], and this is the site of greatest prevalence for meningioma formation. They are most frequently attached to the dura over the superior parasagittal surface of frontal and [[parietal lobe]]s, along the [http://radiology.casereports.net/index.php/rcr/article/viewArticle/357/718 sphenoid ridge], in the [[olfactory]] grooves, the sylvian region, superior [[cerebellum]] along the ''[[falx cerebri]]'', [[cerebellopontine angle]], and the [[spinal cord]]. The tumor is usually [[gray]], well-circumscribed, and takes on the form of space it occupies. They are usually dome-shaped, with the base lying on the [[dura mater|dura]].

===Locations===
* [[Parasagittal]]/[[Falx cerebri|falcine]] (25%)
* Convexity (surface of the brain) (19%)
* [[Sphenoid ridge]] (17%)
* [[Suprasellar]] (9%)
* [[Posterior cranial fossa|Posterior fossa]] (8%)
* [[Olfactory groove]] (8%)
* [[Middle fossa]]/[[Meckel's cave]] (4%)
* [[Tentorial]] (3%)
* [[Peri-torcular]] (3%)

Other uncommon locations are the [[Lateral ventricle]], [[Foramen magnum]], and the orbit/optic nerve sheath.<ref name=park/> Meningiomas can also occur as a [[spinal tumor]], more often in women than in men, which occurs more often in Western countries than Asian.

Histologically, meningioma cells are relatively uniform, with a tendency to encircle one another, forming whorls and [[psammoma body|psammoma bodies]] (laminated calcific concretions).<ref name="urlNeuropathology For Medical Students">{{cite web |url=http://www.pathology.vcu.edu/WirSelfInst/neuro_medStudents/tumor-1.html |title=Neuropathology For Medical Students |work= |accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> They have a tendency to calcify and are highly vascularized.

Meningiomas are often considered benign tumors curable by [[surgery]], but most recurrent meningiomas correspond to histologic benign tumors. The metabolic [[phenotype]] of these benign recurrent meningiomas indicated an aggressive [[metabolism]] resembling that observed for atypical meningioma.<ref name="monleon">{{cite journal | author = Monleón D, Morales JM, Gonzalez-Segura A, Gonzalez-Darder JM, Gil-Benso R, Cerdá-Nicolás M, López-Ginés C | title = Metabolic aggressiveness in benign meningiomas with chromosomal instabilities | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 70 | issue = 21 | pages = 8426–8434 | year = 2010 | month = November | pmid = 20861191 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1498| url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/70/21/8426.long| accessdate = }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Menigioma.PNG|thumb|A meningioma that had previously been operated on with surrounding edema, ]]
Meningiomas are readily visualized with contrast [[Computed tomography|CT]], [[MRI]] with [[gadolinium]],<ref>{{Radiopaedia|Meningioma}}</ref> and arteriography, all attributed to the fact that meningiomas are extra-axial and vascularized. CSF protein is usually elevated if [[lumbar puncture]] is attempted.

Though the majority of meningiomas are benign, they can have malignant presentations.  Classification of meningiomas are based upon the WHO classification system.<ref name="pmid15540215">{{cite journal |author=Wrobel G, Roerig P, Kokocinski F, ''et al.'' |title=Microarray-based gene expression profiling of benign, atypical and anaplastic meningiomas identifies novel genes associated with meningioma progression |journal=Int. J. Cancer |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=249–56 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15540215 |doi=10.1002/ijc.20733}}</ref>
*Benign (Grade I) – (90%) – meningothelial, fibrous, transitional, psammomatous, angioblastic (most aggressive)
*Atypical (Grade II) – (7%) – chordoid, clear cell, atypical (includes brain invasion)
*Anaplastic/malignant (Grade III) – (2%) – papillary, rhabdoid, anaplastic 
In a 2008 review of the latter two categories, atypical and anaplastic-meningioma cases, the mean overall survival for atypical meningiomas was found to be 11.9 years vs. 3.3 years for anaplastic meningiomas.  Mean relapse-free survival for atypical meningiomas was 11.5 years vs. 2.7 years for anaplastic meningiomas.<ref>Yang SY et al.: Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas: prognostic implications of clinicopathological features.  J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2008 May;79(5):574–80. Epub 2007 Aug 31.</ref>

Malignant anaplastic meningioma is an especially malignant tumor with aggressive behavior. Even if – by general rule – neoplasms of the nervous system (brain tumors) cannot metastasize into the body because of the [[blood–brain barrier]], anaplastic meningioma can. Although they are inside the cerebral cavity, they are located on the bloodside of the BBB, because meningiomas tend to connect themselves to blood vessels to feed. Cancerized cells can thus escape into the bloodstream, which is why meningiomas, when they metastasize, often turn up around the lungs. Anaplastic meningioma and [[hemangiopericytoma]] are difficult to distinguish even by pathological means as they look similar, especially if the first occurrence is a meningeal tumor, and both tumors occur in the same places (same types of tissue).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Treatment==

===Observation===
Observation with close imaging follow-up can be used in select cases if a meningioma is small and asymptomatic.  In a retrospective study on 43 patients, 63% of patients were found to have no growth on follow-up, and the 37% found to have growth grew at an average of 4&nbsp;mm / year.<ref>Herscovici Z, et al.: Natural history of conservatively treated meningiomas." Neurology. 2004 Sep 28;63(6):1133–4.</ref>  In this study, younger patients were found to have tumors that were more likely to grow on repeat imaging; thus are poorer candidates for observation. In another study, clinical outcomes were compared for 213 patients undergoing surgery vs. 351 patients under watchful observation.<ref>Yano S, Kuratsu J.: Indications for surgery in patients with asymptomatic meningiomas based on an extensive experience. J Neurosurgery. 2006 Oct 105(4):538–43.</ref> Only 6% of the conservatively treated patients later developed symptoms, while among the surgically treated patients, 5.6% developed persistent morbid condition, and 9.4% developed surgery-related morbid condition.

Observation is not recommended in tumors already causing symptoms.  Furthermore, close follow-up with imaging is required with an observation strategy to rule out an enlarging tumor.<ref>Olivero WC et al.: "The natural history and growth rate of asymptomatic meningiomas: a review of 60 patients." J Neurosurg. 1995 Aug;83(2):222–4</ref>

===Surgical resection===
Meningiomas can usually be surgically [[segmental resection|resected]] (partially removed) and result in a permanent cure if the tumor is superficial on the [[Dura mater|dural]] surface and easily accessible. Transarterial [[embolization]] has become a standard preoperative procedure in the preoperative management.<ref>http://www.aans.org/education/journal/neurosurgical/july03/15-1-10.pdf</ref> If invasion of the adjacent bone occurs, total removal is nearly impossible. It is rare for benign meningiomas to become [[malignant]].

The probability of a tumor recurring or growing after surgery can be estimated by comparing the tumor's WHO (World Health Organization) grade and by the extent of surgery by the Simpson Criteria.<ref>Simpson D.  "The recurrence of intracranial meningiomas after surgical treatment."  J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 1957 Feb;20(1):22–39.</ref>

|-
| Grade IV || subtotal resection || style="text-align:center;"|  40%
|}
</center>

===Radiation therapy===
Radiation therapy may include photon-beam or proton-beam treatment, or [[Radiation therapy|fractionated external beam radiation]].  Radiosurgery can be used in lieu of surgery in small tumors located away from critical structures.<ref>Kullova A et al.: Radiosurgery for benign meningioma.  J Neurosurg. 2007 Aug;107(2):325–36.</ref> Fractionated external-beam radiation can also be used as primary treatment for tumors that are surgically unresectable, or for patients who are inoperable for medical reasons.

Radiation therapy is often considered for WHO grade I meningiomas after subtotal (incomplete) tumor resections.  The clinical decision to irradiate after a subtotal resection is somewhat controversial, as no class I randomized, controlled trials exist on the subject.<ref>Taylor BW et al.: The meningioma controversy: postoperative radiation therapy. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1988 Aug;15(2):299–304.</ref>  Numerous retrospective studies, however, have strongly suggested the addition of postoperative radiation to incomplete resections improves both progression-free survival (i.e. prevents tumor recurrence) and improves overall survival.<ref>Goldsmith BJ et al.: Postoperative irradiation for subtotally resected meningiomas. A retrospective analysis of 140 patients treated from 1967 to 1990. J Neurosurg. 1994 Feb;80(2):195–201.</ref>

In the case of a  grade III meningioma, the current standard of care involves postoperative radiation treatment regardless of the degree of surgical resection.<ref>Goyal LK et al. "Local control and overall survival in atypical meningioma: a retrospective study," Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jan 1;46(1):57–61.</ref>  This is due to the proportionally higher rate of local recurrence for these higher-grade tumors.  Grade II tumors can behave variably and there is no standard of whether to give radiotherapy following a gross total resection.  Subtotally resected grade II tumors should be radiated.

===Conventional chemotherapy===
Current chemotherapies are likely not effective. [[Antiprogestin]] agents have been used, but with variable results.<ref>Wahab M et al.: Meningioma and hormonal influences. Climacteric. 2003 Dec;6(4):285–92.</ref> A 2007 study that [[hydroxyurea]] has the capacity to shrink unresectable or recurrent meningiomas is being further evaluated.<ref>Newton HB. Hydroxyurea chemotherapy in the treatment of meningiomas. Neurosurg Focus. 2007;23(4):E11.</ref>
