A '''polypill''' is a [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]] that is a drug product in pill form (i.e., tablet or capsule) that ''combines'' multiple '''active pharmaceutical ingredients'''. The prefix "poly" means "multiple," referring to the multiplicity of distinct drugs in a given "pill."  An occasional synonym is ''combopill''.  It is commonly manufactured as a [[fixed-dose combination]] (FDC) drug product targeting treatment or prevention of chronic disease.<ref>http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/83/12/news11205/en/index.html</ref>  Polypills may be aimed to be consumed by healthy people as a means of [[preventive medicine]], and/or treating actual pathophysiological condition(s), the former typically involving lower dosages than the latter.  Polypills can reduce the number of [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] or [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] (generally [[Oral administration|orally administered]]) that need to be taken, which in turn may facilitate handling and administration of pharmaceuticals as well as alleviate patient pill-burden.  Sometimes the multiple drugs in a given polypill might all be aimed at a single underlying condition (or, group of related conditions), partly because this expands the pool of potential patients for whom a given combination of drugs/dosages might be appropriate (particularly in the case of mass-produced polypills, i.e. FDCs). The term polypill was first coined in the context of [[cardiovascular disease]] prevention,<ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Polypill</ref><ref name="pmid12829553">{{cite journal |author=Wald NJ, Law MR |title=A strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease by more than 80% |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7404 |pages=1419 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12829553 |pmc=162259 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7404.1419}}</ref> but has since gained broader acceptance, including now for combinatorial drug products that existed before the term was actually coined (as the bare term without any modifiers is now quite generic). 

In addition to the noted fixed-dose types of polypills, polypills can also be custom-made for specific patients through a process called [[pharmacy compounding]]. Physicians in most jurisdictions have wide discretion to prescribe customized drug products containing unique drug-dosage combinations (and/or formulations thereof) specifically for individual patients, which certain pharmacies can then sometimes produce for such patients.<ref>http://www.bayviewrx.com/bayview-blog/bid/18766/5-in-1-PolyPill-Treatment-May-Prevent-Heart-Disease</ref>

==For treatment or management of disease==

Polypills are a useful therapeutic tool for those afflicted with various diseases/conditions, by consolidating multiple medications into a single product and thereby simplifying medication administration for healthcare personnel as well as alleviating pill-burden for patients.  

HIV, mental-health, transplant, and certain other patient groups are known for especially high pill-burdens (whether temporary or indefinite).  Also, elderly patients in particular are likely to require several medications on a daily basis for managing multiple conditions, and they are also particularly susceptible to difficulties remembering or keeping track of their regimen.

===Origin of multi-drug pill usage===

Combinatorial drug products were proposed for ''treating'' diagnosed conditions long before they were proposed for preventative medicine, including "aspolol" (a combination of aspirin and [[atenolol]]) for those diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Fixed-dose combination (FDC) products today are also common for treating other diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[HIV/AIDS]]. 

===Developments in polypill usage for disease therapy===

====Treating diabetes and metabolic syndrome====

Polypills have been proposed for managing [[diabetes]] (and potentially for [[pre-diabetes]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuehn BM |title="Polypill" could slash diabetes risks |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=4 |pages=377–80 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16868284 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.4.377}}</ref>

[[Diabetes]] - particularly [[Type II diabetes]] - is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Diabetes also contributes substantially to cardiovascular risk, yet some ingredients appropriate for a cardiovascular polypill may not be advisable for patients with diabetes (such as [[beta-blockers]] and [[thiazide diuretics]]).  A polypill for diabetes could include a [[statin]] (to reduce [[LDL cholesterol]] and for their [[anti-inflammatory]] properties), an [[ACE inhibitor]] (for blood pressure control and to protect the [[kidneys]]), [[aspirin]] (for anti[[platelet]] and anti-inflammatory properties), and [[metformin]] (a medication for diabetes that is also associated with weight loss).

Relatedly, people who have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and/or are overweight can have [[metabolic syndrome]] X, and may be a candidate for an appropriate polypill - due to the quantity of different medications potentially involved.

====Role of compounding pharmacy====

As noted, not all polypills are mass-produced fixed-dose (FDC) drug products. Physicians in many countries have wide discretion to prescribe customized drug products containing unique drug-dosage combinations and/or formulations thereof specifically for individual patients, which can then be custom-produced in a [[compounding pharmacy]].  Some kinds or compositions of polypills or similar drug products are more amenable to custom-compounding than others, and most retail pharmacies no longer offer compounding services at all (although hospital pharmacies still commonly compound ''intravenous'' medications). But while fewer pharmacists are trained and experienced in the relevant skills anymore, especially regarding oral dosage forms, such compounding pharmacies nevertheless can be found and utilized via mail-order (if not available locally) with sufficient notice and planning.<ref>"5-in-1 PolyPill Treatment May Prevent Heart Disease". Bayviewrx.com. 2009-04-01. Retrieved 2012-02-05.</ref> Generally, if a customized drug product is produced for a specific patient in response to a prescription specifying said patient's drug(s)/dosage(s), it is ''not'' subject to regulatory approval (e.g., FDA in the US) but is instead regulated under the practice of pharmacy (governed at the state-level in the US).

Technologies are under development to facilitate production of customized polypills, such as for example by the use of ink-jet printing mechanisms to precisely deposit selected drug substance(s) onto sheets which can then be inserted into capsules (enabling "individualized dosing and automated fabrication of medicines containing multiple drugs," in addition to custom single-drug products).<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21360709</ref> Similar technology can also be used to print tablets, more directly. Ink-jet or fluid-jet approaches do require each drug substance to be dissolved in a liquid solvent, but they can be particularly conducive to custom formulation with various possible excipients (in addition to custom drug/dose selections).

==For preventative medicine==

===Origin of preventative medicine applications===
[[Nicholas Wald|Wald]] and [[Malcolm Law|Law]] had first proposed using a combination of well-known and inexpensive medications in one pill for protection against cardiovascular disease.<ref name="pmid12829553"/> They presented a [[statistical model]] which suggested widespread use of such a polypill could reduce mortality due to [[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]s by up to 80%, while the drugs and their respective interactions are already fairly well known and understood due to many years of being prescribed together (via separate pills). They proposed combining six medications already established in treating [[cardiovascular disease]] and associated conditions, providing these in a single pill to people in Western countries aged 55 years or more as a preventative measure (albeit in lower doses than when used for treatment).<ref name="pmid12829553"/> 

===Developments of preventative medicine applications===

Notably, any physician could currently prescribe all the components of many proposed polypills separately for her/his patients, whether therapeutically or preventatively.  And since the ingredients of many possible polypills are off [[patent]], it can be cheap to commercialize, although FDC products with novel combinations or formulations can sometimes themselves be patented.  Of course, for any FDC product, the potential market for a given combination of drugs/dosages would need to be sufficiently large to justify the clinical trials and other expenses associated with mass-producing a new drug.

Certain "cardiovascular polypills" are currently available in India and have been extensively studied there (see [[Polycap]] and [[PolyIran]], for a prominent example). Also, cardiologists in Spain are developing a polypill for secondary cardiovascular prevention.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sanz G, Fuster V |title=Fixed-dose combination therapy and secondary cardiovascular prevention: rationale, selection of drugs and target population |journal=Nat Clin Pract Cardiovasc Med |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=101–10 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19104519 |doi=10.1038/ncpcardio1419}}</ref>

====Preventative use rationale: Treatment of population risk====
Some preventative-use advocates propose that everyone over a given age (e.g., 55) should take such medications for preventative health, irrespective of individual risk factor levels. The idea is that most people in western countries are at high overall risk, thus lowering risk factor levels will provide broad benefit. This approach emphasizes the perspective that risk factors are continuous, and rigid dichotomies such as "hypertension" and "no hypertension" may be over-simplified and can be viewed instead as continuums of inter-connected factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Law MR, Wald NJ |title=Risk factor thresholds: their existence under scrutiny |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7353 |pages=1570–6 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12089098 |pmc=1123506 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7353.1570}}</ref>  

In this paradigm, doctors would in effect be treating population risk rather than individual risk factor thresholds as is current mainstream practice. So, if everyone were given a relevant kind of polypill, the average blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the population would fall, thus reducing overall population risk. Perhaps ironically, this is in a sense going in the ''opposite'' direction from [[personalized medicine]], since mass-produced or fixed-dose-combination polypills are in some tension with the goals of personalized medicine, due to the "fixed" nature of the "dose combinations." Proponents of this population-focused approach contend that the advantages of drug consolidation can outweigh any reduction in personalization of drug and/or dose selection. Also, depending on the demographic distribution and market size, there may be room for some different alternative versions of certain general FDCs to be manufactured with differences in their respective dosages and/or drugs. A widely-distributed polypill could contain three blood pressure medications at low dose: a [[diuretic]], such as [[hydrochlorothiazide]], a [[beta-blocker]] such as [[atenolol]], and an [[ACE inhibitor]] such as [[lisinopril]]; and these could be combined with a [[statin]] such as [[simvastatin]], [[aspirin]] at a dose of 75&nbsp;mg, and [[folic acid]] which has been shown to reduce the level of homocysteine in the blood which is another risk factor for heart disease.

In addition to public health motivations, proponents of a population-focused of approach also suggest that substantial cost savings could result for the health care system due to disease prevention or delay, and indirectly to the economy due to less productivity loss, etc.
