'''Accessory breasts''', also known as '''polymastia''', '''supernumerary breasts''', '''multiple breast syndrome''', or '''mammae erraticae''', is the condition of having an [[supernumerary body part|additional]] [[breast]].  Extra breasts may appear with or without [[nipple]]s or [[areola]]e. It is a condition and a form of [[atavism]] which is most prevalent in male humans, and often goes untreated as it is mostly harmless. In recent years, many affected women have had a [[plastic surgery]] operation to remove the additional breasts, for purely [[aesthetic]] reasons. 

A related condition, in which extra nipples form, is called "[[supernumerary nipple]]" or "polythelia".

==Presentation==
In some cases, the accessory breast may not be visible at the surface. In these cases, it may be possible to distinguish their appearance from normal breast tissue with [[MRI]].<ref name="pmid15547228">{{cite journal |author=Laor T, Collins MH, Emery KH, Donnelly LF, Bove KE, Ballard ET |title=MRI appearance of accessory breast tissue: a diagnostic consideration for an axillary mass in a peripubertal or pubertal girl |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=183 |issue=6 |pages=1779–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15547228 |doi=}}</ref>  In other cases, accessory breasts have been known to lactate, as illustrated in a woodcut showing a child nursing at ectopic breast tissue on the lateral thigh.<ref>{{cite journal

There is some evidence that the condition may be more common in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] populations.<ref name="pmid16547633">{{cite journal |author=Emsen IM |title=Treatment with ultrasound-assisted liposuction of accessory axillary breast tissues |journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=251–2 |year=2006 |pmid=16547633 |doi=10.1007/s00266-005-0160-7}}</ref>

==In fiction==
Some [[science fiction]] and [[comedy]] films have featured minor female characters with one or more additional breasts: ''[[The Warrior and the Sorceress]]'' (four breasts); ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (three breasts); ''[[Star Trek V]]'' (three breasts); ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' (four breasts); ''[[Firecracker (film)|Firecracker]]'' (three breasts); ''[[Flesh Gordon 2]]'' (more than four breasts, but just on a sign); ''[[Good Luck Chuck]]'' (three breasts); ''[[Dumb and Dumberer]]'' (three breasts);  ''[[Silence of the Hams]]'' (three breasts); ''[[Necropolis (film)|Necropolis]]'' (six breasts); ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'' (three breasts); and ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' (six breasts)(the Askajian).

''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series features many references to "Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six".
