An '''oncogene''' is a [[gene]] that has the potential to cause cancer.<ref name="Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes"> Wilbur, Beth, editor. The World of the Cell, Becker, W.M., et al., 7th ed. San Francisco, CA; 2009.</ref> In tumor cells, they are often [[mutated]] or expressed at high levels.<ref name="Kimball's Biology Pages">[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/O/Oncogenes.html Kimball's Biology Pages.] "Oncogenes" Free full text</ref> 

Most normal cells undergo a programmed form of death ([[apoptosis]]). Activated oncogenes can cause those cells that ought to die to survive and proliferate instead.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/illpres/implications.html The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2002.] Illustrated presentation.</ref> Most oncogenes require an additional step, such as mutations in another gene, or environmental factors, such as viral infection, to cause [[cancer]]. Since the 1970s, dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer.

==History==

The term "oncogene" was coined in 1969 by [[National Cancer Institute]] scientists, [[Robert Huebner]] and [[George Todaro]]<ref>[[The Emperor of All Maladies]], Siddhartha Mukherjee, 2011, p. 363, endnote.</ref>

The first confirmed oncogene was discovered in 1970 and was termed [[Src (gene)|src]] (pronounced ''sarc'' as in ''[[sarcoma]]'').  Src was in fact first discovered as an oncogene in a chicken retrovirus. Experiments performed by Dr [[G. Steve Martin]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] demonstrated that the Src was indeed the oncogene of the virus.  The first nucleotide sequence of v-src was sequenced 1980  by  A.P. Czernilofsky et al. <ref>(A.P. Czernilofsky et al., 1980, Nature Vol 287, pp 198-203).</ref>

In 1976 Drs. Dominique Stehelin, [[J. Michael Bishop]] and [[Harold E. Varmus]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] demonstrated that oncogenes were activated proto-oncogenes, found in many organisms including humans. For this discovery Bishop and Varmus were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1989.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1989/press.html Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1989 jointly to J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus for their discovery of "the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes".] Press Release.</ref>

== Proto-oncogene ==
A '''proto-oncogene''' is a normal gene that can become an oncogene due to mutations or increased [[Gene expression|expression]]. The resultant protein may be termed an '''oncoprotein'''.<ref name=Kumar20>Chapter 20 - NEOPLASMS OF THE THYROID - in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref> Proto-oncogenes code for [[protein]]s that help to regulate [[cell growth]] and [[cell differentiation|differentiation]]. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in [[signal transduction]] and execution of [[mitosis|mitogenic]] signals, usually through their [[protein]] products. Upon ''activation'', a proto-oncogene (or its product) becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Todd R, Wong DT |title=Oncogenes |journal=Anticancer Res. |volume=19 |issue=6A |pages=4729–46 |year=1999 |pmid=10697588}}</ref> Examples of proto-oncogenes include [[Ras (protein)|RAS]], [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT]], [[Myc|MYC]], [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]], and [[Trk receptor|TRK]]. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's Lymphoma, which starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the [[Bcr-Abl]] gene found on the Philadelphia Chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. (More information about the Philadelphia Chromosome below) 

=== Activation ===
[[Image:Ch1-oncogene.svg|right|thumb|From proto-oncogene to oncogene]]
The proto-oncogene can become an oncogene by a relatively small modification of its original function. There are three basic methods of activation:
#A [[mutation]] within a proto-oncogene, or within a regulatory region (for example the promoter region), can cause a change in the protein structure, causing
#* an increase in protein ([[enzyme]]) activity
#* a loss of [[Regulation of gene expression|regulation]]
# An increase in the amount of a certain protein (protein concentration), caused by
#* an increase of protein expression (through misregulation)
#* an increase of protein (mRNA) stability, prolonging its existence and thus its activity in the cell
#* [[gene duplication]] (one type of [[Chromosome abnormalities|chromosome abnormality]]), resulting in an increased amount of protein in the cell
# A [[chromosomal translocation]] (another type of [[Chromosome abnormalities|chromosome abnormality]])
#*There are 2 different types of chromosomal translocations that can occur:
##translocation events which relocate a proto-oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression
##translocation events that lead to a fusion between a proto-oncogene and a 2nd gene (this creates a fusion protein with increased cancerous/oncogenic activity)
##* the expression of a constitutively active ''hybrid protein''. This type of mutation in a dividing [[stem cell]] in the [[bone marrow]] leads to adult [[leukemia]]
##*Philadelphia Chromosome is an example of this type of translocation event.  This chromosome was discovered in 1960 by [[Peter Nowell]] and David Hungerford, and it is a fusion of parts of DNA from chromosome 22 and chromosome 9. The broken end of chromosome 22 contains the "BCR" gene, which fuses with a fragment of chromosome 9 that contains the "ABL1" gene.  When these two chromosome fragments fuse the genes also fuse creating a new gene: "BCR-ABL".  This fused gene encodes for a protein that displays high protein tyrosine kinase activity (this activity is due to the "ABL1" half of the protein). The unregulated expression of this protein activates other proteins that are involved in cell cycle and cell division which can cause a cell to grow and divide uncontrollably (the cell becomes cancerous).  As a result, the Philadelphia Chromosome is associated with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (as mentioned before) as well as other forms of Leukemia. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Chial|first=H|title=Proto-oncogenes to Oncogenes to Cancer|journal=Nature Education|year=2008|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> 

The expression of oncogenes can be regulated by [[microRNA]]s (miRNAs), small [[RNA]]s 21-25 nucleotides in length that control gene expression by [[downregulate|downregulating]] them.<ref name=Negrini>{{cite journal |author=Negrini M, Ferracin M, Sabbioni S, Croce CM |title=MicroRNAs in human cancer: from research to therapy |journal=J Cell Sci. |volume=120 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1833–40 |year=2007 |month=Jun |pmid=17515481 |doi=10.1242/jcs.03450 }}</ref> Mutations in such [[microRNAs]] (known as [[oncomir]]s) can lead to activation of oncogenes.<ref name="Esquela-Kerscher">{{cite journal |author=Esquela-Kerscher A, Slack FJ |title=Oncomirs - microRNAs with a role in cancer |journal=Nat Rev Cancer |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=259–69 |year=2006 |month=Apr |pmid=16557279 |doi=10.1038/nrc1840 }}</ref> [[Antisense]] messenger RNAs could theoretically be used to block the effects of oncogenes.

==Classification==
There are several systems for classifying oncogenes,<ref>[http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/oncogene.html#classes THE Medical Biochemistry Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.qub.ac.uk/cm/pat/education/Carcinogenesis/tsld014.htm Classification of Oncogene Function<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but there is not yet a widely accepted standard. They are sometimes grouped both spatially (moving from outside the cell inwards) and chronologically (parallelling the "normal" process of signal transduction). There are several categories that are commonly used:

More detailed information for the above '''Table''':
::*Growth factors are usually [[secretion|secreted]] by specialized cells to induce cell proliferation in themselves, nearby cells, or distant cells. An oncogene may cause a cell to secrete growth factors even though it does not normally do so. It will thereby induce its own uncontrolled proliferation (''[[autocrine loop]]''), and proliferation of neighboring cells. It may also cause production of growth hormones in other parts of the body.
::*Receptor Tyrosine [[Receptor tyrosine kinases|Kinases]] add phosphate groups to other proteins to turn them on or off. Receptor kinases add phosphate groups to receptor proteins at the surface of the cell (which receive protein signals from outside the cell and transmit them to the inside of the cell). Tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to the amino acid tyrosine in the target protein. They can cause cancer by turning the receptor permanently on (constitutively), even without signals from outside the cell.
::*Ras is a small GTPase that hydrolyses GTP into GDP and phosphate.  Ras is activated by growth factor signaling (i.e., EGF, TGFbeta) and acting like a binary switch (on/off) in growth signaling pathways.  Downstream effectors of Ras include Raf, MEK, MEKK, MAPK, ERK, most of which in turn regulate genes that mediate cell proliferation.
