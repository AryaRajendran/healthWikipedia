'''Thyroid nodules''' are lumps which commonly arise within an otherwise normal thyroid gland.<ref name="urlNew York Thyroid Center: Thyroid Nodules">{{cite web |url=http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/thyroid/nodules.html |title=New York Thyroid Center: Thyroid Nodules |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> They indicate a [[thyroid neoplasm]], but only a small percentage of these are [[thyroid cancer]]s.

==Presentation==
Often these abnormal growths of thyroid tissue are located at the edge of the thyroid gland so they can be felt as a lump in the throat. When they are large or when they occur in very thin individuals, they can even sometimes be seen as a lump in the front of the neck.

Sometimes a thyroid nodule presents as a fluid-filled cavity (called a thyroid cyst). Often, solid components are mixed with the fluid. Thyroid cysts most commonly result from degenerating [[thyroid adenoma]]s, which are benign, but they occasionally contain malignant solid components.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/thyroid-nodules/DS00491/DSECTION=causes mayoclinic.com > Thyroid nodules] Feb. 22, 2011</ref>

==Diagnosis==
After a [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]] is found during a physical examination, a referral to an [[endocrinologist]], a [[thyroidologist]] or [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologist]] may occur. Most commonly an [[ultrasound]] is performed to confirm the presence of a nodule, and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bennedbaek FN, Perrild H, Hegedüs L |title=Diagnosis and treatment of the solitary thyroid nodule.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common in young adults and children. Almost 50% of people have had one, but they are usually only detected by a GP during the course of a health examination, or through a different affliction.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Fine needle biopsy===
One approach used to determine whether the nodule is malignant is the [[fine needle biopsy]] (FNB),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ravetto C, Colombo L, Dottorini ME |title=Usefulness of fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma: a retrospective study in 37,895 patients |journal=Cancer |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=357–63 |year=2000 |pmid=11156519|doi=10.1002/1097-0142(20001225)90:6<357::AID-CNCR6>3.0.CO;2-4|url=  }}</ref> which some have described as the most cost-effective, sensitive and accurate test.<ref>

FNB or ultrasound-guided FNA usually yields sufficient thyroid cells to assess the risk of malignancy, although in some cases, the suspected nodule may need to be removed surgically for pathological examination.

===Blood tests===
Blood or imaging tests may be done prior to or in lieu of a biopsy. The possibility of a nodule which secretes thyroid hormone (which is less likely to be cancer) or hypothyroidism is investigated by measuring [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH), and the thyroid hormones [[thyroxine]] (T4) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T3).

Tests for serum thyroid [[antibodies|autoantibodies]] are sometimes done as these may indicate [[autoimmune]] thyroid disease (which can mimic nodular disease).

===Imaging===

The blood assays may be accompanied by [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] imaging of the nodule to determine the position, size and texture, and to assess whether the nodule may be [[cyst]]ic (fluid filled). Also suspicious findings in a nodule are [[hypoechoic]],<ref name="pmid16361145">{{cite journal |author=Wong KT, Ahuja AT |title=Ultrasound of thyroid cancer |journal=Cancer Imaging |volume=5 |issue= |pages=157–66 |year=2005 |pmid=16361145 |doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2005.0110}}</ref> irregular borders, [[microcalcification]]s, or very high levels of blood flow within the nodule. Less suspicious findings in benign nodules include, [[hyperechoic]], comet tail artifacts from [[colloid]],{{Clarify|date=September 2008}} no blood flow in the nodule and a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], or smooth border.

Nuclear medicine can be used to image the thyroid with radioactive [[technetium]] (Tc) or [[iodine]] (I) [[scintigraphy|imaging]] of the thyroid.<ref> Nuclear Medicine Thyroid Scan - MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003829.htm</ref> An <sup>123</sup>I scan showing a hot nodule, accompanied by a lower than normal TSH, is strong evidence that the nodule is not cancerous.

==Malignancy==
{{Main|Thyroid neoplasm}}
Only a small percentage of lumps in the neck are malignant, and most thyroid nodules are benign.

There are many factors to consider when diagnosing a malignant lump.

If the patient is a smoker, the chances of malignancy are considerably higher. When coupled with difficulty swallowing or breathing, this may be a symptom of a serious condition and requires speedy medical attention.

==Solitary thyroid nodule==
===Risks for cancer===
Solitary [[thyroid]] nodules are more common in females yet more worrisome in males.  Other associations with neoplastic nodules are family history of [[thyroid cancer]] and prior [[ionising radiation|radiation]] to the head and neck.

Radiation exposure to the head and neck may be for historic indications such as tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, "enlarged thymus", acne vulgaris, or current indications such as Hodgkin's lymphoma. Children living near the [[Chernobyl]] nuclear power plant during the catastrophe of 1986 have experienced a 60-fold increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer arising in the background of radiation is often multifocal with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis and has a poor prognosis.

===Signs and symptoms===
Worrisome sign and symptoms include voice hoarseness, rapid increase in size, compressive symptoms (such as dyspnoea or dysphagia) and appearance of [[lymphadenopathy]].

===Investigations===
*[[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] - A thyroid-stimulating hormone level should be obtained first.  If it is suppressed, then the nodule is likely a hyperfunctioning (or "hot") nodule.  These are rarely malignant.
*FNAC - fine [[Needle aspiration biopsy|needle aspiration cytology]] is the investigation of choice given a non-suppressed TSH. Repeat the FNAC in 6 months if the nodule enlarges.
*Imaging - [[Ultrasound]] and [[radioiodine]] scanning.

===Thyroid Scan===
:Cold - 85% of nodules are cold. 5-8% of cold and warm nodules are malignant.<ref>Gates JD, Benavides LC, Shriver CD, et al. Preoperative thyroid ultrasound in all patients undergoing parathyroidectomy?. J Surg Res. Dec 4 2008;[Medline].</ref>

:Hot - 5% of nodules are hot. Among these, 1% are malignant.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}}

===Surgery===
Surgery should be performed in the following instances
*Reaccumulation of the nodule despite 3-4 repeated FNACs
*Size in excess of 4&nbsp;cm in some cases
*Compressive symptoms
*Signs of malignancy (vocal cord dysfunction, lymphadenopathy)

Treatment

Medical treatment
Levothyroxine is a stereoisomer of thyroxine which is degraded much slower and can be administered once daily in patients with hypothyroidism.
