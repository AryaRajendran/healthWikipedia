An '''osteoma''' (plural: "osteomata") is a new piece of [[bone]] usually growing on another piece of bone, typically the [[human skull|skull]]. It is a [[benign]] [[tumor]].

When the bone tumor grows on other bone it is known as "homoplastic osteoma"; when it grows on other tissue it is called "heteroplastic osteoma".

Osteoma represents the most common benign [[neoplasm]] of the nose and [[paranasal sinuses]].  The cause of osteomata is uncertain, but commonly accepted theories propose embryologic, traumatic, or infectious causes.  Osteomata are also found in [[Gardner's syndrome]]. Larger craniofacial osteomata may cause facial pain, headache, and infection due to obstructed nasofrontal ducts.  Often, craniofacial osteoma presents itself through ocular signs and symptoms (such as [[proptosis]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Management of a Large Frontoethmoid Osteoma with Sinus Cranialization and Cranial Bone Graft Reconstruction |author=Michael S.
