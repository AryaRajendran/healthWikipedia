|quote=Do fingers and toes fall off when someone gets leprosy? No. The bacillus attacks nerve endings and destroys the body's ability to feel pain and injury. Without feeling pain, people injure themselves on fire, thorns, rocks, even hot coffee cups. Injuries become infected and result in tissue loss. Fingers and toes become shortened and deformed as the cartilage is absorbed into the body.

Effective treatment for leprosy appeared in the late 1930s with the introduction of [[dapsone]] and its derivatives. Leprosy [[Bacillus (shape)|bacilli]] resistant to dapsone soon [[Antibiotic resistance|evolved]] and, due to overuse of dapsone, became widespread. It was not until the introduction of multidrug therapy (MDT) in the early 1980s that the disease could be diagnosed and treated successfully within the community.<ref name="WHOleprosyFAQ">{{cite web| url=http://www.searo.who.int/en/section10/section373_11716.htm| title=Communicable Diseases Department, Leprosy FAQ | publisher=[[World Health Organization]]| date=2006-05-25 | accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>

MDT for multibacillary leprosy consists of [[rifampicin]], [[dapsone]], and [[clofazimine]] taken over 12 months. Dosages adjusted appropriately for children and adults are available in all [[Primary Health Centre|primary health centre]]s in the form of [[blister pack]]ages.<ref name="WHOleprosyFAQ" /> Single dose MDT for single lesion leprosy consists of [[rifampicin]], [[ofloxacin]], and [[minocycline]]. The move toward single-dose treatment strategies has reduced the prevalence of disease in some regions, since prevalence is dependent on duration of treatment. [[World Leprosy Day]] was created to draw awareness to leprosy and its sufferers.

==Classification==
[[File:Lepers, Tahiti (1898).jpg|thumb|Lepers in Tahiti, c. 1895]]
There are several ingenious different approaches for classifying leprosy; however, parallels exist.
* The [[World Health Organization]] system distinguishes "paucibacillary" and "multibacillary" based upon the proliferation of bacteria<ref>{{cite web |author=Smith DS | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/220455-overview |title=Leprosy: Overview | work=eMedicine Infectious Diseases |date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref> ("[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paucus#Latin pauci-]" refers to a low quantity.)

| Borderline leprosy is of intermediate severity and is the most common form. Skin lesions resemble tuberculoid leprosy but are more numerous and irregular; large patches may affect a whole limb, and peripheral nerve involvement with weakness and loss of sensation is common. This type is unstable and may become more like lepromatous leprosy or may undergo a reversal reaction, becoming more like the tuberculoid form.

The first symptom of leprosy which is most obvious is excess eye fluid.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis in the U.S. is often delayed because healthcare providers are unaware of leprosy and its symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment prevents nerve involvement, the hallmark of leprosy, and the disability it causes.<ref name="hrsa.gov">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration. (n.d.). National hansen's disease (leprosy) program Retrieved from http://www.hrsa.gov/hansens/</ref>

There are many kinds of leprosy but there are common symptoms, including: runny nose; dry scalp; eye problems; skin lesions; muscle weakness; reddish skin; smooth shiny diffuse thickening of facial skin, ear, and hand; loss of sensation in fingers and toes; thickening of peripheral nerves; and flat nose due to destruction of nasal cartilage. There is also phonation and resonation of sound during speech. Often there is atrophy of the testes and impotency.

==Cause==

===Mycobacterium leprae===
[[Image:M leprae ziehl nielsen2.jpg|thumb|right|''Mycobacterium leprae'', one of the causative agents of leprosy. As [[acid-fast]] bacteria, ''M. leprae'' appear red when a [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]] is used.]]
{{Main|Mycobacterium leprae}}

''Mycobacterium leprae'' and ''[[Mycobacterium lepromatosis]]'' are the causative agents of leprosy. ''M. lepromatosis'' is a relatively newly identified mycobacterium isolated from a fatal case of diffuse lepromatous leprosy in 2008.<ref name=new /><ref name=Sherris/>

An intracellular, [[acid-fast]] [[Bacteria|bacterium]], ''M. leprae'' is [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and rod-shaped, and is surrounded by the waxy [[cell membrane]] coating characteristic of ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' species.<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = McMurray DN | title = Mycobacteria and Nocardia. ''in:'' Baron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.1833 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 | oclc = 33838234 }}</ref>

Due to extensive loss of [[gene]]s necessary for independent growth, ''M. leprae'' and ''M. lepromatosis'' are obligate pathogens, and [[Microbiological culture|unculturable]] in the laboratory, a factor that leads to difficulty in definitively identifying the organism under a strict interpretation of [[Koch's postulates]].<ref name=new /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhattacharya S, Vijayalakshmi N, Parija SC |title=Uncultivable bacteria: Implications and recent trends towards identification |journal=Indian journal of medical microbiology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=174–7 |date=1 October 2002|pmid=17657065 |url=http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2002;volume=20;issue=4;spage=174;epage=177;aulast=Bhattacharya }}</ref> The use of non-culture-based techniques such as [[molecular genetics]] has allowed for alternative establishment of causation.

While the causative  organisms have to date been impossible to culture ''in vitro'', it has been possible to grow them in animals. Charles Shepard, chairman of the United States Leprosy Panel, successfully grew the organisms in the footpads of mice in 1960. This method was improved with the use of congenitally athymic mice ([[Nude mouse|nude mice]]) in 1970 by Joseph Colson and Richard Hilson at St George's Hospital, London.

A second animal model was developed by [[Eleanor E. Storrs]] at the [[Gulf South Research Institute]]. Dr Storrs had worked on the [[nine-banded armadillo]] for her PhD, because this animal had a lower body temperature than humans and might therefore be a suitable animal model.<ref>http://science.education.nih.gov/animalresearch.nsf/VWKeyResearchers1/Storrs</ref> The work started in 1968 with material provided by [[Waldemar F. Kirchheimer]] at the United States Public Health Leprosarium in [[Carville, Louisiana|Carville]], [[Louisiana]].<ref>http://www.leprosyhistory.org/cgi-bin/showdetails.pl?ID=119&type=Archive</ref> These experiments proved unsuccessful, but additional work in 1970 with material provided by Chapman H. Binford, medical director of the [[Leonard Wood Memorial]], was successful. The papers describing this model led to a dispute of priority. Further controversy was generated when it was discovered that wild armadillos in Louisiana were naturally infected with leprosy.

Naturally occurring infection also has been reported in non-human primates including the African chimpanzee, sooty mangabey, and cynomolgus macaque.

===Genetics===
It is believed that around 95% of people are naturally immune.<ref name="What is Leprosy">[http://www.leprosy.ca/Page.aspx?pid=245 What is Leprosy?], The Leprosy Mission Canada</ref><ref>[http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/disease/leprosy/leprosy1.html "Still a Mystery: Why Do Some People Get Leprosy?"], Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ref> Recent research suggests that there is a defect in cell-mediated immunity that causes susceptibility to Hansen's disease. The region of [[DNA]] responsible for this variability is also involved in [[Parkinson disease]], giving rise to current speculation that the two disorders may be linked in some way at the [[biochemistry|biochemical]] level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Buschman |first1=Ellen |last2=Skamene |first2=Emil |title=Linkage of leprosy susceptibility to Parkinson's disease genes |journal=International journal of leprosy and other mycobacterial diseases | volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=169–70 |year=2004 |month=Jun |issn=0148-916X |pmid=15301585 |doi= 10.1489/1544-581X(2004)072<0169:LOLSTP>2.0.CO;2|url=http://www.leprosy-ila.org/leprosyjournal/pdf/72/i0148-916X-72-2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Risk factors===
At highest risk are those living in endemic areas with poor conditions such as inadequate bedding, contaminated water, and insufficient diet, or other diseases that compromise immune function. 

Professional studies show little evidence that [[HIV]] is an important factor in increasing the risk of leprosy infection,<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1104977-clinical#a0218  Lewis, F.

===Transmission===
Although the mode of transmission of Hansen's disease remains uncertain, most investigators think that ''M. leprae'' is usually spread from person to person in respiratory droplets.<ref>City of Houston Government Center, Health and Human Services. (n.d.).

The minimum [[incubation period]] reported is as short as a few weeks, based on the very occasional occurrence of leprosy among young infants. The maximum incubation period reported is as long as 30 years, or over, as observed among war veterans known to have been exposed for short periods in endemic areas but otherwise living in non-endemic areas. It is generally agreed that the average incubation period is between three and five years.

==Pathophysiology==

Two exit routes of ''M. leprae'' from the human body often described are the skin and the nasal mucosa, although their relative importance is not clear. Lepromatous cases show large numbers of organisms deep in the [[dermis]], but whether they reach the skin surface in sufficient numbers is doubtful.<ref name="news-medical" /> Although there are reports of acid-fast bacilli being found in the desquamating [[epithelium]] (sloughing of superficial layer of skin) of the skin, Weddell ''et al.'' had reported in 1963 that they could not find any acid-fast bacilli in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], even after examining a very large number of specimens from patients and contacts.<ref name=Weddell_1963>{{cite journal |author=Weddell G, Palmer E |title=The pathogenesis of leprosy.

The entry route of ''M. leprae'' into the human body is also not definitively known: The skin and the upper respiratory tract are most likely. While older research dealt with the skin route, recent research has increasingly favored the respiratory route. Rees and McDougall succeeded in the experimental transmission of leprosy through aerosols containing ''M. leprae'' in immune-suppressed mice, suggesting a similar possibility in humans.<ref name=Rees_1977>{{cite journal |author=Rees R, McDougall A |title=Airborne infection with Mycobacterium leprae in mice |journal=J Med Microbiol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=63–8 |year=1977 |pmid=320339 |doi=10.1099/00222615-10-1-63}}</ref> Successful results have also been reported on experiments with [[Nude mouse|nude mice]] when ''M. leprae'' were introduced into the nasal cavity by topical application.<ref name=Chehl_1985>{{cite journal |author=Chehl S, Job C, Hastings R |title=Transmission of leprosy in nude mice |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1161–6 |year=1985 |pmid=3914846}}</ref> In summary, entry through the respiratory route appears the most probable route, although other routes, particularly broken skin, cannot be ruled out. The CDC notes the following assertion about the transmission of the disease: "''Although the mode of transmission of Hansen's disease remains uncertain, most investigators think that ''M. leprae'' is usually spread from person to person in respiratory droplets''."<ref name=CDC_2005>{{CDCDiseaseInfo|hansens_disease}} Hansen's Disease (Leprosy)</ref>

In leprosy, both the reference points for measuring the incubation period and the times of infection and onset of disease are difficult to define, the former because of the lack of adequate immunological tools and the latter because of the disease's slow onset. Even so, several investigators have attempted to measure the incubation period for leprosy. The minimum incubation period reported is as short as a few weeks and this is based on the very occasional occurrence of leprosy among young infants.<ref name=Montestruc_1954>{{cite journal |author=Montestruc E, Berdonneau R |title=2 New cases of leprosy in infants in Martinique |journal=Bull Soc Pathol Exot Filiales |volume=47 |issue=6 | language = French | pages=781–3 |year=1954 |pmid=14378912}}</ref> The maximum incubation period reported is as long as 30 years, or over, as observed among war veterans known to have been exposed for short periods in endemic areas but otherwise living in non-endemic areas. It is generally agreed that the average incubation period is between three and five years.

Efforts to overcome persistent obstacles to the elimination of the disease include improving detection, educating patients and the population about its cause, and fighting social taboos about a disease that has caused its patients throughout history to be considered "unclean" or "cursed by God" as outcasts. Leprosy is not a hereditary disease. Where taboos are strong, patients may be forced to hide their condition (and avoid seeking treatment) to avoid discrimination. The lack of awareness about Hansen's disease can lead people to believe (falsely) that the disease is highly contagious and incurable.

The [[ALERT (medical facility, Ethiopia)|ALERT]] hospital and research facility in Ethiopia provides training to medical personnel from around the world in the treatment of leprosy, as well as treating many local patients. Surgical techniques, such as for the restoration of control of movement of thumbs, have been developed.

==Treatment==
[[Image:MDTRegimens.jpg|thumb|MDT anti-leprosy drugs: standard regimens]]
Enough synthetic [[Leprostatic agent|pharmaceuticals that are effective against leprosy]] have by now been identified, and support a flexible choice of treatments. The WHO Study Group's report on the ''Chemotherapy of Leprosy'' in 1993 recommended two types of standard MDT regimen be adopted.<ref name=WHO_1993>{{cite web | title = Chemotherapy of Leprosy | work = WHO Technical Report Series 847 | publisher = WHO | year= 1994 | url = http://www.who.int/lep/mdt/chemotherapy/en/index.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}</ref> The first was a 24-month treatment for multibacillary (MB or lepromatous) cases using rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone. The second was a six-month treatment for paucibacillary (PB or tuberculoid) cases, using rifampicin and dapsone. At the First International Conference on the Elimination of Leprosy as a Public Health Problem, held in Hanoi the next year, the global strategy was endorsed and funds provided to WHO for the procurement and supply of MDT to all endemic countries.

{{Out of date|date=April 2011}}

Between 1995 and 1999, WHO, with the aid of the [[Nippon Foundation]] (Chairman [[Yōhei Sasakawa]], [[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador]] for Leprosy Elimination), supplied all endemic countries with free MDT in blister packs, channelled through Ministries of Health. This free provision was extended in 2000 and again in 2005 with donations by the MDT manufacturer [[Novartis]] through WHO. In the latest agreement signed between the company and WHO in October 2010, the provision of free MDT by WHO to all endemic countries will now run until at least the end of 2015. At the national level, [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organizations]] (NGOs) affiliated to the national programme will continue to be provided with an appropriate free supply of this WHO supplied MDT by the government.

MDT remains highly effective, and patients are no longer infectious after the first monthly dose.<ref name="WHO_Factsheet" /> It is safe and easy to use under field conditions due to its presentation in calendar blister packs.<ref name="WHO_Factsheet" /> [[Relapse]] rates remain low, and there is no known [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to the combined drugs.<ref name="WHO_Factsheet" /> The Seventh WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy,<ref name=WHO_1998>{{cite web | title = Seventh WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy| work = WHO Technical Report Series 874 | publisher = WHO | year= 1998 | url = http://www.who.int/lep/resources/expert/en/index.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}</ref> reporting in 1997, concluded that the MB duration of treatment — then standing at 24 months — could safely be shortened to 12 months "without significantly compromising its efficacy."

Worldwide, two to three million people are estimated to be permanently disabled because of leprosy.<ref name=WHO_1995 /> India has the greatest number of cases, with [[Brazil]] second and [[Myanmar]] third.

In 1999, the world [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of Hansen's disease was estimated to be 640,000. In 2000, 738,284 cases were identified.<ref name=Hawaii>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/22/health/main545392.shtml Last Days Of A Leper Colony]. CBC News. March 22, 2003.</ref> In 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) listed 91 countries in which Hansen's disease is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]]. India, [[Burma]], and [[Nepal]] contained 70% of cases. India reports over 50% of the world's leprosy cases.<ref>[http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/surgery-grants-for-leprosy-sufferers-in-india Surgery grants for leprosy sufferers in India]. Times of India. February 2, 2009.</ref> In 2002, 763,917 new cases were detected worldwide, and in that year the WHO listed [[Brazil]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Nepal]] as having 90% of Hansen's disease cases.

According to recent figures from the WHO, new cases detected worldwide have decreased by approximately 107,000 cases (or 21%) from 2003 to 2004. This decreasing trend has been consistent for the past three years. In addition, the global registered prevalence of HD was 286,063 cases; 407,791 new cases were detected during 2004.

In the United States, the first definite reference to the disease was in Florida in 1758. In 2004, there were 131 total cases of the disease in the United States.  Of the 131 cases, two-thirds were found to be males.  Also out of the 131 cases, 25 were of individuals who were born in the country, which amounts to 19%. Mexico (18.3%), Micronesia (11.5%), Brazil (9.2%), and the Philippines (7.6%) were the next leading countries where the victims of the disease were originally born.  A total of 20 cases were found to be white, not of Hispanic origin. As of October, 2005, 3,604 patients on the United States registry were currently receiving care.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brachman|first=Philip|coauthors=Abrutyn, Elias|title=Leprosy|journal=Bacterial infections of humans epidemiology and control|year=2009|pages=415–438|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r13443/#section=685179&page=1&locus=0|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> The disease is tracked by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), with a total of 166 new cases reported in the U.S. in 2005. Most (100 or 60%) of these new cases were reported in the following states; California, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas.<ref name="hrsa.gov"/>
Although the number of cases worldwide continues to fall, pockets of high prevalence continue in certain areas such as [[Brazil]], [[South Asia]] (India, [[Nepal]]), some parts of Africa ([[Tanzania]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]]), and the western Pacific.

===Disease burden===
Although annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] — the number of new leprosy cases occurring each year — is important as a measure of transmission, it is difficult to measure in leprosy due to its long incubation period, delays in diagnosis after onset of the disease, and the lack of laboratory tools to detect leprosy in its very early stages. Instead, the registered [[prevalence]] is used. Registered prevalence is a useful proxy indicator of the disease burden, as it reflects the number of active leprosy cases diagnosed with the disease and receiving treatment with MDT at a given point in time. The prevalence rate is defined as the number of cases registered for MDT treatment among the population in which the cases have occurred, again at a given point in time.<ref name=WHO_1985>{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization.|title=Epidemiology of leprosy in relation to control. Report of a WHO Study Group |journal=World Health Organ Tech Rep Ser |volume=716 |issue= |pages=1–60 |year=1985 |pmid=3925646 |isbn= 92-4-120716-7 |publisher= World Health Organization |location= Geneva |oclc= 12095109}}</ref>

New case detection is another indicator of the disease that is usually reported by countries on an annual basis. It includes cases diagnosed with onset of disease in the year in question (true incidence) and a large proportion of cases with onset in previous years (termed a backlog prevalence of undetected cases).

Endemic countries also report the number of new cases with established disabilities at the time of detection, as an indicator of the backlog prevalence. Determination of the time of onset of the disease is, in general, unreliable, is very labor-intensive, and is seldom done in recording these statistics.

As reported to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] by 115 countries and territories in 2006, and published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record, the global registered [[prevalence]] of leprosy at the beginning of the year was 219,826 cases.<ref name=WHO_2006>{{cite journal | author = | title = Global leprosy situation, 2006 | journal = Weekly Epidemiological Record | year = 2006 | volume = 81 | number = 32 | pages =309–16 |month=August |pmid=16903018 | url= http://www.who.int/lep/resources/wer8132.pdf|format=PDF | issue = 32}}</ref> New-case detection during the previous year (2005 - the last year for which full country information is available) was 296,499. The reason for the annual detections being higher than the prevalence at the end of the year can be explained by the fact that a proportion of new cases complete their treatment within the year and, therefore, no longer remain on the registers. The global detection of new cases continues to show a sharp decline, falling by 110,000 cases (27%) during 2005 compared with the previous year.

[[#tableWorldwide|Table 1]] shows that global annual detection has been declining since 2001. The African region reported an 8.7% decline in the number of new cases compared with 2004. The comparable figure for the Americas was 20.1%, for South-East Asia 32%, and for the Eastern Mediterranean 7.6%. The Western Pacific area, however, showed a 14.8% increase during the same period.

[[#tableToReachElimination|Table 2]] shows the leprosy situation in the four major countries that have yet to achieve the goal of elimination at the national level. It should be noted that: a) Elimination is defined as a prevalence of less than 1 case per 10,000 population; b) Madagascar reached elimination at the national level in September 2006; c) Nepal detection reported from mid-November 2004 to mid-November 2005; and d) D.R. Congo officially reported to WHO in 2008 that it had reached elimination by the end of 2007, at the national level.

After the end of the 17th century, [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[England]] were the countries in Western Europe where leprosy was a significant problem. During the 1830s, the number of lepers in Norway, Iceland and England rose rapidly, believed to be caused by frequent visits of sailors who visited Western India, causing an increase in medical research into the condition, and the disease became a political issue.

Hansen observed a number of nonrefractile small rods in unstained tissue sections. The rods were not soluble in potassium lye, and they were acid- and alcohol-fast. In 1879, he was able to stain these organisms with Ziehl's method and the similarities with Koch's bacillus (''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'') were noted. There were three significant differences between these organisms: (1) the rods in the leprosy lesions were extremely numerous, (2) they formed characteristic intracellular collections (''globii''), and (3) the rods had a variety of shapes with branching and swelling. These differences suggested that leprosy was caused by an organism related to but distinct from ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''.

He worked at ''St. Jørgens Hospital'' in [[Bergen]], founded early in the fifteenth century. St. Jørgens is now preserved as a museum, ''Lepramuseet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bymuseet.no/?vis=80 |title=Bymuseet i Bergen |publisher=Bymuseet.no |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref>

A common solution to the leper question across Europe and Asia from the 13th century lasting into the 20th century in some parts of the world was a leper asylum, commonly referred to as a leprosarium. These hospitals were oftentimes a voluntary reprieve from constant stigmatization as well as a source of medicine and healing. However, sometimes, particularly during 14th and 19th centuries when fear of leprosy was at a high point, admission to leprosariums was mandatory by all those diagnosed with or thought to have leprosy. 

When the fear of leprosy was rampant in societies across Europe and Asia there was also an associated rise in crime levels and overall dissatisfaction amongst the population. The leprosariums created during these times had multiple benefits: first, they provided treatment and safe living quarters for all lepers that were admitted; secondly, they eased tension amongst the healthy townspeople; and thirdly, they provided for a more stable populace for the authorities to govern.<ref name="Edmond, Rod 2006"/><ref>Leung, Angela Ki Che.

===Etymology===
The word ''leprosy'' comes from [[ancient Greek]] ''Λέπρα'' [léprā], "a disease that makes the skin scaly", in turn, a nominal derivation of the verb ''Λέπω'' [lépō], "to peel, scale off". ''Λέπος'' (Lepos) in ancient Greek means peel, or scale, so from ''Λέπος'' we have ''Λεπερός'' (''Λεπερός'' = who has peels - scales) --> and then ''Λεπρός'' (=leprous).<ref>Greek Dictionary Tegopoulos-Fytrakis, Athens, 1999</ref> The word came into the English language via Latin and old French. The first attested English use is in the ''Ancrene Wisse,'' a 13th-century manual for nuns ("Moyseses hond..bisemde o þe spitel uuel & þuhte lepruse." ''The Middle English Dictionary,'' s.v., "leprous"). A roughly contemporaneous use is attested in the Anglo-Norman ''Dialogues of Saint Gregory,'' "Esmondez i sont li lieprous" (''Anglo-Norman Dictionary,'' s.v., "leprus").

Throughout history, individuals with Hansen's disease have been known as lepers; however, this term is falling into disuse as a result of the diminishing number of leprosy patients. Because of the stigma to patients, some prefer not to use the word "leprosy," though the term is used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.<ref name="news-medical" /> Historically, the term ''[[Tzaraath]]'' from the [[Hebrew Bible]] was, accurately translated as leprosy, the symptoms of unclean version of Tzaraath were entirely consistent with leprosy. The first mention of leprosy recorded is found in Leviticus 13:2 - "When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests." There is also the well-known Bible story of the Syrian Naaman, "captain of the host of the king of Syria" (2 Kings 5:2), who apparently had the clean version of Leprosy, or skin disease, which would be manifest by his skin losing its pigment and becoming a Leprous white, in other words a clean leper. This form of Clean Leprosy as described in Leviticus 13:17 <ref name="kingjamesbibleonline.org">http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org</ref> is described as white skin without the scaly, or bright red or white spots that come along with the unclean version. The clean form of leprosy described upon Moses' hand in Exodus 4:6, 7 <ref name="kingjamesbibleonline.org"/> is what modernity has relabeled as Vitiligo, where the skin is void of Melanin. The reason this is not the unclean version is due to the way the unclean version is kept away from clothes, because if the unclean leprosy comes in contact with any clothes they must be burned due to its contagious properties as described in Leviticus 13:47-59,<ref name="kingjamesbibleonline.org"/> this was not the case with the miracle that was demonstrated upon Moses hand since he was not told afterwards to destroy his garments since it would be infected.     

In particular, [[tinea capitis]] ([[Fungus|fungal]] scalp infection) and related infections on other body parts caused by the [[dermatophyte]] fungus ''Trichophyton violaceum'' are abundant throughout the Middle East and North Africa today and might also have been common in biblical times. Likewise, the related agent of the disfiguring skin disease [[favus]] ''Trichophyton schoenleinii'' appears to have been common throughout Eurasia and Africa before the advent of modern medicine. Persons with severe favus and similar fungal diseases (and potentially also with severe [[psoriasis]] and other diseases not caused by microorganisms) tended to be classed as having leprosy as late as the 17th century in Europe.<ref name=Kane_1997>{{cite book | author = Kane J, Summerbell RC, Sigler L, Krajden S, Land G | title = Laboratory Handbook of Dermatophytes: A clinical guide and laboratory manual of dermatophytes and other filamentous fungi from skin, hair and nails | publisher = Star Publishers (Belmont, CA)|year = 1997|isbn = 0-89863-157-2|oclc = 37116438}}</ref> This is clearly shown in the painting ''The Regents of the Leper Hospital in Haarlem 1667'' by [[Jan de Bray]] ([[Frans Hals Museum]], [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands), where a young Dutchman with a vivid scalp infection, it is presumed caused by a fungus, is shown being cared for by three officials of a charitable home intended for leprosy sufferers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The use of the word "leprosy" before the mid-19th century, when microscopic examination of skin for medical diagnosis was first developed, can seldom be correlated reliably with Hansen's disease as we understand it today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Historical treatments===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}

The disease was known in Ancient Greece as elephantiasis (elephantiasis graecorum).
At various times blood was considered to be a treatment either as a [[beverage]] or as a[[bathing|bath]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} That of virgins or children was considered to be especially potent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This practice seems to have originated with the Ancient Egyptians but was also known in China. This practice persisted until at least 1790, when the use of [[dog]] blood was mentioned in ''De Secretis Naturae''. [[Paracelsus]] recommended the use of [[domestic sheep|lamb]]'s blood and even blood from dead bodies was used.

Snakes were also used, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]], and[[Theodorus Priscianus|Theodorus]]. [[Gaucher]] recommended treatment with [[cobra]] venom. [[Boinet]], in 1913, tried increasing doses of [[bee]] stings (up to 4000). [[Scorpion]]s and [[frog]]s were used occasionally instead of snakes. The excreta of ''[[Anabas]]'' (the climbing fish) was also tried.

Alternative treatments included scarification with or without the addition of irritants including[[arsenic]] and [[hellebore]]. [[Castration]] was also practiced in the Middle Ages.

A common pre-modern treatment of leprosy was [[Hydnocarpus wightiana|chaulmoogra oil]].

The oil has long been used in India as an Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of leprosy and various skin conditions. It has also been used in China and [[Burma]], and was introduced to the West by Frederic John Mouat, a professor at [[Bengal Medical College]]. He tried the oil as an oral and topical agent in two cases of leprosy and reported significant improvements in an 1854 paper.<ref>Indian Annals of Medical Science{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>

This paper caused some confusion. Mouat indicated that the oil was the product of a tree ''Chaulmoogra odorata'', which had been described in 1815 by [[William Roxburgh]], a surgeon and naturalist, while he was cataloging the plants in the [[East India Company]]’s botanical garden in [[Calcutta]]. This tree is also known as ''[[Gynocardia odorata]]''. For the rest of the 19th century, this tree was thought to be the source of the oil. In 1901, Sir [[David Prain]] identified the true chaulmoogra seeds of the Calcutta [[bazaar]] and of the Paris and London apothecaries as coming from ''[[Taraktogenos kurzii]]'', which is found in [[Burma]] and Northeast India. The oil mentioned in the Ayurvedic texts was from the tree ''[[Hydnocarpus wightiana]]'', known as ''Tuvakara'' in [[Sanskrit]] and ''chaulmugra'' in[[Hindi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].

The first parenteral administration was given by the Egyptian doctor [[Tortoulis Bey]], personal physician to the Sultan [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt]]. He had been using subcutaneous injections of[[creosote]] for tuberculosis and in 1894 administered subcutaneous injection of chaulmoogra oil in a 36-year-old [[Egypt]]ian [[Copt]] who had been unable to tolerate oral treatment. After 6 years and 584 injections, the patient was declared cured.

An early scientific analysis of the oil was carried out by [[Frederick B. Power]] in London in 1904. He and his colleagues isolated a new unsaturated fatty acid from the seeds, which they named 'chaulmoogric acid'. They also investigated two closely related species:  ''[[Hydnocarpus anthelmintica]]'' and''[[Hydnocarpus wightiana]]''. From these two trees they isolated both chaulmoogric acid and a closely related compound, 'hydnocarpus acid'. They also investigated ''Gynocardia odorata'' and found that it produced neither of these acids. Later investigation showed that 'taraktogenos' (''[[Hydnocarpus kurzii]]'') also produced chaulmoogric acid.

Another difficulty with the use of this oil was administration. Taken orally it is extremely nauseating. Given by enema may cause peri-anal ulcers and fissures. Given by injection the drug caused fever and other local reactions. Despite these difficulties, a series of 170 patients were reported in 1916 by[[Ralph Hopkins]], the attending physician at the [[Louisiana]] Leper Home in Carville, Louisiana. He divided the patients into two groups - 'incipient' and 'advanced'. In the advanced cases, 25% (at most) showed any improvement or arrest of their condition; in the incipient cases, 45% reported an improvement or stabilization of the disease (mortality rates were 4% and 8%, respectively). The remainder absconded from the Home apparently in improved condition.

Given the apparent usefulness of this agent, a search began for improved formulations. [[Victor Heiser]]the Chief Quarantine Officer and Director of Health for [[Manila]] and [[Elidoro Mercado]] the house physician at the [[San Lazaro Hospital]] for lepers in Manila decided to add [[camphor]] to a prescription of chaulmoogra and resorcin, which was typically given orally at the suggestion of [[Merck & Co.|Merck and Company]] in Germany to whom Heiser had written. They found that this new compound was readily absorbed without the nausea that had plagued the earlier preparations.

Heiser and Mercado in 1913 then administered the oil by injection to two patients who were cured of the disease. Since this treatment was administered in conjunction with other materials, the results were not clear. A further two patients were treated with the oil by injection without other treatments and again appeared to be cured of the disease. The following year, Heiser reported a further 12 patients but the results were mixed.

Less toxic injectable forms of this oil were then sought. Between 1920 and 1922, a series of papers were published describing the esters of these oils. These may have been based on the work of [[Alice Ball]]—the record is not clear on this point and Ms Ball died in 1916. Trials of these esters were carried out in 1921 and appeared to give useful results.

These attempts had been preceded by others. Merck of [[Darmstadt]] had produced a version of the sodium salts in 1891. They named this sodium gynocardate in the mistaken belief that the origin of the oil was''Gynocardia odorata''. [[Bayer]] in 1908 marketed a commercial version of the esters under the name 'Antileprol'.

To ensure a supply of this agent [[Joseph Rock]], Professor of Systematic Botany at the College of Hawaii, traveled to Burma. The local villagers located a grove of trees in seed, which he used to establish a plantation of 2,980 trees on the island of [[Oahu]], Hawaii between 1921 and 1922.

The oil remained a popular treatment despite the common side effects until the introduction of[[sulfone]]s in the 1940s. Debate about its efficacy continued until it was discontinued.

===Modern treatments===
[[Image:Blisters01.jpg|thumb|MDT patient packs and blisters]]
It has been said that [[Promin]] was first synthesised in 1940 by Feldman of [[Parke-Davis]] and company.<ref name=ravina2011evolution>{{cite book |author=Ravina, E. and Kubinyi, H.  |title=The Evolution of Drug Discovery: From Traditional Medicines to Modern Drugs |publisher=John Wiley \& Sons|year=2011 |page=80 |isbn=978-3-527-32669-3 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iDNy0XxGqT8C}}</ref> Although Parke-Davis did in fact synthesise the compound, it seems certain that they were not the first; in cooperation with J. Wittmann, [[Emil Fromm]] synthesised both dapsone and some of its derivatives, including promin, in 1908. He was however a chemist and not a medical worker, nor did anyone investigate its medical value until some decades afterwards.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wozel|first=Gottfried |title=The Story of Sulfones in Tropical Medicine and Dermatology|journal=International Journal of Dermatology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=17–21 |year=1989|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1989.tb01301.x }}</ref>

Until the introduction of treatment with promin in the 1940s, there was no effective treatment for leprosy. The efficacy of promin was first discovered by [[Guy Henry Faget]] and his co-workers in 1943 at Carville, Louisiana. In the 1950s [[dapsone]] was introduced to Carville by Dr. R.G. Cochrane. It is only weakly bactericidal against ''[[Mycobacterium leprae|M. leprae]]'' and it was considered necessary for patients to take the drug indefinitely. When dapsone was used alone, the ''M. leprae'' population quickly [[evolution|evolved]] [[antibiotic resistance]]; by the 1960s, the world's only known anti-leprosy drug became virtually useless.

The search for more effective anti-leprosy drugs led to the use of [[clofazimine]] and [[rifampicin]] in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=Rees_1970>{{cite journal | author= Rees RJ, Pearson JM, Waters MF|title=Experimental and Clinical Studies on Rifampicin in Treatment of Leprosy | journal=Br Med J|year=1970 | pages=89–92 | volume= 688 | issue= 1 | pmid=4903972 | doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.5688.89 | pmc= 1699176}}</ref> Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance.<ref name=Yawalkar_1982>{{cite journal | author=Yawalkar SJ, McDougall AC, Languillon J, Ghosh S, Hajra SK, Opromolla DV, Tonello CJ | title=Once-monthly rifampicin plus daily dapsone in initial treatment of lepromatous leprosy | journal=Lancet | year=1982 | pages=1199–1202 | volume= 8283 | issue= 1 |pmid = 6122970 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(82)92334-0}}</ref> The first trials of combined treatment were carried out in [[Malta]] in the 1970s.

Multidrug therapy (MDT) combining all three drugs was first recommended by a WHO Expert Committee in 1981. These three anti-leprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens. None of them is used alone because of the risk of developing resistance.

This treatment was quite expensive, and was not quickly adopted in most endemic countries. In 1985, leprosy was still considered a public health problem in 122 countries. The 44th World Health Assembly (WHA), held in Geneva in 1991, passed a resolution to eliminate leprosy as a public-health problem by the year 2000 — defined as reducing the global [[prevalence]] of the disease to less than 1 case per 10,000. At the Assembly, the World Health Organization (WHO) was given the mandate to develop an elimination strategy by its member states, based on increasing the geographical coverage of MDT and patients’ accessibility to the treatment.

The [[Persian people|Persian]] [[polymath]] [[Avicenna]] (c. 980–1037) was the first outside of China to describe the destruction of the [[nasal septum]] in those suffering from leprosy.<ref name="mcleod yates 152 153"/>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Leprosy bell.a.JPG|thumb|200px|Medieval leper bell]]
Numerous ''leprosaria'', or leper hospitals, sprang up in the Middle Ages; [[Matthew Paris]], a [[Benedictine|Benedictine Monk]], estimated that in the early thirteenth century there were 19,000 across Europe.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Leprosy}}</ref> The first recorded [[leprosarium|Leper colony]] was in [[Harbledown]], [[England]]. These institutions were run along monastic lines and, while lepers were encouraged to live in these monastic-type establishments, this was for their own health as well as quarantine. Indeed, some medieval sources indicate belief that those suffering from leprosy were considered to be going through [[Purgatory]] on Earth, and for this reason their suffering was considered holier than the ordinary person's. More frequently, lepers were seen to exist in a place between life and death: They were still alive, yet many chose or were forced to [[Separatio Leprosorum|ritually separate themselves]] from mundane existence.<ref>Brody, Saul Nathaniel (1974). The Disease of the Soul: Leprosy in Medieval Literature. Ithaca: Cornell Press.</ref> The [[Order of Saint Lazarus]] was a hospitaller and military order of monks that began as a leper hospital outside Jerusalem in the twelfth century and remained associated with leprosy throughout its history. The first monks in this order were leper knights, and they originally had leper grand masters, although these aspects of the order changed over the centuries.

[[Radegund]] was noted for washing the feet of lepers. [[Orderic Vitalis]] writes of a monk, Ralf, who was so overcome by the plight of lepers that he prayed to catch leprosy himself (which he eventually did). The leper would carry a clapper and bell to warn of his approach, and this was as much to attract attention for charity as to warn people that a diseased person was near.

Japan has had a unique history of segregation of patients into sanatoria based on leprosy prevention laws of 1907, 1931, and 1953, and, hence, it intensified [[leprosy stigma]]. The 1953 law was abrogated in 1996. There were still 2717 ex-patients in 13 national sanatoria and two private hospitals as of 2008. In a document written in 833, leprosy was described as "caused by a parasite that eats five organs of the body. The eyebrows and eyelashes come off, and the nose is deformed. The disease brings hoarseness, and necessitates amputations of the fingers and toes. Do not sleep with the patients, as the disease is transmittable to those nearby." This was the first document concerning infectivity.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ichiro |last=Kikuchi |title=Hansen's Disease in Japan: A Brief History |journal=International Journal of Dermatology |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=629–633 |year=1997 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-4362.1997.00230.x |pmid=9329899 }}</ref> Males admitted to leprosaria in Japan were sterilized and females found to be pregnant were forced to have abortions. These extreme actions were done to prevent children of diseased parents from being born lest they also contract the disease.

===Stigma in India===
[[File:Beggar with Leprosy.jpg|thumb|200px|A man with leprosy in India]]
Leprosy patients in India, like many parts of the world, suffer under some of the worst conditions and stereotypes about their disease.  Depending on the level of disfigurement a leper could receive harsher stigma and ostracism. Leprosy sufferers are markedly disadvantaged with respect to income with 16-44% of victims reporting a decrease in pay as a result of having leprosy. Women suffer greater restrictions and social stigma than men. Leprosy prevents mothers from getting too close to their children out of fear that they could infect them. In a report, 49% of women stopped breast-feeding their babies as a result of having leprosy. Doctors and other health care providers and NGOs are working hard to educate people about the disease. In one study when leprosy treatment and education were mixed in with the local healthcare program the attitudes towards the disease were somewhat alleviated as people had a better understanding of it. Now the disease prevalence has been reduced to less than 1 per million population in most parts of the country.<ref>Rafferty, Joy. "Curing the Stigma of Leprosy." Leprosy Review. 76 (2005): 119-126.

*In the world there are many leprosariums for asylum and treatment of leproses. Groups connected with the Catholic Church financially support and operate 547 of them (2013) according to the latest data of the Statistical Yearbook of the Church. Following is their distribution by continent. In Africa 198, in America (total) 56, in Asia 285, in Europe 5 and in Oceania 3. The nations where the largest number  of leprosarium are located are: in Africa: the Congo Democratic Republic (32), Madagascar (29), South Africa (23); in America: Mexico (8); in Central America-Antilles: the Dominican Republic (3); in Soth America: Brasil (17), Ecuador and Colombia (4); in Asia: India (220), Corea (15); in Oceania: Papua New Guinée (3) --- (Fides Agency News, January 26, 2013, 12:23).
