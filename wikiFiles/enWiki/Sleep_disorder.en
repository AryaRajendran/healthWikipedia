A '''sleep disorder''', or '''somnipathy''', is a [[medical disorder]] of the [[sleep]] patterns of a person or animal.  Some sleep disorders are serious enough to interfere with normal physical, mental and emotional functioning. [[Polysomnography]] is a test commonly ordered for some sleep disorders.

Disruptions in sleep can be caused by a variety of issues, from teeth grinding ([[bruxism]]) to [[night terror]]s.  When a person suffers from difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep with no obvious cause, it is referred to as [[insomnia]].<ref>{{Cite book|last= Hirshkowitz |first= Max |coauthors= |editor= Stuart C.

It is neither a disease nor a specific condition. (from p. 322) }}</ref> Dyssomnia refers to a group of sleep disorders with the symptoms of trouble falling asleep or maintaining sleep, which may cause an elevated sense of sleepiness during the day. Insomnia is characterized by an extended period of symptoms including trouble with retaining sleep, fatigue, decreased attentiveness, and dysphoria. To diagnose insomnia, these symptoms must persist for a minimum of 4 weeks. The [[DSM-IV]] categorizes insomnias into primary insomnia, insomnia associated with medical or mental diseases, and insomnia associated with the consumption or abuse of substances. Individuals with insomnia often worry about the negative health consequences, which can lead to the development of anxiety and depression.<ref>Voderholzer, U., Guilleminaultz, C. (2012). Sleep disorders. ''Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 106(3)'', 527-540.</ref> 

In addition, sleep disorders may also cause sufferers to sleep excessively, a condition known as [[hypersomnia]].  Management of sleep disturbances that are secondary to mental, medical, or substance abuse disorders should focus on the underlying conditions.

==Common disorders==
The most common sleep disorders include:
* Primary [[insomnia]]: Chronic difficulty in falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep when no other cause is found for these symptoms.
* [[Bruxism]]: Involuntarily grinding or clenching of the teeth while sleeping.
* [[Delayed sleep phase syndrome]] (DSPS): inability to awaken and fall asleep at socially acceptable times but no problem with sleep maintenance, a disorder of [[circadian rhythm]]s. (Other such disorders are [[advanced sleep phase syndrome]] (ASPS), [[non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome]] (Non-24), and [[irregular sleep wake rhythm]], all much less common than DSPS, as well as the transient [[jet lag]] and [[shift work sleep disorder]].)
* [[Hypopnea|Hypopnea syndrome]]: Abnormally shallow breathing or slow respiratory rate while sleeping.
* [[Narcolepsy]]: [[Excessive daytime sleepiness]] (EDS) often culminating in falling asleep spontaneously but unwillingly at inappropriate times.  Also often associated with [[cataplexy]], a sudden weakness in the motor muscles that can result in collapse to the floor.
* [[Idiopathic hypersomnia]]: a primary, neurologic hypersomnia, which shares many similarities with narcolepsy.
* [[Night terror]]: ''Pavor nocturnus'', sleep terror disorder: abrupt awakening from sleep with behavior consistent with [[fear|terror]].
* [[Parasomnia]]s: Disruptive sleep-related events involving inappropriate actions during sleep; sleep walking and night-terrors are examples.
* [[Periodic limb movement disorder]] (PLMD): Sudden involuntary movement of arms and/or legs during sleep, for example kicking the legs. Also known as [[nocturnal myoclonus]]. See also [[Hypnic jerk]], which is not a disorder.
* [[Rapid eye movement behavior disorder]] (RBD): Acting out violent or dramatic dreams while in REM sleep, sometimes injuring bed partner or self (REM sleep disorder or RSD)
* [[Restless legs syndrome]] (RLS): An irresistible urge to move legs. RLS sufferers often also have PLMD.
* Situational [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]]s: [[shift work sleep disorder]] (SWSD) and [[jet lag]].
* [[Sleep apnea]], [[obstructive sleep apnea]]: Obstruction of the airway during sleep, causing lack of sufficient deep sleep, often accompanied by snoring. Other forms of sleep apnea are less common. When air is blocked from entering into the lungs, the individual unconsciously gasps for air and sleep is disturbed. Stops of breathing of at least ten seconds, 30 times within seven hours of sleep, classifies as apnea.<ref>http://www.healthscout.com/ency/1/457/main.html</ref>
* [[Sleep paralysis]]: is characterized by temporary [[paralysis]] of the body shortly before or after sleep. Sleep paralysis may be accompanied by [[visual]], [[sound|auditory]] or [[tactile]] [[hallucinations]]. Not a disorder unless severe. Often seen as part of narcolepsy.
* [[Sleepwalking]] or ''somnambulism'': Engaging in activities that are normally associated with wakefulness (such as [[eating]] or [[clothing|dressing]]), which may include walking, without the conscious knowledge of the subject.
* [[Nocturia]]: A frequent need to get up and go to the bathroom to urinate at night. It differs from [[Enuresis]], or bed-wetting, in which the person does not arouse from sleep, but the bladder nevertheless empties.<ref>[http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/sleep-related-problems/nocturia-and-sleep www.sleepfoundation.org]</ref>
* [[Somniphobia]]: A cause of sleep deprivation. [[Somniphobia]] is a dread/ fear of falling asleep or going to bed. Signs of illness include anxiety and panic attacks during attempts to sleep and before it. <ref>[http://your-health-center.com/issweetsleep  O'Conan, Zaak. Print]</ref>
* [[Kleine-Levin syndrome]]

==Types==
* [[Dyssomnia]]s - A broad category of sleep disorders characterized by either [[hypersomnia]] or insomnia. The three major subcategories include intrinsic (i.e., arising from within the body), extrinsic (secondary to environmental conditions or various pathologic conditions), and disturbances of circadian rhythm. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=mesh&list_uids=68020920&dopt=Full MeSH ]
** [[Insomnia]]: Insomnia is often a symptom of a mood disorder (i.e., emotional stress, anxiety, depression) or underlying health condition (i.e., asthma, diabetes, heart disease, pregnancy or neurological conditions).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Melinda Smith, M.A., Lawrence Robinson, Robert Segal, M.A. |title=Sleep Disorders and Sleeping Problems |date=September 2011 |url=http://helpguide.org/life/sleep_disorders.htm}}</ref>
** Primary [[hypersomnia]].  Hypersomnia of central or brain origin.
***[[Narcolepsy]]: A chronic neurological disorder (or dyssomnia), which is caused by the brain's inability to control sleep and wakefulness.<ref>{{cite journal |author= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |title=NINDS Narcolepsy |date=June 27, 2011 |url= http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/narcolepsy/narcolepsy.htm}}</ref>
***[[Idiopathic hypersomnia]]: a chronic neurological disease similar to narcolepsy in which there is an increased amount of fatigue and sleep during the day. Patients who suffer from idiopathic hypersomnia cannot obtain a healthy amount of sleep for a regular day of activities. This hinders the patients' ability to perform well, and the patient has to deal with this for the rest of their lives.<ref>http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Sleep+disorders&rft.jtitle=Handbook+of+clinical+neurology+%2F+edited+by+P.J.+Vinken+and+G.W.+Bruyn&rft.au=Voderholzer%2C+Ulrich&rft.au=Guilleminault%2C+Christian&rft.date=2012-01-01&rft.issn=0072-9752&rft.volume=106&rft.spage=527&rft_id=info:pmid/22608642&rft.externalDocID=22608642</ref>

==Tests used to diagnose insomnia==
The following tests are used to diagnose insomnia.{{cn|date=August 2012}}
*[[Sleep diary]]: Tracking sleep patterns may help a doctor reach a diagnosis.
*[[Epworth Sleepiness Scale]]: a validated questionnaire that is used to assess daytime sleepiness
*[[Polysomnogram]]: a test measuring brain and muscle activity including breathing during sleep
*[[Multiple Sleep Latency Test]]: a test for daytime sleepiness, usually administered the day after overnight polysomnography
*[[Actigraphy]]: a test to assess sleep-wake patterns, usually for a week or more. Actigraphs are wrist-worn devices, about the size of a wristwatch, that measure movement.
*Mental health exam: Because insomnia may be a symptom of depression, anxiety, or another mental health disorder, a mental status exam, mental health history, and basic mental evaluations may be part of the assessment for a person complaining of insomnia.

==General principles of treatment==
[[File:Pediatric polysomnogram.jpg|thumb|left|Pediatric [[polysomnography]]]]

Treatments for sleep disorders generally can be grouped into four categories:

* [[Psychotherapy|Behavioral and psychotherapeutic]] treatment

* Rehabilitation and management

* Medication

* Other [[Somatic|somatic treatment]]

None of these general approaches is sufficient for all patients with sleep disorders. Rather, the choice of a specific treatment depends on the patient's diagnosis, medical and psychiatric history, and preferences, as well as the expertise of the treating clinician. Often, behavioral/psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches are not incompatible and can effectively be combined to maximize therapeutic benefits. Management of sleep disturbances that are secondary to mental, medical, or substance abuse disorders should focus on the underlying conditions.

Medications and somatic treatments may provide the most rapid symptomatic relief from some sleep disturbances. Certain disorders like narcolepsy, are best treated with prescription drugs such as Modafinil. <ref>http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Sleep+disorders&rft.jtitle=Handbook+of+clinical+neurology+%2F+edited+by+P.J.+Vinken+and+G.W.+Bruyn&rft.au=Voderholzer%2C+Ulrich&rft.au=Guilleminault%2C+Christian&rft.date=2012-01-01&rft.issn=0072-9752&rft.volume=106&rft.spage=527&rft_id=info:pmid/22608642&rft.externalDocID=22608642</ref> Others, such as chronic and primary insomnia, may be more amenable to behavioral interventions, with more durable results.

Chronic sleep disorders in childhood, which affect some 70% of children with developmental or psychological disorders, are under-reported and under-treated. Sleep-phase disruption is also common among adolescents, whose school schedules are often incompatible with their natural circadian rhythm. Effective treatment begins with careful diagnosis using sleep diaries and perhaps sleep studies. Modifications in sleep hygiene may resolve the problem, but medical treatment is often warranted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ivanenko A and Massey C|title=Assessment and Management of Sleep Disorders in Children  |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=23 |issue=11|date=October 1, 2006 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/sleep-disorders/article/10168/52051}}</ref>

Special equipment may be required for treatment of several disorders such as obstructive apnea, the circadian rhythm disorders and bruxism. In these cases, when severe, an acceptance of living with the disorder, however well managed, is often necessary.

Some sleep disorders have been found to compromise glucose metabolism.<ref name=Keckeis>{{Cite journal | author=Keckeis M, Lattova Z, Maurovich-Horvat E, Beitinger PA, Birkmann S, Lauer CJ, Wetter TC, Wilde-Frenz J, Pollmächer T. | title= Impaired Glucose Tolerance in Sleep Disorders | journal=PloS 1 | year=2010 | pages= 9444 | volume=3 | issue=5 | pmid=20209158

==Sleep medicine==
{{main|Sleep medicine}}
[[File:Normison.jpg|thumb|300px|Normison ([[temazepam]]) is a [[benzodiazepine]] commonly prescribed for [[insomnia]] and other sleep disorders.<ref>[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Temazepam Dictionary | Definition of Temazepam]</ref>]]

Due to rapidly increasing knowledge about sleep in the 20th century, including the discovery of REM sleep and sleep apnea, the medical importance of sleep was recognized. The medical community began paying more attention than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the USA, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and sleep disorders had been founded, and a need for standards arose.

Sleep Medicine is now a recognized subspecialty within [[internal medicine]], [[family medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[otolaryngology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] in the United States. Certification in Sleep Medicine shows that the specialist:<blockquote>"has demonstrated expertise in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions that occur during sleep, that disturb sleep, or that are affected by disturbances in the wake-sleep cycle. This specialist is skilled in the analysis and interpretation of comprehensive polysomnography, and well-versed in emerging research and management of a sleep laboratory."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.abms.org/Who_We_Help/Physicians/specialties.aspx |title= American Board of Medical Specialties : Recognized Physician Specialty and Subspecialty Certificates |accessdate= 2008-07-21 |author= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= }}</ref> </blockquote>

Competence in sleep medicine requires an understanding of a myriad of very diverse disorders, many of which present with similar [[symptom]]s such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which, in the absence of volitional [[sleep deprivation]], "is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder", such as sleep apnea, [[narcolepsy]], [[idiopathic hypersomnia]], [[Kleine-Levin syndrome]], menstrual-related hypersomnia, [[idiopathic]] recurrent stupor, or [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders|circadian rhythm disturbances]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mahowald | first = M.W. | year = 2000 | month = March | title = What is causing excessive daytime sleepiness?: evaluation to distinguish sleep deprivation from sleep disorders | journal = Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 108–23 | publisher = | doi = 10.3810/pgm.2000.03.932| bibcode = | url = http://www.postgradmed.com/issues/2000/03_00/mahowald.shtml | accessdate = 2008-07-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080530012343/http://www.postgradmed.com/issues/2000/03_00/mahowald.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-30 | pmid=10728139}}</ref> Another common complaint is insomnia, a set of symptoms which can have a great many different causes, physical and mental. Management in the varying situations differs greatly and cannot be undertaken without a correct diagnosis.

Sleep dentistry ([[bruxism]], snoring and sleep apnea), while not recognized as one of the nine [[dentistry|dental specialties]], qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The resulting Diplomate status is recognized by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA).<ref>{{cite web

In the UK, knowledge of sleep medicine and possibilities for diagnosis and treatment seem to lag.  Guardian.co.uk quotes the director of the [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust|Imperial College Healthcare]] Sleep Centre: "One problem is that there has been relatively little training in sleep medicine in this country – certainly there is no structured training for sleep physicians."<ref>{{cite news
