The '''triple test''', also called  '''triple screen''', the Kettering test or the Bart's test, is an investigation performed during [[pregnancy]] in the second trimester to classify a patient as either high-risk or low-risk for chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects).

The term "multiple-marker screening test" is sometimes used instead.<ref name="pmid9572446">{{cite journal |author=Renier MA, Vereecken A, Van Herck E, Straetmans D, Ramaekers P, Buytaert P |title=Second trimester maternal dimeric inhibin-A in the multiple-marker screening test for Down's syndrome |journal=Hum.

The Triple test measures [[Blood serum|serum]] levels of [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]], [[estriol]], and [[beta-hCG]], with a 70% [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] and 5% [[false-positive]] rate.  It is complemented in some regions of the United States, as the ''Quad test'' (adding inhibin A to the panel, resulting in an 81% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for detecting [[Down syndrome]] when taken at 15–18 weeks of [[gestational age]])<ref>{{cite doi|10.1258/jms.2009.009017}}</ref> and other [[prenatal diagnosis]] techniques, although it remains widely used in Canada<ref>[http://www.sogc.org/health/pregnancy-prenatal_e.asp sogc.org]</ref> and other countries. A positive test means having a high risk of chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects), and such patients are then referred for more sensitive and specific procedures to receive a definitive diagnosis, mostly invasive procedures like [[amniocentesis]]. The Triple test can be understood as an early predecessor to a long line of subsequent technological improvements.  In some American states, such as Missouri, Medicaid reimburses only for the Triple test and not other potentially more accurate screening tests, whereas California offers Quad tests to all pregnant women.<ref>[http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/pns/Documents/Provider%20Handbook%20%202009%20WEB.pdf cdph.ca.gov]</ref>

==Conditions screened==
The most common abnormality the test can screen is [[trisomy 21]] ([[Down syndrome]]). In addition to Down syndrome, the triple and quadruple tests screen for fetal [[trisomy 18]] also known as [[Edward's syndrome]], open [[neural tube defects]], and may also detect an increased risk of [[Turner syndrome]], [[triploidy]], [[trisomy 16]] mosaicism, [[fetal death]], [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]], and [[steroid sulfatase deficiency]].<ref name="pmid12135803">{{cite journal |author=Benn PA |title=Advances in prenatal screening for Down syndrome: I. general principles and second trimester testing |journal=Clin.

==Values measured==
The triple test measures the following three levels in the maternal serum:<ref name="pmid17601890">{{cite journal |author=Ball RH, Caughey AB, Malone FD, ''et al.'' |title=First- and second-trimester evaluation of risk for Down syndrome |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=10–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17601890 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000263470.89007.e3}}</ref>

* [[alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP)
* [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG)
* unconjugated [[estriol]] (UE<sub>3</sub>)

==Interpretation==
The levels may indicate increased risk for certain conditions:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''[[alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]]''' || '''UE<sub>3</sub>''' || '''[[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]]''' || '''Associated conditions''' 
 |- 
 | low || low || high || [[Down Syndrome]]
 |- 
 | low || low || low  || [[trisomy 18]] ([[Edward's syndrome]])
 |- 
 | high || n/a || n/a  || [[neural tube defects]] like [[spina bifida]] associated with increase levels of [[acetylcholinesterase]] in aminonic fluid, or [[omphalocele]], or [[gastroschisis]], or [[multiple gestation]] like [[twins]] or [[Multiple birth|triplets]]
|}

An estimated risk is calculated and adjusted for the expectant mother's [[Ageing|age]];<ref name="titleDowns Syndrome Screening at Nottingham City Hospital">{{cite web |url=http://www.nuh.nhs.uk/nch/clinpath/resources/downs/default.htm |title=Downs Syndrome Screening at Nottingham City Hospital |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}</ref> if she's diabetic; if she's having twins or other multiples, and the gestational age of the fetus. Weight and ethnicity may also be used in adjustments.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Many of these factors affect the levels of the substances being measured and the interpretation of the results. 

The test is for [[Screening (medicine)|screening]], not for [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]],<ref name="pmid18041410">{{cite journal |author=Lamlertkittikul S, Chandeying V |title=Experience on triple markers serum screening for Down syndrome fetus in Hat Yai, Regional Hospital |journal=J Med Assoc Thai |volume=90 |issue=10 |pages=1970–6 |year=2007 |pmid=18041410 |doi=}}</ref> and does not have nearly the same predictive power of [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]]. The screening test carries a much lower risk to the [[fetus]], however, and in conjunction with the age-related risk of the patient it is useful to help determine the need for more invasive tests.

==Variations==

If only two of the hormones above are tested for, then the test is  called a double test. A quad test tests an additional hormone, [[inhibin]]. Furthermore, the triple test may be combined with an [[ultrasound]] measurement of [[nuchal translucency]]. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}

===[[Double test]]===
Only AFP and hCG are measured. However, the maternal age, weight, ethnicity etc. are still included. In the UK, a double test is considered obsolete.<ref>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=-1422589918&linkID=34120&cook=yes double test] in GPnotebook. Retrieved April 2012</ref>

===Quadruple test===
A test of levels of dimeric [[inhibin]] A (DIA) is sometimes added to the other three tests, under the name "quadruple test."<ref name="pmid16700087">{{cite journal |author=Wald NJ, Morris JK, Ibison J, Wu T, George LM |title=Screening in early pregnancy for pre-eclampsia using Down syndrome quadruple test markers |journal=Prenat. Diagn. |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=559–64 |year=2006 |pmid=16700087 |doi=10.1002/pd.1459}}</ref> Other names used include "quad test", "quad screen", or "tetra screen."  [[Inhibin]] A (DIA) will be found high in cases of Trisomy 21 and low in cases of Trisomy 18.
