The '''University of Central Florida College of Medicine''' is an academic [[college]] of the [[University of Central Florida]] located in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]], [[USA]]. The [[dean (education)|dean]] of the college is Deborah C. German, M.D.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.med.ucf.edu/about/welcome/index.asp |title=UCF College of Medicine :: About the College :: Dean's Welcome |accessdate=2009-06-01 |publisher=UCF College of Medicine}}</ref>

The college consists of a public medical school located on the UCF Health Sciences Campus in southeast Orlando within a 650-acre health and life sciences park known as [[Lake Nona Medical City]].

==History==
On March 23, 2006, the [[Florida Board of Governors]] voted 15-1 in support of UCF's proposal to build a medical college. The medical college will constitute a new UCF medical campus that is being constructed at [[Lake Nona]], located on the eastern edge of Orlando near the [[Orlando International Airport]].  Upon completion of the first phase, the base of this medical college will include a {{convert|113000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} building for the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, a {{convert|130000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} medical college instructional building and a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} library.

In October 2005, a local Orlando investment company, the [[Tavistock Group]], donated $12.5 million and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land to UCF to help establish the UCF Medical School at Lake Nona, and issued a challenge to the Orlando community to help the university raise an additional $12.5 million to boost the total amount of raised funds to $25 million.  This $25 million would be eligible for a matching state grant, thus giving UCF the needed $50 million to create the medical college. UCF received well over $100 million in donations, state-matching funds, and land value for the medical college's establishment.

The new College of Medicine offered an unprecedented full scholarship package to every member of its charter class, 41 students entering in Fall 2009.<ref name="ucfnewsroom1">{{cite news | title = UCF's First Med Students Greeted with Ceremony, Surprise | date = 2009-08-03 | url = http://newsarchive.smca.ucf.edu/index_page_article_id_00240041037381429012136c33d79002dda.html | publisher = UCF Newsroom | accessdate = 2011-02-15 }}</ref> The scholarship, financed by various donors, amounts to $40,000 per year, half going to tuition (out-of-state fees being waived) and the other half for living expenses. Dean German spearheaded the effort to secure these scholarships, having herself received a similar scholarship at [[Harvard Medical School]].<ref name="stat">{{cite news | title = 2,700 apply for Florida medical school's tuition-free offer | date = 2008-09-08 | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/09/15/prsb0915.htm | publisher = American Medical News | accessdate = 2011-02-15 }}</ref> The new school received over 4,300 applications, including at least one with a perfect [[MCAT]] score, making it at that time the most selective medical school in the United States.<ref name="ucfnewsroom1"/><ref name="stat"/>

Matriculates had an average GPA of 3.76, median MCAT score of 32, and were 25 years old. 19% of those admitted had previously earned a [[Postbaccalaureate_program|post-bachelorette]] degree.<ref name="admissions"/>

===Curriculum===
The medical school's curriculum began clinical education in Fall 2009, and the college is expected to produce about 120 medical graduates a year, starting with 41 students in the first class and increasing in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite news | title = State Board of Governors Approves Med School | publisher = University of Central Florida | date = 2007-06-21 | url = http://news.ucf.edu/UCFnews/index?page=article&id=002400410774959e30109f4453599007871 | accessdate = 2007-10-28 }}</ref> Full accreditation has been granted to the medical school, and the college is currently accepting applications for the fifth class of 100 students for Fall 2013 enrollment.<ref>{{cite news | title = College of Medicine Welcomes Its Newest Class | url = http://news.ucf.edu/UCFnews/index?page=article&id=002400416a60cde7013003bb6e2405be | accessdate = 2011-08-01}}</ref> 

The medical school curriculum is four years long. The first two years are composed mainly of classroom basic sciences education, while the last two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Clinical education is spread across all four years, with the final years being more heavily weighted towards clinical rotations. The four-year medical program capitalizes on UCF's existing strengths in biomedical sciences, modeling and simulation, and optics and photonics. Other programs in materials science, psychology, chemistry, film and digital media, and nursing will support the program.

==Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences==
The Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences houses the Department of [[Molecular Biology]] and [[Microbiology]], the Biomolecular Science Center, the Medical Laboratory Sciences Program and the Pre-Health Professions Advisement Office. The school offers three undergraduate degrees: a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, a Bachelor of Science in [[Biotechnology]], and a Bachelor of Science in [[Medical laboratory|Medical Laboratory Science]]. Two graduate degrees are also offered: a [[Master of Science]] in Molecular Biology and Microbiology and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Science. In addition to these, the school also offers an accelerated Bachelors to Medicine program, in conjunction with the [[University of South Florida]]. Students complete three years at UCF, before matriculating into the University of South Florida College of Medicine. At the end of the program they are awarded a bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and a [[Doctor of Medicine|Medical Doctorate]].

The school was named after Al and Nancy Burnett after receiving a $10 million donation from them. The current director of the school is Dr. Pappachan E. Kolattukudy.<ref>{{cite web | title = Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences - Faculty & Staff - Dr. Pappachan E.
