'''Infant massage''' is a type of [[complementary and alternative medicine|complementary and alternative treatment]] that uses [[massage]] therapy for human [[infant]]s. This therapy has been practiced globally, and has been increasingly used in Western countries as a treatment for infants, though the scientific evidence supporting its use is limited. Research in [[preterm birth|pre-term infants]] and [[low birth weight]] infants have found weak evidence that massage might improve weight gain, but these results are based on possibly biased studies and therefore no recommendation can be made for universal use at this time.  Research into the effectiveness of massage therapy on full term infants has found some tentative evidence for some benefits such as sleeping and crying in infants, though the evidence is not strong enough to recommend universally, and more research is needed.

==History==
[[Ayurvedic medicine]] in [[History of India|ancient India]] taught the use of infant massage.<ref>Johari H. (1996). Ayurvedic Massage: Traditional Indian Techniques for Balancing Body and Mind.

==Research==

===Full term infants===

A [[Cochrane review]] of studies on the benefits of massage therapy for infants less than 6 months of age (and were not pre-term or underweight) found tentative evidence of benefit for mother-infant interaction, sleeping and crying, and on [[stress hormone]] levels. The evidence for these benefits, however, came from a relatively small number of studies, and no [[meta-analysis]] could be performed on these outcomes.  Other evidence of physical health benefits such as weight gain were only found in studies that were at high risk of [[bias]].  The study found no evidence to suggest massage affects [[mental health]] outcomes such as infant attachment, temperament or [[mental development]].  This level of evidence may be enough to support community use of massage therapy, but more research is needed before it can be universally recommended.<ref name=Underdown>{{cite journal |author=Underdown A, Barlow J, Chung V, Stewart-Brown S |title=Massage intervention for promoting mental and physical health in infants aged under six months |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD005038 |year=2006 |pmid=17054233 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005038.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Underdown |editor1-first=Angela}}</ref>

===Preterm infants===

A Cochrane review of studies looking at massage therapy for pre-term and low birth weight found that the evidence for benefits was weak. While a meta-analysis of studies found that massage was associated with increased weight gain and decreased [[length of stay]] in the hospital, the reviewers had "serious concerns" about the methodological quality of the studies, specifically raising the concern of [[publication bias]]. These concerns weakened the credibility of the studies, and led the reviewers to conclude there was not enough evidence to recommend widespread use of massage for pre-term or low birth weight infants. The review also suggested those neonatal intensive care units that have nurses provide massage therapy to reconsider whether it is cost-effective use of their time to do so.<ref name = Vickers>{{cite journal |author=Vickers A, Ohlsson A, Lacy JB, Horsley A |title=Massage for promoting growth and development of preterm and/or low birth-weight infants |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000390 |year=2004 |pmid=15106151 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000390.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Vickers |editor1-first=Andrew}}</ref>

==Proposed mechanisms==

Various mechanisms have been proposed as to suggest how massage therapy might benefit infants.  For pre-term infants, it has been suggested that any weight gain may be due to improved metabolic efficiency or by reducing the adverse reaction of stress through decreasing stress behavior or stress hormones.<ref name=Vickers/>  Other possible mechanisms include increased [[vagal]] activity and secretion of [[insulin]] and [[gastrin]] as well as improved parent-infant relationships.<ref name = Underdown/>

==Safety==

Reviews of the literature have found no significant risks for adverse events with massage theory with either full term or pre-term infants.<ref name=Underdown/><ref name=Vickers/>  One study found that the use of certain oils in traditional societies such as [[mustard oil]] or [[olive oil]] might adversely affect pre-term newborn [[human skin|skin]] barrier function, while integrity and permeability while other oils that are [[linoleate]]-enriched such as [[sunflower seed oil]] may improve them.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/080352502753711678 | last1 = Darmstadt | first1 = GL | last2 = Mao-Qiang | first2 = M | last3 = Chi | first3 = E | last4 = Saha | first4 = SK | last5 = Ziboh | first5 = VA | last6 = Black | first6 = RE | last7 = Santosham | first7 = M | last8 = Elias | first8 = PM. | year = 2002 | title = Impact of topical oils on the skin barrier: possible implications for neonatal health in developing countries | url = | journal = Acta Paediatr | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 546–54 | pmid = 12113324 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mullany | first1 = LC | last2 = Darmstadt | first2 = GL | last3 = Khatry | first3 = SK | last4 = Tielsch | first4 = JM | title = Traditional Massage of Newborns in Nepal: Implications for Trials of Improved Practice | journal = Journal of tropical pediatrics | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 82–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15677372 | pmc = 1317296 | doi = 10.1093/tropej/fmh083 }}</ref>
