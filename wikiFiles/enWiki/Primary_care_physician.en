A '''primary care physician''', or '''PCP''', is a [[physician]] who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis. This term is primarily used in the [[United States]], although this is a recent occurrence. In years' past in the US and in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (and many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is “[[general practitioner]]”. 

All physicians first complete [[medical school]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MBBS]], or [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|DO]]). To become primary care physicians, medical school graduates then undertake postgraduate training in primary care programs, such as [[family medicine]] (also called [[family practice]] or [[general practice]] in some countries), [[pediatrics]] or [[internal medicine]].   Some [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]]s consider [[gynecologist]]s as PCPs for the care of women, and have allowed certain subspecialists to assume PCP responsibilities for selected patient types, such as [[allergist]]s caring for people with [[asthma]] and [[nephrologist]]s acting as PCPs for patients on [[kidney]] [[dialysis]].

[[Emergency physician]]s are sometimes counted as primary care physicians. Emergency physicians see many primary care cases, but in contrast to family physicians, pediatricians and internists, are trained and organized to focus on episodic care, acute intervention, stabilization, and discharge or transfer or referral to definitive care, with less of a focus on chronic conditions and limited provision for continuing care.

==Scope of practice==
A set of skills and scope of practice may define a primary care physician, generally including basic diagnosis and treatment of common illnesses and medical conditions.<ref>{{cite book | last = Institute of Medicine | title = Primary Care: America's Health in a New Era | publisher = National Academies Press | year = 1996 | page =  27 | url = http://newton.nap.edu/books/0309053994/html/27.html | accessdate = 2006-08-30}}</ref> Diagnostic techniques include interviewing the patient to collect information on the present [[symptoms]], prior [[medical history]] and other health details, followed by a [[physical examination]]. Many PCPs are trained in basic [[medical test]]ing, such as interpreting results of blood or other patient samples, [[electrocardiogram]]s, or [[x-ray]]s. More complex and time-intensive diagnostic procedures are usually obtained by referral to [[Medical specialist|specialist]]s, due to either special training with a technology, or increased experience and patient volume that renders a risky procedure safer for the patient.<ref>{{cite book | last = Institute of Medicine | title = Interpreting the Volume-Outcome Relationship in the Context of Health Care Quality | publisher = National Academies Press | year = 2000 | url = http://darwin.nap.edu/books/NI000322/html | accessdate = 2006-08-30}}</ref> After collecting data, the PCP arrives at a [[differential diagnosis]] and, with the participation of the patient, formulates a plan including (if appropriate) components of further testing, specialist referral, medication, therapy, diet or life-style changes, patient education, and follow up results of treatment. Primary care physicians also counsel and educate patients on safe [[Behavior change|health behaviors]], self-care skills and treatment options, and provide [[Screening (medicine)|screening tests]] and [[immunizations]].

===Role in the health care system===
A primary care physician is usually the first medical practitioner contacted by a patient, due to factors such as ease of communication, accessible location, familiarity, and increasingly issues of cost and [[managed care]] requirements. In some countries, for example [[Norway]], residents are registered as patients of a (local) doctor, and must contact that doctor for referral to any other.  Also many [[health maintenance organizations]] position PCPs as "gatekeepers", who regulate access to more costly procedures or specialists. Ideally, the primary care physician acts on behalf of the patient to collaborate with referral specialists, coordinate the care given by varied organizations such as hospitals or rehabilitation clinics, act as a comprehensive repository for the patient's records, and provide long-term management of chronic conditions. Continuous care is particularly important for patients with medical conditions that encompass multiple organ systems and require prolonged treatment and monitoring, such as [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]].

==Studies of the quality of care provided by primary care physicians==
Studies that compare the knowledge base and quality of care provided by generalists versus specialists usually find that the specialists are more knowledgeable and provide better care.<ref name="pmid11422631">{{cite journal | author = Majumdar S, Inui T, Gurwitz J, Gillman M, McLaughlin T, Soumerai S | title = Influence of physician specialty on adoption and relinquishment of calcium channel blockers and other treatments for myocardial infarction | journal = J Gen Intern Med | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 351–9 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11422631 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016006351.x | pmc = 1495223}}</ref><ref name="pmid8759658">{{cite journal | author = Fendrick A, Hirth R, Chernew M | title = Differences between generalist and specialist physicians regarding Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease | journal = Am J Gastroenterol | volume = 91 | issue = 8 | pages = 1544–8 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8759658}}</ref> However, these studies examine the quality of care in the domain of the specialists.

Studies of the quality of preventive health care find the opposite results – primary care physicians perform best.  An analysis of elderly patients found that patients seeing generalists, as compared to patients seeing specialists, were more likely to receive influenza vaccination.<ref name="pmid9582044">{{cite journal | author = Rosenblatt R, Hart L, Baldwin L, Chan L, Schneeweiss R | title = The generalist role of specialty physicians: is there a hidden system of primary care? | journal = JAMA | volume = 279 | issue = 17 | pages = 1364–70 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9582044 | doi = 10.1001/jama.279.17.1364}}</ref> In health promotion counseling, a studies of self-reported behavior found that generalists were more likely than internal medicine specialists to counsel patients<ref name="pmid1983933">{{cite journal | author = Lewis C, Clancy C, Leake B, Schwartz J | title = The counseling practices of internists | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–8 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1983933}}</ref> and to screen for breast cancer.<ref name="pmid1599724">{{cite journal | author = Turner B, Amsel Z, Lustbader E, Schwartz J, Balshem A, Grisso J | title = Breast cancer screening: effect of physician specialty, practice setting, year of medical school graduation, and sex | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 78–85 | year = 1992| pmid = 1599724}}</ref>

Exceptions may be diseases that are so common that primary care physicians develop their own expertise. A study of patients with acute low back pain found the primary care physicians provided equivalent quality of care, but at lower costs than orthopedic specialists.<ref name="pmid7666878">{{cite journal | author = Carey T, Garrett J, Jackman A, McLaughlin C, Fryer J, Smucker D | title = The outcomes and costs of care for acute low back pain among patients seen by primary care practitioners, chiropractors, and orthopedic surgeons.

Factors associated with quality of care by primary care doctors:
* The more experience the primary care physician has with a specific disease.<ref name="pmid8594430">{{cite journal | author = Kitahata M, Koepsell T, Deyo R, Maxwell C, Dodge W, Wagner E | title = Physicians' experience with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as a factor in patients' survival | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 334 | issue = 11 | pages = 701–6 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8594430 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199603143341106}}</ref>
* Physician group affiliation with networks of multiple groups.<ref name="pmidpending">Friedberg et al., “Does Affiliation of Physician Groups with One Another Produce Higher Quality Primary Care?,” Journal of General Internal Medicine 22, no. 10 (October 21, 2007): 1385-1392, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-007-0234-0 (accessed September 28, 2007).</ref>

==Challenges for primary care==
===Declining numbers===
Shortages of primary care physicians are an increasing problem in many developed countries{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

Causes parallel the evolutionary changes occurring in the US medical system: payment based on quantity of services delivered, not quality; aging of the population increases the prevalence and complexity of chronic health conditions, most of which are handled in primary care settings; and increasing emphasis on life-style changes and preventative measures, often poorly covered by health insurance or not at all.<ref name=survive>{{cite journal | last = Bodenheimer | first = Thomas | title = Primary care - Will It Survive? | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 355  | issue = 9 | pages = 861–864 | date = 2006-08-31 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/9/861 | accessdate = 2006-08-31 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp068155 | pmid = 16943396 }}</ref> In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and the gap is widening.<ref>Medical Group Management Association Physician Compensation Survey, 1998 - 2005: [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/9/864/F1 Median Compensation for Selected Medical Specialties] Retrieved 30 August 2006</ref> Discontent by practicing primary care internists is discouraging trainees from entering primary care; in a 2007 survey of 1,177 graduating US medical students, only 2% planned to enter a general internal medicine career, and lifestyle was emphasized over the higher subspecialty pay in their decision.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Karen E.

===Maldistribution===
Developing countries face an even more critical disparity in primary care practitioners. The Pan American Health Organization reported in 2005 that "...the Americas region has made important progress in health, but significant challenges and disparities remain. Among the most important is the need to extend quality health care to all sectors of the population...Experience over the last 27 years shows that health systems that adhere to the principles of primary health care produce greater efficiency and better health outcomes in terms of both individual and public health..." <ref>Pan American Health Organization (September 2005): [http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/ptoday12_nov05.htm Regional Declaration on the New Orientations of Primary Health Care] Retrieved 30 August 2006</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has identified worsening trends in access to PCPs and other primary care workers, both in the developed and the developing nations:<ref>World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/whr/2006/overview/en/ World Health Report-2006] Retrieved 30 August 2006</ref>
*"Worker numbers and quality are positively associated with immunization coverage, outreach of primary care, and infant, child and maternal survival"
*"The quality of doctors and the density of their distribution have been shown to correlate with positive outcomes in cardiovascular diseases"
*"In health systems, (primary care) workers function as gatekeepers and navigators for the effective, or wasteful, application of all other resources such as drugs, vaccines and supplies"
*"there are currently 57 countries with critical shortages equivalent to a global deficit of 2.4 million doctors, nurses and midwives"
*"In many countries, the skills of limited yet expensive professionals are not well matched to the local profile of health needs"
*"...all countries suffer from maldistribution characterized by urban concentration and rural deficits"
*"Richer countries face a future of low fertility and large populations of elderly people, which will cause a shift towards chronic and degenerative diseases with high care demands"
*"Growing gaps will exert even greater pressure on the outflow of health workers from poorer regions"

===Lagging quality of care measures===
A survey of 6,000 primary care doctors in seven countries revealed disparities in several areas that affect quality of care.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cathy Schoen, Robin Osborn, Phuong Trang Huynh, Michelle Doty, Jordon Peugh, and Kinga Zapert | title = On The Front Lines Of Care: Primary Care Doctors' Office Systems, Experiences, And Views In Seven Countries | journal = Health Affairs | date = 1999-11-02 | url = http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/hlthaff.25.w555?ijkey=3YyH7yDwrJSoc&keytype=ref&siteid=healthaff| accessdate = 2006-11-06 | pmid = 17102164 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.25.w555 | format = abstract | volume = 25 | pages = w555 | first1 = C | last2 = Osborn | first2 = R | last3 = Huynh | first3 = PT | last4 = Doty | first4 = M | last5 = Peugh | first5 = J | last6 = Zapert | first6 = K | issue = 6}}</ref> Differences did not follow trends of the cost of care; primary care physicians in the United States lagged behind their counterparts in other countries, despite the fact that the US spends two to three times as much per capita. Arrangements for after-hours care were almost twice as common in the Netherlands, Germany and New Zealand as in Canada and the United States, where patients must rely on emergency facilities. Other major disparities include automated systems to remind patients about follow-up care, give patients test results or warn of harmful drug interactions. There were differences as well among primary care doctors, regarding financial incentives to improve the quality of care.
