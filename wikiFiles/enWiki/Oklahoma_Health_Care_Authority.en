==Duties==
The '''Oklahoma Health Care Authority''' has the primary duty of executing ''SoonerCare'', the Oklahoma version of [[Medicaid]]. SoonerCare is a health coverage program jointly funded by the [[United States federal government]] and the [[Government of Oklahoma|Oklahoma state government]]. The program provides payments to cover medical services to economically challenged individuals. OHCA determines financial eligibility for the program.

===SoonerCare===
''SoonerCare'' is medical care delivered by OHCA as prescribed by the [[Social Security Act of 1965]] (''the Medicaid Act''). The Federal Medicaid Act requires that certain medical services be delivered to recipients by hospitals and physicians. The State, however, is allowed to add other optional services, such as pharmacy services. With each of these programs, OHCA is responsible for setting compensation levels, services contained in each delivery system, contracts to deliver the services, and actuarial determinations regarding compensation. As of February 2012, those individuals covered by HCA comprise approximately 879,033 individuals across Oklahoma.<ref>[http://www.ok.gov/OSF/documents/bud13hd.pdf Oklahoma Fiscal Year 2013 Historical Documents], [[Oklahoma Office of State Finance]], 2012-02-06, pg 198</ref>

In order to be eligible to receive ''SoonerCare'' medical services from OHCA, an individual must meet any of the following requirements:
*Adults with children under 19
*Children under 19 and pregnant women
*Individuals 65 and older
*Individuals who are blind or who have disabilities
*Women under 65 in need of breast or cervical cancer treatment
*SoonerPlan - Men and women 19 and older with family planning needs

SoonerCare is a [[means test]]ed program. State law provides that SoonerCare may cover individuals who have an annual income of equal to or less than 185% of the United States [[federal poverty level]].<ref>[http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=440362 Section 1010.1, Title 56, Oklahoma Statutes - Oklahoma Medicaid Healthcare Options Act], [[Oklahoma Legislature]]</ref> OHCA contracts with [[Oklahoma Department of Human Services]] to determine eligibility for OHCA services. Additionally, OHCA actively works with the [[Office of the Oklahoma Attorney General]]'s ''Medicaid Fraud Unit'' to prosecute fraudulent providers.

===Insure Oklahoma===
'''Insure Oklahoma''' is an employer sponsored insurance plan administered by OHCA which provides employers with premium subsidies to help buy health insurance for low to moderate income employees. Insure Oklahoma also provides a way for individuals who participate in the Individual Plan to gain access to an affordable health care option.

In April 2004, Senate Bill 1546 authorized the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to develop a program assisting employees of small businesses, 19 to 64 years of age with either:
*a portion of their private health plan premiums (Employer Sponsored Insurance), or
*the purchase of a state sponsored health plan operated under the state Medicaid program (Individual Plan).

In November 2004, the Oklahoma Health Care Initiative created the funding mechanism to fund Insure Oklahoma. SQ 713, passed by a statewide vote, increased the [[sales tax]] on tobacco products. A portion of these revenues were designated to be used to fund the new health program.

==Organization==
The Authority is divided into four service branches: Soonercare Operations, Financial Services, Information Services, and Legal Services.

*'''Office of the Administrator''' - led by the Administrator of the Authority, immediate staff of the Administrator and provides policy direction for Authority and support to Board of Directors
**Administrative Services - led by Administrator's Chief of Staff
