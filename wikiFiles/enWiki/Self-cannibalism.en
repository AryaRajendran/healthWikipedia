{{For|the cellular phenomenon|Autophagy (cellular)}}
'''Self-cannibalism''' is the practice of eating oneself, also called '''autocannibalism''',<ref>[http://www.meish.org/012951.php#_ftnref4 "Man-eaters: The Evidence for Coastal Tupi Cannibalism" ''mei(sh) dot org'']</ref> or '''autosarcophagy'''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mikellides AP |title=Two cases of self-cannibalism (autosarcophagy) |journal=Cyprus Med J |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=498–500 |year=1950 |month=October |pmid=14849189 }}</ref> A similar term which is applied differently is ''[[autophagy (cellular)|autophagy]]'', which specifically denotes the normal process of self-degradation by [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. While almost an exclusive term for this process, autophagy nonetheless has occasionally made its way into more common usage.<ref>[http://www.benecke.com/bodmod2.html Benecke, Mark "First report of non-psychotic self-cannibalism (autophagy), tongue splicing and scar patterns (scarification) as an extreme form of cultural body modification in a Western civilization"]</ref>

==Self-cannibalism among humans==
===As a natural occurrence===
A certain amount of self-cannibalism occurs unwillingly, as the body consumes dead cells from the tongue and cheeks.
Ingesting one's own blood from an unintentional lesion such as a nose-bleed or an ulcer is clearly not intentional harvesting and consequently not considered cannibalistic.

[[Catabolisis]] is also sometimes described as "self-cannibalism." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===As a disorder or symptom thereof===
{{Main|Autophagia}}
[[Nail-biting|Fingernail-biting]] that develops into fingernail-eating is a form of [[pica (disorder)|pica]], although many{{who|date=December 2012}} do not consider nail biting as a true form of cannibalism.{{fact|date=December 2012}}  Other forms of pica include the [[Trichotillomania|compulsion of eating one's own hair]], which can form a [[Trichobezoar|hairball]] in the [[stomach]].{{fact|date=December 2012}}

===As a choice===
Some people will engage in self-cannibalism as an extreme form of [[body modification]], for example eating their own skin.<ref>See Benecke above.</ref> Others will drink their own blood, a practice called autovampirism,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=883741&dopt=Abstract NCBI PubMed]</ref> but [[Blood sucking#Human hematophagy|sucking blood]] from wounds is generally not seen to be cannibalism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Placentophagy]] may be a form of self-cannibalism. On January 13, 2007, Chilean artist [[Marco Evaristti]] hosted a dinner party for his most intimate friends. The main meal was [[agnolotti]] pasta, which was topped with a meatball made from the artist's own fat, removed in the previous year in a [[liposuction]] operation.<ref>''[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21052655-13762,00.html Artist Cooks meal in own Body Fat]'', January 13, 2007</ref>

==As a crime==
Forced self-cannibalism as a form of [[torture]] or [[war crime]] has been reported.  [[Erzsébet Báthory]] allegedly forced some of her servants to eat their own flesh in the early 17th century.<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/431/did-dracula-really-exist Adams, Cecil "Did Dracula really exist?" ''[[The Straight Dope]]'']</ref>  In the 16th century, Spanish colonizers forced [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] to eat their own testicles.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/delatorre/articles/macho.html [[Miguel A. De La Torre]], "Beyond Machismo: A Cuban Case Study" (citing Diana Iznaga, "Introduction" to Fernando Ortise, ''Los negros curros'' (La Habana: Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, 1986) xviii-xix.)]</ref>  Incidents were reported in the years following the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état]].<ref>[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43a/045.html Chin, Pat. "Behind the Rockwood case" ''Workers World'', April 6, 1996]</ref>  In the 1990s young people in [[Sudan]] were forced to eat their own ears.<ref>[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/Lambeth1998/Lambeth-Daily/06/humanrights.html ''Lambeth Daily News'' 6 August 1998]</ref>

==Self-cannibalism among animals==
The short-tailed [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] is known to eat its own wings.<ref>Taber, Stephen Welton (2005) ''Invertebrates Of Central Texas Wetlands'', page 200.</ref>   There is evidence of certain animals digesting their own nervous tissue when they transition to a new phase of life.  The [[sea squirt]] (with a tadpole-like shape) contains a ganglion 'brain' in its head, which it digests after attaching itself to a rock and becoming stationary, forming an [[sea anemone|anemone]]-like organism.  This has been used as evidence that the purpose of brain and nervous tissue is primarily to produce movement. Self-cannibalism behavior has been documented in [[North America]]n [[rat snake]]s: one captive individual twice attempted to consume itself, dying in the second attempt. Another wild rat snake individual was found having swallowed about two-thirds of its body.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mattison, Chris |title=The New Encyclopedia of Snakes |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=2007 |isbn=0-691-13295-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=105}}</ref>
