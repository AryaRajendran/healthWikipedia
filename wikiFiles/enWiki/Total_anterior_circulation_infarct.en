A '''Total Anterior Circulation Infarct''' ('''TACI''') is a type of [[cerebral infarction]] affecting the entire [[anterior]] [[Circulatory system|circulation]] supplying one side of the [[brain]].

'''Total Anterior Circulation Stroke Syndrome''' ('''TACS''') refers to the symptoms of a patient who clinically appears to have suffered from a total anterior circulation infarct, but who has not yet had any diagnostic imaging (e.g. [[CT Scan]]) to confirm the diagnosis.

It is diagnosed when it causes all 3 of the following symptoms:
* Higher dysfunction
** [[Dysphasia]]
** [[Visuospatial]] disturbances
** Decreased level of consciousness
* [[Homonymous hemianopia]]
* Motor and Sensory Defects (â‰¥2/3 of face, arm, leg)
