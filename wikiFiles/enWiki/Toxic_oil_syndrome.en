'''Toxic Oil Syndrome''' or simply '''Toxic Syndrome''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''síndrome del aceite tóxico'' or ''síndrome tóxico'') was the name given to a [[disease]] outbreak in [[Spain]] in 1981, which killed over 600 people.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100019316|Spanish toxic oil syndrome}}</ref>  Its first appearance was as a lung disease, with unusual features: though the [[symptom]]s initially resembled a [[lung]] [[infection]], [[antibiotic]]s were ineffective. The disease appeared to be restricted to certain geographical localities, and several members of a family could be affected, even while their neighbours had no symptoms. Following the acute phase, a range of other chronic symptoms was apparent.

== Overview ==

The cause was traced to the consumption of [[colza oil]] that had been intended for [[industry|industrial]] rather than [[food]] use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDE1F3CF931A3575BC0A961948260|title=A Long Trial in Spain on Fatal Tainted Food|date=August 2, 1987|work=[[New York Times]]|quote=The mysterious illness broke out in the spring of 1981, mostly in the Madrid area. The symptoms included respiratory problems, skin disorders and a weakening of the body's immune system. The oil had been bought from street vendors by many low-income families, restaurants and others. ...}}</ref> It had been imported as cheap industrial oil by the company RAPSA at [[San Sebastián]], handled by RAELCA and refined by ITH in [[Seville]]. It was sold as "[[olive oil]]" by street vendors at weekly street markets and was therefore used on salads and for cooking. The commonly-accepted hypothesis states that toxic compounds derived during the refinement process, used to remove the [[aniline]] and to denature oils intended for industrial use, were responsible.

Once the origin of the syndrome was realised, public health officials organized an exchange programme, whereby those who had bought the oil could exchange it for pure olive oil, thereby quickly ending the outbreak.

The conclusion that oil was the cause for TOS is based on strong [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence, since up to now, experimental studies performed in a variety of [[Animal testing|laboratory animal]]s have failed to reproduce the symptoms of human TOS. None of the in vivo or in vitro studies performed with toxic-oil-specific components, such as [[fatty acid]] [[Aniline#Acylation|anilide]]s and [[ester]]s of [[Purple acid phosphatases|PAP]], have provided evidence that these markers are causally involved in the pathogenesis of TOS.<ref>[http://www.euro.who.int/document/e84423.pdf Toxic Oil Syndrome - 10 Years of Progress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The fact that the first cases of the syndrome were located in Madrid, near the [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[military base]] in [[Torrejón de Ardoz]], and the secrecy surrounding the huge investigations, spread the idea of a [[conspiracy_theory|conspiracy]]. (Actually, the product had been exported from France and fraudulently passed as [[cooking oil]]). Also, several of those affected by the TOS claim they never consumed that oil.  Although the oil was mainly sold on street markets, a considerable percentage of the patients were upper class. Another theory suggests the toxic reaction was triggered by [[organophosphate]] [[Organophosphate poisoning|poisoning]] and covered up by the Spanish Government and the WHO.<ref name ="Guardian">http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/aug/25/research.highereducation</ref>
