'''Oropouche fever''' is a [[tropical diseases|tropical]] [[viral infection]], a [[zoonosis]] similar to [[dengue fever]], transmitted by biting [[midge]] (species ''[[Culicoides paraensis]]'') and [[mosquito]]es from the [[blood]] of [[sloth]]s to [[human]]s. It occurs mainly in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonic]] region, the [[Caribbean]] and [[Panama]]. The disease is named after the region where it was first described and isolated at the [[Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory]], in 1955, the [[Oropouche River]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and is caused by a specific [[arbovirus]], the [[Oropouche_Virus_(Bunyaviridae_Orthobunyavirus)|Oropouche virus]] (OROV), of the [[Bunyaviridae]] family.

==History==
OROV was first described in [[Brazil]] in 1960, isolated from the blood of a sloth (''Bradypus tridactylus'') captured in the [[rain forest]] during the construction of the [[Belém-Brasília Highway]]. The ''[[Ochlerotatus serratus]]'' [[mosquito]] was implicated as a possible [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], because OROV was found in their [[blood]] too.

According to Nunes et al. (2005), "the OROV [[genome]] consists of 3 partite, single-stranded, negative-sense [[RNA]]s, named large (L), medium (M), and small (S) RNA. These RNAs are predicted to encode a large [[protein]] (L: [[polymerase]] activity), viral surface [[glycoprotein]]s (Gc and Gn), and nonstructural [[NSM protein]], as well as both [[nucleocapsid]] (N) and [[NSS protein]]s. Complete [[nucleotide]] sequences have been determined for all 3 RNA segments, and previous studies of the [[molecular biology]] of the N gene (SRNA) of 28 different OROV [[Strain (biology)|strains]] indicated the existence of 3 [[genotype]]s, designated I, II, and III."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nunes MR, Martins LC, Rodrigues SG, ''et al'' |title=Oropouche virus isolation, southeast Brazil |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=1610–3 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16318707 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Large [[epidemy|epidemics]] are common and very swift, one of the earliest largest having occurred at the city of [[Belém]], in the Brazilian Amazon state of [[Pará]], with 11,000 recorded cases.  In the Brazilian Amazon, oropouche is the second most frequent viral disease, after dengue fever. Several epidemics have generated more than 263,000 cases, of which 130,000 alone occurred in the period from 1978 to 1980.<ref name="urlLe virus Oropouche">{{cite web |url=http://www.mpl.ird.fr/suds-en-ligne/fr/virales/emergenc/anthr09A.htm |title=Le virus Oropouche |work= |accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> Presently, in Brazil alone it is estimated that more than half a million cases have occurred.

==Presentation==
Oropouche fever has an abrupt onset fever, initially with generic [[symptoms]] similar to those seen in dengue fever. such as [[chill]]s, [[headache]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[muscle pain]] and [[joint pain]] and [[vomiting]]. Patients may develop symptoms of [[meningitis]]. Diagnosis is achieved by dosing the serum levels of the specific [[antibody]] to the virus.

==Treatment and prognosis==
The illness has no specific therapy, but usually [[symptomatic treatment]] is introduced, by using certain oral [[analgesic]] and anti-inflammatory agents, which should be prescribed by a physician, because some of them (such as [[aspirin]]) are dangerous because they reduce [[blood clotting]] activity and may aggravate the hemorrhagic effects;

The infection is usually self-limiting and complications are rare. Patients usually recover fully with no long term ill effects.
