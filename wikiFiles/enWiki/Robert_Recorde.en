'''Robert Recorde''' (ca. 1512&ndash;1558) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[physician]] and [[mathematician]]. He introduced the [[equals sign|"equals" sign (=)]] and also the [[plus and minus signs|"plus" sign(+)]] in 1557.

==Biography==
A member of a respectable family of [[Tenby]], [[Wales]], born in 1512,<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Johnston|title=Recorde, Robert (c.1512–1558)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23241|accessdate=2012-01-26|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/23241}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Recorde entered the [[University of Oxford]] about 1525, and was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] there in 1531. Having adopted medicine as a profession, he went to the [[University of Cambridge]] to take the degree of M.D. in 1545. He afterwards returned to Oxford, where he publicly taught mathematics, as he had done prior to going to Cambridge. It appears that he afterwards went to [[London]], and acted as physician to King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and to [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], to whom some of his books are dedicated. He was also controller of the [[Royal Mint]] and served as "Comptroller of Mines and Monies" in Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James R.|year=1956|title=The World Of Mathematics}}</ref> After being sued for defamation by a political enemy, he was arrested for debt and died in the [[King's Bench Prison]], [[Southwark]], by the middle of June in 1558.<ref name=ODNB/>

Recorde published several works upon mathematical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, such as the following:
*''[[The Ground of Arts|The Grounde of Artes]], teachings the Worke and Practise, of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions'' (1543),<ref name=ODNB/> the first English book on [[algebra]].
*''The Pathway to Knowledge, containing the First Principles of Geometry ... bothe for the use of Instrumentes Geometricall and Astronomicall, and also for Projection of Plattes'' (London, 1551)
*''The Castle of Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiall and Materiall, etc.'' (London, 1556) A book explaining [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic astronomy]] while mentioning the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric model]] in passing. 
*''[[The Whetstone of Witte]], whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmeteke: containing the extraction of rootes; the cossike practise, with the rule of equation; and the workes of Surde Nombers'' (London, 1557). This was the book in which the [[equals sign]] was introduced. With the publication of this book Recorde is credited with introducing [[algebra]] into England.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jourdain|first=Philip E. B.|year=1913|title=The Nature Of Mathematics}}</ref>
*a medical work, ''The Urinal of Physick'' (1548), frequently reprinted.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_urinal_of_physick.html?id=Sax491XagIgC&redir_esc=y ''The Urinal of Physick], by Robert Recorde, 1548; at [[Google Books]]</ref>

Sherburne states that Recorde also published ''Cosmographiae isagoge'', and that he wrote a book ''De Arte faciendi Horologium'' and another ''De Usu Globorum et de Statu temporum''. Recorde's chief contributions to the progress of algebra were in the way of systematizing its notation.
