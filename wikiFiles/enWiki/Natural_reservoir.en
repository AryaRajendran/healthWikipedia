{{other uses|Reservoir (disambiguation)}}

'''Natural reservoir''' or '''nidus''' (the latter from the Latin word for "nest") refers to the long-term [[host (biology)|host]] of the [[pathogen]] of an [[infectious disease]].<ref name="AguirreOstfeld2012" /> It is often the case that hosts do not get the disease carried by the pathogen or it is carried as a [[subclinical infection]] and so [[asymptomatic]] and non-lethal. Once discovered, natural reservoirs elucidate the complete life cycle of infectious diseases, providing effective [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] and control. Examples of natural reservoirs are:

* [[Apodemus|Field mice]], for [[hantavirus]]es and [[Lassa fever]]
* [[Marmot]]s, [[black rat]]s, [[prairie dog]]s, [[chipmunk]]s and [[squirrel]]s for [[bubonic plague]]
* [[Armadillo]]s and [[opossum]]s for [[Chagas disease]] and several species of [[New World]] [[Leishmania]]
* [[Tick]]s for [[babesiosis]] and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]
* Ground squirrels, [[porcupine]]s, and chipmunks for [[Colorado tick fever]]
* [[Snail]]s for [[schistosomiasis]] and [[swimmer's itch]]
* [[Pig]]s for [[Cestoda|cestode]] worm infections
* [[Raccoon]]s, [[skunks]], [[fox]]es and [[bat]]s for [[rabies]]
* [[Shellfish]] for [[cholera]]
* [[Fowl]] ([[duck]]s and [[goose|geese]]) for [[avian influenza]]
* [[Bat]]s, the reservoir for [[nipah]], [[hendra]], [[rabies]] and [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS)
* [[Dog]]s and wild [[canid]]s for ''[[Leishmania infantum]]'', the cause of infantile [[visceral leishmaniasis]]
* [[Cat]]s, for [[Bartonella]] (aka [[Cat scratch disease]])
* [[Gerbil]]s for ''[[Leishmania major]]'', the causative agent of [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] in the [[Old World]]
* [[Rock hyrax]] for ''[[Leishmania aethiopica]]'' and, probably, certain strains of ''[[Leishmania tropica]]'', the causative agents of [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] in the [[Old World]]

Some diseases have no non-human reservoir: [[poliomyelitis]] and [[smallpox]] are prominent examples.

The natural reservoir of some diseases remain unknown. This is the case of the [[Ebola]] disease, which is caused by a virus.<ref name="plospathogens06">{{cite web |authors=Biek, R, Walsh PD, Leroy EM, and Real LA |url=http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.0020090 |title=Recent Common Ancestry of Ebola Zaire Virus Found in a Bat Reservoir |date=27 Oct 2006 |accessdate=11 Feb 2013 |publisher=PLoS Pathogens}}</ref>
