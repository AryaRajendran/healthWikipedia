==Background==
[[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) was recognized as a clinical entity in the mid-1930s and now is the most prevalent upper [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) disorder in clinical practice. Around the same time, in 1934, Bray suggested a link between gut symptoms and airway disease. Acid-related laryngeal [[wiktionary:ulcer|ulceration]]s and [[granuloma]]s were first reported by Chery in 1968.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Cherry | first1 = J. | last2 = Margulies | first2 = SI. | title = Contact ulcer of the larynx. | journal = Laryngoscope | volume = 78 | issue = 11 | pages = 1937–40 | month = Nov | year = 1968 | doi = 10.1288/00005537-196811000-00007 | pmid = 5722896 }}
</ref> Subsequent studies suggested that acid reflux might be a contributory factor in other laryngeal and respiratory conditions. 
In 1979, Pellegrini and DeMeester were the first to document the link between these airway symptoms and reflux of gastric contents.  They also proved that treatment of reflux disease results in elimination of these airway symptoms.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Pellegrini | first1 = CA. | last2 = DeMeester | first2 = TR. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = LF. | last4 = Skinner | first4 = DB. | title = Gastroesophageal reflux and pulmonary aspiration: incidence, functional abnormality, and results of surgical therapy. | journal = Surgery | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 110–9 | month = Jul | year = 1979 | doi =  | pmid = 36677 }}</ref>

People who suffer from GERD usually have symptoms such as esophageal damage that result from the stomach acid shooting up into the [[esophagus]]. The acid can irritate the tissues of the esophagus resulting in a sore throat and persistent coughing. Patients who suffer from laryngopharyngeal reflux, or LPR, are more likely to experience symptoms as a result of stomach acid refluxing into the [[larynx]].

==Signs and symptoms==

Extraesophageal symptoms are the result of exposure of the upper aerodigestive tract to the gastric juice.  This causes a variety of symptoms, including [[hoarseness]], [[postnasal drip]], [[sore throat]], [[difficulty swallowing]], [[indigestion]], [[wheezing]], chronic [[cough]], [[globus pharyngis]] and chronic throat-clearing. Some people with LPR have heartburn, while others have little or none of this symptom. This is because the material that refluxes does not stay in the esophagus for very long. In other words, the acid does not have enough time to irritate the esophagus.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jamiekoufman.com/2010/01/08/silent-reflux-laryngopharyngeal-reflux-lpr-is-ubiquitous/ |title=Laryngopharyngeal Reflux ("Silent Reflux"): The Basics |first= |last= |work=jamiekoufman.com |year=2010 [last update] |accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

Adults who are afflicted with LPR often experience the acrid taste of bile emanating from the back of their [[throat]]. This is also likely to be accompanied by a lump-like sensation in the throat, making it difficult to swallow. The throat may also seem to burn and breathing can be difficult. These symptoms are most often prevalent just after waking.

==Diagnosis==

As there are multiple potential [[etiologies]] for the respiratory and laryngeal symptoms, establishing LPR as the cause based on symptoms alone is unreliable. Laryngoscopic findings such as [[erythema]], [[edema]], laryngeal granulomas, and interarytenoid hypertrophy have been used to establish the diagnosis; but these findings are very nonspecific, and have been described in the majority of asymptomatic subjects undergoing [[laryngoscopy]].<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hicks | first1 = DM. | last2 = Ours | first2 = TM. | last3 = Abelson | first3 = TI. | last4 = Vaezi | first4 = MF. | last5 = Richter | first5 = JE. | title = The prevalence of hypopharynx findings associated with gastroesophageal reflux in normal volunteers. | journal = J Voice | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 564–79 | month = Dec | year = 2002 | doi =  10.1016/S0892-1997(02)00132-7| pmid = 12512644 }}
</ref> Response to acid-suppression therapy has been suggested as a diagnostic tool for confirming diagnosis of LPR, but studies have shown that the response to empirical trials of such therapy (as with [[proton-pump inhibitors]]) in these patients is often disappointing.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Vaezi | first1 = MF. | last2 = Richter | first2 = JE. | last3 = Stasney | first3 = CR. | last4 = Spiegel | first4 = JR. | last5 = Iannuzzi | first5 = RA. | last6 = Crawley | first6 = JA. | last7 = Hwang | first7 = C. | last8 = Sostek | first8 = MB. | last9 = Shaker | first9 = R. | title = Treatment of chronic posterior laryngitis with esomeprazole | journal = Laryngoscope | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 254–60 | month = Feb | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1097/01.mlg.0000192173.00498.ba | pmid = 16467715 }}
</ref> Several studies have emphasized the importance of measuring proximal esophageal, or, ideally, pharyngeal acid exposure in patients with clinical symptoms of LPR, to document reflux as the cause of the symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sun G, Muddana S, Slaughter JC, ''et al.'' |title=A new pH catheter for laryngopharyngeal reflux: Normal values |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=119 |issue=8 |pages=1639–43 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19504553 |doi=10.1002/lary.20282 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ayazi S, Hagen JA, Zehetner J, ''et al.'' |title=Proximal esophageal pH monitoring: improved definition of normal values and determination of a composite pH score |journal=J. Am. Coll. Surg. |volume=210 |issue=3 |pages=345–50 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20193899 |doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2009.12.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1072-7515(09)01622-6}}</ref>

Before a diagnosis can be made, the doctor will need to record the patient’s medical history and may ask for details about the symptoms that the patient is experiencing. The doctor will then need to perform a physical examination with particular concentration around the head and [[neck]]. The doctor may need to use a specialized camera lens made of [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] strands. This is gently fed down the patient’s throat which then feeds back images to a monitor. This enables the doctor to get a clearer look at the throat, particularly the larynx. Tell-tale signs include redness, [[swelling]], and obvious irritation. Once a diagnosis is made, the doctor will propose a treatment method.

==Treatment==

Management of symptoms for patients within this subgroup of the [[GERD]] spectrum is difficult. Once these patients are identified, behaviorial changes including weight loss and dietary changes are advised. Further medical management using [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s is common practice, however even high doses of proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be ineffective in treating laryngopharyngeal reflux attributed symptoms and disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tamhankar AP, Peters JH, Portale G, ''et al.'' |title=Omeprazole does not reduce gastroesophageal reflux: new insights using multichannel intraluminal impedance technology |journal=J.
