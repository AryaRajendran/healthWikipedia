The '''Camelford water pollution incident''' involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of [[Camelford]], [[Cornwall]], [[England]] with 20 [[tonne]]s of [[aluminium sulphate]] in July 1988, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of [[sulphuric acid]] which "stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes."<ref name="cross">{{Cite news|title=Boiling water: Will a new inquiry on the Camelford poisoning get any nearer to the truth?|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=22 August 2001|first=Doug|last=Cross|pages=7}}</ref><ref name="irwin">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irwinmitchell.com/ClientStories/Pages/Camelford-Water-Pollution-Case.aspx|title=Camelford Water Pollution Case|work=IrwinMitchell LLP|date=|accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects,<ref name="Guardian-justice">{{Cite news|title=Still thirsting for justice|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/1999/jun/09/guardiansocietysupplement14|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=9 June 1999|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs|pages=4}}</ref> and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear {{As of|2012|lc=on}}.

On 6 July 1988 John Stephens, a relief tanker driver working for [[Bristol]]-based distribution firm ISC, arrived at [[Lowermoor Water Treatment Works]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] and found it unmanned.<ref name="wells2010">{{Cite news|title=Driver relives day of water poisoning|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=2 November 2010|first=Jeff|last=Wells|page=9}}</ref> Being unfamiliar with the location, he had been given a key by another driver and told simply that "once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left".<ref name="reid">{{Cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Sue|title=A lethal cover up: Britain's worst water poisoning scandal|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-502442/A-lethal-cover-Britains-worst-water-poisoning-scandal.html|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=14 December 2007|accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] (SWWA).

Douglas Cross, a [[biologist|consultant biologist]] based in Camelford, tested the water and found that it contained "not only aluminium sulphate but other noxious substances, too. As the acidic liquid travelled from the plant into people's homes, it corroded the copper pipes and their soldered joints, made of zinc and lead."<ref name=cross /><ref name=reid /> Official advice to boil the water before drinking was, according to Cross, "dangerous advice because it concentrates the contaminants. They kept flushing the pipes out for months after the incident. This will have stirred up debris in the bends and only have lengthened the amount of time the water was coming through the taps with all sorts of metals in it."<ref name=reid />
60,000 [[salmon]] and [[trout]] were killed in the [[River Camel|Camel]] and [[River Allen, Cornwall|Allen]] rivers during the flushing out process.<ref name="">{{Cite book|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-21771-2|title=The Environment: Principles and Applications|first=Chris|last=Park|pages=408}}</ref><ref name="jury">{{Cite news|title=Claimants consider 11th-hour pollution compensation offer|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=6 May 1994|first=Louise|last=Jury}}</ref> The contamination was compounded by the failure of the authority to carry out the required six-monthly cleaning of the tank, which had not been cleaned for three years leading to a build up of sludge.<ref name="gerrard">{{Cite news|title=What's happened to the children?|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date =14 July 1996|first=Nicci|last=Gerrard|pages=6}}</ref>

A month after the contamination, Michael Waring at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DH) wrote to every doctor in Cornwall saying that, "although he had no detailed information on what exactly was in the water or how much people might have drunk, he could assure them that no lasting ill effects would result."<ref name="meacher">{{Cite news|title=A wash out: Lessons must be learned from the notorious Camelford water contamination incident|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=26 April 2006|first=Michael|last=Meacher|pages=8|authorlink=Michael Meacher}}</ref> GK Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts should be sent to the area immediately but a month later said he had been "overruled".<ref name=meacher /> The [[National Union of Public Employees]] said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|privatisation plans]]. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been "instructed at a very high level to say nothing". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said "To single him out           is unfair".<ref name=dennis />

==Reports and inquiries==
In August 1988 a highly critical report by Dr John Lawrence, a senior [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] scientist and non-excutive member of the water authority, blamed lax procedures. He also criticised communication failures which kept information from the public.<ref name="dennis" />

===Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report===
The Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) was set up in January 1989 to provide expert advice to the [[District Health Authority#Authorities in South Western Region|Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority]] on the health implications for the population of the Camelford area.<ref name="hansard">{{Cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/20/lowermoor-incident-group|journal=[[Hansard]]|date=20 July 1989|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 20 July 1989 (cc298-9W)|volume=157|accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium and that there was no increase in ill health from poisoned water. A further enquiry by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused "real suffering" in the community.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/><ref name="skytimeline" /> However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that "In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events," and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of "inaccurate and exaggerated" claims of health damage by scientists and the news media.<ref name="rumbelow">{{Cite news|title=Camelford spill damaged brains, says doctor|work=The Times|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first=Helen|last=Rumbelow|pages=12}}</ref>  When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused "outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community."<ref name="vidal">{{Cite news|title=New inquiry into water poisoning: Minister promises to look again at Camelford|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|first=John|last=Vidal|pages=8}}</ref> One section was later amended to read "alarming statements by ''pseudo-''scientists" rather than "...by ''some'' scientists".<ref name=vidal />

The report, published on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, saying that the long-term health effects on the population were still unknown and that there was insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination.<ref name="brown2">{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry seeks new studies|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=27 January 2005|first=Paul|last=Brown|pages=11}}</ref> Woods called for further studies and said: "We will be putting the strongest possible case to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside."<ref name=brown2 /> The following year, Meacher made several criticisms of the group:
*the requirement to examine the DoH's handling of the incident was removed from the terms of reference
*no independent expert on aluminium toxicology was included in the working group
*an attempt was made to include Waring as medical adviser to the group, even though he was the author of the original letter stating that no lasting ill effects would result
*no objective testing of the exposed population was carried out
*too much reliance was placed on the water sample analysis from the South-West Water Authority, the compromised party
*the amount of sludge reported to have been in the contact tank at the time was ignored
*experts were drawn on who had potentially vested interests in the aluminium industry
*the DoH pre-released a highly misleading statement of the findings two days before the draft report was due to be made public
*the executive summary, prepared without the group's approval, and which effectively concluded that the illnesses reported bore no connection with the water poisoning, was "misleading and biased".<ref name=meacher />

Two members of the LSG committee claimed in December 2007 that the DoH had known from the start that some people were at especially high risk from aluminium poisoning but deliberately suppressed this evidence to protect the government's plans for water privatisation.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/dec/13/water.pollution1|title=Coroner orders police to reopen Camelford pollution case|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 December 2007|accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="yorkshire">{{Cite news|title=Police to investigate claims of water poisoning cover-up|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/police_to_investigate_claims_of_water_poisoning_cover_up_1_2484066|work=[[Yorkshire Post]]|location=Leeds|date=14 December 2007}}</ref>

===Short-term===
A diverse array of short term health effects was reported by members of the public who either drank the contaminated water or came into contact with it while bathing.<ref name="indyscandal" /><ref name="dennis">{{Cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Dennis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1988/oct/01/1|title=Official dismissed over contamination: Cornish manager made a scapegoat, says union|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 1988|accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=kent /> These included:

*hair turning blue or green,
*diarrhoea and vomiting, and
*[[arthralgia|joint pains]].

===Long-term===
A 1999 report in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' concluded that some victims had suffered "considerable damage" to their brain function.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Altmann| first = Paul | coauthors = John Cunningham, Usha Dhanesha, Margaret Ballard, James Thompson, and Frank Marsh| title = Disturbance of cerebral function in people exposed to drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulphate: retrospective study of the Camelford water incident|journal=BMJ|volume=319| issue = 7213|pages=807–811|date=25 September 1999|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7213/807| pmid = 10496822| pmc = 314205}}</ref> This contradicted the [[#Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report|1991 LIHAG report]] telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant [[nephrology|nephrologist]] at [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], [[Oxford]], and was the first large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of [[Alzheimer's disease]], which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain.<ref name=rumbelow /> Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the pollution incident.<ref name="court">{{Cite news|title=Brain damage found in pollution victims|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=24 September 1999|first=Chris|last=Court|pages=2}}</ref> Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.<ref name="laurance">{{Cite news|title=Contaminated water caused long-term brain damage in Camelford, say doctors study|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first1=Jeremy|last1=Laurance|first2=Cherry|last2=Norton|first3=Steve|last3=Boggan|pages=7}}</ref>

Seven months after the contamination, one victim underwent a bone biopsy which "found a ring of aluminium like the rings you see in trees" that could not have resulted from normal aluminium absorption.<ref name=boggan /><ref name=meacher />

===Later deaths of victims===
The husband of [[#Carol Cross|Carol Cross]], who died of a rare form of dementia in 2004, said in 2006 that he believed that his wife and twenty other people had died as a result of the disaster, and that more cases were emerging.<ref name="indyscandal" />

Victim Sarah Sillifant, who was in her twenties when she was exposed, hanged herself in 2005 after suffering dementia and other symptoms similar to those experienced by Carol Cross.<ref name="indyscandal" /> In June 2007, Irene Neal, who lived in Rock, near Camelford at the time of the incident, died aged 91. A post-mortem found an "unacceptable amount of aluminium in the brain".

====Carol Cross====
In 2006 a post-mortem [[inquest]] into the death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0&ndash;2 micrograms per gram. Her death was caused by a form of early-onset [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|beta amyloid angiopathy]], a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain.<ref name="savill">{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's symptoms in toxic water woman's brain|work=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 December 2005|first=Richard|last=Savill|pages=11}}</ref><ref name="liverpool">{{Cite news|title=Water link to Alzheimer's|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post|Daily Post]]|location=Liverpool)|date=16 December 2005|pages=7}}</ref> Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: "Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication."<ref name=liverpool /> Daniel Perl, of New York's [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] said: "If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important.

Rose had adjourned the inquests for Cross and Neal pending further studies, but in 2008 said the Government had refused "to either finance or assist" research to test the hypothesis of a link between exposure to aluminium and [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|congophilic amyloid angiopathy]]. He said this research was necessary to determine the consequences of the deceased having such a high level of aluminium. He later sought support from [[Somerset County Council]] so that the work could go ahead and once more adjourned the inquest into the death of Carol Cross, although Neal's inquest went ahead.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ministers refused cash for poisoned water probe|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|pages=22|year=2008|unused_data=6 September}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1052696/Coroner-slams-Government-refusing-fund-probe-deaths-worst-water-poisoning-cases-British-history.html|title=Government slammed for refusing to fund probe into death after one of worst water poisoning cases in British history|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=5 September 2008|accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Inquests: Camelford coroner attacks lack of state cash|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|first=Steven|last=Morris|pages=8|year=2008|unused_data=6 September}}</ref>

In July 2009 Rose announced that the inquest into Cross's death would resume in November 2010.<ref name="greenwood">{{Cite news|title=Coroner to quiz ex-water chief|work=Western Morning News|location=Plymouth|date=31 July 2009|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|pages=1}}</ref> Rose said that "ongoing medical research would not be completed until late summer" 2010. He explained "This research is necessary to prove whether or not the high level of aluminium in Mrs Cross's brain causing her death through beta amyloid angiopathy (a form of cerebrovascular disease) on February 19, 2004, could be attributed to the aluminium sulphate placed in the public water supply at Lowermoor treatment works on July 6, 1988. This is the last adjournment I am able to agree and the inquest will commence on Monday November 1, 2010 at Taunton."<ref name=greenwood />

When the inquest was reconvened Dr. Chris Exley, a reader in [[bioinorganic chemistry]] at [[Keele University]], said "The brain aluminium concentration was so high that it is highly likely that it contributed to her brain pathology, probably being responsible for the aggressive form and very early onset of the disease." [[Neuropathology|Neuropathologist]] Prof. Margaret Esiri, from the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], said "I have never seen a case such as this at this age. I have seen one case in a woman who died aged 81 but the literature shows only a handful of cases worldwide."<ref name="greenwood4">{{Cite news|title=Experts: Highly likely that polluted water caused death|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=9}}</ref> As a result of their evidence the inquest was again adjourned to allow South West Water Authority time to seek its own expert evidence.<ref name="greenwood5">{{Cite news|title=Poison in water 'led to death'|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=1}}</ref>

Carol Cross's inquest was finally completed in March 2012. The coroner returned a [[narrative verdict]] recording the circumstances without attributing the cause, in which he said the water supply company, [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable.

Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident," and that "[T]he failure of the authority to visit every house after the incident to advise them to thoroughly flush their systems [w]as a serious dereliction of duty.

==Legal actions against South West Water Authority==
In 1991 the South West Water Authority was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £25,000 costs at [[Exeter]] Crown Court for supplying water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least £123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost £400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in [[Truro]]. The settlements ranged from £680 to £10,000.<ref name=jury /><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1908534.stm|title=Camelford poisoning hearings begin|work=BBC News|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Water claims settled|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4650262.html|date=11 May 1994|accessdate=24 September 2011}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> Some later claimed they were "railroaded" into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their [[Legal aid#Legal aid in England and Wales|legal aid]] funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the law suit.<ref name="Guardian-justice" /> The judge, Mr Justice Wright, said: "If the case had been contested, there would have been awesomely complex argument over how much [water] they consumed" and that they were "extraordinarily well advised to accept the offer."<ref name="brown">{{Cite news|title=Residents accept pounds 400,000 from water company for pollution|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=11 May 1994|first=Paul|last=Brown}}</ref> Cross later said: "The official medical claim from the health authority was that there was no known pathway for aluminium to be absorbed into the body. I would argue that this was a misrepresentation of scientific facts, however it was accepted by the judge [and he] instructed the jury that medical damages could not be awarded. The victims therefore received negligible compensation. This alone is adequate reason for a judicial review, since it resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the victims."<ref name=cross />

==Allegations of a cover-up==
On 13 December 2007 Michael Rose announced that, in light of "a possible attempt to initially suppress the seriousness of the incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to hand me evidence gathered at the time of the original investigation," and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective "to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up."<ref name="bruxelles">{{Cite news|title=Coroner fears toxic water was covered up|work=The Times|location=London|date=14 December 2007|first=Simon|last=de Bruxelles|pages=25}}</ref> 

At the time of the incident the [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|water industry was about to be privatised]] by the [[Conservative]] government of the day; a letter written from a water official to [[Michael Howard]], then Minister of State for Water and Planning, emerged which stated that a police investigation into the poisoning incident was viewed as "very distracting" and that any subsequent prosecution of South West Water would also "be totally unhelpful to privatisation... and render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City".<ref name=reid /> The ''[[Western Morning News]]'', using a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request, uncovered a briefing note to the then Environment Minister, [[Nicholas Ridley]], warning: "Those of the South West board with a commercial background are deeply concerned by the investigation."<ref name=bnet />
There was speculation in the [[news media]] that commercial concerns were given priority over public health.<ref name=reid />

The former North Cornwall [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Paul Tyler, Baron Tyler|Paul (later Lord) Tyler]] also uncovered documents contradicting the water authority's claim that it had advised consumers not to drink the water, and that this advice had been given in a radio broadcast at 6am on 7 July 1988 and subsequently. The documents, relating to the prosecution of South West Water, alleged that this "was not the advice given to the public on the 6th, 7th, 8th, or indeed on the 12th," and added that the prosecution would say that the authority "misled Mr Healey (the head of the drinking water division at the Department of Environment)... There is evidence that a deliberate decision was made to conceal the truth from the public." <ref name="bnet">Western Morning News, Was there a Camelford cover-up?, 14 December 2007. [http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 Available over the Internet] by subscription</ref> Tyler said "I can't think of any comparable accident or mistake anywhere in Britain, particularly one involving what was a government agency, where there was no attempt to investigate what went wrong and why."<ref name="Guardian-justice" />

In 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher claimed that the Government feared what an unrestricted inquiry might find, and that "There was then a great deal of shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result they wanted. This inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down." No named individuals were ever prosecuted. 
The national water industry was sold, under the Conservative government, for £3.59 billion, with the sale of South West Water Authority raising around £300 million.<ref name=bnet />
