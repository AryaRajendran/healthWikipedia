'''Intermittent claudication''' (Latin: ''claudicatio intermittens'') is a clinical diagnosis given for muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue),<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000953879|intermittent claudication}}</ref> classically in the [[calf muscle]], which occurs during exercise, such as walking, and is relieved by a short period of rest.

Claudication derives from the Latin verb ''claudicare'', "to limp".

==Signs==
One of the hallmarks of arterial claudication is that it occurs intermittently. It disappears after a brief rest and the patient can start walking again until the pain recurs.
The following signs are general signs of atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries:

* [[cyanosis]]
* atrophic changes like loss of hair, shiny skin
* decreased [[temperature]]
* decreased [[pulse]]
* redness when limb is returned to a "dependent" position

All the "P"s
*'''P'''allor increase
*'''P'''ulses decreased
*'''P'''erishing cold
*'''P'''ain
*[[Paraesthesia|'''P'''araesthesia]]
*'''P'''aralysis

==Treatment==
Exercise can improve symptoms as can [[angioplasty]].<ref name=Review2012>{{cite journal|last=Frans|first=FA|coauthors=Bipat, S, Reekers, JA, Legemate, DA, Koelemay, MJ|title=Systematic review of exercise training or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for intermittent claudication.|journal=The British journal of surgery|date=2012 Jan|volume=99|issue=1|pages=16–28|pmid=21928409}}</ref> Both together may be better than one intervention of its own.<ref name=Review2012/>

Pharmacological options exist as well. Medicines that control lipid profile, [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]] may increase blood flow to the affected muscles and allow for increased activity levels. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE) inhibitors, [[beta-blockers]], antiplatelet agents ([[aspirin]] and [[clopidogrel]]), [[pentoxifylline]] and [[cilostazol]] (selective PDE3 inhibitor) are used for the treatment of intermittent claudication. However, medications will not remove the blockages from the body. Instead, they simply improve blood flow to the affected area.

[[Catheter]] based intervention is also an option. [[Atherectomy]], [[stent]]ing, and [[angioplasty]] to remove or push aside the arterial blockages are the most common procedures via catheter based intervention. These procedures can be performed by interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and thoracic surgeons, among others.

Surgery is the last resort; [[vascular surgeon]]s can perform either [[endarterectomy|endarterectomies]] on arterial blockages or perform an [[vascular bypass|arterial bypass]]. However, [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures#Open surgery|open surgery]] poses a host of risks not present with catheter-based interventions.

==Causes==
Most commonly, intermittent (or vascular or arterial) claudication  is due to [[peripheral arterial disease]] which implies significant [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic blockages]] resulting in arterial insufficiency.  It is distinct from [[neurogenic claudication]], which is associated with [[lumbar spinal stenosis]]. It is strongly associated with smoking, hypertension, and diabetes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dr Hicks|first=Rob|title=Intermittent Claudication|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/intermittentclaudication1.shtml|publisher=BBC Health}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Atherosclerosis affects up to 10% of the Western population older than 65 years and for intermittent claudication this number is around 5%. Intermittent claudication most commonly manifests in men older than 50 years.

One in five of the middle aged (65-75 years) population of the United Kingdom have evidence of peripheral arterial disease on clinical examination, although only a quarter of them have symptoms. The most common symptom is muscle pain in the lower limbs on exercise—intermittent claudication.<ref name="Edinburgh Artery Study">{{cite journal|title=Edinburgh Artery Study: prevalence of asymptomatic and symptomatic peripheral arterial disease in the general population|pmid=1917239|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1917239/}}</ref>
