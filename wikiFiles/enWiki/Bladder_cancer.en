'''Bladder cancer''' is any of several types of malignancy arising from the epithelial lining (i.e., the [[urothelium]]) of the [[urinary bladder]]. Rarely the bladder is involved by non-epithelial cancers, such as [[lymphoma]] or [[sarcoma]], but these are not ordinarily included in the colloquial term "bladder cancer." It is a disease in which abnormal cells multiply without control in the bladder.<ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/bladder-cancer Bladder cancer] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]</ref> The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine; it is located in the pelvis. The most common type of bladder cancer recapitulates the normal histology of the urothelium and is known as [[transitional cell carcinoma]] or more properly urothelial cell carcinoma. It is estimated that there are 383,000 cases of bladder cancer worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bladder — Estimated incidence, all ages: both sexes |work=GLOBOCAN 2008: Estimated cancer Incidence, Mortality, Prevalence and Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) Worldwide in 2008| publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), World Health Organization |url=http://globocan.iarc.fr/summary_table_site.asp?selection=1210&title=Bladder&age_from=1&age_to=10&sex=0&type=0&window=1&africa=1&america=2&asia=3&europe=4&oceania=5&build=6&sort=0&submit=%A0Execute%A0}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Bladder cancer characteristically causes blood in the urine.  This blood in the urine may be visible to the naked eye (gross/macroscopic [[hematuria]]) or detectable only by microscope (microscopic hematuria).  Hematuria is the most common symptom in bladder cancer.  

Other possible symptoms include [[Dysuria|pain during urination]], frequent urination, or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so.  These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, and are also caused by non-cancerous conditions, including [[prostate]] infections, over-active bladder and [[cystitis]].  There are many other cause of haematuria, such as bladder or ureteric stones, infection, kidney disease, kidney cancers and vascular malformations.

==Causes==
Tobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer; in most populations, smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/1097-0142(20000801)89:3<630::AID-CNCR19>3.0.CO;2-Q |author=Zeegers MP |last2=Tan |first2=FE |last3=Dorant |first3=E |last4=Van Den Brandt |first4=PA |title=The impact of characteristics of cigarette smoking on urinary tract cancer risk: a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies |journal=Cancer |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=630–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10931463}}</ref> There is a linear relationship between smoking and risk, and quitting smoking reduces the risk.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Boffetta P |title=Tobacco smoking and risk of bladder cancer |journal=Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl |volume=42 |issue=S218 |pages=45–54 |year=2008 |pmid=18815916 |doi=10.1080/03008880802283664}}</ref> Passive smoking has not been proven to be involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1013954932343 |author=Zeegers MP |last2=Goldbohm |first2=RA |last3=Van Den Brandt |first3=PA |title=A prospective study on active and environmental tobacco smoking and bladder cancer risk |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=83–90 |year=2002 |pmid=11899922}}</ref> 

In a 10-year study involving almost 48,000 men, researchers found that men who drank 1.5 liters of water per day had a significantly reduced incidence of bladder cancer when compared with men who drank less than 240mL (around 1 cup) per day. The authors proposed that bladder cancer might partly be caused by the bladder directly contacting carcinogens that are excreted in urine, although this has not yet been confirmed in other studies.<ref name="Brinkman M, Zeegers MP 2008 25–36">{{Cite journal|author=Brinkman M, Zeegers MP |title=Nutrition, total fluid and bladder cancer |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Urology and Nephrology.

Thirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens such as [[benzidine]]. [[2-Naphthylamine]], which is found in cigarette smoke, has also been shown to increase bladder cancer risk. Occupations at risk are bus drivers, rubber workers, motor mechanics, leather (including shoe) workers, blacksmiths, machine setters, and mechanics.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Reulen RC, Zeegers MP |title=A meta-analysis on the association between bladder cancer and occupation |journal=Scandinavian journal of urology and nephrology.

It has been suggested that mutations at [[HRAS]], [[KRAS2]], [[RB1]], and [[FGFR3]] may be associated in some cases.<ref>{{OMIM|109800}}</ref>

==Prevention==
A 2008 study commissioned by the World Health Organisation concluded that "specific fruit and vegetables may act to reduce the risk of bladder cancer."<ref name="Brinkman M, Zeegers MP 2008 25–36"/> Fruit and yellow-orange vegetables, particularly carrots and those containing selenium,<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70862-2 |author=Brinkman M, Zeegers MP |title=Use of selenium in chemoprevention of bladder cancer |journal=Lancet Oncol|volume= 7|issue=9 |pages=766–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16945772}}</ref> are probably associated with a moderately reduced risk of bladder cancer. Citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables were also identified as having a possibly protective effect.  However an analysis of 47,909 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study showed little correlation between cancer reduction and high consumption of fruits and vegetables overall, or yellow or green leafy vegetables specifically, compared to the statistically significant reduction among those men who consumed large amounts of cruciferous vegetables.

Several studies have suggested the bladder is one of the most responsive organs to induction of detoxification enzymes by extract. This was evident in human bladder cancer cells ''in vitro'' and in animal models ''in vivo''.  Sulforaphane and broccoli sprout extract were also observed to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human bladder cancer cells ''in vitro,'' an anti-cancer effect attributed to the sulforaphane potential in the sprouts.<ref>Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 1999, 91(7):605–613.</ref><ref>J. Nutrition, 2004, 134:2004–2010.</ref><ref>Mol. Cancer Ther., 2006, 5(4):935–944</ref><ref>Cancer Research, 2008, 68(5):1593–1600.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Blasentumor.jpg|thumb|Bladder tumor in FDG PET due to the high physiological FDG-concentration in the bladder, furosemide was supplied together with 200 MBq FDG. The uptake cranial to the lesion is a physiological uptake in the colon.]]
Many patients with a history, signs, and symptoms suspicious for bladder cancer are referred to a [[urology|urologist]] or other physician trained in [[cystoscopy]], a procedure in which a flexible tube bearing a camera and various instruments is introduced into the bladder through the [[urethra]]. Suspicious lesions may be biopsied and sent for [[surgical pathology|pathologic analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The gold standard for diagnosing bladder cancer is biopsy obtained during [[cystoscopy]]. Sometimes it is an incidental finding during cystoscopy.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Walid MS, Heaton RL |title=Can posthysterectomy cystoscopy be utilized as a screening test for bladder cancer? |journal=German Medical Science |volume=6 |pages=Doc13 |year=2008 |pmid=19675739 |pmc=2703254 |url=http://www.egms.de/en/gms/2008-6/000058.shtml}}</ref> Urine cytology can be obtained in voided urine or at the time of the cystoscopy ("[[bladder washing]]"). Cytology is very specific (a positive result is highly indicative of bladder cancer) but suffers from low sensitivity (inability of a negative result to reliably exclude bladder cancer). There are newer non-invasive urine bound markers available as aids in the diagnosis of bladder cancer, including human complement factor H-related protein, high-molecular-weight carcinoembryonic antigen, and nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Shariat et al. |title=Critical Evaluation of Urinary Markers for Bladder Cancer Detection and Monitoring |journal=Reviews in Urology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=120–135 |year=2008 |pmc=2483317|pmid=18660854|last2=Karam|first2=JA|last3=Lotan|first3=Y|last4=Karakiewizc|first4=PI }}</ref> NMP22 is also available as a prescription home test.  Other non-invasive urine based tests include the CertNDx Bladder Cancer Assay, which combines FGFR3 mutation detection with protein and DNA methylation markers to detect cancers across stage and grade, UroVysion, and Cxbladder. 

The diagnosing of bladder cancer can also be done with a [[Cysview]] guided [[fluorescence]] cystoscopy (blue light cystoscopy, Photodynamic diagnosis), as an adjunct to conventional white-light cystoscopy. This procedure improves the detection of bladder cancer and reduces the rate of early tumour recurrence, compared with white-light cystoscopy alone. Cysview cystoscopy detects more cancer and reduce recurrency. Cysview is marketed in Europe under the brand name [[Hexvix]] <ref>http://hexvix.com/about_hexvix.asp</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cysview.net/ |title=Photocure - Cysview Hexaminolevulinate (HCL) |publisher=Cysview.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref><ref>http://urotoday.com/bladder-cancer-1038/fluorescence-guided-transurethral-resection-of-bladder-tumours-reduces-bladder-tumour-recurrence-due-to-less-residual-tumour-tissue-in-t-at1-patients-a-randomized-two-centre-study-abstract.html Fluorescence-guided transurethral resection of bladder tumours reduces bladder tumour recurrence due to less residual tumour tissue in Ta/T1 patients</ref><ref>[http://www.biotekforum.no/article.php?articleID=724&categoryID=6 Hexvix guided fluorescence cystoscopy reduces recurrence in patients]</ref>

However, visual detection in any form listed above, is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification, cell type or the stage of the present tumor. A so-called cold cup biopsy during an ordinary cystoscopy (rigid or flexible) will not be sufficient for pathological staging either. Hence, a visual detection needs to be followed by transurethral surgery. The procedure is called transurethral resection (TUR). Further, [[bimanual exam]]ination should be carried out before and after the TUR to assess whether there is a palpable mass or if the tumour is fixed ("tethered") to the pelvic wall. The pathological classification obtained by the TUR-procedure, is of fundamental importance for making the appropriate choice of ensuing treatment and/or follow-up routines.<ref name="uroweb.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/ |title=European Association of Urology (EAU) - Guidelines - Online Guidelines |publisher=Uroweb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref>

===Pathological classification===
90% of bladder cancers are [[transitional cell carcinoma]].  The other 10% are [[squamous cell carcinoma]], [[adenocarcinoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[small cell carcinoma]], and secondary deposits from cancers elsewhere in the body.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

[[Carcinoma in situ]] (CIS) invariably consists of cytologically high grade tumour cells.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Screening==
As of 2010 there is insufficient evidence to determine if screening for bladder cancer in people without symptoms is effective or not.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chou R, Dana T |title=Screening adults for bladder cancer: a review of the evidence for the U.S. preventive services task force |journal=Ann.

==Treatment==
[[Image:Bladder Cancer Treatment Guide v4.png|thumb|Flow chart of the Bladder Cancer Treatment Guide]]
The treatment of bladder cancer depends on how deep the tumor invades into the bladder wall. Superficial tumors (those not entering the muscle layer) can be "shaved off" using an [[electrocautery]] device attached to a [[cystoscope]], which in that case is called a resectoscope. The procedure is called '''transurethral resection''' - TUR - and serves primarily for pathological staging. In case of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer the TUR is in itself the treatment, but in case of muscle invasive cancer, the procedure is insufficient for final treatment.<ref name="uroweb.org"/> [[Immunotherapy]] in the form of [[BCG as a treatment for bladder cancer|BCG instillation]] is also used to treat and prevent the recurrence of superficial tumors.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Alexandroff AB, Jackson AM, O'Donnell MA, James K |title=BCG immunotherapy of bladder cancer: 20 years on |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9165 |pages=1689–94 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10335805 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)07422-4}}</ref>

BCG immunotherapy is effective in up to 2/3 of the cases at this stage. Instillations of [[chemotherapy]], such as [[valrubicin]] (Valstar) into the bladder can also be used to treat BCG-refractory CIS disease when cystectomy is not an option.<ref>[http://www.valstarsolution.com/ Valstar Prescribing Information, available at]</ref>
[[Urocidin]] is phase III trials for this.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/bioniche-earns-4m-milestone-from-endo-following-positive-phase-iii-urocidin-data/81244253/ |title=Bioniche Earns $4M Milestone from Endo following Positive Phase III Urocidin Data |date=Nov 2010 }}</ref>

Patients whose tumors recurred after treatment with [[BCG]] are more difficult to treat.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Witjes JA |title=Management of BCG failures in superficial bladder cancer: a review |journal=European Urology |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=790–7 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16464532 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2006.01.017}}</ref> Many physicians recommend [[Cystectomy]] for these patients.

Untreated, superficial tumors may gradually begin to infiltrate the muscular wall of the bladder.  Tumors that infiltrate the bladder require more radical surgery where part or all of the bladder is removed (a [[cystectomy]]) and the urinary stream is diverted into an isolated bowel loop (called an ileal conduit or Urostomy).  In some cases, skilled surgeons can create a substitute bladder (a neobladder) from a segment of intestinal tissue, but this largely depends upon patient preference, age of patient, [[renal function]], and the site of the disease.

A combination of [[radiation]] and [[chemotherapy]] can also be used to treat invasive disease.  It has not yet been determined how the effectiveness of this form of treatment compares to that of radical ablative surgery.

Photodynamic diagnosis may improve surgical outcome on bladder cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Brien T, Thomas K |title=Bladder cancer: Photodynamic diagnosis can improve surgical outcome |journal=Nat Rev Urol |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=598–9 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=21068759 |doi=10.1038/nrurol.2010.183 }}</ref>

For muscleinvasive urothelial urinary bladder cancer there are a number of treatment options. Gold standard is radical cystectomy as mentioned. In males this usually includes also the removal of the prostate and in females; ovaries, uterus and parts of the vagina. In order to address the problem of micrometastatic disease which in itself has implications on longtime survival, new treatment options are dearly needed. Micrometastatic dissemination is often not treatable with only major surgery and the concept of [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]] has evolved. In a number of meta-analyses of randomised prospective trials worldwide, the results have shown survival benefits between 5–8% with this therapy, in a follow up time of 5 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Advanced Bladder Cancer (ABC) Meta-analysis Collaboration |title=Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive bladder cancer: update of a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data advanced bladder cancer (ABC) meta-analysis collaboration |journal=Eur.

In the United States, bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the ninth most common cancer in women. More than 50,000 men and 16,000 women are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year.
