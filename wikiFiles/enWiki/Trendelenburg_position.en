[[File:Trendelenburg-Lagerung.jpg|thumb|Old description of the Trendelenburg position.]]
In the  '''Trendelenburg position''' the [[human body|body]] is laid flat on the back ([[supine position]]) with the feet higher than the [[human head|head]] by 15-30 degrees, in contrast to the '''reverse Trendelenburg position''', where the body is tilted in the opposite direction. This is a standard position used in [[abdomen|abdominal]] and [[gynecology|gynecological]] [[surgery]]. It allows better access to the pelvic organs as [[gravity]] pulls the [[intestines]] away from the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. It was named after the German surgeon [[Friedrich Trendelenburg]].<ref name="whonamedit">{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/967.html|title=Trendelenburg's position|last=Enersen|first=Ole Daniel|publisher=Whonamedit.com|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> It is not recommended for the treatment of [[hypovolemic shock]].<ref>Emerg Med J 2010;27:877-878 {{doi|10.1136/emj.2010.104893}} http://emj.bmj.com/content/27/11/877.extract</ref>

==Uses==
* People with [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) have historically been placed in the Trendelenburg position in hopes of increasing their cerebral perfusion pressure (the blood pressure to the brain). A 2005 literature review found the "Literature on the position was scarce, lacked strength, and seemed to be guided by 'expert opinion.'"<ref name="pmid16120887">{{cite journal |author=Bridges N, Jarquin-Valdivia AA |title=Use of the Trendelenburg position as the resuscitation position: to T or not to T? |journal=Am.

* The Trendelenburg position was used for injured [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]].<ref name=UHMSabstract>{{cite journal |author=Stonier, JC |title=A study in prechamber treatment of cerebral air embolism patients by a first provider at Santa Catalina Island |journal=Undersea Biomedical Research |publisher=[[Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society]] |year=1985 |volume=12 |issue=1 supplement |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5498 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> Many experienced divers still believe this position is appropriate, but current scuba first aid professionals no longer advocate elevating the feet higher than the head.  The Trendelenburg position in this case increases regurgitation and airway problems, causes the brain to swell, increases breathing difficulty, and has not been proven to be of any value.<ref name=Dysbarism>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic154.htm |title=eMedicine - Dysbarism |author=Pulley, Stephen A |accessdate=2008-03-15 |work=}}</ref> "Supine is fine" is a good, general rule for victims of submersion injuries unless they have fluid in the airway or are breathing, in which case they should be positioned on the side.
* The Trendelenburg position is used in [[waterboarding]] to prevent water entering the lungs.
* Trendelenburg position is helpful in surgical reduction of an abdominal hernia.<ref name="pmid9445243">{{cite journal |author=Buchwald H |title=Three helpful techniques for facilitating abdominal procedures, in particular for surgery in the obese |journal=Am.

* The Trendelenburg position is also used when placing a [[Central Venous Line]].<ref name="Amesur">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/Radio/topic859.htm |title=eMedicine - Central Venous Access |author=Amesur, Nikhil B |accessdate=2008-03-15 |work=}}</ref> Trendelenburg position uses gravity to assist in the filling and distension of the upper central veins when placing a central line in the internal jugular or subclavian veins. It is also used in the placement of an external jugular peripheral line for the same reason. It plays no role in the placement of a femoral central venous line.
