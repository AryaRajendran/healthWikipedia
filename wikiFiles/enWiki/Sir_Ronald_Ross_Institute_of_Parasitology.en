In 1955, Satyanarayan Singh, a Professor of [[Zoology]] at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad's]] [[Osmania University]] acquired the building from the then Deccan Airlines and established the Malaria Research Institute in this building. Research scholars from [[Osmania University]] and [[Osmania Medical College]] worked here until the building was taken over by the [[Airports Authority of India]]. A pilot training center was set up in this building. Former [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Rajiv Gandhi]], was trained in this building. In 1979, Osmania University took over the building and continued research here.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us - Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Parasitology|url=http://www.osmania.ac.in/srrip/about%20us.htm|work=Osmania.ac.in|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>

== Restoration of the building's heritage ==
In 1935, the [[Secunderabad Cantonment Board]], the local civic agency, installed a marble tablet in appreciation of Ross’ achievement.<ref>{{cite news|title=World Mosquito Day celebrated|url=http://expressbuzz.com/cities/hyderabad/world-mosquito-day-celebrated/199912.html|accessdate=30 September 2010|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=21 August 2010}}</ref> In 1997, about 700 scientists from 30 countries gathered at this building to commemorate the centennial of Ronald Ross' discovery.<ref name="100_years">{{cite journal|last=Bagla|first=Pallava|title=Malaria Fighters Gather at Site of Early Victory|pmid=9304213|doi=10.1126/science.277.5331.1437 |journal=Science|date=5|year=1997|month=September|volume=277|issue=5331|pages=1437–1438|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/277/5331/1437|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Collis|first=Roger|title=Malaria:How Not to Get It|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/10/style/10iht-freq.t.html|accessdate=30 September 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 October 1997}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> On this occasion, the building was renovated at the cost of {{INRConvert|41|l}} by the [[British High Commission]].<ref name="world_meet_1"/> Being a heritage building, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] granted {{INR}} 6.5 lakhs for its further development. In addition, a plan was announced to convert the facility into a center of excellence and develop the landscape around the building.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ronald Ross Institute to be centre of excellence|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/08/21/stories/0421403u.htm|accessdate=30 September 2010|newspaper=The Hindu|date=21 August 2000}}</ref> Despite spending money on renovation, the building was not properly maintained.<ref>{{cite news|last=Saran|first=Suvir|title=Resurrecting a dying heritage|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040104/spectrum/heritage.htm|accessdate=30 September 2010|newspaper=[[The Tribune]]|date=4 January 2004}}</ref>

In 2008, the [[Government of Andhra Pradesh|state government]] formed a committee for the restoration, conservation and promotion of the building as tourist destination. A grant of {{INR}} 40 lakhs was to be utilized for developing a [[horticulture]] park and relocation of airport offices. Upon the completion of restoration, the [[Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|local tourism department]] was set to promote the building and its heritage as a destination for national and international tourists.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ross institute to be put on tourist map|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Hyderabad/Ross_institute_to_be_put_on_tourist_map/articleshow/3673898.cms|accessdate=30 September 2010|newspaper=The Times of India|date=5 November 2008}}</ref> Despite several attempts to revive the facility, the building lies secluded and devoid of academic or research activity and without steady source of financial support. Lack of political will and lack of bureaucracy was blamed for its current state.<ref name="collab">{{cite news|title=Ronald Ross Institute cries for attention|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/05/13/stories/2010051363770300.htm|accessdate=30 September 2010|newspaper=The Hindu|date=13 May 2010}}</ref>
