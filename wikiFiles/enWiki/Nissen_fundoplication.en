'''Nissen fundoplication''' is a [[surgical procedure]] to treat [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) and [[hiatus hernia]]. In GERD it is usually performed when medical therapy has failed, but with ''paraesophageal'' hiatus hernia, it is the first-line procedure. The Nissen fundoplication is total (360°), but partial fundoplications known as Belsey fundoplication (270° anterior transthoracic), Dor fundoplication (anterior 180-200°) or Toupet fundoplication (posterior 270°) are also alternative procedures with somewhat different indications.

==History==
Dr. Rudolph Nissen (1896–1981) first performed the procedure in 1955 and published the results of two cases in a 1956 ''Swiss Medical Weekly''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nissen R |title=[A simple operation for control of reflux esophagitis.] |language=German |journal=Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift |volume=86 |issue=Suppl 20 |pages=590–2 |year=1956 |pmid=13337262 |doi=}}</ref> In 1961 he published a more detailed overview of the procedure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nissen R |title=Gastropexy and "fundoplication" in surgical treatment of hiatal hernia |journal=The American journal of digestive diseases |volume=6 |issue= 10|pages=954–61 |year=1961 |pmid=14480031|doi=10.1007/BF02231426}}</ref>  Nissen originally called the surgery "gastroplication." The procedure has [[eponym|borne his name]] since it gained popularity in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stylopoulos N, Rattner DW |title=The history of hiatal hernia surgery: from Bowditch to laparoscopy |journal=Ann.

==Technique==
[[File:Watercolour of the Nissen-method.jpg|thumb|right|A completed Nissen fundoplication]]
In a ''fundoplication'', the [[gastric fundus]] (upper part) of the [[stomach]] is wrapped, or plicated, around the lower end of the [[esophagus]] and stitched in place, reinforcing the closing function of the [[lower esophageal sphincter]]. The esophageal hiatus is also narrowed down by sutures to prevent or treat concurrent hiatal hernia, in which the fundus slides up through the enlarged [[esophageal hiatus]] of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]. 

In a Nissen fundoplication, also called a complete fundoplication, the fundus is wrapped all the way 360 degrees around the esophagus. In contrast, surgery for [[achalasia]] is generally accompanied by either a ''Dor'' or ''Toupet'' partial fundoplication, which is less likely than a Nissen wrap to aggravate the [[dysphagia]] that characterizes achalasia.  In a Dor (anterior) fundoplication, the fundus is laid over the top of the esophagus; while in a Toupet (posterior) fundoplication, the fundus is wrapped around the back of the esophagus.

The procedure is now routinely performed [[laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]] and robotically using the [[da Vinci Surgical System]].
When used to alleviate gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in patients with [[delayed gastric emptying]], it is frequently combined with modification of the [[pylorus]] via [[pyloromyotomy]] or [[pyloroplasty]].

==Mechanism of relief==
Whenever the stomach contracts, it also closes off the esophagus instead of squeezing stomach acids into it.  This prevents the reflux of [[gastric acid]] (in GERD).

==Complications==
Nissen fundoplication is generally considered to be safe and effective, with a mortality rate of less than 1%.  Studies have shown that after 10 years, 89.5% of patients are still symptom-free.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Minjarez |first=RC |coauthors=Jobe BA |title=Surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease |journal=GI Motility online |doi=10.1038/gimo56 |url=http://www.nature.com/gimo/contents/pt1/full/gimo56.html|doi_brokendate=2008-06-21}}</ref>

Complications include "gas bloat syndrome", [[dysphagia]] (trouble swallowing), [[dumping syndrome]], excessive scarring, vagus nerve injury, and rarely, [[achalasia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Waring JP |title=Postfundoplication complications. Prevention and management |journal=Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=1007–19, viii–ix |year=1999 |pmid=10695014|doi=10.1016/S0889-8553(05)70102-3}}</ref> The fundoplication can also come undone over time in about 5-10% of cases, leading to recurrence of symptoms. If the symptoms warrant a repeat surgery, the surgeon may use [[Marlex]] or another form of artificial mesh to strengthen the connection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Curet MJ, Josloff RK, Schoeb O, Zucker KA |title=Laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux procedures |journal=Archives of surgery |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=559–63 |year=1999 |pmid=10323431|doi=10.1001/archsurg.134.5.559}}</ref> Postoperative irritable bowel syndrome, which lasts for roughly 2 weeks, is possible. 

In "gas bloat syndrome", fundoplication can alter the mechanical ability of the stomach to eliminate swallowed air by [[belching|belch]]ing, leading to an accumulation of gas in the [[stomach]] or small intestine.  Data varies, but some degree of gas-bloat may occur in as many as 41% of Nissen patients; whereas the occurrence is less with patients undergoing partial anterior fundoplication.<ref name="Booth">Booth, et al., What Is the Current Rate of Gas-Bloat Syndrome Following Open and Laparoscopic Antireflux Surgery?, o(eso Knowledge, http://www.hon.ch/OESO/books/Vol_6_Barrett_s_Esophagus/Articles/vol2/art023.html</ref>  Gas bloat syndrome is usually self-limiting within 2 to 4 weeks, but in some it may persist.  The offending gas may also come from dietary sources (especially carbonated beverages), or involuntary swallowing of air ([[aerophagia]]).  If postoperative gas-bloat syndrome does not resolve with time, dietary restrictions, and counselling regarding aerophagia, correction may be necessary, either by [[Esophageal dilatation|endoscopic balloon dilatation]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} or repeat surgery to revise the Nissen fundoplication to a partial fundoplication.<ref name="Booth" />

Vomiting is often difficult or even impossible with a fundoplication. In some cases, the purpose of this operation is to correct excessive vomiting. However, when its purpose is to reduce gastric reflux, difficulty in vomiting may be an undesired outcome. Initially, vomiting is impossible; however, small amounts of vomit may be produced after the wrap settles over time, and in extreme cases such as [[alcohol poisoning]] or [[food poisoning]], the patient may be able to vomit freely.
