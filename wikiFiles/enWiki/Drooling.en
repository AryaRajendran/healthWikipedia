'''Drooling''' (also known as '''driveling''', '''dribbling''', '''slobbering''', or, in a medical context, '''sialorrhea''') is the flow of [[saliva]] outside the [[mouth]]. Drooling can be caused by [[hypersalivation|excess production of saliva]], inability to retain saliva within the mouth (incontinence of saliva), or problems with swallowing ([[dysphagia]] or [[odynophagia]]).

Frequent and harmless cases are a numbed mouth from either [[Orajel]], or when going to the dentist office.

Isolated drooling in healthy infants and toddlers is normal and is unlikely to be a sign of either disease or complications. It may be associated with [[teething]]. Drooling in infants and young children may be exacerbated by [[upper respiratory infection]]s and [[nasal allergies]].

Some people with drooling problems are at increased risk of inhaling saliva, food, or fluids into the [[lungs]], mainly if drooling is secondary to a neurological problem. However, if the body's normal reflex mechanisms (such as [[gag reflex|gagging]] and [[cough]]ing) are not impaired, this is not life threatening. 

== Causes ==

Drooling or sialorrhea can happen in sleep. It is often the result of open-mouth posture from [[CNS depressants]] intake or sleeping on one's side. In sleep, saliva may not build at the back of the throat, triggering the normal swallow reflex, thus allowing for the condition.

[[Mercury poisoning]]

Drooling associated with [[fever]] or trouble swallowing may be a sign of an infectious disease including:

[[Retropharyngeal abscess]]

[[Peritonsillar abscess]]

[[Tonsilitis]]

[[EBV infectious mononucleosis|Mononucleosis]]

[[Strep throat]]

A sudden onset of drooling may indicate [[poison]]ing (especially by [[pesticide]]s or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]) or reaction to [[snake]] or [[insect]] [[venom (poison)|venom]]. Some [[medication]]s can cause drooling as well such as the pain relief medication [[Orajel]], by mucosa numbness. Some neurological problems also cause drooling. Excess Capsaicin can cause drooling as well, an example being the ingestion of particularly high [[Scoville Unit]] chili peppers.

<!--This is hypersalivation Another form of ptyalism is associated with pregnancy, most common in women with a condition known as '''Hyperemesis Gravidarium''', or uncontrollable and frequent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy which is far worse than typical "[[morning sickness]]". With Hyperemesis, ptyalism is a side-effect, which is a natural response to uncontrollable vomiting. With normal vomiting, salivary glands are stimulated to lubricate the oesophagus and mouth to aid in expelling of stomach contents. During a hyperemetic pregnancy, many woman complain of excessive saliva and an inability to swallow this saliva. Some women note having to carry around a "spitoon" or using a cup to spit. Swallowing their own saliva has been noted to gag and further nauseate the women making the hyperemesis that much worse.
There are several theories as to the causes of hyperemesis and related symptoms such as ptyalism.  Although hyperemesis was once considered a psychological disease, the medical community now considers hyperemesis as a real and serious physiological condition. Some pregnant women who suffer end up terminating the pregnancy.  Others refuse to carry another child. The most frequent act is preparing for the onset of hyperemesis if a subsequent pregnancy is expected. -->

==Home care==
Care for drooling due to teething includes good [[oral hygiene]]. [[Ice pop]]s or other cold objects (e.g., frozen [[bagel]]s) may be helpful. Care must be taken to avoid choking when a child uses any of these objects.

Drooling is also common in children with neurological disorders and those with undiagnosed developmental delay. The reason for excessive drooling seems to be related to
#Lack of awareness of the build-up of saliva in the mouth,
#Infrequent swallowing, 
#Inefficient swallowing,
#Impossibility of swallowing by obstructive diseases (tumors, stenosis),
#Impossibility of swallowing by neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral scleroris).

Treatment of excessive drooling is related to these causes:
#Increased awareness of the mouth and its functions,
#Increased frequency of swallowing,
#Increased swallowing skill,
#Diminishing of saliva production by the local use of botulinum toxin A,
#Surgical interventions (salivary duct relocalization, resection of salivary glands) in severe cases.

==Treatment==
A comprehensive treatment plan depends from the etiology and incorporates several stages of care: correction of reversible causes, behavior modification, medical treatment, and surgical procedures.  

[[Atropine sulfate]] tablets are used in some circumstances to reduce salivation. The same for [[anticholinergic]] drugs which can be also a benefit because they decrease the activity of the Acetylcholine Muscarinic Receptors and can result in decreased salivation. They may be prescribed by doctors in conjunction with behavior modification strategies. In general, surgical procedures are considered after proper diagnosis of the cause and evaluation of non-invasive treatment options. 

Some drugs had been used as [[glycopyrrolate]] and botulinum toxin A (Botox injection in salivary glands). <ref name="Neurology">{{cite web|url=http://www.neurology.org/content/61/9/1279.short|title=A randomized trial of botulinum toxin A for treatment of drooling|accessdate=02-10-2013|}}</ref>
