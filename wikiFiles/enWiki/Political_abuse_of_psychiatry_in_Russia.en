In 2005, [[Igor Kanterov]], a professor of the [[Moscow State University]], wrote that psychiatrists and psychologists were actually being involved in a very unattractive occupation, stigmatizing “alien” religions and their followers, who were about 1 million first-class citizens of the Russian Federation, and putting them “on the basis of a list of them” in the category of “psychic terrorists.”<ref name="Кантеров">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Кантеров|first=Игорь|title=Порочная методология и ее плоды|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2005|issue=№ 3|url=http://npar.ru/journal/2005/3/methodology.htm|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> While reviewing Sidorov’s article “Psychic terrorism is nonlethal weapon of mass destruction” published by ''Rossiyskiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal'' in its issue 3 of 2005, Kanterov notes that, according to it, religious behavior is regarded as inherently deviant from the “norm”, that similar type of behavior is always dependent and imposed by recruiting and manipulative influence and that, thus, the possibility to be initiated into religious organizations due to free choice of religious belief guaranteed by the [[Constitution of the Russian Federation]] is outright rejected.<ref name="Кантеров"/> In his 2010 article, Kanterov writes about the works by P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy that inspired by the desire to expose the malicious actions of “totalitarian cults,” P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy at the same time never resort to Russian laws regulating activity of religious associations, and it can hardly be considered accidental, since all the original sets of the authors are in flagrant contravention of current legislation.<ref name="Кантеров, 2010">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Кантеров|first=Игорь|title=На те же грабли|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2010|issue=№ 3|url=http://npar.ru/journal/2010/3/kanterov.htm|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> The Federal Law of the Russian Federation “On Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Associations” contains the following types of associations of believers: religious groups, religious organizations, local and centralized religious associations, and its legislator mentions about no “sects,” “cults,” especially with the frightening adjectives “destructive” or “totalitarian.”<ref name="Кантеров, 2010"/> However, in Kanterov’s words, peer-reviewed publications use the term “totalitarian sects” as a key concept that naturally generates psychiatric disorders and produces horror stories about “psychic terrorism,” “non-lethal weapon of mass destruction,” “usurpation of belongings and savings of followers,” “recruitment,” etc.<ref name="Кантеров, 2010"/> P.I. Sidorov presents a list of “totalitarian cults” with the names of over twenty religious organizations, and many of them have status of registered centralized organizations that successfully passed registration and re-registration provided by the Law “On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations” after the Expert Council for Religious Examination under the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation made for each of these organizations expert reports, in which the detailed assessment of the religious doctrine, rituals, attitude of the religious organizations to society, family, and individual were given, but no violations were found.<ref name="Кантеров, 2010"/>

In 2006, [[Yuri Savenko]] stated that a first large relapse of the use of psychiatry for political purposes in post-Soviet Russia during recent decade was struggle against “totalitarian sects.”<ref name="Технологии">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=Технологии использования психиатрии в немедицинских целях снова наготове|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|volume=|issue=№ 4|pages=|year=2006|issn=1028-8554|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2006/4/manual.htm}}</ref> According to Yuri Savenko, the reason for the use of psychiatry against religious minorities, which began from 1995, was [[Yuri Polishchuk|Y.I. Polishchuk]]'s report containing conclusion about “gross harm on mental health” inflicted by different religious organizations.<ref name="20-летие">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=20-летие НПА России|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|volume=|issue=№ 1|pages=5–18|year=2009|issn=1028-8554|url=http://www.npar.ru/pdf/2009-1.pdf}}</ref> This report was distributed to all public prosecutors’ offices of the country and the presidents of the educational institutions despite the fact that its scientific inadequacy was emphasized by not only the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] (the IPA), but also the [[Russian Society of Psychiatrists]] since all imputed cases of illness, suicide, family breakdown, etc. proved to be much more frequent in the general population than in the persecuted religious organizations.<ref name="20-летие"/> As the result of a series of court trials, it is only the vocabulary of the accusations that changed and became less clumsy; “destructive cults” started to be used instead of “totalitarian sects”; “unlawful use of hypnosis”, then “inconspicuous use of suggestion”, and, finally, “action at a subconscious level” through lectures and printed production with even anti-drug abuse contents started to be used instead of “gross harm on mental health”.<ref name="Технологии"/>

In 1999, the IPA expressed its concern about the facts of the use of psychiatry against religious minorities in the ''IPA Open Letter to the General Assembly of XI Congress of the WPA''.<ref name="Открытое письмо НПА">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|author=|title=Открытое письмо НПА Генеральной Ассамблее XI конгресса ВПА|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|volume=|issue=№ 3|page=49|year=1999|issn=1028-8554|url=}}</ref> Stressing all the responsibility taken by the authors of the letter for the action involved in their statement, they noted in it that they considered it necessary to draw the WPA General Assembly’s attention to the recurrent use of psychiatry for non-medical purposes, which was recommenced in Russia from 1994–1995, was subsequently going on a large-scale without slackening and was aimed at suppressing not political dissenters but already religious dissenters.<ref name="Открытое письмо НПА"/> This letter was concluded with the proposal, which was addressed to the WPA, to adopt the text of statement containing words of the WPA’s concern about initiating numerous lawsuits against various religious organizations in Russia for allegedly "inflicting by them gross harm on mental health and for unhealthy changes of personality" and to express in the statement the WPA’s solidarity with the position of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia and the Russian Society of Psychiatrists as to inadmissibility of involving psychiatrists in issues straining their professional competence.<ref name="Открытое письмо НПА"/>

In 2003, a “wrongful confinement” lawsuit, in which Yuri Savenko took part, was filed in the [[European Court of Human Rights]].<ref name="Brintlinger"/>{{rp|294}} When writing about this case, Savenko charged the [[Serbsky Institute]] with “having pernicious effect on Russian medicine” and warned that the psychiatric leadership “is now completely under the shadow of the state.”<ref name="Brintlinger"/>{{rp|294}}

Savenko’s organization cooperated with a number of other [[NGO]]s to compose a highly critical report about rising rates of mental disease and the deteriorating system of mental health care.<ref name="Brintlinger"/>{{rp|294}} In the report, authors blamed “chronic underfunding of psychiatric care, corruption, and poverty” and pointed an accusing finger at the psychiatric leadership.<ref name="Brintlinger"/>{{rp|294}}

In modern Russia, the role of psychiatry in the criminal field is the same as in other countries: to evaluate whether defendants in criminal cases are [[legally sane]] to stand trial. For example, when an accused war criminal [[Yuri Budanov]] was tested at the Moscow Serbsky Institute in 2002, the panel conducting the inquiry was led by Tamara Pechernikova, who had declared poet [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] insane several decades earlier. Budanov was found not guilty by reason of [[temporary insanity]], but later he was found legally sane to stand the trial by another panel that included [[Georgi Morozov]], the former Serbsky director who had declared many dissidents insane several decades earlier<ref name="Glasser"/>

Legal proceedings took place against the organization “F.A.K.E.L.-P.O.R.T.O.S.”, a youth commune of the similar type as [[Anton Makarenko]]’s one. The organization was engaged in self-improvement of its members and re-education of street children and created successful farms under [[Kharkov]] and [[Moscow]]. In 2000, the commune was smashed up by Luberetskiy RUBOP, with gross violations of law, the members of the organization was wrongly accused of creating “an illegal paramilitary group.” In particular, Yuriy Davydov was sentenced to imprisonment and compulsory treatment with a diagnosis of “schizophrenia, delusional ideas of [[perestroika]] and reformation of society” made by the [[Serbsky Center]].<ref name="Политическое дело">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|title=Политическое дело аполитичной организации и психиатрия: нестандартное решение Центра им.

The charge that psychiatry is again being abused is not universally accepted within the profession in Russia.
