'''Mycobacterial cervical lymphadenitis''', also known as '''scrofula''', refers to a [[lymphadenitis]] of the cervical [[lymph nodes]] associated with [[tuberculosis]] as well as non tuberculous (atypical) mycobacteria.

==Disease==
[[Image:Scrofula.jpeg|thumb|Scrofula of the neck]]
Scrofula is the term used for lymphadenopathy of the neck, usually as a result of an infection in the [[lymph nodes]], known as [[lymphadenitis]]. It can be caused by tuberculous or non tuberculous mycobacteria. About 95% of the scrofula cases in adults are caused by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', most often in [[immunocompromised]] patients (about 50% of cervical tuberculous lymphadenopathy). In immunocompentent children, scrofula is often caused by atypical mycobacteria (''[[Mycobacterium scrofulaceum]])'' and other nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Unlike the adult cases, only 8% of cases in children are tuberculous. 

With the stark decrease of tuberculosis in the second half of the 20th century, scrofula became a less common disease in adults, but remained common in children. With the appearance of [[AIDS]], however, it has shown a resurgence, and presently affects about 5% of severely immunocompromised patients.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Signs and symptoms===
The most usual signs and [[symptom]]s are the appearance of a chronic, painless mass in the [[neck]], which is persistent and usually grows with time. The mass is referred to as a "cold abscess", because there is no accompanying local color or warmth and the overlying skin acquires a violaceous (bluish-purple) color. NTM infections do not show other notable constitutional symptoms, but scrofula caused by tuberculosis is usually accompanied by other symptoms of the disease, such as [[fever]], [[chill]]s, [[malaise]] and [[weight loss]] in about 43% of the patients. As the lesion progresses, skin becomes adhered to the mass and may rupture, forming a [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinus]] and an open [[wound]].

==Diagnosis==
[[medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] is usually performed by [[needle aspiration biopsy]] or excisional [[biopsy]] of the mass and the histological demonstration of stainable [[acid-fast]] bacteria in the case of infection by ''M. tuberculosis'' ([[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]), or the culture of NTM using specific growth and staining techniques.

===Pathology===
The classical histologic pattern of scrofula features caseating granulomas with central acellular necrosis (caseous necrosis) surrounded by granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells. Although tuberculous and non tuberculous lymphadenitis are morphologically identical, the pattern is somewhat distinct from other causes of bacterial lymphadenitis. <ref> Rosado FG, Stratton CW, Mosse CA Clinicopathologic correlation of epidemiologic and histopathologic features of pediatric bacterial lymphadenitis. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2011 Nov;135(11):1490-3. http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.5858/arpa.2010-0581-OA </ref>

==Therapy==
Treatments are highly dependent on the kind of infection. Surgical excision of the scrofula does not work well for ''M. tuberculosis'' infections, and has a high rate of [[recurrence]] and formation of [[fistula]]e. Furthermore, surgery may spread the disease to other organs. The best approach is to use conventional [[tuberculosis treatment|treatment of tuberculosis]] with [[antibiotics]]. Scrofula caused by NTM, on the other hand, responds well to [[surgery]], but is usually resistant to antibiotics. The affected nodes can be removed either by repeated aspiration, [[curettage]] or total excision (with the risk in the latter procedure, however, often causing unsightly scarring, damage to the [[facial nerve]], or both).

==Prognosis==
With adequate treatment, clinical remission is practically 100%. In NTM infections, with adequate surgical treatment, clinical remission is greater than 95%. It is recommended that persons in close contact with the diseased person, such as family members, be tested for tuberculosis.

== History ==
'''Scrofula''' ('''scrophula''' or '''struma''') is any of a variety of [[skin disease]]s; in particular, a form of [[tuberculosis]], affecting the [[lymph node]]s of the neck. In adults it is caused by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and in children by [[nontuberculous mycobacteria]]. The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''scrofula'', meaning ''brood [[sow]]''.

In the [[Middle Age]]s it was believed that "royal touch", the touch of the [[sovereign]] of [[England]] or [[France]], could cure diseases due to the [[divine right of kings|divine right of sovereigns]]. Scrofula was therefore also known as the ''King's Evil''. From 1633, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Church]] contained a ceremony for this, and it was traditional for the [[monarch]] (king or queen) to present to the touched person a [[coin]]&nbsp;– usually an [[Angel (coin)|Angel]], a [[gold]] coin the value of which varied from about 6 [[shilling]]s to about 10 shillings. In England this practice continued until the early 18th century. King [[Henry IV of France]] is reported as often touching and healing as many as 1,500 individuals at a time.

[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] touched the infant [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1712,<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Henry Hitchings]]|title=Dr Johnson's Dictionary: The Extraordinary Story of the Book that Defined the World|publisher=John Murray|year=2005|page=11}}</ref> but [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] put an end to the practice as being "too [[Catholic]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The kings of France continued the custom until [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] stopped it in the 18th century, though it was briefly revived to universal derision in 1825.

In the 18th century, Elizabeth Pearson, an Irish herbalist, proposed a treatment for scrofula involving herbs and a poultice and extract of vegetable; and in 1815, [[Sir Gerard Noel]] presented a petition to the House of Commons advocating her treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|date=3 July 1815|title=PETITION OF MRS. PEARSON RESPECTING HER DISCOVERY FOR THE CURE OF SCROFULA, OR KING'S-EVIL|journal=[[Hansard]]|volume=31|pages=1086–7|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1815/jul/03/petition-of-mrs-pearson-respecting-her}}</ref>

In 1768 the Englishman John Morley produced a handbook ''Essay on the Nature and Cure of Scrophulous Disorders, Commonly Called the King's Evil''.  The book starts by listing the typical symptoms and indications of how far the disease had progressed.  It then goes into detail with a number of case studies, describing the specific case of the patient, the various treatments used and their effectiveness.  The forty-second edition was printed in 1824.

In 1924, French historian [[Marc Bloch]] wrote a book<ref>Bloch, M. (Anderson, J. E., trans), ''The Royal Touch: Sacred Monarchy and Scrofula in England and France (Les Rois Thaumaturges)'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, (London), 1973.</ref> on the history of the royal touch: ''The Royal Touch: Sacred Monarchy and Scrofula in England and France'' (original in French).
