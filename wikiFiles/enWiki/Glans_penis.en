In male human anatomy, the '''glans penis''' (or simply '''glans''', {{IPAc-en|g|l|æ||n|z|}})<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref> is the sensitive bulbous structure at the [[distal]] end of the [[human penis|penis]]. The glans is anatomically [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the [[clitoral glans]] of the human female. Typically, the glans is completely or partially covered by the [[foreskin]], except in men who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]], though the foreskin can generally be retracted over and past the glans.

The glans is also commonly referred to as the "head of the penis", while common [[British slang]] terms include "helmet" and "bell end" in reference to its distinctive shape. The medical name comes from the [[Latin]] word ''glans'' ('acorn') and ''penis'' ('of the penis')&nbsp;– the Latin [[Genitive case|genitive]] of this word has the same form as the [[Nominative case|nominative]].

==Medical considerations==
The [[external urethral orifice (male)|meatus]] (opening) of the [[urethra]] is located at the tip of the glans penis. In [[circumcision|circumcised]] infants, the [[foreskin]] no longer protects the meatal area of the glans; consequently, when wearing [[diaper]]s, there may be greater risk of developing meatitis, meatal ulceration, or [[meatal stenosis]].<ref name="freud">{{cite journal | last = Freud | first = Paul | year = 1947 | month = August | title = The ulcerated urethral meatus in male children | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–41 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(47)80098-8 | url =http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/freud1/ | accessdate = 2006-07-07 | pmid = 20256409 }}</ref>

The [[epithelium]] of the glans penis is [[Mucocutaneous zone|mucocutaneous]] tissue.<ref name="halata2">{{cite journal | last = Halata | first = Zdenek | coauthors =A.

Inflammation of the glans penis is known as [[balanitis]]. It occurs in 3–11% of males, and up to 35% of diabetic males. Edwards reported that it is generally more common in males who have not been circumcised and who have poor hygiene.<ref name="edwards">{{cite journal | last = Edwards | first = Sarah | year = 1996 | month = June | title =Balanitis and balanoposthitis: a review | journal = Genitourinary Medicine | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–9 | pmid = 8707315 | url =http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/edwards1/ | pmc = 1195642 }}</ref> It has many causes, including irritation, or infection with a wide variety of pathogens. Careful identification of the cause with the aid of patient history, physical examination, swabs and cultures, and biopsy are essential in order to determine the proper treatment.<ref name="edwards"/>

==Anatomical details==
The glans penis is the expanded cap of the [[corpus spongiosum]]. It is moulded on the rounded ends of the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa penis]], extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. At the summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical external urethral orifice. The circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the [[corona glandis]], overhanging a deep retroglandular [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]] (the ''coronal sulcus''), behind which is the neck of the penis. The proportional size of the glans penis can vary greatly. On some penises it is much wider in circumference than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, and on others it is narrower and more akin to a probe in shape. 

The foreskin maintains the mucosa in a moist environment.<ref name="prakash">{{cite journal | last = Prakash | first = Satya | coauthors = Raghuram Rao, K. Venkatesan & S. Ramakrishnan | year = 1982 | month = July | title = Sub-Preputial Wetness--Its Nature | journal = Annals of National Medical Science (India) | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 109–112 | url =http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/prakash/}}</ref> In males who have been circumcised, the glans is permanently exposed and dry.

Halata & Spathe (1997) reported that "the glans penis contains a predominance of free nerve endings, numerous genital [[Bulboid corpuscles|end bulbs]] and rarely [[Pacinian corpuscle|Pacinian]] and [[Ruffini ending|Ruffinian]] corpuscles. [[Merkel nerve ending]]s and [[Meissner's corpuscle]]s are not present."<ref name="halata2"/>

Yang & Bradley argue that "the distinct pattern of innervation of the glans emphasizes the role of the glans as a sensory structure".<ref name="yang"/>

==Evolutionary significance==
It has been suggested that the unique and unusual shape of the glans in humans has evolved to serve the function of "scooping" any remnant [[semen]] deposited by other rival males out of the deeper part of the [[vagina]] of a female who may have recently copulated, and thereby decreasing the chance of the rival male from impregnating the female.<ref name="gallup">{{cite journal | last = Gallup | first = Gordon | coauthors = Rebecca L. Burch, Mary L. Zappieri, Rizwan A. Parvez, Malinda L. Stockwell, Jennifer A. Davis | year = 2003 | month = July | title = The human penis as a semen displacement device | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 277–289 | url =http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/ens/article/PIIS1090513803000163/abstract | doi = 10.1016/S1090-5138(03)00016-3}}</ref> Other theorists{{Who|date=April 2009}} suggest that its distinctive shape evolved to heighten the sexual pleasure experienced by the female during vaginal intercourse. In this theory, the glans increases friction and tension at the mouth of the [[vagina]] by its additional girth and the dilating properties of its probe-like shape.
