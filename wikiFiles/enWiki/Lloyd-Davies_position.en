It is also known as the [[Trendelenburg position]] with legs apart. The basic angle is a 30-degree Trendelenburg with the hips flexed at 15 degrees; this can be adjusted with leg supports.

==Advantages==
# The position gives good exposure and minimizes pressure areas for longer surgeries.
# It has less side effects of neuropathies as compared to other positions.

==Disadvantages==
# It can precipitate compartment syndrome in muscles of calves after 5 or more hours of surgery.<ref>http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/fulltext/1998/12000/effect_of_various_lithotomy_positions_on.14.aspx</ref>
