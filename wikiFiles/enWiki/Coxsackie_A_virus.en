'''Coxsackie A virus ''' is a cytolytic [[coxsackie virus]] of the ''[[Picornaviridae]]'' family, an [[enterovirus]] (a group containing the [[poliovirus]]es, coxsackieviruses, and [[echovirus]]es).

==Diseases==
The most well known Coxsackie A disease is [[Hand, foot and mouth disease]] (unrelated to [[hoof and mouth disease]]), a common childhood illness which affects mostly children aged 5 or under,<ref>[http://www.sarawak.health.gov.my/hfmd.htm Untitled Document<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> often produced by Coxsackie A16. In most cases infection is [[asymptomatic]] or causes only mild symptoms. In others, infection produces short-lived (7â€“10 days) [[fever]] and painful [[blister]]s in the mouth (a condition known as ''[[herpangina]]''), on the palms and fingers of the hand, or on the soles of the feet. There can also be [[blister]]s in the throat, or on or above the [[tonsil]]s. Adults can also be affected.  The rash, which can appear several days after high temperature and painful sore throat, can be itchy and painful, especially on the hands/fingers and bottom of feet.

Other diseases include acute haemorrhagic [[conjunctivitis]] (A24 specifically), [[herpangina]], and aseptic [[meningitis]] (both Coxsackie A and B viruses).

==Treatment==
Treatment is dependent on the disease process initiated by the virus.

There is no known cure or vaccine against the coxsackie.
