==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of asthma}}

Asthma is the result of chronic [[inflammation]] of the airways which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding [[smooth muscle]]s.<!-- <ref name=GINA2011p2/> --> This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing.<!-- <ref name=GINA2011p2/> --> The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment.<!-- <ref name=GINA2011p2/> --> Occasionally the airways themselves change.<ref name=GINA2011p2/> Typical changes in the airways include an increase in [[eosinophils]] and thickening of the [[lamina reticularis]].<!-- <ref name=M38/> --> Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands.<!-- <ref name=M38/> --> Other cell types involved include: [[T lymphocytes]], [[macrophages]], and [[neutrophils]].<!-- <ref name=M38/> --> There may also be involvement of other components of the [[immune system]] including: [[cytokines]], [[chemokines]], [[histamine]], and [[leukotrienes]] among others.<ref name=M38/>

==Diagnosis==
While asthma is a well recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.<ref name=M38/> It is defined by the [[Global Initiative for Asthma]] as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment".<ref name=GINA2011p2 />

An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an ''asthma attack''. The classic symptoms are [[shortness of breath]], [[wheeze|wheezing]], and [[chest tightness]].<ref name=M38/> While these are the primary symptoms of asthma,<ref name=Barnes2008>{{cite book|last=Barnes |first=PJ |chapter=Asthma |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|editor1-last=Fauci|editor1-first=Anthony S |editor2-last=Braunwald |editor2-first=E, |editor3-last=Kasper|editor3-first=DL |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2008 |edition=17th |isbn=978-0-07-146633-2|pages=1596–1607}}</ref> some people present primarily with [[cough]]ing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard.<ref name=BTS58/>

Signs which occur during an asthma attack include the use of accessory [[muscle]]s of respiration ([[sternocleidomastoid]] and [[scalene muscles]] of the neck), there may be a [[pulsus paradoxus|paradoxical pulse]] (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.<ref name=Maitre1995>{{cite journal |author=Maitre B, Similowski T, Derenne JP |title=Physical examination of the adult patient with respiratory diseases: inspection and palpation |journal=Eur.

[[Acute severe asthma]], previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids.<ref name=Shah2012/> Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.<ref name=Shah2012>{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=R|coauthors=Saltoun, CA|title=Chapter 14: Acute severe asthma (status asthmaticus).|journal=Allergy and asthma proceedings : the official journal of regional and state allergy societies|date=2012 May–Jun|volume=33 Suppl 1|pages=S47-50|pmid=22794687}}</ref>

Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures, is a commonly reported [[occupational disease]].<ref name=Baur2012/> Many cases however are not reported or recognized as such.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kunnamo|first=ed.-in-chief: Ilkka|title=Evidence-based medicine guidelines|year=2005|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-01184-3|page=214|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=frYEiHYtOv0C&pg=PA214}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kraft|first=editors, Mario Castro, Monica|title=Clinical asthma|year=2008|publisher=Mosby / Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-323-07081-2|pages=Chapter 42|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=y9WYwLVn7pgC&pg=PT1185}}</ref> It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work–related.<!-- <ref name=Baur2012/> --> A few hundred different agents have been implicated with the most common being: [[isocyanates]], grain and wood dust, [[colophony]], [[soldering flux]], [[latex]], animals, and [[aldehydes]].<!-- <ref name=Baur2012/> --> The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include: those who [[spray paint]], bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, [[welders]], hairdressers and timber workers.<ref name=Baur2012>{{cite journal|last=Baur|first=X|coauthors=Aasen, TB; Burge, PS; Heederik, D; Henneberger, PK; Maestrelli, P; Schlünssen, V; Vandenplas, O; Wilken, D; ERS Task Force on the Management of Work-related, Asthma|title=The management of work-related asthma guidelines: a broader perspective.|journal=European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society|date=2012 Jun 1|volume=21|issue=124|pages=125–39|pmid=22654084}}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma.<!-- <ref name=NAEPP46/> --> In children, other upper airway diseases such as [[allergic rhinitis]] and [[sinusitis]] should be considered as well as other causes of airway obstruction including: [[Foreign_body#Airways|foreign body aspiration]], [[tracheal stenosis]] or [[laryngotracheomalacia]], [[vascular ring]]s, enlarged [[lymph nodes]] or neck masses.<!-- <ref name=NAEPP46> --> In adults, [[COPD]], [[congestive heart failure]], airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors should be considered.<!-- <ref name=NAEPP46> --> In both populations [[vocal cord dysfunction]] may present similarly.<ref name=NAEPP46>{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=46}}</ref>

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma.  After the age of 65 most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD.  In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi.  However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, and smoking cessation.<ref name=Gibson>{{cite journal |author=Gibson PG, McDonald VM, Marks GB |title=Asthma in older adults |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9743 |pages=803–13 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20816547 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61087-2 }}</ref> It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.<ref name=Hargreave>{{cite journal | author1=Hargreave FE |author2=Parameswaran K |title=Asthma, COPD and bronchitis are just components of airway disease |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=264–267 |month=August |year=2006 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/28/2/264.full |pmid=16880365 |doi=10.1183/09031936.06.00056106 }}</ref><ref name="Applied Therapeutics 2009">{{cite book|author=Diaz, P.

==Prevention==
The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.<ref name="NHLBI07p184"/> Some show promise including: limiting smoke exposure both [[in utero]] and after delivery, [[breastfeeding]], and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.<ref name="NHLBI07p184">{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|pp=184–5}}</ref> Early pet exposure may be useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lodge|first=CJ|coauthors=Allen, KJ; Lowe, AJ; Hill, DJ; Hosking, CS; Abramson, MJ; Dharmage, SC|title=Perinatal cat and dog exposure and the risk of asthma and allergy in the urban environment: a systematic review of longitudinal studies.|journal=Clinical & developmental immunology|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=176484|pmid=22235226}}</ref> Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=CM|coauthors=Tischer, C; Schnappinger, M; Heinrich, J|title=The role of cats and dogs in asthma and allergy—a systematic review.|journal=International journal of hygiene and environmental health|date=2010 Jan|volume=213|issue=1|pages=1–31|pmid=20053584}}</ref> and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.<ref name=Au2005/> Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.<ref name=Au2005>{{cite journal|last=Prescott|first=SL|coauthors=Tang, ML; Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and, Allergy|title=The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy position statement: Summary of allergy prevention in children.|journal=The Medical journal of Australia|date=2005 May 2|volume=182|issue=9|pages=464–7|pmid=15865590}}</ref> Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.<ref name=Baur2012/>

The treatment plan should be written down and advise adjustments to treament according to changes in symptoms.<ref name=GINA_2011_page56>{{harvnb|GINA|2011|p=56}}</ref>

The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as [[Health effects of tobacco smoking|cigarette smoke]], pets, or [[aspirin]], and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended.  Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.<ref name=NHLBI07p213>{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=213}}</ref><ref name=BGMA08>{{cite web |url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign101.pdf |title=British Guideline on the Management of Asthma|format=PDF|publisher=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080819203455/http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign101.pdf| archivedate= 19 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Bronchodilators]] are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms.<!-- <ref name=NAEPP/> --> In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed.<!-- <ref name=NAEPP/> --> If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, an oral [[leukotriene antagonist]] or a [[mast cell stabilizer]] is recommended.<!-- <ref name=NAEPP/> --> For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, oral corticosteroids are added to these treatments.<ref name="NHLBI07p214">{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=214}}</ref>

===Lifestyle modification===
Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include [[allergen]]s, smoke (tobacco and other), air pollution, [[Beta_blocker#Nonselective_agents|non selective beta-blockers]], and sulfite-containing foods.<ref name=NAEPP2007p69>{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=69}}</ref><ref name=thomson>{{cite journal |author=Thomson NC, Spears M |title=The influence of smoking on the treatment response in patients with asthma |journal=Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 |year=2005 |pmid=15643345 |doi=10.1097/00130832-200502000-00011}}</ref> Cigarette smoking and [[second-hand smoke]] (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.<ref name=Stap2011>{{cite journal| author=Stapleton M, Howard-Thompson A, George C, Hoover RM, Self TH| title=Smoking and asthma. | journal=J Am Board Fam Med | year= 2011 | volume= 24 | issue= 3 | pages= 313–22 | pmid=21551404 | doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.03.100180}}</ref> Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.<ref name=Gotzsche2008>{{cite journal |author=[[Peter C.

===Medications===
Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.<ref name="NHLBI07p213">{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=560}}</ref>

Medications are typically provided as [[metered-dose inhaler]]s (MDIs) in combination with an [[asthma spacer]] or as a [[dry powder inhaler]]. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug.  A [[nebulizer]] may also be used.
