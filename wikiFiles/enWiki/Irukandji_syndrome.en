'''Irukandji syndrome''' is a condition induced by [[venom]]ization by the sting of ''[[Carukia barnesi]]'', a species of [[Irukandji jellyfish]], and certain other [[box jellyfish]].<ref name="Jellyfishresponsible-Little">{{cite journal | title = Jellyfish Responsible for Irukandji Syndrome | journal = Q J Med | volume = 99 | issue = 6 | pages = 425–427 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/hcl057 | pmid = 16687419 | author = Little M, P.

==Early experience==
In 1964, Jack Barnes confirmed the cause of the syndrome was a sting from a small [[box jellyfish]]: the [[Irukandji jellyfish]], which can fire venom-filled stingers out of its body and into passing victims. To prove that the jellyfish was the cause of the syndrome, he captured one and deliberately stung himself, his  son, and a local lifeguard, and observed the resulting symptoms.<ref name="MJA1964-Barnes">{{cite journal | author = Barnes J | title = Cause and effect in Irukandji stingings | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 897–904 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14172390}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid1998-14.html|title=Stingy Scientist|publisher=darwinawards.com|accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref> Other cubozoans possibly can cause Irukandji syndrome,<ref name="AnnEmergMed2003-Grady">{{cite journal | author = Grady J, Burnett J | title = Irukandji-like syndrome in South Florida divers | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 763–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14634600 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-0644(03)00513-4}}</ref> but only seven jellyfish are positively identified (''[[Carukia barnesi]]'', [[Alatina mordens|''Alatina'' cf. ''mordens'']], ''[[Carybdea alata]]'', ''[[Malo maximus]]'', ''[[Malo kingi]]'', ''[[Carybdea xaymacana]]'', an as-yet unnamed "fire jelly", and another unnamed species).<ref name="Jellyfishresponsible-Little"/><ref name="MJA2003-Little">{{cite journal | title = Another cause of "Irukandji stingings" | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 179 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 654 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14636148 | author = Little M, [[Jamie Seymour|J.

==Toxicity==
When properly treated, a single sting is normally not fatal; however, two people in Australia are believed to have died from Irukandji stings,<ref name="MJA2002-Fenner">{{cite journal | title = Fatal envenomation by jellyfish causing Irukandji syndrome | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 177 | issue = 7 | pages = 362–3 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12358578 | author = P. Fenner, J. Hadok}}</ref> which has greatly increased public awareness of Irukandji syndrome. It is unknown how many other deaths from Irukandji syndrome have been wrongly attributed to other causes.<ref name="MJA2002-Fenner"/> The exact mechanism of action of the venom is unknown, but [[catecholamine]] excess may be an underlying mechanism in severe cases.<ref name="ClinAutonRes 1998-Burnett">{{cite journal | title = Autonomic neurotoxicity of jellyfish and marine animal venoms | journal = Clin Auton Res | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–30 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9613803 | doi = 10.1007/BF02267823 | author = J. Burnett, D. Weinrich, J. Williamson, P. Fenner, L. Lutz, D. Bloom}}</ref> Animal studies appear to confirm a relationship between envenoming and an increase in circulating  [[noradrenaline]] and [[adrenaline]].<ref name="AnaesthIntensiveCare2001-Tibballs">{{cite journal | title = Mechanism of cardiac failure in Irukandji syndrome and first aid treatment for stings | journal = Anaesth Intensive Care | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 552 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11669442 | author =  J.Tibballs, G. Hawdon, K. Winkel}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Most stings occur during the summer wet season in October-May in North Queensland, with different seasonal patterns elsewhere.<ref name="AnnEmergMed2009-Nickson">{{cite journal | author = Nickson CP, Waugh EB, Jacups S, Currie B | title = Irukandji syndrome case series from Australia’s tropical Northern Territory | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 395–403 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19409658 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.03.022}}</ref> Because the jellyfish is very small, and the venom is only injected through the tips of the [[nematocyst]]s (the [[cnidocyst]]s) rather than the entire lengths, the sting may barely be noticed at first. It has been described as feeling like little more than a [[mosquito]] bite. The symptoms, however, gradually become apparent and then more and more intense in the following five to 120 minutes (30 minutes on average). Irukandji syndrome includes an array of systemic symptoms, including severe [[headache]], [[backache]], muscle pains, chest and [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[sweating]], [[anxiety]], [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]] and [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name="MJA1964-Barnes"/><ref name="AnnEmergMed2009-Nickson" /><ref name="AnaesthIntensiveCare2003-Little">{{cite journal | author = Little M, Pereira P., Mulcahy R., Cullen P., Carrette T., Seymour J. | title = Severe cardiac failure associated with presumed jellyfish sting.

==Treatment==
Similar to other [[box jellyfish]], first aid consists of flushing the area with [[vinegar]] to neutralize the tentacle stinging apparatus. As no [[antivenom]] is available, treatment is largely supportive, with [[analgesia]] being the mainstay of management. [[Histamine antagonist|Antihistamines]] may be of benefit for pain relief,<ref name="MJA1998-Little">{{cite journal | author = Little M, Mulcahy R | title = A year's experience of Irukandji envenomation in far north Queensland | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 169 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 638–41 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9887916}}</ref> but most cases require [[intravenous]] [[opioid]] analgesia. [[Fentanyl]] or [[morphine]] are usually chosen. [[Pethidine]], (meperidine, brand name Demerol in the US) should be avoided, as large doses are often required for pain relief and in this situation significant adverse effects from the pethidine [[Metabolomics#Metabolites|metabolite]] norpethidine may occur.<ref name="MJA2003-Bailey">{{cite journal | author = Bailey P, Little M, Jelinek G, Wilce J | title = Jellyfish envenoming syndromes: unknown toxic mechanisms and unproven therapies | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 178 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12492389}}</ref>

[[Magnesium sulfate]] has been proposed as a treatment for Irukandji syndrome after being apparently successfully used in one case.<ref name="MJA2003-Corkeron">{{cite journal | author = Corkeron M | title = Magnesium infusion to treat Irukandji syndrome | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 178 | issue = 8 | pages = 411 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12697017}}</ref> Early evidence suggested a benefit;<ref name="AnaesthIntensiveCare 2004-Corkeron">{{cite journal | author = Corkeron M, Pereira P, Makrocanis C | title = Early experience with magnesium administration in Irukandji syndrome | journal = Anaesth Intensive Care | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 666–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15535491}}</ref> however, according to a later report, a series of three patients failed to show any improvement with magnesium; the author reiterated the experimental status of this treatment.<ref name="AnaesthIntensiveCare2004-Little">{{cite journal | author = Little M | title = Failure of magnesium in treatment of Irukandji syndrome | journal = Anaesth Intensive Care | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–2 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119507}}</ref>

==Geographic distribution==
Reports of Irukandji syndrome have come from [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]], [[Florida]], the [[French West Indies]], [[Bonaire]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Timor Leste]] and [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name="MJA1964-Barnes"/><ref name="AnnEmergMed2009-Nickson" />  Cubozoan species other than ''Carukia barnesi'' are presumed to be responsible for envenomations outside Australia.<ref name="Jellyfishresponsible-Little"/>

==Media demonstrations==
The severity of the pain from an [[Irukandji jellyfish]] sting is apparent in the 2005 [[Discovery Channel]] documentary ''Killer Jellyfish''<ref>{{cite episode |title=Killer Jellyfish |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139594/ |series=Killer Jellyfish |credits= |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |station= |airdate=2005}}</ref> about ''[[Carukia barnesi]]'', when two Australian researchers ([[Jamie Seymour]] and Teresa Carrette) are stung. Even under the "maximum dose of morphine", Carrette remarked  she "wished she could rip her skin off", and is later seen writhing uncontrollably from the pain while lying on her hospital bed. In one scene, her feet are shown contorting and digging into the bed, and she is wiggling her toes and kicking her feet around. When the camera moves back, she is seen rubbing her face, her body is contorting in agony, and her legs are rapidly sliding and kicking around on the bed. Seymour, at his worst, is also seen writhing in pain, curled up in a ball and barely able to speak. He said he wished that he was stung by ''[[Chironex fleckeri]]'', instead, since "the pain goes away in 20 minutes or you die".

Another recent program aired on the Discovery Channel, ''Stings, Fangs and Spines'', featured a 20-minute spot on Irukandji syndrome. In the segment, a young Australian woman was stung and developed a severe case. In a testament to the severity of pain involved, a re-enactment (featuring the actual victim portraying herself) shows her screaming and violently thrashing around on the hospital bed in an almost convulsive state, for the bulk of the segment. She later commented that this unbearable pain lasted for hours, and added, "I didn't think it was possible for anyone to endure that level of pain without turning into a vegetable."

On the television program ''Super Animal'', a woman compared her pain from [[childbirth]] to her experience with Irukandji syndrome: "It's like when you're in labor, having a baby, and you've reached the peak of a contraction—that absolute peak—and you feel like you just can't do it anymore. That's the minimum that [Irukandji] pain is at, and it just builds from there."
