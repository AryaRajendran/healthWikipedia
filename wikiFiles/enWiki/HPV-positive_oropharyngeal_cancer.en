'''[[Human papillomavirus]] (HPV)-positive [[oropharyngeal cancer]] (OPC)''' also known as '''HPV16+ oropharyngeal cancer''' or '''HPV+ OPC''' is a recognized subtype of Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC),<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s12105-009-0100-y}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10793107}}</ref><ref name="2009review"/> associated with the HPV type 16 virus.

==Causes==
HPV oral infection precedes the development of HPV+ OPC.<ref name="anil"/><ref name="Mannarini">{{cite pmid|20140157}}</ref> Slight injuries in the mucous membrane serve as an entry gate for HPV, which thus works into the basal layer of the epithelium.<ref name="Petr"/><ref>{{cite pmid|19010263}}</ref> People testing positive for HPV16 oral infection have a 14 times increased risk of developing HPV+ OPC.<ref name="Petr"/>

[[Immunosuppression]] seems to be an increased risk factor for HPV+ OPC.<ref name="Mannarini"/>  Individuals with [[TGF beta 1|TGF-β1]] genetic variations, specially T869C, are more likely to have HPV16+ OPC.<ref>{{cite pmid|20179236}}</ref> TGF-β1 plays an important role in controlling the immune system. 

A 1999 study has found that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital cancers had a 4.3-fold increased risk of tonsillar squamous-cell carcinoma.<ref>{{cite pmid|10543674}}</ref>

Although evidence suggests that HPV16 is the main cause of OPC between non-smokers and non-drinkers, the degree to which tobacco and/or alcohol use may contribute to increase the risk of HPV+ OPC is unclear.<ref name="Mannarini"/>

<!-- Men have higher prevalence of oral HPV infection than women.<ref name="anil"/> -->
Concomitant [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|human herpesvirus-8]] infection can potentiate the effects of HPV-16.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1080/00016480801965001}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
A prospective study has found that increased HPV+ OPC risk was observed more than 15 years after HPV exposure,<ref name="anil"/> pointing to a slow development of the disease, like in cervical cancer.

HPV associated cancers are caused by the expression of HPV's E6 and E7 proteins that bind to and inactivate tumor suppressor proteins [[p53]] and [[retinoblastoma protein]] (pRB), respectively, leading to malignant transformation of HPV infected cells.<ref name="anil"/><ref>{{cite pmid|20499310}}</ref>

The biology of HPV+ OPC is distinct of HPV- OPC with [[P53]] degradation (inactivated by E6 instead of by genetic mutation), pRB pathway inactivation (by E7 instead of [[Cyclin D1]] amplification), and [[p16 (gene)|P16]] upregulation (over-expression of p16 instead of inactivation due to reduced negative feedback from pRB).<ref name="Marur"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscap.org/site~/99th/pdf/companion04h03.pdf|title=Molecular Assessment of HPV in Patients with Head and Neck Tumors|last=Hunt|first=Jennifer L.|date=25 February  2010|accessdate=13 May 2010|format=PDF}}</ref>

The tonsils epithelia ([[Palatine tonsils|palatine]] and [[Lingual tonsils|lingual]]) share similar [[stratified squamous epithelium|nonkeratinization]] characteristic with the [[Cervix#Histology|cervix]], where HPV infection play the major role in cases of [[cervical cancer]].<ref name="Petr"/><ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/annonc/mdp380}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
HPV+ OPC is usually diagnosed at a more advanced [[Cancer staging|stage]] than HPV- OPC.<ref name="anil"/>

Genetic signatures of HPV+ and HPV- OPC are different.<ref>{{cite pmid|19223504}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19221247}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/path.2227}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.otohns.2009.04.014}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17079134}}</ref> 

HPV OPC is associated with expression level of the [[Human_papillomavirus#Cancer|E6/E7 mRNAs]] and of [[CDKN2A|p16]].<ref>{{cite pmid|19795456}}</ref>  Nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma strongly predicts HPV-association.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s12105-009-0126-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16504868}}</ref><!-- adding as a commentary: HPV16 E6/E7-positive cases were histopathologically characterized by their verrucous or papillary structure and koilocytosis of the adjacent mucosa.<ref>{{cite pmid|19787251}}</ref>
High-risk HPV types may be associated with oral carcinoma, by cell-cycle control dysregulation, contributing to oral carcinogenesis and the overexpression of mdm2, p27 and cathepsin B.<ref>{{cite pmid|19811804}}</ref>
-->

HPV OPC is not merely characterized by the presence of HPV-16. Only the expression of viral oncogenes within the tumor cells plus the serum presence of E6 or E7 antibodies is unambiguously conclusive.<ref name="Petr">{{cite pmid|20445705}}</ref>

There's not a standard HPV testing method in head and neck cancers,<ref>{{cite pmid|20227331}}</ref> both [[in situ hybridization]] and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] are commonly used.<ref name="Marur">{{cite pmid|20451455}}</ref><ref name="Eva"/> A 2010 study has concluded that both have comparable performance for HPV detection, however it's important to use appropriate sensitivity controls.<ref>{{cite pmid|20551264}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Risk factors are high number of sexual partners,<ref name="Schwartz">{{cite pmid|9811312}}</ref><!--country specific (>= 4)--><ref name="Smith"/><!--country specific(2.7 6>25 partners)--><ref name="DSouza"/> (25% increase >= 6 partners)<ref name="world">{{cite pmid|20022926}}</ref> 
history of oral-genital sex,<!--country specific (4.3 >= 1 partner),--><ref name="Smith">{{cite pmid|14696105}}</ref><!--country specific (3.8 1>5 partners)--><ref name="DSouza">{{cite pmid|17494927}}</ref> (125% >= 4 partners)<ref name="world"/> history of [[anal–oral sex]],<ref name="Smith"/> female partner had a history of either an abnormal [[Pap smear]] or a [[cervical dysplasia]],<ref name="Smith"/><ref>{{cite pmid|11201683}}</ref> frequent marijuana use,<ref>{{cite pmid|18334711}}</ref> chronic [[periodontitis]],<ref>{{cite pmid|19380363}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19745222}}</ref> and, among men, decreasing age at first intercourse<ref name="Schwartz"/> and history of genital warts.<ref name="Schwartz"/>

A 2010 study concluded that current tobacco users with advanced HPV+ OSCC are at higher risk of disease recurrence compared with never-tobacco users.<ref>{{cite pmid|20145161}}</ref>

[[HPV vaccine]]s have a theoretical potential to prevent oral HPV infection.<ref name="anil"/>

A 2010 review study has found that HPV16 oral infection was rare (1.3%) among the 3,977 healthy subjects analyzed.<ref>{{cite pmid|20081557}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Currently HPV+ OPC are treated similarly to stage-matched and site-matched unrelated OPC. However less intensive use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, as well as specific therapy, is under research.<ref name="2009review">{{cite doi|10.1097/CCO.0b013e328329ab64}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|20493569}}</ref> <!-- primary research It's believed that better results of radiation and cisplatin is caused by an induced immune response not by tumor increased epithelial sensitivity.<ref>{{cite pmid|19917928}}</ref>-->

It's hypothesized that HPV+ OPC patients benefit better from radiotherapy and concurrent [[cetuximab]] treatment than HPV- OPC patients receiving the same treatment.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S1470-2045(10)70035-8}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Tumor HPV status is strongly associated with positive therapeutic response and survival compared with HPV-negative OPC.<ref name="fak">{{cite pmid|18270337}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|20346528}}</ref><ref name="ang">{{cite pmid|20530316}}</ref> A possible explanation is "the lower probability of occurrence of 11q13 gene amplification, which is considered to be a factor underlying faster and more frequent recurrence of the disease"<ref name="Petr"/> Presence of TP53 mutations, a marker for HPV- OPC, is associated with worse prognosis.<ref name="anil"/>

High grade of p16 staining is thought to be better than HPV PCR analysis in predicting radiotherapy response.<ref name="Eva">{{cite book|last1=Munck-Wikland|first1=Eva|last2=Hammarstedt|first2=Lalle |last3=Dahlstrand|first3=Hanna|editor=M.

==Epidemiology==
HPV+ OPC patients tend to be younger than HPV- patients.<ref>{{cite pmid|20553531}}</ref> Currently in the US there is a growing incidence of HPV associated oropharyngeal cancers,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/cncr.22963}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|

The higher increase incidence of HPV associated OPC is also seen in other countries, like [[Sweden]], with a 2007 incidence of over 80% for cancer in the tonsils,<ref>{{cite pmid|19330833}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://diss.kib.ki.se/2008/978-91-7357-587-4/thesis.pdf|title=Tonsillar Cancer - Incidence, Prevalence of HPV and Survival|last=Hammarstedt|first=Lalle|year=2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|location=Stockholm|format=PDF|isbn=978-91-7357-587-4}}</ref> [[Finland]]<ref>{{cite doi|10.1136/jcp.2003.008656}}</ref> and [[Czech Republic]].<ref>{{cite pmid|15888110}}</ref> 

In Australia  incidence of HPV associated OPC is 1.56 cases per 100,000 males/year.<ref>{{cite pmid|20226244}}</ref>

==History==
In 1983, it was first suggested<ref name="Mannarini"/> that HPV might be the agent involved in the development of at least certain special types of oral cancers.<ref>{{cite pmid|6325356}}</ref> In 2007 the [[World Health Organization]] stated HPV was a cause for oral cancers.<ref name="anil">{{cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Anil|coauthors=Maura L.
