'''[[Vitamin E]] deficiency''' causes neurological problems due to poor nerve conduction.

==Presentation==
Signs of vitamin E deficiency include neuromuscular problems such as [[spinocerebellar ataxia]] and [[myopathy|myopathies]].<ref name=Traber>{{cite journal |author=Brigelius-Flohé R, Traber MG |title=Vitamin E: function and metabolism |journal=FASEB J. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1145–55 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10385606 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10385606}}</ref> Other neurological signs may include [[dysarthria]], absence of [[deep tendon reflex]]es, loss of [[vibratory sensation]] and [[proprioception]], and positive [[Babinski sign]].<ref name=Traber/>

Deficiency can also cause [[anemia]] due to oxidative damage to red blood cells,<ref name=Traber/> [[retinopathy]]<ref name=sheet>{{Cite web| publisher=National Institutes of Health |author=Office of Dietary Supplements |title=Vitamin E Professional Fact Sheet |url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamine.asp#h3 |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=board>Institute of Medicine.

There is also some laboratory evidence that vitamin E deficiency can cause [[male infertility]].<ref name=Traber/>

==Causes==
Vitamin E deficiency is rare and is almost never caused by a poor diet.<ref name=Traber/> Instead, there are three specific situations when a vitamin E deficiency is likely to occur. It is seen in persons who cannot absorb dietary fat, has been found in premature, very low birth weight infants (birth weights less than 1500 grams, or 3.5 pounds), and is seen in individuals with rare disorders of fat metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Traber MG, Sies H |title=Vitamin E in humans: demand and delivery |journal=Annu. Rev. Nutr. |volume=16 |pages=321–47 |year=1996 |pmid=8839930 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.16.070196.001541}}</ref>

Very low birth weight infants may be deficient in vitamin E. A [[neonatologist]], a [[pediatrician]] specializing in the care of newborns, typically evaluates the nutritional needs of premature infants.

[[Abetalipoproteinemia]] is a rare inherited disorder of fat metabolism that results in poor absorption of dietary fat and vitamin E.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Muller DP, Lloyd JK, Wolff OH |title=Vitamin E and neurological function: abetalipoproteinaemia and other disorders of fat absorption |journal=Ciba Found. Symp. |volume=101 |issue= |pages=106–21 |year=1983 |pmid=6557902}}</ref> The vitamin E deficiency associated with this disease causes problems such as poor transmission of nerve impulses, muscle weakness, and degeneration of the retina that can cause blindness. Individuals with abetalipoproteinemia may be prescribed special vitamin E supplements by a physician to treat this disorder. In addition, there is a rare genetic condition termed isolated vitamin E deficiency or ataxia with isolated with vitamin E deficiency, caused by mutations in the gene for the tocopherol transfer protein.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Manor D, Morley S |title=The alpha-tocopherol transfer protein |journal=Vitam. Horm. |volume=76 |issue= |pages=45–65 |year=2007 |pmid=17628171 |doi=10.1016/S0083-6729(07)76003-X}}</ref> These individuals have an extremely poor capacity to absorb vitamin E and develop neurological complications that are reversed by high doses of vitamin E.

==Treatment==
Individuals who cannot absorb fat may require a vitamin E supplement because some dietary fat is needed for the absorption of vitamin E from the gastrointestinal tract. Anyone diagnosed with [[cystic fibrosis]], individuals who have had part or all of their stomach removed, and individuals with malabsorptive problems such as [[Crohn's disease]], [[liver disease]] or [[Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency|pancreatic insufficiency]] may not absorb fat and should discuss the need for supplemental vitamin E with their physician. People who cannot absorb fat often pass greasy stools or have chronic diarrhea and bloating.
