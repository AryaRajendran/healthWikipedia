'''Deepak Pandya''' (born December 6, 1932) is a [[neuroanatomist]] who is best known for his contributions to the understanding of cortical and subcortical brain connectivity in the macaque using tract-tracing methods.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/06/21/dad_proud_as_shuttle_heads_home/ Dad proud as shuttle heads home]</ref> He was born at Julasan, [[Mehsana District]], [[Gujarat]] in [[India]]. He was orphaned, but completed his I.S. in 1953 from [[Gujarat University]] in India. After obtaining his M.D. degree from Gujarat University in 1957 (and interning in V.S. Hospital in [[Junagadh]] till 1958), he went to the [[United States]] and did his internship and residency training in Medicine in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. 

In 1964, Pandya joined the Department of [[Anatomy]] at [[Case Western Reserve University]], as a postdoctoral [[fellow]]. He moved to Boston in 1966 and joined the [[Aphasia]] Research Center at the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center, and the Departments of [[Anatomy]] and [[Neurology]] at [[Boston University]] School of Medicine as an Assistant [[Professor]]. During his [[postdoctoral]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] and subsequent period in Boston, Pandya focused his research investigations on cortico-[[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] connections. In 1969 his laboratory moved to Boston City Hospital. During this time he was appointed as a lecturer in Experimental [[Neuropathology]] at Harvard Medical School, and he participated in teaching the [[Neuroscience]] course at both schools. In 1973, Pandya joined the Veterans Administration Medical Center in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]], as a staff internist.  He practiced clinical medicine while continuing his research studies and teaching, until his retirement in 1995. After this, Pandya moved his office to the Department of [[Anatomy]] & [[Neurobiology]] at Boston University School of Medicine.

Pandya, along with many colleagues, has made significant contributions in the field of connectivity of [[cerebral cortex]]. Several postdoctoral and Ph.D. students have received training under Pandya. His research works have been internationally recognized and he has presented his work in conferences in North America and Europe. Currently he is continuing his research studies on comparative brain [[architectonics]] in the [[monkey]] and humans, as well as connectional studies in the monkey.

Pandya and his [[Slovenian American]] wife, Bonnie, are the parents of astronaut [[Sunita Williams]].
