==Measure of nicotine exposure==
Cotinine has an [[in vivo]] [[half-life]] of approximately 20 hours, and is typically detectable for several days (up to one week) after the use of [[tobacco]]. The level of cotinine in the [[blood]] is proportionate to the amount of exposure to tobacco smoke, so it is a valuable indicator of tobacco smoke exposure, including [[passive smoking|secondary (passive) smoke]].<ref name="pmid19125149">{{Cite journal|author=Florescu A, Ferrence R , Einarson T, Selby P, Soldin O, Koren G |title=Methods for quantification of exposure to cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke: focus on developmental toxicology | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=14–30 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19125149 |doi=10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181957a3b |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0163-4356&volume=31&issue=1&spage=14}}</ref> People who smoke [[menthol]] cigarettes may retain cotinine in the blood for a longer period because menthol can compete with [[drug metabolism|enzymatic metabolism]] of cotinine.<ref name=femalesmokers>{{Cite web| last = Ham | first = Becky | title = Signs of smoking linger longer in menthol smokers | work = Center for the Advancement of Health | publisher = Science Blog | year = 2002 | month = December | url = http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/G/20021531.html | accessdate = 17 March 2010 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5oHyEmtc2 | archivedate = 17 March 2010}}</ref> [[Genetic code|Genetic encoding]] of [[liver]] [[enzyme]]s may also play a role, as people of [[African]] descent routinely register higher blood cotinine levels than [[White American|Caucasian]]s.<ref name=race>{{Cite news| last = News | first = BBC | title = 'Race role' in tobacco smoke risk | publisher = BBC NEWS | date = 2007-03-17 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/6441267.stm | accessdate = 2007-03-18 }}</ref> Several variable factors (such as menthol cigarette preference and puff size) suggest that the explanation for this difference may be more complex than [[gender]] or [[human races|race]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Cotinine levels <10 ng/mL are considered to be consistent with no active smoking. Values of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL are associated with light smoking or moderate passive exposure, and levels above 300 ng/mL are seen in heavy smokers - more than 20 cigarettes a day. In urine, values between 11 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 500 ng/mL or more. Cotinine assays provide an objective quantitative measure that is more reliable than smoking histories or counting the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Cotinine also permits the measurement of exposure to second-hand smoke (passive smoking).

Drug tests can detect cotinine in the [[blood]], [[urine]], or [[saliva]].

However, some smoking cessation programs contain Nicotine which will result in a positive for Cotinine presence.  Therefore, the presence of Cotinine is not a conclusive indication of tobacco use.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hewitt|first=Doug|title=Reasons for False Positives for Nicotine on a Blood Test|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/26557-reasons-false-positives-nicotine-blood/|publisher=LiveStrong.com|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>
