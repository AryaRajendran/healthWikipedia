==History==

===Early years===
IBT was founded in 1953 by Dr. Joseph C.

Described by his colleagues as a "man of high scientific standards who also knew how to make a dollar", Calandra was an effective entrepreneur; his laboratory was contracted by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to evaluate [[Food irradiation|irradiationally]] [[food preservation|preserved food]] within its first year of operation.<ref name='Schneider 1983-05-11 (a)'>{{cite news | first = Keith | last = Schneider | title = The rise and fall of IBT | date = 1983-05-11 | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/InTheseTimes-1983may11-00003 | work = In These Times | pages = 3 | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}</ref><ref name='SP 1986'>{{cite journal | title = Whose Studies Should You Believe? | journal = Science for the People | date = March/April 1986 | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 15 | url = http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/SftP/MagazineArchive/SftPv18n2s.pdf | accessdate = 2012-07-19}}</ref>

By 1960, IBT reported that its professional staff included 12 biologists, five chemists, a mathematician, four physicians and a veterinarian, and that it employed 16 technicians. Calandra was president and director and John H. Kay was the associate director. At that time, it listed its research areas as "industrial toxicology, food, drugs, cosmetics, pharmacology, radioisotopes, medical, dental, and veterinary products".<ref name='Gribbin 1960'/>

By the early 1960s, IBT had attained a significant reputation for producing quality work at a reasonable price.<ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/><ref name='Broad 1983-05-22'>{{cite news | first = William J. | last = Broad | title = Who Tests the Product-Testing Labs? | date = 1983-05-22 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/weekinreview/who-tests-the-product-testing-labs.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-07-11}}</ref> 
As of mid-decade, it had annual revenue estimated at nearly $2 million US.<ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/>

===1971–1976: Eminence===
In March 1971, IBT hired Dr. Paul L.

Irregularities in IBT's data were discovered in April 1976 by Adrian Gross, an investigator at the [[Food and Drug Administration]], whose aide retrieved one of the laboratory's [[naproxen]] studies that had been conducted for [[Syntex]], a pharmaceutical company recently outed by a [[whistleblower]].<ref name='Marshall 1983-06-10'/><ref name='NYT 1983-05-16'> Laboratory Accused of Fudging[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-laboratory-official-accused-of-fudging.html?scp=216&sq=Deodorant&st=nyt NY Times]</ref><ref name='Merrell 1981'>{{cite journal | title = The Industrial Bio-Test Caper | journal = NCAP News | date = Winter 1981 | first = Paul | last = Merrell | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 2–4 | url = http://www.pesticide.org/get-the-facts/ncap-publications-and-reports/journal-of-pesticide-reform/jpr-vol.2-3-winter-1981.pdf | accessdate = 2012-08-05}}</ref><ref name='Poisoned Research'/> Gross nonetheless continued to read IBT's study, which would ineluctably strike him as being unrealistic and pique his interest.<ref name='Merrell 1981'/> The FDA proceeded to probe IBT, and Gross personally inspected its facilities on April 11 and July 12, 1976.<ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/><ref name='CEN 1977-07-11'>{{cite journal | title = Lab admits to defects in toxicity studies | journal = Chemical & Engineering News | date = 1977-07-11 | volume = 55 | issue = 28 | pages = 7  | doi=10.1021/cen-v055n028.p007}}</ref><ref name='7th Cir. 1983-05-03'>{{cite court | litigants = United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

==Aftermath==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) announced on July 11, 1983 that 34 pesticides would be pulled from the market unless manufacturers provided additional safety data within 90 days, although an indefinite exception was made for those who committed to do so at a later time.<ref name='Shabecoff 1983-07-12'>{{cite news | first = Philip | last = Shabecoff | title = E.P.A.

The Law Reform Commission of Canada noted in a 1987 report that [[Agriculture in Canada|Canadian agriculture]]'s increasing dependence on pesticides had led to inaction against many of those approved on the basis of IBT's research data.<ref name='HEF 1987-12-31'>{{cite journal | title = Ottawa Accepts Invalid Pesticide Data, Law Commission Says | journal = HEF Canada Quarterly | publisher = Winnipeg Free Press, Human Ecology Foundation | date=1987-10-29 | publication-date = 1987-12-31 | coauthors =  | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 34–35 | url = http://ages.ca/sites/default/files/quarterlydec1987ocr.pdf | accessdate = 2012-07-19 | quote=Many pesticides registered as a result of invalid IBT data are still used in Canada, the study says, because the federal government refused to take them off the market until retesting could be done.

''[[The Ecologist]]'' claimed in a 2007 article that IBT had provided [[expert witness|expert testimony]] against Douglas Gowan during a court case in which [[Monsanto]] allegedly sought to [[Defamation|discredit]] and [[Censorship|silence]] him over the wanton disposal of PCBs and other [[toxic waste]] at [[Brofiscin Quarry, Groes Faen]].<ref name='Hughes 2007-10-11'>{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Hughes | coauthors = Pat Thomas | title = Burying The Truth, the original Ecologist investigation into Monsanto and Brofiscin Quarry | date = 2007-10-11 | url = http://www.theecologist.org/The_Brofiscin_Monsanto_Files/777777/burying_the_truth.html | work = The Ecologist | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}</ref>

In April, 1980 the Regina Leader-Post obtained and published a Canadian government list of more than 97 chemicals tested by IBT for which studies were considered "suspect".
