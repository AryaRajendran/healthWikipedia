The '''varicella vaccine''' is a [[live vaccine|live (attenuated) virus]] administered to protect against the viral disease commonly known as [[chickenpox]] caused by the [[varicella zoster virus]] (VZV). The varicella vaccine is marketed as '''Varivax''' in the U.S. by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] and globally as '''Varilrix''' by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. Another vaccine that is known as '''[[Zostavax]]''' is simply a larger-than-normal dose of Varivax, and is used to reduce the risk of shingles (also called [[herpes zoster]]) and [[postherpetic neuralgia]] that are caused by the same virus.

==Dangers of chickenpox==
Prior to the introduction of vaccine in 1995 in the USA (released in 1988 in Japan & Korea), there were around 4,000,000 cases per year in the US, mostly children, with typically 10,500–13,000 hospital admissions (range, 8,000–18,000), and 100–150 deaths each year.<ref name="CDC">{{cite book |author=Lopez, Adriana; Schmid, Scott; Bialek, Stephanie |chapter=Chapter 17: Varicella |chapterurl=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt17-varicella.html |editor=Roush, Sandra W.; McIntyre, Lynne; Baldy, Linda M. |title=Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |location=Atlanta GA |year=2011 |edition=5th |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/index.html}}</ref><ref name="WHO-Varicella vaccine">{{cite web | author=The Vaccines and other Biologicals department | publisher=WHO | title=Varicella vaccine | url=http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/varicella.shtml | date=May 2003 | accessdate=2006-08-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060813125255/http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/varicella.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-08-13}} — which includes:<br>{{cite journal | title=Varicella vaccines: WHO position paper | journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record | year=1998 | volume=73 | pages=241–248 | url=http://www.who.int/wer/pdf/1998/wer7332.pdf | format=PDF | pmid=9715106 | issue=32}}</ref> Though mostly children caught it, the majority of deaths (by as much as 80%) were among adults.

==Vaccination worldwide==
Japan was among the first countries to vaccinate for chickenpox. Routine vaccination against varicella zoster virus is also performed in the [[United States]], and the incidence of chickenpox has been dramatically reduced there (from 4 million cases per year in the pre-vaccine era to approximately 400,000 cases per year as of 2005). In [[Europe]] most countries do not currently vaccinate against varicella, though the vaccine is gaining wider acceptance. Australia, Canada, and other countries have now adopted recommendations for routine immunization of children and susceptible adults against chickenpox.

Other countries, such as [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], have targeted recommendations for the vaccine, e.g., for susceptible health care workers at risk of varicella exposure. In the UK, varicella antibodies are measured as part of the routine of prenatal care, and by 2005 all [[National Health Service]] personnel had determined their immunity and been immunized if they were non-immune and have direct patient contact. Population-based immunization against varicella is not otherwise practiced in the UK. It is feared that there would be a greater number of cases of shingles in adults, until the vaccination was given to the entire population—because adults who have had chickenpox as a child are less likely to have shingles in later life if they have been exposed occasionally to the chickenpox virus (for example by their children). This is because the exposure acts as a booster vaccine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/chickenpox/gen_info.htm |title=UK Health Protection Agency (''Prevention'' section) |publisher=Hpa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-08}}</ref>

The long-term duration of protection from varicella vaccine is unknown, but there are now persons vaccinated more than thirty years ago with no evidence of waning immunity, while others have become vulnerable in as few as six years. Assessments of duration of immunity are complicated in an environment where natural disease is still common, which typically leads to an overestimation of effectiveness, and we are only now entering an era in the U.S. where the long-term efficacy of varicella vaccine can be accurately gauged.<!--

A mean of 2,350 reports per year are attributed to varicella vaccine based on 20,004 cases reported to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS) database from May, 1995 through December, 2003. Minor events are known to be under-reported to VAERS.

==Administration==
This vaccine is a shot given subcutaneously (under the skin). It is recommended for all children under 13 and for everyone 13 or older who has never had chickenpox.

Two doses are always recommended. In the first case a first dose is administered at 12 to 15 months and a second dose at age 4–6 years. For people older than 13 the two doses are administered 4 to 8 weeks apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaccineinformation.org/varicel/qandavax.asp|title=Who should get this vaccine?|date=|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

The varicella vaccine is not recommended for seriously ill people, [[pregnant women]], people who have experienced a serious allergic reaction to the varicella vaccine in the past, people who are allergic to [[gelatin]], people allergic to [[neomycin]], people suffering from an immune system disease, such as [[HIV]], people receiving high doses of [[steroids]], people receiving treatment for [[cancer]] with [[x-rays]], [[drugs]] or [[chemotherapy]], as well as people who have received [[blood products]] or [[transfusions]] during the past 5 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/vaccines/193.html|title=Who should not receive the varicella vaccine?|date=|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Serious side effects are very rare. However, in rare occasions, some severe reactions have been reported such as [[seizure]]s, [[pneumonia]], and [[anaphylaxis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007065.htm|title=Risks and Side Effects|date=|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

The possible mild side effects include redness, [[stiffness]], and [[soreness]] at the injection site, as well as [[fever]]. A few people may develop a mild [[rash]] which usually appears around the shot's area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaccineinformation.org/varicel/qandavax.asp|title=What side effects have been reported with this vaccine?|date=|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

There is a short term risk of developing [[herpes zoster]] (shingles) following vaccination. However, this risk is less than the risk due to a natural infection resulting in chickenpox. Most of the cases reported have been mild and have not been associated with serious complications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaccineinformation.org/varicel/qandavax.asp|title=Vaccine Information for the public and health professionals|date=|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

==Effectiveness==
According to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], clinical trials have demonstrated that varicella vaccine is 70% to 90% effective for preventing varicella and more than 95% effective for preventing severe varicella.<ref name=Pediatrics00>{{cite journal |author= |title=American Academy of Pediatrics. Committee on Infectious Diseases. Varicella vaccine update |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=136–41 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10617719 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/105/1/136.full.pdf }}</ref>

Furthermore, follow-up evaluations took place in the United States of children immunized that revealed protection for at least 11 years. Also, studies were conducted in [[Japan]] which indicated protection for at least 20 years.<ref name=Pediatrics00/>

People who do not develop enough protection when they get the vaccine may develop a mild case of the disease when in close contact with a person with chickenpox. In these cases, people show very little sign of illness. This has been the case of children who get the vaccine in their [[early childhood]] and later have contact with children with chickenpox. Some of these children may develop a mild chickenpox also known as breakthrough disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoptechno.com/chickenpox-vac.htm |title=Varicella Vaccine (Chickenpox)|date=|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
Mortality due to primary varicella has declined significantly in countries which make wide use of the varicella vaccine.<!--
  --><ref name="Seward2002"/><!--
  --><ref name="Wise2000"/>
Zoster (shingles) most often occurs in the elderly. Multiple studies have not observed any effect on zoster incidence. This may be because infants and children immunized in varicella vaccination programs have not yet reached the age where zoster typically occurs. It is likewise too early to observe the effect on [[postherpetic neuralgia]] (PHN).

It has been claimed that adult shingles may increase after introduction of varicella vaccine.<!--

Additional controversy has arisen because cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue were used in its development, and thus violates the ethics and beliefs of people who oppose the use of aborted fetal tissue in medical research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/gen/humancell.htm |title=NIP: Vacsafe/Concerns/Gen/Human Cell Cultures in Manufacturing Vaccines |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070212172520/http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/gen/humancell.htm |archivedate = 2007-02-12}}</ref>

===Duration of immunity===
Some vaccinated children have been found to lose their protective antibody in as little as five to eight years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chaves SS, Gargiullo P, Zhang JX, ''et al.'' |title=Loss of vaccine-induced immunity to varicella over time |journal=N.

Med. |volume=356 |issue=11 |pages=1121–9 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17360990 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa064040 }}</ref> However, according to the [[World Health Organization]]: "After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella." However, since only one out of five Japanese children were vaccinated, the annual exposure of these vaccinees to children with natural chickenpox boosted the vaccinees' immune system. In the United States, where universal varicella vaccination has been practiced, the majority of children no longer receive exogenous (outside) boosting, thus, their cell-mediated immunity to VZV (varicella zoster virus) wanes—necessitating booster chickenpox vaccinations.<!--
  --><ref name="WHO-Varicella vaccine"/>
Some persons exposed to the virus after vaccine can experience milder cases of chicken pox (and usually then harbor both the attenuated vaccine or oka strain as well as the wild type or natural chickenpox strain which are both subject to reactivation as shingles).<!--
  --><ref name="CDCP-diseaseFAQs">{{cite web | work=Varicella Disease (Chickenpox) | title=General questions about the disease | url=http://www.cdc.gov/nip/diseases/varicella/faqs-gen-disease.htm | date=December 20, 2001 | publisher=CDCP | accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref>

Catching "wild" chickenpox as a child has been thought to commonly result in lifelong immunity. Indeed, parents have deliberately ensured this in the past with "[[pox parties]]". Historically, exposure of adults to contagious children has boosted their immunity, reducing the risk of shingles.<ref name="HerpesDoctor-506-Jack"/>

<!-- immunocompromise is a different topic really -->
The CDC and corresponding national organisations are carefully observing the failure rate which may be high compared with other modern vaccines — large outbreaks of chickenpox having occurred at schools which required their children to be vaccinated.<!--

===Immunocompromise===
The mortality rate in immunocompromised patients with disseminated herpes zoster is 5–15%, with most deaths from [[pneumonia]]. Vaccines are less effective among these high-risk patients, as well as being more dangerous because they contain attenuated live virus (see last footnote). In a study performed on children with an [[Immunodeficiency|impaired immune system]], 30% had lost the antibody after five years, and 8% had already caught wild chickenpox in that five-year period.<!--
