'''Inborn errors of metabolism''' comprise a large class of [[genetic disease]]s involving disorders of [[metabolism]]. The majority are due to defects of single [[gene]]s that code for [[enzyme]]s that facilitate conversion of various substances ([[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s) into others ([[Product (chemistry)|product]]s). In most of the disorders, problems arise due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function, or to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds. Inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to as '''congenital metabolic diseases''' or '''inherited metabolic diseases'''.

The term ''inborn error of metabolism'' was coined by a British physician, [[Archibald Garrod]] (1857â€“1936), in the early 20th century (1908). He is known for work that prefigured the [["one gene-one enzyme" hypothesis]], based on his studies on the nature and inheritance of [[alkaptonuria]]. His seminal text, ''[http://www.esp.org/books/garrod/inborn-errors/facsimile/ Inborn Errors of Metabolism]'' was published in 1923.

==Major categories of inherited metabolic diseases==
Traditionally the inherited metabolic diseases were categorized as disorders of [[carbohydrate]] metabolism, [[amino acid]] metabolism, [[organic acid]] metabolism, or [[lysosomal storage disease]]s. In recent decades, hundreds of new inherited disorders of metabolism have been discovered and the categories have proliferated. Following are some of the major classes of congenital metabolic diseases, with prominent examples of each class. Many others do not fall into these categories. [[ICD|ICD-10]] codes are provided where available.

*[[Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism|Disorders of carbohydrate metabolism]]
**E.g., [[glycogen storage disease]]
*Disorders of [[List of amino acid metabolism disorders|amino acid]] metabolism
**E.g., [[phenylketonuria]], [[maple syrup urine disease]], [[glutaric acidemia type 1]]
*[[Urea Cycle Disorder]] or Urea Cycle Defects
**E.g., [[Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency]]
*Disorders of [[organic acid]] metabolism ([[organic aciduria]]s)
**E.g., [[alcaptonuria]]
*Disorders of [[List of fatty acid metabolism disorders|fatty acid oxidation]] and [[mitochondrial]] metabolism
**E.g., [[Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (often shortened to MCADD.)
*Disorders of [[porphyrin]] metabolism
**E.g., [[acute intermittent porphyria]]
*Disorders of [[purine]] or [[pyrimidine]] metabolism
**E.g., [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]]
*[[Inborn errors of steroid metabolism|Disorders of steroid metabolism]]
**E.g., [[lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]
*Disorders of [[mitochondrial]] function
**E.g., [[Kearns-Sayre syndrome]]
*Disorders of [[peroxisomal]] function
**E.g., [[Zellweger syndrome]]
*[[Lysosomal storage disorder]]s
**E.g., [[Gaucher's disease]]
**E.g., [[Niemann Pick disease]]

==Incidence==
In a study in [[British Columbia]], the overall incidence of the inborn errors of metabolism were estimated to be 70 per 100,000 live births or 1 in 1,400 births,<ref name=BC>{{cite journal |author=Applegarth DA, Toone JR, Lowry RB |title=Incidence of inborn errors of metabolism in British Columbia, 1969-1996 |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=e10 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10617747 |doi= 10.1542/peds.105.1.e10|url=}}</ref> overall representing more than approximately 15% of [[single gene disorders]] in the population.<ref name=BC/>

==Manifestations and presentations==
Because of the enormous number of these diseases and wide range of systems affected, nearly every "presenting complaint" to a doctor may have a congenital metabolic disease as a possible cause, especially in childhood. The following are examples of potential manifestations affecting each of the major organ systems: many manifestations may develop

*[[Growth failure]], [[failure to thrive]], weight loss
*[[intersex|Ambiguous genitalia]], [[delayed puberty]], [[precocious puberty]]
*[[Developmental delay]], [[seizure]]s, [[dementia]], [[encephalopathy]], [[stroke]]
*[[Deafness]], [[blindness]], [[pain agnosia]]
*Skin [[rash]], abnormal [[pigmentation]], lack of pigmentation, [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]], lumps and bumps
*Dental abnormalities
*[[Immunodeficiency]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[anemia]], enlarged [[spleen]], enlarged [[lymph node]]s
*Many forms of [[cancer]]
*Recurrent [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]]
*Excessive [[urination]], [[renal failure]], [[dehydration]], [[edema]]
*[[Hypotension]], [[heart failure]], enlarged heart, [[hypertension]], [[myocardial infarction]]
*[[Hepatomegaly]], [[jaundice]], [[liver failure]]
*Unusual facial features, [[congenital malformation]]s
*Excessive breathing ([[hyperventilation]]), [[respiratory failure]]
*Abnormal behavior, [[clinical depression|depression]], [[psychosis]]
*Joint pain, [[muscle]] weakness, cramps
*[[Hypothyroidism]], [[adrenal insufficiency]], [[hypogonadism]], [[diabetes mellitus]]

==Diagnostic techniques==
Dozens of congenital metabolic diseases are now detectable by [[newborn screening]] tests, especially the expanded testing using mass spectrometry. This is an increasingly common way for the diagnosis to be made and sometimes results in earlier treatment and a better outcome. There is a revolutionary GC/MS based technology with an integrated analytics system, which has now made it possible to test a newborn for over 100 genetic metabolic disorders.

Because of the multiplicity of conditions, many different [[diagnostic test]]s are used for screening. An abnormal result is often followed by a subsequent "definitive test" to confirm the suspected diagnosis. 

Common screening tests used in the last sixty years:
*[[Ferric chloride test]] (turned colors in reaction to various abnormal metabolites in urine)
*[[Ninhydrin]] [[paper chromatography]] (detected abnormal [[amino acid]] patterns)
*[[Guthrie test|Guthrie bacterial inhibition assay]] (detected a few amino acids in excessive amounts in blood) The dried blood spot can be used for multianalyte testing using Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). This given an indication for a disorder. The same has to be further confirmed by enzyme assays, GC/MS or DNA Testing.
*Quantitative measurement of [[amino acids]] in [[Blood plasma|plasma]] and [[urine]]
*Urine [[organic acid]] analysis by [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]]
*Plasma [[acylcarnitines]] analysis by [[mass spectrometry]]
*Urine [[purines]] and [[pyrimidines]] analysis by [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]]

Specific diagnostic tests (or focused screening for a small set of disorders):
*Tissue [[biopsy]] or [[necropsy]]: [[liver]], [[muscle]], [[brain]], [[bone marrow]]
*Skin biopsy and fibroblast cultivation for specific enzyme testing
*Specific [[DNA testing]]

==Treatment==
In the middle of the 20th century the principal treatment for some of the [[amino acid disorder]]s was restriction of dietary protein and all other care was simply management of complications. In the past twenty years, enzyme replacement, gene transfer, and organ transplantation have become available and beneficial for many previously untreatable disorders. Some of the more common or promising therapies are listed:

*Dietary restriction
**E.g., reduction of dietary protein remains a mainstay of treatment for [[phenylketonuria]] and other [[amino acid disorder]]s
*Dietary supplementation or replacement
**E.g., oral ingestion of cornstarch several times a day helps prevent people with [[glycogen storage disease]]s from becoming seriously [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]].
*Vitamins
**E.g., [[thiamine]] supplementation benefits several types of disorders that cause [[lactic acidosis]].
*Intermediary metabolites, compounds, or drugs that facilitate or retard specific metabolic pathways
*Dialysis
*Enzyme replacement E.g. Acid-alpha glucosidase for Pompe disease
*Gene transfer
*Bone marrow or organ transplantation
*Treatment of symptoms and complications
*Prenatal diagnosis and avoidance of pregnancy or abortion of an affected fetus
