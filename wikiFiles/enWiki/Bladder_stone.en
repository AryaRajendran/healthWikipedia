A '''bladder stone''' (also called a '''vesical calculus''' or '''cystolith''') is a [[Calculus (medicine)|stone]] found in the [[urinary bladder]]. The term ''cystolithiasis'' refers to the presence of stones in the bladder.<ref name=McNutt1893>{{cite book|last1=McNutt|first1=WF|title=Diseases of the kidneys and bladder: a text-book for students of medicine|volume=IV: Diseases of the Bladder|chapter=Chapter VII: Vesical Calculi (Cysto-lithiasis)|pages=185–6|publisher=J.B.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bladder stones are small particles that can form in the bladder. In most cases bladder stones develop when the urine becomes very concentrated or when one is dehydrated. This allows for the minerals like calcium or magnesium to crystallize and form stones. Bladder stones vary in number size and consistency. In some cases bladder stones do not cause any symptoms of signs and are discovered as an incidental finding on a plain [[Projectional radiography|radiograph]]. However, when symptoms do occur these may include severe lower abdominal and back pain, difficult urination, frequent urination at night, fever, painful urination and [[hematuria|blood in the urine]]. The majority of individuals who are symptomatic will complain of pain which comes in waves. The pain may also be associated with nausea, vomiting and chills.<ref name="Bladder Stones General Overview">[http://www.bladder-stones.com/ Bladder Stones General Overview], Retrieved on 2010-01-19.</ref>

Bladder stones vary in their size, shape and texture- some are small, hard and smooth whereas others are huge, spiked and very soft. One can have one or multiple stones. Bladder stones are somewhat more common in men who have prostate enlargement. The large [[prostate]] presses on the urethra and makes it difficult to pass urine. Over time stagnant urine collects in the bladder and minerals like calcium start to precipitate. Other individuals who develop bladder stones include those who have had [[spinal cord injury]], paralysis or some type of nerve damage. When nerves to the back are damaged, the bladder cannot empty and stagnant urine results.<ref name="Bladder Stones Prevention">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bladder-stones/DS00904/DSECTION=prevention Bladder Stones Prevention], Retrieved on 2010-01-19.</ref>

==Causes==
Bladder stones may occur whenever the kidneys, bladder, or ureters become [[inflammation|inflamed]]. The use of [[Urinary catheterization|urinary catheters]] may cause a bladder stone. Individuals who are paralyzed or are unable to adequately pass urine may require the use of small plastic tubes ([[catheter]]s) placed into the bladder. The use of these tubes may lead to an [[infection]], which irritates the bladder, resulting in stone formation. Finally, a kidney stone may travel down the ureter into the bladder and become a bladder stone. There is some evidence indicating that chronic irritation of the bladder by retained stones may increase the chance of [[bladder cancer]]. Urinary [[schistosomiasis]], a disease caused by the [[digenea]]n [[Trematoda|trematode]] ''[[Schistosoma haematobium]]'', has been implicated in the development of vesical calculi.<ref name=Ward1945>{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=RO|title=Some Surgical Aspects of Urinary Bilharziasis|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=27–38|year=1945|issn=0035-9157|pmid=20917589|pmc=2181785}}</ref><ref name=Lukacs1989>{{cite journal|last=Lukács|first=T|coauthors=Frang D, El-Seaghy AA, Pajor L|title=Multiple urolithiasis in bilharziasis patients|journal=International Urology and Nephrology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=269–73|year=1989|issn=|pmc=|pmid=2807777|doi=10.1007/BF02559736}}</ref> However, evidence accumulated thus far has not supported this hypothesis.<ref name=Ibrahim1978>{{cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=A|title=The relationship between urinary bilharziasis and urolithiasis in the Sudan|journal=British Journal of Urology|volume=50|issue=5|pages=294–7|year=1978|issn=0007-1331|pmid=753482|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.1978.tb03634.x}}</ref><ref name=Kambal1981>{{cite journal|last=Kambal|first=A|title=The Relation of Urinary Bilharziasis to Vesical Stones in Children|journal=British Journal of Urology|volume=53|issue=4|pages=315|year=1981|issn=0007-1331|pmid=7260543|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.1981.tb03185.x}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of bladder stone includes [[urinalysis]], [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]], [[medical radiography|x rays]] or [[cystoscopy]] (inserting a small thin camera into the urethra and viewing the bladder). The [[intravenous pyelogram]] can also be used to assess the presence of kidney stones. This test involves injecting a [[radiocontrast]] agent which is passed into the urinary system. X-ray images are then obtained every few minutes to determine if there is any obstruction to the contrast as it is excreted into the bladder. Today, intravenous pyelogram has been replaced at many health centers by [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]]. CT scans are more sensitive and can identify very small stones not seen by other tests.<ref name="Bladder Stones: eMedicine Urology">[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/440657-overview Bladder Stones: eMedicine Urology], Retrieved on 2010-01-19.</ref>

==Prevention==
The best way to prevent bladder stones is to drink plenty of liquids. Juices containing citrates are thought to reduce the risk of stone formation. A study published in the ''Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology'' indicate orange juice is more effective at preventing stone formation than other citrus juices.<ref name="Orange Juice Fights Kidney Stones">[http://www.webmd.com/kidney-stones/news/20060907/orange-juice-fights-kidney-stones], Retrieved 2011-04-26.</ref> Men who have difficulty with urination due to [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|prostatic hypertrophy]] should seek treatment.<ref name="Bladder Stones: Prevention">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bladder-stones/DS00904/DSECTION=prevention Bladder Stones: Prevention], Retrieved on 2010-01-19.</ref>

==Management==
Increasing fluid intake can facilitate the passage of small bladder stones. However, larger stones may require other methods of treatment.<ref name=BladderStones>[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/bladder-stones/overview.html Bladder Stones: NY Times Health Information], Retrieved on 2010-01-19.</ref> Fragmentation of bladder stones can be achieved by use of a [[Cystoscopy|cystoscope]] which is inserted into the bladder. The [[urology|urologist]] visualizes the stone and uses [[ultrasound|ultrasonic energy]] or [[laser lithotripsy]] to cause fragmentation of the stones into small pieces which are then flushed out of the bladder. This procedure requires [[anesthesia]] and may require admission to a hospital. Complications of this treatment include infection and damage to the bladder.<ref name="Bladder Stones Overview: University of Maryland Medical Center">[http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/001275.htm Bladder Stones Overview: University of Maryland Medical Center], Retrieved on 2010-01-19.</ref> Some stones are too large even for cystoscopic treatment and may require open cystotomy, in which an incision is made in the bladder and the stones are removed manually.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

==History==
[[File:Carel van Savoyen - Jan de Doot.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Jan de Doot]], by [[Carel van Savoyen]], holding the bladder stone he removed from himself according to a 1652 account in the book ''[[Observationes Medicae (Tulp)|Observationes Medicae]]'' by [[Nicolaes Tulp]]]]

''Lithoclastic cystotomy'' is attributed to [[Ammonius Lithotomos]] (stone-cutter) of Alexandria, Egypt. The term "[[lithotomy]]" is derived from the same words (λιθοτομία (lithotomia) - stone-cutting). [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] wrote that Lithotomos developed instruments to break up and extract bladder stones.<ref name=Celsus1831>{{cite book|last=Celsus|first=Aulus Cornelius|title=A translation of the eight books of Aul.
