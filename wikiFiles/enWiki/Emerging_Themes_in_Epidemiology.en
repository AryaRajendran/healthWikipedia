'''''Emerging Themes in Epidemiology''''' is an online [[open access]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]]. It is managed by current [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral students]] and recent PhD graduates in the United Kingdom and Canada. The journal is based at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] and is published by [[BioMed Central]].

== Principles ==
The journal has three guiding principles: 

# That more fundamental discussion is needed of the theoretical frameworks that underpin the field of epidemiology, as well as the methodological and practical challenges of conducting epidemiological research
# That scientific knowledge, a public good that results mainly from publicly funded research, should be made freely available through Open Access
# That doctorate students should have an opportunity to contribute more directly to the scientific discourse by influencing what is published, while gaining experience in editing and publishing an academic journal

== Scope ==
The journal publishes articles related to any aspect of [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] research and practice, focusing on novel theoretical frameworks, methodological developments, causal inference, and [[epistemology]]. It does not generally consider reports of primary research, but publishes discursive pieces that comment critically on epidemiologic research and practice.

It also publishes special collections of articles with the aim of bringing attention to emerging themes in public health. The journal was launched with a series of articles on the role of epidemiology in conflict settings, in collaboration with authors from a number of academic and public health institutions, and [[humanitarian organization]]s. Since then, the journal has published articles focusing on migration and [[health]] and methods for health surveys in hard-to-reach populations.

== Editorial board ==
The journal’s [[editor-in-chief]] is Peter Smith (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). The journal’s [[editorial board]] is composed of current and former doctorate students at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, [[Imperial College London]], the [[Health Protection Agency]] Centre for Infections, the [[Institute of Child Health]] (London); the Oxford Medical Research Programme (Thailand); and the [[Université de Montréal]] (Canada).
