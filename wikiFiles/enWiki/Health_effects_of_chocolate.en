The '''health effects of chocolate''' refer to the possible beneficial or detrimental physiological effects of eating [[chocolate]] mainly for [[Epicureanism|pleasure]].  For example, [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]] and [[dark chocolate]] may support [[cardiovascular]] health.<ref name="dark">{{cite web|first=Daniel J.|last=DeNoon|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20030827/dark-chocolate-is-healthy-chocolate|title=Dark Chocolate Is Healthy Chocolate|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref> Other effects under preliminary research include reduced risks of [[cancer]], [[coughing]] and  [[heart disease]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Victoria |last=Haley | url=http://www.medilink.co.uk/news/chocolate_may_reduce_risk_of_heart_disease_09-06-17.aspx |title=Chocolate may reduce risk of heart disease|publisher=[[NHS Trust]]|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> One interpretation on the potential health effects of dietary chocolate is it may lower [[blood pressure]], improve [[vascular]] function and [[energy metabolism]], and reduce [[platelet aggregation]] and adhesion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sudano I, Flammer AJ, Roas S, Enseleit F, Ruschitzka F, Corti R, Noll G |year=2012 |title=Cocoa, blood pressure, and vascular function |journal=Curr Hypertens Rep |volume=14 |issue= 4|pages=279–84 |publisher= |doi= |pmid=22684995 |url= |accessdate=4 July 2012 }}</ref>

Unconstrained consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity, increases the risk of [[obesity]]. Raw chocolate is high in [[cocoa butter]], a fat removed during chocolate refining, then added back in varying proportions during  manufacturing. Manufacturers may add other fats, [[sugar]]s, and [[milk]] as well, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate. One study indicated that melting chocolate in one's mouth produced an increase in brain activity and [[heart rate]] that was more intense than that associated with [[kissing]], lasting four times as long after the activity had ended.<ref name="BBCchocokiss">{{cite news

==Potential effects in the body==
=== Headache ===
Research on rats has determined that increased chocolate intake enhances the expression of [[MAP kinase phosphatase|MKP]] in the [[trigeminal ganglion]], lowering the level of [[calcitonin gene-related peptide|CGRP]] and other inflammatory chemicals, suppressing the symptoms of [[migraine]]s.<ref>Cady, Ryan and Durham, Paul "Cocoa-enriched diets enhance expression of phosphatases and decrease expression of inflammatory molecules in trigeminal ganglion neurons" ''[[Brain Research]]'' 1/29/2010</ref>

=== Cardiovascular system ===
Limited research indicates that cocoa or dark chocolate may produce certain effects on human health. In test tubes, cocoa has [[antioxidant]] activity, an effect not proved in the body. Chocolate phenols may affect arteries and inhibit lipid oxidation, but this research has not been adequately confirmed.<ref name="yale">{{cite web | url=http://www.ynhh.org/online/nutrition/advisor/chocolate.html | title=Chocolate: Food of the Gods | publisher=[[Yale - New Haven Hospital]] | accessdate=4 September 2010}}</ref>

In a Swiss study a group of 20 smokers were given 40 grams of chocolate. Two hours after consuming the chocolate, the echo-graph showed that black chocolate, with a cocoa percent of at least 74%, significantly improved the blood flow. Additionally, ulterior tests showed that the risk of encountering blood accidents and blockages has been decreased to half of the initial risk.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bettertopic.com/2012/08/19/doctors-recommend-chocolate/| title=Doctor’s Recommend Chocolate| publisher=BetterTopic.com| accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>

===Addiction/craving===
There is some evidence that chocolate may be addictive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-you-become-addicted-to-chocolate-201302145903|title=Can you become addicted to chocolate?|last=Miller|first=Michael Craig|date=February 14, 2013|work=Harvard Health Blog|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/chocoholic-now-science-part-2344453|title=Chocoholic?

=== Aphrodisiac ===
Romantic lore commonly identifies chocolate as an [[aphrodisiac]]. The reputed aphrodisiac qualities of chocolate are most often associated with the simple sensual pleasure of its consumption. Although there is no proof that chocolate is indeed an aphrodisiac {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, a gift of chocolate is a familiar courtship ritual. Research looking at the psychoactivity of chocolate reveals that [[Xanthine|methylxanthine]], an active biological substance found in chocolate, competes with [[adenosine]], a presynaptic inhibitor modulator, and blocks its receptor.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0165-0173(92)90012-B | author = Nehlig, A., Daval, J., and Debry, G. | title = Caffeine and the central nervous system: mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic, and pyschostimulant effects | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–170 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1356551 }}</ref> This induced blockage can lead to arousal. The participants' blood pressure decreased, and they showed improvements in insulin sensitivity, meaning they were better able to metabolize glucose.

=== Weight gain ===
A concern that nutritionists have is that excessive consumption of dark chocolate may promote weight gain and obesity which are risk factors for many diseases, including cardiovascular disease. As a consequence, consuming large quantities of dark chocolate in an attempt to protect against cardiovascular disease has been described as 'cutting off one's nose to spite one's face'.<ref>{{cite web | first=Stuart J. | last=Adams | url=http://nutra-smart.net/cocoa.htm | title=A Critical Look at the Effects of Cocoa on Human Health. | publisher=Pabulum, 2004 Issue 61 | accessdate=3 March 2006}}</ref>

=== Acne ===
There is a popular belief that the consumption of chocolate can cause [[acne vulgaris|acne]]. This belief is not supported by scientific studies.<ref>{{cite web |author= Karl S.

Chocolate contains a variety of substances, some of which may have an effect on body chemistry. These include:

* [[Anandamide]]
* [[Arginine]]
* [[Caffeine]], present in smaller amounts<ref name="chocoxanthine"/><ref>''Caffeine Blues: Wake Up to the Hidden Dangers of America's #1 Drug'' by Stephen Snehan Cherniske.{{full|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref>''The Truth About Caffeine'' by Marina Kushner{{full|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref>"Poison with a Capital C", Agatha M Thrash MD, 2000, 61pp, American Vegan Society</ref><ref>''Welcome to the Dance: Caffeine Allergy - A Masked Cerebral Allergy and Progressive Toxic Dementia'', Trafford Publishing, 2005{{full|date=April 2013}}</ref>
* [[Dopamine]]
* [[Xanthine|Methylated xanthines]] (theobromine, caffeine & theophylline)
* [[Monoamine oxidase]]
* [[Oxalic acid]]
* [[Phenethylamine]], an [[endogenous]] [[alkaloid]] sometimes described as a 'love chemical;<ref>{{cite book |author=Liebowitz, Michael R. |title=The chemistry of love |publisher=[[Little, Brown]] |location=Boston |year=1983 |isbn=0-316-52430-1 |doi=}}</ref> it is quickly metabolized by [[monoamine oxidase]]-B and does not reach the [[brain]] in significant amounts

* [[Theophylline]]
* [[Tryptophan]], an essential [[amino acid]] and precursor to [[serotonin]]
* [[Tyramine]], found in processed chocolate (not raw cacao) after [[fermentation_(food) | fermentation]].

Chocolate may be a mild [[stimulant]] to humans mainly due to the presence of [[theobromine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smit HJ, Gaffan EA, Rogers PJ |title=Methylxanthines are the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=176 |issue=3–4 |pages=412–419 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15549276 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-1898-3}}</ref> It is much more potent for horses, and its use in [[horse racing]] is prohibited.

White chocolate contains only trace amounts of the caffeine and theobromine of normal chocolates, because these chemicals are contained in the cocoa solids, not the [[cocoa butter]], from which [[white chocolate]] is made.

=== Other research===
One preliminary study showed that post-exercise consumption of low fat [[chocolate milk]] provided equal or possibly superior [[muscle]] recovery compared to a high-carbohydrate recovery beverage with the same amount of calories.<ref name="medicalnewstoday-muscle-recovery-152240">{{cite web|title=Chocolate Milk's 'Natural' Muscle Recovery Benefits Match Or May Even Surpass A Specially Designed Carbohydrate Sports Drink|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/152240.php}}</ref>

== Lead content ==
Chocolate consumption may have potential to cause mild [[lead poisoning]], as some studies have shown that lead may bind to cocoa shells and contamination may occur during the manufacturing process.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rankin|first=CW|last2=Nriagu |first2=JO |last3=Aggarwal |first3=JK |last4=Arowolo |first4=TA |last5=Adebayo |first5=K |last6=Flegal |first6=AR |title=Lead contamination in cocoa and cocoa products: isotopic evidence of global contamination |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=113 |issue=10 |pages=1344–1348 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16203244 |pmc=1281277 |doi=10.1289/ehp.8009}}</ref> In a [[USDA]] study in 2004, mean lead levels in the samples tested ranged from 0.0010 to 0.0965&nbsp; µg lead per gram of chocolate, but another study by a Swiss research group in 2002 found that some chocolate contained up to 0.769&nbsp; µg per gram, close to the international (voluntary) standard limit for lead in cocoa powder or beans, which is 1&nbsp; µg of lead per gram.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karrie Heneman & Sheri Zidenberg-Cherr |title=Is Lead Toxicity Still a Risk to U.

==Polyphenol content==
[[Chocolate]] contains [[polyphenol]]s, especially [[flavan-3-ol]]s (''catechins'') and [[flavonoid]]s which are under study for their potential effects in the body.

== Potential toxicity in animals ==

{{Main|Theobromine poisoning}}
In sufficient amounts, the theobromine found in chocolate is [[toxic]] to animals such as horses, dogs, parrots, small rodents, and cats because they are unable to [[metabolize|metabolise]] the chemical effectively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smit HJ |year=2011 |title=Theobromine and the pharmacology of cocoa |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol |volume=200 |issue= |pages=201–34 |publisher= |doi= |pmid=20859797 |pmc= |url= |accessdate= 4 July 2012}}</ref> If animals are fed chocolate, the theobromine may remain in the circulation for up to 20&nbsp; hours, possibly causing [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[internal bleeding]], and eventually death. Medical treatment performed by a [[veterinarian]] involves inducing [[vomiting]] within two hours of ingestion and administration of [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[barbiturate]]s for seizures, [[antiarrhythmic agents|antiarrhythmics]] for [[cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmias]], and [[forced diuresis|fluid diuresis]].

A typical {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog will normally experience great intestinal distress after eating less than {{convert|240|g|oz}} of dark chocolate, but will not necessarily experience [[bradycardia]] or [[tachycardia]] unless it eats at least a half a kilogram (1.1&nbsp;lb) of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate has 2 to 5 times more theobromine and thus is more dangerous to dogs. According to the [[Merck Veterinary Manual]], approximately 1.3&nbsp; grams of baker's chocolate per kilogram of a dog's body weight (0.02&nbsp; oz/lb) is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity. For example, a typical {{convert|25|g|oz|adj=on}} baker's chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog. Of course, baking chocolate is rarely consumed directly due to its unpleasant taste, but other dark chocolates' canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure. Given access, dogs frequently consume chocolate at toxic levels because they like the taste of chocolate products and are capable of finding and eating quantities much larger than typical human servings. There are reports that [[mulch]] made from cacao bean shells is dangerous to dogs and livestock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pro_apcc_publicationscocoa|title=Chocolate with Animals|publisher=Animal Poison Control Center|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref><ref>Drolet R, Arendt TD, Stowe CM.
