'''Human skin color''' ranges in variety from the [[dark skin|darkest brown]] to the [[Light skin|lightest pinkish-white]] hues. [[Human skin]] shows higher variation in color than any other single [[mammal]]ian species and is the result of [[natural selection]]. Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of [[ultraviolet radiation]] penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.<ref name=jabl1>{{cite book|last=Muehlenbein|first=Micheal|title=Human Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=192–213}}</ref>

The actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances, although the single most important substance determining human skin color is the pigment [[melanin]]. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called [[melanocyte]]s and it is the main determinant of the skin color of [[Dark skin|darker-skinned]] humans. The skin color of people with [[light skin]] is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the [[dermis]] and by the [[haemoglobin]] circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible, especially in the face, when, as consequence of [[physical exercise]] or the stimulation of the [[nervous system]] (anger, fear), [[arterioles]] dilate.<ref name=Jabl06>{{cite book|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|title=Skin: a Natural History|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}</ref>

Natural skin color can darken as a result of [[Sun tanning|tanning]] due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the [[ultraviolet radiation|ultraviolet]] fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the [[DNA]] of the skin cells.<ref name=pmid20445093>{{cite journal |last1=Jablonski |first1=N.

Areas that highlight higher amounts of UVR reflect darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer towards the equator. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations.<ref name=webb06>{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=A.R.|title=Who, what, where, and when: influences on cutaneous vitamin D synthesis|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|volume=92|pages=17–25}}</ref>

In the same population it has been observed that adult human [[woman|female]]s are considerably lighter in skin pigmentation than [[man|male]]s. Females need more [[calcium]] during [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]]. [[Vitamin D]], which the body synthesizes from sunlight, helps the body absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.<ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal| last=Jablonski| first=N.G. |coauthors=Chaplin| title=The evolution of human skin coloration| journal=Journal of Human Evolution| year=2000| volume=39| pages=57–106| url=http://faculty.washington.edu/charles/562_f2011/Week%201/Jablonski%202004.pdf }}</ref> The social significance of differences in skin color has varied across cultures and over time, as demonstrated with regard to [[social status]] and [[discrimination]].

==Melanin and genes==
{{Main|Melanin}}
Melanin is produced by cells called [[melanocyte]]s in a process called [[melanogenesis]]. Melanin is triggered by an [[enzyme]] called [[tyrosinase]], which creates the color of skin, eyes, and hair shades. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin. The most common form of [[Biological tissue|biological]] melanin is [[eumelanin]], a brown-black [[polymer]] of dihydroxy[[indole]] [[carboxylic acid]]s, and their reduced forms. Most are derived from the amino acid [[tyrosine]]. Eumelanin is found in hair, [[areola]], and skin, and the hair colors grey, black, yellow, and brown. In humans, it is more abundant in people with dark skin. [[Pheomelanin]], a pink to red hue is found in particularly large quantities in [[red hair]],<ref>V.Krishnaraj, M.D, Skin Layers</ref> the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.<ref>http://www.metacyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=COMPOUND&object=CPD-12380</ref> Both the amount and type of melanin produced is controlled by a number of [[gene]]s that operate under [[incomplete dominance]]. One copy of each of the various genes is inherited from each parent. Each gene can come in several [[allele]]s, resulting in the great variety of human skin tones.

Melanin controls the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation from the sun that penetrates the skin by absorption. While UV radiation can assist in the production of vitamin D, excessive exposure to UV can damage health.

==Genetics of skin color variation==
{{See also|Human genetic variation|Race and genetics|Human genetic clustering}}

Genetic studies have discovered a number of genes that affect human skin colour across different populations. These studies suggest a 3-way model for the evolution of human skin colour, with dark skin evolving in early [[hominids]] in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and light skin evolving separately in [[Europe]] and [[East Asia]] after modern humans had expanded [[out of Africa]].<ref name=McEvoy2006>{{cite journal |author=McEvoy Brian et. al. |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |year=2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=176–181 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddl217 |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/suppl_2/R176.full |title=The genetic architecture of normal variation in human pigmentation: an evolutionary perspective and model }}</ref><ref name=Sturm2009>{{cite journal| author=Richard A Sturm |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |year=2009 |volume=18 |pages=9–17 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp003 }}</ref><ref name="Norton2006" /><ref name=Belezal2012>{{cite journal |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/08/25/molbev.mss207.short |title=The timing of pigmentation lightening in Europeans |author=Belezal, Sandra et. al. |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |year=2012 |doi=10.1093/molbev/mss207 }}</ref><ref name=Edwards2010 /><ref name=Loa2007 />

*'''MC1R'''
:The [[melanocortin 1 receptor]] (MC1R) gene is primarily responsible for determining whether pheomelanin and eumelanin is produced in the human body. Research shows at least 10 differences in MC1R between African and chimpanzee samples and that the gene is under strong [[Biological constraints|functional constraint]] in Africa. This is consistent with [[Directional selection|positive selection]] for the high-eumelanin [[phenotype]] seen in Africa and other environments with high UV exposure.<ref name=Rogers2004 /><ref name=Harding2000 />

===Light skin===
For the most part, the evolution of light skin has followed different genetic paths in European and East Asian populations. Two genes however, KITLG and ASIP, have mutations associated with lighter skin that have high frequencies in both European and East Asian populations and have estimated origin dates after humans spread out of Africa but before the divergence of the European and Asian lineages.<ref name=Belezal2012 />

====Europe====
A number of genes have been positively associated with the skin pigmentation difference between European and non-European populations. Mutations in SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 are believed to account for the bulk of this variation and show very strong signs of selection. Research indicates they may have originated as recently within the last 20,000 years.<ref name=Belezal2012 /><ref name="pmid17446367"/> A variation in TYR has also been identified as a contributor.

===Albinism===
[[Oculocutaneous albinism]] (OCA) is a lack of pigment in the eyes, skin and sometimes hair that occasionally occurs in a very small fraction of the population. The four known types of ''OCA'' are caused by mutations in the ''TYR'', ''OCA2'', ''[[TYRP1]]'', and ''SLC45A2'' genes.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/203100 ALBINISM, OCULOCUTANEOUS, TYPE IA; OCA1A], Johns Hopkins University</ref>

==Evolution of skin color==
It is theorized that about 1.5 million years ago, the earth endured a [[megadrought]] that drove hominids from lush rainforests into arid, open landscapes. This, coupled with the loss of dense body hair, caused early human skin to endure excess UV-B radiation and xeric stress.<ref name=Elias2010 /> Rogers ''et al.'' (2004) performed an examination of the variation in MC1R nucleotide sequences for people of different ancestry and compared the sequences of [[chimpanzees]] and [[humans]] from various regions of the Earth. Rogers concluded that roughly five million years ago, at the time of the evolutionary separation of chimpanzees and humans, the common ancestors of all humans had light skin that was covered by dark hair. Additionally, our closest extant relative, the chimpanzee, has light skin covered by thick body hair.<ref name=rogers2004>{{Harvnb|Rogers|Iltis|Wooding|2004|p=107}}.</ref> Human hair gradually disappeared to allow better heat dissipation through sweating<ref name=jablonski2000>{{cite journal |last1=Jablonski |first1=Nina G. |last2=Jablonski |first2=George |last3=Chaplin |pmid=10896812 |title=The evolution of human skin coloration |year=2000 |pages=57–106 |issue=1 |volume=39 |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |url=http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/chem/faculty/leontis/chem447/PDF_files/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.pdf |doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0403}}</ref> and the skin tone grew darker to increase the [[Stratum corneum|epidermal permeability barrier]]<ref name=Elias2010>{{cite journal |last1=Elias |first1=Peter M |last2=Menon  |first2=Gapinathan |last3=Wetzel |first3=Bruce J |last4=Williams |first4=John (Jack) W| journal=American Journal of Human Biology| pmid=20209486 |year=2010 |volume=22 | issue=4| pages=526–537| title=Barrier Requirements as the Evolutionary "Driver" of Epidermal Pigmentation in Humans| doi=10.1002/ajhb.21043 | pmc=3071612}}</ref> and protect from [[Folic acid|folate]] [[Folate deficiency|depletion]] due to the increased exposure to sunlight.<ref name=pmid20445093/> By 1.2 million years ago, around the time of [[homo ergaster]] and [[homo erectus]], the ancestors of all people living today had exactly the same receptor protein as modern Africans.<ref name="rogers2004"/> Evolutionary pressure meant that any gene variations that resulted in lighter skin were less likely to survive under the intense African sun, and human skin remained dark for the next 1.1 million years.

About 70,000–100,000 years ago some modern humans began to migrate away from the tropics to the north where they were exposed to less intense sunlight, possibly in part due to the need for greater use of clothing to protect against the colder climate. Under these conditions there was less photodestruction of [[folic acid|folate]] and so the evolutionary pressure stopping lighter-skinned gene variants from surviving was reduced. In addition, lighter skin is able to generate more [[vitamin D]] (cholecalciferol) than darker skin so it would have represented a health benefit in reduced sunlight if there were limited sources of vitamin D.<ref name=jablonski2000 /> Hence the leading hypothesis for the evolution of human skin color proposes that:

# From ~1.2 million years ago to less than 100,000 years ago, the ancestors of all people alive were dark-skinned Africans.
# As populations began to migrate, the evolutionary constraint keeping skin dark decreased proportionally to the distance north a population migrated, resulting in a range of skin tones within northern populations.
# At some point, northern populations experienced positive selection for lighter skin due to the increased production of vitamin D from sunlight and the genes for darker skin disappeared from these populations.

The genetic mutations leading to light skin, though different among East Asians and Europeans,<ref name="Norton2006" /> suggest the two groups experienced a similar selective pressure due to settlement in northern latitudes.<ref name=pmid19481954>{{cite journal |last1=Juzeniene |first1=Asta |last2=Setlow |first2=Richard |last3=Porojnicu |first3=Alina |last4=Steindal |first4=Arnfinn Hykkerud |last5=Moan |first5=Johan |title=Development of different human skin colors: A review highlighting photobiological and photobiophysical aspects |journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology |volume=96 |pages=93–100 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2009.04.009 |pmid=19481954 |issue=2}}</ref>

There is a long-standing hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin due to higher vitamin D absorption occurred soon after the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa]] migration some time before 40,000 years ago. A number of researchers disagree with this and suggest that the northern latitudes permitted enough [[Vitamin D#Production in the skin|synthesis of vitamin D]] combined with food sources from hunting to keep populations healthy, and only when agriculture was adopted was there a need for lighter skin to maximize the synthesis of vitamin D. The theory suggests that the reduction of game meat, fish, and some plants from the diet resulted in skin turning light many thousands of years after settlement in Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=R. |last2=Khan |first2=B.S.

One of the most recently proposed drivers of the evolution of skin pigmentation in humans is based on research that shows a superior barrier function in darkly pigmented skin. Most protective functions of the skin, including the permeability barrier and the antimicrobial barrier, reside in the [[stratum corneum]] (SC) and the researchers surmise that the SC has undergone the most genetic change since the loss of human body hair. [[Natural selection]] would have favored mutations that protect this essential barrier; one such protective adaptation is the pigmentation of [[Hair follicle|interfollicular]] [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], because it improves barrier function as compared to non-pigmented skin. In lush rainforests, however, where UV-B radiation and xeric stress were not in excess, light pigmentation would not have been nearly as detrimental. This explains the side-by-side residence of lightly pigmented and darkly pigmented peoples.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elias|first=P. M.|coauthors=G. Menon, B. K. Wetzel, J. W. Williams|title=Barrier requirements as the evolutionary "driver" of epidermal pigmentation in humans|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|year=2010|volume=22|pages=526–537|doi=10.1002/ajhb.21043|pmid=20209486|pmc=3071612}}</ref>

==Sexual dimorphism==

In the same population it has been observed that adult human [[Woman|females]] are considerably lighter in skin pigmentation than the [[Man|males]]. An explanation regarding this form of [[sexual dimorphism]] is related to the known fact that human females require high amounts of calcium during [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]]. They are able to achieve this high amount of calcium by absorbing and synthesizing vitamin D in the skin, thus females must have lighter skin than males in the same environment. This is considered a form of natural selection because the offspring of females with a vitamin D and calcium deficiency could have had various birth defects such as [[spina bifida]], which could then lead to deaths.<ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=N.G.|coauthors=Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2000|volume=39|series=57-106}}</ref>

==Irregular pigmentation==
Uneven pigmentation of some sort affects most people, regardless of ethnic background or skin color. Skin may either appear lighter or darker than normal; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or freckling. Skin pigmentation disorders occur because the body produces either too much or too little melanin.

Increased melanin production, also known as [[hyperpigmentation]], can be:

* [[Melasma]] describes the darkening of the skin.
* [[Chloasma]] describes skin discolorations caused by hormones. These hormonal changes are usually the result of pregnancy, birth control pills or estrogen replacement therapy.
* [[Solar lentigo]], also known as "liver spots" or "senile freckles" refers to darkened spots on the skin caused by aging and the sun. These spots are quite common in adults with a long history of unprotected sun exposure.

Aside from sun exposure and hormones, hyperpigmentation can be caused by skin damage, such as remnants of blemishes, wounds or rashes.<ref>Cutis, August 2005, pp 19-23</ref> This is especially true for those with darker skin tones.

The most typical cause of darkened areas of skin, brown spots or areas of discoloration is unprotected sun exposure. Once incorrectly referred to as [[liver spots]], these pigment problems are not connected with the liver.

On lighter to medium skin tones, solar lentigenes emerge as small- to medium-sized brown patches of freckling that can grow and accumulate over time on areas of the body that receive the most unprotected sun exposure, such as the back of the hands, forearms, chest, and face. For those with darker skin colors, these discolorations can appear as patches or areas of ashen-gray skin.

==Exposure to sun==
{{see also|Sun tanning}}
[[Melanin]] in the skin protects the body by absorbing solar radiation. In general, the more melanin there is in the skin the more solar radiation can be absorbed. Excessive solar radiation causes [[direct DNA damage|direct]] and [[indirect DNA damage]] to the skin and the body naturally combats and seeks to repair the damage and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin's cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens, but can also cause sunburn. The tanning process can also be created by artificial UV radiation.

There are two different mechanisms involved. Firstly, the UVA-radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidizes existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin. Secondly, there is an increase in production of melanin ([[melanogenesis]]).<ref name="Agar2005">{{cite journal |author=Agar, Nita; Young, Antony R. |title=Melanogenesis: a photoprotective response to DNA damage? |journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis |volume=571 |issue=1–2 |pages=121–132 |year=2005 |pmid=15748643 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.11.016}}</ref> Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning and first becomes visible about 72 hours after exposure. The tan that is created by an increased melanogenesis lasts much longer than the one that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin.

A person's natural skin color has an impact on their reaction to exposure to the sun. The tone of human skin can vary from a dark brown to a nearly colorless pigmentation, which may appear reddish due to the blood in the skin. Europeans generally have lighter skin, hair, and eyes than any other group, although this is not always the case. Africans generally have darker skin, hair, and eyes, although this too is not universal. For practical purposes, such as exposure time for [[sun tanning]], six skin types are distinguished following Fitzpatrick (1975), listed in order of decreasing lightness:<ref>{{harvnb|Weller et al|2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sunsmart.org.uk/skin-cancer-facts/your-skin-type/ SunSmart Homepage : Cancer Research UK].

Dark skin with large concentrations of melanin protects against [[ultraviolet]] light and [[skin cancer]]s; light-skinned people have about a tenfold greater risk of dying from skin cancer, compared with dark-skinned persons, under equal [[sunlight]] exposure.

==Geographic variation==
[[File:Unlabeled Renatto Luschan Skin color map.svg|thumb|350px|right|Map of [[indigenous people|indigenous]] skin color distribution in the world based on [[Von Luschan's chromatic scale]].]]

[[File:Stoddard race map 1920.jpg||thumb|300px|Global racial map by [[Eugenicist]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]] in ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]''.]]

Approximately 10% of the variance in skin color occurs within regions, and ~90% occurs between regions.<ref>Relethford 2002.</ref>
Because skin color has been under strong selective pressure, similar skin colors can result from convergent adaptation rather than from genetic relatedness, populations with similar pigmentation may be genetically no more similar than other widely separated groups. Furthermore, in some parts of the world where people from different regions have mixed extensively, the connection between skin color and ancestry has substantially weakened.<ref>Parra et al 2004.</ref> In Brazil, for example, skin color is not closely associated with the percentage of recent African ancestors a person has, as estimated from an analysis of genetic variants differing in frequency among continent groups.<ref>Parra et al 2003.</ref>

Considerable speculation has surrounded the possible adaptive value of other physical features characteristic of groups, such as the constellation of facial features observed in many eastern and northeastern Asians.<ref>Guthrie 1996.</ref> However, any given physical characteristic generally is found in multiple groups,<ref>Lahr 1996.</ref> and demonstrating that environmental selective pressures shaped specific physical features is difficult, since such features may result from sexual selection for individuals with certain appearances or from [[genetic drift]].<ref>Roseman 2004.</ref>

==Social status, colorism and racism==
{{Main|Colorism}}
[[Image:Felix von Luschan Skin Color Chart.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Skin colors according to [[von Luschan's chromatic scale]]]] According to classical scholar Frank Snowden, skin color did not determine [[social status]] in ancient [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] or [[Rome]]. Relations between the major power and the subordinate state was viewed as more significant in a person's status than was their skin color.<ref>{{harvnb|Snowden|1970}}.</ref>

The preferred skin tone varies by culture and has varied over time. A number of indigenous African groups, such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], associated pale skin with being cursed or caused by evil spirits associated with witchcraft. They would abandon their children born with conditions such as [[albinism]] and showed a sexual preference for darker skin.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200909101054.html Africa: Dispelling Myths about Albinism], Pambazuka News, 10 September 2009</ref>

Many cultures have historically favored lighter skin for women. In Europe, before the [[Industrial Revolution]], pale skin was preferred and was a sign of high social status. The poorer classes worked outdoors and got darker skin from exposure to the sun, while the upper class stayed indoors and had light skin. Light skin became associated with wealth and high position.<ref name=DrKarl>{{citation |first=Karl |last=Kruszelnicki |title=News in Science: Skin Colour 1 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/03/01/249992.htm?site=science/greatmomentsinscience}}</ref> Women would even put lead-based cosmetics on their skin to artificially whiten their skin tone.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal | url = http://journals.lww.com/melanomaresearch/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2006&issue=02000&article=00012&type=abstract | last1 = Agredano | title = Accessibility to air travel correlates strongly with increasing melanoma incidence | first1 = YZ | last2 = Chan | first2 = JL | last3 = Kimball | first3 = RC | last4 = Kimball | first4 = AB | author8 = Agredano, Yolanda Z.; Chan, Joanna L.; Kimball, Ranch C.; Kimball, Alexa B. | journal = Melanoma Research | date = February 2006 | volume =  16 | issue =  1 | pmid = 16432460 | pages = 77–81 | doi = 10.1097/01.cmr.0000195696.50390.23 }}</ref> However, when not strictly monitored, these cosmetics caused [[lead poisoning]].

Colonization and slavery by European countries inspired [[Discrimination based on skin color|colorism]] and [[racism]], led by the belief that people with dark skin were uncivilized, inferior, and should be subordinate to the lighter skinned invaders.
