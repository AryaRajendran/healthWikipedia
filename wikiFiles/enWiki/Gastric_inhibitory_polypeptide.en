'''Gastric inhibitory polypeptide''' ('''GIP'''), also known as the '''glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide''' is a member of the secretin family of [[hormone]]s.<ref name="pmid15759282">{{cite journal | author = Meier JJ, Nauck MA | title = Glucagon-like peptide 1(GLP-1) in biology and pathology | journal = Diabetes Metab.

GIP, along with [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1), belongs to a class of molecules referred to as [[incretin]]s.<ref name="pmid15655702">{{cite journal | author = Efendic S, Portwood N | title = Overview of incretin hormones | journal = Horm. Metab. Res. | volume = 36 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 742–6 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15655702 | doi = 10.1055/s-2004-826157 }}</ref>

==Synthesis and transport==
GIP is derived from a 153-amino acid proprotein encoded by the GIP gene and circulates as a biologically active 42-amino acid peptide. It is synthesized by K cells, which are found in the [[mucosa]] of the [[duodenum]] and the [[jejunum]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  

Like all [[endocrine]] [[hormones]], it is transported by blood.  

[[Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor]]s are seven-transmembrane proteins found on [[beta-cells]] in the [[pancreas]].

==Function==
It has traditionally been called ''gastrointestinal inhibitory peptide'' or ''gastric inhibitory peptide'' and was believed to neutralize [[stomach acid]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  to protect the [[small intestine]] from acid damage, reduce the rate at which [[food]] is transferred through the [[stomach]], and inhibit the GI motility and secretion of acid. However, this is incorrect, as it was discovered that these effects are achieved only with higher-than-normal physiological level, and that these results naturally occur in the body through a similar [[hormone]], [[secretin]]. 

It is now believed that the function of GIP is to induce [[insulin]] secretion, which is stimulated primarily by [[osmolarity|hyperosmolarity]] of [[glucose]] in the duodenum.<ref name="pmid8586147">{{cite journal | author = Thorens B | title = Glucagon-like peptide-1 and control of insulin secretion | journal = Diabète & métabolisme | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 311–8 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8586147 | doi = | issn = }}</ref> After this discovery, some researchers prefer the new name of ''glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide'', while retaining the [[acronym]] "GIP."  The amount of insulin secreted is greater when glucose is administered orally than intravenously.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boulpaep|first=[edited by] Walter F. Boron, Emile L.|title=Medical physiology : a cellular and molecular approach|year=2009|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9781416031154|edition=2nd ed., International ed.}}</ref> 

GIP is also thought to have significant effects on [[fatty acid metabolism]] through stimulation of [[lipoprotein lipase]] activity in [[adipocyte]]s. GIP release has been demonstrated in the ruminant animal and may play a role in nutrient partitioning in milk production (lipid metabolism). GIP is secreted in response to the first maternal feed (colostrum) in goat kids—GIP being measured via umbilical vein before its closure. For ethical reasons, GIP secretion has been demonstrated in humans only at approx 10 days of age. With respect to the role of GIP in lipid metabolism, supraphysiological levels have shown a lipogenic action, however the action of collagenase in experimental protocols is known to degrade GIP/ GIP receptors. GIP is part of the diffuse endocrine system and, as a consequence, difficult to demonstrate physiological or clinical effects. In comparison to insulin its effects are very subtle. Furthermore, GIP has been shown to participate to bone remodelling through modification of the adipokine network.<ref name="pmid23220186">{{cite journal | author = Gaudin-Audrain C, Irwin N, Mansur S, Flatt PR, Thorens B, Basle M, Chappard D, Mabilleau G | title = Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor deficiency leads to modifications of trabecular bone volume and quality in mice | journal = Bone | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 221–30 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23220186 | doi = 10.1016/j.bone.2012.11.039 }}</ref>

==Pathology ==
It has been found that [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetics]] are not responsive to GIP and have lower levels of GIP secretion after a meal when compared to non-diabetics.<ref name="pmid20406045">{{cite journal | author = Skrha J, Hilgertová J, Jarolímková M, Kunešová M, Hill M | title = Meal test for glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) in obese and type 2 diabetic patients | journal = Physiol Res | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 749–55 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20406045 | doi = }}</ref> In research involving [[knockout mice]], it was found that absence of the GIP receptors correlates with resistance to [[obesity]].<ref name="pmid15655707">{{cite journal | author = Yamada Y, Seino Y | title = Physiology of GIP—a lesson from GIP receptor knockout mice | journal = Horm.
