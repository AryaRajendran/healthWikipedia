[[File:Kuwadzana open drain.JPG|250px|thumb|left|An open drain in [[Kuwadzana]] township, [[Harare]] in 2004.

The principal cause of the outbreak is lack of access to [[potable water|safe water]] in urban areas and communities.  A unique feature of Zimbabwe is that its two main cities are located on watershed divides, which means that the water draining out of the city flows into the drinking water sources, all of which are physically located downstream of these return flows.<ref name="environment.co.za">http://www.environment.co.za/documents/water/KeynoteAddressCSIR2008.pdf</ref> This is exacerbated by the collapse of the urban [[water supply]],<ref name="Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic hits 10,000 ">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/3536824/Zimbabwes-cholera-epidemic-hits-10000.html|title=Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic hits 10,000 |date=1 Dec 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2008-12-02 | location=London | first=Peta | last=Thornycroft}}</ref> [[sanitation]]<ref name=collapse/> and [[Waste management|garbage collection systems]],<ref name=storm/> along with the onset of the rainy season leading to [[faeces]] with cholera bacteria being washed into water sources, in particular public drains,<ref name=rain/> as well as providing readily available but contaminated water.<ref name=coping>{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/zimbabwe-feature-261108?opendocument|title=Zimbabwe: coping with the cholera outbreak|date=26 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> Due to a shortage of purification chemicals, such as chlorine, the capital city of [[Harare]] stopped receiving piped water on 1 December 2008.<ref name=mobilize/> By that date, many suburbs had not had any water supply for much longer.<ref name=3000dead/> On 4 December 2008, the Zimbabwe deputy minister for water and infrastructural development stated that there were only sufficient treatment chemicals in stock nationally for twelve weeks supply.<ref name=appeal>{{cite news|url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL4384569.html|title=Zimbabwe appeals for donor help on cholera|date=4 Dec 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> The collapse of these systems has frequently been blamed on the current [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|economic crisis]].<ref name="Capital lacks clean water, cholera kills hundreds in Zimbabwe"/><ref name=oxfam/> Attempts have also been made to attribute the blame to colonial rule, although Zimbabwe had become a fully independent nation 28 years earlier, in 1980.<ref name=racist>{{cite news|url=http://www1.sundaymail.co.zw/inside.aspx?sectid=1021&cat=18|title=Water woes a creation of racist Rhodesia|date=6 December 2008|publisher=The Sunday Mail|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref> Many households cannot even afford sufficient fuel to boil all of their water.<ref name=oxfam2/> According to [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], the spread of cholera from urban to rural areas from December 2008 onwards was due to infected city-dwellers visiting their families' rural homes for [[Christmas]] and the burial of infected city-dwellers in rural areas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cholera moves to rural Zimbabwe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7844417.stm|date=22 Jan 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref> In an investigation in mid-December 2008, human rights organization [[Physicians For Human Rights]] assessed the complicated circumstances surrounding the collapse of Zimbabwe's public health system, which had once been a model for southern Africa.<ref>Physicians for Human Rights.
