The discovery of [[disease]]-causing [[pathogen]]s is an important activity in the field of medical science, as many [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[fungi]], [[helminthes]] and [[prion]]s are identified as a confirmed or potential pathogen. A [[Center for Disease Control]] program begun in 1995 identified over a hundred patients, with life threatening illnesses which were considered to be of an [[Infection|infectious]] cause, but could not be linked to a known pathogen.<ref name="DAY_1997">{{cite journal |author=Day M |title=Stalking the diseases with no name |journal=The New Scientist  | date=June 7, 1997 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420850.600-stalking-the-diseases-with-no-name.html}}</ref>  The association of pathogens with disease can be a complex and controversial process, in some cases requiring decades or even centuries to achieve.

==Factors impairing identification of pathogens==
Factors which have been identified as impeding the identification of pathogens include the following:

:'''1. Lack of animal models''': Experimental infection in animals has been used as a criterion to demonstrate a disease-causing ability, but for some pathogens (such as ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which cause disease only in humans) animal models do not exist. In cases where animal models were not available, scientists have sometimes infected themselves or others to determine an organism's disease causing ability.<ref name=autobiography>{{cite web  | last =Barry   | first =Marshall  | title =Autobiography  | publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]]  | year =2005  | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-autobio.html  | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | authorlink = Barry Marshall}}</ref>

:'''2. Pre-existing theories of disease''': Before a pathogen is well-recognized, scientists may attribute the symptoms of infection to other causes, such as [[Toxicology|toxicological]], [[Psychosomatic illness|psychological]], or [[Genetics|genetic]] causes. Once a pathogen has been associated with an illness, researchers have reported difficulty displacing these pre-existing theories.<ref name="MARSHALL_2002">{{cite book  | last = Marshall  | first = Barry  | title = Helicobacter Pioneers: Firsthand Accounts from the Scientists who Discovered Helicobacters, 1892-1982  | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Limited  | date = May 1, 2002  | isbn = 978-0-86793-035-1}}</ref><ref name="BENT_1995">{{cite journal |author=Bentivoglio M, Pacini P |title=Filippo Pacini: a determined observer |journal=Brain Res.

Some scientists opposed the new theory, and even drank cholera cultures to disprove it:

{{"
|Koch announced his discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1884. His conclusions were based upon the constant finding of the peculiar "comma bacillus" in the stools of cholera patients, and the failure to demonstrate this organism in the feces of other persons. It was not possible to reproduce typical cholera in laboratory animals. At the time the "germ theory" of disease had not yet obtained general acceptance, and Koch's announcement was received with considerable skepticism, particularly after it was found that similar "comma bacilli" could be found at times in the feces of persons not suffering from cholera, and often in all sorts of other environments - well and river waters, cheese, etc. We now know that these were saprotrophic species of Vibrio, which may be differentiated from the cholera vibrio by cultural and immunological methods. But the correctness of Koch's opinion was dramatically demonstrated by von Pettenkofer and Emmerich who, doubting the etiological relationship of Koch's organisms, deliberately drank cultures of it. Von Pettenkofer developed merely a transient diarrhea, but Emmerich suffered from a typical and severe attack of cholera. 
|by A. T. Henrici, ''The Biology of Bacteria'', DC Heath and Company, 1939. ASIN B00085GABK, 
}}

Von Pettenkofer considered his experience proof that ''Vibrio cholerae'' was harmless, as he did not develop cholera from consuming the culture.  Between 1849 when Pouchet discovered ''Vibrio cholerae'' and 1891, over a million people died in cholera epidemics in Europe and Russia.<ref name="STITT_1922">{{cite book  | last = Stitt  | first = Edward  | title = The Diagnosis and Treatment of Tropical Diseases  | publisher = P.

If too many of them occur in a person, they will develop [[cystic fibrosis]], an incurable and often fatal genetic disorder.

===''Giardia lamblia'' (1681-1975)===

Giardiasis is a disease caused by infection with the protozoan ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''.  Infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' can produce diarrhea, gas, and abdominal pain in some people. If untreated, infection can be chronic. In children, chronic ''[[Giardia]]'' infection can cause [[stunting]] (stunted growth) and lowered intelligence,<ref name="ALI_2003">{{cite journal |author=Ali SA, Hill DR |title=Giardia intestinalis |journal=Curr.

However, ''[[Giardia]]'' experienced an extraordinarily long term of emergence, from its discovery in 1681, until the 1970s when it was fully accepted that infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' was a treatable cause of chronic diarrhea:

{{"
|''Giardia lamblia'' was first discovered by Leeuwenhoeck (1681) who found the parasite in his own {diarrheal} stools. It was long considered to be a harmless commensal organism, but in recent years has been recognized as a cause of intestinal disease often acquired by travelers to foreign countries, persons drinking contaminated water in this country, children in day care nurseries and homosexual males. It is the most common pathogenic intestinal parasite in the United States, being found in 4% of stool specimens submitted to state public health laboratories for parasite examination. Attesting to its increasing importance in the United States, a symposium on Giardiasis, sponsored by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], was held in the Fall of 1978.<ref name="SMITH_1980" />

}}

Some of the first evidence in modern times of ''Giardia's'' pathogenicity came during [[World War II]] when soldiers were treated for [[malaria]] with the antiprotozoal [[Quinacrine]], and their diarrhea disappeared, as did the ''[[Giardia]]'' from their stool samples. In 1954, Dr. R.C. Rendtorff  performed experiments on prisoner volunteers, infecting them with ''[[Giardia]]''.<ref name="RENDTORFF">{{cite journal |author=RENDTORFF RC |title=The experimental transmission of human intestinal protozoan parasites.

The communication was re-published in the ''EPA Symposium on Waterborne Transmission of Giardiasis'' in 1979, and that version included the following quote from the Director of the Oregon State Board of Health, suggesting that diarrhea from ''[[Giardia]]'' was still being attributed to other causes by health authorities in 1954:

===''Helicobacter pylori'' (1892-1982)===

Infection with the bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' is the cause of most stomach ulcers. The discovery is generally credited to Australian gastroenterologists Dr. [[Barry Marshall]] and Dr. J Robin Warren, who published their findings in 1983. The pair received the Nobel Prize in 2005 for their work. Before this, nobody really knew what caused stomach ulcers, though a popular belief was that the "stress" played a role. Some researchers suggested that ulcers were a [[psychosomatic]] illness.<ref name="PAULLEY_1975">{{cite journal |author=Paulley JW |title=Cultural influences on the incidence and pattern of disease |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |year=1975 |pmid=1178798 |doi=10.1159/000286889}}</ref><ref name="KELLNER_1975">{{cite journal |author=Kellner R |title=Psychotherapy in psychosomatic disorders |journal=Arch.

In ''H Pylori Pioneers'', Dr. Marshall noted that other physicians had produced evidence of ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection as early as 1892.<ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /> Marshall writes that earlier reports were disregarded because they conflicted with existing belief. The first description of ''H. Pylori'' came in 1892 from Giulio Bizzozero, who identified acid-tolerant bacteria living in a dog’s stomach. Later, a theory would be developed that no bacteria could live in the stomach.<ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /> Although the theory has no scientific basis, it would become a stumbling block for scientists, discouraging them for searching for infective causes of stomach ulcers. In 1940, two physicians, Dr. A. Stone Freeberg and Dr. Louis E. Barron published a paper describing a spiral bacteria found in about half of their gastroenterology patients who had stomach ulcers. Dr. [[John Lykoudis]], a Greek physician, was one of the first physicians to treat stomach ulcers as an infectious disease. Between 1960 and 1970, he treated over 10,000 ulcer patients in Athens with antibiotics.<ref name="RIGAS_1999">{{cite journal |author=Rigas B, Feretis C, Papavassiliou ED |title=John Lykoudis: an unappreciated discoverer of the cause and treatment of peptic ulcer disease |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9190 |pages=1634–5 |year=1999 |pmid=10560691 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)06034-1}}</ref>  Lykoudis tried to publish a paper on his findings, but they conflicted with traditional theory, and his work was never published.<ref name="MARSHALL_2002" />  Lykoudis' experience was followed in 1975 by a further publication in Gut magazine that included spiral bacteria living on the borders of duodonal ulcers.<ref name="STEER_1975">{{cite journal |author=Steer HW, Colin-Jones DG |title=Mucosal changes in gastric ulceration and their response to carbenoxolone sodium |journal=Gut |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=590–7 |year=1975 |pmid=810394 |doi=10.1136/gut.16.8.590 |pmc=1411007}}</ref> The medical significance of Steer’s findings was disregarded, but he “continued to publish papers on ''[[H. Pylori]]'', mostly as a hobby."<ref name="MARSHALL_2002" />

''[[H. pylori]]'' can infect the stomach of some people without causing stomach ulcers. In investigating asymptomatic carriers of ''[[H. pylori]]'', researchers identified a genetic trait called Interleuik-1 beta-31 which causes increased production of stomach acid, resulting in ulcers if patients become infected with ''[[H. pylori]]''. Patients without the trait do not develop stomach ulcers in response to ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection, but instead have increased risk from stomach cancer if they become infected.<ref name="EL-OMAR_2000" /> Investigation into other gastrointestinal infections has also shown that the symptoms are the result of interaction between the infection and specific genetic mutations in the host.

There are different types of [[E. coli]], some of which are found in humans and are harmless.  [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli]] (ETEC) is a type found to cause illness in humans, possessing [[gene]] that allows it to manufacture a substance toxic to humans.

Two species of HIV infect humans: [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]]. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is not as easily transmitted and is largely confined to [[West Africa]].<ref name=Reeves>{{cite journal

It is hypothesized that HIV probably transferred to humans as a result of direct contact with primates, for instance during hunting, butchery, or inter-species sexual contact.<ref name=CohenOrigns>{{cite journal

===''Cyclospora'' (1995)===

[[Cyclospora]] is a gastrointestinal pathogen that causes fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and severe weight loss.  Outbreaks of the disease occurred in [[Chicago]] in 1989 and other areas in the United States.<ref name="GOLEMAN_1995">{{cite news   | last = Goleman  | first =Daniel  | title = Tiny Clinic in Katmandy Solves Mystery  | publisher = New York Times  | date = January 3, 1995  | url =  http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD7163AF930A35752C0A963958260&sec=travel&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink  | accessdate = 2007-08-08 }}</ref> But investigation by the [[Center for Disease Control]] could not identify an infectious cause. The discovery of the cause was made by Mr. Ramachandran Rajah, the head of a medical clinic's laboratory in [[Katmandu]], Nepal. Mr. Rajah was trying to discover why local residents and visitors were becoming ill every summer.<ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /> He identified an unusual looking organism in stool samples from patients who were sick. But when the clinic sent slides of the organism to the [[Center for Disease Control]], it was identified as Blue-Green algae, which is harmless. Many pathologists had seen the same thing before, but dismissed it as irrelevant to the patient's disease.<ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /> Later, the organism would be identified as a special kind of parasite, and treatment would be developed to help patients with the infection. In the United States, [[Cyclospora]] infection must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]] according to the [http://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/phs/infdis2007r.htm CDC's Reportable Disease Chart]

==Present day discoveries==

The process of identifying new infectious agents continues. One study has suggested there are a large number of pathogens already causing illness in the population, but they have not yet been properly identified.<ref name="DAY_1997" />

===Gastrointestinal pathogens===
