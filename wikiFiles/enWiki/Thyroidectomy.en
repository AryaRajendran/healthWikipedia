A '''thyroidectomy''' is an operation that involves the [[surgery|surgical]] removal of all or part of the [[thyroid gland]].  Surgeons often perform a thyroidectomy when a patient has thyroid [[cancer]] or some other condition of the thyroid [[gland]] (such as [[hyperthyroidism]]) or goiter.  Other indications for surgery include cosmetic (very enlarged thyroid), or symptomatic obstruction (causing difficulties in swallowing or breathing). Thyroidectomy is a common surgical procedure that has several potential complications or sequela including: temporary or permanent change in voice, temporary or permanently low calcium, need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement, bleeding, infection, and the remote possibility of airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis.  Complications are uncommon when the procedure is performed by an experienced surgeon.

The thyroid produces several [[hormone]]s, such as [[thyroxine]] (T4), [[triiodothyronine]] (T3), and [[calcitonin]]. 

After the removal of a thyroid, patients usually take a prescribed oral synthetic thyroid hormone - [[levothyroxine]] (Synthroid) - to prevent [[hypothyroidism]].

Less extreme variants of thyroidectomy include:
* "hemithyroidectomy" (or "unilateral lobectomy") -- removing only half of the thyroid
* "isthmectomy" -- removing the band of tissue (or [[isthmus]]) connecting the two lobes of the thyroid

A "thyroidectomy" should not be confused with a "[[thyroidotomy]]" ("[[thyrotomy]]"), which is a ''cutting into'' (-otomy) the thyroid, not a ''removal'' (-ectomy) of it. A thyroidotomy can be performed to get access for a [[median laryngotomy]], or to perform a [[biopsy]]. (Although technically a biopsy involves removing some tissue, it is more frequently categorized as an -otomy than an -ectomy because the volume of tissue removed is minuscule.)

== Indications ==
* [[Thyroid cancer]]
* Toxic [[thyroid nodule]] (produces too much thyroid hormone)
* Multinodular [[goiter]] (enlarged thyroid gland with many nodules), especially if there is compression of nearby structures
* [[Graves' disease]], especially if there is [[exophthalmos]] (bulging eyes)
* Thyroid nodule, if [[Fine-needle aspiration|fine needle aspirate]] (FNA) results are unclear<ref name="Current">

== Types of Thyroidectomy==
# Hemithyroidectomy - Entire isthmus is removed along with 1 lobe. Done in benign diseases of only 1 lobe.
# [[Subtotal thyroidectomy]] - Done in toxic thyroid, primary or secondary, and also for toxic multinodular goiter (MNG).
# Partial thyroidectomy - Removal of gland in front of trachea after mobilization. Done in nontoxic MNG. Its role is controversial.
# [[Near total thyroidectomy]] - Both lobes are removed except for a small amount of thyroid tissue (on one or both sides) in the vicinity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve entry point and the superior parathyroid gland. Done in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
#[[Total thyroidectomy]] - Entire gland is removed. Done in case of follicular carcinoma of thyroid, medullary carcinoma of thyroid.
#[[Hartley Dunhill operation]] - Removal of 1 entire lateral lobe with isthmus and partial/subtotal removal of opposite lateral lobe. Done in nontoxic MNG.

== Steps ==
Main steps of Thyroidectomy:<ref name="Current" />

# Horizontal anterior neck incision (if possible, within a skin crease)
# Create upper and lower flaps between the [[platysma]] and [[infrahyoid muscles|strap muscles]]
# Divide vertically between the strap muscles and [[anterior jugular veins]]
# Separate the strap muscles from the thyroid gland
# Divide the [[middle thyroid vein]]
# Mobilize the superior pole of the thyroid lobe.  Divide the superior thyroid artery and vein close to the thyroid gland (avoid injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and the superior [[parathyroid gland]])
# Identify the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] whenever possible using the nerve monitoring device
# Identify the inferior parathyroid artery
# Divide the inferior thyroid artery and vein
# Separate the thyroid lobe and isthmus from the trachea
# Repeat this process for the other thyroid lobe.  Remove the thyroid gland
# Reapproximate the strap muscles
# Reapproximate the platysma muscle
# Close the skin with a subcuticular stitch

== Complications ==

#[[Hypothyroidism]]/[[Thyroid insufficiency]] in up to 50% of patients after ten years
#[[Laryngeal nerve]] injury in about 1% of patients, in particular the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]]: Unilateral damage results in a hoarse voice. Bilateral damage presents as laryngeal obstruction after surgery and can be a surgical emergency: an emergency [[tracheostomy]] may be needed. Recurrent Laryngeal nerve injury may occur during the ligature of the inferior thyroid artery.
# [[Hypoparathyroidism]] temporary (transient) in many patients, but permanent in about 1-4% of patients
# [[Anesthetic]] complications
# [[Infection]]
# Stitch [[granuloma]]
# [[Chyle]] leak
# [[Haemorrhage]]/[[Hematoma]] (This may compress the airway, becoming life-threatening.)
# Surgical [[scar]]/[[keloid]]
# Removal or devascularization of the parathyroids.
# Thyroid storm in operations performed for hyperthyroidism
