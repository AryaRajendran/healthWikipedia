'''Arnold J. Levine''', is a [[United States]] [[Molecular biologist]]. He was awarded the 1998 [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize for Biology or Biochemistry]] and was the first recipient of the [[Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research]] in 2001 for his discovery of the [[tumor suppressor protein]] [[p53]].<ref>{{citation|title=Scientist Wins Prize for Work on Cancer Gene|first=Lawrence K.|last=Altman|date=March 15, 2001|journal=[[New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/15/nyregion/scientist-wins-prize-for-work-on-cancer-gene.html}}.</ref> 

He is currently Professor of Systems Biology at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/faculty-and-emeriti/levine Faculty profile], [[Institute for Advanced Study]], retrieved 2011-05-12.</ref>

==Career==
Levine discovered, with several colleagues, the [[p53]] [[tumor suppressor gene]] in 1979, a protein involved in [[cell cycle]] regulation, and one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer, in work done as a professor in the biochemistry department at [[Princeton University]].  In 1979 Levine moved to become Chairman of the Department of Microbiology at [[Stony Brook School of Medicine]] before moving back to Princeton in 1984. 

In 1998 Levine became the Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor of Cancer Biology and President of [[Rockefeller University]]. While he was President of [[Rockefeller University]], he opted to resign due to allegations that he had an inappropriate sexual encounter with a woman graduate student, under intoxication. According to the involved woman student, the encounter was consensual.<ref>{{citation|title=Amid Inquiry, President of Rockefeller U.

In 2002 he moved to the [[Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]] and in 2004 added a joint appointment as Professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].

==Award and honors==
In addition to the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] ([[Columbia University]]) and Albany Prize Levine has received numerous awards and honors.  He was elected a Member of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] in 1991,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir?sid=1011&view=basic&pg=srch |title=NAS Membership Directory |publisher=[[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate={{Format date|2011|12|4}}}} Search for Arnold Levine.</ref> and a Member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iom.edu/Global/Directory/Detail.aspx?id=0000059468 |title=IOM Membership Directory - Arnold Levine |publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]] |accessdate={{Format date|2011|12|4}}}}</ref> He won the [[Ciba-Drew Award]] in 1995. The importance of p53 in cancer biology led to a number of cancer-related awards, including the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research]] (1994), the [[Charles S. Mott Prize]] from the [[General Motors Cancer Research Foundation]] (1999), the [[Keio Medical Science Prize]] (2000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ms-fund.keio.ac.jp/prize/winner/index.html |title=The Keio Medical Science Prize Laureates |publisher=[[Keio University]] |accessdate={{Format date|2011|12|4}}}}</ref>
