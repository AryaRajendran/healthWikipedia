'''Extensor carpi radialis longus''' is one of the five main [[muscle]]s that control movements at the [[wrist]]. This muscle is quite long, starting on the lateral side of the humerus, and attaching to the base of the [[second metacarpal bone]] (metacarpal of the [[index finger]]).

==Function==
As the name suggests, this muscle is an extensor at the wrist [[joint]] and travels along the radial side of the arm, so will also abduct (radial abduction) the hand at the wrist.<ref name="Platzer-164">Platzer 2004, p 164</ref>  That is, it manipulates the wrist so as to move the hand towards the [[thumb]] (i.e., [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]]&mdash;away from the mid-position of the hand) and away from the palmar side (i.e., [[extension (kinesiology)| extension]]&mdash;increased angle between the palm and the front of the forearm).

==Origin, course, and insertion==
It originates from the [[lateral supracondylar ridge]] of the [[humerus]], from the [[lateral intermuscular septum of arm|lateral intermuscular septum]], and by a few fibers from the [[lateral epicondyle of the humerus|lateral epicondyle]] of the humerus.<ref name="Platzer-164" />

The fibres end at the upper third of the forearm in a flat tendon, which runs along the lateral border of the radius, beneath the [[Abductor pollicis longus]] and [[Extensor pollicis brevis]]; it then passes beneath the [[dorsal carpal ligament]], where it lies in a groove on the back of the radius common to it and the [[Extensor carpi radialis brevis]], immediately behind the [[styloid process (radius)|styloid process]].

One of the three muscles of the [[Mobile wad|radial forearm group]], it initially runs along with [[Brachioradialis muscle|brachioradialis]], but becomes mostly tendon early on.  Passing between brachioradialis and [[Extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle|extensor carpi radialis brevis]], this tendon continues into the second tendon compartment together with the latter muscle.<ref name="Platzer-164" />

It is inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the [[second metacarpal bone]], on its radial side.<ref name="Platzer-164" />

==Innervation==

The extensor carpi radialis longus is a wrist extensor that is innervated by the [[radial nerve]].<ref name="Platzer-164" /> Though the radial nerve receives contributions from vertebrae levels C5, C6, C7, C8 and T1, studies have shown that the neurons that innervate the extensor carpi radialis longus arise from cervical vertebrae levels C6 and C7.<ref>Bradley Bowden, Illustrated Atlas of the Skeletal Muscles, 2005</ref>  All other major extensor muscles in the superficial layer of the posterior compartment (the [[Extensor Digitorum]], [[Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis]], [[Extensor Carpi Ulnaris]], and the [[Extensor Digiti Minimi]]) are innervated by the posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve.

==Exercises==
The muscle, like all extensors of the forearm, can be [[strength training|strengthened]] by exercise that resist its extension. A [[wrist roller]] can be used and [[wrist curl|reverse wrist curls]] with [[dumbbell]]s can performed.
