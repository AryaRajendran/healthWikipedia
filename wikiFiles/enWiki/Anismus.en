'''Anismus''' (or dyssynergic defecation) refers to the failure of the normal relaxation of [[pelvic floor]] muscles during attempted [[defecation]].

Anismus can occur in both children and adults, and in both men and women (although it is more common in women). It can be caused by physical defects or it can occur for other reasons or unknown reasons. Anismus that has a behavioral cause could be viewed as having similarities with [[parcopresis]], or psychogenic fecal retention. 

Symptoms include [[tenesmus]] (a sensation where a mass is felt to remain in rectum after defecation) and [[constipation]]. Retention of stool may result in fecal loading (retention of a mass of stool of any consistency) or [[fecal impaction]] (retention of a mass of hard stool). This mass may stretch the walls of the rectum and colon, causing [[megarectum]] and/or [[megacolon]] respectively. Liquid stool may leak around a fecal impaction, possibly causing degrees of liquid fecal incontinence. This is usually termed [[encopresis]] or soiling in children, and [[fecal leakage]], soiling or liquid [[fecal incontinence]] in adults.

Anismus is usually treated with adjustments to the diet, such as [[dietary fiber]] supplementation. It can also be treated with a type of [[biofeedback]] therapy, where a sensor probe is inserted in the patient's [[anal canal]] and records the pressures exerted by the pelvic floor muscles. These pressures are visually fed back to the patient via a monitor who is able to regain the normal coordinated movement of the muscles after a few sessions.

Some researchers have suggested that anismus is an over-diagnosed condition, since the standard investigations or [[digital rectal examination]] and [[anorectal manometry]] were shown to cause paradoxical sphincter contraction in healthy controls, who did not have constipation or incontinence.<ref name="Paradoxical sphincter contraction is rarely indicative of anismus">{{cite journal|last=Voderholzer|first=W A|coauthors=Neuhaus, D A; Klauser, A G; Tzavella, K; Muller-Lissner, S A; Schindlbeck, N E|title=Paradoxical sphincter contraction is rarely indicative of anismus|journal=Gut|date=1 August 1997|volume=41|issue=2|pages=258–262|doi=10.1136/gut.41.2.258|pmid=9301508|pmc=1891465}}</ref> Due to the invasive and perhaps uncomfortable nature of these investigations, the pelvic floor musculature is thought to behave differently than under normal circumstances. These researchers went on to conclude that paradoxical pelvic floor contraction  common finding in healthy controls as well as in patients with chronic constipation and stool incontinence, and it represents a non-specific finding or laboratory artifact related to untoward conditions during examination, and that true anismus is actually rare.

==Etymology & Synonyms==
Paradoxical anal contraction during attempted defecation in constipated patients was first described in a paper in 1985, when the term anismus was first used.<ref name="Anismus in chronic constipation.">{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=DM|coauthors=Lennard-Jones, JE|title=Anismus in chronic constipation|journal=Digestive diseases and sciences|date=1985 May|volume=30|issue=5|pages=413–8|pmid=3987474|doi=10.1007/BF01318172}}</ref> The researchers drew analogies to a condition called [[vaginismus]], which involves paroxysmal contraction of [[pubococcygeus]] (another muscle of the pelvic floor).  These researchers felt that this condition was a spastic dysfunction of the anus, analogous to ‘vaginismus’. However, the term anismus implies a psychogenic etiology, which is not true although psychological dysfunction has been described in these patients. Hence:

Latin ''ani'' - "of the anus"<br>
Latin ''spasmus'' - "spasm"

(Derived by extrapolation with the term vaginismus, which in turn is from the Latin ''vagina'' - "sheath" + ''spasmus'' - "spasm")

Many terms have been used synonymously to refer to this condition, some inappropriately. The term "anismus" has been criticised as it implies a [[psychogenic disease|psychogenic]] cause.<ref name="Dyssynergic Defecation and Biofeedback Therapy">{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=Satish S.C.|title=Dyssynergic Defecation and Biofeedback Therapy|journal=Gastroenterology Clinics of North America|date=31 August 2008|volume=37|issue=3|pages=569–586|doi=10.1016/j.gtc.2008.06.011|pmid=18793997|pmc=2575098}}</ref> As stated in the Rome II criteria, the term "dyssynergic defecation" is preferred to "pelvic floor dyssynergia" because many patients with dyssynergic defecation do not report sexual or urinary symptoms,<ref name="Functional anorectal disorders.">{{cite journal|last=Bharucha|first=AE|coauthors=Wald, A; Enck, P; Rao, S|title=Functional anorectal disorders|journal=Gastroenterology|date=2006 Apr|volume=130|issue=5|pages=1510–8|pmid=16678564|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.11.064}}</ref> meaning that only the defecation mechanism is affected.

==Classification==
Anismus is classified as a functional defecation disorder. It is also a type of [[Bowel obstruction#Outlet obstruction|rectal outlet obstruction]] (a functional outlet obstruction). Where anismus causes constipation, it is an example of [[functional constipation]]. Some authors describe an "[[obstructed defecation syndrome]]", of which anismus is a cause.<ref name="Obstructed Defaecation Web" /> 

The [[Rome process|Rome classification]] subdivides functional defecation disorders into 3 types,<ref name="Functional anorectal disorders." /> however the symptoms the patient experiences are identical.<ref name="Investigation of the utility of colorectal function tests and Rome II criteria in dyssynergic defecation (Anismus).">{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=SS|coauthors=Mudipalli, RS; Stessman, M; Zimmerman, B|title=Investigation of the utility of colorectal function tests and Rome II criteria in dyssynergic defecation (Anismus)|journal=Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society|date=2004 Oct|volume=16|issue=5|pages=589–96|pmid=15500515|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2982.2004.00526.x}}</ref> 
*Type I:  paradoxical paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted defecation
*Type II:  inadequate propulsive forces during attempted defecation (inadequate defecatory propulsion)
*Type III:  impaired relaxation with adequate propulsion

It can be seen from the above classification that many of the terms that have been used interchangeably with anismus are inappropriately specific and neglect the concept of impaired propulsion. Similarly, some of the definitions that have been offered are also too restrictive.

Symptoms include:

==Etiology==
[[File:Stylized depiction of action of puborectalis sling.png|547px|thumb|right|Stylized diagram showing action of the puborectalis sling, and the formation of the anorectal angle. A-puborectalis, B-rectum, C-level of anorectal ring and anorectal angle, D-anal canal, E-anal verge, F-representation of internal and external anal sphincters, G-coccyx & sacrum, H-pubic symphysis, I-Ischium, J-pubic bone.]]

To understand the etiology of anismus, an understanding of normal colorectal anatomy and physiology, including the normal defecation mechanism, is helpful. The relevant anatomy includes: the [[rectum]], the [[anal canal]] and the muscles of the [[pelvic floor]], especially [[puborectalis]] and the [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external anal sphincter]].

The [[rectum]] is a section of bowel situated just above the anal canal and distal to the [[sigmoid colon]]. It is believed to act as a reservoir to store stool until it fills past a certain volume, at which time the defecation reflexes are stimulated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shafik|first=A|coauthors=Mostafa, RM; Shafik, I; Ei-Sibai, O; Shafik, AA|title=Functional activity of the rectum: A conduit organ or a storage organ or both?|journal=World journal of gastroenterology : WJG|date=2006-07-28|volume=12|issue=28|pages=4549–52|pmid=16874870}}</ref> In healthy individuals, defecation can be temporarily delayed until it is socially acceptable to [[defecation|defecate]]. In continent individuals, the rectum is able to expand to a degree to accommodate this function.

The [[anal canal]] is the short straight section of bowel between the rectum and the [[anus]]. It can be defined functionally as the distance between the anorectal ring and the end of the [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal anal sphincter]]. The internal anal sphincter forms the walls of the anal canal. The [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal anal sphincter]] is not under voluntary control, and in normal persons it is contracted at all times except when there is a need to defecate. This means that the [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal anal sphincter]] contributes more to the resting tone of the anal canal than the [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external anal sphincter]]. The internal sphincter is responsible for creating a watertight seal, and therefore provides continence of liquid stool elements.

[[Puborectalis]] is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor. It is [[skeletal muscle]], meaning it is under voluntary control. The puborectalis originates on the posterior aspect of the [[pubic bone]], and runs backwards, looping around the bowel.

The point at which the rectum joins the anal canal is known as the anorectal ring, which is at the level that the [[puborectalis]] muscle loops around the bowel from in front. This arrangement means that when puborectalis is contracted, it pulls the junction of the rectum and the anal canal forwards, creating an angle in the bowel called the anorectal angle. This angle prevents the movement of stool stored in the rectum moving into the anal canal. It is thought to be responsible for gross continence of solid stool. Some believe the anorectal angle is one of the most important contributors to continence.<ref name="Altomare 51–4">{{cite journal|last=Altomare|first=DF|coauthors=Rinaldi, M; Veglia, A; Guglielmi, A; Sallustio, PL; Tripoli, G|title=Contribution of posture to the maintenance of anal continence.|journal=International journal of colorectal disease|date=2001 Feb|volume=16|issue=1|pages=51–4|pmid=11317698}}</ref> 

Conversely, relaxation of the [[puborectalis]] reduces the pull on the junction of the [[rectum]] and the [[anal canal]],
causing the anorectal angle to straighten out. A [[Human defecation posture|squatting posture]] is also known to straighten the anorectal angle, meaning that less effort is required to defecate when in this position.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sikirov|first=D|title=Comparison of straining during defecation in three positions: results and implications for human health.|journal=Digestive diseases and sciences|date=2003 Jul|volume=48|issue=7|pages=1201–5|pmid=12870773}}</ref>  

Distension of the rectum normally causes the [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal anal sphincter]] to relax (Rectoanal inhibitory response, RAIR) and the [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external anal sphincter]] initially to contract (rectoanal excitatory reflex, RAER). The relaxation of the [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal anal sphincter]] is an involuntary response. The [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external anal sphincter]], by contrast, is made up of skeletal (or striated muscle) and is therefore under voluntary control. It is able to contract vigorously for a short time. Contraction of the external sphincter can defer defecation for a time by pushing stool from the anal canal back into the rectum. 

Once the voluntary signal to defecate is sent back from the brain, the abdominal muscles contract (straining) causing the intra-abdominal pressure to increase. the pelvic floor is lowered causing the ano rectal angle to straighten out from ~90<sup>o</sup> to <15<sup>o</sup> and the external anal sphincter relaxes. The rectum now contracts and shortens in [[peristalsis|peristaltic waves]], thus forcing fecal material out of the rectum, through the anal canal and out of the anus. The internal and external anal sphincters along with the puborectalis muscle allow the feces to be passed by pulling the anus up over the exiting feces in shortening and contracting actions.

In patients with anismus, the puborectalis and the external anal sphincter muscles fail to relax, with resultant failure of the anorectal angle to straighten out and facilitate evacuation of feces from the rectum. These muscles may even contract when they should relax (paradoxical contraction), and this not only fails to straighten out the anorectal angle, but causes it to become more acute and offer greater obstruction to evacuation. 

As these muscles are under voluntary control, the failure of muscular relaxation or paradoxical contraction that is characteristic of anismus can be thought of as either maladaptive behavior or a loss of voluntary control of these muscles. Others claim that puborectalis can become [[hypertrophy|hypertrophied]] (enlarged) or [[fibrosed|fibrosis]] (replacement of muscle tissue with a more fibrous tissue), which reduces voluntary control over the muscle.

Anismus could be thought of as the patient "forgetting" how to push correctly, i.e. straining against a contracted pelvic floor, instead of increasing abdominal cavity pressures and lowering pelvic cavity pressures. It may be that this scenario develops as a result of stress. For example, one study reported that animus was strongly associated with sexual abuse in women.<ref name="Anismus as a marker of sexual abuse. Consequences of abuse on anorectal motility.">{{cite journal|last=Leroi|first=AM|coauthors=Berkelmans, I; Denis, P; Hémond, M; Devroede, G|title=Anismus as a marker of sexual abuse. Consequences of abuse on anorectal motility.|journal=Digestive diseases and sciences|date=1995 Jul|volume=40|issue=7|pages=1411–6|pmid=7628260}}</ref> One paper stated that events such as pregnancy, childbirth, gynaecological descent or neurogenic disturbances of the brain-bowel axis could lead to a "functional [[obstructed defecation syndrome]]" (including anismus).<ref name="[Functional obstructed defecation syndrome].">{{cite journal|last=Kairaluoma|first=MV|title=[Functional obstructed defecation syndrome].|journal=Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja|year=2009|volume=125|issue=2|pages=221–5|pmid=19341037}}</ref> Anismus may develop in persons with [[extrapyramidal motor disturbance]] due to [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite pmid|17131231}}</ref>  This represents a type of [[focal dystonia]].<ref>{{cite pmid|3221217}}</ref> Anismus may also occur with [[anorectal malformation]], [[rectocele]],<ref>{{cite pmid|12501052}}</ref> [[rectal prolapse]]<ref name=PMID9708010>{{cite pmid|9708010}}</ref> and [[rectal ulcer]].<ref name=PMID9708010/> 

In many cases however, the underlying pathophysiology in patients presenting with obstructed defecation cannot be determined.<ref name="Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.">{{cite journal|last=Lubowski|first=DZ|coauthors=King, DW|title=Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.|journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery|date=1995 Feb|volume=65|issue=2|pages=87–92|pmid=7857236}}</ref>

Some authors have commented that the "puborectalis paradox" and "spastic pelvic floor" concepts have no objective data to support their validity. They state that "new evidence showing that defecation is an integrated process of colonic and rectal emptying suggests that anismus may be much more complex than a simple disorder of the pelvic floor muscles." <ref name="Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.">{{cite journal|last=Lubowski|first=DZ|coauthors=King, DW|title=Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.|journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery|date=1995 Feb|volume=65|issue=2|pages=87–92|pmid=7857236}}</ref>

===Complications===

Persistent failure to fully evacuate stool may lead to retention of a mass of stool in the rectum (fecal loading), which can become hardened, forming a [[fecal impaction]] or even [[fecolith]]s.

Liquid stool elements may leak around the retained fecal mass, which may lead to paradoxical diarrhoea and/or fecal leakage (usually known as [[encopresis]] in children and [[fecal leakage]] in adults).<ref name="Clinical significance of anismus in encopresis.">{{cite journal|last=Catto-Smith|first=AG|coauthors=Nolan, TM; Coffey, CM|title=Clinical significance of anismus in encopresis|journal=Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology|date=1998 Sep|volume=13|issue=9|pages=955–60|pmid=9794197|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1746.1998.tb00768.x}}</ref><ref name="Fecal seepage and soiling: a problem of rectal sensation.">{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=BA|coauthors=Timmcke, AE; Gathright JB, Jr; Hicks, TC; Opelka, FG; Beck, DE|title=Fecal seepage and soiling: a problem of rectal sensation.|journal=Diseases of the colon and rectum|date=1995 Jul|volume=38|issue=7|pages=746–8|pmid=7607037}}</ref><ref name="Investigation of the pathophysiology of fecal seepage.">{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=SS|coauthors=Ozturk, R; Stessman, M|title=Investigation of the pathophysiology of fecal seepage.|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=2004 Nov|volume=99|issue=11|pages=2204–9|pmid=15555003|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.40387.x}}</ref><ref name="Conservative treatment of patients with faecal soiling.">{{cite journal|last=van der Hagen|first=SJ|coauthors=Soeters, PB; Baeten, CG; van Gemert, WG|title=Conservative treatment of patients with faecal soiling.|journal=Techniques in coloproctology|date=2011 Sep|volume=15|issue=3|pages=291–5|pmid=21720889|doi=10.1007/s10151-011-0709-1|pmc=3155048}}</ref> 

When anismus occurs in the context of intractable [[encopresis]] (as it often does), resolution of anismus may be insufficient to resolve encopresis.<ref name="pmid9797593"/> For this reason, and because biofeedback training is invasive, expensive, and labor intensive, biofeedback training is not recommended for treatment of encopresis with anismus.

The walls of the rectum may become stretched, known as [[megarectum]].<ref name="[Megarectum and anismus: a cause of constipation].">{{cite journal|last=Real Martínez|first=Y|coauthors=Ibáñez Moya, M; Pérez Mota, A|title=[Megarectum and anismus: a cause of constipation]|journal=Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva|date=2007 Jun|volume=99|issue=6|pages=352–3|pmid=17883300}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The Rome classification diagnostic criteria for functional defecation disorders is as follows:<ref name="Functional anorectal disorders." /> 

#Patient must satisfy diagnostic criteria for '''[[functional constipation]]'''
#During repeated attempts to defecate must have '''at least 2''' of the following:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
:<li>Evidence of impaired evacuation, based on balloon expulsion test or imaging</li>
:<li>Inappropriate contraction of the pelvic floor muscles (ie, anal sphincter or puborectalis) or less than 20% relaxation of basal resting sphincter pressure by manometry, imaging, or electromyography</li>
:<li>Inadequate propulsive forces assessed by manometry or imaging</li>
</ol>

The diagnostic criteria for dyssynergic defecation is given as "inappropriate contraction of the pelvic floor
or less than 20% relaxation of basal resting sphincter pressure with adequate propulsive forces during attempted defecation." <ref name="Functional anorectal disorders." />

The diagnostic criteria for inadequate defecatory Propulsion is given as "inadequate propulsive forces with or without inappropriate contraction or less than 20% relaxation of the anal sphincter during attempted defecation." <ref name="Functional anorectal disorders." /> 

The Rome criteria recommend that anorectal testing is not usually indicated in patients with symptoms of until patients have failed conservative
treatment (e.g., increased dietary fiber and liquids; elimination
of medications with constipating side effects
whenever possible).

Various investigations have been recommended in the diagnosis of anisumus.

===Digital rectal examination===

==Treatment==
Initial steps to alleviate anismus include dietary adjustments and simple adjustments when attempting to defecate. Supplementation with a [[laxative#Bulk producing agent|bulking agent]] such as [[psyllium seed husk|psyllium]] 3500&nbsp;mg per day will make stool more bulky, which decreases the effort required to evacuate.<ref name="The ASCRS textbook of colon and rectal surgery" /> Similarly, exercise and adequate hydration may help to optimise [[Bristol stool chart|stool form]]. The anorectal angle has been shown to flatten out when in a squatting position, and is thus recommended for patients with functional outlet obstruction like anismus.<ref name="Altomare 51–4"/> If the patient is unable to assume a squatting postures due to mobility issues, a low stool can be used to raise the feet when sitting, which effectively achieves a similar position.

Treatments for anismus include biofeedback retraining, botox injections, and surgical resection. Anismus sometimes occurs together with other conditions that limit (see [[contraindication]]) the choice of treatments.  Thus, thorough evaluation is recommended prior to treatment.<ref name=PMID97080109>{{cite pmid|708010}}</ref>

Injections of [[botox|botulin toxin type-A]] into the [[puborectalis muscle]] are very effective in the short term, and somewhat effective in the long term.<ref>{{cite pmid|19039596}}; {{cite pmid|18719924}}</ref> Injections may be helpful when used together with biofeedback training.<ref>{{cite pmid|8831524}}</ref><ref name="Comparative study between biofeedback retraining and botulinum neurotoxin in the treatment of anismus patients.">{{cite journal|last=Farid|first=M|coauthors=El Monem, HA; Omar, W; El Nakeeb, A; Fikry, A; Youssef, T; Yousef, M; Ghazy, H; Fouda, E; El Metwally, T; Khafagy, W; Ahmed, S; El Awady, S; Morshed, M; El Lithy, R|title=Comparative study between biofeedback retraining and botulinum neurotoxin in the treatment of anismus patients.|journal=International journal of colorectal disease|date=2009 Jan|volume=24|issue=1|pages=115–20|pmid=18719924|doi=10.1007/s00384-008-0567-0}}</ref> 

Historically, the standard treatment was [[Segmental resection|surgical resection]] of the puborectalis muscle, which sometimes resulted in fecal incontinence. Recently, partial resection (partial division) has been reported to be effective in some cases.<ref name="Comparative study between surgical and non-surgical treatment of anismus in patients with symptoms of obstructed defecation: a prospective randomized study.">{{cite journal|last=Faried|first=M|coauthors=El Nakeeb, A; Youssef, M; Omar, W; El Monem, HA|title=Comparative study between surgical and non-surgical treatment of anismus in patients with symptoms of obstructed defecation: a prospective randomized study.|journal=Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract|date=2010 Aug|volume=14|issue=8|pages=1235–43|pmid=20499203|doi=10.1007/s11605-010-1229-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19039596}}</ref>
