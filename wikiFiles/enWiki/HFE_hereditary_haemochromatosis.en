== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Iron metabolism.svg|thumb|400px|The normal distribution of body iron stores]]

Since the regulation of [[iron]] metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the [[HFE gene]], where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of [[transferrin]], which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low [[ferritin]] stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE [[genotype]]. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of [[hepcidin]] in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.<ref name="pmid18249176">{{cite journal |author=Vujić Spasić M, Kiss J, Herrmann T, ''et al'' |title=Hfe acts in hepatocytes to prevent hemochromatosis |journal=Cell Metab. |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=173–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18249176 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.11.014}}</ref>

People with abnormal iron regulatory genes do not reduce their absorption of iron in response to increased iron levels in the body.  Thus the iron stores of the body increase.  As they increase, the iron which is initially stored as ferritin is deposited in organs as [[haemosiderin]] and this is [[toxic]] to [[biological tissue|tissue]], probably at least partially by inducing [[oxidative stress]].<ref name=Shizukuda_2007>{{cite journal |author=Shizukuda Y, Bolan C, Nguyen T, Botello G, Tripodi D, Yau Y, Waclawiw M, Leitman S, Rosing D |title=Oxidative stress in asymptomatic subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis |journal=Am J Hematol |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=249–50 |year=2007 |pmid=16955456 |doi=10.1002/ajh.20743}}</ref>  Iron is a [[pro-oxidant]].   Thus, haemochromatosis shares common symptomology (e.g., cirrhosis and dyskinetic symptoms) with other "pro-oxidant" diseases such as [[Wilson's disease]], chronic [[manganese poisoning]], and hyperuricaemic syndrome in [[Dalmatian dogs]].   The latter also experience "bronzing".

==Terminology==
The term "haemochromatosis" is used by many different sources in many different ways.

It is often used to imply an association with the [[HFE (gene)|HFE gene]]. For many years, HFE was the only known gene associated with haemochromatosis, and the term "hereditary haemochromatosis" was used to describe haemochromatosis type 1. However, it is now known that there are many different genetic associations with this condition. The older the text, or the more general the audience, the more likely that HFE is implied.

The term "haemochromatosis" has also been in contexts where there had not been a known genetic association for the iron accumulation. However, it should be noted that in some cases, the understanding of a condition that was considered due to behaviour can be refined to accommodate new known genetic associations, as in [[African iron overload]].

== History ==
The disease was first described in 1865 by [[Armand Trousseau]] in a report on [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] in patients presenting with a bronze pigmentation of their skin.<ref name=Trousseau_1865>{{cite journal | author = Trousseau A| title = Glycosurie, diabète sucré | journal = Clinique médicale de l'Hôtel-Dieu de Paris | year = 1865 | volume = 2| pages = 663–98 | url= }}</ref> Trousseau did not associate [[diabetes]] with [[iron]] accumulation; the recognition that infiltration of the pancreas with iron might disrupt endocrine function resulting in diabetes was made by [[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen]] in 1890.<ref>{{cite journal | author = von Recklinghausen FD | title = Hämochromatose | journal = Tageblatt der Naturforschenden Versammlung 1889 | year = 1890 | pages = 324 | url= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1174.html Biography of Daniel von Recklinghausen]</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Haemochromatosis is [[wikt:protean|protean]] in its manifestations, ''i.e.'', often presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of other diagnoses that affect specific organ systems. Many of the signs and symptoms below are uncommon and most patients with the hereditary form of haemochromatosis do not show any overt signs of disease nor do they suffer premature morbidity.<ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/hemochromatosis/index.htm Hemochromatosis-Diagnosis] National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</ref>

The classic triad of cirrhosis, bronze skin and diabetes is not as common anymore because of earlier diagnosis.<ref name="pmid15175440"/>

Males are usually diagnosed after their forties and fifties, and women several decades later, owing to regular iron loss through [[menstruation]] (which ceases in [[menopause]]). The severity of clinical disease in the hereditary form varies considerably.  There is evidence suggesting that hereditary haemochromatosis patients affected with other liver ailments such as hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease suffer worse liver disease than those with either condition alone.  There are also juvenile forms of hereditary haemochromatosis that present in childhood with the same consequences of iron overload.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of haemochromatosis is often made following the incidental finding on routine blood screening of elevated serum liver enzymes or elevation of the transferrin saturation. Arthropathy with stiff joints, diabetes, or fatigue, may be the presenting complaint.<ref name=Mayo>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Hemochromatosis: Tests and diagnosis |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref>

===Blood tests===
[[Serum transferrin]] and [[transferrin saturation]] are commonly used as screening for haemochromatosis. [[Transferrin]] binds iron and is responsible for iron transport in the blood.<ref>[http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/iron_transport.html Transferrin and Iron Transport Physiology]</ref> Measuring transferrin provides a crude measure of iron stores in the body. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45% (or 35% in premenopausal women) are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of haemochromatosis.<ref name="pmid15175440">{{cite journal |author=Pietrangelo A |title=Hereditary hemochromatosis—a new look at an old disease |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=350 |issue=23 |pages=2383–97 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15175440 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra031573 |url=}}</ref> Transferrin saturation greater than 62% is suggestive of homozygosity for mutations in the [[HFE gene]].<ref name="pmid7102818">{{cite journal |author=Dadone MM, Kushner JP, Edwards CQ, Bishop DT, Skolnick MH |title=Hereditary hemochromatosis.

'''Serum Ferritin''': [[Ferritin]], a protein synthesized by the liver is the primary form of iron storage within cells and tissues.  Measuring ferritin provides another crude estimate of whole body iron stores though many conditions, particularly inflammation (but also chronic alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and others), can elevate serum ferritin - which can account for up to 90% of cases where elevated levels are observed.<ref name="austpre01" /> Normal values for males are 12–300&nbsp;ng/ml (nanograms per millilitre) and for female, 12–150&nbsp;ng/ml.<ref name=Mayo/><ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003490|Ferritin Test}} Measuring iron in the body</ref> Serum ferritin in excess of 1000 nanograms per millilitre of blood is almost always attributable to haemochromatosis.

Other blood tests routinely performed: [[blood count]], [[renal function]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[electrolyte]]s, [[glucose]] (and/or an [[oral glucose tolerance test]] (OGTT)).

===Liver biopsy===
[[File:Hemochromatosis liver iron prussian blue.jpg|thumb|Iron accumulation demonstrated by [[Prussian blue]] staining in a patient with homozygous genetic haemochromatosis (microscopy, 10x magnified). Parts of normal pink tissue are scarcely present.]]
[[Liver biopsy|Liver biopsies]] involve taking a sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then quantified and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially [[cirrhosis]], measured microscopically. Formerly, this was the only way to confirm a diagnosis of haemochromatosis but measures of transferrin and ferritin along with a history are considered adequate in determining the presence of the malady. Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding and infection. Now, when a history and measures of transferrin or ferritin point to haemochromatosis, it is debatable whether a liver biopsy is still necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron.<ref name=Mayo/>

===MRI===
FerriScan [http://www.ferriscan.com/] is an MRI-based test to non-invasively and accurately measure liver iron concentrations.<ref name="pmid15256427">{{cite journal |author=St Pierre |title=Non-invasive measurement and imaging of liver iron concentrations using proton magnetic resonance |journal=Blood. |volume=105 |pages=855–61 |year=2005 |pmid=15256427 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-01-0177 |url= |issue=2 |last2=Clark |first2=PR |last3=Chua-Anusorn |first3=W |last4=Fleming |first4=AJ |last5=Jeffrey |first5=GP |last6=Olynyk |first6=JK |last7=Pootrakul |first7=P |last8=Robins |first8=E |last9=Lindeman |first9=R}}</ref> It is safer and generally cheaper to perform than liver biopsy; does not suffer from problems with sampling variability; and can be used more frequently than performing liver biopsies. FerriScan has regulatory approval in the USA, Canada, Europe and Australasia. A FerriScan takes about 10 minutes to perform and doesn't require any contrast agents. It can be quickly and easily established on most 1.5 T MRI scanners.

===Other imaging===
Clinically the disease may be silent, but characteristic radiological features may point to the diagnosis.  The increased iron stores in the organs involved, especially in the liver and pancreas, result in characteristic findings on unenhanced [[Computed axial tomography|CT]] and a decreased signal intensity in [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scans]]. Haemochromatosis [[arthropathy]] includes degenerative [[osteoarthritis]] and [[Pseudogout|chondrocalcinosis]]. The distribution of the [[arthropathy]] is distinctive, but not unique, frequently affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}  The [[arthropathy]] can therefore be an early clue as to the diagnosis of haemochromatosis.

===Functional testing===
Based on the history, the [[physician|doctor]] might consider specific tests to monitor organ dysfunction, such as an [[echocardiogram]] for [[heart failure]], or blood glucose monitoring for patients with haemochromatosis [[diabetes]].

===Differential diagnosis===
There exist other causes of excess iron accumulation, which have to be considered before haemochromatosis is diagnosed.
* '''[[African iron overload]]''', formerly known as Bantu siderosis, was first observed among people of [[African]] descent in [[Southern Africa]]. Originally, this was blamed on [[galvanisation|ungalvanised]] barrels used to store home-made beer, which led to increased oxidation and increased iron levels in the [[beer]]. Further investigation has shown that only some people drinking this sort of beer get an iron overload syndrome, and that a similar syndrome occurred in people of [[African]] descent who have had no contact with this kind of [[beer]] (''e.g.,'' [[African Americans]]). This led investigators to the discovery of a gene [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in the gene for [[ferroportin]] which predisposes some people of African descent to iron overload.<ref name=Gordeuk_2003>{{cite journal |author=Gordeuk V, Caleffi A, Corradini E, Ferrara F, Jones R, Castro O, Onyekwere O, Kittles R, Pignatti E, Montosi G, Garuti C, Gangaidzo I, Gomo Z, Moyo V, Rouault T, MacPhail P, Pietrangelo A |title=Iron overload in Africans and African-Americans and a common mutation in the SCL40A1 (ferroportin 1) gene |journal=Blood Cells Mol Dis |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=299–304 |year=2003 |pmid=14636642 |doi=10.1016/S1079-9796(03)00164-5}}</ref>
* '''[[Transfusion hemosiderosis|Transfusion haemosiderosis]]''' is the accumulation of iron, mainly in the [[liver]], in patients who receive frequent [[blood transfusion]]s (such as those with [[thalassemia|thalassaemia]]).
* '''Dyserythropoeisis''', also known as [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], is a disorder in the production of red blood cells. This leads to increased iron recycling from the [[bone marrow]] and accumulation in the liver.

==End-organ damage==
Iron is stored in the liver, the pancreas and the heart. Long term effects of haemochromatosis on these organs can be very serious, even fatal when untreated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=6 |title=Hemochromatosis: Complications |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=}}</ref> For example, similar to [[alcoholism]], haemochromatosis can cause [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]]. The liver is a primary storage area for iron and will naturally accumulate excess iron. Over time the liver is likely to be damaged by iron overload. Cirrhosis itself may lead to additional and more serious complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the [[esophagus]] ([[esophageal varices]]) and [[stomach]] ([[gastric varices]]) and severe fluid retention in the [[abdomen]] ([[ascites]]). Toxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning. This can lead to confusion or even [[coma]] (hepatic [[encephalopathy]]).

'''[[Liver]] [[cancer]]''': Cirrhosis and haemochromatosis together will increase the risk of liver cancer. (Nearly one-third of people with haemochromatosis and cirrhosis eventually develop liver cancer.)

'''[[Diabetes]]''': The [[pancreas]] which also stores iron is very important in the body’s mechanisms for sugar [[metabolism]]. Diabetes affects the way the body uses blood sugar ([[glucose]]). Diabetes is in turn the leading cause of new blindness in adults and may be involved in [[kidney failure]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].

'''[[Congestive heart failure]]''': If excess iron in the heart interferes with the its ability to circulate enough blood, a number of problems can occur including death. The condition may be reversible when haemochromatosis is treated and excess iron stores reduced.

'''[[Heart]] [[arrhythmias]]''': Arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythms can cause heart palpitations, chest pain and light-headedness and are occasionally life threatening. This condition can often be reversed with treatment for haemochromatosis.

'''[[Pigment]] changes''': Bronze or grey coloration of the skin is caused primarily by increased melanin deposition, with iron deposition playing a lesser role.<ref name=Pedrup_1964>{{cite journal |author=Pedrup A, Poulsen H |title=Hemochromatosis and Vitiligo |journal=Archives of Dermatology |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=34–37 |year=1964 |pmid=14149720 |doi=10.1001/archderm.1964.01600010040010}}</ref>

== Treatment ==

===Phlebotomy===
Early diagnosis is important because the late effects of iron accumulation can be wholly prevented by periodic [[Venipuncture|phlebotomies]] (by venesection) comparable in volume to [[blood donation]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=7 |title=Hemochromatosis: Treatments and drugs |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=}}</ref> Treatment is initiated when [[ferritin]] levels reach 300 nanograms per millilitre (or 200 in nonpregnant [[premenopausal]] women).

Every bag of blood (450–500 [[millilitre|ml]]) contains 200–250 [[milligram]]s of iron. Phlebotomy (or [[bloodletting]]) is usually done at a weekly interval until [[ferritin]] levels are less than 20 milligrams per litre. After that, 1–6 donations per year are usually needed to maintain iron balance.

===Desferrioxamine mesilate===
Where venesection is not possible, long-term administration of desferrioxamine mesilate is useful. Desferrioxamine is an iron-chelating compound, and excretion induced by desferrioxamine is enhanced by administration of Vitamin C. It cannot be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding due to risk of defects in the child.

===Treatment of organ damage===
* Treatment of organ damage ([[heart failure]] with [[diuretic]]s and [[ACE inhibitor]] therapy).

===Diet===
* Limiting intake of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[vitamin C]] (increases iron absorption in the gut), red [[meat]] (high in [[iron]]) and potential causes of food poisoning ([[shellfish]], [[seafood]]).
* Increasing intake of substances that inhibit iron absorption, such as high-[[tannin]] [[tea]], [[calcium]], and foods containing [[Oxalic acid|oxalic]] and [[phytic acid]]s (such as [[collard greens]], which must be consumed at the same time as the iron-containing foods in order to be effective).<ref>http://dynaweb.ebscohost.com/Detail.aspx?id=116469&sid=14aa79e5-a881-407c-94e7-339b81c4cd18@sessionmgr3 accessed October 15, 2008.</ref>

== Screening ==
Standard diagnostic measures for haemochromatosis, [[transferrin saturation]] and [[ferritin]] tests, are not a part of routine medical testing.  [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] for haemochromatosis is recommended if the patient has a parent, child or sibling with the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Summaries for patients. Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: recommendations from the American College of Physicians |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=143 |issue=7 |pages=I46 |year=2005 |pmid=16204158 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/7/I-46}}</ref>

Routine screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis is generally not done. Mass genetic screening has been evaluated by the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF), among other groups.  The USPSTF recommended against genetic screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis because the likelihood of discovering an undiagnosed patient with clinically relevant iron overload is less than 1 in 1,000.  Although there is strong evidence that treatment of iron overload can save lives in patients with transfusional iron overload, no clinical study has shown that for asymptomatic carriers of hereditary haemochromatosis treatment with venesection  ([[phlebotomy]]) provides any clinical benefit.<ref name="pmid16880462">{{cite journal |author= |title=Screening for haemochromatosis: recommendation statement |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=145 |issue=3 |pages=204–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16880462 |doi= |author1= U.S. Preventive Services Task Force}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspshemoch.htm Screening for Hemochromatosis] U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2006).

Retrieved 18 March 2007</ref> Recently, it has been suggested that patients be screened for iron overload using serum ferritin as a marker: If serum ferritin exceeds 1000&nbsp;ng/mL, iron overload is very likely the cause.

== Epidemiology ==
Haemochromatosis is one of the most common heritable genetic conditions in people of northern European extraction with a prevalence of 1 in 200. The disease has a variable penetration and about 1 in 10 people of this demographic carry a mutation in one of the [[genes]] regulating [[iron]] [[metabolism]], the most common allele being the C282Y allele in the [[HFE (gene)|''HFE'' gene]].<ref name="pmid18762941">{{cite journal |author=Mendes AI, Ferro A, Martins R, ''et al.'' |title=Non-classical hereditary hemochromatosis in Portugal: novel mutations identified in iron metabolism-related genes |journal=Ann.

A study of 3,011 unrelated white Australians found that 14% were [[heterozygous]] carriers of an HFE mutation, 0.5% were [[homozygous]] for an ''HFE'' mutation, and only 0.25% of the study population had clinically relevant iron overload.  Most patients who are [[homozygous]] for HFE mutations will not manifest clinically relevant haemochromatosis (see Genetics below).<ref name=Olynwk_1999>{{cite journal |author=Olynyk J, Cullen D, Aquilia S, Rossi E, Summerville L, Powell L |title=A population-based study of the clinical expression of the hemochromatosis gene |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=341 |issue=10 |pages=718–24 |year=1999 |pmid=10471457 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199909023411002}}</ref> Other populations have a lower prevalence of both the genetic mutation and the clinical disease.

[[Genetics|Genetic]] studies suggest the original haemochromatosis [[mutation]] arose in a single person, possibly of [[Celt]]ic ethnicity, who lived 60–70 generations ago.<ref>www.scripps.edu/bcmd/pdfarea/issue_20_98/lucotte.pdf</ref> At that time when dietary iron may have been scarcer than today, the presence of the [[mutant allele]] may have provided an [[evolution]]ary or [[natural selection]] [[reproductive advantage]] by maintaining higher [[iron]] levels in the blood.

The regulation of dietary iron absorption is complex and our understanding is incomplete. One of the better characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is [[HFE gene|HFE]]<ref name="pmid18752323">{{cite journal |author=Olynyk JK, Trinder D, Ramm GA, Britton RS, Bacon BR |title=Hereditary hemochromatosis in the post-HFE era |journal=Hepatology |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=991–1001 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18752323 |doi=10.1002/hep.22507 |pmc=2548289 }}</ref> on [[chromosome 6]] which codes for a protein that participates in the regulation of iron absorption.  The [[HFE gene]] has two common alleles, C282Y and H63D.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=3 |title=Hemochromatosis: Causes |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=}}</ref>  The C282Y allele is a [[Transition (genetics)|transition]] [[point mutation]] from [[guanine]] to [[adenine]] at nucleotide 845 in the HFE gene, resulting in a [[missense mutation]] that replaces the [[cysteine]] residue at position 282 with a [[tyrosine]] amino acid.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Nature Genetics |title=A novel MHC class I-like gene is mutated in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=399–408 |year=1996 |pmid=8696333 |doi=10.1038/ng0896-399 |url= |author=Feder JN, Gnirke A, Thomas W, et al.}}</ref>  Heterozygotes for either allele do not manifest clinical iron overload but may display an increased iron uptake. [[Mutation]]s of the ''HFE'' [[gene]] account for 90% of the cases of non-transfusional iron overload.  This gene is closely [[genetic linkage|linked]] to the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA-A3]] [[Locus (genetics)|locus]].  [[Homozygosity]] for the C282Y [[mutation]] is the most common genotype responsible for clinical iron accumulation, though [[heterozygosity]] for C282Y/H63D mutations, so-called [[compound heterozygotes]], results in clinically evident iron overload.  There is considerable debate regarding the [[penetrance]]—the probability of clinical expression of the trait given the genotype—is for clinical disease in HHC homozygotes.  Most, if not all, males homozygous for HFE C282Y will show manifestations of liver dysfunction such as elevated liver-specific enzymes such as serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) by late middle age.  Homozygous females can delay the onset of iron accumulation because of iron loss through menstruation.  Each patient with the susceptible genotype accumulates iron at different rates depending on iron intake, the exact nature of the mutation and the presence of other insults to the liver such as alcohol and viral disease.  As such the degree to which the liver and other organs is affected, expressivity, is highly variable and is dependent on such these other factors and co-morbidities as well as age at which they are studied for manifestations of disease.<ref name=Olynwk_1999/> Penetrance differs between different populations.
