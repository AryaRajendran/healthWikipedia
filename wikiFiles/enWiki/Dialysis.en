In medicine '''dialysis''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] '''dialusis''','''"διάλυσις"''', meaning ''dissolution'', '''dia''', meaning ''through'', and '''lysis''', meaning ''loosening or splitting'') is a process for removing waste and excess water from the [[blood]], and is used primarily as an [[renal replacement therapy|artificial replacement]] for lost [[renal function|kidney function]] in people with [[renal failure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dialysis|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm#1whatis}}</ref>  Dialysis may be used for those with an acute disturbance in kidney function ([[acute kidney injury]], previously acute renal failure), or progressive but chronically worsening kidney function–a state known as [[chronic kidney disease]] stage 5 (previously chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease). The latter form may develop over months or years, but in contrast to acute kidney injury is not usually reversible, and dialysis is regarded as a "holding measure" until a [[renal transplant]] can be performed, or sometimes as the only supportive measure in those for whom a transplant would be inappropriate.<ref name=Pendse>Pendse S, Singh A, Zawada E.

The [[kidney]]s have important roles in maintaining health. When healthy, the kidneys maintain the body's internal equilibrium  of water and minerals (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfate). The acidic [[metabolism]] end-products that the body cannot get rid of via respiration are also excreted through the kidneys. The kidneys also function as a part of the [[endocrine system]], producing [[erythropoietin]] and [[1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol|calcitriol]]. Erythropoietin is involved in the production of red blood cells and calcitriol plays a role in bone formation.<ref>Brundage D. ''Renal Disorders''. St. Louis, MO: Mosby; 1992</ref> Dialysis is an imperfect treatment to replace kidney function because it does not correct the compromised endocrine functions of the kidney. Dialysis treatments replace some of these functions through [[diffusion]] (waste removal) and [[ultrafiltration]] (fluid removal).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidneyatlas.org/book5/adk5-01.ccc.QXD.pdf |title=Atlas of Diseases of the Kidney, Volume 5, Principles of Dialysis: Diffusion, Convection, and Dialysis Machines |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Dialysis - arm - 01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Arm showing tubes]]
Dr. [[Willem Kolff]], a Dutch physician, constructed the first working dialyzer in 1943 during the [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]].<ref name=NYT>''Willem Kolff, Doctor Who Invented Kidney and Heart Machines, Dies at 97''. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/health/13kolff.html?pagewanted=all; New York Times, 2009</ref> Due to the scarcity of available resources, Kolff had to improvise and build the initial machine using [[Casing (sausage)|sausage casings]], [[beverage can]]s, a [[washing machine]], and various other items that were available at the time. Over the following two years, Kolff used his machine to treat 16 patients suffering from [[acute kidney failure]], but the results were unsuccessful. Then, in 1945, a 67-year-old comatose woman regained consciousness following 11 hours of hemodialysis with the dialyzer, and lived for another seven years before dying of an unrelated condition. She was the first-ever patient successfully treated with dialysis.<ref name=NYT/>

==Principle==
[[File:Hemodialysismachine.jpg|thumb|A [[hemodialysis]] machine]]
Dialysis works on the principles of the [[diffusion]] of solutes and [[ultrafiltration]] of fluid across a [[semi-permeable membrane]]. Diffusion is a property of substances in water; substances in water tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.<ref name=Mosby>''Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, & Health Professions''. 7th ed. St. Louis, MO; Mosby: 2006</ref> Blood flows by one side of a semi-permeable membrane, and a dialysate, or special dialysis fluid, flows by the opposite side. A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells, large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys, when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the [[glomerulus]].<ref name=Mosby/>

The two main types of dialysis, [[hemodialysis]]  and [[peritoneal dialysis]], remove wastes and excess water from the blood in different ways.<ref name=Pendse/> Hemodialysis removes wastes and water by circulating blood outside the body through an external filter, called a [[dialyzer]], that contains a [[semipermeable membrane]]. The blood flows in one direction and the [[dialysate]] flows in the opposite.  The counter-current flow of the [[blood]] and dialysate maximizes the concentration gradient of solutes between the blood and dialysate, which helps to remove more urea and [[creatinine]] from the blood.  The concentrations of solutes (for example [[potassium]], [[phosphorus]], and urea) are undesirably high in the blood, but low or absent in the dialysis solution, and constant replacement of the dialysate ensures that the concentration of undesired solutes is kept low on this side of the membrane.  The dialysis solution has levels of minerals like [[potassium]] and [[calcium]] that are similar to their natural concentration in healthy blood. For another solute, [[bicarbonate]], dialysis solution level is set at a slightly higher level than in normal blood, to encourage diffusion of [[bicarbonate]] into the blood, to act as a pH buffer to neutralize the [[metabolic acidosis]] that is often present in these patients.  The levels of the components of dialysate are typically prescribed by a [[nephrologist]] according to the needs of the individual patient.

In [[peritoneal dialysis]], wastes and water are removed from the blood inside the body using the ''[[peritoneal membrane]]'' of the [[peritoneum]] as a natural semipermeable membrane. Wastes and excess water move from the blood, across the peritoneal membrane, and into a special dialysis solution, called dialysate, in the [[abdominal cavity]] which has a composition similar to the fluid portion of blood.

==Types==
There are three primary and two secondary types of dialysis: [[hemodialysis]] (primary), [[peritoneal dialysis]] (primary), [[hemofiltration]] (primary), [[hemodiafiltration]] (secondary), and [[intestinal dialysis]] (secondary).

===Hemodialysis===

{{main|Hemodialysis|Home hemodialysis}}
<!-- these should not be erased -->
In hemodialysis, the patient's blood is pumped through the blood compartment of a dialyzer, exposing it to a partially permeable membrane. The dialyzer is composed of thousands of tiny synthetic hollow fibers. The fiber wall acts as the semipermeable membrane. Blood flows through the fibers, dialysis solution flows around the outside of the fibers, and water and wastes move between these two solutions.<ref>Ahmad S, Misra M, Hoenich N, Daugirdas J. Hemodialysis Apparatus. In: ''Handbook of Dialysis''. 4th ed. New York, NY; 2008:59-78.</ref> The cleansed blood is then returned via the circuit back to the body. Ultrafiltration occurs by increasing the hydrostatic pressure across the dialyzer membrane.  This usually is done by applying a negative pressure to the dialysate compartment of the dialyzer.   This pressure gradient causes water and dissolved solutes to move from blood to dialysate, and allows the removal of several litres of excess fluid during a typical 3- to 5-hour treatment.
In the US, hemodialysis treatments are typically given in a dialysis center three times per week (due in the US to Medicare reimbursement rules); however, as of 2007 over 2,500 people in the US are dialyzing at home more frequently for various treatment lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usrds.org/2007/pdf/04_modalities_07.pdf |title=Usrds Treatment Modalities |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of dialyzing 5 to 7 times a week, for 6 to 8 hours. This type of hemodialysis is usually called "nocturnal daily hemodialysis", which a study has shown a significant improvement in both small and large molecular weight clearance and decrease the requirement of taking phosphate binders.<ref>Rocco MV.More frequent hemodialysis: back to the future? In: '' Advances in Chronic Kidney Disease''. Volume 14, issue 3; 2007:e1-9.</ref> These frequent long treatments are often done at home while sleeping, but home dialysis is a flexible modality and schedules can be changed day to day, week to week. In general, studies have shown that both increased treatment length and frequency are clinically beneficial.<ref>[http://www.homedialysis.org/learn/types/ Daily therapy study results compared]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

===Peritoneal dialysis===
[[Image:Peritoneal dialysis.gif|thumb|220px|Schematic diagram of peritoneal dialysis]]
{{main|Peritoneal dialysis}}
In peritoneal dialysis, a sterile solution containing glucose is run through a tube into the [[peritoneum|peritoneal cavity]], the [[abdomen|abdominal]] body cavity around the [[intestine]], where the peritoneal membrane acts as a partially permeable membrane.  The peritoneal membrane or peritoneum is a layer of tissue containing blood vessels that lines and surrounds the peritoneal, or abdominal, cavity and the internal abdominal organs (stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines).<ref>Blake P, Daugirdas J. Physiology of Peritoneal Dialysis. In: ''Handbook of Dialysis''. 4th ed. New York, NY; 2008:323-338</ref> The dialysate is left there for a period of time to absorb waste products, and then it is drained out through the tube and discarded. This cycle or "exchange" is normally repeated 4-5 times during the day, (sometimes more often overnight with an automated system). Each time the dialysate fills and empties from the abdomen is called one exchange. A dwell time means that the time of dialysate stay in patient's abdominal cavity—wastes, chemicals and extra fluid move from patient's blood to the dialysate across the peritoneum. A drain process is the process after the dwell time, the dialysate full with waste products and extra fluid is drained out of patient's blood.<ref>Kallenbach J.Z. In: ''Review of hemodialysis for nurses and dialysis personnel''. 7th ed. St. Louis, Missouri:Elsevier Mosby; 2005.</ref> Ultrafiltration occurs via [[osmosis]]; the dialysis solution used contains a high concentration of glucose, and the resulting osmotic pressure causes fluid to move from the blood into the dialysate.  As a result, more fluid is drained than was instilled. Peritoneal dialysis is less efficient than hemodialysis, but because it is carried out for a longer period of time the net effect in terms of removal of waste products and of salt and water are similar to hemodialysis.  Peritoneal dialysis is carried out at home by the patient.  Although support is helpful, it is not essential.  It does free patients from the routine of having to go to a dialysis clinic on a fixed schedule multiple times per week, and it can be done while travelling with a minimum of specialized equipment.

===Hemofiltration===
{{main|Hemofiltration}}
Hemofiltration is a similar treatment to hemodialysis, but it makes use of a different principle. The blood is pumped through a dialyzer or "hemofilter" as in dialysis, but no dialysate is used.  A pressure gradient is applied; as a result, water moves across the very permeable membrane rapidly, "dragging" along with it many dissolved substances, including ones with large molecular weights, which are not cleared as well by hemodialysis.  Salts and water lost from the blood during this process are replaced with a "substitution fluid" that is infused into the [[extracorporeal]] circuit during the treatment. [[Hemodiafiltration]] is the combining of hemodialysis and hemofiltration in one process.

===Hemodiafiltration===
Hemodialfiltration is a combination of hemodialysis and hemofiltration.

===Intestinal dialysis===
In intestinal dialysis, the diet is supplemented with soluble fibres such as [[gum arabic|acacia fibre]], which is digested by bacteria in the colon.  This bacterial growth increases the amount of nitrogen that is eliminated in fecal waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/15293039 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/17517814 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/17999333 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> An alternative approach utilizes the ingestion of 1 to 1.5 liters of non-absorbable solutions of [[polyethylene glycol]] or [[mannitol]] every fourth hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/1904625 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref>

==Starting indications==
The decision to initiate dialysis or hemofiltration in patients with [[renal failure]] depends on several factors. These can be divided into acute or chronic indications.

*Indications for dialysis in the patient with [[acute kidney injury]] are summarized with the vowel acronym of "AEIOU":<ref name="irwin">{{Cite book | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | isbn = 0-7817-9153-7, 9780781791533 | pages = 988–999 | last = Irwin | first = Richard S. | coauthors = James M. Rippe | title = Irwin and Rippe's intensive care medicine | year = 2008}}</ref>
*# [[Acidemia]] from [[metabolic acidosis]] in situations in which correction with sodium bicarbonate is impractical or may result in fluid overload
*# [[Electrolyte]] abnormality, such as severe [[hyperkalemia]], especially when combined with AKI
*# [[Substance intoxication|Intoxication]], that is, acute poisoning with a dialyzable substance. These substances can be represented by the mnemonic SLIME: [[salicylic acid]], [[lithium]], [[isopropanol]], Magnesium-containing laxatives, and [[ethylene glycol]]
*# [[Overload]] of fluid not expected to respond to treatment with diuretics
*# [[Uremia]] complications, such as [[pericarditis]], [[encephalopathy]], or [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].

*Chronic indications for dialysis:
*#Symptomatic renal failure
*#Low [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) ([[renal replacement therapy|RRT]] often recommended to commence at a GFR of less than 10-15 mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). In diabetics, dialysis is started earlier.
*#Difficulty in medically controlling fluid overload, serum potassium, and/or serum phosphorus when the GFR is very low
