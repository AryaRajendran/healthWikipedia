== History ==
The Cochrane Collaboration was founded in 1993 under the leadership of [[Iain Chalmers]]. It was developed in response to [[Archie Cochrane]]'s call for up-to-date, systematic reviews of all relevant randomized controlled trials of health care.
Cochrane's suggestion that the methods used to prepare and maintain reviews of controlled trials in pregnancy and childbirth should be applied more widely was taken up by the Research and Development Programme, initiated to support the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]]. Through the NHS R&D programme, led by the first Director of Research and Development Professor [[Michael Peckham]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peckham M |title=Research and development for the National Health Service |journal=Lancet |volume=338 |issue=8763 |pages=367–71 |year=1991 |month=August |pmid=1677710 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)90494-A |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(91)90494-A}}</ref> funds were provided to establish a 'Cochrane Centre', to collaborate with others, in the UK and elsewhere, to facilitate systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials across all areas of health care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/about-us/history |title=Chronology of the Cochrane Collaboration |publisher=Cochrane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> 

In October 1995, The Collaboration formed the [[Cochrane Consumer Network]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consumers.cochrane.org/healthcare-users-cochrane |title=About the Cochrane Consumer Network |publisher=cochrane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> to incorporate patient perspectives into the review process. Shortly thereafter, new 'plain language summaries' provided users with a jargon-free synopsis of each systematic review.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/handbook/44-plain-language-summary |title=Plain language summary |publisher=Cochrane.org |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>

The [[logo]] of the Cochrane Collaboration illustrates a meta analysis of data from seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing one health care treatment with a [[placebo]] in a [[forest plot]]. The diagram shows the results of a [[systematic review]] and meta analysis on inexpensive course of [[corticosteroid]] given to women about to give [[birth]] too early – the evidence on effectiveness that would have been revealed had the available RCTs been reviewed systematically a decade earlier. This treatment reduces the [[odds]] of the babies of such women dying from the complications of immaturity by 30–50%. Because no systematic review of these trials had been published until 1989, most obstetricians had not realised that the treatment was so effective and therefore many premature babies have probably suffered or died unnecessarily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/about-us/history/our-logo |title=Cochrane Collaboration Logo |publisher=Cochrane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>

== Reception ==
A 2004 editorial in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' noted that Cochrane reviews appear to be more updated and of better quality than other reviews and due to their standardized methodologies, was "the best single resource for methodologic research and for developing the science of meta-epidemiology."  Their work has also led to methodological improvements in the medical literature.  However, the editorial also noted areas for improvement remained, including adequately assessing potential harms from medical interventions and providing a more user friendly format as well as promoting international collaboration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grimshaw J |title=So what has the Cochrane Collaboration ever done for us? A report card on the first 10 years |journal=CMAJ |volume=171 |issue=7 |pages=747–9 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15451837 |pmc=517860 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1041255 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/171/7/747.full}}</ref>

A 2011 study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (JAMA), to disclose possible conflicts of interest in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses, reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that conflicts of interest in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed.  The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals; 15 from specialty medicine journals, and 3 from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author conflict of interest (COI) disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. 

The information regarding financial ties was, however, seldom publicly acknowledged in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors of the JAMA study concluded “without acknowledgement of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers’ understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised.”  Noting that  most assessment tools for meta-analysis do not include a domain for study funding source the authors state, “Currently, The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool includes an optional 'other sources of bias' domain, which meta-analysts could use to include information on COIs. We recommend that The Cochrane Collaboration consider formalizing the requirement to assess potential bias from COIs.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/news/blog/how-well-do-meta-analyses-disclose-conflicts-interests-underlying-research-studies |title=How Well Do Meta-Analyses Disclose Conflicts of Interests in Underlying Research Studies |publisher=Cochrane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>
