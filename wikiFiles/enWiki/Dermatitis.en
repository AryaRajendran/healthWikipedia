'''Dermatitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[Human skin|skin]] (i.e. [[rash]]).

==Etymology==
Dermatitis derives from Greek derma "skin" + -itis "inflammation".

==Terminology==
There are several different types of dermatitis. The different kinds usually have in common an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]] to specific [[allergen]]s. The term may describe [[eczema]], which is also called ''dermatitis eczema'' and ''eczematous dermatitis''.  An eczema [[diagnosis]] often implies [[atopic dermatitis]] (which is very common in children and teenagers) but, without proper context, may refer to any kind of dermatitis.<ref>ICD 10: [http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gl20.htm Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (L00-L99) > Dermatitis and eczema (L20-L30)]</ref>

In some languages, ''dermatitis'' and ''eczema'' are synonyms, while in other languages ''dermatitis'' implies an acute condition and ''eczema'' a chronic one.<ref name= "RingPrzybilla2006">{{cite book| first1= Johannes |last1= Ring| first2= Bernhard |last2= Przybilla| first3= Thomas | last3= Ruzicka| title=Handbook of atopic eczema| url= http://books.google.com/?id=jTktMX60bPwC&pg=PA4| year= 2006| publisher=Birkhäuser| isbn=978-3-540-23133-2| pages= 4 | accessdate=4 May 2010 }}</ref> The two conditions are often classified together.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:ContactDermatitis.jpg|thumb|Rash symptomatic of dermatitis]]
Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition. They range from skin rashes to bumpy rashes or including blisters. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, [[Swelling_(medical)|swelling]], [[itching]] and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the [[neck]], [[wrist]], [[forearm]], [[thigh]] or [[ankle]]. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the [[genital area]], such as the [[vulva]] or [[scrotum]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neurodermatitis/ds00712/dsection=symptoms| title=Neurodermatitis|date=|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref> Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more [[painful]] than itchy.

Although the symptoms of atopic dermatitis vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin. Typical affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the [[knee]]s, [[wrist]]s, [[face]] and [[hand]]s. 

Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms include itching, stinging and a burning sensation. [[Papules]] and [[Vesicle_(dermatology)|vesicles]] are commonly present. The small red bumps experienced in this type of dermatitis are usually about 1 cm in size, red in color and may be found symmetrically grouped or distributed on the upper or lower back, [[buttocks]], [[elbows]], [[knees]], neck, [[shoulders]], and [[scalp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dermatitispictures.net/|title=Contact Dermatitis Pictures|date=|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref> Less frequently, the rash may appear inside the [[mouth]] or near the [[hairline]].

The symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis on the other hand, tend to appear gradually, from dry or greasy scaling of the scalp ([[dandruff]]) to [[hair loss]]. In severe cases, [[pimples]] may appear along the hairline, behind the ears, on the [[eyebrows]], on the bridge of the [[Human nose|nose]], around the nose, on the [[chest]], and on the upper back. <ref name="merckmanuals">{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/skin_disorders/itching_and_noninfectious_rashes/dermatitis.html| title=Dermatitis|date=|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref> In [[newborns]], the condition causes a thick and yellowish scalp rash, often accompanied by a [[diaper rash]].

Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dermatitis-eczema/DS00339/DSECTION=symptoms| title=Symptoms|date=|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref>

==Causes==
[[File:Dermatitis por contacto.jpg|thumb|Contact dermatitis]]
A number of health conditions, allergies, genetic factors and [[Irritation|irritants]] can be responsible for causing dermatitis. There are several types of dermatitis which are distinguished based on the factor that triggers the skin reaction.

[[Cleaning products]] like:
* skin soaps
* [[detergents]]
* [[laundry soap]] or
* [[bleach]]
may cause contact dermatitis.

This specific type of dermatitis can also be caused by the exposure to [[allergens]] such as:
* [[rubber]],
* [[metal]] (nickel),
* [[jewelry]],
* [[cosmetics]],
* [[fragrances]] and [[perfume]],
* [[Weed|weeds]] (such as poison ivy) or
* a common ingredient found in topical antibiotic creams: [[neomycin]].

Individuals develop this condition due to a brief exposure to the allergen or to a prolonged exposure to an irritant, such as those mentioned above. Generally, people who become sensitive to an allergen will be allergic to it for the rest of their lives.

Dry skin, chronic irritation, [[eczema]] and [[psoriasis]] are possible causes of [[neurodermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dermatitis-eczema/ds00339/dsection=causes| title=Dermatitis|date=|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref>

Studies have shown that long term use of topical steroid cream, often used to treat atopic dermatitis, can make the condition much worse.  Total cessation of the use of topical steroid cream can lead to cure, although there is a period of severe 'rebound' between the cessation of the use of topical steroid cream and the cure.<ref>url=http://kellypalace61.web.officelive.com/Documents/CorticosteriodAddictionArticle.pdf</ref>

Another type of dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, is usually caused by physical stress, neurological conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]] or by traveling. [[Varicose veins]] and chronic conditions or infections that affect the blood flow in the legs account for potential causes of stasis dermatitis.

Dermatitis can be caused by a deficiency of Vitamin B-3, also known as niacin. Pellagra is a vitamin B3 deficiency disease. Pellagra is characterized by bilateral dermatitis. Vitamin B3 deficiency can be overcome by including vitamin-B3-rich foods in the diet including dates, avocados, tomatoes, carrots, leaf vegetables; whole-grain products and nuts.  Supplementation with the vitamin may be used.  


The cause of atopic dermatitis is not known, but the disease seems to result from a combination of genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/atopic_dermatitis/page2.htm#4whatcauses| title=What causes atopic dermatitis?|date=|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref> Usually, irritated skin, a poor immune system and a genetic factor are included among the causes of this condition. Although stress does not cause this type of dermatitis, it has been proven to worsen it. Not least, [[makeup]], [[Moisturizer|moisturizers]], [[topical corticosteroids]] and dental products that contain [[fluoride]] may cause perioral dermatitis.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Dermatitis herpetiformis is caused by a gastrointestinal condition called [[celiac disease]]. Celiac disease often results after the ingestion of aliments that contain [[gluten]].
