'''Therapy''' (Latin  ''therapīa''; {{lang-el|θεραπεία}}) literally means "curing, healing"<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=therapy&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, ''Therapy'']</ref> and is the attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].  In the medical field, it is synonymous with the word "treatment".  Among psychologists, the term may refer specifically to [[psychotherapy]] or "talk therapy".

'''Preventive therapy''' or '''prophylactic therapy''' is a treatment that is intended to prevent a medical condition from occurring.  For example, many [[vaccine]]s prevent infectious diseases.  An '''abortive therapy''' is a treatment that is intended to stop a medical condition from progressing any further.  A medication taken at the earliest signs of a disease, such as at the very symptoms of a migraine headache, is an abortive therapy.

A '''supportive therapy''' is one that does not treat or improve the underlying condition, but instead increases the patient's comfort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfids.org/about-cfids/supportive-therapy.asp |title=CFIDS |publisher=CFIDS |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09}}</ref>  Supportive treatment may be used in [[palliative care]].

==Adverse effects==
: ''Main articles: [[Adverse drug reaction]] and [[Adverse effect (medicine)|Adverse effect]]''

In addition to (or in place of) the intended therapeutic effect of a treatment, a therapist may cause undesired (adverse) effects as well.  When an adverse effect is weaker than the therapeutic effect, one commonly speaks of a "[[side effect]]".

An adverse effect may result from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure (which could be due to [[medical error]]). Some adverse effects occur only when starting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment. Using a drug or other medical intervention which is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] may increase the [[risk]] of adverse effects.  Patients sometimes [[compliance (medicine)|quit a therapy]] because of its adverse effects.  The severity of adverse effects ranges from nausea to death.
Common adverse effects include alteration in [[body weight]], change in [[enzyme]] levels, loss of function, or [[pathology|pathological]] change detected at the microscopic, macroscopic or physiological level.

Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change, including an increase or decrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals, [[food]]s, or procedures (e.g. [[drug interaction]]).

==Difference between preventions, treatments, and cures==
A [[Preventive medicine|prevention or preventive measure]] is a way to avoid an injury, sickness, or disease in the first place, and generally it will not help someone who is already ill (though there are exceptions).  For instance, many babies in developed countries are given a [[polio]] vaccination soon after they are born, which prevents them from contracting polio. But the vaccination does not work on patients who already have polio. A treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started.

A treatment treats a problem, and may lead to its cure, but treatments often ameliorate a problem only for as long as the treatment is continued, especially in [[chronic diseases]].  For example, there is no cure for AIDS, but treatments are available to slow down the harm done by HIV and delay the fatality of the disease.  Treatments don't always work.  For example, [[chemotherapy]] is a treatment for some types of cancer.  In some cases, chemotherapy may cause a cure, but not in all cases for all cancers.  When nothing can be done to stop or improve a medical condition, beyond efforts to make the patient more comfortable, the condition is said to be '''untreatable'''.  Some untreatable conditions naturally resolve on their own; others do not.

[[Cure]]s are a subset of treatments that reverse illnesses completely or end medical problems permanently.  Many diseases that cannot be cured are still treatable.

==Types of therapies==
===By therapy composition===
Treatments can be classified according to the method of treatment:
; by [[matter]]

* by [[organism]]: [[biotherapy]]

** by [[maggot]]: [[maggot therapy]]
* by [[ozone]]: [[ozonotherapy]]
* by [[salt]]: [[speleotherapy]]
* by [[serous fluid|serum]]: serotherapy
* by [[water]]: [[hydrotherapy]]

; by [[energy]]
* by [[electric energy]]
** by [[electricity]]: [[electrotherapy]]

===First or second line===
Treatment decisions often follow formal or informal algorithmic guidelines.  A ''first-line therapy'' (sometimes called induction therapy or primary therapy)<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=346494 National Cancer Institute > Dictionary of Cancer Terms > first-line therapy] Retrieved July 2010</ref> is usually recommended on the basis of clinical evidence for its efficacy in the population at large.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  If a first-line therapy either fails to resolve the issue or produces intolerable [[side effects]], additional agents (''second-line therapies'') may be substituted or added to the treatment regimen.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
