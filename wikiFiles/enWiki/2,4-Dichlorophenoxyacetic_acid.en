'''2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid''' (usually referred to by its abbreviation, '''2,4-D''') is a common systemic [[pesticide]]/[[herbicide]] used in the control of broadleaf weeds. It is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, and is the third most commonly used herbicide in North America.<ref>[http://www.24d.org/ 24d.org Industry Task Force II on 2,4-D Research Data]</ref> 2,4-D is a synthetic [[auxin]] (plant hormone), and as such it is often used in laboratories for plant research and as a supplement in plant [[cell culture]] media such as [[MS medium]].  It was a major ingredient in [[Agent Orange]] alongside its chemically similar relative, 2,4,5-T ([[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]]).

==History==
2-4D was co-discovered independently in both the US and the UK in 1941. The two teams involved were "Templeman and Colleagues at ICI" (USA) and "Nutman and Collaborators at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]]" (UK). In both cases the researchers were part of a clandestine wartime effort by their governments, to create chemical warfare agents for use in WWII. For further reading, see section 7.1 of "Herbicides and Plant Physiology By Andrew H. Cobb, John P. H. Reade"

The new chemical's ability to kill weeds was entirely accidental and not the aim of the research in either country. Because of war-time defense security reasons as well as for international legal reasons, research of this sort was never done openly. Research, production and use of chemical warfare agents were illegal actions under the [[Geneva Protocol#Chemical weapons prohibitions|Geneva Protocol]] and many other international treaties signed by both the USA and the UK. This meant that a plausible cover story was needed to hide the actual nature of any chemical warfare research.

For both the Allies and the Axis powers, the civilian label of agricultural was often used to conceal illegal and/or secret chemical warfare research. [[Fritz Haber]] (the Father of Chemical Warfare) used the same method of concealment for the chemical warfare research that he conducted between WWI and WWII, while Germany was still under international sanctions banning them from any form of military research, or the possession of any military forces. Haber's institute did research for the Nazi party that eventually led to the creation of Xyclon, the pesticide that was used as a nerve gas in Auschwitz in the Holocaust. Ironically this invention resulted in the death of nearly all of Haber's relatives. Despite the fact that Haber was a Nobel prize winning Chemist, and as such quite valuable to the German military, he was also of Jewish extraction. Haber eventually had to flee Germany for his own safety, although his institute continued on without him.

Experimentation had become quite common in the fashion of British team at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]], under the leadership of [[Judah Hirsch Quastel]]. Some discoveries were able to be eventually used to increase crop yields, although 2-4D was not used until 1946 near the end of the WWII.<ref>See the review article:  J. H. Quastel, "2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as a selective herbicide," ''Agricultural Control Chemicals'' (Washington, D.C.:  American Chemical Society, 1950), Chapter 45, pages 244-249.</ref> When it was commercially released in 1946, it became the first successful selective herbicide and allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in [[wheat]], [[maize]] (corn), [[rice]], and similar [[cereal]] grass crops, because it kills [[dicots]] (broadleaf plants), but  not most [[monocots]] (grasses).

===Genetically modified crops===
[[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]] has demonstrated [[soybean]] resistance to 2,4-D due to insertion of a bacterial aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase gene.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1013154107 | title = Robust crop resistance to broadleaf and grass herbicides provided by aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase transgenes | year = 2010 | last1 = Wright | first1 = T.

==Mode of action==
2,4-D is a synthetic [[auxin]], which is a class of [[plant hormone]]s. It is absorbed through the leaves and is translocated to the [[meristem]]s of the plant. Uncontrolled, unsustainable growth ensues, causing stem curl-over, leaf withering, and eventual plant death. 2,4-D is typically applied as an [[amine]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], but more potent [[ester]] versions exist as well.

[[File:Lantana 2-4-D effect close up.jpg|left|thumb|Effect of 2-4-d foliar application.]]

==Manufacture==
2,4-D is a member of the [[Phenoxy herbicide|phenoxy family of herbicides]], which include:
* [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T)
* [[2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (MCPA)
* 2-(2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acids ([[mecoprop]], MCPP)
* 2-(2,4-Dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid ([[dichlorprop]], 2,4-DP)
* (2,4-Dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid ([[2,4-DB]])
[[File:2-4 Dow weed killer.jpg|left|thumb|Containers of 2-4 D(ow) weed killer, ca. 1947]]
2,4-D is manufactured from [[chloroacetic acid]] and [[2,4-dichlorophenol]], which is itself produced by [[halogenation|chlorination]] of [[phenol]]. Alternatively, it may be produced by the chlorination of phenoxyacetic acid. The production processes creates several contaminants including [[isomer]]s, [[monochlorophenol]], and other [[polychlorophenol]]s and their acids.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc29.htm | publisher = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4-D)| accessdate= 22 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

===Dioxin impurities===
Some preparations of 2,4-D are contaminated with [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] due to the manufacturing process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc84.htm |title=Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4- (2,4-D): environmental aspects (EHC 84, 1989) |work=United Nations Environment Programme, the International Labour Organisation, and the World Health Organization | accessdate= 24 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100929232125/http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc84.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD) is classified as "carcinogenic to humans" by [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hardell L, Walker MJ, Walhjalt B, Friedman LS, Richter ED |title=Secret ties to industry and conflicting interests in cancer research |journal=Am.

Contamination is predominantly of the type with 2 or 3 chlorine atoms. Another form of dioxin, 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (DCDD) was found to be [[wikt:equipotent|equipotent]] to dioxin [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]] in its toxic effect on the immunity of mice. TCDD received all the publicity while the DCDD component was largely forgotten.  To this day, DCDD is not regulated or monitored by the EPA and PMRA, even though DCDD levels could be at much higher levels than TCDD.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The typical smell of 2,4-D is the breakdown product [[2,4-dichlorophenol]]. 2,4-D is toxic to the liver at small dosages.

The defoliant and herbicide [[Agent Orange]], used extensively throughout the [[Vietnam War]], contained 2,4-D. The controversies associated with the use of Agent Orange were associated with a contaminant ([[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]) in the [[2,4,5-T]] component.<ref>[http://home.comcast.net/~jurason/main/monsanto.htm The Monsanto Investigation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Applications ==
2,4-D is primarily used as an herbicide.<ref>{{HPD|2530}}</ref> It is sold in various formulations under a wide variety of brand names. 2,4-D can be found in lawn herbicide mixtures such as "Weed B Gon MAX", "PAR III", "Trillion", "Tri-Kil", "Killex" and "Weedaway Premium 3-Way XP Turf Herbicide".  All of these mixtures typically contain three active ingredients: 2,4-D, [[mecoprop]] and [[dicamba]].  Over 1,500 herbicide products contain 2,4-D as an active ingredient.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

2,4-D is most commonly used for:
* Weed control in lawns and other turf
* No-till burndown
* Control of weeds and brush along fences and highway and railroad rights of way
* Conifer release (control of broad-leaf trees in conifer plantings)
* Grass hayfields and pastures
* Cereal grains
* Corn and sorghum (occasionally)
* As a synthetic auxin analog

2,4-D continues to be used, where legal, for its low cost.  However, where municipal lawn pesticide bylaws exist, such as in Canada,<ref>[http://www.flora.org/healthyottawa/BylawList.pdf Private Property Pesticide By-laws In Canada]</ref> alternatives such as [[corn gluten meal]] and [[vinegar]]-based products are increasingly being used to combat weeds.

===Cancer risk===
Studies have yielded conflicting results, and different organizations have taken different stances, with regard to the cancer risk of 2,4-D. In 1987, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) concluded that the phenoxy acid herbicides including 2,4-D, [[MCPA]] and [[2,4,5-T]] as a group were classified as a class 2B carcinogen - "possibly carcinogenic to humans".<ref>IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans: An updating of IARC Monographs volumes 1 to 42. Supplement 7, WHO, Lyon, France 1987.</ref> A 1990 study of [[farmers]] in [[Nebraska]], even when adjusting for exposure to other chemicals, found that 2,4-D exposure substantially increased the risk of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (NHL).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/1990/09000/A_Case_Control_Study_of_Non_Hodgkin_s_Lymphoma_and.4.aspx|last= Zahm | first=Shelia Hoar| coauthors= Weisenburger, Dennis D.; Babbitt, Paula A.; Saal, Robert C.; Vaught, Jimmie B.; Cantor, Kenneth P.; Blair, Aaron| title=A Case-Control Study of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and the Herbicide 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2, 4-D) in Eastern Nebraska| journal=Epidemiology|volume=1|issue=5|year=1990|pages=349–356}}</ref>  

A 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the carcinogenicity of 2,4-D had divided opinions. None of the scientists thought the weight of the evidence indicated that 2,4-D was a “known” or “probable” cause of human cancer.  The predominant opinion indicated that it is possible that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans,  although not all of the panelists believed the possibility was equally likely: one thought the possibility was strong, leaning toward probable, and five thought the possibility was remote, leaning toward unlikely. Two panelists believed it unlikely that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans.<ref name="pmid1820267">{{cite journal| last=Ibrahim |first=MA|coauthors=Bond, GG; Burke, TA; Cole, P; Dost, FN; Enterline, PE et al.| title=Weight of the evidence on the human carcinogenicity of 2,4-D. | journal=Environ Health Perspect | year= 1991 | volume= 96 | issue=  | pages= 213–22 | pmid=1820267 | doi= | pmc=1568222 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1568222 }}</ref>

A 2000 study of 1517 former employees of  [[Dow Chemical Company]] who had been exposed to the chemical in manufacturing or formulating 2,4-D found no significant increase in risk of mortality due to NHL following 2,4-D exposure, but did find an increase in risk of mortality due to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=C J|coauthors=Beard, KK; Cartmill, JB|title=Mortality in chemical workers potentially exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) 1945-94: an update|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=58|issue=1|year=2001|pages=24–30|issn=13510711|doi=10.1136/oem.58.1.24|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/58/1/24|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5glwM8D7U|archivedate=2009-05-14|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-08|pmid=11119631|pmc=1740039}}</ref>    On August 8, 2007, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] issued a ruling that stated that existing data do not support a link between human cancer and 2,4-D exposure.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-PEST/2007/August/Day-08/p15109.htm EPA: Federal Register: 2,4-D, 2,4-DP, and 2,4-DB; Decision Not to Initiate Special Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Environmental behavior==
Owing to the longevity and extent of use, 2,4-D is among the most thoroughly studied herbicides with respect to environmental properties.  2,4-D applied at 1.16&nbsp;lb/acre to bluegrass turf in a laboratory experiment had a half-life of ten days. Other studies found half-life figures between 1.5 and 16 days. Soil microbes are primarily responsible for its disappearance in soil. Studies in Alaska and Canada failed to detect leaching in 22 weeks or from spring to fall,<ref>Forest Service, (1984). Pesticide Background Statements, Vol. I Herbicides. United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Handbook No. 633.</ref> but 2,4-D has been included on the EPA list of compounds that are likely to leach from soil.

In aquatic environments microorganisms readily degrade 2,4-D and breakdown by sunlight is not a major reason for loss. Rates of breakdown increase with increased nutrients, sediment load and dissolved organic carbon. Under oxygenated conditions the half-life can be short, in the order of one week to several weeks. 2,4-D interferes with normal plant growth processes. Uptake of the compound is through leaves, stems and roots; however, it is, in general, nonpersistent. In one study when 2,4-D was applied to grass, there were 80 ppm at day zero, 45 ppm at 14 days, and 6 ppm at 56 days. Breakdown in plants is by a variety of biological and chemical pathways.<ref>National Research Council Canada (1978). Phenoxy Herbicides - Their Effects on Environmental Quality with Accompanying Scientific Criteria for 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD). Subcommittee on Pesticides and Related Compounds, NRC Associate Committee on Scientific Criteria for Environmental Quality, Ottawa, Canada.</ref>

A number of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria have been isolated and characterized from a variety of environmental habitats.<ref>Cavalca, L., A. Hartmann, N. Rouard, and G. Soulas. 1999. Diversity of tfdC genes: distribution and polymorphism among 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid degrading soil bacteria.

As a result of the extensive [[metadata]] on environmental behavior, physiology and genetics, 2,4-D was the first herbicide for which the bacteria actively responsible for [[in situ]] degradation was demonstrated.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cupples A.M., Sims G.K. | year = 2007 | title = Identification of In Situ 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid-Degrading Soil Microorganisms using DNA-Stable Isotope Probing | url = | journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 232–238 }}</ref>  This was accomplished using the technique of DNA-based stable isotope probing, which enables a microbial function (activity), such as degrading a chemical, to be linked with the organism’s identity without the need to culture the organism involved.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Radajewski S., Ineson P., Parekh N.R., Murrell J.C. | year = 2000 | title = Stable-isotope probing as a tool in microbial ecology | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = | pages = 646–649 }}</ref>  This advancement has been particularly beneficial for the study of soil microorganisms, since only a very small fraction of the thousands of species present in highly diverse soil bacterial communities can be isolated in pure culture.

Despite its short half-life in soil and in aquatic environments, the compound has been detected in groundwater supplies in at least five States and in Canada.<ref>Howard, Philip H. Handbook of Environmental Fate and Exposure Data for Organic Chemicals. Lewis Publishers Chelsea, Michigan.</ref> It has also been detected in surface waters throughout the United States at very low concentrations.

==Legal issues==

2,4-D has been evaluated by the European Union and included on its list of approved herbicides, stating inter alia that "the review [of 2,4-D] has established that the residues arising from the proposed uses,
consequent on application consistent with good plant protection practice, have no harmful effects on human or
animal health."<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/protection/evaluation/exist_subs_rep_en.htm EUROPA - Plant Health - Plant Protection - Evaluation & Authorisation - Existing active substances - Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Concern over 2,4-D is such that it is currently not approved for use on lawns and gardens in Sweden,<ref>http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-diklorfenoxiättiksyra</ref> Denmark, Norway, Kuwait and the Canadian provinces of Québec <ref>http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/pesticides/permis-en/code-gestion-en/espace-vert.htm</ref> and Ontario.<ref>http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/en/news/2009/030401.php</ref> 2,4-D use is severely restricted in the country of Belize.
