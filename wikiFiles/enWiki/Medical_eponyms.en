'''Medical eponyms''' are terms used in [[medicine]] which are named after people (and occasionally places or things).
New discoveries are often attached to the people who made the discovery because of the nature of the [[history of medicine]]. This has produced a large number of medical [[eponym]]s:

* [[List of eponymous diseases]]
* [[List of eponymous fractures]]
* [[List of eponymous medical signs]]
* [[List of eponymous surgical procedures]]
* [[List of human anatomical parts named after people]]
* [[List of eponymous medical devices]]
* [[List of eponymous medical treatments]]
* [[List of medical eponyms with Nazi associations]]
