The strain is [[Potency (pharmacology)|potent]], and is packaged with a picture of the actor [[Tom Cruise]] laughing. Cruise sought out legal advice regarding the product, and considered a lawsuit against its manufacturers. 

Media commentators for ''[[The Toronto Star]]'',  ''[[Gawker.com|Gawker]]'', and the [[CNN]] program ''[[Showbiz Tonight]]'' analyzed the matter, and the product was the subject of a [[parody]] on a [[satire|satirical]] website. American lawyer [[Lisa Bloom]] commented that it would not be prudent for Cruise to sue over the product, and [[public relations]] writer [[Howard Bragman]] stated it was not a good idea from a legal standpoint to utilize Cruise's image in such a fashion.

But you know, Tom's not laughing to be blunt. Will there be a joint investigation or is this just a token effort - you know, a half-baked idea?"<ref name="hammer">{{cite news| last = [[A.J.

American lawyer [[Lisa Bloom]] said of the possibility that Cruise's attorneys might sue over the marijuana product, "You know, if his lawyers sue over this, I'm going to wonder what they've been smoking. Nobody really thinks that Tom Cruise is endorsing this particular kind of marijuana. Why don't celebrities occasionally just laugh - just laugh at things? This is obviously supposed to be a joke. There's a picture of him laughing on it. He's clearly not making any money off of it. He's not endorsing it. I say, just let it go."<ref name="hammer" /> [[Miami]] editor of ''[[In Touch Weekly]]'', Michael Cohen, stated "...it's well-known in the industry you don't mess with Tom Cruise. And so, that's all I can say. I'm sure his lawyers are on this like white on rice. But I'm sure he's actually not as affected by it as his lawyers are."<ref name="hammer" /> [[Public relations]] writer [[Howard Bragman]] commented, "I can tell you Tom and his lawyers do not have a sense of humor. And messing with Tom Cruise's image is risky business, OK?"<ref name="hammer" />
