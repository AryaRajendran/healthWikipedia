'''''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism''''' is a 2007 book by the [[Canadian]] [[author]] [[Naomi Klein]], and is the basis of a 2009 documentary by the same name directed by [[Michael Winterbottom]].<ref>{{imdb title|1355640}}</ref>

The book argues that the [[free market]] policies of [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Milton Friedman]] have risen to prominence in some countries because they were pushed through while the citizens were reacting to disasters or upheavals. It is implied that some man-made crises, such as the [[Falklands war]], may have been created with the intention of pushing through these unpopular reforms in their wake.

== Synopsis ==
The book has an introduction, a main body and a conclusion, divided into seven parts with a total of 21 chapters.

'''The introduction '''sketches the history of the last thirty years  where economic shock doctrine has been applied throughout the world, from [[South America]] in the 1970s to [[New Orleans]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Klein introduces two of her main themes.
#That practitioners of the shock doctrine tend to seek a blank slate on which to create their ideal free market economies, which usually requires a violent destruction of the existing economic order.
#The similarities between economic shock doctrine  and the original [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]] – a psychiatric technique where electric shocks were applied to mentally ill patients.

'''Part 1 '''begins with a chapter on psychiatric shock therapy and the covert experiments conducted by the psychiatrist [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Ewen Cameron]] in collusion with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]:  how it was partially successful in distorting and regressing patients' original personality, but ineffectual in developing a "better" personality to replace it. Parallels with economic shock therapy are made, including a digression on how government agencies harnessed some of the lessons learned to create more effective [[torture]] techniques.  Torture, according to Klein, has often been an essential tool for authorities who have implemented aggressive free market reforms – this assertion is stressed throughout the book. She suggests that for historical reasons the [[human rights]] movement has often portrayed torture without explaining its context, which has made it frequently appear as pointless cruelty.  The second chapter introduces Milton Friedman and his [[Chicago school of economics]], whom Klein describes as leading a movement committed to free markets even less regulated than before the [[Great Depression]].

'''Part 2''' discusses the use of shock doctrine to transform [[South America]]n economies in the 1970s, focusing on the coup in [[Chile]] led by General [[Augusto Pinochet]].   The apparent necessity for the unpopular policies associated with shock therapy to be supported by torture is explored.  

'''Part 3''' covers attempts to apply the shock doctrine without the need for extreme violence against sections of the population.  The mild shock therapy of [[Margaret Thatcher]] is explained as being made possible by the [[Falklands War]], while free market reform in [[Bolivia]] was possible due to a combination of pre-existing economic crises and the charisma of [[Jeffrey Sachs]]. 

'''Part 4''' reports on how the shock doctrine was applied in [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]] and to the [[tiger economies]] during the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].

'''Part 5''' introduces the "Disaster Capitalism Complex", where the author describes how companies have learnt to profit from disasters.  She talks about how the same personnel move easily from security-related posts in US government agencies to lucrative positions in corporations. 

'''Part 6''' discusses the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]], which Klein describes as the most comprehensive and full-scale implementation of the shock doctrine ever attempted.

'''Part 7''' is about the winners and losers of economic shock therapy – how narrow groups will often do very well by moving into luxurious [[gated communities]] while large sections of the population are left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and increased [[unemployment]]. 

'''Conclusion''' is about the backlash against the shock doctrine and economic institutions that propagate it like the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. South America and [[Lebanon]] post-2006 are examined as sources of positive news, where politicians are already rolling back free-market policies, with some mention of the increased campaigning by community-minded activists in South Africa and [[China]].

''[[The Irish Times]]'' describes Klein’s arguments as "compelling" with Dr. Tom Clonan reporting that she "systematically and calmly demonstrates to the reader" the way in which [[neoconservative]] figures were intimately linked to seismic events that "resulted in the loss of millions of lives".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2007/0929/1190938505497.html|

===Mixed===
The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]] Laureate and former [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist of the World Bank]] [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote a review of ''The Shock Doctrine'' for the ''[[New York Times]]'', calling the parallel between economic shock therapy and the psychological experiments conducted by Ewen Cameron "overdramatic and unconvincing" and claiming that "Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies." Nonetheless he claims that, "the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes" and that the book contains "a rich description of the political machinations required to force unsavory economic policies on resisting countries."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/bleakonomics|title=Bleakonomics|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|publisher=''New York Times''|date=2007-09-30}}</ref>
[[Shashi Tharoor]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' says that ''The Shock Doctrine'' takes Klein's criticism of capitalism an important step further, but also says that Klein "is too ready to see conspiracies where others might discern little more than the all-too-human pattern of chaos and confusion, good intentions and greed".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/21/AR2007112101919.html | work=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Doing Well by Doing Ill | date=2007-11-25 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>

===Criticism===
In the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', Stephen Holmes criticizes ''The Shock Doctrine'' as naïve, and opines that it conflates "'free market orthodoxy' with predatory corporate behaviour."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n09/holm01_.html|title=Free Marketeering|first=Stephen|last=Holmes|date=2008-05-08}}</ref> John Willman of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' describes it as "a deeply flawed work that blends together disparate phenomena to create a beguiling – but ultimately dishonest– argument."<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/215344fc-7b7d-11dc-8c53-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 The profits of doom] – John Willman, [[Financial Times]],  October 20, 2007</ref> Tom Redburn in the ''[[New York Times]]'' states that "what she is most blind to is the necessary role of entrepreneurial capitalism in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established social system to lapse into stagnation".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/29/books/29redb.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin It’s All a Grand Capitalist Conspiracy] – Tom Redburn, New York Times, September 29, 2007</ref> [[Jonathan Chait]] wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]'' that Klein "pays shockingly (but, given her premises, unsurprisingly) little attention to [[right-wing]] ideas. She recognizes that [[neoconservatism]] sits at the heart of the Iraq war project, but she does not seem to know what neoconservatism is; and she makes no effort to find out."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/books/dead-left|title=Dead Left|date=2008-07-30|publisher=[[The New Republic]]|accessdate=2009-11-26|first=Jonathan|last=Chait}}</ref> Robert Cole from ''[[The Times]]'' said, "Klein derides the 'disaster capitalism complex' and the profits and privatisations that go with it but she does not supply a cogently argued critique of free market principles, and without this ''The Shock Doctrine'' descends into a muddle of stories that are often worrying, sometimes interesting, and occasionally bizarre."<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2645272.ece ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'' by Naomi Klein, ''[[The Times]]'', ''October 12], 2007.</ref> Economist [[Tyler Cowen]], who called Klein's rhetoric "ridiculous" and the book a "true economics disaster", says that the book contains "a series of fabricated claims, such as the suggestion that [[Margaret Thatcher]] created the [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Falkland Islands crisis]] to crush the unions and foist unfettered capitalism upon an unwilling British public."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/63867?page_no=1|title=Shock Jock|first=Tyler|last=Cowen|date=2007-10-03}}</ref> [[Fred Kaplan]] said that Naomi Klein's depiction of the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]] as a "clash between Chicago-style capitalists and honorable, fledgling democrats" is ludicrous.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2175133/pagenum/2/|title=Blame Yeltsin|first=Fred|last=Kaplan|publisher=Slate|date=2007-10-02}}</ref> [[Johan Norberg]] of the [[Cato Institute]] criticizes the book, saying that "Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level". Norberg finds fault with specifics of the analysis, such as of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], which he says did not crush opposition to pro-market reforms, but in fact caused liberalization to stall for years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9384 | title=The Klein Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Polemics | accessdate= 2008-08-28 |publisher= [[Cato Institute]]}}</ref> Klein responded on her website to both Norberg and Chait, stating both had misrepresented her positions. Klein wrote that Norberg had erected a [[straw man]] by claiming that her book is about one man, Friedman, but that it is in fact about a "multifaceted ideological trend".<ref name="Klein1Year">{{cite web|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2008/09/response-attacks|title=One Year After the Publication of The Shock Doctrine, A Response to the Attacks|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Norberg again responded that Klein "actually defends only one of her central claims that I criticized. Instead she gives the impression that I have just tried to find small mistakes here and there in her book."<ref name="Norberg3Days">{{cite web | url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9626 | title=Three Days After Klein's Response, Another Attack | accessdate= 2008-09-05 |publisher= [[Cato Institute]]}}</ref>
