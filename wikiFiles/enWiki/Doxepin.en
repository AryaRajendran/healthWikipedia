'''Doxepin''' (Sinequan) is a [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic agent]] with [[tricyclic antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]] properties, known under many brand-names such as '''Aponal''', the original preparation by [[Boehringer-Mannheim]], now part of the [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] group; '''Adapine''',  '''Doxal''' ([[Orion Corporation|Orion]]), '''Deptran''', '''Sinquan''' and '''Sinequan''' ([[Pfizer]]). As doxepin [[hydrochloride]], it is the [[active ingredient]] in cream-based preparations ('''Zonalon''' and '''Xepin''') for the treatment of [[pruritus|dermatological itch]]. Doxepin is also used for the treatment of sleep maintenance, and the tradename of doxepin for this indication is '''Silenor'''.

== Medical uses ==

Doxepin is used to treat [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, and as a second line treatment of [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]] (hives).<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Doxepin|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/doxepin-hydrochloride.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

=== Pregnancy and lactation ===

If doxepin is used chronically during pregnancy, the newborn may show a withdrawal syndrome with agitation, impaired cardio-respiratory functions, disturbed urination and defecation.{{cn|date=April 2013}} Caution should be exerted in treating pregnant women on a regular basis.{{cn|date=April 2013}}


Doxepin is found in significant amounts in the milk of lactating women.{{cn|date=April 2013}} If therapy is necessary, breastfeeding should be interrupted during treatment. In order to maintain supply, the mother may pump and discard the milk during her treatment.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

== Contraindications ==

; Absolute:
* known hypersensitivity to doxepin or other [[dibenzazepines]] or other ingredients of the drug{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* acute intoxication with alcohol, [[sedative]]s, [[analgesic]]s and other psychoactive drugs{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* acute [[delirium tremens]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* untreated closed angle [[glaucoma]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* [[prostatic hypertrophy|hypertrophy of the prostate]] ''with'' urine retention{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* [[paralytic ileus]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}

; Relative:
* hypertrophy of the prostate ''without'' urine retention{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* reduced function of the bone marrow{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* organic brain disorders{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* increased risk of [[seizure]]s, preexisting [[epilepsy]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* preexisting cardiac damage, particular some [[arrhythmia]]s (e.g. sinoatrial blockage){{cn|date=April 2013}}

; Caution:
* other forms of preexisting cardiac damage (other arrhythmias, insufficience){{cn|date=April 2013}}
* [[MAOI]]s of the irreversible type ([[tranylcypromine]] among others) : These drugs should normally be stopped at least 2 weeks before therapy with doxepin is started.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Children under 12 years of age should not be treated, because no sufficient clinical experience exists for this group of age.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Tricyclic antidepressant drugs, particularly when given in high doses, can induce sinus tachycardia, changes in conduction time, and arrhythmias. A few instances of unexpected death have been reported in patients with cardiovascular disorders.{{cn|date=April 2013}} Myocardial infarction and stroke have also been reported with drugs of this class. Therefore, doxepin should be administered with extreme caution to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, those with circulatory lability, and elderly patients. In such cases, treatment should be initiated with low doses with progressive increases only if required and tolerated, and the patients should be under close surveillance at all dosage levels.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Since tricyclic agents are known to reduce the seizure threshold, doxepin should be used with caution in patients with a history of convulsive disorders.{{cn|date=April 2013}} Concurrent administration of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] and doxepin may be hazardous and, therefore, such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential.

Close supervision is required when doxepin is given to hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid medication because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity.{{cn|date=April 2013}} At doses above 150&nbsp;mg/day, it may block the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and related compounds.

Before initiation of treatment a complete and differentiated blood count should be taken.{{cn|date=April 2013}} If any value is pathologic, the blood count should be monitored closely under therapy with doxepin. If values are normal, blood counts should be taken during therapy in regular intervals (recommended: weekly during first month of therapy, monthly during the next 2 months, every 3 months afterwards).

Liver-function studies should be performed periodically.

== Side effects ==

* Central Nervous System: [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, confusion, [[nightmares]], agitation, increased anxiety, insomnia, [[seizures]] (infrequently), [[delirium]], rarely induction of [[hypomania]] and [[schizophrenia]] (stop medication immediately), [[extrapyramidal side-effect]]s (rarely), abuse in patients with polytoxikomania (rarely), [[tinnitus]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* Anticholinergic: dry mouth, constipation, even [[ileus]] (rarely), difficulties in urinating, sweating, precepitation of [[glaucoma]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* Antiadrenergic: [[hypotension]], postural collapse (if patient arises too fast from lying/sitting position to standing), [[arrhythmias]] (sinus-tachycardia, bradycardia, av-blockade){{cn|date=April 2013}}
* Allergic/toxic: skin rash, [[photosensitivity]], liver damage of the cholostatic type (rarely), [[hepatitis]] (extremely rare), leuko- or thrombopenia (rarely), [[agranulocytosis]] (very rarely), hypoplastic anemia (rarely){{cn|date=April 2013}}
* Others: frequently increased appetite, weight gain, rarely nausea, frequently impaired sexual function in men (impotence, ejaculation-difficulties), rarely [[hypertension]], rarely [[polyneuropathy]], in both sexes breast-enlargement and [[galactorrhea]] (rarely).{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* May increase or decrease liver function in some patients.<ref>Lippincot"nursing 2007 drug handbook" LWW press. 2007</ref>

=== Suicidal patients ===

Patients with suicidal thoughts, or those with previous suicidal attempts, should be monitored closely under treatment with Doxepin. Perhaps, the decision is made to hospitalize high-risk patients until remission. At least, the smallest amount of Doxepin should be prescribed at one time to minimize the risk of deliberate overdose. {{cn|date=April 2013}}

=== Drug abuse and dependence ===

Doxepin has an extremely low potential for abuse and psychological dependence (mostly noted with [[Substance_dependence|multiple-substance abusers]], possibly due to the strong anxiolytic action of Doxepin). {{cn|date=April 2013}}


Withdrawal symptoms frequently seen when treatment with doxepin is stopped abruptly (agitation, anxiety, insomnia, sometimes activation of mania or rebound depression) can be avoided by reducing the daily dose of Doxepin gradually by approximately 25% each week. If treatment has to be stopped at once due to medical reasons, the use of a benzodiazepine (e.g. Lorazepam, Clonazepam, or Alprazolam) for a maximum of 4 weeks as needed will usually suppress withdrawal symptoms.{{cn|date=April 2013}}


=== Other remarks ===

Doxepin may worsen psychotic conditions like schizophrenia and should be given with caution. The antipsychotic treatment should be continued. {{cn|date=April 2013}}

With Zonalon and Xepin; in most countries an external form (cream) is available for the treatment of itching skin disease; the effect is probably due to the affinity of doxepin for H1 and H2 receptors and action on muscarinic receptors.
Doxepin is the most anxiolytic of all the tricyclic antidepressants.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

== Interactions ==
* Irreversible [[MAOI]]s: agitation, delirium, coma, hyperpyrexia (high fever), seizures and severe changes in blood pressure. potentially fatal. Treatment-resistant hospitalized patients may be treated concomitantly with an MAO-inhibitor, if they are closely monitored by an expert and the initial dose of both drugs is low.{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* Increased drug actions:{{cn|date=April 2013}}
** other antidepressants, barbiturates, narcotics, sedating antihistaminics, anticonvulsive drugs, alcohol - resulting in increased central depression
** anticholinergics (antiparkinsonian agents, tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants) - resulting in increased anticholinergic action (dry mouth, obstipation etc.){{cn|date=April 2013}}
** Cimetidine: impairs the excretion of Doxepin - increased central depression and anticholinergic effects
** Sympathomimetics (also those used in local anesthetics like Noradrenaline): sympathomimetic effects increased (increased blood pressure, pulse rate, paleness of skin etc.){{cn|date=April 2013}}
** Nitrates and Antihypertensives (e.g. Beta-Blockers) - increased antihypertensive action with pronounced fall in blood pressure
* Decreased drug actions:
** Guanethidine, Reserpine, Guanfacine: antihypertensive effects decreased{{cn|date=April 2013}}
** Clonidine: antihypertensive effects decreased and risk of (massive) rebound hypertension.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

== Overdose ==

{{main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

If overdose is suspected, local [[poison control center]]s or emergency departments can provide advice. [[United States]] residents can call the US national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. Other worldwide poison centers can be found at the World directory of poisons centers.<ref>http://www.who.int/ipcs/poisons/centre/directory/en/</ref>

The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants.

== Pharmacology ==

Doxepin [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor|inhibits the reuptake of serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]].{{cn|date=April 2013}} Its actions of the reuptake of [[dopamine]] are negligible.{{cn|date=April 2013}} Doxepin also has [[receptor antagonist|antagonistic]] effects at a variety of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s:

* Extremely strong: [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]], [[H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.7 nM){{cn|date=April 2013}}
* Strong: [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]], [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mACh]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}
* Moderate: [[5-HT1 receptor|5-HT<sub>1</sub>]], [[local anesthetic]] action.{{CN|date=April 2013}}

== History ==

Doxepin was synthesized by Stach and Spingler from the German drug manufacturer C. F. Boehringer & Söhne GmbH in Mannheim. It was tested from 1963 to 1968 in different German and Swiss psychiatric institutions and was approved in Germany and elsewhere thereafter. The antidepressive effects were found to be excellent. Strong anxiolytic and sedative properties were also demonstrated. Doxepin has been in clinical use for several decades. The drug plays an important role in many indications today, not only in psychiatry/neurology.{{cn|date=April 2013}}
