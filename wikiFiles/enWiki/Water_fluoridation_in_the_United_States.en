As with some other countries [[water fluoridation]] in the United States is a contentious issue. As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation. On January 25, 1945, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] became the first community in the United States to fluoridate its drinking water to prevent tooth decay.<ref name=zernike/>

Fluoridation became an official policy of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lennon MA |title=One in a million: the first community trial of water fluoridation |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=759–60 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=17128347 |pmc=2627472 |doi=10.2471/BLT.05.028209}}</ref> By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.<ref name=US-WF-Stats-2006>{{cite web |author= Division of Oral Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC |title= Water fluoridation statistics for 2006 |url=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2006stats.htm |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2008}}</ref> By 2012 72% of the total U.S. population get their water from public systems that add fluoride.<ref name=zernike>{{cite news |author=[[Kate Zernike]] |coauthors= |title=In New Jersey, a Battle Over a Fluoridation Bill, and the Facts |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/nyregion/in-new-jersey-a-battle-over-fluoridation-and-the-facts.html?pagewanted=all |quote=While 72 percent of Americans get their water from public systems that add fluoride, just 14 percent of New Jersey residents do, placing the state next to last, ahead of only Hawaii, and far behind nearby New York (72 percent), Pennsylvania (54 percent) and Connecticut (90 percent). |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-23 }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of water fluoridation}}
[[Image:McKayandBlackCDC01.jpg|thumb|right|1909 photograph by Frederick McKay of [[Greene Vardiman Black]] (left) and Isaac Burton and F.Y.

Opposition to community water fluoridation in the United States is partly due to the research of Dr. Frederick McKay, who pressed the dental community for an investigation into what was then known as "Colorado Brown Stain."<ref name="csdshistory">[http://www.cs-ds.org/history.asp#fluoride History of Dentistry in the Pikes Peak Region],[http://www.cs-ds.org/index.asp Colorado Springs Dental Society] webpage, page accessed February 25, 2006.</ref> The condition, now known as [[dental fluorosis]], when in its severe form is characterized by cracking and pitting of the teeth.<ref>[http://www.nidr.nih.gov/dev/deleted_files/flouride.htm]</ref><ref>[http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=7&questionID=4858 McGraw-Hill's AccessScience<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5295412 Report Judges Allowable Fluoride Levels in Water : NPR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Of 2,945 children examined in 1909 by Dr. McKay, 87.5% had some degree of stain or mottling.  All the affected children were from the [[Pikes Peak]] region.  Despite the negative impact on the physical appearance of their teeth, the children with stained, mottled and pitted teeth also had fewer cavities than other children.  McKay brought this to the attention of [[Greene Vardiman Black]], and Black's interest was followed by greater interest within the dental profession.

Initial hypotheses for the staining included poor nutrition, overconsumption of pork or milk, [[radium]] exposure, [[List of childhood diseases|childhood disease]]s, or a [[calcium]] deficiency in the local drinking water.<ref name="csdshistory" /> In 1931, researchers from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) concluded that the cause of the [[Colorado]] stain was a high concentration of fluoride ions in the region's drinking water (ranging from 2 to 13.7&nbsp;mg/L) and areas with lower concentrations had no staining (1&nbsp;mg/L or less).<ref>Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/bauxite.htm "The Bauxite Story – A look at ALCOA"], from the [http://www.fluoride-history.de Fluoride History] website, page accessed May 12, 2006.</ref> Pikes Peak's rock formations contained the mineral [[cryolite]], one of whose constituents is fluorine.  As the rain and snow fell, the resulting runoff water dissolved fluoride which made its way into the water supply.

[[Dentistry|Dental]] and aluminum [[researchers]] then moved toward determining a relatively safe level of [[fluoride]] chemicals to be added to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of fluorosis, and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add [[fluoride]] chemicals in order to help prevent [[tooth decay]]. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.<ref name="US-WF-Stats-2006" />

===Early studies===
[[Image:H-Trendley-Dean.jpeg|thumb|left|[[H.

Achievements in public health, 1900–1999: fluoridation of drinking water to prevent dental caries.}}</ref>]]

A study of varying amounts of fluoride in water was led by Dr. [[H. Trendley Dean]], a dental officer of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]].<ref>Dean, H.T. "Classification of mottled enamel diagnosis." ''Journal of the American Dental Association'', 21, 1421 – 1426, 1934.</ref><ref>Dean, H.T. "Chronic endemic dental fluorosis." ''Journal of the American Dental Association'', 16, 1269 – 1273, 1936.</ref> In 1936 and 1937, Dr. Dean and other dentists compared statistics from [[Amarillo]], which had 2.8 – 3.9&nbsp;mg/L fluoride content, and low fluoride [[Wichita Falls]].  The data is alleged to show fewer cavities in Amarillo children, but the studies were never published.<ref name=autogenerated7>[http://www.fluoride-history.de/bartlett.htm Questionable Fluoride Safety Studies: Bartlett – Cameron, Newburgh – Kingston<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Dr. Dean's research on the fluoride-dental caries relationship, published in 1942, included 7,000 children from 21 cities in [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]].  The study concluded that the optimal amount of fluoride which minimized the risk of severe fluorosis but had positive benefits for tooth decay was 1&nbsp;mg per day, per adult.  Although fluoride is more abundant in the environment today, this was estimated to [[correlate]] with the concentration of 1&nbsp;mg/L.

In 1937, dentists Henry Klein and Carroll E. Palmer had considered the possibility of fluoridation to prevent cavities after their evaluation of data gathered by a Public Health Service team at dental examinations of Native American children.<ref>Klein H., Palmer C.E.: "Dental caries in American Indian children", Public Health Bulletin, No. 239, Dec. 1937</ref> In a series of papers published afterwards (1937–1941), yet disregarded by his colleagues within the U.S.P.H.S., Klein summarized his findings on tooth development in children and related problems in epidemiological investigations on caries prevalence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 1939, Dr. Gerald J. Cox<ref>Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/cox.htm  "Gerald Judy Cox"].</ref> conducted laboratory tests using [[rats]] that were fed aluminum and fluoride. Dr. Cox suggested adding fluoride to drinking water (or other media such as milk or bottled water) in order to improve oral health.<ref>Cox, G.J., M.C. Matuschak, S.F. Dixon, M.L. Dodds, W.E. Walker.  "Experimental dental caries IV. Fluorine and its relation to dental caries.  Journal of Dental Research, 18, 481–490, 1939.  Copy of original paper can be found [http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/6/481 here].</ref> 

In the mid-1940s, four widely cited studies were conducted.  The researchers investigated cities that had both fluoridated and unfluoridated water.  The first pair was [[Muskegon, Michigan]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], making Grand Rapids the first community in the world to add fluoride chemicals to its drinking water to try to benefit dental health on January 25, 1945.<ref name=zernike/><ref name="mntmichigan">[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=27595 After 60 Years of Success, Water Fluoridation Still Lacking in Many Communities].

In 1952 Nebraska Representative A.L. Miller complained that there had been no studies carried out to assess the potential adverse health risk to [[senior citizens]], [[pregnant women]] or people with [[chronic diseases]] from exposure to the fluoridation chemicals.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> A decrease in the incidence of tooth decay was found in some of the cities which had added fluoride chemicals to water supplies. The early comparison studies would later be criticized as, "primitive," with a, "virtual absence of quantitative, statistical methods...nonrandom method of selecting data and...high sensitivity of the results to the way in which the study populations were grouped..." in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark, "The mystery of declining tooth decay" ''Nature'', July 10, 1986</ref>

==Water fluoridation==
{{main|Water fluoridation}}
As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/benefits.htm The Benefits of Fluoride], from the [http://www.cdc.gov/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] website, accessed March 19, 2006.</ref> According to a 2002 study,<ref>[http://www2.cdc.gov/nohss/FluoridationV.asp Fluoridation Status: Percentage of U.S. Population on Public Water Supply Systems Receiving Fluoridated Water], from the [http://www.cdc.gov Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] website, accessed March 19, 2006.</ref> 67% of U.S. residents were living in communities with fluoridated water at that time.  

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] has identified community water fluoridation as one of ten great public health achievements of the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/ Community Water Fluoridation]</ref> The CDC recommends water fluoridation at a level of 0.7–1.2&nbsp;mg/L, depending on climate. The CDC also advises parents to monitor use of fluoride toothpaste, and use of water with fluoride concentrations above 2&nbsp;mg/L, in children up to age 8.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs.htm  Community Water Fluoridation FAQ]</ref> There is a CDC database for researching the water fluoridation status of neighborhood water.<ref>[http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/MWF/index.asp Oral Health – My Water's Fluoride<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1998, 70% of people polled in a survey conducted by the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) believed community water should be fluoridated, with 18% disagreeing and the rest undecided.<ref>American Dental Association Survey Center. 1998 consumers' opinions regarding community water fluoridation. Chicago, Illinois: American Dental Association, 1998</ref> In November 2006, the [[American Dental Association|ADA]] began recommending to parents that [[infants]] from 0 through 12 months of age should have their [[formula]] prepared with water that is fluoride-free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis.<ref>What is the ADA’s interim guidance on infant formula and fluoride? American Dental Association Website accessed May 28, 2008 [http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fluoride/infantsformula_faq.asp#2]</ref>

The issue of whether or not to fluoridate water supplies frequently arises in local governments.  For example, on November 8, 2005, citizens of [[Mt. Pleasant, Michigan]] voted 63% to 37% in favor of reinstating fluoridation in public drinking water after a 2004 ballot initiative ceased water fluoridation in the city.<ref>Crozier, Stacie.  [http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/pubs/adanews/adanewsarticle.asp?articleid=1684 "Michigan town votes to return fluoridation"] November 30, 2005.</ref>  At the same time, voters in Xenia, Ohio; Springfield, Ohio; Bellingham, Washington; and Tooele City, Utah all rejected water fluoridation.<ref>[http://www.noforcedfluoride.org No Forced Fluoride in Bellingham, Washington (Fluoride)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In [[Skagit County]] in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], the [[county commissioners]] in 2007 voted 2 to 1 to order the local public utility district to begin fluoridating the public water supply by Jan. 2009. $1.2 million was to be provided by the privately funded Washington Dental Service Foundation to begin building the equipment needed to add fluoride chemicals to the Judy Reservoir, which supplies the majority of Skagit Valley's water [[customers]].  The source and type of fluoride to be added to the drinking water of more than 70,000 citizens had not been disclosed.<ref>[http://www.goskagit.com/home/article/state_attorney_general_says_board_can_require_fluoridation/ goskagit.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, in February 2009, Skagit County commissioners rescinded the 2007 order, citing costs and possible lawsuits.<ref name=SVH021009>{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Commissioners vote to halt fluoride program|url=http://www.goskagit.com/home/article/commissioners_vote_to_halt_fluoride_program/|publisher=Skagit Valley Herald|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}</ref>  

The cost of adding fluoridation chemicals to the water of 44 Florida communities has been researched by the State Health Office in Tallahassee.<ref name="RingelbergCost">{{cite journal |author=Ringelberg ML, Allen SJ, Brown LJ |title=Cost of fluoridation: 44 Florida communities |journal=Journal of Public Health Dentistry |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=75–80 |year=1992 |pmid=1564695 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-7325.1992.tb02247.x}}</ref> In communities with a population of over 50,000 people, fluoridation costs were estimated at 31 cents per person per year.

==Court cases==
{{see also|Water fluoridation controversy}}
Fluoridation has been the subject of many [[Legal case|court cases]] wherein activists have sued municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical treatment and [[due process]] are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation.<ref name=Cross2003>{{cite journal |author=Cross DW, Carton RJ |title=Fluoridation: a violation of medical ethics and human rights |journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=24–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12749628}}</ref> Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation.<ref name="beck">Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) ("Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question." (citations omitted)).</ref>  To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pratt E, Rawson RD, Rubin M |title=Fluoridation at fifty: what have we learned? |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics |volume=30 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=117–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12508513}}</ref>

===Early cases===
A flurry of cases were heard in numerous state courts across the U.S. in the 1950s during the early years of water fluoridation.  State courts consistently held in favor of allowing fluoridation to continue, analogizing fluoridation to mandatory vaccination and the use of other chemicals to clean the public water supply, both of which had a long-standing history of acceptance by courts.

In 1952, a [[Code of Federal Regulations|Federal Regulation]] was adopted that stated in part, "The [[Federal Security Agency]] will regard water supplies containing fluorine, within the limitations recommended
by the Public Health Service, as not actionable under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]."<ref>17 Fed. Reg. 6743 (July 23, 1952).</ref> <!--what exactly did this do?-->

The [[Supreme Court of Oklahoma]] analogized water fluoridation to mandatory vaccination in a 1954 case.<ref name="dowell">273 P.2d 859, 862–63 (Okl. 1954) (available at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=ok&vol=/supreme/1954/&invol=1954OK194 FindLaw for Legal Professionals])</ref> The court noted, "we think the weight of well-reasoned modern precedent sustains the right of municipalities to adopt such reasonable and undiscriminating measures to improve their water supplies as are necessary to protect and improve the public health, even though no epidemic is imminent and no contagious disease or virus is directly involved .... To us it seems ridiculous and of no consequence in considering the public health phase of the case that the substance to be added to the water may be classed as a mineral rather than a drug, antiseptic or germ killer; just as it is of little, if any, consequence whether fluoridation accomplishes its beneficial result to the public health by killing germs in the water, or by hardening the teeth or building up immunity in them to the bacteria that causes caries or tooth decay. If the latter, there can be no distinction on principle between it and compulsory vaccination or inoculation, which, for many years, has been well-established as a valid exercise of police power."<ref name="dowell" />

In the 1955 case ''Froncek v. City of Milwaukee'', the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] affirmed the ruling of a circuit court which held that "the fluoridation is not the practice of medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy, by the City" and that "the legislation is a public health measure, bearing a real, substantial, and reasonable relation to the health of the city."<ref>69 N.W.2d 242, 252 (Wis. 1955)</ref>

The [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], in 1955's ''Kraus v. City of Cleveland'', said, "Plaintiff's argument that fluoridation constitutes mass medication, the unlawful practice of medicine and adulteration may be answered as a whole. Clearly, the addition of fluorides to the water supply does not violate such principles any more than the chlorination of water, which has been held valid many times."<ref>127 N.E.2d 609, 613 (Ohio 1955)</ref>

===Fluoridation consensus===
In 1973, as cases continued to be brought in state courts, a consensus developed that fluoridation, at least from a legal standpoint, was acceptable.<ref name="beck">Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) (citations omitted).</ref>  In 1973's ''Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills'', the [[California Court of Appeal]], Second District, said, "Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the [[police power]] in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question."<ref name="beck" />

===Contemporary challenges===
Advocates continue to make contemporary challenges to the spread of fluoridation.  For instance, in 2002, the city of [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]], California chose to disregard a California law mandating fluoridation of water systems with 10,000 or more hookups, and the dispute between the city and the state ended up in court.  The trial court and the intermediate appellate court ruled in favor of the state and its fluoridation mandate, and the Supreme Court of California declined to hear the case in February 2006.<ref>Jones, Donna [http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/February/10/local/stories/07local.htm "Supreme Court turns down Watsonville's appeal to keep fluoride out of its water."] Santa Cruz Sentinel.  February 10, 2006.</ref>  Since 2000, courts in Washington,<ref>Parkland Light & Water Co. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Bd. of Health, 90 P.3d 37 (Wash. 2004)</ref> Maryland,<ref>Pure Water Committee of W. MD., Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Pure Water Comm. of W. MD., Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Cumberland, MD. Not Reported in F.Supp.2d, 2003 WL 22095654 (D.Md. 2003)</ref> and Texas<ref>Espronceda v. City of San Antonio, Not Reported in S.W.3d, 2003 WL 21203878 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2003)</ref> have reached similar conclusions.

Another example occurred in the in 2011 when the [[Pinellas County, Florida]] commissioners voted to remove fluoride from the county's public drinking water. This prompted ''Times'' editor Tim Nickens and columnist Daniel Ruth to run a joint series of ten editorials in 2012, challenging the removal of the substance, "long considered the most effective method to prevent tooth decay," according to the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''.<ref name="deggans-2013">
