'''Splenomegaly''' is an enlargement of the [[spleen]]. The spleen usually lies in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the [[human abdomen]]. It is one of the four cardinal signs of ''hypersplenism'', some reduction in the number of circulating blood cells affecting [[granulocytes]], [[erythrocytes]] or [[platelets]] in any combination; a compensatory proliferative response in the bone marrow; and the potential for correction of these abnormalities by [[splenectomy]]. Splenomegaly is usually associated with increased workload (such as in [[hemolytic anemia]]s), which suggests that it is a response to hyperfunction. It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is associated with any [[disease]] process that involves abnormal [[red blood cell]]s being destroyed in the spleen. Other common causes include congestion due to [[portal hypertension]] and infiltration by [[leukemias]] and [[lymphomas]]. Thus, the finding of an enlarged spleen; along with [[caput medusae|caput medusa]]; is an important sign of portal hypertension.

==Definition==
Alotaibi G et al. classify splenomegaly as:
* Moderate splenomegaly, if the largest dimension is between 11–20&nbsp;cm
* Severe splenomegaly, if the largest dimension is greater than 20&nbsp;cm
* Splenomegaly refers strictly to spleen enlargement, and is distinct from [[hypersplenism]], which connotes overactive function by a spleen of any size. Splenomegaly and [[hypersplenism]] should not be confused.  Each may be found separately, or they may coexist.   
* Clinically if a spleen is palpable, it means it is enlarged as it has to undergo enlargement by at least two folds to become palpable. However, the tip of the spleen may be palpable in a newborn baby up to 3 months of age.

==Symptoms and signs==
[[Symptoms]] may include [[abdominal pain]], chest pain, chest pain similar to [[pleuritic]] pain when stomach, bladder or bowels are full, back pain, early satiety due to splenic encroachment, or the symptoms of [[anemia]] due to accompanying [[cytopenia]]. 

[[Medical sign|Sign]]s of splenomegaly may include a palpable left upper quadrant [[abdominal mass]] or splenic rub. It can be detected on [[physical examination]] by using [[Castell's sign]] or [[Traube's space]], but an [[ultrasound]] can be used to confirm diagnosis. In patients where the likelihood of splenomegaly is high, the physical exam is not sufficiently sensitive to detect it; abdominal imaging is indicated in such patients.<ref name="pmid8411607">{{cite journal |author=Grover SA, Barkun AN, Sackett DL |title=The rational clinical examination.

==Causes==
The most common causes of splenomegaly in developed countries are [[infectious mononucleosis]], splenic infiltration with [[cancer]] cells from a [[hematological malignancy]] and [[portal hypertension]] (most commonly secondary to [[liver disease]], and Sarcoidosis). Splenomegaly may also come from bacterial infections, such as [[syphilis]] or an infection of the heart's inner lining ([[endocarditis]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Kaiser, Larry R.; Pavan Atluri; Giorgos C Karakousis; Paige M Porrett |title=The surgical review: an integrated basic and clinical science study guide |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-5641-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  

The possible causes of moderate splenomegaly (spleen <1000 g) are many, and include:

The causes of massive splenomegaly (spleen >1000 g) are fewer, and include:
* [[visceral leishmaniasis]] (kala-azar)
* [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]]
* [[myelofibrosis]]
* [[malaria]]
* [[primary lymphoma of spleen]]

==Treatment==
If the splenomegaly underlies hypersplenism, a [[splenectomy]] is indicated and will correct the hypersplenism. However, the underlying cause of the hypersplenism will most likely remain; consequently, a thorough diagnostic workup is still indicated, as, leukemia, lymphoma and other serious disorders can cause hypersplenism and splenomegaly. After splenectomy, however, patients have an increased risk for infectious diseases.

Patients undergoing splenectomy should be [[vaccine|vaccinated]] against ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Meningococcus]]''. They should also receive annual [[influenza vaccination]]s. Long-term [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] [[antibiotic]]s may be given in certain cases.
