The '''Corrupted Blood incident''' is a [[video game glitch]] and virtual plague that occurred on September 13, 2005 in the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. The epidemic began with the introduction of the new dungeon Zul'Gurub and its end boss Hakkar who, when confronted and attacked, would cast on players a [[Health (gaming)|hit point]] draining and highly-contagious [[debuff]] spell called "Corrupted Blood."

The spell, intended to last only seconds and function only within the new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the [[virtual world]] when players discovered that the use of teleportation spells could take the affliction out of its intended confines. By both accidental and purposeful intent, a [[pandemic]] ensued that quickly killed lower-level characters and annoyed higher-leveled ones, drastically changing normal gameplay, as players did what they could to avoid infection. Despite measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning of densely populated cities (or even just not playing the game), the epidemic was only finally controlled with a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world.

The conditions and reactions of the event attracted the attention of [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] for its implications of how human populations could react to a real-world epidemic. Anti-terrorism officials also took notice of the event, noting the implications of some players planning and perpetrating a virtual [[Bioterrorism|biological attack]].

==History==
The epidemic began on September 13, 2005, when Blizzard introduced a new dungeon called Zul'Gurub into the game as part of a new update. Its [[Boss (video game)|end boss]], Hakkar, could affect players by using a [[debuff]] called Corrupted Blood, a disease that damages players over time, this one specifically doing significant damage. The disease could be passed on between any nearby characters, and would kill characters off lower level in a few seconds while higher level characters could keep themselves alive. It would disappear as time passed or when the character died. Due to a programming error, players—either inadvertently or intentionally—spread this effect by teleporting out of Zul'Gurub and passing it on to other players.<ref name="gamasutra"/>

Although the disease was intended as a "short-term, short-range annoyance", some players took advantage of the teleport glitch.<ref name="gamasutra"/> Non-player characters could contract the disease, but were [[asymptomatic]] to it and could spread it to others.<ref name="gamasutra"/> At least three of the game's servers were affected. The difficulty in killing Hakkar may have limited the spread of the disease. Discussion forum posters described seeing "hundreds of bodies" lying in the streets of the towns and cities. Deaths in ''World of Warcraft'' are not permanent, as characters are resurrected shortly afterward.<ref name="BBCwow">{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Ward|title=Deadly plague hits Warcraft world|curly=y|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=[[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]|date=2005-09-22|accessdate=2009-02-28|language=[[British English]]}}</ref> However, dying in such a way is disadvantageous to the player's character and incurs inconvenience.<ref name="ign20050922">{{cite web|url= http://pc.ign.com/articles/652/652849p1.html|title=World of Warcraft Gets Plagued|accessdate= 2009-03-03|last=McNamara|first=Tom|date=2005-09-22|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]| location=[[New York City]], [[New York]], USA|quote=In-game disease spreads throughout the realm.}}</ref>

During the epidemic, normal gameplay was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some characters with healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters who could not help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others.<ref name="gamasutra"/> Players in the game reacted to the disease as if there was real risk to their well-being.<ref name="bbcnews20070821">{{cite news|title=Virtual game is a 'disease model'|curly=y|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London, England, UK|date=2007-08-21|accessdate=2009-03-13| language=[[British English]]|quote=An outbreak of a deadly disease in a virtual world can offer insights into real life epidemics, scientists suggest.}}</ref> Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary [[quarantine]] to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take it seriously, while others took advantage of the pandemonium.<ref name="gamasutra"/> Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to [[summon]]able pets.<ref name="wired"/> Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying "quick fixes".<ref name="BBCwow"/>

The major towns and cities were abandoned by the population as panic set in and players rushed to evacuate to the relative safety of the countryside, leaving urban areas "filled to the brim with corpses", and the "city streets literally white with the bones of the dead".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/04/27/us-flu-virtual-idUKTRE53Q4HI20090427 | work=Reuters | title=Online 'blood plague' offers lessons for pandemics | date=2009-04-27}}</ref>

===Great Zombie Plague of '08===
During one week of October 2008, a [[zombie apocalypse|zombie plague]] was spread to promote the second ''World of Warcraft'' expansion, ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King|Wrath of the Lich King]]'', before its release. Unlike Corrupted Blood, this plague was intentional and was dubbed by an authorized representative of Blizzard Entertainment as the "Great Zombie Plague of '08".<ref name="Blizzard-forum">{{cite web|url=http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=11829528491&postId=118283640325&sid=1#0|title=World of Warcraft - English (NA) Forums -&gt; Regarding the Zombie Plague…|author=Tigole|date=2008-10-27|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tbDJnwZh|archivedate=2010-10-19|accessdate= 2010-10-19}}</ref> It was compared to Corrupted Blood by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', who described the zombie plague as being more true-to-life. The plague was highly contagious, but in contrast to Corrupted Blood, which had 100% transmission to nearby characters, being in the vicinity of a character infected with the zombie plague represented only a small risk of transmission. This meant that encountering a lone zombie was not as dangerous as encountering a large mass of infected.<ref name="times20081028">{{cite news|title=Analysis: Absence of risk limits parallels with real life| first=Mark|last=Henderson|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5033021.ece|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|location=[[United Kingdom]]|issn=0956-1382|date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2010-10-19|language=[[British English]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tbBziZ2y|archivedate=2010-10-19|quote=Why avoid anything like the plague if you can just come back to life?}}</ref> The event—which Blizzard ended on 28 October—earned the company both praise and criticism from its fans.<ref name="times20081028a">{{cite news|title=World of Warcraft plague halted by Blizzard|first=Murad|last=Ahmed|url= http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5032908.ece|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|location=[[United Kingdom]]|issn=0956-1382|date=2008-10-28 |accessdate=2010-10-19|language=[[British English]]|quote=The Warcraft's authorities have acted to control a virtual plague they released into the popular online game last week|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5tbD2NeVO|archivedate=2010-10-19|ref=}}</ref>

==Models for real-world research==
===Model for epidemic research===
In March 2007, Ran D Balicer, an epidemiologist physician at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev|Ben-Gurion University]] in Israel, published an article in the journal ''Epidemiology'' describing the similarities between this outbreak and the recent [[SARS]] and [[avian influenza]] outbreaks. Dr Balicer suggested role-playing games could serve as an advanced platform for modeling the dissemination of infectious diseases.<ref name="LWW">{{cite journal|last=Balicer|first=Ran|date=2005-10-05|doi= 10.1097/01.ede.0000254692.80550.60|title=Modeling Infectious Diseases Dissemination Through Online Role-Playing Games|journal=Epidemiology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=260–261|pmid=17301707}}</ref> In a follow-up article in the journal ''Science'', the game ''[[Second Life]]'' was suggested as another possible platform for these studies.<ref name="AAAS">{{cite journal|date=2005-10-05|title=This Second Life avatar looks healthy--so far|volume=316|issue=5827|pages=961|doi= 10.1126/science.316.5827.961a}}</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] contacted Blizzard Entertainment and requested statistics on this event for research on epidemics, but was told that it was a glitch.<ref name="c&vg"/>

The Corrupted Blood incident was described as a fascinating, yet accidental, case study of modeling disease origins and control at the Games for Health conference in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] by [[Gamasutra]].<ref name="gamasutra">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18571|title=GFH: The Real Life Lessons Of WoW's Corrupted Blood|accessdate= 2009-02-28|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=2008-05-20|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=''[[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer]]''|location=[[United States]]}}</ref> They compared it to a real-life epidemic, in that it originated in a remote, uninhabited region and was carried by travelers to larger regions; hosts were both human and animal, comparing it to the [[avian flu]]; was passed through close contact; and there were people, in this case non-playable characters, who could contract it but were [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="gamasutra"/> However, there were elements that differed from a real-world epidemic, including an indicator for carriers that they have the disease and how much risk they are at, which cannot be done in the real world.<ref name="gamasutra"/> One aspect of the epidemic that was not considered by [[epidemiologist]]s in their models was curiosity, describing how players would rush into infected areas to witness the infection and then rush out. This was paralleled to real-world behavior, specifically with how [[journalist]]s would rush toward a problem to cover it, and then rush back out.<ref name="gamasutra"/>

In August 2007, Nina Fefferman—a [[Tufts University]] assistant research professor of public health and family medicine—called for research on this incident, citing the resemblances with biological plagues. Some scientists want to study how people would react to environmental [[pathogen]]s, by using the virtual counterpart as a point of reference.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web|last=Sydell|first= Laura|authorlink=Laura Sydell|date=2005-10-05|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4946772|title='Virtual' Virus Sheds Light on Real-World Behavior|format=[[Streaming audio]]|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article2296354.ece|title=How a computer game glitch could help to fight off global pandemic|first= Lucy|last=Bannerman|accessdate=2007-08-21|location=London|work=The Times|date=2007-08-21}}</ref> Subsequently, she co-authored a paper in ''Lancet Infectious Disease'' discussing the epidemiological and disease modeling implications of the outbreak, along with Eric Lofgren, a [[University of North Carolina]] graduate student.<ref>Lofgren, E.T. and N.H. Fefferman. 2007. The Untapped Potential of Virtual Game Worlds to Shed Light on Real World Epidemics.

Fefferman added that the three base models have their strengths and weaknesses, but make significant behavioral assumptions. She also compared Corrupted Blood to a [[drug trial]] with mice—"a real good first step." She stated that "these are my mice" and that "I want this to be my new experiment setup." She expressed an interest in designing new diseases, perhaps non-fatal ones, to be introduced to the game so she could study how risk is viewed, how rumors would spread, and how public health notices are handled. She added that Blizzard made such notices in the original outbreak, but kept changing its position as it could not effectively deal with the problem. She commented that she did not believe it would ruin gameplay, as ''World of Warcraft'' dealt with health challenges in combat, and that games set in medieval times had such health risk. She argued that if researchers and developers worked together, it could be fun. While Blizzard was initially excited about the proposition, it became less outwardly excited over time, though never rejected it. She has been in contact with other developers, hoping to conduct the simulation in similar games to ''World of Warcraft''.<ref name="gamasutra"/>

She thought that this was the only way to accomplish such a study, as epidemiologists were limited to observational and retrospective studies, because it would be immoral to release an infectious disease into the population. She added that a computer model would be insufficient as well, as it uses mathematical rules to approximate human behavior. Doctor Gary Smith, professor of Population Biology and Epidemiology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], commented that very few mathematical models of disease transmission take host behavior into account, but also questioned how representative of real life a virtual model could be. He stated that while the characteristics of the disease could be defined beforehand, the study is just as observational as one conducted on a real-life disease outbreak. However, he added that one could argue that the proposal could give an opportunity for a study that epidemiologists may never have.<ref name="bbcnews20070821"/> Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial College, London, felt skeptical of the idea, commenting that such a study could not properly mimic genuine behavior. Using the zombie plague used to promote ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King]]'' before its release as an example, players would intentionally become infected to gain zombie powers. He added that characters could also regenerate, meaning there was low risk in becoming infected. He felt that while online games such as ''World of Warcraft'' could be set up to help scientists study epidemics, it will always be limited as their primary use is for entertainment.<ref name="times20081028a"/>

===Model for terrorism research===
In an analysis of the Corrupted Blood incident, [[Charles Blair (intelligence analyst)|Charles Blair]], deputy director of the Center of Terrorism and Intelligence Studies, said that ''World of Warcraft'' could provide a powerful new way to study how [[terrorist cell]]s form and operate. While his organization already uses computer models to study terrorists' tactics, Blair explained that because ''World of Warcraft'' involves real people making real decisions in a world with controllable bounds, which could provide a more realistic models for military intelligence analysts.
For example, one self-confessed virtual bioterrorist in ''World of Warcraft'' commented about how quickly people got smart about doing the most damage to the largest number of people.<ref name= "wired">{{cite news|title=World of Warcraft Shines Light on Terror Tactics|url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2008/03/wow_terror|publisher=[[Wired.com]]|accessdate=2009-02-27|date= 2008-03-20}}</ref>

[[Yale University]] terrorism expert Stuart Gottlieb admitted that while the outbreak was interesting and relevant to the times, he would not base a counter-terrorism strategy on a video game. Gottlieb expressed skepticism that analyzing the incident could shed light on the complex underlying causes of terrorism in the real world, as the stakes for both terrorists and civilians are lowered in a virtual setting. However, as commented by the editor of the article, "the biggest weakness for using a game as an analytical tool is that death in ''World of Warcraft'' is a nuisance at most." <ref name="wired"/>

Blizzard has maintained a position that ''World of Warcraft'' is first and foremost a game, and that it was never designed to mirror reality or anything in the real world.<ref name="wired"/>
