'''Hyperlipidemia''', '''hyperlipoproteinemia''', or '''hyperlipidaemia''' (British English) involves abnormally elevated levels of any or all [[lipid]]s and/or [[lipoprotein]]s in the [[blood]].<ref name=DorlandAndAmericanHeritage>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hyperlipidemia thefreedictionary.com > hyperlipidemia] Citing:
*Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier
*The American Heritage Medical Dictionary. 2007, 2004 by Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> It is the most common form of [[dyslipidemia]] (which also includes any decreased lipid levels).

Lipids (fat-soluble molecules) are transported in a [[apolipoprotein|protein]] [[lipoprotein|capsule]].  The size of that capsule, or [[lipoprotein]], determines its density. The lipoprotein density and type of [[apolipoprotein]]s it contains determines the fate of the particle and its influence on [[metabolism]].

Hyperlipidemias are divided in primary and secondary subtypes. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to genetic causes (such as a mutation in a receptor protein), while secondary hyperlipidemia arises due to other underlying causes such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are common in the general population, and are regarded as a modifiable risk factor for [[cardiovascular disease]] due to their influence on [[atherosclerosis]]. In addition, some forms may predispose to [[acute pancreatitis]].

== Classification ==
Hyperlipidemias may basically be classified as either familial (also called primary<ref name=Chait>{{cite journal |author=Chait A, Brunzell JD |title=Acquired hyperlipidemia (secondary dyslipoproteinemias) |journal=Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=259–78 |year=1990 |month=June |pmid=2192873 |doi= |url=}}</ref>) caused by specific genetic abnormalities, or acquired (also called secondary)<ref name=Chait/> when resulting from another underlying disorder that leads to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism.<ref name=Chait/> Also, hyperlipidemia may be idiopathic, that is, without known cause.

Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated, that is [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[hypertriglyceridemia]] or both in [[combined hyperlipidemia]]. Elevated levels of [[Lipoprotein(a)]] may also be classified as a form of hyperlipidemia.

===Familial (primary)===
Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the '''[[Donald S. Fredrickson|Fredrickson]] classification''' which is based on the pattern of lipoproteins on [[electrophoresis]] or [[Ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugation]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = DS | last2 = Lees | first2 = RS | title = A system for phenotyping hyperlipoproteinemia | journal = Circulation | volume = 31 | pages = 321–7 | year = 1965 | pmid = 14262568 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/31/3/321 | format=PDF | issue=3 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.31.3.321}}</ref> It was later adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). It does not directly account for [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]], and it does not distinguish among the different [[genes]] that may be partially responsible for some of these conditions. It remains a popular system of classification, but is considered dated by many{{who|date=June 2012}}.

====Hyperlipoproteinemia type I====
{{anchor|type I}}
Type I hyperlipoproteinemia exists in several forms:
*[[Lipoprotein lipase deficiency|Lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Type Ia)]], due to a deficiency of [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL) or altered [[apolipoprotein C2]], resulting in elevated [[chylomicron]]s, the particles that transfer fatty acids from the [[digestive tract]] to the [[liver]].
*Familial apoprotein CII deficiency (Type Ib),<ref>[http://omim.org/entry/207750 OMIM entry 207750] last updated 02/10/2009</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|227429}}</ref> a condition caused by a lack of [[lipoprotein lipase]] activator.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|533}}
*Chylomicronemia due to circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (Type Ic)<ref>[http://omim.org/entry/118830 OMIM entry 118830] updated 03/18/2004</ref>

Type I hyperlipoproteinemia usually presents in childhood with eruptive xanthomata and abdominal colic. Complications include retinal vein occlusion, acute pancreatitis, steatosis and organomegaly, and lipaemia retinalis.

====Hyperlipoproteinemia type II====
Hyperlipoproteinemia type II, by far the most common form, is further classified into type IIa and type IIb, depending mainly on whether there is elevation in the triglyceride level in addition to LDL cholesterol.

=====Type IIa=====
{{main|Familial hypercholesterolemia}}

This may be sporadic (due to dietary factors), polygenic, or truly familial as a result of a mutation either in the [[LDL receptor]] gene on [[chromosome 19]] (0.2% of the population) or the [[apolipoprotein B|ApoB]] gene (0.2%). The familial form is characterized by [[Xanthoma|tendon xanthoma]], [[xanthelasma]] and premature cardiovascular disease.  The incidence of this disease is about 1 in 500 for heterozygotes, and 1 in 1,000,000 for homozygotes.

=====Type IIb=====
The high VLDL levels are due to overproduction of substrates, including triglycerides, acetyl CoA, and an increase in B-100 synthesis. They may also be caused by the decreased clearance of LDL. Prevalence in the population is 10%.
* Familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia (FCH)
* [[Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency]], often called ([[Cholesteryl ester storage disease]])
* Secondary combined hyperlipoproteinemia (usually in the context of [[metabolic syndrome]], for which it is a diagnostic criterion)

====Hyperlipoproteinemia type III====
This form is due to high [[chylomicron]]s and IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein). Also known as ''broad beta disease'' or ''dysbetalipoproteinemia'', the most common cause for this form is the presence of [[Apolipoprotein E|ApoE]] E2/E2 genotype. It is due to cholesterol-rich VLDL (β-VLDL). Its prevalence has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 10,000.<ref name=fung2011/>

====Hyperlipoproteinemia type IV====
[[Familial hypertriglyceridemia]] is an autosomal dominant condition occurring in approximately 1% of the population.<ref name=Boman1975/>

====Hyperlipoproteinemia type V====
{{anchor|type V}}Hyperlipoproteinemia type V is very similar to type I, but with high [[VLDL]] in addition to chylomicrons.

It is also associated with glucose intolerance and hyperuricemia

====Unclassified familial forms====
Non-classified forms are extremely rare:
* [[Hyperalphalipoproteinemia]]
* [[Polygenic hypercholesterolemia]]

===Acquired (secondary)===
Acquired hyperlipidemias (also called secondary dyslipoproteinemias) often mimic primary forms of hyperlipidemia and can have similar consequences.<ref name=Chait/> They may result in increased risk of premature [[atherosclerosis]] or, when associated with marked [[hypertriglyceridemia]], may lead to [[pancreatitis]] and other complications of the [[chylomicronemia syndrome]].<ref name=Chait/> The most common causes of acquired hyperlipidemia are:
* [[diabetes mellitus]]<ref name=Chait/>
* Use of drugs such as [[diuretics]],<ref name=Chait/> [[beta blockers]],<ref name=Chait/> and [[estrogens]]<ref name=Chait/>
Other conditions leading to acquired hyperlipidemia include:
* Hypothyroidism<ref name=Chait/>
* [[renal failure]]<ref name=Chait/>
* [[nephrotic syndrome]]<ref name=Chait/>
* [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] usage<ref name=Chait/>
* Some rare [[endocrine disorder]]s<ref name=Chait/> and [[metabolic disorders]]<ref name=Chait/>
Treatment of the underlying condition, when possible, or discontinuation of the offending drugs usually leads to an improvement in the hyperlipidemia. Specific lipid-lowering therapy may be required in certain circumstances{{cn|date=June 2012}}.

Another acquired cause of hyperlipidemia, although not always included in this category, is postprandial hyperlipidemia, a normal increase following ingestion of food<ref name=Elsevier>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hyperlipidemia thefreedictionary.com > hyperlipidemia] Citing:
*Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. 2007 by Elsevier</ref>

==Management==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009|reason=What is the treatment for: # other types of primary hyperlipidaemia? # secondary hyperlipidaemia? #idiopathic hyperlipidaemia?}}

For treatment of type II, dietary modification is the initial approach but many patients require treatment with [[statin]]s (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) to reduce cardiovascular risk. If the triglyceride level is markedly raised, [[fibrate]]s may be preferable due to their beneficial effects. Combination treatment of statins and fibrates, while highly effective, causes a markedly increased risk of [[myopathy]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]] and is therefore only done under close supervision. Other agents commonly added to statins are [[ezetimibe]], [[niacin]] and [[bile acid sequestrant]]s. Dietary supplementation with fish oil is also used to reduce elevated triglycerides, with the greatest effect occurring in patients with the greatest severity.<ref>Mattar M, Obeid O. Fish oil and the management of hypertriglyceridemia. Nutr Health.  2009;20(1):41-9.</ref> There is some evidence for benefit of plant sterol-containing products and [[omega-3 fatty acid|ω<sub>3</sub>-fatty acids]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = GR | title = Management of dyslipidaemia | journal = Heart (British Cardiac Society) | volume = 90 | issue = 8 | pages = 949–55 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15253984 | pmc = 1768388 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.2003.021287 }}</ref>
