Dr. Zon's laboratory uses the [[zebrafish]] as a model system for understanding vertebrate blood development. Zebrafish blood formation is similar to that of humans, and several mutants have disorders resembling human disease.  It is possible to evaluate in the zebrafish genetic pathways important for vertebrate hematopoiesis.  Dr. Zon also uses the zebrafish to study [[cancer]].<ref name="chbresearch"/>
