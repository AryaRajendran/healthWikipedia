'''Aberrant subclavian artery''', or '''aberrant subclavian artery syndrome''', refers to a rare [[anatomical variant]] of the origin of the right or left [[subclavian artery]].  This abnormality is the most common [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] [[Blood vessel|vascular]] anomaly of the [[aortic arch]].

==Presentation==
[[File:Arteria-lusoria MRA MIP.gif|thumb|MR-angiography of aberrant subclavian artery]]
The aberrant artery usually arises just distal to the left subclavian artery and crosses in the posterior part of the [[mediastinum]] usually behind the oesophagus on its way to the right [[upper extremity]].  Such course of this aberrant vessel may cause a vascular ring around the trachea and oesophagus.
[[Dysphagia]] due to an aberrant right [[subclavian artery]] is termed [[dysphagia lusoria]].  Palsy of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is termed [[Ortner's syndrome]].

The aberrant right subclavian artery frequently arises from a dilated segment of the proximal descending aorta, the so-called Diverticulum of Kommerell. It is alternatively known as '''lusorian artery'''.

==Treatment==
Surgery is sometimes used to treat the condition.<ref name="pmid17382621">{{cite journal |author=Kouchoukos NT, Masetti P |title=Aberrant subclavian artery and Kommerell aneurysm: surgical treatment with a standard approach |journal=The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=888â€“92 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17382621 |doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2006.12.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5223(06)02279-3}}</ref>
