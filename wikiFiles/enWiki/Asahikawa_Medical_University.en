{{nihongo|'''Asahikawa Medical University'''|旭川医科大学|Asahikawa ika daigaku}}, {{nihongo|''Kyokui''|旭医|}}, or AMU, is a [[national university]] and [[medical school]] in [[Asahikawa]], [[Japan]].

== History ==
The precursor of Asahikawa Medical University is the {{nihongo|Karahuto Medical College|樺太医学専門学校|karahuto igaku senmongakou}} founded in [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]] in 1943. After [[World War II]], Karahuto Medical College was closed down because the nearby island of [[Sakhalin]] was occupied by the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] [[Red Army]]. The Asahikawa city government applied to the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] and the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture (now the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]]) for relocation of the medical college to Asahikawa, but they were rejected.

After the rejection, the Hokkaido government planned to form medical schools in both Asahikawa and [[Kushiro]] in order to address the shortage of physicians in Hokkaido. In 1973, Asahikawa Medical College was established. At first, the college had only one department: Medicine. Without a campus of its own, it was located within the [[Hokkaido University of Education]] campus. AMU moved into its original campus in 1975. In 1996, the department of Nursing Science was founded and in 2010, the college was renamed to the Asahikawa Medical University. AMU has become the core medical university in Hokkaido with many physicians from AMU working in the local community.

===Presidents===
There were two presidents of the Karahuto Medical College. There have been seven presidents of Asahikawa Medical University, including the current president, Professor Akitoshi Yoshida, who has been in office since 2007.
