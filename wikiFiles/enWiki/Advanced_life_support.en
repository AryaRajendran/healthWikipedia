'''Advanced Life Support (ALS)''' is a set of life-saving protocols and skills that extend [[Basic Life Support]] to further support the circulation and provide an open airway and adequate ventilation (breathing).

==Components of ALS==

These include:
* [[Tracheal intubation]]
* [[Rapid sequence intubation]]
* [[Cardiac]] monitoring
* [[Cardiac defibrillation]]
* [[Transcutaneous pacing]]
* [[Intravenous cannulation]] (IV)
* Intraosseous (IO) access and [[intraosseous infusion]]
* [[Surgical cricothyrotomy]]
* [[Needle cricothyrotomy]]
* [[Needle decompression]] of [[tension pneumothorax]]
* Advanced [[medication]] administration through [[parenteral]] and [[enteral]] routes (IV, IO, PO, PR, ET, SL, topical, and transdermal)
* [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] (ACLS)
* [[Pediatric Advanced Life Support]] (PALS) or Pediatric Emergencies for Pre-Hospital Providers (PEPP)
* [[Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support]] (PHTLS), Basic Trauma Life Support (BTLS) or International Trauma Life Support (ITLS)

==2010 changes==
ALS is a treatment consensus for [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] in [[cardiac arrest]] and related medical problems, as agreed in Europe by the [[European Resuscitation Council]], most recently in 2010. 

2010 revisions include:
* greater emphasis on continuous (uninterrupted) chest compression
* less emphasis on airway and breathing
* promotion of the [[intraosseous infusion]] of drugs and fluids if IV access not readily available
* further demotion of the [[precordial thump]]
* ongoing simplification
* expanded role for post-arrest hypothermia and emphasis on post-arrest normo-glycaemial.....

==ALS algorithms==
ALS assumes that [[basic life support]] (bag-mask administration of [[oxygen]] and chest compressions) are administered.

The main [[algorithm]] of ALS, which is invoked when actual [[cardiac arrest]] has been established, relies on the monitoring of the [[electrical activity]] of the [[heart]] on a cardiac monitor. Depending on the type of [[cardiac arrhythmia]], [[defibrillation]] is applied, and [[medication]] is administered. [[Oxygen]] is administered and [[endotracheal intubation]] may be attempted to secure the airway. At regular intervals, the effect of the treatment on the heart rhythm, as well as the presence of [[cardiac output]], is assessed.

Medication that may be administered may include [[adrenaline]] ([[epinephrine]]), [[amiodarone]], [[atropine]], [[bicarbonate]], [[calcium in biology|calcium]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]]. [[Saline (medicine)|Saline]] or [[colloids]] may be administered to increase the circulating volume.

While CPR is given (either manually, or through automated equipment such as [[AutoPulse]]), members of the team consider eight forms of potentially reversible causes for cardiac arrest, commonly abbreviated as "6Hs & 5Ts" according to 2005/2010 AHA [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] (ACLS).<ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-58 Part 7.2: Management of Cardiac Arrest - 112 (24 Supplement): IV-58 - Circulation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=ACLS_2003_H_T>''ACLS: Principles and Practice''. p. 71–87. Dallas: American Heart Association, 2003. ISBN 0-87493-341-2.</ref><ref name=ACLS_2003_EP_HT>''ACLS for Experienced Providers''. p. 3-5. Dallas: American Heart Association, 2003.

''Circulation'' 2005; '''112''': IV-58 – IV-66.</ref>  
Note these reversible causes are usually taught and remembered as 4Hs and 4Ts<ref>[http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/alsalgo.pdf Resuscitation Council UK adult ALS algorithm 2005]</ref>—including hypoglycaemia and acidosis with hyper/hypokalaemia and 'metabolic causes' and omitting trauma from the T's as this is redundant with hypovolaemia—this simplification aids recall during resuscitation.

==Hs and Ts==
{{main|Hs and Ts}}
;Hs
* [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]]: low oxygen levels in the blood
* [[Hypovolemia]]: low amount of circulating blood, either absolutely due to blood loss or relatively due to [[vasodilation]]
* [[Hyperkalemia]] or [[hypokalemia]]: disturbances in the level of [[potassium]] in the blood, and related disturbances of [[calcium in biology|calcium]] or [[magnesium]] levels.
* [[Hypothermia]]/[[Hyperthermia]]: body temperature not maintained
* [[Hydrogen]] ions ([[Acidosis]])
* [[Hypoglycemia]]: Low blood glucose levels
;Ts
* [[Tension pneumothorax]]: increased pressure in the thoracic cavity, leading to decreased venous return to the heart
* [[Cardiac tamponade|Tamponade]]: fluid or blood in the [[pericardium]], compressing the [[heart]]
* [[Poison|Toxic]] and/or [[medication|therapeutic]]: chemicals, whether medication or poisoning
* [[Pulmonary embolism|Thromboembolism]] and related mechanical obstruction (blockage of the blood vessels to the lungs or the heart by a [[thrombus|blood clot]] or other material)

As of December 2005, Advanced Life Support guidelines have changed significantly. A major new worldwide consensus has been sought based upon the best available scientific evidence. The ratio of compressions to ventilation's is now recommended as 30:2 for adults, to produce higher coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures. [[Defibrillation]] is now administered as a single shock, each followed immediately by two minutes of [[CPR]] before rhythm is re-assessed (five cycles of CPR). See [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]]

==Other conditions==
ALS also covers various conditions related to cardiac arrest, such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s ([[atrial fibrillation]], [[ventricular tachycardia]]), [[poison]]ing and effectively all conditions that may lead to cardiac arrest if untreated, apart from the truly [[surgical emergency|surgical emergencies]] (which are covered by [[Advanced Trauma Life Support]]).

==Who performs ALS==
Many [[healthcare provider]]s are trained to administer some form of ALS. 

In out-of-hospital settings trained [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s or [[medic]]s typically provide this level of care. Canadian paramedics may be certified in either ALS (Advance Care Paramedic-ACP) or in [[Basic Life Support]] (Primary Care Paramedic-PCP) (see [[paramedics in Canada]]). [[Emergency medical technician]]s (EMTs) are often skilled in ALS, although they may employ slightly modified version of the [[Medical algorithm]]. In the [[United States]], Paramedic level services are referred to as Advanced Life Support (ALS). Services staffed by basic EMTs are referred to as [[Basic Life Support]] (BLS), as those staffed by [[Emergency_medical_technician#Levels_of_EMTs|EMT-Intermediates]] are called [[Intermediate Life Support]] (ILS). In the [[Republic of Ireland]], Advanced Life Support (ALS) is provided by an [[Advanced paramedic]]. Advanced Paramedic (AP) is the highest clinical level (level 6) in pre-hospital care in the [[Republic of Ireland]] based on the standards set down by [[PHECC]], the Irish regulatory body for pre-hospital care and ambulance services. This terminology extends beyond emergency cardiac care to describe all capabilities of the providers. 

In hospitals, ALS is usually given by a team of [[physicians]] (DOs and MDs) and [[nurses]] (RNs), with some clinical paramedics practicing in certain systems. Cardiac arrest teams, or "Code Teams", generally include junior doctors or senior nurses and technicians from various specialties such as [[emergency medicine]], [[anesthetics]], [[general medicine|general]] or [[internal medicine]].
