'''Genu ''' (also called '''bow-leggedness''', '''bandiness''', '''bandy-leg''', and '''tibia vara'''), is a physical [[deformity]] marked by (outward) bowing of the [[Human leg|leg]] in relation to the [[thigh]], giving the appearance of an archer's [[bow (archery)|bow]].  Usually [[medial angulation]] of both [[femur]] and [[tibia]] is involved. 

==Blount's disease==
[[Blount's disease]] is a deformity in the legs, mostly from the knees to the ankles. The affected bone curves in or out and forms the usual "archers bow" which can also be called bow-legs. There are two types of Blount's disease. The first type is Infantile: this means that children under four are diagnosed with this disease. Blount's disease in this age is very risky because sometimes it is not detected and it passes to the second type of Blount's disease. The second type of Blount's disease is found mostly in older children and in teens, sometimes in one leg and sometimes in both; the patient's age determines how severe the diagnosis is.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shriner's|first=Hospital for Children – Houston, TX|title=Blount's Disease|url=http://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/en/Hospitals/Locations/Houston/Orthopaedics/Blounts.aspx|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref>

===Treatment ===
Treatment for children is typically braces but also surgery may be necessary, especially for teens. The operation consists of taking a piece of tibia out and breaking the Fibula and straightening out the bone, there is also a choice of elongating the legs. But if not treated early enough the condition worsens quickly. <ref>{{cite web|last=PubMed|first=Health|title=Blount's Disease|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002551/|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref>

==Childhood==
Children until the age of 3 to 4 have a degree of Genu Varum. The child sits with the soles of the feet facing one another; the [[tibia]] and [[femur]] are curved outwards; and, if the limbs are extended, although the ankles are in contact, there is a distinct space between the knee-joints. During the first year of life a gradual change takes place. The knee-joints approach one another; the [[femur]] slopes downward and inward towards the knee joints; the [[tibia]] become straight; and the sole of the [[foot]] faces almost directly downwards. 

While these changes are occurring, the bones, which at first consist principally of [[cartilage]], are gradually becoming [[ossified]]. By the time a normal child begins to walk the lower limbs are prepared, both by their general direction and by the rigidity of the bones which form them, to support the weight of the body.

==Causes==
If a child is sickly, either with [[rickets]] or suffering from any ailment that prevents the due ossification of the bones, or is improperly fed, the bowed condition may remain persistent. Thus the chief cause of this deformity is [[rickets]]. Skeletal problems, [[infection]], and [[tumor]]s can also affect the growth of the leg, sometimes giving rise to a one-sided bow-leggedness.  The remaining causes are occupational, especially among [[jockey]]s, and from [[physical trauma]], the condition being very likely to supervene after accidents involving the [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]]s of the [[femur]].

==Expectations==
In most cases persisting after childhood, there is little or no effect on the ability to walk.  Due to uneven stress and wear on the knees, however, even milder manifestations can see an accelerated onset of [[arthritis]].  Those with bowlegs and a genetic predisposition for developing arthritis will likely start having arthritic symptoms around age 30.

==Treatment==
Generally, no treatment is required for idiopathic presentation as it is a normal anatomical variant in young children. Treatment is indicated when it persists beyond 3 and a half years old. In the case of unilateral presentation or progressive worsening of the curvature, when caused by [[rickets]], the most important thing is to treat the constitutional [[disease]], at the same time instructing the care-giver never to place the child on its feet. In many cases this is quite sufficient in itself to effect a cure, but matters can be hastened somewhat by applying [[splint (medicine)|splints]]. When the deformity arises in older patients, either from [[physical trauma|trauma]] or occupation, the only permanent treatment is [[surgery]], but [[orthopaedic]] bracing can provide relief.
