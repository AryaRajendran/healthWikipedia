For much of the second phase of his career, cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] faced persistent allegations of doping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/index-of-lance-armstrong-doping-allegations-over-the-years|title=Index of Lance Armstrong doping allegations over the years|first=Laura|last=Weislo|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=August 24, 2012|work=Cyclingnews|publisher=Future Publishing Limited}}</ref> Armstrong consistently denied allegations of doping until a partial confession during a January 14, 2013, interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] (which then was broadcast in two parts on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network]] on January 17 and 18, 2013).

Armstrong has been criticised for his disagreements with outspoken opponents of [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] such as [[Paul Kimmage]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/cycling/article4232249.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=Countdown to the Tour de France Jonathan Vaughters and his drugsfree team | first=Paul | last=Kimmage | date=June 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/paul_kimmage/article2159415.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=They bust the addicts but the dealers ride on | first=Paul | last=Kimmage | date=July 29, 2007 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> and [[Christophe Bassons]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article451832.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=Armstrong rounds on critics over drugs storm | first=Jeremy | last=Whittle | date=July 1, 2004 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="timesonline.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article5750574.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=World in motion cycling divided by Paul Kimmage and Lance Armstrongs cancer row | date=February 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2010 | first=Owen | last=Slot}}</ref> Bassons wrote a number of articles for a French newspaper during the 1999 Tour de France which made references to doping in the [[peloton]]. Subsequently, Armstrong had an altercation with Bassons during the 1999 Tour de France where Bassons said Armstrong rode up alongside on the Alpe d'Huez stage to tell him "it was a mistake to speak out the way I (Bassons) do and he (Armstrong) asked why I was doing it.

Armstrong later confirmed Bassons's story. On the main evening news on [[TF1]], a national television station, Armstrong said: "His accusations aren't good for cycling, for his team, for me, for anybody.

According to O'Reilly the solution to the positive drug test was to get one of their compliant doctors to issue a pre-dated prescription for a steroid-based ointment to combat saddle sores. O'Reilly said she would have known if Armstrong had saddle sores, as she would have administered any treatment for it. O'Reilly said that Armstrong told her: "Now, Emma, you know enough to bring me down." O'Reilly said that on other occasions she was asked to dispose of used syringes for Armstrong and pick up strange parcels for the team.<ref>{{cite web|author=Conal Urquhart and David Walsh |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/26/lance-armstrong-doping-whistleblowers |title=Lance Armstrong: the whistleblowers |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

From his return to cycling in the fall of 2008 through March 2009, Armstrong submitted to 24 unannounced drug tests by various anti-doping authorities. All of the tests were negative for performance-enhancing drugs.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Albergotti | first = Reed | title = Lance to Drug Tester: Your Papers, Please | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date = April 8, 2009 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123915747307299985.html | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Armstrong outraged by French misbehaviour claims | agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] | date = April 7, 2009 | url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gpWQTJmkqpByIaAMzL_-ZAO8qiKg | accessdate =September 28, 2009 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

U.S. federal prosecutors pursued allegations of doping by Armstrong from 2010–2012. The effort convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate doping charges, including taking statements under oath from Armstrong's former team members and other associates; met with officials from France, Belgium, Spain, and Italy; and requested samples from the [[Agence Française de Lutte contre le Dopage|French anti-doping agency]]. The investigation was led by federal agent [[Jeff Novitzky]], who also investigated suspicions of steroid use by baseball players [[Barry Bonds]] and [[Roger Clemens]]. The probe was terminated on February 3, 2012 with no charges filed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CYC_DOPING_ARMSTRONG|title=Prosecutors close Armstrong inquiry, no charges|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}</ref>

=== Specific allegations ===

==== 2003–2005 ====
Armstrong was criticized for working with controversial trainer [[Michele Ferrari]]. Ferrari claimed that he was introduced to Lance by [[Eddy Merckx]] in 1995.<ref>[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/riders/2003/interviews/?id=ferrari03b#equipe An Interview With Dr. Michele Ferrari, part two], 2003, Tim Maloney / Cyclingnews European Editor</ref> [[Greg LeMond]] described himself as "devastated" on hearing of them working together, while [[Tour de France]] organizer [[Jean-Marie Leblanc]] said, "I am not happy the two names are mixed."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2001/jul/30/cycling.cycling1 "Drugs issue refuses to go away due to winner's Ferrari links"] [[The Guardian]]</ref> Following Ferrari's later-overturned conviction for "sporting fraud" and "abuse of the medical profession", Armstrong suspended his professional relationship with him, saying that he had "zero tolerance for anyone convicted of using or facilitating the use of performance-enhancing drugs" and denying that Ferrari had ever "suggested, prescribed or provided me with any performance-enhancing drugs."<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article489286.ece "Disappointed Armstrong cuts ties with Ferrari after conviction"] [[The Times]]</ref> 

Ferrari was later absolved of all charges by an Italian appeals court of the sporting fraud charges as well as charges of abusing his medical license to write prescriptions. The court stated that it overturned his conviction "because the facts do not exist" to support the charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/may06/may27news |title=www.cyclingnews.com&nbsp;– The World Centre of Cycling |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Ferrari, however, is still banned from practicing medicine with cyclists by the Italian Cycling Federation. According to Italian law enforcement authorities, Armstrong met with Ferrari as recently as 2010 in a country outside of Italy.<ref>[[Associated Press]], "Lance has suspicious ties: source", ''[[Japan Times]]'', April 17, 2011, p. 17.</ref>

In 2004, reporters [[Pierre Ballester]] and [[David Walsh (sports reporter)|David Walsh]] published a book alleging Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs (''[[L. A. Confidentiel]]&nbsp;– Les secrets de Lance Armstrong''). It contains allegations by Armstrong's former masseuse, [[Emma O'Reilly]], who claimed Armstrong once asked her to dispose of used syringes and to give him makeup to conceal needle marks on his arms.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Another figure in the book, [[Steve Swart]], claims he and other riders, including Armstrong, began using drugs in 1995 while members of the Motorola team, a claim denied by other team members.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/stop-strong-arm-tactics-1-1395113 | title=Stop strong-arm tactics | publisher=Scotsman.com | date=June 20, 2004 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=2 Ex-Teammates of Cycling Star Admit Drug Use|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/sports/othersports/12cycling.html| author=Juliet Macur|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 12, 2006|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> 

Allegations in the book were reprinted in the UK newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in a story by deputy sports editor Alan English in June 2004. Armstrong sued for libel, and the paper settled out of court after a High Court judge in a pre-trial ruling stated that the article "meant accusation of guilt and not simply reasonable grounds to suspect."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/tourdefrance2006/story/0,,1810152,00.html |title='&#39;The Guardian'&#39; |publisher=Sport.guardian.co.uk |date= July 1, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> The newspaper's lawyers issued the statement: "The Sunday Times has confirmed to Mr. Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance-enhancing drugs and sincerely apologized for any such impression."<ref>{{cite news|author=William Fotheringham |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/tourdefrance2005/story/0,,1536208,00.html |title=Armstrong faces legal marathon |publisher=Sport.guardian.co.uk |date= July 26, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> The same authors (Pierre Ballester and David Walsh) subsequently published "L.A. Official" and "Le Sale Tour" (The Dirty Trick), further pressing their claims that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career.

On March 31, 2005, Mike Anderson filed a brief<ref>[http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/sports/040105_lance.pdf Court brief], by ''Mike Anderson'', March 31, 2005&nbsp;– (warning: PDF-file, 2.8 MB)</ref> in Travis County District Court in Texas, as part of a legal battle following his termination in November 2004 as an employee of Armstrong. Anderson worked for Armstrong for two years as a personal assistant. In the brief, Anderson claimed that he discovered a box of [[androstenone]] while cleaning a bathroom in Armstrong's apartment in [[Girona]], Spain.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/shared/sports/tourdefrance/2005/040105lance.html | title=Papers: Lance had steroid in home | publisher=Austin American Statesman | date=April 1, 2005 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051203160602/http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/shared/sports/tourdefrance/2005/040105lance.html |archivedate= December 3, 2005 | author=Halliburton, Suzanne}}</ref> Androstenone is not on the list of banned drugs.

==== 2006–2008 ====

In June 2006, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported claims by Betsy and [[Frankie Andreu]] during a deposition that Armstrong had admitted using performance-enhancing drugs to his physician just after brain surgery in 1996. The Andreus' testimony was related to litigation between Armstrong and SCA Promotions, a Texas company attempting to withhold a $5-million bonus; this was settled out of court with SCA paying Armstrong and Tailwind Sports $7.5&nbsp;million, to cover the $5-million bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees. The testimony stated "And so the doctor asked him a few questions, not many, and then one of the questions he asked was... have you ever used any performance-enhancing drugs? And Lance said yes. And the doctor asked, what were they? And Lance said, [[growth hormone]], [[cortisone]], [[Erythropoietin|EPO]], [[steroid]]s and [[testosterone]]."<ref name="npr.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5508863 |title=Ex-Friends Say Armstrong Admitted Drug Use |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> 

Armstrong suggested Betsy Andreu may have been confused by possible mention of his ''post-operative treatment'' which included steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell-destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/10091.0.html | title=Armstrong issues statement | publisher=VeloNews | date=June 23, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060705034015/http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/10091.0.html |archivedate = July 5, 2006}}</ref> The Andreus' allegation was not supported by any of the eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2006/06/news/papers-charge-armstrong-admitted-doping_10088 | title=Papers charge Armstrong admitted doping | publisher=VeloNews | date=June 23, 2006 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> or his medical history. According to Greg LeMond (who has been [[Greg LeMond#Controversy|embroiled]] with his own disputes with Armstrong), he (LeMond) had a recorded conversation,<ref>[http://j.b5z.net/i/u/2132106/m/gregstef.mp3 recorded conversation], [[MP3]] file</ref> the transcript of which was reviewed by [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), with Stephanie McIlvain (Armstrong's contact at Oakley Inc.) in which she said of Armstrong's alleged admission 'You know, I was in that room. I heard it.' However, McIlvain has contradicted LeMond allegations on the issue and denied under oath that the incident in question ever occurred in her sworn testimony.<ref name="npr.org"/>

In July 2006, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a story on the allegations raised in the SCA case.<ref name="trail">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/09/sports/sp-armstrong9 |title=Allegations Trail Armstrong Into Another Stage |last=Abrahamson |first=Alan |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 9, 2006 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> The report cited evidence at the trial including the results of the LNDD test and an analysis of these results by an expert witness.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-070806-sp-armstrong-g,0,1296880.graphic | title=Evidence of a banned substance? | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 8, 2006 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> From the ''Los Angeles Times'' article: "The results, Australian researcher Michael Ashenden testified in Dallas, show Armstrong's levels rising and falling, consistent with a series of injections during the Tour. Ashenden, a paid expert retained by SCA Promotions, told arbitrators the results painted a "compelling picture" that the world's most famous cyclist "used EPO in the '99 Tour."<ref name="trail"/>

==== 2009–2011 ====

Ashenden's finding were disputed by the Vrijman report, which pointed to procedural and privacy issues in dismissing the LNDD test results. The ''Los Angeles Times'' article also provided information on testimony given by Armstrong's former teammate, Swart, Andreu and his wife Betsy, and [[instant messaging]] conversation between Andreu and [[Jonathan Vaughters]] regarding blood-doping in the peloton. Vaughters signed a statement disavowing the comments and stating he had: "no personal knowledge that any team in the Tour de France, including Armstrong's Discovery team in 2005, engaged in any prohibited conduct whatsoever." Andreu signed a statement affirming the conversation took place as indicated on the instant messaging logs submitted to the court.<ref name="Andy Shen">{{cite web|url=http://velocitynation.com/content/interviews/2009/michael-ashenden|accessdate=June 24, 2009|title=Interviews&nbsp;– Michael Ashenden|publisher=Velocity Nation|date=February 4, 2009|first=Andy|last=Shen}}</ref>

The SCA trial was settled out of court, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported: "Though no verdict or finding of facts was rendered, Armstrong called the outcome proof that the doping allegations were baseless." The ''Los Angeles Times'' article provides a review of the disputed positive EPO test, allegations and sworn testimony against Armstrong, but notes that: "They are filled with conflicting testimony, hearsay and circumstantial evidence admissible in arbitration hearings but questionable in more formal legal proceedings."<ref name="Andy Shen">{{cite web|url=http://velocitynation.com/content/interviews/2009/michael-ashenden|accessdate=June 24, 2009|title=Interviews&nbsp;– Michael Ashenden|publisher=Velocity Nation|date=February 4, 2009|author=Andy Shen}}</ref>

On May 20, 2010, former U.S. Postal teammate [[Floyd Landis]] accused Armstrong of doping in 2002 and 2003, and claimed that U.S. Postal team director Johan Bruyneel had bribed former [[UCI]] president [[Hein Verbruggen]] to keep quiet about a positive Armstrong test in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hart |first=Simon |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/lancearmstrong/7746819/Floyd-Landis-puts-Lance-Armstrong-at-the-centre-of-new-drug-allegations.html |title=Floyd Landis puts Lance Armstrong at the centre of new drug allegations |publisher=Telegraph |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 17, 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="Cossins">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/kimmage-landis-allegations-will-decide-the-sports-future|title=Kimmage: Landis allegations will decide the sport's future|author=Peter Cossins|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> Landis admitted there was no documentation that supports these claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id=5203604|title=Landis admits doping, accuses Lance|author=Bonnie D.

"The UCI has all the documentation to prove this fact."

In May 2011, former Armstrong teammate [[Tyler Hamilton]] told [[CBS News]] that he and Armstrong had together taken EPO before and during the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Tours de France. Armstrong's attorney, Mark Fabiani, responded that Hamilton was lying.<ref name="60minutesEPO">{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-20064858.html | title=Ex-teammate: I saw Lance Armstrong inject EPO | publisher=CBS News | work=60 Minutes | date=May 20, 2011 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> The accompanying ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigation alleged that two other former Armstrong teammates, [[Frankie Andreu]] and [[George Hincapie]], have told federal investigators that they witnessed Armstrong taking banned substances, including EPO, or supplied Armstrong with such substances.<ref name="60minutesEPO"/>

Martial Saugy, chief of the Swiss anti-doping agency, later confirmed that they found four urine samples suspicious of EPO use at the 2001 race, but said there was no "positive test" and claimed not to know whether the suspicious results belonged to Armstrong. As a result, Armstrong's lawyers demanded an apology from ''60 Minutes''.<ref>Risling, Greg, "[http://beta.news.yahoo.com/armstrongs-lawyers-want-apology-60-minutes-122558887.html Armstrong's lawyers want apology from '60 Minutes']", [[Yahoo!

Interviewed for ''[[Hardtalk]]'' on the [[BBC]] News channel, Hamilton again insisted that he and Armstrong had routinely doped together.

On August 23, 2005, ''L'Équipe'', a major French daily sports newspaper, reported on its front page under the headline "le mensonge Armstrong" ("The Armstrong Lie") that 6 urine samples taken from the cyclist during the prologue and five stages of the 1999 Tour de France, frozen and stored since at "Laboratoire national de dépistage du dopage de Châtenay-Malabry" (LNDD), had tested positive for [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) in recent retesting conducted as part of a research project into EPO testing methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/DOPAGE_ARMSTRONG.html |title=L'EQUIPE.FR Cyclisme&nbsp;– CYCLISME&nbsp;– Affaire Armstrong |work=L'Équipe |location=France |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Aug 23, 2005 |url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/AFP/2005/08/23/977278?&pbl=27 |title=AFP: No comment on Armstrong from US cycling, anti-doping groups |publisher=MyWire |date=August 23, 2005 |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> 

Armstrong immediately replied on his website, saying, "Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues and tomorrow's article is nothing short of tabloid journalism. The paper even admits in its own article that the science in question here is faulty and that I have no way to defend myself. They state: 'There will therefore be no counter-exam nor regulatory prosecutions, in a strict sense, since defendant's rights cannot be respected.' I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2005/08/news/litke-suspicion-remains-lances-opponent_8749 | title=Litke: Suspicion Remains Lance's Opponent | publisher=VeloNews | date=August 24, 2005 | accessdate=July 23, 2012 | author=Litke, Jim}}</ref>

In October 2005, in response to calls from the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for an independent investigation, the UCI appointed Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the handling of urine tests by the French national anti-doping laboratory, LNDD.

The recommendation of the commission's report was no disciplinary action against any rider on the basis of LNDD research. It also called upon the WADA and LNDD to submit themselves to an investigation by an outside independent authority.<ref name="Scholten c.s. Advocaten">{{cite web | title = Independent Investigation&nbsp;— Analysis Samples from the 1999 Tour de France | publisher=Scholten c.s.

In April 2009, Dr. Michael Ashenden said that "the LNDD absolutely had no way of knowing athlete identity from the sample they're given. They have a number on them, but that's never linked to an athlete's name. The only group that had both the number and the athlete's name is the federation, in this case it was the UCI." He added "There was only two conceivable ways that synthetic [[erythropoietin|EPO]] could've gotten into those samples. One, is that Lance Armstrong used EPO during the '99 Tour. The other way it could've got in the urine was if, as Lance Armstrong seems to believe, the laboratory spiked those samples. Now, that's an extraordinary claim, and there's never ever been any evidence the laboratory has ever spiked an athlete's sample, even during the Cold War, where you would've thought there was a real political motive to frame an athlete from a different country. There's never been any suggestion that it happened."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://velocitynation.com/content/interviews/2009/michael-ashenden |title=The possibility of tampering |publisher=Velocitynation.com |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref>

Dr. Michael Ashenden's statements are at odds with the findings of the Vrijman report. "According to Mr. Ressiot, the manner in which the LNDD had structured the results table of its report&nbsp;– i.e. listing the sequence of each of the batches, as well as the exact number of urine samples per batch, in the same (chronological) order as the stages of the 1999 Tour de France they were collected at&nbsp;– was already sufficient to allow him to determine the exact stage these urine samples referred to and subsequently the identity of the riders who were tested at that stage." The Vrijman report also says "Le Monde of July 21 and 23, 1999 reveal that the press knew the contents of original doping forms of the 1999 Tour de France".<ref name="Scholten c.s. Advocaten"/>

== 2013 confession to doping ==

In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] that aired January 17 and 18, 2013, on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network]], Armstrong confessed that he has used banned performance-enhancing drugs throughout much of his cycling career, most recently in 2005.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/19/us-cycling-armstrong-admitting-idUSBRE90H04620130119]</ref> He admitted that he used [[erythropoietin]] and [[human growth hormone]], and that he had [[blood doping|blood doped]]. Doping helped him for each of his seven Tour de France wins, Armstrong told Winfrey. According to USADA, samples from Armstrong taken in 2009 and 2010 as well are "fully consistent with blood ma­nipu­la­tion including EPO use and/or blood transfusions".<ref>{{cite news|title=Lance Armstrong and USADA's doping charges|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/jun/14/lance-armstrong-usada-doping-charges|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 June 2012}}</ref>  Despite Armstrong having collected millions of dollars in prize money in events where he has been subsequently disqualified for using banned substances, Armstrong is fighting to avoid paying prize money back.<ref>{{cite news|title=Armstrong sued over prize money|url=http://www.sportal.com.au/other-sports-news-display/armstrong-sued-over-prize-money-221220|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Sportal|date=8 February 2013}}</ref>
