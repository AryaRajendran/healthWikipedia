'''Hyperhidrosis''' is the condition characterized by abnormally increased sweating/[[perspiration]],<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book | last1 =James | first1 =William | last2 =Berger | first2 =Timothy | last3 =Elston | first3 =Dirk |year=2006 |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |edition=10th |publisher=Saunders |pages=777–8 | ISBN =978-0-7216-2921-6}}</ref> in excess of that required for regulation of [[body temperature]].
==Classification==
Hyperhidrosis can either be generalized or localized to specific parts of the body. Hands, feet, armpits, and the groin area are among the most active regions of perspiration due to the relatively high concentration of [[sweat gland]]s. When excessive sweating is localized it is referred to as primary or [[focal hyperhidrosis]]. Generalized or secondary hyperhidrosis usually involves the body as a whole and is the result of an underlying condition.

Hyperhidrosis can also be classified depending by onset, either congenital or acquired. Primary or [[focal hyperhidrosis]] is found to start during adolescence or even before and seems to be inherited as an [[autosomal]] dominant genetic trait.<!-- details per OMIM link in info box--> Primary or focal hyperhidrosis must be distinguished from secondary hyperhidrosis, which can start at any point in life. The later form may be due to a disorder of the [[thyroid]] or [[pituitary]] glands, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[tumors]], [[gout]], [[menopause]], certain drugs, or [[mercury poisoning]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Hyperhidrosis may also be divided into palmoplantar (symptomatic sweating of primarily the hands or feet), [[gustatory]] and generalized hyperhidrosis.<ref name="Andrews" />

Alternatively, hyperhidrosis may be classified according to the amount of skin affected and its possible causes.<ref name="Fitz2">{{cite book |editor1-first=Irwin M. |editor1-last=Freedberg | editor2-first=Arthur Z. | editor2-last=Eisen | editor3-first=Klaus | editor3-last=Wolff | editor4-first=K.

== Cause ==
{{Further 2 |[[Diaphoresis]]}}
The cause of primary hyperhidrosis is unknown, although some surgeons{{who|date=June 2012}} claim it is caused by [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] over-activity. [[Anxiety|Nervousness]]  or [[pleasure|excitement]] can exacerbate the situation for many sufferers. Other factors can play a role; certain [[food]]s and [[drink]]s, [[nicotine]], [[caffeine]], and [[odor|smells]] can trigger a response.

A common complaint of patients is they get nervous because they sweat, then [[positive feedback|sweat more because they are nervous]].

== Treatment ==
===Medications===
[[Aluminium chloride]] is used in regular [[antiperspirant]]s. However, hyperhydrosis sufferers need solutions or gels with a much higher concentration to effectively treat the symptoms of the condition. These antiperspirant solutions or hyperhydrosis gels are especially effective for treatment of axillary or underarm regions. Normally it takes around three to five days to see the results. The main secondary effect is irritation of the skin. For severe cases of plantar and palmar hyperhydrosis, there is some success using conservative measures such as aluminium chloride antiperspirants.<ref name="pmid18557589">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.thorsurg.2008.01.004 |title=Evidence-Based Review of the Nonsurgical Management of Hyperhidrosis |year=2008 |last1=Reisfeld |first1=Rafael |last2=Berliner |first2=Karen I. |journal=Thoracic Surgery Clinics |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=157–66 |pmid=18557589}}</ref> The Canadian Hyperhidrosis Advisory Committee has published treatment guidelines based on evidence based clinical support. It recommends an aluminium chloride hexahydrate salicylic acid gel as initial treatment for axillary, plantar and palmar hyperhydrosis 

Injections of [[botulinum toxin]] type A,(Botox, Dysport) are used to block neural control of sweat glands.<ref name="pmid18557589"/><ref name="Bushara KO, Park DM. 1437–1438">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.57.11.1437 |title=Botulinum toxin and sweating |year=1994 |last1=Bushara |first1=K O |last2=Park |first2=D M |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=57 |issue=11 |pages=1437–8 |pmid=7964832 |pmc=1073208}}</ref> The effects can last from 3–9 months depending on the site of injections.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Togel |first1=B |year=2002 |title= Current therapeutic strategies for hyperhidrosis: a review |journal=Eur J Dermatol |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=219–23 |pmid= 11978559 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref> This procedure used for underarm sweating has been approved by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm174949.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: OnabotulinumtoxinA (marketed as Botox/Botox Cosmetic), AbobotulinumtoxinA (marketed as Dysport) and RimabotulinumtoxinB (marketed as Myobloc) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}</ref>

Several [[anticholinergic]] drugs reduce hyperhidrosis. [[Oxybutynin]] (brand name ''Ditropan'') is one that has shown promise,<ref name="pmid18557589"/><ref name="pmid17057269">{{cite journal |pmid=17057269 |year=2006 |last1=Mijnhout |first1=GS |last2=Kloosterman |first2=H |last3=Simsek |first3=S |last4=Strack Van Schijndel |first4=RJ |last5=Netelenbos |first5=JC |title=Oxybutynin: Dry days for patients with hyperhydrosis |volume=64 |issue=9 |pages=326–8 |journal=The Netherlands journal of medicine}}</ref>  although it has important [[Adverse effect|side effect]]s, which include drowsiness, visual symptoms and dryness in the mouth and other mucous membranes.  A time release version of the drug is also available (''Ditropan XL''), with purportedly reduced effectiveness. [[Glycopyrrolate]] (''Robinul'') is another drug used on an off-label basis. The drug seems to be almost as effective as oxybutynin and has similar side-effects. Other anticholinergic agents that have tried to include [[propantheline bromide]] (''Probanthine'') and [[benztropine]] (''Cogentin'').{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Surgical procedures===
Sweat gland removal or destruction is one surgical option available for axillary hyperhydrosis. There are multiple methods for sweat gland removal or destruction such as sweat gland suction, retrodermal currettage, and axillary liposuction, Vaser, or Laser Sweat Ablation. Sweat gland suction is a technique adapted from liposuction.<ref name="pmid16356393">{{cite journal |pmid=16356393 |year=2005 |last1=Bieniek |first1=A |last2=Białynicki-Birula |first2=R |last3=Baran |first3=W |last4=Kuniewska |first4=B |last5=Okulewicz-Gojlik |first5=D |last6=Szepietowski |first6=JC |title=Surgical treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis with liposuction equipment: Risks and benefits |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=212–8 |journal=Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica}}</ref>

The other main surgical option is [[endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy]] (ETS), which cuts, burns, or clamps the thoracic ganglion on the main sympathetic chain that runs alongside the spine. Clamping is intended to permit the reversal of the procedure. ETS is generally considered a "safe, reproducible, and effective procedure and most patients are satisfied with the results of the surgery".<ref name="pmid18557593">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.thorsurg.2008.01.008 |title=Evidence-Based Review of the Surgical Management of Hyperhidrosis |year=2008 |last1=Henteleff |first1=Harry J. |last2=Kalavrouziotis |first2=Dimitri |journal=Thoracic Surgery Clinics |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=209–16 |pmid=18557593}}</ref> Satisfaction rates above 80% have been reported, and are higher for children.<ref name="pmid17999068">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00383-007-2073-9 |title=Do children tolerate thoracoscopic sympathectomy better than adults? |year=2007 |last1=Steiner |first1=Zvi |last2=Cohen |first2=Zahavi |last3=Kleiner |first3=Oleg |last4=Matar |first4=Ibrahim |last5=Mogilner |first5=Jorge |journal=Pediatric Surgery International |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=343–7 |pmid=17999068}}</ref><ref name="pmid15511477">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2004.03.012 |title=Long-Term Results of Thoracoscopic Sympathectomy for Hyperhidrosis |year=2004 |last1=Dumont |first1=Pascal |last2=Denoyer |first2=Alexandre |last3=Robin |first3=Patrick |journal=The Annals of Thoracic Surgery |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=1801–7 |pmid=15511477}}</ref> The procedure causes relief of excessive hand sweating in about 85-95% of patients.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20112111 |year=2010 |last1=Prasad |first1=A |last2=Ali |first2=M |last3=Kaul |first3=S |title=Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary palmar hyperidrosis |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1952–7 |doi=10.1007/s00464-010-0885-5 |journal=Surgical endoscopy}}</ref> ETS may be helpful in treating axillary hyperhidrosis, facial blushing and facial sweating; however, patients with facial blushing and/or excessive facial sweating experience higher failure rates, and patients may be more likely to experience unwanted side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10286-006-0374-z |title=Sympathectomy for hyperhydrosis: Should we place the clamps at T2–T3 or T3–T4? |year=2006 |last1=Reisfeld |first1=Rafael |journal=Clinical Autonomic Research |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=384–9 |pmid=17083007}}</ref>

Other side effects include [[Horner's syndrome|Horner's Syndrome]] (about 1%), [[gustatory]] sweating (less than 25%) and on occasion very dry hands (sandpaper hands).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fredman |first1=B |year=2000 |title=Video-assisted transthoracic sympathectomy in the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis: friend or foe? |journal=Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=226–9 |pmid= 10961751 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref> Some patients have also been shown to experience a cardiac sympathetic denervation, which results in a 10% lowered heartbeat during both rest and exercise; leading to an impairment of the heart rate to workload relationship.<ref name="pmid11717010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1010-7940(01)01002-8 |title=Infra-stellate upper thoracic sympathectomy results in a relative bradycardia during exercise, irrespective of the operated side |year=2001 |last1=Abraham |first1=P |journal=European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=1095–100 |pmid=11717010 |last2=Picquet |first2=J |last3=Bickert |first3=S |last4=Papon |first4=X |last5=Jousset |first5=Y |last6=Saumet |first6=JL |last7=Enon |first7=B}}</ref>

Lumbar [[sympathectomy]] is a relatively new procedure aimed at those patients for whom endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy has not relieved excessive plantar (foot) sweating. With this procedure the sympathetic chain in the lumbar region is clipped or divided in order to relieve the severe or excessive foot sweating. The success rate is about 97% and the operation should be carried out only if patients first have tried other conservative measures.<ref name="lumbarsympathectomy">{{cite web

The development of retrograde ejaculation, inability to maintain erection and hypertension as a result of this surgery appears to be rare to non-existent; journal articles describing the technique and case reports suggest that none of 18 men undergoing the procedure at two separate surgical units experienced sexual disability following surgery, while no mention is made of hypertension or sexual disabilities occurring in female patients.<ref name="pmid16960674"/><ref name="lumbar-clamping"/>

Percutaneous sympathectomy is a related minimally invasive procedure similar to the botulinum method, in which the nerve is blocked by an injection of [[phenol]].<ref name="pmid11523673">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00006123-200109000-00017 |title=A New Mode of Percutaneous Upper Thoracic Phenol Sympathicolysis: Report of 50 Cases |year=2001 |last1=Wang |first1=Yeou-Chih |last2=Wei |first2=Shan-Hua |last3=Sun |first3=Ming-Hsi |last4=Lin |first4=Chi-Wen |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=628–34; discussion 634–6 |pmid=11523673}}</ref> The procedure allows for temporary relief in most cases. Some medical professionals advocate the use of this more conservative procedure before the permanent surgical sympathectomy.

===Non-surgical treatments===
[[Iontophoresis]] was originally described in the 1950s, although the exact mode of action remains elusive.<ref name="pmid17166108">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1473-2130.2004.00126.x |title=Iontophoresis for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis |year=2004 |last1=Kreyden |first1=Oliver P |journal=Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=211–4 |pmid=17166108}}</ref> The affected area is placed in a device that has two pails of water with a conductor in each one. The hand or foot acts like a conductor between the positively- and negatively-charged pails. As the low current passes through the area, the minerals in the water clog the sweat glands, limiting the amount of sweat released. Some people{{who|date=June 2012}} have seen great results while others{{who|date=June 2012}} see no effect. The device can be painful (pain is usually limited to small wounds and over time the body adjusts to the procedure) and the process is time-consuming. The device is usually used for the hands and feet, but there has been a device{{clarify|date=June 2012}} created for the axillae (armpit) area and for the stump region of amputees.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Prognosis and impact==
Hyperhidrosis can have physiological consequences such as cold and clammy hands, dehydration, and skin infections secondary to maceration of the skin. Hyperhidrosis can also have devastating emotional effects on one’s individual life.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Affected people are constantly aware of their condition and try to modify their lifestyle to accommodate this problem. This can be disabling in professional, academic and social life, causing embarrassments. Many routine tasks become impossible chores, which can psychologically drain these individuals.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} 

Excessive sweating of the hands interferes with many routine activities,<ref name="Haider">{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1040708 |title=Focal hyperhidrosis: Diagnosis and management |year=2005 |last1=Haider |first1=A. |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=172 |pages=69–75 |pmid=15632408 |last2=Solish |first2=N |issue=1 |pmc=543948}}</ref> such as securely grasping objects. Some hyperhidrosis sufferers avoid situations where they will come into physical contact with others, such as greeting a person with a handshake. Hiding embarrassing sweat spots under the armpits limits the sufferers' arm movements and pose. In severe cases, shirts must be changed several times during the day. Additionally, anxiety caused by self-consciousness to the sweating may aggravate the sweating. Excessive sweating of the feet makes it harder for patients to wear slide-on or open-toe shoes, as the feet slide around in the shoe because of sweat.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Some careers present challenges for hyperhidrosis sufferers. For example, careers that require the deft use of a knife may not be safely performed by people with excessive sweating of the hands.  The risk of [[dehydration]] can limit the ability of some sufferers to function in extremely hot (especially if also humid) conditions.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473206_2{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> Even the playing of musical instruments can be uncomfortable or difficult because of sweaty hands.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Epidemiology==
Primary hyperhidrosis is estimated at 2.8% of the population of the United States.<ref name="Haider"/> It affects men and women equally, and most commonly occurs among people aged 25–64 years. Some may have been affected since early childhood.<ref name="Haider"/> About 30&ndash;50% have another family member afflicted, implying a [[genetics|genetic]] predisposition.<ref name="Haider"/>

In 2006, researchers of Saga University in Japan reported that primary palmar hyperhidrosis locus maps to 14q11.2–q13.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31127 |title=Primary palmar hyperhidrosis locus maps to 14q11.2-q13 |year=2006 |last1=Higashimoto |first1=Ikuyo |last2=Yoshiura |first2=Koh-Ichiro |last3=Hirakawa |first3=Naomi |last4=Higashimoto |first4=Ken |last5=Soejima |first5=Hidenobu |last6=Totoki |first6=Tadahide |last7=Mukai |first7=Tsunehiro |last8=Niikawa |first8=Norio |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |volume=140A |issue=6 |pmid=16470694 |pages=567–72}}</ref>
