'''Acrodermatitis enteropathica''' is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref name="pmid11254458">{{cite journal |pmid=11254458 |year=2001 |month=April |author=Wang, K; Pugh, Ew; Griffen, S; Doheny, Kf; Mostafa, Wz; Al-Aboosi, Mm; El-Shanti, H; Gitschier, J |title=Homozygosity mapping places the acrodermatitis enteropathica gene on chromosomal region 8q24.3 |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=1055–60 |pmc=1275625 |doi=10.1086/319514 |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}</ref> [[metabolic disorder]] affecting the uptake of [[zinc]], characterized by periorificial (around the natural orifices) and acral (in the limbs) [[dermatitis]], [[alopecia]] (loss of hair), and [[diarrhea]]. 

Similar features may be present in [[acquired]] [[zinc]] deficiency. This disease also is related to deficiency of zinc due to congenital causes.

Other names for ''acrodermatitis enteropathica'' include:

* Brandt syndrome
* Danbolt-Cross syndrome
* Congenital [[zinc deficiency]]

==Signs and symptoms==

Features of acrodermatitis enteropathica start appearing in the first few months of life, as the infant discontinues breast milk. There are [[erythematous]] patches and plaques of dry, scaly skin. The lesions may appear [[eczema]]tous, or may evolve further into crusted [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]], [[Blister|bulla]]s or [[pustule]]s. The lesions are frequent around the mouth and [[anus]], and also in hands, feet and [[scalp]].
There may be [[suppurative]] [[inflammation]] of the [[nail fold]] surrounding the [[nail plate]] - known as [[paronychia]]. [[Alopecia]] - loss of hair from scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes may occur. The skin lesions may be secondarily infected by [[bacteria]] such as [[Staphylococcus aureus]] or [[fungus|fungi]] like [[Candida albicans]]. These skin lesions are accompanied by diarrhea.

==Genetics==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Acrodermatitis enteropathica has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

A [[mutation]] of the [[SLC39A4]] gene on [[chromosome 8]] [[Locus (genetics)|q24.3]] is responsible for the disorder.<ref name="pmid12068297">{{cite journal |pmid=12068297 |year=2002 |month=July |author=Küry, S; Dréno, B; Bézieau, S; Giraudet, S; Kharfi, M; Kamoun, R; Moisan, Jp |title=Identification of SLC39A4, a gene involved in acrodermatitis enteropathica |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=239–40 |doi=10.1038/ng913 |journal=Nature Genetics}}</ref> The SLC39A4 gene encodes a [[transmembrane protein]] that serves as a zinc uptake protein. The features of the disease usually start manifesting as an infant is weaned from breast milk. This has led some scientists to suspect that human milk contains a beneficial substance that helps uptake of zinc and prevents the disease from being manifested while an infant is on breast milk.<ref name="pmid12743795">{{cite journal |pmid=12743795 |year=2003 |month=August |author=Michalczyk, A; Varigos, G; Catto-Smith, A; Blomeley, Rc; Ackland, Ml |title=Analysis of zinc transporter, hZnT4 ( Slc30A4), gene expression in a mammary gland disorder leading to reduced zinc secretion into milk |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=202–10 |doi=10.1007/s00439-003-0952-2 |journal=Human Genetics}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Without treatment, the disease is fatal and affected individuals may die within a few years. There is no cure for the condition. Treatment includes lifelong dietary [[zinc]] supplementation in the range of greater than 1–2&nbsp;mg/kg of bodyweight per day.
