'''Vaginal birth after caesarean''' (VBAC) refers to the practice of [[Childbirth|birthing a baby]] vaginally after a previous baby has been delivered through [[caesarean section]] (surgically).<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-vbac-overview Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) - Overview], [[WebMD]]</ref>  According to the American Pregnancy Association, 90% of women who have undergone caesarean deliveries are candidates for VBAC.<ref name="americanpregnancy">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |title=Vaginal Birth after Cesarean (VBAC) |publisher=American Pregnancy Association |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>  Approximately 60-80% of women opting for VBAC will successfully give birth vaginally, which is comparable to the overall vaginal delivery rate in the United States in 2010.<ref name="americanpregnancy"/><ref name="mayoclinic">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/VB99999 Vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC) guide], [[Mayo Clinic]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |title=NCHS Data Brief: Recent Trends in Cesarean Delivery in the United States Products |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>

==VBAC trends in the United States==
Although caesarean sections made up only 5% of all deliveries in the early 1970s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00036845.htm#00001044.htm |title=Rates of Cesarean Delivery - United States, 1993 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref> among women who did have primary caesarean sections, the century-old opinion held, "Once a caesarean, always a caesarean." A mother-driven movement supporting VBAC changed standard medical practice, and rates of VBAC rose in the 1980s and early 1990s. A major turning point occurred in 1996 when one well publicized study in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that vaginal delivery after previous caesarean section resulted in more [[Childbirth#Maternal complications|maternal complications]] than a repeat caesarean delivery.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8703167 |title=Comparison of a trial of labor with an elective second cesarean section |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |year=1996 |month=September |page=689-95 |accessdate=2012-06-16 |PMID=8703167 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199609053351001 |volume=335 |issue=10 |author=McMahon MJ, Luther ER, Bowes WA, Olshan AF}}</ref> The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology subsequently issued guidelines which identified VBAC as a high-risk delivery requiring the availability of an [[anesthesiologist]], an [[obstetrician]], and an operating room on standby.<ref>Int J Gyn Obs; 1999; vol 66, p. 197</ref> Logistical and legal (professional liability) concerns led many hospitals to enact overt or de facto VBAC bans. As a result, the rate at which VBAC was attempted fell from 26% in the early 1990s to less than 10% today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthindicators.gov/Indicators/Priorcesareanbirths_1134/Profile/Data |title=Cesarean births, repeat (percent) |publisher=Health Indicators Warehouse |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref> 

In March 2010, the [[National Institutes of Health]] met to consolidate and discuss the overall up-to-date body of VBAC scientific data and concluded, "Given the available evidence, trial of labor is a reasonable option for many pregnant women with one prior low transverse uterine incision.".<ref name="consensus.nih.gov">{{cite web|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/2010/vbacstatement.htm |title=NIH Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) Conference - Panel Statement |publisher=NIH Consensus Development Program |date=March 8â€“10, 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref> Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] reported that VBAC is a reasonable and safe choice for the majority of women with prior caesarean and that there is emerging evidence of serious harms relating to multiple caesareans.<ref name="ahrq.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tp/vbacuptp.htm |title=Vaginal Birth After Cesarean: New Insights |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref> In July 2010, The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) similarly revised their own guidelines to be less restrictive of VBAC, stating, "Attempting a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is a safe and appropriate choice for most women who have had a prior cesarean delivery, including for some women who have had two previous cesareans."<ref>[http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2010/Ob_Gyns_Issue_Less_Restrictive_VBAC_Guidelines]</ref> 

Enhanced access to VBAC has been recommended based on the most recent scientific data on the safety of VBAC as compared to repeat caesarean section, including the following recommendation emerging from the NIH VBAC conference panel in March 2010, "We recommend that hospitals, maternity care providers, health care and professional liability insurers, consumers, and policymakers collaborate on the development of integrated services that could mitigate or even eliminate current barriers to trial of labor."<ref name="consensus.nih.gov"/> The U.S Department of Health and Human Services' [[Healthy People|Healthy People 2020]] initiative includes objectives to reduce the primary caesarean rate and to increase the VBAC rate by at least 10% each.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=26 |title=2020 Topics & Objectives: Maternal, Infant, and Child Health |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>

==Drawbacks and benefits==
A caesarean section leaves a scar in the wall of the [[uterus]] which is considered weaker than the normal uterine wall. During labor in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a small risk of a ruptured uterus (0.47% chance among women having a trial of labor after cesarean section versus 0.03% among women scheduling repeat caesarean deliveries).<ref name="ahrq.gov"/> If a uterine rupture does occur, the risk of perinatal death is approximately 6%.<ref name="ahrq.gov"/> Mothers with a previous 'bikini cut' or lower uterine segment caesarian are considered the best candidates, as that region of the uterus is under less physical stress during labor and delivery. Aside from uterine rupture risk, the drawbacks of VBAC are usually minor and identical to those of any vaginal delivery, including the risk of [[Perineal tear classification|perineal tearing]]. Maternal morbidity, [[Neonatal intensive care unit|NICU]] admissions, length of hospital stay, and medical costs are typically reduced following a VBAC rather than a repeat caesarean delivery. 

The risk of post-operative infection doubles if vaginal delivery is attempted but results in another caesarean.<ref name="americanpregnancy"/> All complications of caesarean section are more likely and more severe if it is done as an emergency after a failed attempt at vaginal delivery rather than as a planned operation.{{citation-needed|date=April 2012}}

Repeat caesarean sections become increasingly complicated with each subsequent operation, as the probability of internal abdominal adhesions, bladder injuries, and abnormal [[placentation]] ([[placenta praevia]] or [[placenta accreta]]) increases dramatically, with placenta accreta reportedly affecting 50-67% of women having three or more caesarean sections. According to the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, "Abnormal placentation has been associated with both maternal and neonatal morbidity including need for antepartum hospitalization, preterm delivery, emergent caesarean delivery, [[hysterectomy]], blood transfusion, surgical injury, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and fetal and maternal death and may be life-threatening for mother and baby."<ref name="ahrq.gov"/>

==Eligibility==
Eligibility to pursue a VBAC varies widely by provider and birth setting ([[hospital]], [[birthing center]], or home). Some commonly employed criteria include:<ref name="mayoclinic"/> 

*If the previous caesarean(s) involved a low transverse incision there is less risk of uterine rupture than if there was a low vertical incision, classical incision, T-shaped, inverted T-shaped, or J-shaped incision.
*A previous successful vaginal delivery (before or after the caesarean section) increases the chances of a successful VBAC.
*The reason for the previous caesarean section should not be present in the current pregnancy.
*The more caesarean sections that a woman has had, the less likely she will be eligible for VBAC.
*The presence of [[twins]] will decrease the likelihood of VBAC.  Some doctors will still allow VBAC if the twins are positioned properly for birth.
*VBAC may be discouraged if there are other medical complications (such as diabetes), if the mother is over 40, if the pregnancy is post [[due date]], or if the baby is malpositioned.

Some contraindications of a VBAC include: <ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Queensland Maternity and Neonatal Clinical Guidelines Program|title=Queensland Maternity and Neonatal Clinical Guideline: Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)|year=2009|month=November|url=http://www.health.qld.gov.au/qcg/documents/g_vbac5-1.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> 
*Maternal request for elective repeat CS after counselling
*Maternal or fetal reasons to avoid vaginal birth in current pregnancy
*Previous uterine incision other than transverse segment including classical
*Previous complicated lower uterine segment transverse incision
*Unknown previous uterine incision
*VBAC after two or more prior lower uterine segment transverse CS is controversial
*Previous uterine rupture
*Previous hysterotomy or myomectomy entering the uterine cavity

According to ACOG guidelines, the following criteria may reduce the likelihood of VBAC success but should NOT preclude a trial of labor: having two prior caesarean sections, suspected [[fetal macrosomia]] (fetus greater than 4000-4500&nbsp;grams in weight), gestation beyond 40 weeks, twin gestation, and previous low vertical or unknown previous incision type, provided a classical incision is not suspected.<ref>ACOG Practice Bulletin Number 115, August 2010</ref>

Depending on the provider, special precautions may be encouraged during a trial of labor following a caesarean section, including IV or IV port placement, continuous or intermittent fetal monitoring, and conservative or absent labor induction and augmentation using chemical stimulants. Other intrapartum management options, including analgesia/anesthesia, are identical to those of any labor and vaginal delivery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guideline.gov/syntheses/printView.aspx?id=25231 |title=Guideline Synthesis: Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) |publisher=National Guideline Clearinghouse |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>
