'''Familial Mediterranean fever''' (FMF) is a [[genetic disorder|hereditary]] [[inflammation|inflammatory]] disorder<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|149}}.  FMF is an autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in [[MEFV]], a gene which encodes a 781–amino acid protein denoted [[pyrin]].<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Chae JJ |title=The familial Mediterranean fever protein, pyrin, is cleaved by caspase-1 and activates NF-kappaB through its N-terminal fragment |journal= Blood|volume=112 |issue=5 |pages=1794–1803 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid= 18577712|pmc=2518886 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-01-134932 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/112/5/1794 |author-separator=, |author2=Wood G |author3=Richard K |display-authors=3 |last4=Jaffe |first4=H. |last5=Colburn |first5=N.

The disorder has been given various names including familial paroxysmal polyserositis, periodic peritonitis, recurrent polyserositis, benign paroxysmal peritonitis, periodic disease or periodic fever, Reimann periodic disease or Reimann's syndrome, Siegal-Cattan-Mamou disease, and Wolff periodic disease.<ref name='pubmedhealth'>{{cite web | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001402/ | title = Familial Mediterranean fever - PubMed Health | accessdate = 2011-04-24 | last = Dugdale III | first = David C | coauthors = Jatin Vyas | date = 2010-09-15 | work = PubMed Health | publisher = National Centre for Biotechnology Information}}</ref><ref name='whonamedit'>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2503|Siegal-Cattan-Mamou syndrome}}</ref><ref name='ghr'>{{cite web | url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-mediterranean-fever | title = Familial Mediterranean fever - Genetics Home Reference | accessdate = 2011-04-24 | date = 2011-04-14 | work = Genetics Home Reference | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yBV5KJI4 | archivedate = 2011-04-24}}</ref> Note that "periodic fever" can also refer to any of the [[Periodic fever syndrome]]s.

==Epidemiology==
FMF affects groups of people originating from around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (hence its name). It is prominently present in the [[Sephardi]] [[Judaism|Jews]] (and, to a much lesser extent, [[Ashkenazi]] Jews), [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], Armenians and [[Arabs]].<ref name=Livneh>{{cite journal |author=Livneh A, Langevitz P |title=Diagnostic and treatment concerns in familial Mediterranean fever |journal=Baillieres Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=477–498 |year=2000 |pmid=10985982 |doi=10.1053/berh.2000.0089}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
===Attacks===
There are seven types of attacks. Ninety percent of all patients have their first attacks before they are 18 years old. All develop over 2–4 hours and last anywhere from 6 hours to 4 days. Most attacks involve [[fever]].<ref name=Livneh/>
# Abdominal attacks, featuring [[abdominal pain]], affect the whole abdomen with all signs of peritonitis (inflammation of abdominal lining), and acute abdominal pain like [[appendicitis]]. They occur in 95% of all patients and may lead to unnecessary [[laparotomy]]. Incomplete attacks, with local tenderness and normal blood tests, have been reported.
# Joint attacks mainly occur in large joints, especially in the legs. Usually, only one joint is affected. Seventy-five percent of all FMF patients experience joint attacks.
# Chest attacks include [[pleuritis]] (inflammation of the [[pleura]]) and [[pericarditis]] (inflammation of the [[pericardium]]). Pleuritis occurs in 40% of patients, and makes it difficult to breathe or lie flat, but pericarditis is rare.
# [[Scrotum|Scrotal]] attacks due to inflammation of the [[tunica vaginalis]] occurs in up to 5% and may be mistaken for [[acute scrotum]] (i.e. [[testicular torsion]]).
# [[Myalgia]] (rare in isolation)
# [[Erysipelas|Erysipeloid]] (a skin reaction on the legs, rare in isolation)
# Fever without any of the other symptoms listed above (25%)

===Complications===
[[AA-amyloidosis]] with [[renal failure]] is a complication and may develop without overt crises. AA amyloid protein is produced in very large quantities during attacks, and at a low rate between them, and accumulates mainly in the [[kidney]], as well as the [[heart]], [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[thyroid]].<ref name=Livneh/>

There appears to be an increase in the risk for developing particular [[vasculitis]]-related diseases (e.g. [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]]), [[spondylarthropathy]], prolonged [[arthritis]] of certain joints and protracted myalgia.<ref name=Livneh/>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is clinically made on the basis of the history of typical attacks, especially in patients from the ethnic groups in which FMF is more highly prevalent. An [[acute phase response]] is present during attacks, with high [[C-reactive protein]] levels, an elevated [[white blood cell]] count and other markers of [[inflammation]]. In patients with a long history of attacks, monitoring the [[renal function]] is of importance in predicting [[chronic renal failure]].<ref name=Livneh/> 

A genetic test is also available to detect mutations in the ''MEFV'' gene.  Sequencing of exons 2, 3, 5, and 10 of this gene detects an estimated 97% of all known mutations.<ref name=Livneh/>

A specific and highly sensitive test for FMF is the "[[Metaraminol]] Provocative Test (MPT)," whereby a single 10&nbsp;mg infusion of Metaraminol is administered to the patient. A positive diagnosis is made if the patient presents with a typical, albeit milder, FMF attack within 48 hours. As MPT is more sensitive than specific, it does not identify all cases of FMF. Although a positive MPT can be very useful.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Barakat MH, El-Khawad AO, Gumaa KA, El-Sobki NI, Fenech FF| title=Metaraminol provocative test: a specific diagnostic test for familial Mediterranean fever | journal=Lancet | year= 1984 | volume= 1 | issue= 8378 | pages= 656–7 | pmid=6142351 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Huppertz HI, Michels H| title=[The metaraminol provocation test in the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever] | journal=Monatsschr Kinderheilkd | year= 1988 | volume= 136 | issue= 5 | pages= 243–5 | pmid=3405225 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Virtually all cases are due to a mutation in the ''MEFV'' gene on the [[Chromosome 16 (human)|sixteenth chromosome]], which codes for a protein called ''pyrin'' or ''marenostrin''. Various mutations of this gene lead to FMF, although some mutations cause a more severe picture than others. Mutations occur mainly in [[exon]]s 2, 3, 5 and 10.<ref name=Livneh/>

The function of pyrin has not been completely elucidated, but it appears to be a suppressor of the activation of [[caspase 1]], the [[enzyme]] that stimulates production of [[IL1B|interleukin 1β]], a [[cytokine]] central to the process of [[inflammation]]. In other words an ineffective pyrin doesn't inhibit inflammation normally, resulting in inflammatory episodes of membranes at differing sites. It is not conclusively known what exactly sets off the attacks, and why overproduction of IL-1 would lead to particular symptoms in particular organs (e.g. joints or the peritoneal cavity).<ref name=Livneh/>

==Genetics==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Familial Mediterranean fever has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

The ''[[MEFV]]'' gene is located on the short arm of [[chromosome 16 (human)|chromosome 16]] (16p13). The disorder inherits in an [[autosomal recessive]] fashion. Therefore, two [[asymptomatic carrier]] parents have a 25% chance of a child with the disorder, a 50% chance of a child who is an asymptomatic carrier and a 25% chance of a child who does not carry the disorder. FMF patients who have children with a carrier or another FMF patient have a 50% and 100% chance, respectively, of having a child with FMF.<ref name=FConsort/><ref name=IConsort/>

There is one known case of an affected patient with only one parent who is a carrier.  This is caused by a unique mutation on the [[chromosome 16 (human)|sixteenth chromosome]].

==Treatment==
Attacks are self-limiting, and require [[analgesia]] and [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s (such as [[diclofenac]]).<ref name=Livneh/>

[[Colchicine]], a drug otherwise mainly used in [[gout]], decreases attack frequency in FMF patients. The exact way in which colchicine suppresses attacks is unclear. While this agent is not without side effects (such as [[abdominal pain]] and [[myalgia|muscle pains]]), it may markedly improve quality of life in patients. The dosage is typically 1–2&nbsp;mg a day. Development of amyloidosis is delayed with colchicine treatment. [[Interferon]] is being studied as a therapeutic modality.<ref name=Livneh/> Some advise discontinuation of colchicine before and during pregnancy, but the data are inconsistent, and others feel it is safe to take colchicine during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michael O, Goldman RD, Koren G |title=Safety of colchicine therapy during pregnancy |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=49 |issue= |pages=967–9 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12943352 |pmc=2214270 |doi= |url=http://www.cfpc.ca/cfp/2003/Aug/vol49-aug-clinical-1.asp}}</ref>. Taking Colchicine for a prolonged period of time may trigger Amyloidosis.

Approximately 5–10% of FMF cases are resistant to colchicine therapy alone. In these cases, adding [[anakinra]] to the daily colchicine regimen has been successful.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The efficacy of anakinra in an adolescent with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | year= 2008 | author=Calligaris L, Marchetti F, Tommasini A, Ventura A | volume = 167 | issue = 6 | pages = 695–696| pmid=17588171 | doi=10.1007/s00431-007-0547-3 | pmc = 2292480}}</ref>

==History==
A [[New York]] allergist, Dr Sheppard Siegal, first described the attacks of [[peritonitis]] in 1945; he termed this "benign paroxysmal peritonitis", as the disease course was essentially benign.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Siegal S|title=Benign paroxysmal peritonitis|journal=Ann Intern Med|year= 1945|volume=23|pages=234–47|pmid=18124924|issue=2}}</ref> Dr Hobart Reimann, working in the [[American University of Beirut|American University in Beirut]], described a more complete picture which he termed "periodic disease".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Reiman HA|title=Periodic disease. Probable syndrome including periodic fever, benign paroxysmal peritonitis, cyclic neutropenia and intermittent arthralgia|journal=J Am Med Assoc|year= 1948|volume=136|pages=239–44|pmid=18920089|issue=4}}</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2503}}</ref>

In 1972, colchicine was discovered to prevent attacks.<ref> {{cite journal | title = Colchicine for familial Mediterranean fever | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | date = 1972-12-21 | first = S.E. | last = Goldfinger | volume = 287 | issue = 25 | pages = 1302| id =  | accessdate = 2012-04-20 | pmid=4636899 | doi=10.1056/NEJM197212212872514}}</ref>

The link to the ''MEFV'' gene was discovered in 1997 by two different groups, each working independently - the French FMF Consortium,<ref name=FConsort>{{cite journal |author=The French FMF Consortium |title=A candidate gene for familial Mediterranean fever |journal=Nat.
