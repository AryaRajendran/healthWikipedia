An '''exudate''' is any [[fluid]] that filters from the [[circulatory system]] into [[lesion]]s or areas of [[inflammation]]. It can apply to plants as well as animals. Its composition varies but generally includes water and the dissolved [[Solution|solutes]] of the main circulatory fluid such as sap or blood. In the case of blood it will contain some or all [[blood protein|plasma proteins]], [[white blood cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and in the case of local [[Blood vessel|vascular]] damage: [[red blood cell]]s. In plants, it can be a healing and defensive response to repel insect attack, or it can be an offensive habit to repel other incompatible or competitive plants. Organisms that feed on exudate are known as exudativores; for example, the [[Vampire Bat]] exhibits [[hematophagy]], and the [[Pygmy marmoset]] is an [[obligate]] gummivore<ref>{{cite book|title=The Smallest Anthropoids: The Marmoset/Callimico Radiation|year=2009|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-1-4419-0293-1|url=http://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0293-1_19|editor=Ford, Susan M.; Porter, Leila M.; Davis, Lesa C.|accessdate=6 October 2012|pages=381–394|quote=The Functional Significance of Jaw-Muscle Fiber Architecture in Tree-Gouging Marmosets}}</ref>  (primarily eats tree gum).

In humans, exudate can be a pus-like or clear fluid. When an injury occurs, leaving skin exposed, it leaks out of the blood vessels and into nearby tissues. The fluid is composed of serum, fibrin, and white blood cells. Exudate may ooze from cuts or from areas of infection or inflammation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002357.htm|title=Exudate|publisher=MedlinePlus}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Exudate is derived from ''exude'', "to ooze,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exuded |title="Exuded" Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-07-04 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Meriam Webster]]}}</ref> from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''exsūdāre'', "to (ooze) out like sweat" (''ex-'' "out" and ''sūdāre'' "to sweat").<ref>{{cite book |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |editor=Robert K. Barnhart |year=1988 |publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers |location=New York |isbn=0-550-14230-4 |page=363}}</ref>

==Types==
* '''Purulent''' or '''suppurative''' exudate consists of plasma with both active and dead [[neutrophils]], [[fibrinogen]], and [[necrotic]] [[parenchymal cells]]. This kind of exudate is consistent with more severe infections, and is commonly referred to as [[pus]].
* '''Fibrinous''' exudate is composed mainly of [[fibrinogen]] and [[fibrin]]. It is characteristic of '''rheumatic carditis''', but is seen in all severe injuries such as [[strep throat]] and [[bacterial pneumonia]]. Fibrinous inflammation is often difficult to resolve due to blood vessels growing into the exudate and filling space that was occupied by fibrin. Often, large amounts of antibiotics are necessary for resolution.
* '''Catarhal''' exudate is seen in the nose and throat and is characterized by a high content of mucus.
* '''Serous''' exudate (sometimes classified as serous [[transudate]]) is usually seen in mild inflammation, with relatively low protein.<ref>Robbins Basic Pathology 7th ed</ref> Its consistency resembles that of serum, and can usually be seen in certain disease states like [[tuberculosis]]. (See below for difference between transudate and exudate)
* '''Malignant''' (or cancerous) pleural effusion is effusion where [[cancer cell]]s are present.<ref>[http://lungcancer.about.com/od/treatmentoflungcancer/a/malignanteffusion.htm About.com > Malignant Pleural Effusion] By Lynne Eldridge MD. Updated March 27, 2010</ref> It is usually classified as exudate.

==Plant exudates==

Plant exudates include [[Plant saps|saps]], [[Natural gum|gums]], [[latex]], [[resin]], and sometimes [[nectar]] is considered an exudate.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Evolution of Exudativory in Primates / Nutritional and Digestive Challenges to Being a Gum-feeding Primate|year=2010|publisher=Springer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YdQg-YoghHEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Power, Michael L.|editor=Anne M. Burrows, Leanne T. Nash|accessdate=2 October 2012|page=28}}</ref>

Plant roots exude a variety of molecules into the [[rhizosphere]], including acids, sugars, polysaccharides and ectoenzymes; this can account for 40% of root carbon.<ref>{{cite book

==Exudates vs. transudates==
{{Transudate vs. exudate}}
There is an important distinction between [[transudates]] and exudates. Transudates are caused by disturbances of [[hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic]] or [[colloid osmotic pressure]], not by inflammation. They have a low protein content in comparison to exudates. Medical distinction between transudates and exudates is through the measurement of the [[specific gravity]] of extracted fluid. Specific gravity is used to measure the protein content of the fluid. The higher the specific gravity, the greater the likelihood of [[capillary]] [[Vascular permeability|permeability]] changes in relation to [[body cavity|body cavities]]. For example, the specific gravity of the transudate is usually less than 1.012 and a protein content of less than 2 gm/100mL (2 gm%). [[Rivalta test]] may be used to differentiate an exudate from a transudate.
It is not clear if there is a distinction in the difference of transudates and exudates in plants.
