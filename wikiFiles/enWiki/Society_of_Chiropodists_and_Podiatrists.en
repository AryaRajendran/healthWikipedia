The '''Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists''' (SCP) is one of the Professional Bodies and a [[trade union]] for registered podiatrists in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

The union originated in 1912 as the '''Society of Chiropodists''', the first organisation of [[chiropodist]]s in Europe.<ref name="foster">Janet Foster and Julia Sheppard, ''British archives: a guide to archive resources in the United Kingdom'', p.384</ref>  In 1916, it was renamed the '''Incorporated Society of Chiropodists''', and in 1919, it established examinations for potential new members.<ref>Gerald Larkin, ''Occupational monopoly and modern medicine'', p.128</ref>

Several rival organisations emerged: the Northern Association of Chiropodists, the Chelsea Chiropodists Association and the British Association of Chiropodists.  These merged with the Incorporated Society in 1945, the new body once more taking the name "Society of Chiropodists".<ref name="foster" />  It was recognised as a negotiating body by the [[National Health Service]] in 1948, but did not register as a trade union until 1978.  In 1993, it took its current name, recognising the membership of [[podiatrist]]s, and in 1997, it affiliated to the [[Trades Union Congress]].<ref>John B. Smethurst and Peter Carter, ''Historical directory of trade unions, Volume 6'', p.439</ref>  In 1998, the Association of Chief Chiropody Officers and the Podiatry Association both merged with the society.<ref>[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/418col.htm Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists 1946-1996], Modern Records Centre, [[University of Warwick]]</ref>
