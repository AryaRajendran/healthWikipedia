'''Focal''' and '''diffuse brain injury''' are ways to classify [[brain injury]]: focal injury occurs in a specific location, while diffuse injury occurs over a more widespread area.  It is common for both focal and diffuse damage to occur as the result of the same event; many traumatic brain injuries have aspects of both focal and diffuse injury.<ref name="Lovell94">

</ref> Focal injuries are commonly associated with an injury in which the head strikes or is struck by an object; diffuse injuries are more often found in [[acceleration]]/deceleration injuries, in which the head does not necessarily contact anything, but brain tissue is damaged because tissue types with varying densities accelerate at different rates.<ref name="Gennarelli04"/>  In addition to [[physical trauma]], other types of [[acquired brain injury|brain injury]], such as [[stroke]], can also produce focal and diffuse injuries.<ref name="Lovell94"/> There may be [[primary and secondary brain injury]] processes.

==Focal==

A focal traumatic injury results from direct mechanical forces (such as occur when the head strikes a windshield in a [[vehicle accident]]) and is usually associated with brain tissue damage visible to the naked eye.<ref name="LaPlaca07">

</ref>  A common cause of focal injury is [[penetrating head injury]], in which the skull is perforated, as frequently occurs in auto accidents, blows, and [[gunshot wound]]s.<ref name="LaPlaca07"/> Focal injuries typically have symptoms that are related to the damaged area of the brain.<ref name="LaPlaca07"/> Stroke can produce focal damage that is associated with signs and symptoms that correspond to the part of the brain that was damaged.<ref name="Lovell94"/>  For example, if a speech center of the brain such as [[Broca's area]] is damaged, problems with speech are common.  

Focal injuries include the following:
*[[Cerebral contusion]] is a bruise of brain tissue that commonly results from contact of the brain with the inside of the skull.<ref name="Granacher07"/>
*[[Cerebral laceration]] is a brain injury in which the [[pia mater|pia]]-[[arachnoid mater|arachnoid]] is torn.<ref name="Granacher07">

*[[Epidural hemorrhage]] is bleeding between the [[dura mater]] and the skull.<ref name="Granacher07"/>  It is commonly associated with damage to the [[middle meningeal artery]], often resulting from a [[skull fracture]].
*[[Subdural hemorrhage]] is bleeding between the dura mater and the arachnoid.<ref name="Granacher07"/>
*[[Intracerebral hemorrhage]] is bleeding within the brain tissue itself.<ref name="Granacher07"/>
*[[Intraventricular hemorrhage]] is bleeding within the [[Ventricular system|ventricle]]s of the brain.<ref name="Granacher07"/>

==Diffuse==

Diffuse injuries, also called '''multifocal injuries''', include brain injury due to [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[meningitis]], and damage to [[blood vessel]]s.<ref name="Gennarelli04">

</ref> these forces are common in diffuse injuries such as [[concussion]] and [[diffuse axonal injury]].  The term "diffuse" has been called a misnomer, since injury is often actually multifocal, with multiple locations of injury.<ref name="Gennarelli04"/>

Diffuse injuries include the following:
*[[Diffuse axonal injury]] is widespread damage to the [[white matter]] of the brain that usually results from acceleration/deceleration types of injury.<ref name="Granacher07"/>
*[[Ischemic]] brain injury resulting from an insufficient blood supply to the brain, is one of the leading causes of [[secondary brain damage]] after head trauma.<ref name="Granacher07"/>
*Vascular injury usually causes death shortly after an injury.<ref name="Granacher07"/>  Although it is diffuse type of brain injury itself, diffuse vascular injury is generally more likely to be caused by focal than diffuse injury.<ref name="Granacher07"/> 
*Swelling, commonly seen after TBI, can lead to dangerous increases in [[intracranial pressure]].<ref name="Granacher07"/>  Though swelling itself is a diffuse type of injury, it can ''result'' from either focal or diffuse injury.<ref name="Granacher07"/>
