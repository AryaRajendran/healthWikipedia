'''Egg allergy''' is a type of [[food allergy]]. It is a [[hypersensitivity]] to [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary substances from the yolk or whites of [[Egg (food)|eggs]], causing an overreaction of the [[immune system]] which may lead to severe physical symptoms for millions of people around the world.<ref>National Institutes of Health, NIAID Allergy Statistics 2005 http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/allergystat.htm</ref>

Egg allergy appears mainly, but not exclusively, in children. In fact, it is the second most common food allergy in children.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.faiusa.org/?page=egg | title = Egg Allergy | accessdate = 12-11-2008| year = 2008| work = | publisher = [[Food Allergy Initiative]] }}</ref>  (The most common is cows' milk allergy.)  It is usually treated with an exclusion [[Dieting|diet]] and vigilant avoidance of foods that may be contaminated with egg.  The most severe food allergy reaction is called [[anaphylaxis]]<ref> National Report of the Expert Panel on Food Allergy Research, NIH-NIAID 2003 http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dait/PDF/june30_2003.pdf</ref> and is an emergency situation requiring immediate attention and treatment with [[Adrenaline|epinephrine]]. The [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]] estimates that most children outgrow egg allergy by the age of five, but some people remain allergic for a lifetime.<ref>[http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=20&cont=523 “Egg Allergy Facts”] Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America</ref>

==Antigens==
Most people who are allergic to hen's eggs have [[antibodies]] which react to one of four proteins in the [[egg white]]:<ref name="isbn3-540-00219-7">{{cite book |author=Thomas Platts-Mills; Ring, Johannes |title=Allergy in Practice |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2005 |isbn=3-540-00219-7 |oclc= |doi= |page=106}}</ref>  [[ovomucoid]], [[ovalbumin]], [[ovotransferrin]], and [[lysozyme]]; ovomucoid, also called ''Gal d 1'', is the most common target of immune system attack.<ref name="isbn3-540-00219-7"/>  The [[egg yolk]] contains several potential antigens:  [[livetin]], [[apovitillin]], and [[vosvetin]].

A person who reacts only to a protein in the egg yolk may be able to easily tolerate egg whites, and vice versa.  Some people will be allergic to proteins in both the egg white and the egg yolk.  Egg yolk allergies may be somewhat more common in adults.<ref name="isbn3-540-00219-7"/> A small number of people who are allergic to eggs will develop an allergy to chicken or other poultry meats.<ref name="isbn3-540-00219-7"/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is generally made through a combination of [[skin prick test]]ing or blood testing and detailed records of all foods and drink the person regularly ingests.

==Treatment==
There is currently no cure for egg allergy.
Most people who are allergic to eggs avoid eating any form of egg or egg component. For people with a more serious allergic reaction to eggs, [[Hives|urticaria]] (hives) and inflammation can occur and as such, doctors suggest that the person carries around an [[EpiPen]].

==Prognosis==
In a study presented at the 2007 [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] (AAAAI) meeting, 50% of patients outgrew egg allergy by age 17. Of those patients who outgrew it, 45% did so by age 5. Children who outgrew the allergy tended to have peak [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] levels at around age one, which then decline.<ref>The Natural History of Egg Allergy  by J. H. Rabe, E. C. Matsui, K. E.

==Vaccine hazard==
The [[Influenza vaccine|flu vaccine]] is typically made using chicken embryo, and as a result the final [[vaccine]] does contain egg proteins. Egg-allergic individuals may react to egg protein(s) in the vaccine (or to gelatin or neomycin if they are allergic to that). If an individual is unable to take the vaccine, vaccinating all other members of their family can help protect them from the [[Influenza|flu]].

Different brands and even individual batches of flu vaccine do vary in their egg protein content. Allergists formerly used skin testing with flu vaccine to predict if receiving the flu shot might be safe, but the results of this type of testing are totally unpredictive and this type of testing should be abandoned. Instead, the age-appropriate immunization material containing the lowest amount of egg proteins should be chosen, then a 1/10 dose should be given followed by a 30 minute observation period in a medical setting fully equipped to treat any possible reaction. Ovalbumin is usually used as a marker for the egg proteins. Vaccines available as recently as 2010 in the US contained up to 21 mcg of ovalbumin per 0.5 mL dose. In 2011 the ovalbumin content varies from less than 5.0 mcg/dose down to less than 0.05 mcg/dose, depending on the brand. One study done on 83 egg allergic patients resulted in a lack of serious reactions at doses of ovalbumin ranging from 0.10 mcg to 0.60 mcg. Thus so some brands available in the US in 2011 are probably safe for most egg allergic patients (administered with caution), but others may not be. For reference modern MMR vaccine (which is generally accepted now to be well tolerated by egg allergic patients, but which is still given with caution) was shown in a 2009 study reported in the BMJ to contain 0.0005 to 0.0010 mcg/dose [0.5 to 1.0 ng/dose).

Egg proteins can also be found in [[yellow fever vaccine]] and [[MMR vaccine]].<ref name="pmid19030254">{{cite journal |author=Romero GL, Kumar S |title=Case 1: The case of the cookie, the rash and the flu vaccine |journal=Paediatr Child Health |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=675–7 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=19030254 |pmc=2528595 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The quantity of egg protein in a dose of MMR vaccine is approximately 40 picograms (much lower than in influenza vaccine, which contains approximately 0.02-1.0&nbsp;micrograms), and this is believed to be associated with a much lower risk.<ref name="urlEgg Allergies : Vaccine Education Center - Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia">{{cite web |url=http://www.chop.edu/consumer/jsp/division/generic.jsp?id=75811 |title=Egg Allergies : Vaccine Education Center - Children's Hospital of Philadelphia |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Cooking without eggs==
In cooking, eggs are multifunctional:  they may act as an [[emulsion|emulsifier]] to reduce oil/water separation (mayonnaise), a binder (water binding and particle adhesion, as in meatloaf), or an aerator (cakes, especially angel food). Some commercial egg replacers can substitute for particular functions ([[potato starch]] and [[tapioca]] for water binding, [[whey protein]] for aeration or particle binding, or soy lecithin for emulsification). For home use, one-half cup of [[applesauce]] can replace one egg in some baking recipes. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Egg white intolerance==
Egg whites, which are potent [[histamine]] liberators, also provoke a nonallergic response in some people.  In this situation, proteins in egg white directly trigger the release of histamine from [[mast cell]]s on contact.<ref name="isbn3-540-20768-6">{{cite book |author=Arnaldo Cantani |title=Pediatric Allergy, Asthma and Immunology |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages=710–713 |isbn=3-540-20768-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-19-514090-7">{{cite book |author=Joris, Isabelle; Majno, Guido |title=Cells, tissues, and disease: principles of general pathology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004 |pages=538 |isbn=0-19-514090-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Because this mechanism is classified as a pharmacological reaction, or "[[pseudoallergy]]",<ref name="isbn3-540-20768-6" /> the condition is considered a [[food intolerance]] instead of a true IgE-based [[allergic reaction]].

The response is usually localized, typically in the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="isbn3-540-20768-6" />  Symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any symptoms of histamine release. If sufficiently strong, it can result in an [[pseudoanaphylaxis|anaphylactoid reaction]], which is clinically indistinguishable from true [[anaphylaxis]].<ref name="isbn0-19-514090-7" />

Some people with this condition tolerate small quantities of egg whites.<ref name="isbn1-4051-7036-0">{{cite book |author=Carina Venter; Isabel Skypala |title=Food Hypersensitivity: Diagnosing and Managing Food Allergies and Intolerance |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2009 |pages=129–131 |isbn=1-4051-7036-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  They are more often able to tolerate well-cooked eggs, such as found in cake or dried egg-based pasta, than loosely cooked eggs, such as fried eggs or meringues, or uncooked eggs.<ref name="isbn1-4051-7036-0" />
