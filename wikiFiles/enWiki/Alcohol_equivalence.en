'''Alcohol equivalence''' is a system of [[Standard drink|standard drink sizes]] of various [[alcoholic beverage]]s. The amount of alcohol (i.e., [[ethanol]]) that is contained in a standard drink varies widely by country.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand one standard drink, as defined by the Alcohol Advisory Council, contains 10 grams of [[ethyl alcohol]] which is approximately 12.7 mL. {{note|Assuming a density of 0.789 g / mL.}} This is approximately "a 330ml can of beer or a 100ml glass of table wine or a 30ml glass of straight spirits".<ref>http://www.alac.org.nz/alcohol-you/whats-standard-drink/guide-standard-drinks</ref>

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, one standard drink or "unit" of alcohol is defined as  10ml or 8g of pure alcohol. This equals one 25ml single measure of spirits,(ABV 40%), or a third of a pint of beer (ABV 5-6%), or half a standard (175ml) glass of red wine (ABV 12%).<ref>http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/facts/frequently-asked-questions#what_is_unit</ref>

==United States==
In the United States, a standard drink is defined as 0.6 [[fluid ounce]] (18 mL or 14 g) of pure alcohol.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Alcohol and Public Health. What is a standard drink in the United States?]</ref> In the United States, therefore, one standard drink is contained in:

* a 12-ounce bottle or can of typical (5% [[ABV]]) beer
* a 5-ounce glass of typical (12% ABV) wine
* a 1.5-ounce [[shot glass|shot]] of 80-[[alcoholic proof|proof]] (40% ABV) [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] (either straight or in a [[mixed drink]])

Alcohol equivalence is emphasized as being important for [[Drinking#Alcoholic beverages|drinking]] in moderation by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA), [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] (DOT), [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS), [[American Dietetic Association]], [[National Consumers League]], [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] (NCADD), and [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD).
