The '''semitendinosus''' is a [[muscle]] in the [[Posterior compartment of thigh|back of the]] [[thigh]]; it is one of the [[hamstring]]s.

==Structure==
The semitendinosus, remarkable for the great length of its [[tendon]] of insertion, is situated at the posterior and medial aspect of the [[thigh]].

It arises from the lower and medial impression on the [[Tuberosity of the ischium|tuberosity of the]] [[ischium]], by a tendon common to it and the long head of the [[biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]; it also arises from an [[aponeurosis]] which connects the adjacent surfaces of the two muscles to the extent of about 7.5 cm. from their origin.

The muscle is [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] and ends a little below the middle of the thigh in a long round tendon which lies along the medial side of the [[popliteal fossa]]; it then curves around the [[Medial condyle of tibia|medial condyle]] of the [[tibia]] and passes over the [[medial collateral ligament]] of the [[knee|knee-joint]], from which it is separated by a [[bursa (anatomy)|bursa]], and is inserted into the upper part of the medial surface of the [[Body of tibia|body of the tibia]], nearly as far forward as its anterior crest.

At its insertion it gives off from its lower border a prolongation to the deep fascia of the leg and lies behind the tendon of the [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]], and below that of the [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]], to which it is united.  These three tendons form what is known as the [[pes anserinus]], so named because it looks like the foot of a goose.

A tendinous intersection is usually observed about the middle of the muscle.

==Innervation==
A [[lower motor neuron]] exits to the [[sacral plexus]] exiting through the spinal levels L5-S2.  From the sacral plexus, the lower motor neuron travels down the [[sciatic nerve]].<ref name="Saladin2010">Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: the unity of form and function. 5th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010. Print.</ref>  The sciatic nerve branches into the deep fibular nerve and the tibial nerve.  The tibial nerve innervates the semitendinosus as well as the other hamstring muscles, the [[semimembranosus]] and [[biceps femoris]].<ref>Agur, Anne M. R., Arthur F. Dalley, and J. C. Boileau Grant. Grant's Atlas of Anatomy. Philadelphia: Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2013. Print.</ref>

==Actions==
The semitendinosus helps to [[Extension (kinesiology)|extend]] (straighten) the [[hip|hip joint]] and [[flexion|flex]] (bend) the [[knee|knee joint]].  It also helps [[internal rotation|medially rotate]] the tibia on the femur when the knee is flexed and medially rotate the femur when the hip is extended.  It counteracts forward bending at the hips as well.<ref name="Saladin2010">Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: the unity of form and function. 5th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010. Print.</ref>
