==Challenges by states==
[[File:PPACA States Lawsuit.svg|thumb|right|300px|States (in red) challenging the constitutionality of PPACA]]
Organizations and lawmakers who opposed the passage of the bill threatened to take legal action against it upon its passage<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/22/health-care-face-string-legal-challenges/|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-22|title=Health Care Bill Could Face String of Legal Challenges}}</ref> and several court challenges are currently at various stages of development. The target of the threatened lawsuits were several key provisions of the bill. Some claimed that fining individuals for failing to buy insurance is not within the scope of Congress's taxing powers. Idaho legislators passed a law that directed its attorney general to sue if mandatory insurance becomes federal law, which he duly did. A total of 28&nbsp;states filed joint or individual lawsuits (including [[Florida et al v. United States Department of Health and Human Services|26 states engaged in a joint action]]) to overturn the individual mandate portions of the law.<ref>{{cite web|last=Danielson |first=Dar |url=http://www.radioiowa.com/2011/01/18/iowa-governor-signs-onto-florida-lawsuit-against-federal-health-care/ |title=Iowa governor signs onto Florida lawsuit against federal health care |publisher=Radio Iowa |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=idahostatemen>{{cite news|url=http://www.teamiha.org/Documents/IHANews/0318%20Medical%20insurance%20refusal.pdf|title=Otter is the first governor to sign a law saying the state will defy a requirement to buy insurance|newspaper=[[Idaho Statesman]]|accessdate=2010-03-22|date=March 18, 2010|author=Murphy, Brian}}</ref><ref name=idahostatemen/><ref name=Go123332odhue0322>{{cite web|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7018174697?Attoneys%20General%20Sue%20To%20Stop%20Health%20Care%20Bill|title=Attoneys General Sue To Stop Health Care Bill|author=Goodhue, David|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=2010-03-22|publisher=[[All Headline News]]}}</ref><ref name=csmoniteratg>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0322/Attorneys-general-in-11-states-poised-to-challenge-healthcare-bill|title=Attorneys general in 11 states poised to challenge healthcare bill|author=Richey, Warren|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=2010-03-22|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref><ref name=apcasestory>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-03-23-attorneys-general-health-suit_N.htm|title=13 attorneys general sue over health care overhaul|agency=Associated Press|author=Farrington, Brendan|date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-14|work=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36001783/ns/politics-health_care_reform/|title=State attorneys general sue over health bill|date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=2010-03-23|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|author=Williams, Pete}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Update 3-Florida says challenge to healthcare reform widens|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN079896320100407 |date=April 7, 2010|last=Fletcher|first=Pascal|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> In a press release, the Attorneys General for several states indicated their primary basis for the challenge was a violation of state sovereignty.

==Reactions from legal experts==

In February 2011, Alexander Bolton wrote in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' that consensus among legal experts largely changed following Judge [[Roger Vinson]]'s decision in ''[[Florida et al v. United States Department of Health and Human Services]]''. He said that prior to the ruling, it was widely felt that the Supreme Court would uphold the law by a comfortable margin, but now legal scholars generally feel it would be a 5–4 decision. [[Georgetown University Law Center]] professor [[Randy Barnett]] said, "There's been a big change in the conventional wisdom ... the temperature of law professors has changed considerably," and described the ''Florida'' decision as "extremely deep in its discussion of principles and constitutional doctrine".<ref name=Bolton>{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Lawmakers press Supreme Court for verdict on healthcare law|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/141631-lawmakers-press-court-for-verdict|accessdate=July 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=February 2, 2011}}</ref>

==Lower federal courts (prior to the Supreme Court's decision)==
===District Court for the Northern District of Florida and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit===
On January 31, 2011, Judge [[Roger Vinson]] in ''[[Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human Services]]'' declared the law unconstitutional in an action brought by 26&nbsp;states, on the grounds that the [[health insurance mandate|individual mandate]] to purchase insurance exceeds the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Vinson further ruled the clause was not severable, which had the effect of striking down the entire law.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Tom |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/31/us-usa-healthcare-ruling-idUSTRE70U6RY20110131 |title=Judge strikes down healthcare reform law |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=David Whelan |url=http://blogs.forbes.com/davidwhelan/2011/01/31/breaking-news-florida-judge-rules-against-obamacare-individual-mandate-unconstitutional/ |title=Florida Judge Rules Against ObamaCare, Calls Individual Mandate Unconstitutional |publisher=Blogs.forbes.com |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref>

On August 12, 2011, a divided three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Vinson's decision in part: the court agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional, but held that it could be severed, allowing the rest of the PPACA to remain.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904006104576504383685080762.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Brent | last=Kendall | title=Health Overhaul Is Dealt Setback | date=August 13, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2011, the Department of Justice decided not to ask for an [[en banc]] review by the 11th Circuit, and instead asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yost|first=Pete|title=Govt won't seek appeal in Atlanta on health care|url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/Govt-won-t-seek-appeal-in-Atlanta-on-health-care-2189795.php|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 26, 2011|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Stephanie |last=Cutter |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/28/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-hear-health-care-lawsuit |title=Obama Administration Asks Supreme Court to Hear Health Care Lawsuit |publisher=The White House |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> On November 14, 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.<ref name=SCblog20111114>{{cite news|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|title=Court sets 5 1/2-hour hearing on health care|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/11/court-sets-5-12-hour-hearing-on-health-care/|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|date=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

===District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit===

Almost immediately after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Virginia state legislature passed a law that purported to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] the individual mandate provision of the federal Act.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sampson |first=Zinie Chen |title=Va. AG sues over federal health care overhaul |accessdate=20 December 2010 |publisher=''[[Businessweek]]'' |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9EKHKK00.htm |date=23 March 2010}}</ref> [[Virginia]] [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]] [[Ken Cuccinelli]] then sued [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Kathleen Sebelius]] in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]]. Cuccinelli's lawsuit was separate from the states participating in Florida's lawsuit. The case was heard by Judge [[Henry E. Hudson]], who was appointed to the bench by [[George W. Bush]].

On May 24, 2010, the [[Obama administration]] filed a [[Involuntary dismissal|motion to dismiss]] the lawsuit, arguing that states cannot escape federal law simply by passing state laws that contravene federal ones.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Bob|title=Feds Ask Va.

The Obama administration appealed the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]], which granted a request from both parties for an expedited process. On February 3, 2011, Cuccinelli announced that he intended to file an appeal directly with the Supreme Court, bypassing the Court of Appeals; this request was denied by the Supreme Court on April 25.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704376104576122593647702576.html | title=Health Foes Try Divergent Tactics | accessdate=2011-02-06 | author=Kendall, Brent | date=2011-02-04 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref> Hearings were held on May 10, 2011, and May 13, 2011, in Richmond.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/Global/story.asp?S=13916155|title=Appeals Court Expedites Health Care Lawsuit|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=27 January 2011|publisher=NBC29}}</ref>

In September 8, 2011, the appellate court reversed Hudson's decision, in a decision issued by Judge [[Diana Gribbon Motz]]. The Fourth Circuit panel ruled that Virginia lacked [[subject-matter jurisdiction]]. The state law that was the basis of Cuccinelli's lawsuit was deemed invalid because Virginia lacks the authority to supersede or override federal law. Simply creating a law to use as a smokescreen for the guise of challenging a federal law did not constitute standing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.liberty.edu/media/9980/attachments/opinion_healthcare_4th_va_v_sebelius_090811.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fourth Circuit of Appeals Decision | accessdate=2011-09-08 | author=Diana Gribbon Motz | date=2011-09-08}}</ref>

On September 30, 2011, Virginia requested that the Supreme Court issue certiorari to hear the case. The petition was denied on June 29, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Cases 11-1057, 11-1058|url={{SCOTUS URL Docket|11-420}}}}</ref>

===District Court for the Western District of Virginia===
On November 30, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge [[Norman K. Moon]], who sits in Virginia, also declared the individual mandate constitutional in ''[[Liberty University v. Geithner]]''. He also declared the employer mandate constitutional. He rejected two other arguments that government lawyers have made in cases across the country in defending the new law: first, that no one has legal standing to bring challenges at this point to the 2014 mandates, and second that any such challenge is premature. He rejected the challengers' basic argument that Congress had no authority to order someone to give up their own desire not to buy a commercial product and force them into a market they do not want to enter. He said:{{Quote|Regardless of whether one relies on an insurance policy, one's savings, or the backstop of free or reduced-cost emergency room services, one has made a choice regarding the method of payment for the health care services one expects to receive. Far from "inactivity", by choosing to forgo insurance, [individuals] are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later, out of pocket, rather than now, through the purchase of insurance ... As Congress found, the total incidence of these economic decisions has a substantial impact on the national market for health care by collectively shifting billions of dollars on to other market participants and driving up the prices of insurance policies.<ref>Denniston, Lyle (December 1, 2010).

===District Court for the District of Columbia===
On February 22, 2011, Judge [[Gladys Kessler]] of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, rejected a challenge to the law in ''[[Mead v. Holder]]'' by five individuals who argued, among other things, that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act violated the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], and that the individual mandate exceeded Congress's power under the Interstate Commerce Clause. Kessler rejected as "pure semantics" plaintiffs' argument that failing to acquire insurance was the regulation of inactivity, noting that "those who choose not to purchase health insurance will ultimately get a 'free ride' on the backs of those Americans who have made responsible choices to provide for the illness we all must face at some point in our lives." Kessler ruled that individual mandate was a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.<ref name=doj_aca>{{cite web |url= http://www.justice.gov/healthcare/|title=Defending the Affordable Care Act|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=2011-02-24 }}</ref><ref name=kessler32>{{Cite news|url= http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/02/third-federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law-score-now-3-2.html|title=Third Federal Judge Upholds Health Care Law; Score Now 3–2|publisher=ABC News |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref>

Judge [[Brett Kavanaugh]] dissented, stating that the [[Tax Anti-Injunction Act]] precluded the court from hearing the case until after the individual mandate took effect. It was reported that the Supreme Court might attempt to follow Kavanaugh's opinion had they wished to hold off on deciding the issue. The Supreme Court indeed heard oral arguments regarding the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, ultimately unanimously ruling (though with differing rationales) that it did not apply to this case.

==U.S. Supreme Court==
{{Main|National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius|}}

On November 14, 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a [[writ of certiorari]] to the United States Appeals Court for the Eleventh Circuit to consider appeals to its rulings in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' and ''[[Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human Services]]''. The Court heard oral arguments March 26–28, 2012 and decided the consolidated case on June 28, 2012.  Though the Supreme Court declared that the Commerce Clause did not protect the law, and that under that justification it was not constitutional, the Court declared that the legislatively-declared "penalty" was constitutional as it would more properly be construed as a tax collected under Congress's taxing power, thus upholding the individual mandate.  The Court also limited the expansion of Medicaid initially proposed under the PPACA. All provisions of the PPACA will continue to be in effect, with some limits on the Medicaid expansion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Analysis: U.S. Supreme Court Upholds the Affordable Care Act: Roberts Rules? |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/analysis-us-supreme-court-upholds-affordable-care-act-roberts-rules |publisher=von Briesen & Roper, S.C. |work=The National Law Review|date=2012-06-29|accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref>

Despite the Court's holding in ''NFIB v. Sebelius'', opponents of the legislation continued to pursue litigation in order to defeat the Affordable Care Act. The Pacific Legal Foundation initiated a lawsuit (''Sissel v. U.S. Dept. Health & Human Services'') in D.C. Circuit Court claiming that the act is still unconstitutional, even in light of the "saving construction" given the law in ''NFIB v.
