An '''opioid''' is a psychoactive chemical that works by binding to [[opioid receptor]]s, which are found principally in the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] and the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. The receptors in these organ systems mediate both the beneficial effects and the [[adverse effect|side effects]] of opioids.

Opioids are among the world's oldest known [[drug]]s; the therapeutic use of the [[opium poppy]] predates [[recorded history]]. The [[analgesic]] (painkiller) effects of opioids are due to decreased perception of pain, decreased reaction to pain as well as increased pain tolerance. The side effects of opioids include [[sedation]], [[respiratory depression]], [[constipation]], and a strong sense of [[euphoria]]. Opioids can cause cough suppression, which can be both an indication for opioid administration or an unintended side effect. [[Opioid dependence]] can develop with ongoing administration, leading to a [[Opioid dependence#Symptoms of withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]] with abrupt discontinuation. Opioids are well known for their ability to produce a feeling of euphoria, motivating some to [[Recreational drug use|recreationally use]] opioids.

Although the term ''[[opiate]]'' is often used as a synonym for ''opioid'', the term ''opiate'' is properly limited to the natural [[alkaloid]]s found in the resin of the [[opium poppy]] ''(Papaver somniferum)''.  In some definitions, the semi-synthetic substances that are directly derived from the opium poppy are considered to be opiates as well, while in other classification systems these substances are simply referred to as semi-synthetic opioids.

==Medical uses==

===Pain===
Opioids have long been used to treat acute [[pain]] (such as post-operative pain). They have also been found to be invaluable in [[palliative care]] to alleviate the severe, chronic, disabling pain of terminal conditions such as [[cancer]], and degenerative conditions such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. However, opioids should be used cautiously in chronic non-cancer pain (see below). High doses are not necessarily required to control the pain of advanced or end-stage disease. Tolerance (a physical reaction which makes the body less responsive to analgesic and other effects of opiates) may occur. Requirements can level off for many months at a time, depending on severity of pain, which varies.  This is despite the fact that opioids have potential for tolerance, which essentially means in many cases opioids are a successful long-term care strategy for those in chronic [[cancer pain]].

In recent years there has been an increased use of opioids in the management of non-malignant [[chronic pain]]. This practice has now led to a new and growing problem with addiction and misuse of opioids.<ref name="Okie S (2010)">{{cite journal |author=Okie S |title=A flood of opioids, a rising tide of deaths |journal=N.

===Opioid comparison===
{{Main|Opioid comparison}}
When switching opioids doctors first have to find an equivalent dose based on the patient's current dosage. An [[equianalgesic]] chart is used to find the proper dosage upon switching a medication.

Infrequent adverse reactions in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression (especially with more [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] opioids), confusion, [[hallucinations]], [[delirium]], [[urticaria]], [[hypothermia]], [[bradycardia]]/[[tachycardia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], dizziness, headache, urinary retention, ureteric or biliary spasm, muscle rigidity, myoclonus (with high doses), and flushing (due to histamine release, except fentanyl and remifentanil).<ref name="oxford" />

[[Opioid-induced hyperalgesia]] has been observed in some patients, whereby individuals using opioids to relieve pain may [[paradoxically]] experience more pain as a result of their medication. This phenomenon, although uncommon, is seen in some [[palliative care]] patients, most often when dose is escalated rapidly.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14649563 | volume=20 | issue=6 | title=Morphine hyperalgesia: a case report | year=2003 | author=Wilson GR, Reisfield GM | journal=Am J Hosp Palliat Care | pages=459–61 | doi = 10.1177/104990910302000608}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Vella-Brincat J, Macleod AD | year = 2007 | title = Adverse effects of opioids on the central nervous systems of palliative care patients | url = | journal = J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 15–25 | pmid = 17430825 | doi = 10.1080/J354v21n01_05 }}</ref> If encountered, rotation between several different opioid analgesics may mitigate the development of [[hyperalgesia]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16082916 | volume=22 | issue=4 | title=Hyperalgesia and opioid switching | year=2005 | author=Mercadante S, Arcuri E | journal=Am J Hosp Palliat Care | pages=291–4 | doi = 10.1177/104990910502200411}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15364634 | volume=18 | issue=3 | title=Opioid insights:opioid-induced hyperalgesia and opioid rotation | year=2004 | author=Fine PG | journal=J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother | pages=75–9 | doi = 10.1080/J354v18n03_08}}</ref>

Both therapeutic and chronic use of opioids can compromise the function of the [[immune system]].  Opioids decrease the proliferation of [[macrophage]] progenitor cells and [[lymphocyte]]s, and affect cell differentiation (Roy & Loh, 1996).  Opioids may also inhibit [[leukocyte]] migration.  However the relevance of this in the context of pain relief is not known.

Men who are taking moderate to high doses of an opioid analgesic long-term are likely to have subnormal testosterone levels, which can lead to osteoporosis and decreased muscle strength if left untreated. Therefore, total and free testosterone levels should be monitored in these patients; if levels are suboptimal, testosterone replacement therapy, preferably with patches or transdermal preparations, should be given. Also, prostate-specific antigen levels should be monitored.<ref name="musculoskeletalnetwork.com">Schneider JP.

===Managing adverse effects===
[[Nausea]]: tolerance occurs within 7–10 days, during which antiemetics (e.g. low dose [[haloperidol]] once at night) are very effective.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is currently rarely used. A related drug, Compazine (prochlorperazine) is more often used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as [[ondansetron]] or [[tropisetron]] may be indicated if nausea is severe or continues for an extended period, although these tend to be avoided due to their high cost unless nausea is really problematic. A cheaper alternative is dopamine antagonists, e.g. domperidone and metoclopramide. [[Domperidone]] does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], so blocks opioid emetic action in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] without adverse central anti-dopaminergic effects (not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anti-cholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation anti-histamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties.
*5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists (e.g. [[ondansetron]])
*Dopamine antagonists (e.g. [[domperidone]])
*Anti-cholinergic antihistamines (e.g. [[diphenhydramine]])

[[Vomiting]]: this is due to [[gastric stasis]] (large volume vomiting, brief nausea relieved by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] of the [[area postrema]], the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (e.g. [[domperidone]] or [[metoclopramide]] 10&nbsp;mg every eight hours). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (e.g. subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for domperidone).
*Prokinetic agents (e.g. [[domperidone]])
*Anti-cholinergic agents (e.g. [[orphenadrine]])

[[Drowsiness]]: tolerance usually develops over 5–7 days, but if troublesome, switching to an alternative opioid often helps. Certain opioids such as [[fentanyl]], [[morphine]] and [[diamorphine]] (heroin) tend to be particularly sedating, while others such as [[oxycodone]], [[tilidine]] and [[meperidine]] (pethidine) tend to produce comparatively less sedation, but individual patients responses can vary markedly and some degree of trial and error may be needed to find the most suitable drug for a particular patient. Treatment is at any rate possible - [[Central Nervous System|CNS]] [[stimulants]] are generally effective.
*Stimulants (e.g. [[caffeine]], [[modafinil]], [[amphetamine]], [[methylphenidate]])

[[Itching]]: tends not to be a severe problem when opioids are used for pain relief, but if required then [[antihistamine]]s are useful for counteracting itching. Non-sedating antihistamines such as fexofenadine are preferable so as to avoid increasing opioid induced drowsiness, although some sedating antihistamines such as orphenadrine may be helpful as they produce a synergistic analgesic effect which allows smaller doses of opioids to be used while still producing effective analgesia. For this reason some opioid/antihistamine combination products have been marketed, such as Meprozine ([[meperidine]]/[[promethazine]]) and Diconal ([[dipipanone]]/[[cyclizine]]), which may also have the added advantage of reducing nausea as well.
*Antihistamines (e.g. [[fexofenadine]])

[[Constipation]]: develops in many people on opioids and since tolerance to this problem does not develop readily, most patients on long-term opioids will need a laxative. Over 30 years experience in palliative care has shown that most opioid constipation can be successfully prevented: "Constipation … is treated [with laxatives and stool-softeners]" (Burton 2004, 277).  According to Abse, "It is very important to watch out for constipation, which can be severe" and "can be a very considerable complication" (Abse 1982, 129) if it is ignored. Peripherally acting opioid antagonists such as [[alvimopan]] (Entereg) and [[methylnaltrexone]] (Relistor) have been found to effectively relieve opioid induced constipation without triggering withdrawal symptoms, although alvimopan is contraindicated in patients who have taken opioids for more than seven days, is only FDA-approved for 15 doses or less, and may increase risk of heart attack.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McNicol ED, Boyce D, Schumann R, Carr DB |title=Mu-opioid antagonists for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD006332 |year=2008 |pmid=18425947 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006332.pub2 |editor1-last=McNicol |editor1-first=Ewan D }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Portenoy RK |title=Subcutaneous methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose-ranging study |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=458–68 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18440447 |doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.12.005 |author-separator=, |author2=Thomas J |author3=Moehl Boatwright ML |display-authors=3 |last4=Tran |first4=Diep |last5=Galasso |first5=Frank L. |last6=Stambler |first6=Nancy |last7=Von Gunten |first7=Charles F. |last8=Israel |first8=Robert J. }}</ref>
For mild cases, a lot of water (around 1.5 L/day) and fiber might suffice (in addition to the laxative and stool-softeners).
*Stool-softening and peristalsis-promoting [[laxatives]] (e.g. [[docusate]] in combination with [[bisacodyl]] or senna).
*Peripherally-acting opioid antagonists (e.g. [[methylnaltrexone]]) effectively prevent constipation while not affecting centrally mediated analgesia or provoking withdrawal syndrome, however these can still potentially reduce the efficacy of opioid analgesics in the treatment of conditions where much of the pain relief comes from action at peripherally situated opioid receptors, such as in inflammatory conditions like [[arthritis]] or post-[[surgery|surgical]] pain.
*High water intake and [[dietary fiber]]
For more severe and/or chronic cases, the drugs that are used work by not increasing peristalsis, but by preventing water uptake in the intestine, leading to a softer stool with a larger component of water, and, additionally, by acidifying the environment inside the intestine, which both decreases water uptake and enhances peristalsis (e.g. lactulose, which is controversially noted as a possible [[probiotic]]). The following drugs are generally efficacious:
*[[Polyethylene glycol]] 3350±10% [[dalton (unit)|dalton]] powder for solution (MiraLax, GlycoLax).
*[[Lactulose]] syrup

One combination, [[oxycodone/naloxone]], aims to reduce systemic side effects by combining oxycodone with an opioid suppressor, naloxone, in a form which does not pass through the [[blood–brain barrier]]. Thus, the constipation effect is suppressed, but not the pain reduction. 

[[Respiratory depression]]: although this is the most serious adverse reaction associated with opioid use it usually is seen with the use of a single, intravenous dose in an opioid-naïve patient.  In patients taking opioids regularly for pain relief, tolerance to respiratory depression occurs rapidly, so that it is not a clinical problem. Several drugs have been developed which can partially block respiratory depression, although the only respiratory stimulant currently approved for this purpose is [[doxapram]], which has only limited efficacy in this application.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yost CS |title=A new look at the respiratory stimulant doxapram |journal=CNS Drug Rev |volume=12 |issue=3–4 |pages=236–49 |year=2006 |pmid=17227289 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-3458.2006.00236.x |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16939923 | volume=26 | issue=8 | title=[Clinical observation of target-controlled remifentanil infusion combined with propofol and doxapram in painless artificial abortion] | year=2006 | month=August | author=Tan ZM, Liu JH, Dong T, Li JX | journal=Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao | pages=1206–8}}</ref> Newer drugs such as [[BIMU-8]] and [[CX-546]] may however be much more effective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Manzke T, Guenther U, Ponimaskin E, Haller M, Dutschmann M, Schwarzacher S, Richter D |title=5-HT4(a) receptors avert opioid-induced breathing depression without loss of analgesia |journal=Science |volume=301 |issue=5630 |pages=226–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12855812 |doi=10.1126/science.1084674}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang X, Dergacheva O, Kamendi H, Gorini C, Mendelowitz D |title=5-Hydroxytryptamine 1A/7 and 4alpha receptors differentially prevent opioid-induced inhibition of brain stem cardiorespiratory function |journal=Hypertension |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=368–76 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17576856 |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.091033 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ren J, Poon BY, Tang Y, Funk GD, Greer JJ |title=Ampakines alleviate respiratory depression in rats |journal=Am.

* Respiratory stimulants: carotid chemoreceptor agonists (e.g. [[doxapram]]), 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonists (e.g. [[BIMU8]]), δ-opioid agonists (e.g. [[BW373U86]]) and AMPAkines (e.g. [[CX717]]) can all reduce respiratory depression caused by opioids without affecting analgesia, but most of these drugs are only moderately effective or have side effects which preclude use in humans. 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonists such as [[8-OH-DPAT]] and [[repinotan]] also counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression, but at the same time reduce analgesia, which limits their usefulness for this application.
*Opioid antagonists (e.g. [[naloxone]], [[nalmefene]], [[diprenorphine]])

[[Hyperalgesia]]: side effects such as hyperalgesia and [[allodynia]], sometimes accompanied by a worsening of [[neuropathic pain]], may be consequences of long-term treatment with opioid analgesics, especially when increasing tolerance has resulted in loss of efficacy and consequent progressive dose escalation over time. This appears to largely be a result of actions of opioid drugs at targets other than the three classic opioid receptors, including the [[nociceptin receptor]], [[sigma receptor]] and [[Toll-like receptor 4]], and can be counteracted in animal models by antagonists at these targets such as [[J-113,397]], [[BD-1047]] or [[(+)-Naloxone]] respectively.<ref name="pmid17617400">{{cite journal |author=Wu HE, Hong JS, Tseng LF |title=Stereoselective action of (+)-morphine over (−)-morphine in attenuating the (−)-morphine-produced antinociception via the naloxone-sensitive sigma receptor in the mouse |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=571 |issue=2–3 |pages=145–51 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17617400 |pmc=2080825 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.06.012 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid20021351">{{cite journal |author=Díaz JL, Zamanillo D, Corbera J, Baeyens JM, Maldonado R, Pericàs MA, Vela JM, Torrens A |title=Selective sigma-1 (sigma1) receptor antagonists: emerging target for the treatment of neuropathic pain |journal=Central Nervous System Agents in Medicinal Chemistry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=172–83 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=20021351 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19833175">{{cite journal |author=Lewis SS, Hutchinson MR, Rezvani N, Loram LC, Zhang Y, Maier SF, Rice KC, Watkins LR |title=Evidence that intrathecal morphine-3-glucuronide may cause pain enhancement via toll-like receptor 4/MD-2 and interleukin-1β |journal=Neuroscience |volume=165 |issue=2 |pages=569–83 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=19833175 |pmc=2795035 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.10.011 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid20067813">{{cite journal |author=Scoto GM, Aricò G, Iemolo A, Ronsisvalle G, Parenti C |title=Selective inhibition of the NOP receptor in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray attenuates the development and the expression of tolerance to morphine-induced antinociception in rats |journal=Peptides |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=696–700 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20067813 |doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2009.12.028 |url=}}</ref> No drugs are currently approved specifically for counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia in humans and in severe cases the only solution may be to discontinue use of opioid analgesics and replace them with non-opioid analgesic drugs.

*[[NMDA antagonist]]s such as [[ketamine]]

*[[anticonvulsant]]s such as [[gabapentin]] or [[pregabalin]]

Finally, opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be reversed with an [[opioid antagonist]] such as [[naloxone]] or [[naltrexone]].  These [[competitive antagonist]]s bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but do not activate the receptors.  This displaces the agonist, attenuating and/or reversing the agonist effects.  However, the [[elimination half-life]] of naloxone can be shorter than that of the opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as [[nalmefene]] may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.

===Safety===

Carefully titrating the dose of opioids can provide for effective pain relief while minimizing adverse effects. Morphine and diamorphine have been shown to have a wider therapeutic range or "safety margin" than some other opioids. It is impossible to tell which patients need low doses and which need high doses, so all have to be started on low doses, unless changing from another strong opioid.<ref name="TextbookPalliativeMedicine">''Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine'', 3rd ed. (Doyle D, Hanks G, Cherney I and Calman K, eds. Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref>

According to a cohort study, the rate of opioid related death was 0.017% per year amongst patients prescribed opioids for non-cancer pain from 1997-2005 in Washington State.  Increasing dose and age were found to correlate with increased risk of overdose.<ref>Dunn KM, Saunders KW, Rutter CM, Banta-Green CJ, Merrill JO, Sullivan MD, Weisner CM, Silverberg MJ, Campbell CI, Psaty BM, Von Korff M.

===Tolerance===
''[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]]'' is the process whereby [[neural adaptation|neuroadaptation]] occurs (through receptor desensitization) resulting in reduced drug effects. Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs quickly to the effects on mood, itching, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, but occurs more slowly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. However, tolerance does not develop to constipation or [[miosis]] (the constriction of the pupil of the eye to less than or equal to two millimeters). This idea has been challenged, however, with some authors arguing that tolerance ''does'' develop to miosis.<ref>http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/fulltext/2005/03000/tolerance_to_miotic_effects_of_opioids.47.aspx</ref>

Tolerance is a physiologic process where the body adjusts to a medication that is frequently present, usually requiring higher doses of the same medication over time to achieve the same effect. It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction. 

[[Substance dependence|Dependence]] is characterised by unpleasant withdrawal symptoms that occur if opioid use is abruptly discontinued. The withdrawal symptoms for opiates include severe [[dysphoria]], [[sweating]], [[nausea]], [[rhinorrea]], depression, severe [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[vomiting]] and [[pain]]. Slowly reducing the intake of opioids over days and weeks will reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms.<ref name="TextbookPalliativeMedicine" /> The speed and severity of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid; heroin and morphine withdrawal occur more quickly and are more severe than [[methadone]] withdrawal, but methadone withdrawal takes longer. The acute withdrawal phase is often followed by a protracted phase of depression and insomnia that can last for months. The symptoms of opioid withdrawal can also be treated with other medications, such as [[clonidine]], [[antidepressant]]s and [[benzodiazepine]]s, but with a low efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hermann D, Klages E, Welzel H, Mann K, Croissant B |title=Low efficacy of non-opioid drugs in opioid withdrawal symptoms |journal=Addict Biol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=165–9 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=16191669 |doi=10.1080/13556210500123514 }}</ref> Physical dependence does not predict drug misuse or true addiction, and is closely related to the same mechanism as tolerance.

===Addiction===
{{See also|Opioid dependence}}
''[[Drug addiction|Addiction]]'' is the process whereby physical and/or psychological dependence develops to a drug - including opioids.   The withdrawal symptoms can reinforce the addiction, driving the user to continue taking the drug.  Psychological addiction is more common in people insufflating or injecting opioids recreationally rather than taking them orally for medical reasons.<ref name="TextbookPalliativeMedicine" />
In European nations such as Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, slow release oral morphine formulations are used in opiate substitution therapy for patients who do not well tolerate the side effects of buprenorphine or methadone. In other European countries including the UK, this is also legally used for OST although on a varying scale of acceptance.

===Recreational use===
''[[Drug misuse]]'' is the use of drugs for reasons other than what the drug was prescribed for. Opioids are primarily misused due to their ability to produce [[euphoria]]. Misuse can also include giving drugs to people for whom it was not prescribed or selling the medication, both of which are crimes punishable by jail time in some, if not most, countries.

Opioids bind to specific [[opioid receptor]]s in the [[nervous system]] and other tissues.  There are three principal classes of opioid receptors, [[mu opioid receptor|μ]], [[kappa opioid receptor|κ]], [[delta opioid receptor|δ]] (mu, kappa, and delta), although up to seventeen have been reported, and  include the ε, ι, λ, and ζ (Epsilon, Iota, Lambda and Zeta) receptors.  Conversely, σ ([[sigma receptor|Sigma]]) receptors are no longer considered to be opioid receptors because: their activation is not reversed by the opioid inverse-agonist [[naloxone]], they do not exhibit high-affinity binding for classical opioids, and they are stereoselective for [[Dextrorotation|dextro-rotatory]] [[isomers]] while the other opioid receptors are stereo-selective for [[Laevorotation|laevo-rotatory]] isomers. In addition, there are three subtypes of [[mu opioid receptor|μ]]-receptor: μ<sub>1</sub> and μ<sub>2</sub>, and the newly discovered μ<sub>3</sub>.  Another receptor of clinical importance is the opioid-receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1), which is involved in pain responses as well as having a major role in the development of tolerance to μ-opioid agonists used as analgesics.  These are all [[G-protein coupled receptor]]s acting on [[GABA]]ergic [[neurotransmission]].

[[Image:Morphine Numbered Position.svg|right|thumb|275 px|The numbered substitution positions of the morphine molecule]]

The [[pharmacodynamic]] response to an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an [[agonist]] or an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].  For example, the [[supraspinal (disambiguation)|supraspinal]] analgesic properties of the opioid agonist [[morphine]] are mediated by activation of the μ<sub>1</sub> receptor; respiratory depression and [[Substance dependence|physical dependence]] by the μ<sub>2</sub> receptor; and sedation and spinal analgesia by the κ receptor{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.  Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as μ<sub>1</sub> and μ<sub>2</sub> for example) providing even more [measurably] specific responses.  Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (e.g. the μ, κ, and δ opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid [[morphine]] exhibits high-affinity binding to the μ-opioid receptor, while [[ketazocine]] exhibits high affinity to ĸ receptors.  It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, each with its own unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as N-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.

==History==
Non-clinical use was criminalized in the U.S by the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914, and by other laws worldwide. Since then, nearly all non-clinical use of opioids has been rated zero on the scale of approval of nearly every social institution. However, in United Kingdom the 1926 report of the Departmental Committee on [[Morphine]] and [[Heroin]] [[Substance use disorder|Addiction]] under the Chairmanship of the President of the Royal College of Physicians reasserted medical control and established the "British system" of control—which lasted until the 1960s; in the U.S. the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970 markedly relaxed the harshness of the Harrison Act.

Before the twentieth century, institutional approval was often higher, even in Europe and America. In some cultures, approval of opioids was significantly higher than approval of alcohol. Opiates were used for depression and anxiety up until the mid-1950s.<ref>see Abse; Berridge; Bodkin; Callaway; Emrich; Gold; Gutstein; Mongan; Portenoy; Reynolds; Takano; Verebey; Walsh; Way.<!--Note 37 detailed citations on Talk page.--></ref>

==Society and culture==

===Global shortages===
[[Morphine]] and other poppy-based medicines have been identified by [[the World Health Organization]] as essential in the treatment of severe pain. However, only six countries use 77% of the world's [[morphine]] supplies, leaving many emerging countries lacking in pain relief medication.<ref>http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/008_publication</ref> The current system of supply of raw poppy materials to make poppy-based medicines is regulated by the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] under the provision of the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. The amount of raw poppy materials that each country can demand annually based on these provisions must correspond to an estimate of the country's needs taken from the national consumption within the preceding two years. In many countries, underprescription of morphine is rampant because of the high prices and the lack of training in the prescription of poppy-based drugs. The [[World Health Organization]] is now working with different countries' national administrations to train healthworkers and to develop national regulations regarding drug prescription to facilitate a greater prescription of poppy-based medicines.<ref>The World Health Organization "Assuring Availability of Opioid Analgesics" [www.euro.who.int/document/e76503.pdf]</ref>

Another idea to increase morphine availability is proposed by the [[Senlis Council]], who suggest, through their proposal for [[Afghan Morphine]], that [[Afghanistan]] could provide cheap pain relief solutions to emerging countries as part of a second-tier system of supply that would complement the current [[INCB]] regulated system by maintaining the balance and closed system that it establishes while providing finished product morphine to those suffering from severe pain and unable to access poppy-based drugs under the current system.

===United States approval===
The sole clinical indications for opioids in the United States, according to ''Drug Facts and Comparisons,'' 2005, are:

*Moderate to severe [[pain]], ''i.e.'', to provide analgesia or, in surgery, to induce and maintain [[anesthesia]], as well as allaying patient apprehension right before the procedure. [[Fentanyl]], [[oxymorphone]], [[hydromorphone]], and morphine are most commonly used for this purpose, in conjunction with other drugs such as [[scopolamine]], short and intermediate-acting [[barbiturates]], and [[benzodiazepines]], especially [[midazolam]] which has a rapid onset of action and shorter duration than [[diazepam]] (Valium) or similar drugs.    The enhancement of the effects of each drug by the others is useful in troublesome procedures like [[endoscopies]], complicated and difficult deliveries ([[pethidine]] and its relatives and [[piritramide]] where it is used are favoured by many practitioners with [[morphine]] and derivatives as the second line), incision & drainage of severe abscesses, intraspinal injections, and minor and moderate-impact surgical procedures in patients unable to have general anesthesia due to allergy to some of the drugs involved or other concerns.
*Cough ([[codeine]], [[dihydrocodeine]], [[ethylmorphine]] (dionine), [[hydromorphone]] and [[hydrocodone]], with [[morphine]] or methadone as a last resort.)
*Diarrhea (generally [[loperamide]], [[difenoxin]] or [[diphenoxylate]]; but [[paregoric]], powdered [[opium]] or [[laudanum]] or morphine may be used in some cases of severe diarrheal diseases, e.g. [[cholera]]); also diarrhea secondary to [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]] (Codeine, paregoric, diphenoxylate, difenoxin, loperamide, laudanum)
*Anxiety due to [[dyspnoea|shortness of breath]] ([[oxymorphone]] and [[dihydrocodeine]] only)
*Opioid dependence (methadone and [[buprenorphine]] only)

Opioids are not typically used for psychological relief (with the narrow exception of anxiety due to [[shortness of breath]]).

Opioids are often used in combination with adjuvant analgesics (drugs which have an indirect effect on the pain). In palliative care, opioids are not recommended for sedation or anxiety because experience has found them to be ineffective agents in these roles.  Some opioids are relatively contraindicated in renal failure because of the accumulation of the parent drug or their active metabolites (e.g. codeine and oxycodone). Age (young or old) is not a contraindication to strong opioids.  Some synthetic opioids such as [[pethidine]] have metabolites which are actually neurotoxic and should therefore be used only in acute situations.

==Classification==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
There are a number of broad classes of opioids:

*'''Natural''' [[opiates]]: [[alkaloids]] contained in the resin of the [[opium poppy]], primarily [[morphine]], [[codeine]], and [[thebaine]], but not [[papaverine]] and [[noscapine]] which have a different mechanism of action; The following could be considered natural opiates: The leaves from [[Mitragyna speciosa]] (also known as [[kratom]]) contain a few naturally-occurring opioids, active via Mu- and Delta receptors. [[Salvinorin A]], found naturally in the [[Salvia divinorum]] plant, is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist.
*'''[[Opiate#Esters_of_Morphine|Esters of morphine]]''' opiates: slightly chemically altered but more natural than the semi-synthetics, as most are morphine prodrugs, [[diacetylmorphine]] (morphine diacetate; heroin), [[nicomorphine]] (morphine dinicotinate), [[dipropanoylmorphine]] (morphine dipropionate), [[desomorphine]], [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], [[dibenzoylmorphine]], [[diacetyldihydromorphine]];<ref name=unodc>{{cite web|title=Esters of Morphine|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_2_page009.html|work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|publisher=http://www.unodc.org|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>
*'''Semi-synthetic''' opioids: created from either the natural opiates or morphine esters, such as [[hydromorphone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], [[oxymorphone]], [[ethylmorphine]] and [[buprenorphine]];
*'''Fully synthetic''' opioids: such as [[fentanyl]], [[pethidine]], [[levorphanol]], [[methadone]], [[tramadol]] and [[dextropropoxyphene]];
*'''[[Endogenous]]''' opioid [[peptide]]s, produced naturally in the body, such as [[endorphin]]s, [[enkephalin]]s, [[dynorphin]]s, and [[endomorphin]]s. Morphine, and some other opioids, which are produced in small amounts in the body, are included in this category.
* There are also [[drug]]s such as [[tramadol]] and [[tapentadol]] that are chemically not of the opioid class, but do have [[agonist]] actions at the [[μ-opioid receptor]].  Although their exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, they both have a dual mode of action, the second mode of action appearing to be on the [[noradrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]] systems.<ref>"Ultram brand of TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE" www.opiods.com</ref>  This second mechanism of action was discovered during testing in where the drugs showed signs of [[analgesia]] even when [[naloxone]], an [[opioid antagonist]], was administered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rojas-Corrales MO, Gibert-Rahola J, Micó JA |title=Tramadol induces antidepressant-type effects in mice |journal=Life Sci. |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=PL175–80 |year=1998 |pmid=9749830 |doi= 10.1016/S0024-3205(98)00369-5|url=}}</ref>

Some minor opium [[alkaloids]] and various substances with opioid action are also found elsewhere, including molecules present in [[kratom]], ''[[Corydalis]]'', and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' plants and some species of poppy aside from ''Papaver somniferum''. There are also strains which produce copious amounts of thebaine, an important raw material for making many semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids.  Of all of the more than 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.

Amongst analgesics are a small number of agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid receptor system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction.  Foremost amongst these are [[nefopam]], [[orphenadrine]], and perhaps [[phenyltoloxamine]] and/or some other [[antihistamines]].  [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite ( [[AM404]], making paracetamol a prodrug) which enhances the release of serotonin and also interacts as with the cannabinoid receptors by inhibiting the uptake of [[anandamide]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Other analgesics work peripherally (i.e., not on the brain or spinal cord). Research is starting to show that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons.<ref name="Stein C, Schäfer M, Machelska H (2003)">{{cite journal | author = Stein C, Schäfer M, Machelska H | year = 2003 | title = Attacking pain at its source: new perspectives on opioids | url = | journal = Nature Med | volume = 9 | issue = 8| pages = 1003–1008 | doi = 10.1038/nm908 | pmid = 12894165 }}</ref> A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral opioid receptors, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain.<ref name="Stein C, Lang LJ (2009)">{{cite journal | author = Stein C, Lang LJ | year = 2009 | title = Peripheral mechanisms of opioid analgesia | url = | journal = Curr Opin Pharmacol | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 3–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2008.12.009 | pmid = 19157985 }}</ref> Inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.<ref name="Busch-Dienstfertig M, Stein C (2010)">{{cite journal | author = Busch-Dienstfertig M, Stein C | year = 2010 | title = Opioid receptors and opioid peptide-producing leukocytes in inflammatory pain-basic and therapeutic aspects | url = | journal = Brain Behav Immun | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 683–694 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.10.013 | pmid = 19879349 }}</ref> 

It has been discovered in 1953,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} that the human body, as well as those of some other animals, naturally produce minute amounts of morphine and codeine and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like [[heroin]] and [[dihydromorphine]], in addition to the well known endogenous opioid peptides.  Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as [[hydromorphone]] and [[hydrocodone]] when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.

Many of the [[alkaloids]] and other derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; the best example is the smooth-muscle relaxant [[papaverine]]. Noscapine is a marginal case as it does have CNS effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.<br />
[[Dextromethorphan]] (the stereoisomer of [[levomethorphan]], a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite [[dextrorphan]] have no opioid analgesic effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent [[NMDA|NMDA antagonist]]s and [[sigma receptor|sigma 1 and 2]]-receptor agonists and are used in many [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] cough suppressants.
<br />
[[Salvinorin A]] is a unique selective, powerful ĸ-opioid receptor agonist. It is not properly considered an opioid nevertheless, because
1) chemically, it is not an alkaloid; and
2) it has no typical opioid properties: absolutely no anxiolytic or cough-suppressant effects. It is instead a powerful [[hallucinogen]].

<div class="references-medium" style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;">

===Endogenous opioids===
Opioid-[[peptide]]s that are produced in the body include:

*[[Endorphin]]s
*[[Enkephalin]]s
*[[Dynorphin]]s
*[[Endomorphin]]s

[[β-endorphin]] is expressed in [[Pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC) cells in the [[arcuate nucleus]], in the [[brainstem]] and in immune cells, and acts through [[μ-opioid receptor]]s. β-endorphin has many effects, including on [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] and [[appetite]]. β-endorphin is also secreted into the circulation from pituitary [[corticotropes]] and [[melanotrope]]s. [[α-neo-endorphin]] is also expressed in POMC cells in the arcuate nucleus.

[[met-enkephalin]] is widely distributed in the CNS and in immune cells; [met]-enkephalin is a product of the [[proenkephalin]] gene, and acts through μ and [[δ-opioid receptor]]s. [[leu-enkephalin]], also a product of the proenkephalin gene, acts through δ-opioid receptors.

[[Dynorphin]] acts through [[κ-opioid receptor]]s, and is widely distributed in the CNS, including in the [[spinal cord]] and [[hypothalamus]], including in particular the [[arcuate nucleus]] and in both [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] neurons in the [[supraoptic nucleus]].

[[Endomorphin]] acts through μ-opioid receptors, and is more potent than other endogenous opioids at these receptors.

===Opium alkaloids===
[[Phenanthrene]]s naturally occurring in ([[opium]]):
*[[Codeine]]
*[[Morphine]]
*[[Thebaine]]
*[[Oripavine]]<ref name="Odell 2007">{{cite journal |author=Odell LR, Skopec J, McCluskey A |title=Isolation and identification of unique marker compounds from the Tasmanian poppy Papaver somniferum N.
