'''Robert Palmer Beasley''' (April 29, 1936 – August 25, 2012) was a physician, public health educator and epidemiologist whose work on [[hepatitis B]] involved extensive investigations in [[Taiwan]]. That work established that [[hepatitis B virus]] (HBV) is a primary cause of [[liver cancer]] and that [[hepatitis B virus]] is transmitted from mother to infant during childbirth. Dr. Beasley and his colleagues also proved that HBV mother-to-infant transmission is preventable by at-birth vaccination. Due to this work, the [[World Health Assembly]] designated HBV as the seventh global vaccine in 1992.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Hepatitis B |publisher=Who.int |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184248 |title=JAMA Network &#124; JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association &#124; Development of Hepatitis B Vaccine |publisher=Jama.jamanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> He later became the author of HBV immunization policies for the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite web|author=R.

==Early life and education==

Dr. R. Palmer Beasley was born in [[Glendale, California]] in April 29, 1936 to Robert Seth Beasley and Bernice Palmer Beasley.  Both his grandfather and father were bankers, while his mother was a lecturer.  Both Palmer Beasley and his younger brother, Bruce Miller Beasley, attended public schools.  [[Bruce Beasley]] is now an internationally recognized [[abstract expressionist]] [[sculptor]] who lives and works in [[Oakland, California]].<ref name="autogenerated2"/>   

Palmer Beasley received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in philosophy, with a concentration in causation from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1958.  He studied [[medicine]] at [[Harvard Medical School]] where he was a student of Dr. [[Maxwell Finland]] and graduated in 1962. Upon graduating from medical school, he interned at King County Hospital in [[Seattle]], WA. From 1963 to 1965 he worked in the [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] (EIS) in [[Atlanta]], GA. Dr. Beasley returned to [[Seattle]] in 1965 to start his residency at the [[University of Washington]] Hospital and in 1967 became a senior fellow in [[preventive medicine]] at the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].<ref name="CV">{{cite web|author=R. Palmer Beasley|url=https://sph.uth.tmc.edu/cv/beasley.pdf|title=R. Palmer Beasley, MD, MS Curriculum Vitae|publisher=The University of Texas Health Science Center-Houston, School of Public Health|date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}</ref>

==Academic career==

From 1969 to 1986, Dr. Beasley was an Assistant Professor, then Associate Professor, then full Professor of [[Preventive Medicine]] (adjunct with [[Internal Medicine]]) in the Department of Epidemiology, at the [[University of Washington School of Public Health]] and Community Medicine. In 1979 he became Director of the American University Medical Center (AUMC) in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. From 1986 to 1987, Dr. Beasley served as Professor of Medicine and Head of the Division of AIDS and Chronic Viral Infections at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF). He assumed the position of Dean at the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) School of Public Health (UTSPH) in 1987, and remained dean until 2004. In 2005, he stepped down from the Deanship and had been an Ashbel Smith Professor, Director of the Center for International Training and Research (CITAR) and Dean Emeritus at the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) School of Public Health until his death in August 25, 2012.<ref name="CV"/> Currently, CITAR attracts international students from [[Asia]]--primarily [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[China]]--as well as [[Africa]] to attend courses and seminars and conduct research in [[HIV/AIDS]] and cancers caused by infectious agents.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Draft |url=http://www.researchgrantdatabase.com/g/1D43TW007669-01/CITAR-The-UTSPH-Program-for-Advanced-Training-on-AIDS-Research/ |title=CITAR-The UTSPH Program for Advanced Training on AIDS Research &#124; Database for Research Grants |publisher=Researchgrantdatabase.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

==Research on Hepatitis B==

Dr. Beasley's research on [[hepatitis B]] spans 14 years from 1972 to 1986 in [[Taiwan]]. Before beginning his research on [[hepatitis B]], Dr. Beasley worked on rubella in [[Taiwan]] during the late 1960s and early 1970s with Professor [[Thomas Grayston]] who was the first Dean and founder of the [[University of Washington School of Public Health]] and later became the Vice President of the [[University of Washington]] (UW). While working on a project on the efficacy of the [[Rubella]] vaccine, Dr. Beasley became interested in [[hepatitis]] as "the infectious disease problem least understood and seemingly most important among those that remained unconquered after [[polio]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]] had been brought under control.".<ref name="washington1">{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1969c.html |title=Epidemiology of Hepatitis B: From Carrier to Cancer |publisher=Washington.edu |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

In 1964, Dr. [[Baruch Samuel Blumberg]] discovered a surface [[antigen]] for [[hepatitis B]] in the blood of an [[Australian]] aborigine and, together with his team, developed a screening test. In 1974 Dr. [[Baruch Samuel Blumberg]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for this discovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1976/blumberg-autobio.html |title=Baruch S. Blumberg - Autobiography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> The [[Abbott Laboratories]] then developed a more sensitive and specific [[radioimmunoassay]] technique to detect the surface [[antigen]] of [[hepatitis B]].

Dr. Beasley was excited that this technique would bring a new tool for his epidemiological study on [[hepatitis B]].<ref name="washington1"/> At that time, [[hepatitis B]] was known to be transmitted only from blood (i.e., transfusions, injections, blood products or inadvertent needle sticks). However, an important question occurred to him: “How was the virus transferred prior to the advent of modern technology?” <ref name="washington1"/>

"Since transfusions are relatively recent in human history, how was this agent transmitted in nature before that?" he asked. Beasley says he "got a lot of puzzled looks" but no answers. "I suggested we ought to look to see if it isn't transmitted from mothers to babies, since that's the commonest way in nature that blood is shared between people. With that hypothesis I went to [[Taiwan]] and, with the [[Abbott Laboratories]] test, began screening and detecting carrier pregnant women in the obstetric clinics at the hospitals in [[Taipei]]. After some months of doing this, we had determined that almost 20% of the mothers in [[Taiwan]] were [[hepatitis B]] carriers, which is a phenomenally high rate." That figure contrasts sharply to a rate of less than 1% in the [[U.S.]] "About 40% of the babies of those carrier-mothers became infected," said Beasley.<ref name="washington1"/><ref>Beasley RP: Transmission of hepatitis by breast feeding. N Eng J Med 1975;292:1354</ref>

Dr. Beasley then showed that the “E” [[antigen]] is a good predictor for [[vertical transmission]] from mother-to-infant.<ref>Beasley RP, Trepo C, Stevens CE, Szmuness W. The e antigen and vertical transmission of hepatitis B surface antigen. Am J Epidemiol 1977;105(2):94-98</ref> This observation led to new clinical trials on the hypothesis of whether the [[hepatitis B immune globulin]] (HBIG) protects newborns from being vertically transmitted from their mothers. Dr. Beasley and his team reported that babies receiving HBIG within a few hours of birth were protected whereas there was no protection for those who received HBIG after 24 hours. HBIG was then refined for administration to all newborns within minutes after birth. The results were astounding as the incidence of infection was reduced by approximately 75%.<ref>Beasley RP, Hwang LY, Lin CC, Stevens CE, Wang KY, Sun TS, Hsieh FJ, Szmuness W. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) efficacy in the interruption of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus carrier state. Initial report of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 1981;2(8243):388-393</ref>

At the same time, Dr. Beasley tried to test his hypothesis that [[hepatitis B]] causes [[liver cancer]]. However, he “ran into enormous skepticism by almost everybody” and “people were saying I was crazy.”<ref name="washington1"/> The notion at that time was that the cause of liver cancer was already known to be [[aflatoxins]]. With the start of the [[War on Cancer]], beginning in 1975, the major focus in cancer research was on environmental factors.<ref name="washington1"/>

Nonetheless, Dr. Beasley pursued his controversial hypothesis by designing one of the first large cohort studies to test the link between [[hepatitis B]] and [[liver cancer]]. With his co-investigator, Dr. Lu-Yu Hwang, and the [[Taiwan]] team of investigators, he conducted a study of over 22,000 government workers starting in 1974 and followed them up to the present. That long-term study found that the risk of [[liver cancer]] was 60 times higher in chronic HBV infected persons than non-HBV carriers, and that the life-time risk of dying from [[liver cancer]] was 40% in infected men and 15% in infected women.<ref>Beasley RP, Hwang LY, Lin CC, Chien CS. Hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis B virus. A prospective study of 22,707 men in Taiwan. Lancet 1981;2(8256):1129-1133</ref> Noted that the association between [[liver cancer]] and HBV carriers was stronger than the association between [[lung cancer]] and smoking (i.e., 20-25 times). “It’s one of the highest [[relative risk]]s that anyone has ever seen,” said Beasley. However, skepticism remained “because many people feel that establishing causation requires elucidating a plausible mechanism by which the effect occurs,” he recalled.<ref name="washington1"/>

In 1984, a vaccine program was launched in [[Taiwan]] and, in 1997, [[Taiwan]] reported a significant drop in [[liver cancer]] rates in children under 15 years of age after the adoption of a national universal newborn vaccination program.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Following the recommendation of the [[World Health Organization]] in 1992, [[HBV vaccine]] has been used globally and was, at the time, the only immunization available to prevent a major human cancer.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> By the end of July 2011, 179 countries worldwide used [[hepatitis B vaccine]] as part of their national vaccination programs.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Dr. Beasley's work, and subsequent investigations by other researchers, has proved that there is a causal relationship between [[hepatitis]] and [[liver cancer]]. In 2005, HBV was officially recognized as one of 58 known agents that cause human cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/toc11.htm |title=11th Report on Carcinogens |publisher=Ntp.niehs.nih.gov |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

"Dr. Beasley has saved countless lives from [[cirrhosis]] and [[liver cancer]] through his work on the [[epidemiology]] and prevention of [[hepatitis B]]," according to Dr. Herbert L. DuPont, Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] School of Public Health. "He is a giant in the field of infectious diseases.".<ref name="autogenerated2"/>   

Dr. [[Samuel Katz (pediatrician)]], Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Pediatrics at the Duke Children’s Hospital and Health Center, [[Duke University Health System]], has said, “Palmer’s abundant achievements are highlighted most by his 14 years in [[Taiwan]], where he was responsible for a succession of investigations—clinical, epidemiological and laboratory—which led to a full understanding of the spectrum of [[hepatitis B virus]] infection. These studies elucidated its [[virology]], [[immunology]], transmission and clinical manifestations, including its causal link to chronic [[hepatitis]], [[cirrhosis]] and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].” Dr. Beasley “demonstrated the efficacy of [[hepatitis B immune globulin]] in blocking infection, especially maternal-infant, and [[hepatitis B vaccine]] in its prevention. His longitudinal observations were the first to demonstrate that [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] was prevented in Taiwanese males by early life vaccination. Subsequent studies involved the then newly identified [[hepatitis C virus]],” Dr. Katz writes.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>   

According to Dr. Cladd E. Stevens, his former student at the [[University of Washington]] who worked with Dr. Beasley in Taiwanese studies, “Dr. Beasley’s work {{sic|has lead to}} the thorough understanding and effective prevention of HBV infection and its long-term consequences on a global scale, making [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] and [[cirrhosis]] of the liver--one of the primary causes of death for much of the developing world of [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]--a thing of the past for current and future generations.” <ref name="autogenerated2"/> 

At the ceremony where Dr. Beasley was given the 2010 Hepatitis B Foundation's Distinguished Scientist Award, Dr. [[Baruch Samuel Blumberg]] said "There are at least a million people alive today who would not be if it were not for Dr. Beasley's research.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hepb.webhealthyrecipes.com/Good-Health/Hep-B-Informed/Foundation-News/Dr.-R.-Palmer-Beasley-Honored-as-Distinguished-Scientist-2010.html |title=Dr. R. Palmer Beasley Honored as Distinguished Scientist 2010 |publisher=Hepb.webhealthyrecipes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> On that occasion, Roberta T. Ness, Dean of the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) School of Public Health (UTSPH), said in The Medical News, “Dr. Beasley’s contributions to understanding the link between [[hepatitis B]] and [[liver cancer]] have saved thousands of lives. His work not only transformed our understanding of the cause of [[liver cancer]], but then spearheaded the solution through vaccination.”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100109/R-Palmer-Beasley-awarded-Hepatitis-B-Foundations-Distinguished-Scientist-Award-2010.aspx |title=R.

==Public health education==

Dr. Beasley represented UTSPH to the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) for almost 20 years. During those years he visited most of the now 38 schools of public health in the US, represented ASPH as a counselor/board member on the [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH), chaired several of the key committees of ASPH including the Education Committee, and the International Health Committee. He also served on the ASPH's Executive Committee as Treasurer, Vice President, and later President. As President he led efforts to strengthen the accreditation criteria and procedures used by CEPH, increase practical as part of MPH level education, establish [[credentialing]] for [[public health]] professionals, increase funding for the [[National Institutes of Health]] ([[NIH]]) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), reform the CDC to included better funding for extramural investigators, and build closer ties with foreign schools of public health. He has visited many schools of [[public health]] in many countries and as President of the ASPH he initiated an effort to have the schools cooperate to encourage [[public health]] education in [[India]] through the establishment of national schools of [[public health]]. He has also served as internal advisor to several established foreign schools of [[public health]] (e.g. [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], [[National Taiwan University]] School of [[Public Health]]), and schools in evolution (e.g. [[Kyoto University]]). In his roles on CEPH and ASPH he has reviewed the accreditation documents of every school of public health in the [[United States]]. 

In 2005 the ASPH gave greater emphasis to international health when it created a new cross-divisional Global Health Program with funding from an FIC Framework grant jointly to UT and [[Baylor College of Medicine]]. This highly successful program has stimulated increasing numbers of students and faculty to learn about global health issues and seek experiences in developing countries.  

After stepping down from the Deanship in 2005, Dr. Beasley has devoted most of his time and effort to global health research and training. In 2004, he created CITAR, under the sponsorship of the [[John E. Fogarty International Center]], [[NIH]] to provide a training focus for foreign students seeking graduate level proficiency related to [[HIV]] research with its initial focus on [[Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Fogarty International Center |url=http://www.fic.nih.gov/Grants/Search/Pages/AITRP-1D43TW007669-01.aspx |title=Fogarty Grant: CITAR – The UTSPH Program for Advanced Training on AIDS Research - Fogarty International Center @ NIH |publisher=Fic.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> In 2007, he began a program of summer research internships for American students in international settings.

==Personal life==

Dr. Beasley was married to Dr. Lu-Yu Hwang, who is also a world-renown expert in [[HIV]] and HBV and is currently a Professor of Epidemiology at the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) School of Public Health (UTSPH). He has two children from a previous marriage, and one child with Dr. Hwang.

==Books==

Dr. Beasley was the Chair of the Committee on the Prevention and Control of [[Viral Hepatitis]] Infections Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice at the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] for the book titled “[[Hepatitis]] and [[Liver Cancer]]: A National Strategy for Prevention and Control of [[Hepatitis B]] and C”, edited by Heather M.

In his obituary at the New York Times, August 27, 2012, Dr. DuPont, the director of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the University of Texas, commented on Dr. Beasley's pioneer work in Taiwan “It’s almost like an Albert Schweitzer trying to figure out Africa. It’s a very unusual thing in medicine to see a senior person like Palmer Beasley living and fighting those wars himself.”<ref name="New York Times"/>

The Houston Chronicle on August 27, 2012 runs the title "Dr. Palmer Beasley was instrumental in linking liver cancer, hepatitis B". The article also quoted part of his interview with Houston Chronicle in which he said: ""I decided what we now call hepatitis B looked like the most poorly understood and least-controlled infectious disease problem in the world, and, therefore, the most important frontier," and his difficulty in convincing the Chinese that the disease was worth funding. <ref name="Houston Chronicle"/>
