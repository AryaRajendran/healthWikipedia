'''Non-epileptic seizures''' are [[Paroxysmal attacks|paroxysmal]] events that mimic an [[epileptic seizure]] but do not involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of cortical [[neuron]]s.<ref name="Ricker2003">{{cite book

==Diagnosis==

A wide spectrum of phenomena may resemble epileptic seizures, which may lead to people who do not have [[epilepsy]] being misdiagnosed. Indeed, a significant percentage of people initially diagnosed with epilepsy will later have this revised. In one study, the majority of children referred to a secondary clinic with "fits, faints and funny turns" did not have epilepsy, with [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting) as the most common alternative.<ref name="Hindley2006">{{cite journal

==Terminology==
The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) define an '''epileptic seizure''' as "a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain."<ref name="Fisher2005">{{cite journal

Medically, when used on its own, the term '''seizure''' implies an '''epileptic seizure'''. The lay use of this word can also include sudden attacks of illness, loss of control, spasm or stroke.<ref name="Fisher2005"/> Where the physician is uncertain as to the diagnosis, the medical term '''paroxysmal event''' and the lay terms '''spells''', '''funny turns''' or '''attacks''' may be used.

==Causes==
Possible pathophysiological causes include:

*[[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]]

*[[Hypoglycemia]] and associated [[neuroglycopenia]]
*[[Migraine]]
*[[Narcolepsy]]
*Non-epileptic [[myoclonus]]
*[[Opsoclonus]]
*[[Parasomnia]]s, including [[night terrors]]
*Paroxysmal kinesiogenic [[dyskinesia]]
*[[Reflex anoxic seizures]]
*[[Primary central nervous system lymphoma]]
*Repetitive or ritualistic behaviours
