'''Inverse ratio ventilation''' ('''IRV''') is not necessarily a [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] though it may be referred to as such.  IRV is a strategy (method or style) of ventilating the lungs in such a way that some inspired air is not allowed to be exhaled, creating intrinsic positive-end expiratory pressure (autoPEEP) and allowing for a constant inflation of the lungs, ensuring they remain "recruited" (meaning they participate in gas exchange and are not allowed to deflate to get stuck together or tighten up).  The primary goal for IRV is improved oxygenation by forcing inspiratory time to be greater than expiratory time (example: inhale is 3 seconds and exhalation is 1 second) increasing the mean airway pressure and potentially improving oxygenation. Normal I:E ratio is 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, so forcing the I:E to be 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, (or even as high as 20:1) is the source of the term for the strategy.

IRV has never been shown to improve important clinical outcomes, such as mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or duration of ICU stay. This may be due to the fact that IRV is not considered as a mode early enough once ARDS is diagnosed. The preponderance of evidence suggests that IRV improves oxygenation, although the evidence is weak and characterized by low quality, conflicting studies.<ref name="pmid8365303">{{cite journal| author=Mercat A, Graïni L, Teboul JL, Lenique F, Richard C| title=Cardiorespiratory effects of pressure-controlled ventilation with and without inverse ratio in the adult respiratory distress syndrome. | journal=Chest | year= 1993 | volume= 104 | issue= 3 | pages= 871–5 | pmid=8365303 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid11176158">{{cite journal| author=Mercat A, Diehl JL, Michard F, Anguel N, Teboul JL, Labrousse J et al.| title=Extending inspiratory time in acute respiratory distress syndrome. | journal=Crit Care Med | year= 2001 | volume= 29 | issue= 1 | pages= 40–4 | pmid=11176158 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid8173778">{{cite journal| author=Shanholtz C, Brower R| title=Should inverse ratio ventilation be used in adult respiratory distress syndrome? | journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med | year= 1994 | volume= 149 | issue= 5 | pages= 1354–8 | pmid=8173778 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid9154869">{{cite journal| author=Mercat A, Titiriga M, Anguel N, Richard C, Teboul JL| title=Inverse ratio ventilation (I/E = 2/1) in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a six-hour controlled study. | journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med | year= 1997 | volume= 155 | issue= 5 | pages= 1637–42 | pmid=9154869 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid11918879">{{cite journal| author=Wang SH, Wei TS| title=The outcome of early pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation on patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in surgical intensive care unit. | journal=Am J Surg | year= 2002 | volume= 183 | issue= 2 | pages= 151–5 | pmid=11918879 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=11918879  }}</ref><ref name="pmid8004312">{{cite journal| author=Sydow M, Burchardi H, Ephraim E, Zielmann S, Crozier TA| title=Long-term effects of two different ventilatory modes on oxygenation in acute lung injury.

==Types==
IRV can be performed during [[pressure-controlled ventilation]] (PC-IRV) or [[volume-controlled ventilation]] (VC-IRV). Neither is clearly superior to the other. In a multicenter, randomized trial that compared PC-IRV to VC-IRV in patients with [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], the type of IRV did not affect mortality.<ref name="pmid10858404">{{cite journal| author=Esteban A, Alía I, Gordo F, de Pablo R, Suarez J, González G et al.| title=Prospective randomized trial comparing pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation in ARDS.

==Associated risk==
The shorter expiratory time during IRV increases the risk of auto-PEEP and its associated development of problems (e.g. [[pulmonary barotrauma]], [[hypotension]]).<ref name="pmid3168572"/> IRV also appears to increase the risk of pulmonary barotrauma independent of auto-PEEP. In a study of 14 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation with PC-IRV, the incidence of pneumothorax was 29 percent despite the lack of measurable auto-PEEP.<ref name="pmid7867353">{{cite journal| author=Armstrong BW, MacIntyre NR| title=Pressure-controlled, inverse ratio ventilation that avoids air trapping in the adult respiratory distress syndrome. | journal=Crit Care Med | year= 1995 | volume= 23 | issue= 2 | pages= 279–85 | pmid=7867353 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>

==Modes that utilize IRV==
The most popular mode that utilizes IRV is the [[airway pressure release ventilation]] mode, also known by the brand name "BiVent".  This employs an extremely high inverse ratio in a continuous pressure system similar to [[biphasic positive airway pressure]] but with several additional variables.
