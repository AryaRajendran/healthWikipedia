A '''toxin''' (from {{lang-grc|τοξικόν|toxikon}}) is a [[poison]]ous substance produced within living cells or organisms;<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000109718|toxin}}</ref><ref name="urltoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toxin |title=toxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |work= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref> man-made substances created by artificial processes are thus excluded. The term was first used by organic chemist [[Ludwig Brieger]] (1849–1919).<ref>http://books.google.co.za/books?id=oWhqhK1cE-gC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=Ludwig+Brieger+[1849-1919]&source=bl&ots=7fa0fkkgkV&sig=ItABIJkoSsxyTdM9ts3iSSD3NQc&hl=en&ei=2lwmTKuaH4i6jAffyMGUAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Ludwig%20Brieger%20[1849-1919]&f=false</ref>

For a toxic substance not produced within living organisms, "[[toxicant]]" and "toxics" are also sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

Toxins can be [[small molecule]]s, [[peptide]]s, or [[protein]]s that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by [[Biological tissue|body tissue]]s interacting with biological [[macromolecule]]s such as [[enzyme]]s or [[Receptor (biochemistry)|cellular receptors]]. Toxins vary greatly in their severity, ranging from usually minor and acute (as in a [[bee]] [[Stinger|sting]]) to almost immediately deadly (as in [[botulinum toxin]]).

==Terminology==
Toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of production - the word toxin does not specify method of delivery (compare with [[venom]] and the narrower meaning of [[poison]] – all substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms). It simply means it is a biologically produced poison.
There was an ongoing terminological dispute between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] over whether to call a toxin a [[Biological agent|biological]] or [[chemical agent]], in which the NATO opted for biological agent, and the Warsaw Pact, like most other countries in the world, for chemical agent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

According to an [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] review of the [[Biological Weapons Convention]], "Toxins are poisonous products of organisms; unlike biological agents, they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves." and "Since the signing of the Convention, there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins..."<ref name="urlThe Biological Weapons Convention - An overview">{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNPA |title=The Biological Weapons Convention - An overview |work= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref> 

According to [[Title 18 of the United States Code]], "...the term "toxin" means the [[toxic]] material or product of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[microorganism]]s (including, but not limited to, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], [[rickettsiae]] or [[protozoa]]), or infectious substances, or a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] or synthesized molecule, whatever their origin and method of production..."<ref name="urlU.S. Code">{{cite web |url=http://law2.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+235+1++()%20%20AND%20((18)%20ADJ%20USC)%3ACITE%20AND%20(USC%20w/10%20(209))%3ACITE |title=U.S. Code |work= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref>

A rather informal terminology of individual toxins relate them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable:
* [[Hemotoxin]], causes destruction of [[red blood cells]] ([[hemolysis]])
* [[Phototoxin]], causes dangerous photosensitivity

On a broader scale, toxins may be classified as either [[exotoxin]]s, being excreted by an organism, and [[endotoxin]]s, that are released mainly when bacteria are lysed...

Related terms are:
* [[Toxoid]], weakened or suppressed toxin
* [[Venom]], toxins in the sense of use by certain types of animals

== Biotoxins ==
The term "biotoxin" is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin.<ref name="urlbiotoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biotoxin |title=biotoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |work= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000012874|biotoxin}}</ref> 

Toxins produced by [[microorganism]]s are important [[virulence]] determinants responsible for microbial [[pathogenicity]] and/or evasion of the host [[immune response]].<ref name= ProftT>{{cite book |author= Proft T (editor)| year=2009 |title=Microbial Toxins: Current Research and Future Trends | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-44-8}}</ref>

Biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism, and can be highly complex (the [[venom]] of the [[cone snail]] contains dozens of small [[protein]]s, each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor), or relatively small protein.

Biotoxins in nature have two primary functions:

*[[Predation]] ([[spider]], [[snake]], [[scorpion]], [[jellyfish]], [[wasp]])
*Defense ([[bee]], [[ant]], [[termite]], [[Honey bee|honeybee]], [[wasp]], [[poison dart frog]])

Some of the more well known types of biotoxins include:
*[[Cyanotoxin]]s, produced by [[cyanobacteria]]
*[[Hemotoxin]]s target and destroy red blood cells, and are transmitted through the bloodstream. Organisms that produce hemotoxins include:
**[[Pit viper]]s, such as [[rattlesnake]]s
*[[Necrosis|Necrotoxins]] cause necrosis (i.e., death) in the cells they encounter and destroy all types of [[biological tissue|tissue]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Necrotoxins spread through the bloodstream{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. In humans, [[skin]] and [[muscle]] tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxins{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Organisms that possess necrotoxins include:
**The [[Brown recluse spider|brown recluse]] or "fiddle back" spider
**The "Puff Adder" - ''[[Bitis arietans]]''
**[[Necrotizing fasciitis]] (the "flesh eating" [[Streptococcus pyogenes|bacteria]])
*[[Neurotoxin]]s primarily affect the nervous systems of animals. Organisms that possess neurotoxins include:
**The [[Black widow spider|Black Widow]] and other [[widow spider]]s
**Most [[scorpion]]s
**The [[box jellyfish]]
**[[Elapidae|Elapid]] snakes
**The [[Cone snail|Cone Snail]]
*[[Cytotoxic|Cytotoxins]] are toxic at the level of individual cells, either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells:
**[[Ricin]] is a plant toxin found in the castor bean plant
*[[Apitoxin]], the [[honey bee]] venom
*[[Mycotoxin]]s are toxins produced by fungi.  They are a common source of toxins in grains and other foods.
*Eosinophil derived neurotoxin is a toxin found in human encoded by the RNASE2 gene. it is found only in eosinophils

==Environmental toxins==
The term "environmental toxin" is often used.<ref name="pmid15783252">{{cite journal |author=Lanphear BP, Vorhees CV, Bellinger DC |title=Protecting Children from Environmental Toxins |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e61 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15783252 |pmc=1069659 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020061 |url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020061}}</ref><ref name="pmid17942951">{{cite journal |author=Grollman AP, Jelaković B |title=Role of environmental toxins in endemic (Balkan) nephropathy.

In these contexts, it can sometimes explicitly include contaminants that are man-made,<ref name="pmid14977703">{{cite journal |author=Grigg J |title=Environmental toxins; their impact on children's health |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=244–50 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14977703 |pmc=1719840 |doi= 10.1136/adc.2002.022202|url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14977703}}</ref> which contradicts most formal definitions of the term "toxin". Because of this, when encountering the word "toxin" outside of microbiological contexts, it is important to confirm what the researcher means by the use of the term.

=== Finding information about toxins===
The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP)<ref>[http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html SIS.nlm.nih.gov]</ref> at the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by TEHIP and by other government agencies and organizations. This web site includes links to databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources. TEHIP also is responsible for the Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET),<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/ Toxnet.nlm.nih.gov]</ref> an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web.

[[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that is part of TOXNET. TOXMAP uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s.

==Misuse==
When used non-technically, the term "toxin" is often applied to any [[toxic]] substance. Toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed [[poison]]s and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to [[Toxicity (disambiguation)|toxic]] substances in general.

In the context of [[alternative medicine]] the term is often used to refer to any substance claimed to (allegedly) cause ill health, ranging anywhere from trace amounts of [[pesticide]]s to common food items like refined [[sugar]] or [[Food additive|additives]] such as [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).<ref>[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/14/ Prince of Wales criticised for dodgy detox product], Sense About Science, March 2009</ref>
