'''Choking''' is the mechanical obstruction of the flow of air from the environment into the lungs. Choking prevents [[breathing]], and can be partial or complete, with partial choking allowing some, although inadequate, flow of air into the lungs. Prolonged or complete choking results in [[asphyxia]] which leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and is potentially fatal. Oxygen stored in the blood and lungs keep the victim alive for several minutes after breathing is stopped completely.<ref>{{Cite book|url= http://books.google.com/?id=BFl6GGZsqp4C&pg=PA49&dq=Asphyxiation+and+Ventilatory+Requirements#v=onepage&q=Asphyxiation%20and%20Ventilatory%20Requirements&f=false |title= Sudden Deaths in Custody|isbn= 978-1-59745-015-7|author1= Ross, Darrell Lee|author2= Chan, Theodore C|year= 2006}}</ref>

Choking can be caused by:
* Physical obstruction of the airway by a [[foreign body]].
* [[Respiratory disease]]s that involve obstruction of the airway.
* Compression of the [[laryngopharynx]], [[larynx]] or [[vertebrate trachea]] in [[strangulation]].

==Symptoms and signs==
* The person cannot speak or cry out, or has great difficulty and limited ability to do so.
* Breathing, if possible, is labored, producing gasping or [[wheeze|wheezing]].
* The person has a violent and largely involuntary cough, gurgle, or vomiting noise, though more serious choking victims will have a limited (if any) ability to produce these symptoms since they require at least some air movement.
* The person desperately clutches his or her throat or mouth, or attempts to induce vomiting by putting their fingers down their throat.
* If breathing is not restored, the person's face turns blue ([[cyanosis]]) from lack of oxygen.
* The person does any or all of the above, and if breathing is not restored, then becomes unconscious.


==Cause==
The type of choking most commonly recognized as such by the public is the lodging of [[foreign body|foreign objects]] (also known as foreign bodies, but consisting of any object which comes from outside the body itself, including food, toys or household objects) in the airway.<ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine">{{Cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview |title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref>

This type of choking is often suffered by small children, who are unable to appreciate the [[hazard]] inherent in putting small objects in their mouth.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics (healthychildren.org)|url=http://www.healthychildren.org/english/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/pages/choking-prevention.aspx?nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token|title=Choking Prevention|date=2010-06-14}}</ref>  In adults, it mostly occurs whilst the [[patient]] is eating.  In one study, [[peanut]]s were the most common obstruction.<ref name="pmid17728968">{{Cite journal|author=Yadav SP, Singh J, Aggarwal N, Goel A|title=Airway foreign bodies in children: experience of 132 cases |journal=Singapore Med J|volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=850–3 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17728968 |doi=|url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/4809/4809a10.pdf}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Heimlich.JPG|thumb|A device used to self administer the Heimlich]]
Choking can be treated with a number of different procedures, with both basic techniques available for [[first aid]]ers and more advanced techniques available for health professionals. In the United States, members of the public commonly assume that [[#Abdominal thrusts|abdominal thrusts]], also known as the Heimlich Maneuver, are the correct procedure for choking, due to widespread promotion of this technique in the past, including recommendations from  the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross. People elsewhere also often assume this, due in part to widespread use of this technique in [[movie]]s.{{cn|date=May 2012}}

Most modern protocols, including those of the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross, recommend several stages, designed to apply increasingly more pressure. The Red Cross changed their recommendation in 2006, ending their promotion of abdominal thrusts as the primary treatment for choking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0%2C1077%2C0_314_5262%2C00.html |title=The American Red Cross Unveils Innovative New First Aid and CPR/AED Training Programs |date=April 04, 2006 |publisher=American National Red Cross |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060429202036/http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_5262,00.html |archivedate=April 29, 2006}}</ref>

The key stages in most modern protocols include:

===Encouraging the victim to cough===
This stage was introduced in many protocols as it was found that many people were too quick to undertake potentially dangerous interventions, such as abdominal thrusts, for items which could have been dislodged without intervention.  Also, if the choking is caused by an irritating substance rather than an obstructing one, and if conscious, the patient should be allowed to drink water on their own to try to clear the throat.  Since the airway is already closed, there is very little danger of water entering the lungs. Coughing is normal after most of the irritant has cleared, and at this point the patient will probably refuse any additional water for a short time.

===Back slaps===
The majority of protocols now advocate the use of hard blows with the heel of the hand on the upper back of the victim. The number to be used varies by training organization, but is usually between five and twenty.

The back slap is designed to use percussion to create pressure behind the blockage, assisting the patient in dislodging the article.  In some cases the physical [[vibration]] of the action may also be enough to cause movement of the article sufficient to allow clearance of the airway.

Almost all protocols give back slaps as a technique to be used before potentially damaging interventions such as abdominal thrusts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guildner CW, Williams D, Subitch T |title=Airway obstructed by foreign material: the Heimlich maneuver |journal=JACEP |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=675–7 |year=1976 |month=September |pmid=1018395 |doi=10.1016/S0361-1124(76)80099-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0300-9572(00)00161-1 |author=Langhelle A, Sunde K, Wik L, Steen PA |title=Airway pressure with chest compressions versus Heimlich manoeuvre in recently dead adults with complete airway obstruction |journal=Resuscitation |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=105–8 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10767497 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0300-9572(00)00161-1}}</ref> [[Henry Heimlich]], noted for promulgating abdominal thrusts, claimed that back slaps were proven to cause death by lodging foreign objects into the windpipe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/opinion/l06heimlich.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=heimlich&st=cse|publisher=New York Times|title=Heimlich, on the maneuver|accessdate=2009-02-07 | date=2009-02-06}}</ref> The 1982 Yale study by Day, DuBois, and Crelin that "persuaded the American Heart Association to stop recommending back blows for dealing with choking...was partially funded by Heimlich's own foundation."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pittmed.health.pitt.edu/AUG_2005/life_jackets.pdf?_r=1&scp=1&sq=heimlich&st=cse|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Medical School|title=Lifejackets on Ice (August 2005)|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref> According to Roger White MD of the Mayo Clinic and American Heart Association (AHA), "There was never any science here.

===Abdominal thrusts===<!-- This section is linked from [[Heimlich maneuver]] and [[Abdominal thrusts]] -->
Abdominal thrusts, also known by the proprietary name the Heimlich maneuver (after [[Henry Heimlich]], who first described the procedure in a June 1974 informal article entitled "Pop Goes the Cafe Coronary", published in the journal ''Emergency Medicine''). Edward A. Patrick, MD, PhD, an associate of Heimlich, has claimed to be the uncredited co-developer of the procedure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patrickinstitute.org/press_release.htm|title=Patrick Institute|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> Heimlich has objected to the name "abdominal thrusts" on the grounds that the vagueness of the term "abdomen" could cause the rescuer to exert force at the wrong site.<ref>{{Cite book| url= http://books.google.com/?id=Xcnwm8zE24QC&pg=PA206&dq=Heimlich+lethal#v=onepage&q=Heimlich%20lethal&f=false | title= Drowning: new perspectives on intervention and prevention |date= 1998 |author= John R.

Performing abdominal thrusts involves a rescuer standing behind a patient and using his or her hands to exert pressure on the bottom of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]], hopefully expelling it.  This amounts to an artificial [[cough]].

Due to the forceful nature of the procedure, even when done correctly, it can injure the person on whom it is performed. Bruising to the [[abdomen]] is highly likely and more serious injuries can occur, including fracture of the [[xiphoid process]] or [[rib]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.discovery.com/encyclopedias/illnesses.html?article=671 |title=Heimlich maneuver on self |publisher=Discovery Channel |last=Broomfield |first=James |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

In some areas, such as Australia, authorities believe that there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of abdominal thrusts and their use is not recommended in first aid.<ref name='The Health Report'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/healthreport/stories/2009/2634253.htm |title=The Heimlich manoeuvre |accessdate=2009-07-27 |last=Swan |first=Norman |date=27 July 2009 |work=The Health Report |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|quote=...the reason it's not taught is the simple fact that research conducted here in Australia and also overseas has proven that it can be dangerous...}}</ref>

====Self treatment with abdominal thrusts====
A person may also perform abdominal thrusts on themselves by using a fixed object such as a railing or the back of a chair to apply pressure  where a rescuer's hands would normally do so.  As with other forms of the procedure, it is possible that internal injuries may result.

===Modified chest thrusts===
A modified version of the technique is sometimes taught for use with [[pregnant]] and/or [[obesity|obese]] patients. The rescuer places their hand in the center of the chest to compress, rather than in the abdomen.

===Finger sweeping===
The [[American Medical Association]] advocates sweeping the fingers across the back of the throat to attempt to dislodge airway obstructions, once the choking victim becomes unconscious.<ref name=AMA>{{Cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=WuvXnhwU8nQC&pg=PR8&dq=AMA+Emergency#v=onepage&q=dislodge%20the%20object&f=false | title= American Medical Association Handbook of First Aid and Emergency Care | author= [[American Medical Association]] | publisher= [[Random House]]| isbn=978-1-4000-0712-7| date=2009-05-05}}</ref>

Some protocols advocate the use of the rescuer's finger to 'sweep' foreign objects away once they have reached the mouth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  However, many modern protocols recommend against the use of the finger sweep since, if the patient is conscious, they will be able to remove the foreign object themselves, or if they are unconscious, the rescuer should simply place them in the [[recovery position]] (where the object should fall out due to gravity).  There is also a risk of causing further damage (for instance inducing vomiting) by using a finger sweep technique.

===Direct vision removal===
The advanced medical procedure to remove such objects is inspection of the airway with a [[laryngoscope]] or [[bronchoscope]], and removal of the object under direct vision, followed by [[CPR]] if the patient does not start breathing on their own. Severe cases where there is an inability to remove the object may require [[cricothyrotomy]].

===CPR===
In most protocols, once the patient has become unconscious, the emphasis switches to performing [[CPR]], involving both chest compressions and [[artificial respiration]].  These actions are often enough to dislodge the item sufficiently for air to pass it, allowing gaseous exchange in the lungs.

==Notable cases==
*The former [[President of the United States]], [[George W. Bush]], survived choking on a [[pretzel]] on January 13, 2002, an event that received major media coverage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1758848.stm |title=Bush makes light of pretzel scare |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-01-14 |accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>
*[[Jimmie Foxx]], a famous [[Major League Baseball]] player, died by choking on a bone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.armchairgm.com/index.php?title=Jimmie_Foxx|title=Jimmie Foxx Obituary|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

*An urban legend states that obese singer [[Mama Cass]] choked to death on a ham sandwich. This was borne out of a quickly discarded speculation by the [[coroner]], who noted a partly eaten ham sandwich and figured she may have choked to death.  In fact, she died of a heart condition, often wrongly referred to in the media as [[heart failure]].<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=Snopes Urban Legend Reference |url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/mamacass.asp |title=Urban Legend of Mama Cass choking |accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>
*[[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] was admitted to hospital for an operation in May 1993 after choking on a fish bone.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/262249.stm |title=Queen Mother recovers after operation |accessdate=2009-08-22 | date=1999-01-25}}</ref>

==Other uses of abdominal thrusts==
Dr. Heimlich has advocated the use of the technique as a treatment for [[drowning]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heimlichinstitute.org/drowning.php |title=Heimlich Institute on rescuing drowning victims |accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> and [[asthma]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heimlichinstitute.org/asthma.php |title=Heimlich Institute on rescuing asthma victims |accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> attacks. The Red Cross contests his claims that the maneuver could help drowning victims and someone suffering an asthma attack. The Heimlich Institute has stopped advocating on their website for the Heimlich maneuver to be used as a first aid measure for drowning victims. His son, Peter M. Heimlich, alleges that in August 1974 his father published the first of a series of fraudulent case reports in order to promote the use of abdominal thrusts for near-drowning rescue.<ref name="pheimlich">{{Cite web|url=http://www.medfraud.info|title='Outmaneuvered - How We Busted the Heimlich Medical Frauds' |first=Peter M |last=Heimlich |accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>
