'''Nutritional diseases''' are [[disease]]s in humans that are directly or indirectly caused by a lack of [[essential nutrient]]s in the diet. Nutritional diseases are commonly associated with chronic [[malnutrition]]. Additionally, conditions such as [[obesity]] from overeating can also cause, or contribute to, serious health problems. Excessive intake of some nutrients can also cause acute poisoning.

==Overnutrition==
{{Main|Overnutrition}}

=== Metabolic ===

[[Obesity#Lifestyle|Obesity]] is caused by consuming too many [[calories]] compared to the amount of [[exercise]] the body is performing, causing a distorted [[energy balance (biology)|energy balance]].  It can lead to diseases such as [[cardiovascular disease#Risk factors|cardiovascular disease]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]]. Obesity is a condition in which the natural energy reserve, stored in the fatty tissue of humans and other mammals, is increased to a point where it is associated with certain health conditions or increased mortality.

The low-cost food that is generally affordable to the poor in affluent nations is low in nutritional value and high in fats, sugars and additives.  In rich countries, therefore, obesity is oftentimes a sign of poverty and malnutrition while in poorer countries obesity is more associated with wealth and good nutrition.  Other non-nutritional causes for obesity included: [[sleep]] deprivation, [[stress (biological)|stress]], lack of [[exercise]], and [[heredity]].

Acute [[overeating]] can also be a symptom of an [[eating disorder]].

[[Goitrogen]]ic foods can cause [[goitre]]s by interfering with [[iodine]] uptake.

=== Vitamins and micronutrients ===

[[Vitamin poisoning]] is the condition of overly high storage levels of vitamins, which can lead to toxic symptoms. The medical names of the different conditions are derived from the vitamin involved: an excess of vitamin A, for example, is called "[[hypervitaminosis A]]".

[[Iron overload disorder]]s are diseases caused by the overaccumulation of iron in the body. Organs commonly affected are the liver, heart and endocrine glands in the mouth.

==Deficiencies==

==Complex disorders==
In some cases, eating too much of one thing can induce an apparent deficiency of something else.  A common example occurs when [[livestock]] eat [[locoweed]]:  locoweed contains a toxin that inhibits  enzymes, simulating a deficiency of the enzymes.
