''' Kanematsu Sugiura''' (1890 &ndash; October 21, 1979 in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York]]) was a [[cancer]] researcher who spent his career at the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]. A pioneer in cancer research",<ref name=Hutchison1980/> he completed over 250 papers before his death. Sugiura received a number of awards and prizes throughout his life, and retired from the center in 1962. 

He is perhaps best known for his work on [[amygdalin|laetrile]], a controversial [[alternative cancer treatments|alternative cancer treatment]], which he was convinced had a palliative effect on certain mice tumors.<ref name=Hutchison1980>{{cite journal |author=Hutchison DJ |title=Kanematsu Sugiura 1890-1979 |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=40 |issue=7 |pages=2625–6 |year=1980 |month=July |pmid=6992988 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6992988}}</ref>

== Laetrile controversy ==
In 1972, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center board member Benno Schmidt convinced the hospital to test laetrile in order to assert its ineffectiveness "with some conviction".<ref name=Wade1977/> Sugiura found that laetrile inhibited [[secondary tumor]]s in mice, without destroying the [[primary tumor]], but in a [[blind test]] was unable to conclude that laetrile had anticancer activity. 

The initial positive results were not published because, in the words of Chester Stock, Sugiura's supervisor, ''it would have caused all kind of havoc''. Nevertheless, they were leaked in 1973, causing a stir. Consequently laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems, and a Sloan-Kettering press release concluded that ''laetrile showed no beneficial effects''.<ref name=Wade1977/> 

Three other researchers were unable to confirm Sugiura's results. Mistakes in the Sloan-Kettering press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents, led by Ralph Moss, former public affairs official of Sloan-Kettering hospital, who was fired when he announced his membership in the group. These mistakes were considered inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in ''Science'' noted that ''even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate.''<ref name=Wade1977>{{cite journal |author=Wade N |title=Laetrile at Sloan-Kettering: A Question of Ambiguity |journal=Science |volume=198 |issue=4323 |pages=1231–1234 |year=1977 |month=December |pmid=17741690 |doi=10.1126/science.198.4323.1231 |url=}}</ref> 

The results of all of the studies were published together in the ''Journal of Surgical Oncology''.<ref>Published in '' [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112720432/issue Journal of Surgical Oncology 10(2)]''.</ref>
