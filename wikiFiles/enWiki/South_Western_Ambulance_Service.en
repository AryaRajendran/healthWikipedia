The '''South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust''' (SWASFT) is the organisation responsible for providing [[ambulance]] services for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the English districts of [[Bristol]], [[Bath and North East Somerset]] [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[North Somerset]], [[Scilly Isles]] [[Somerset]], [[South Gloucestershire]] and [[Wiltshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swast.nhs.uk/What%20We%20Do/|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> The Foundation Trust was authorised on 1 March 2011 by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] (the Independent Regulator for NHS Foundation Trusts) to run the ambulance services run previously by the NHS Trust as a result of the merger of the Westcountry and Dorset ambulance services, and the subsequent merger with neighbouring [[Great Western Ambulance Service]] on 1 February 2013.

It is one of eleven [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|Ambulance Trusts]] providing England with [[emergency medical services]], receiving government funding for its role. There is no charge to patients for use of the service, although costs will be recovered and paid to the ambulance trust in cases of personal injury through the NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm  | title= NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme | publisher= Department of Health | accessdate= 10 November 2010}}</ref>

==Fire service co-responders==
[[Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service]], [[Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service]] and [[Dorset Fire and Rescue Service]] all work in partnership with South Western Ambulance service to provide emergency medical cover to particular areas of the Trust. These areas, often rural, have been identified as having a greater need for ambulance cover. Many of these areas do not have a local ambulance station. The aim of a co-responder teams is to preserve life until the arrival of either a Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) or an ambulance. Co-responder vehicles are equipped with oxygen and [[automated external defibrillator]] (AED) equipment supplied by South Western Ambulance Service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Responder Schemes|url=http://www.swast.nhs.uk/services/resp_fire.htm|publisher=South Western Ambulance Service|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>
