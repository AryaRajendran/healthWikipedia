A '''snakebite''' is an injury caused by a bite from a [[snake]], often resulting in puncture wounds inflicted by the animal's [[fang]]s and sometimes resulting in [[envenomation]]. Although the majority of snake species are non-venomous and typically kill their prey with [[constriction]] rather than [[snake venom|venom]], [[venomous snakes]] can be found on every continent except [[Antarctica]].<ref name="Kasturiratne"/> Snakes often bite their prey as a method of hunting, but also for defensive purposes against predators. Since the physical appearance of snakes may differ, there is often no practical way to identify a species and professional medical attention should be sought.<ref name="SVDK">{{Cite journal|year=2007 |title=Snake Venom Detection Kit: Detection and Identification of Snake Venom |publisher=CSL Limited|url=http://www.csl.com.au/docs/92/398/SVDK_Product_Leaflet,0.pdf|accessdate=2009-11-24 |quote=The physical identification of Australian and Papua New Guinean snakes is notoriously unreliable.

The outcome of snake bites depends on numerous factors, including the species of snake, the area of the body bitten, the amount of venom injected, and the health conditions of the person. Feelings of terror and panic are common after a snakebite and can produce a characteristic set of symptoms mediated by the [[autonomic nervous system]], such as a [[Tachycardia|racing heart]] and [[nausea]].<ref name="Gold2002"/><ref name="Kitchens1987"/> Bites from non-venomous snakes can also cause injury, often due to [[laceration]]s caused by the snake's teeth, or from a resulting infection. A bite may also trigger an [[anaphylactic]] reaction, which is potentially fatal. First aid recommendations for bites depend on the snakes inhabiting the region, as effective treatments for bites inflicted by some species can be ineffective for others.

The number of fatalities attributed to snake bites varies greatly by geographical area. Although deaths are relatively rare in [[Australia]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]],<ref name="Kasturiratne"/><ref name="Chippaux 1998">{{Cite journal |last=Chippaux |first=J.P. |year=1998 |title=Snake-bites: appraisal of the global situation |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=515–24 |url=http://www.kingsnake.com/aho/pdf/menu6/chippaux1998.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03|pmid=9868843|pmc=2305789}}</ref><ref name="Gutierrez2007"/> the morbidity and mortality associated with snake bites is a serious public health problem in many regions of the world, particularly in rural areas lacking medical facilities.

The most common symptoms of all snakebites are overwhelming fear, panic, and emotional instability, which may cause symptoms such as [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[fainting]], [[tachycardia]], and cold, clammy skin.<ref name="Gold2002"/><ref name="Kitchens1987">{{Cite journal| author=Kitchens C, Van Mierop L|title=Envenomation by the Eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius fulvius).

[[Dry bite|Dry snakebites]], and those inflicted by a non-venomous species, can still cause severe injury. There are several reasons for this: a snakebite may become infected with the snake's saliva and fangs sometimes harboring pathogenic microbial organisms, including ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''. Infection is often reported with viper bites whose fangs are capable of deep puncture wounds. Bites may cause [[anaphylaxis]] in certain people.

Most snakebites, whether by a venomous snake or not, will have some type of local effect. There is minor pain and [[Erythema|redness]] in over 90% of cases, although this varies depending on the site.<ref name="Gold2002"/> Bites by [[Viper (animal)|vipers]] and some [[cobra]]s may be extremely painful, with the local tissue sometimes becoming tender and severely [[Edema|swollen]] within 5 minutes.<ref name="Gutierrez2007"/> This area may also bleed and blister and can eventually lead to tissue [[ necrosis]]. Other common initial symptoms of [[pitviper]] and [[Viper (animal)|viper]] bites include lethargy, bleeding, weakness, nausea, and vomiting.<ref name="Gold2002"/><ref name="Gutierrez2007"/> Symptoms may become more life-threatening over time, developing into [[hypotension]], [[tachypnea]], severe tachycardia, severe internal bleeding, altered [[sensorium]], [[kidney failure]], and [[respiratory failure]].<ref name="Gold2002"/><ref name="Gutierrez2007"/>

Interestingly, bites caused by the [[Mojave Rattlesnake|Mojave rattlesnake]], [[kraits]], [[coral snake]], and the [[Crotalus mitchellii|speckled rattlesnake]] reportedly cause little or no pain despite being serious injuries.<ref name="Gold2002"/> Those bitten may also describe a "rubbery," "minty," or "metallic" taste if bitten by certain species of rattlesnake.<ref name="Gold2002"/> [[Spitting cobra]]s and [[rinkhals]]es can spit venom in a persons eyes.

== Pathophysiology ==
Since [[envenomation]] is completely voluntary, all venomous snakes are capable of biting without injecting venom into a person. Snakes may deliver such a "[[dry bite]]" rather than waste their venom on a creature too large for them to eat.<ref name="Young2002">{{Cite journal |last=Young |first=Bruce A. |coauthors=Cynthia E. Lee, Kylle M. Daley |year=2002 |title=Do Snakes Meter Venom? |journal=BioScience |volume=52 |issue=12 |pages=1121–26 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[1121:DSMV]2.0.CO;2 |quote=The second major assumption that underlies venom metering is the snake's ability to accurately assess the target }}</ref> However, the percentage of dry bites varies between species: 80% of bites inflicted by [[sea snakes]], which are normally timid, do not result in envenomation,<ref name="Phillips2002"/> whereas only 25% of [[Crotalinae|pitviper]] bites are dry.<ref name="Gold2002"/> Furthermore, some snake [[genera]], such as [[rattlesnake]]s, significantly increase the amount of venom injected in defensive bites compared to predatory strikes.<ref name="Young2001">{{Cite journal |last=Young |first=Bruce A. |coauthors=Krista Zahn |year=2001 |title=Venom flow in rattlesnakes: mechanics and metering |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=204 |issue=Pt 24 |pages=4345–4351|pmid=11815658 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/204/24/4345.pdf|quote=With the species and size of target held constant, the duration of venom flow, maximum venom flow rate and total venom volume were all significantly lower in predatory than in defensive strikes}}</ref>

Some dry bites may also be the result of imprecise timing on the snake's part, as venom may be prematurely released before the fangs have penetrated the person.<ref name="Young2002"/> Even without venom, some snakes, particularly large constrictors such as those belonging to the [[Boidae]] and [[Pythonidae]] families, can deliver damaging bites; large specimens often cause severe [[laceration]]s or the snake itself pull away, causing the flesh to be torn by the needle-sharp recurved teeth embedded in the person. While not as life-threatening as a bite from a venomous species, the bite can be at least temporarily debilitating and could lead to dangerous infections if improperly dealt with.

While most snakes must open their mouths before biting, African and Middle Eastern snakes belonging to the family [[Atractaspididae]] are able to fold their fangs to the side of their head without opening their mouth and jab a person.<ref name="Deufel2003">{{Cite journal |last=Deufel |first=Alexandra |coauthors=David Cundall |year=2003 |title=Feeding in Atractaspis (Serpentes: Atractaspididae): a study in conflicting functional constraints |journal=Zoology |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=43–61 |url=http://www.minotstateu.edu/biology/pdf/AtractaspisReprint.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-25 |doi=10.1078/0944-2006-00088 |pmid=16351890}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

=== Snake venom ===
{{Main|Snake venom}}
It has been suggested that snakes evolved the mechanisms necessary for venom formation and delivery sometime during the [[Miocene]] epoch.<ref name="Jackson2003">{{Cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Kate |year=2003|title=The evolution of venom-delivery systems in snakes |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=137 |issue=3 |pages=337–354 |doi=10.1046/j.1096-3642.2003.00052.x |url=http://www.kingsnake.com/aho/pdf/menu2/jackson2002.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref> During the mid-[[Tertiary]], most snakes were large [[ambush predator]]s belonging to the superfamily [[Henophidia]], which use constriction to kill their prey. As open grasslands replaced forested areas in parts of the world, some snake families evolved to become smaller and thus more agile. However, subduing and killing prey became more difficult for the smaller snakes, leading to the evolution of snake venom.<ref name="Jackson2003"/> Other research on [[Toxicofera]], a hypothetical [[clade]] thought to be ancestral to most living reptiles, suggests an earlier time frame for the evolution of snake venom, possibly to the order of tens of millions of years, during the [[Late Cretaceous]].<ref name="Fry2006">{{Cite journal |last=Fry |first=Bryan G.|coauthors=Nicolas Vidal, Janette A.

Snake venom is produced in modified [[parotid gland]]s normally responsible for secreting saliva. It is stored in structures called [[wikt:alveolus|alveoli]] behind the animal's eyes, and ejected voluntarily through its hollow tubular [[fangs]]. Venom is composed of hundreds to thousands of different [[protein]]s and [[enzymes]], all serving a variety of purposes, such as interfering with a prey's cardiac system or increasing tissue permeability so that venom is absorbed faster.

Venom in many snakes, such as pitvipers, affects virtually every organ system in the human body and can be a combination of many toxins, including [[cytotoxins]], [[hemotoxins]], [[neurotoxins]], and [[myotoxin]]s, allowing for an enormous variety of symptoms.<ref name="Gold2002"/><ref name="Russell1980a">{{Cite journal |last=Russell |first=Findlay E. |year=1980 |title=Snake Venom Poisoning in the United States |journal=Annual Review of Medicine |volume=31 |pages=247–59|doi=10.1146/annurev.me.31.020180.001335|pmid=6994610}}</ref> Earlier, the venom of a particular snake was considered to be one kind only i.e. either hemotoxic or neurotoxic, and this erroneous belief may still persist wherever the updated literature is hard to access. Although there is much known about the protein compositions of venoms from Asian and American snakes, comparatively little is known of Australian snakes.

The strength of venom differs markedly between species and even more so between families, as measured by [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) in mice. Subcutaneous LD<sub>50</sub> varies by over 140-fold within elapids and by more than 100-fold in vipers. The amount of venom produced also differs among species, with the [[Gaboon viper]] able to potentially deliver from 450–600 milligrams of venom in a single bite, the most of any snake.<ref name="Spawls">{{Cite book |title=The Dangerous Snakes of Africa |last=Spawls |first=Stephen |coauthors=Bill Branch |year=1997 |publisher=Southern Book Publishers |location=Johannesburg |isbn=1-86812-575-0 |page=192}}</ref> [[Opisthoglyphous]] colubrids have venom ranging from life-threatening (in the case of the boomslang) to barely noticeable (as in ''[[Tantilla]]'').

== Prevention ==
[[File:RodriguezParkHoustonSnakes.JPG|thumb|right|Sign at Sylvan Rodriguez Park in [[Houston, Texas]] warning of the presence of snakes.]]

Snakes are most likely to bite when they feel threatened, are startled, are provoked, or have no means of escape when cornered. Encountering a snake is always considered dangerous and it is recommended to leave the vicinity. There is no practical way to safely identify any snake species as appearances may vary dramatically.

Snakes are likely to approach residential areas when attracted by prey, such as [[rodents]]. Practising regular [[pest control]] can reduce the threat of snakes considerably. It is beneficial to know the species of snake that are common in local areas, or while travelling or hiking. Areas of the world such as [[Africa]], [[Australia]], the [[Neotropics]], and [[southern Asia]] are inhabited by many highly dangerous species. Being wary of snake presence and ultimately avoiding it when known is strongly recommended.

When in the wilderness, treading heavily creates ground vibrations and noise, which will often cause snakes to flee from the area. However, this generally only applies to [[North America]] as some larger and more aggressive snakes in other parts of the world, such as [[king cobra]]s<ref name="NG">{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/king-cobra/|title=National geographic- KING COBRA|quote= They are fiercely aggressive when cornered (line 28–29)}}</ref> and [[black mamba]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/black-mamba.html|title=National geographic-BLACK MAMBA|quote=when threatened, highly aggressive (line 2–3)}}</ref> will protect their territories. When dealing with direct encounters it is best to remain silent and motionless. If the snake has not yet fled it is important to step away slowly and cautiously.

The use of a flashlight when engaged in camping activities, such as gathering firewood at night, can be helpful. Snakes may also be unusually active during especially warm nights when ambient temperatures exceed {{convert|21|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. It is advised not to reach blindly into hollow logs, flip over large rocks, and enter old [[Log cabin|cabins]] or other potential snake hiding-places. When [[climbing|rock climbing]], it is not safe to grab ledges or crevices without examining them first, as snakes are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] and often sunbathe atop rock ledges.

In the United States more than 40% of people bitten by snake intentionally put themselves in harm's way by attempting to capture wild snakes or by carelessly handling their dangerous pets—40% of that number had a [[blood alcohol level]] of 0.1% or more.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kurecki B, Brownlee H|title=Venomous snakebites in the United States|journal=Journal of Family Practice|volume=25|issue=4|pages=386–92|year=1987|pmid=3655676}}</ref>

It is also important to avoid snakes that [[apparent death|appear to be dead]], as some species will actually roll over on their backs and stick out their tongue to fool potential threats. A snake's detached head can immediately act by [[reflex action|reflex]] and potentially bite. The induced bite can be just as severe as that of a live snake.<ref name="Gold2002"/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gold B, Barish R|title=Venomous snakebites. Current concepts in diagnosis, treatment, and management|journal=Emerg Med Clin North Am|volume=10|issue=2|pages=249–67|year=1992|pmid=1559468}}</ref>
Dead snakes are also incapable of regulating the venom they inject, so a bite from a dead snake can often contain large amounts of venom.<ref name="Suchard1999">{{Cite journal |last=Suchard |first=JR |coauthors=LoVecchio F. |year=1999|title=Envenomations by Rattlesnakes Thought to Be Dead |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=340 |issue=24 |page=1930|doi=10.1056/NEJM199906173402420 |pmid=10375322}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
It is not an easy task determining whether or not a bite by any species of snake is life-threatening. A bite by a North American [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] on the ankle is usually a moderate injury to a healthy adult, but a bite to a child's abdomen or face by the same snake may be fatal. The outcome of all snakebites depends on a multitude of factors: the size, physical condition, and temperature of the snake, the age and physical condition of the person, the area and tissue bitten (e.g., foot, torso, vein or muscle), the amount of venom injected, the time it takes for the person to find treatment, and finally the quality of that treatment.<ref name="Gold2002"/><ref name="Gold1994"/>

=== Snake identification ===
Identification of the snake is important in planning treatment in certain areas of the world, but is not always possible. Ideally the dead snake would be brought in with the person, but in areas where snake bite is more common, local knowledge may be sufficient to recognize the snake. However, in regions where polyvalent [[antivenom]]s are available, such as North America, identification of snake is not a high priority item. Attempting to catch or kill the offending snake also puts one at risk for re-envenomation or creating a second person bitten, and generally is not recommended.

The three types of venomous snakes that cause the majority of major clinical problems are [[Viper (animal)|vipers]], [[Bungarus|kraits]], and [[Naja|cobras]]. Knowledge of what species are present locally can be crucial, as is knowledge of typical signs and symptoms of envenomation by each type of snake. A scoring system can be used to try to determine the biting snake based on clinical features,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pathmeswaran A, Kasturiratne A, Fonseka M, Nandasena S, Lalloo D, de Silva H|title=Identifying the biting species in snakebite by clinical features: an epidemiological tool for community surveys|journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg|volume=100|issue=9|pages=874–8|year=2006|pmid=16412486|doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.10.003}}</ref> but these scoring systems are extremely specific to particular geographical areas.

=== First aid ===
Snakebite [[first aid]] recommendations vary, in part because different snakes have different types of venom. Some have little local effect, but life-threatening systemic effects, in which case containing the venom in the region of the bite by pressure immobilization is desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage around the bitten area, and immobilization may increase the severity of the damage in this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable remains a point of controversy. Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary.

However, most first aid guidelines agree on the following:

#Protect the person and others from further bites. While identifying the species is desirable in certain regions, risking further bites or delaying proper medical treatment by attempting to capture or kill the snake is not recommended.
#Keep the person calm. [[Acute stress reaction]] increases blood flow and endangers the person. [[Panic]] is infectious and compromises judgment.
#[[Call for help]] to arrange for transport to the nearest hospital [[emergency room]], where [[antivenom]] for snakes common to the area will often be available.
#Make sure to keep the bitten limb in a functional position and below the person's heart level so as to minimize blood returning to the heart and other organs of the body.
#Do not give the person anything to eat or drink. This is especially important with consumable alcohol, a known [[vasodilator]] which will speed up the absorption of venom. Do not administer [[stimulant]]s or [[Analgesics|pain medications]], unless specifically directed to do so by a physician.
#Remove any items or clothing which may constrict the bitten limb if it swells (rings, bracelets, watches, footwear, etc.)
#Keep the person as still as possible.
#Do not [[Incision|incise]] the bitten site.

Many organizations, including the [[American Medical Association]] and [[American Red Cross]], recommend washing the bite with soap and water. Australian recommendations for snake bite treatment recommend against cleaning the wound. Traces of venom left on the skin/bandages from the strike can be used in combination with a snake bite identification kit to identify the species of snake. This speeds determination of which antivenom to administer in the emergency room.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usyd.edu.au/anaes/venom/snakebite.html |title=Treatment of Australian Snake Bites |author=Chris Thompson |work=Australian anaesthetists' website}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

*Reassure the patient. 70% of all snakebites are from non- venomous species. Only 50% of bites by venomous species actually envenomate the patient
*Immobilise in the same way as a fractured limb. Use bandages or cloth to hold the splints, not to block the blood supply or apply pressure. Do not apply any compression in the form of tight ligatures, they don’t work and can be dangerous!
*Get to Hospital Immediately. Traditional remedies have '''no''' proven benefit in treating snakebite.
*Tell the doctor of any systemic symptoms, such as droopiness of a body part, that manifest on the way to hospital.

This therapy has two components: pressure to prevent lymphatic drainage, and immobilization of the bitten limb to prevent the pumping action of the [[skeletal muscle]]s.

Pressure is preferably applied with an elastic bandage, but any cloth will do in an emergency. Bandaging begins two to four inches above the bite (i.e. between the bite and the heart), winding around in overlapping turns and moving up towards the heart, then back down over the bite and past it towards the hand or foot. Then the limb must be held immobile: not used, and if possible held with a splint or sling. The bandage should be about as tight as when strapping a sprained ankle. It must ''not'' cut off blood flow, or even be uncomfortable; if it is uncomfortable, the person will unconsciously flex the limb, defeating the immobilization portion of the therapy. The location of the bite should be clearly marked on the outside of the bandages. Some peripheral [[edema]] is an expected consequence of this process.

Apply pressure immobilization as quickly as possible; if you wait until symptoms become noticeable you will have missed the best time for treatment. Once a pressure bandage has been applied, it should ''not'' be removed until the person has reached a medical professional.

=== Antivenom ===
Until the advent of [[antivenom]], bites from some species of snake were almost universally fatal.<ref name="INCHEM">{{cite web |last=White |first=Julian |title=Oxyuranus microlepidotus |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/animal/taipan.htm |date=November 1991 |publisher=Chemical Safety Information from Intergovernmental Organizations |quote=Without appropriate antivenom treatment up to 75% of taipan bites will be fatal. Indeed, in the era prior to specific antivenom therapy, virtually no survivors of taipan bite were recorded. |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> Despite huge advances in emergency therapy, antivenom is often still the only effective treatment for envenomation. The first antivenom was developed in 1895 by French physician [[Albert Calmette]] for the treatment of [[Indian cobra]] bites. Antivenom is made by injecting a small amount of venom into an animal (usually a horse or sheep) to initiate an immune system response. The resulting [[antibodies]] are then harvested from the animal's blood.

Antivenom is injected into the person [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], and works by binding to and neutralizing venom enzymes. It cannot undo damage already caused by venom, so antivenom treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Modern antivenoms are usually polyvalent, making them effective against the venom of numerous snake species. Pharmaceutical companies which produce antivenom target their products against the species native to a particular area. Although some people may develop serious adverse reactions to antivenom, such as [[anaphylaxis]], in emergency situations this is usually treatable and hence the benefit outweighs the potential consequences of not using antivenom.

The following treatments have all been recommended at one time or another, but are now considered to be ineffective or outright dangerous. Many cases in which such treatments appear to work are in fact the result of [[dry bite]]s.

In extreme cases, in remote areas, all of these misguided attempts at treatment have resulted in injuries far worse than an otherwise mild to moderate snakebite. In worst case scenarios, thoroughly constricting tourniquets have been applied to bitten limbs, completely shutting off blood flow to the area. By the time the person finally reached appropriate medical facilities their limbs had to be [[amputated]].
