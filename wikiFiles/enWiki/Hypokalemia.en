'''Hypokalemia''' ([[American English]]) or '''hypokalaemia''' ([[British English]]), also '''hypopotassemia''' or '''hypopotassaemia''' ([[ICD-9]]), refers to the condition in which the concentration of [[potassium]] (K<sup>+</sup>) in the blood is low. The prefix ''hypo-'' means "under" (contrast with ''hyper-'', meaning "over"); ''kal-'' refers to ''kalium'', the [[Neo-Latin]] for potassium, and ''-emia'' means "condition of the blood." 

Normal plasma potassium levels are between 3.5 to 5.0 [[mEq/L]];<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kratz | first1 = A | last2 = Ferraro | first2 = M | last3 = Sluss | first3 = PM | last4 = Lewandrowski | first4 = KB | last5 = Ellender | first5 = Stacey M. | last6 = Peters | first6 = Christine C. | last7 = Kratz | first7 = Alexander | last8 = Ferraro | first8 = Maryjane | last9 = Sluss | first9 = Patrick M. | title = Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

Mild hypokalemia is often without symptoms, although it may cause a small elevation of [[blood pressure]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krishna | first1 = GG | last2 = Miller | first2 = E | last3 = Kapoor | first3 = S | title = Increased blood pressure during potassium depletion in normotensive men | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 320 | issue = 18 | pages = 1177–82 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2624617 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198905043201804 }}</ref> and can occasionally provoke cardiac arrhythmias.  Moderate hypokalemia, with serum potassium concentrations of 2.5-3 mEq/L (Nl: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L), may cause muscular weakness, [[myalgia]], and muscle cramps (owing to disturbed function of the skeletal muscles), and constipation (from disturbed function of smooth muscles). With more severe hypokalemia, [[flaccid paralysis]] and [[hyporeflexia]] may result.  There are reports of [[rhabdomyolysis]] occurring with profound hypokalemia with serum potassium levels less than 2 mEq/L. [[Respiratory depression]] from severe impairment of skeletal muscle function is found in many patients.

Some electrocardiographic ([[ECG]]) findings associated with hypokalemia include '''flattened or inverted T waves''', a [[U wave]], ST depression and a wide PR interval. Due to prolonged repolarization of ventricular [[Purkinje fibers]], a prominent U wave occurs, that is frequently superimposed upon the T wave and therefore produces the appearance of a prolonged QT interval.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=M.J.|title=Principles of Clinical Electrocardiography 8th ed.|year=1973|publisher=LANGE medical Publications|location=Los Altos, California|page=293}}</ref>

==Causes==
Hypokalemia can result from one or more of the following [[medical]] conditions:

===Inadequate potassium intake===
* Perhaps the most obvious cause is insufficient [[eating|consumption]] of potassium (that is, a low-potassium diet) or starvation.  However, without excessive potassium loss from the body, this is a rare cause of hypokalemia.

===Gastrointestinal/integument loss===
* A more common cause is excessive loss of potassium, often associated with heavy fluid losses that "flush" potassium out of the body.  Typically, this is a consequence of [[diarrhea]], excessive [[perspiration]], or losses associated with surgical procedures.  Vomiting can also cause hypokalemia, although not much potassium is lost from the vomitus.  Rather, there are heavy urinary losses of K<sup>+</sup> in the setting of post-[[emesis|emetic]] bicarbonaturia that force urinary potassium excretion (see [[Hypokalemia#Alkalosis|Alkalosis]] below). Other GI causes include [[pancreatic fistula]]e and the presence of [[adenoma]].

===Urinary loss===
* Certain medications can cause excess potassium loss in the urine.  [[Diuretics]], including [[thiazide diuretic]]s (e.g. [[hydrochlorothiazide]]) and [[loop diuretic]]s (e.g. [[furosemide]]) are a common cause of hypokalemia.  Other medications such as the antifungal, [[amphotericin B]], or the cancer drug, [[cisplatin]], can also cause long-term hypokalemia.
* A special case of potassium loss occurs with [[DKA|diabetic ketoacidosis]].  In addition to urinary losses from [[polyuria]] and volume contraction, there is also obligate loss of potassium from kidney tubules as a [[cationic]] partner to the negatively charged [[ketone]], β-hydroxybutyrate.
* [[Hypomagnesemia]] can cause hypokalemia.  [[Magnesium]] is required for adequate processing of potassium.  This may become evident when hypokalemia persists despite potassium supplementation.  Other electrolyte abnormalities may also be present.
* [[Alkalosis]]{{Anchor|Alkalosis}} can cause transient hypokalemia by two mechanisms.  First, the alkalosis causes a shift of potassium from the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] and [[interstitial fluid]]s into cells; perhaps mediated by stimulation of [[Sodium-hydrogen antiporter|Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> exchange]] and a subsequent activation of [[NaKATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase]] activity.<ref name=Halperin>{{cite journal | last1 = Halperin | first1 = ML | last2 = Kamel | first2 = KS | title = Potassium | journal = Lancet | volume = 352 | issue = 9122 | pages = 135–40 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9672294 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)85044-7 }}</ref>  Second, an acute rise of plasma [[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]] concentration (caused by vomiting, for example) will exceed the capacity of the renal [[proximal tubule]] to reabsorb this [[anion]], and potassium will be excreted as an obligate [[cation]] partner to the bicarbonate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walmsley RN, White GH |title=Occult causes of hypokalaemia|journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1406–8 |year=1984 |month=August |pmid=6744598 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Metabolic alkalosis is often present in states of volume depletion, so potassium is also lost via [[aldosterone]]-mediated mechanisms.
* Disease states that lead to abnormally high [[aldosterone]] levels can cause hypertension and excessive urinary losses of potassium.  These include [[renal artery stenosis]] and [[tumors]] (generally non-malignant) of the [[adrenal]] glands, e.g., [[Conn's syndrome]] (primary hyperaldosteronism). Cushing's syndrome can also lead to hypokalemia due to excess cortisol binding the Na+/K+ pump and acting like aldosterone.  Hypertension and hypokalemia can also be seen with a deficiency of the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme which allows cortisols to stimulate aldosterone receptors.  This deficiency—known as [[apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome]]—can either be congenital or caused by consumption of [[glycyrrhizin]], which is contained in extract of licorice, sometimes found in [[herbal supplements]], [[candy|candies]] and chewing tobacco.
* Rare [[hereditary]] defects of renal salt transporters, such as [[Bartter syndrome]] or [[Gitelman syndrome]], can cause hypokalemia, in a manner similar to that of diuretics.  As opposed to disease states of primary excesses of aldosterone, blood pressure is either normal or low in Bartter's or Gitelman's.

===Distribution away from ECF===
* In addition to alkalosis, other factors can cause transient shifting of potassium into cells, presumably by stimulation of the Na-K-ATPase.<ref name=Halperin/>  These hormones and medications include [[insulin]], [[epinephrine]], and other [[Beta-adrenergic agonist|beta agonists]] (e.g. [[salbutamol]] or [[salmeterol]]), and [[xanthines]] (e.g. [[Theophylline]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whyte KF, Addis GJ, Whitesmith R, Reid JL |title=Failure of chronic theophylline therapy to alter circulating catecholamines |journal=Eur J Respir Dis |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=221–8 |year=1987 |month=April |pmid=3582518 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

* Rare [[hereditary]] defects of muscular ion channels and transporters that cause [[hypokalemic periodic paralysis]] can precipitate occasional attacks of severe hypokalemia and muscle weakness.  These defects cause a heightened sensitivity to the normal changes in potassium produced by [[catechols]] and/or [[insulin]] and/or [[thyroid hormone]], which lead to movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the muscle cells.

===Other/ungrouped===
* There have been a handful of published reports describing individuals with severe hypokalemia related to chronic extreme consumption (4-10 L/day) of [[cola]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tsimihodimos V, Kakaidi V, & Elisaf M. |title=Cola-induced hypokalaemia: pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical implications |journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=900–2 |year=2009 |month=June |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02051.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122384349/abstract |pmid=19490200}}[http://nerdoc.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/fulltext.pdf free full text]</ref>  The hypokalemia is thought to be from the combination of the [[diuretic]] effect of [[caffeine]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shirley DG, Walter SJ, Noormohamed FH |title=Natriuretic effect of caffeine: assessment of segmental sodium reabsorption in humans |journal=Clin.

===Pseudohypokalemia===
* Pseudohypokalemia is a decrease in the amount of potassium that occurs due to excessive uptake of potassium by metabolically active cells in a blood sample after it has been drawn. It is a laboratory artifact that may occur when blood samples remain in warm conditions for several hours before processing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sodi R, Davison AS, Holmes E, Hine TJ, Roberts NB |title=The phenomenon of seasonal pseudohypokalemia: effects of ambient temperature, plasma glucose and role for sodium-potassium-exchanging-ATPase |journal=Clin. Biochem. |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=813–8 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19232334 |doi=10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.01.024 |url=}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Potassium is essential for many body functions, including [[muscle]] and [[nerve]] activity. The electrochemical gradient of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular space is essential for nerve function; in particular, potassium is needed to repolarize the [[cell membrane]] to a resting state after an [[action potential]] has passed. Lower potassium levels in the extracellular space will cause hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. This [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] is caused by the effect of the altered potassium gradient on [[resting membrane potential]] as defined by the [[Goldman equation]]. As a result, a greater than normal stimulus is required for depolarization of the membrane in order to initiate an action potential. 

In the heart, hypokalemia causes hyperpolarization in the myocytes' resting membrane potential.  The more negative membrane potentials in the atrium may cause arrhythmias because of more complete recovery from sodium-channel inactivation, making the triggering of an action potential more likely.  In addition, the reduced extracellular potassium (paradoxically) inhibits the activity of the I<sub>Kr</sub> potassium current<ref>Sanguinetti MC and Jurkiewicz NK. (1992) Role of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in gating of cardiac delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> currents. Pflugers Arch., 420(2):180-6; PMID 1620577.</ref> and delays ventricular repolarization.  This delayed repolarization may promote [[cardiac arrhythmia|reentrant arrhythmias]].

==Treatment==
The most important treatment in severe hypokalemia is addressing the cause, such as improving the diet, treating [[diarrhea]] or stopping an offending medication. Patients without a significant source of potassium loss and who show no symptoms of hypokalemia may not require treatment.

Mild hypokalemia (>3.0 mEq/L) may be treated with oral potassium chloride supplements (Klor-Con, Sando-K, Slow-K). As this is often part of a poor nutritional intake, potassium-containing foods may be recommended, such as leafy green vegetables, [[tomato]]es, citrus fruits, [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s or [[banana]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umassmed.edu/uploadedFiles/SourcesDietaryPotassium.pdf |title=Umassmed.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> Both dietary and pharmaceutical supplements are used for people taking diuretic medications (see '''Causes''', above).

Severe hypokalemia (<3.0 mEq/L) may require [[intravenous]] (IV) supplementation. Typically, a [[saline (medicine)|saline]] solution is used, with 20-40 mEq KCl per liter over 3–4 hours. Giving IV potassium at faster rates (20-25 mEq/hr) may predispose to [[ventricular tachycardia]]s and requires intensive monitoring. A generally safe rate is 10 mEq/hr.  Even in severe hypokalemia, oral supplementation is preferred given its safety profile.  Sustained release formulations should be avoided in acute settings.  

Difficult or resistant cases of hypokalemia may be amenable to a potassium-sparing [[diuretic]], such as [[amiloride]], [[triamterene]], or [[spironolactone]] or [[eplerenone]].  Concomittant hypomagnesemia will inhibit potassium replacement as magnesium is a cofactor for potassium uptake.<ref name="Potassium Repletion and the Role of Magnesium">{{cite web |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/160/16/2429#SEC6 |title=New Guidelines for Potassium Replacement in Clinical Practice|work= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref>

When replacing potassium intravenously, infusion via a [[Central venous catheter|central line]] is encouraged to avoid the frequent occurrence of a burning sensation at the site of a peripheral IV, or the rare occurrence of damage to the vein.  When peripheral infusions are necessary, the burning can be reduced by diluting the potassium in larger amounts of IV fluid, or mixing 3 ml of 1% lidocaine to each 10 meq of KCl per 50 ml of IV fluid.  The practice of adding lidocaine, however, raises the likelihood of serious medical errors.<ref name="urlSafety Issues With Adding Lidocaine to IV Potassium Infustions (Excerpt)">{{cite web |url=http://www.ismp.org/newsletters/acutecare/articles/20040212_2.asp |title=Safety Issues With Adding Lidocaine to IV Potassium Infustions (Excerpt) |work= |accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref>
