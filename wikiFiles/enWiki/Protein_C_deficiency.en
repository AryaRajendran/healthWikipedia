'''Protein C deficiency''' is a rare genetic trait that predisposes to [[thrombosis|thrombotic disease]]. It was first described in 1981.<ref name="pmid6895379">{{cite journal |author=Griffin JH, Evatt B, Zimmerman TS, Kleiss AJ, Wideman C |title=Deficiency of protein C in congenital thrombotic disease |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1370â€“3 |year=1981 |pmid=6895379 |doi=10.1172/JCI110385 |pmc=370934}}</ref> The disease belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as [[thrombophilia]]s. The prevalence of protein C deficiency has been estimated to about 0.2% to 0.5% of the general population. Protein C deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of [[thrombosis|venous thromboembolism]] (relative risk 8-10), whereas no association with arterial thrombotic disease has been found.<ref name="pmid16968541">{{cite journal |author=Khan S, Dickerman JD |title=Hereditary thrombophilia |journal=Thromb J |volume=4 |issue= 1|pages=15 |year=2006 |pmid=16968541 |doi=10.1186/1477-9560-4-15 |url=http://www.thrombosisjournal.com/content/4/1/15 |pmc=1592479}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The main function of [[protein C]] is its anticoagulant property as an inhibitor of coagulation factors [[factor V|V]] and [[factor VIII|VIII]]. A deficiency results in a loss of the normal cleaving of Factors Va and VIIIa. There are two main types of protein C mutations that lead to protein C deficiency:<ref name="pmid16968541"/>
* '''Type I''': ''Quantitative'' defects of protein C (low production or short protein half life)
* '''Type II''': ''Qualitative'' defects, in which interaction with other molecules is abnormal. Defects in interaction with [[thrombomodulin]], phospholipids, factors V/VIII and others have been described.

The majority of people with protein C deficiency lack only one of the functioning genes, and are therefore [[heterozygous]]. Before 1999, only sixteen cases of ''[[homozygous]]'' protein C deficiency had been described (two abnormal copies of the gene, leading to absence of functioning protein C in the bloodstream). This may manifest itself as [[purpura fulminans]] in the newborn.<ref name="pmid16968541"/>

==Complications==
Protein C is vitamin K-dependent. Patients with Protein C deficiency are at an increased risk of developing skin necrosis while on warfarin. Protein C has a short half life (6hrs) compared with other vitamin K-dependent factors and therefore is rapidly depleted with warfarin initiation, resulting in a transient hypercoagulable state. 

==Treatment==
Primary prophylaxis with low-molecular weight heparin, heparin, or warfarin is often considered in known familial cases. Anticoagulant prophylaxis is given to all who develop a venous clot regardless of underlying cause.<ref name="Goldenberg">Goldenberg NA, Manco-Johnson MJ. Protein C deficiency. Haemophilia. 2008 Nov;14(6):1214-21</ref>

Studies have demonstrated an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolic events in patients with protein C deficiency. Therefore, long-term anticoagulation therapy with [[warfarin]] may be considered in these patients.<ref name="Goldenberg" />

Homozygous protein C defect constitutes a potentially life-threatening disease, and warrants the use of supplemental protein C concentrates.{{fact|date=April 2008}}

Liver transplant may be considered curative for homozygous protein C deficiency.<ref>Pediatr Transplant. 2009 Mar;13(2):251-4. Epub 2008 May 11.
