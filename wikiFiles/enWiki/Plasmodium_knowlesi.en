==History of discovery==

The first person to see ''P. knowlesi'' was  probably the Italian [[Giuseppe Franchiti]] in 1927 when he was examining the blood of ''[[Macaca fascicularis]]'' and he noted that it differed from ''[[Plasmodium cynomogli]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium inui]]''.<ref name=Franchini1927>Franchini G (1027) Su di un plasmodio pigmentato di una scimmia. Arch Ital Sci Med Colon 8:187–90</ref> It was later seen by Campbell in 1931 in a long-tailed macaque imported from Singapore to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in India. Campbell was interested in kala azar and was working under Napier. Napier [[Inoculation|inoculated]] the strain into three monkeys, one of which was a rhesus macaque (''[[Macaca mulatta]]''), which developed a fulminating infection. Knowing that the Protozoological Department were looking for a monkey malaria strain, they handed the original infected monkey to [[Biraj Mohan Das Gupta]], who was the assistant of [[Robert Knowles (parasitologist)|Robert Knowles]]. Dr Das Gupta maintained the species by serial passage in monkeys until Dr Knowles returned from leave. In 1932, Knowles and Das Gupta described the species in detail for the first time and showed that it could be transmitted to man by blood passage, but failed to name it. It was named by Sinton and Mulligan in 1932 after Dr Knowles.  From early in the 1930s to 1955, ''P. knowlesi'' was used as a [[fever|pyretic agent]] for the treatment of patients with [[neurosyphillis]].<ref name=Singh2004/>

In 1957, it was suggested by Garnham et al.<ref name="Garnham1957">{{cite journal | author=Garnham PCC, Lainson R, Cooper W |year=1957 |title= The tissue stages and sporogony of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' | journal = Trans Roy Soc Trop Med Hyg. |volume= 51 |issue=5 |pages=384–396 | doi=10.1016/0035-9203(57)90071-8 | pmid=13467997 }}</ref> that ''P. knowlesi'' could be the fifth species capable of causing endemic malaria in humans. 

In 1965, the first case of a naturally occurring infection of knowlesi malaria in humans was reported in an American man who had returned after working in the jungle in peninsular [[Malaysia]].<ref name=Haynes1988>{{cite journal | author = Haynes JD, Dalton JP, Klotz FW, McGinniss MH, Hadley TJ, Hudson DE, Miller LH |year=1988 |title=Receptor-like specificity of a Plasmodium knowlesi malarial protein that binds to Duffy antigen ligands on erythrocytes | journal = J Exp Med | volume=167|issue=6 |pages= 1873–1881 |pmid=2838562 | doi = 10.1084/jem.167.6.1873 | pmc = 2189679 }}</ref> Although the infecting parasite was initially identified as ''P. falciparum'', one day later it was then identified as ''P. malariae'' and it was only confirmed to be ''P. knowlesi'' after infected blood was used to inoculate Rhesus monkeys.<ref name=Singh2004/> A second report emerged in 1971 about the natural infection of a man in Malaysia with ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' followed by the description of a large focus of human infections in the Kapit Division of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.<ref name=Singh2004/> This was made possible due to the development of molecular detection assays which could differentiate between ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' and the morphologicall similar ''Plasmodium malariae.'' Since 2004, there has been an increasing number of reports of the incidence of ''P. knowlesi'' among humans in various countries in South East Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar and Indonesia.<ref name=Vythilingam2008>{{cite journal | author = Vythilingam I, Noorazian YM, Huat TC, Jiram AI, Yusri YM, Azahari AH, Norparina I, Noorrain A, Lokmanhakim S |year=2008|title=Plasmodium knowlesi in humans, macaques and mosquitoes in peninsular Malaysia | journal=Parasit Vectors|volume=1|issue=1 |page= 26 | pmid= 18710577 |doi=10.1186/1756-3305-1-26 | pmc = 2531168}}</ref>

Work with archival samples has shown that infection with this parasite has occurred in Malaysia at least since the 1990s<ref name=Lee>{{cite journal | author = Lee K.S., Cox-Singh J., Brooke G., Matusop A., Singh B |year=2009 |title = Plasmodium knowlesi from archival blood films: Further evidence that human infections are widely distributed and not newly emergent in Malaysian Borneo | journal = Int J Parasitol | doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.03.003 | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 1125–1128 | pmid = 19358848 | pmc = 2722692}}</ref> and it is now known to cause 70% of the malaria cases in certain areas of [[Sarawak]].<ref name=Daneshvar2009>{{cite journal | author = Daneshvar C. | year = 2009 | title = Clinical and Laboratory Features of Human ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' Infection |journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 49| issue= 6 |pages= 852&ndash;860 | doi = 10.1086/605439 | author-separator = , | author2 = Davis T.M.E. | author3 = Cox‐Singh J. | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Rafa’Ee | first4 = Mohammad Zakri | last5 = Zakaria | first5 = Siti Khatijah | last6 = Divis | first6 = Paul C. S. | last7 = Singh | first7 = Balbir}}</ref>

==Evolution==

Based on a Bayesian coalescent approach the most probable time of evolution of ''P. knowelsi'' is 257,000 years ago (95% range 98,000–478,000).<ref name="">{{cite journal | author = Lee KS, Divis PC, Zakaria SK, Matusop A, Julin RA, Conway DJ, Cox-Singh J, Singh B | year = 2011 | title = Plasmodium knowlesi: Reservoir Hosts and Tracking the Emergence in Humans and Macaques | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e1002015| pmid=21490952 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002015 | pmc = 3072369 | editor1-last = Kazura | editor1-first = James W. }}</ref>

==Life cycle==
''Plasmodium knowlesi'' parasite replicates and completes its blood stage cycle in 24 hour cycles<ref name=Cox-Singh/> resulting in fairly high loads of parasite densities in a very short period of time. This makes it a potentially very severe disease if it remains untreated. Life cycle: merozoite → trophozoites → schizont → merozoite. These stages of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' are microscopically indistinguishable from ''Plasmodium malariae'' and the early trophozoites are identical to those of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' .

Mosquito stages:<ref name=Manson/>
A mosquito ingests gametocytes, which have been formed in the mammalian host. These are either microgametocytes (which are male gametocytes) or macrogametocytes (which are female gametetocytes). These gametocytes mature into microgametes and macrogametes respectively, and then fertilize to form zygotes within the midgut of the mosquito. The zygotes mature into ookinetes, then into oocysts. Finally, the oocysts mature to release sporozoites which move to salivary gland of the mosquito.

Summary: gametocyte → (microgamete or macrogamete) → zygote → ookinete → oocyst → sporozoites.

In man: exoerythrocytic stage (in the liver):<ref name=Manson/> The sporozoites are injected into humans when the mosquito bites and they travel to the liver through blood stream and undergo asexual reproduction to become merozoites through schizonts in the liver cell. Hypnozoites in the liver has not yet been found.

Summary: sporozoites → schizonts → merozoites.

In man: erythrocytic stage (in the blood):<ref name=Manson/>
Merozoites are unleashed into the blood stream to infect erythrocytes constituting one asexual cycle of infection of the erythrocytes. Within the red blood cells some merozoites develop into trophozoites, which in turn mature into schizonts that rupture to release merozoites, while others develop into microgametocytes or macrogametocytes. These gametocytes remain in the blood to be ingested by mosquitoes.

Summary: Merozoite → trophozoite → schizont → merozoites.

==Epidemiology==
''P. knowlesi'' infection is normally considered a parasite of long-tailed (''[[Macaca fascicularis]]'') and pig-tailed (''[[Macaca nemestrina]]'') macaques <ref name=Vythilingam2008/><ref name=Ng>{{cite journal | author = Ng O.T., Ooi E.E., Lee C.C., Lee P.J., Ng L.C., Pei S.W., Tu T.M., Loh J.P., Leo Y.S. |year=2008|title= Naturally Acquired Human Plasmodium knowlesi Infection, Singapore |journal= Emerg. Infect. Dis.|volume= 14|issue=5 |pages= 814–816 | pmid= 18439370 | doi = 10.3201/eid1405.070863 | pmc = 2600232 }}</ref> but humans who work at the forest fringe or enter the rainforest to work are at risk of infection. With the increasing popularity of deforestation and development efforts in South East Asia, many macaques are now coming in close and direct contact with humans.<ref name=Vythilingam2008/> Hence more and more people who live in the semi-urban areas are being found to be infected with knowlesi malaria.

This parasite is mostly found in South East Asian countries particularly in [[Borneo]], [[Cambodia]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Khim N, Siv S, Kim S, Mueller T, Fleischmann E, Singh B, Divis PC, Steenkeste N, Duval L ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' infection in humans, Cambodia, 2007-2010 | url = | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 17 | issue = 10| pages = 1900–1902 }}</ref> [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]],<ref name="Jeslyn201">{{cite journal | author = Jeslyn WP, Huat TC, Vernon L, Irene LM, Sung LK, Jarrod LP, Singh B, Ching NL |year = 2010 |title= Molecular Epidemiological Investigation of Plasmodium knowlesi in Humans and Macaques in Singapore | journal = Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. | pmid = 20586605 | volume=11| issue = 2 |pages=131–5 | doi = 10.1089/vbz.2010.0024 | pmc = 3033207}}</ref> [[Thailand]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jongwutiwes S, Buppan P, Kosuvin R, Seethamchai S, Pattanawong U, Sirichaisinthop J, Putaporntip C | year = 2011 | title = ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' malaria in humans and macaques, Thailand | url = | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 17 | issue = 10| pages = 1799–1806 }}</ref> and neighboring countries and it appears to occur in regions that are reportedly free of the other four types of human malaria.

''Plasmodium knowlesi'' is absent in [[Africa]]. This may be because there are no long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques (the reservoir hosts of ''P. knowlesi'') in Africa and many West Africans  lack the [[Duffy antigen]] - a protein on the surface of the red blood cell that the parasite to uses to invade.

''P. knowlesi'' is the most common cause of malaria in childhood in the Kudat district of [[Sabah]], Malaysia.<ref name=Barber2011>{{cite journal | author = Barber BE, William T, Jikal M, Jilip J, Dhararaj P, Menon J, Yeo TW, Anstey NM | year = 2011 | title = Plasmodium knowlesi'' malaria in children | url = | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 814–820 | pmid = 21529389 | doi = 10.3201/eid1705.101489 }}</ref>

==Vectors==
Theoretically there are four modes of transmission: from an infected monkey to another monkey, from an infected monkey to a human, from an infected human to another human and from an infected human back to a monkey.<ref name=Vythilingam2008/> In practice human malaria appears to be almost entirely due to monkey to human transmission.

The known vectors belong to the genus ''[[Anopheles]]'', subgenus ''[[Cellia]]'', series ''[[Neomyzomyia]]'' and group ''[[Leucosphyrus]]''.<ref name=Cox-Singh/> Mosquitoes of this group are typically found in forest areas in South East Asia but with a greater clearing of forest areas for farmland, humans are increasingly becoming exposed to these vectors.

Within the monkey population in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], ''[[Anopheles hackeri]]'' is believed to be the main vector of ''P. knowlesi'': although ''A. hackeri'' is capable of transmitting malaria to humans,<ref name=Wharton>{{cite journal | author=Wharton RH, Eyles DE. | title=''Anopheles hackeri,'' a vector of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' in Malaya | year=1961 | journal=Science | volume=134 | pages=279–80 | doi=10.1126/science.134.3474.279 | pmid=13784726 | issue=3474}}</ref> it is not normally attracted to humans and seems unlikely to be an important vector for transmission to humans.<ref name=Reid>{{cite journal | author=Reid JA, Weitz B. | year=1961 | title=Anopheline mosquitoes as vectors of animal malaria in Malaya | journal=Ann Trop Med Parasitol | volume=55 | pages=180–6 | pmid=13740488}}</ref>

''[[Anopheles latens]]'' is attracted to both macaques and humans and has been shown to be the main vector transmitting ''P. knowlesi'' to humans in the Kapit Division of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.<ref name=Vythilingam2006>{{cite journal | author=Vythilingam I, Tan CH, Asmad M, Chan ST, Lee KS, Singh B. | title=Natural transmission of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' to humans by ''Anopheles latens'' in Sarawak, Malaysia | journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | year=2006 | volume=100 | pages=1087–88 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2006.02.006 | pmid=16725166 | issue=11 }}</ref>

''[[Anopheles cracens]]'' has also been reported as a vector of ''P. knowlesi.'' Both species of mosquitoes have been shown to contain as many as 1,000 sporozoites suggesting that they may be efficient vectors.<ref name=Vythilingam2008/>

A study of potential vectors in Malayasia suggests that ''[[Anopheles cracens]]'' may be an important vector of ''P. knowlesi''.<ref name=Jiram2012>Jiram AI, Vythilingam I, Noorazian YM, Yusof YM, Azahari AH, Fong MY (2012) Entomologic investigation of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' vectors in Kuala lipis, Pahang, Malaysia. Malar J 11(1):213</ref>

==Clinical==
Two possible modes of transmission to humans have been proposed: either from an infected monkey to a human or from an infected human to another human.

Symptoms typically begin approximately 11 days after an infected mosquito has bitten a person and the parasites can be seen in the blood between 10 – 12 days after infection.<ref name="Bronner2009">{{cite journal | author = Bronner U., Divis P.C., Farnert A., Singh B. |year=2009 |title= Swedish traveller with Plasmodium knowlesi malaria after visiting Malaysian Borneo |journal = Malar J. |volume=8 |page= 15 | pmid =19146706 |pmc=2634766 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-8-15}}.</ref> The parasite may multiply rapidly resulting in very high parasite densities that may be fatal.<ref name="Bronner2009" />

Although the current infection rate with ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' is relatively low, one risk it presents is misdiagnosis with other forms of malarial parasites such as ''P. malariae'' especially when microscopy is used. ''P. knowlesi'' can only be accurately distinguished from ''P. malariae'' using PCR assay and/or molecular characterization.

Symptoms of ''P. knowlesi'' in humans include headache, fever, chills and cold sweats.<ref name="Bronner2009"/> Singh ''et al.'' (2004)<ref name=Singh2004/> showed clinical symptoms in 94 patients with single species ''P. knowlesi'' infection at Kapit Hospital, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Symptoms included fever, chills, and rigor in 100% of patients, headache in 32%, cough in 18%, vomiting in 16%, nausea in 6%, and diarrhea in 4%. Asexual cycle of the parasite in humans and its natural host macaque is about 24 hours.<ref name=Chin/><ref name=Jongwutiwes/><ref name=Cox-Singh/> Hence the disease may be called quotidian malaria,<ref name=Chin/> in concert with designation of tertian malaria and quartan malaria.<ref name=Manson>Manson-Bahr PEC, Bell DR, eds. (1987). ''Manson's Tropical Diseases.'' London: Bailliere Tindall, ISBN 0-7020-1187-8.</ref> In addition to a lab diagnosis using PCR assay, knowlesi malaria may also present itself with elevated levels of C-reactive protein and thrombocytopenia.

This parasite causes non-relapsing [[malaria]]<ref name=Cogswell1992>{{cite journal | author = Cogswell F.B. |year=1992 |title= The hypnozoite and relapse in primate malaria |journal = Clin. Microbiol. Rev|volume=5 |issue = 1 |pages= 26–35 | pmid= 1735093 | pmc=358221 | doi=10.1128/CMR.5.1.26}}</ref> due to lack of hypnozoites in its exoerythrocytic stage.<ref name=Krotoski1982>{{cite journal | author = Krotoski W.A., Collins W.E. |year=1982 |title= Failure to detect hypnozoites in hepatic tissue containing exoerythrocytic schizonts of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' | journal= Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg.| volume= 31|issue=4 |pages= 854–856 | pmid= 7048949 }}</ref>

While infection with this organism is normally not serious, life threatening complications or even death may occur in a minority of cases. The most common complications are respiratory distress, abnormal liver function including jaundice and renal failure. Mortality in one series of cases was about 2%.<ref name="Daneshvar2009">Daneshvar C., Davis T.M., Cox-Singh J., Rafa'ee M.Z., Zakaria S.K., Divis P.C., Singh B. (2009) Clinical and laboratory features of human ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' infection. ''Clin. Infect. Dis.''</ref>

==Diagnosis==
''P. knowlesi'' infection is diagnosed by examining thick and thin blood films in the same way as other [[malaria]]s. The appearance of ''P. knowlesi'' is similar to that of ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'' and is unlikely to be correctly diagnosed except by using molecular detection assays<ref name=Singh2004/> in a malaria reference laboratory.

The morphology of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' is similar to that of ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]''. ''P. malariae'' is characterized by a compact parasite (all stages) and does not alter the host erythrocyte's shape or size or cause enlargement. Elongated trophozoites stretching across the erythrocyte, called band forms, are sometimes observed. Schizonts will typically have 8-10 merozoites that are often arranged in a rosette pattern with a clump of pigment in the center.<ref>http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/protozoology/notes/pl_sp.html#morph</ref>

Rapid diagnostic tests kits may or may not recognize ''P. knowlesi''  because of their specificity.

Currently PCR assay and molecular characterization are the most reliable methods for detecting and diagnosing ''P. knowlesi'' infection. PCR identifies the parasite DNA but this technique is not rapid and cannot be used for routine identification. PCR is also expensive and requires very specialized equipment.<ref name=Singh2004/>

==Treatment==
Because ''P. knowlesi'' takes only 24 hours to complete its erythrocytic cycle, it can result in very high parasite density quickly and may be fatal in humans. For this reason early treatment is advised.  It responds well to treatment with [[chloroquine]] and [[primaquine]].<ref name=Singh2004/> but if parasite counts are high and patients are severe, then infections should be treated as intensively as for severe falcipaum malaria.<ref name=Cox-Singh/>

In a clinical study of treatment where response was onserved after oral chloroquine was given for three days, and at 24 hours oral primaquine was administered for two consecutive days.,<ref name="Daneshvar2010">{{cite journal | author = Daneshvar C, Davis TM, Cox-Singh J, Rafa'ee MZ, Zakaria SK, Divis PC, Singh B |year=2010 |title = Clinical and parasitological response to oral chloroquine and primaquine in uncomplicated human Plasmodium knowlesi infections | journal = Malar.

This was more rapid that is found in ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' malaria where the median time to clearance is between six and seven hours.

==Pathology==

A single post mortem case has been described to date<ref name="Cox-Singh2010">{{cite journal | author = Cox-Singh J | year = 2010 | title = Severe malaria - a case of fatal Plasmodium knowlesi infection with post-mortem findings: a case report | url = | journal = Malar J | volume = 9 | issue = 1| page = 10 | pmid=20064229 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-9-10 | pmc = 2818646 | author-separator = , | author2 = Hiu J | author3 = Lucas SB | author4 = Divis PC | author5 = Zulkarnaen M | author6 = Chandran P | author7 = Wong KT | author8 = Adem P | author9 = Zaki SR | display-authors = 9 }}</ref> The patient was a male who became unwell 10 days after exposure. After four days he presented acutely unwell to a hospital. He was found to have a raised eosinophil count, to be [[thrombocytopaenic]], [[hyponatraemic]] with an elevated blood [[urea]], [[potassium]], [[lactate dehydrogenase]] and [[amino transferase]] values. [[Dengue]] fever was suspected but ruled out on investigation. Malarial parasites were seen on the blood film and later identified as ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' by PCR. At post mortum the [[liver]] and [[spleen]] were enlarged. The brain and [[endocardium]] showed multiple [[petechia]]l haemorrhages. The lungs had features consistent with [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]. Histological examination showed sequestration of pigmented parasitized red blood cells in the vessels of the [[cerebrum]], [[cerebellum]], [[heart]] and [[kidney]] without evidence of chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain or any other organ examined. The spleen and liver had abundant pigment containing macrophages and parasitized red blood cells. The kidney had evidence of acute tubular necrosis. Endothelial cells in heart sections were prominent. Brain sections were negative for intracellular adhesion molecule-1.

The overall post mortem picture was very similar to that found in cases of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. There were important differences including the absence of coma despite petechial haemorrhages and parasite sequestration in the brain.

==Notes==

There are at least two subspecies of ''P. knowlesi'' known - ''P. knowlesi edesoni'' and ''P. knowlesi knowlesi''. The subspecies ''P. knowlesi edesoni'' was described by Garnham in 1963.<ref name=Garnham1963>Garnham, PCC (1963) A new sub-species of ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' in the long-tailed macaque. J Trop Med & Hyg 66 : 156-158</ref> It was named after the parasitologist J F B Edeson. It is not known if there are any clinical differences between these two subspecies.
