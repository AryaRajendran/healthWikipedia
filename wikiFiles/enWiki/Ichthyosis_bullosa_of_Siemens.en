'''Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens''' is a rare skin disorder which is a type of familial, autosomal dominant [[ichthyosis]].<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>{{rp|491}}  It is also known as '''bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma of Siemens''' or '''ichthyosis exfoliativa'''.  It is a [[genetic disorder]] with no known cure which is estimated to affect about 1 in 500,000 people.<ref name="aog">Caputo, Ruggero and Tadini, Gianluca: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tYfEVty3cegC ''Atlas of Genodermatoses''], Page 19, Published by Taylor & Francis, 2005, ISBN 1-84184-251-6</ref>

==History==
Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (IBS) was first described by the German dermatologist [[Hermann Werner Siemens]] in 1937 from his study of an affected family.
<ref>Siemens, H.W.: "Dichtung und Wahrheit ueber die Ichthyosis bullosa, mit Bemerkungen zur
Systematik der Epidermolysen." Arch. Derm. Syph. 175: 590-608, 1937</ref>

In 1994 the gene causing IBS was discovered and it was also proved in the same year that ichthyosis exfoliativa is the same disease as IBS.

==Symptoms==
IBS has symptoms very similar to [[epidermolytic hyperkeratosis]] (EHK) but is generally milder than EHK. IBS affects only the upper layers of the epidermis whilst EHK affects the suprabasal layer which is deeper in the
skin.<ref name="tpd">Harper, John; Oranje, Arnold P. and Prose, Neil S.: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z0PEdterBCwC ''Textbook of Pediatric Dermatology''], Page 1110, Published by Blackwell Science, 2000, ISBN 0-86542-939-1</ref>

At birth the baby's skin has a red appearance like a sun burn (erythema). Blistering is usually present at birth and may be extensive or localized depending on the severity of the disease.<ref name="omim" />

Over the first few weeks the redness disappears and is replaced by dry, flaking skin on the arms, legs and around the belly button.<ref name="tod">Barnhill, Raymond L. and Crowson, A. Neil: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DWiE7fP6RmQC ''Textbook of Dermatopathology''], Page 349, Published by McGraw-Hill Professional, 2004, ISBN 0-07-139660-8</ref> Other areas of skin appear normal. The skin is fragile and is prone to blistering (caused by mild trauma or sweating).<ref name="tod" /> After a few months [[hyperkeratosis]] develops with a dark grey or brown, ridged appearance on the ankles, knees and elbows.<ref name="omim" /> Palms and soles are generally unaffected.<ref name="tpd" /> A slightly unpleasant, sweet odour may be present.<ref name="aog" />

A distinctive characteristic of IBS which is not present in other forms of ichthyosis is called the "Mauserung phenomenon" (Mauserung is German for "moulting" and was first described by H.W.Siemens). These are small patches of bare, apparently normal skin in the middle of areas of hyperkeratosis.<ref name="tpd" /><ref name="pip">Kirkham, Nigel and Lemoine, Nicholas R.: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lgx6sUZ7PmEC ''Progress in Pathology''], Page 107, Published by Cambridge University Press, 2001, ISBN 1-84110-050-1</ref>

As the sufferer ages the flaking and blistering should improve. The hyperkeratosis may grow more severe but more localized and is generally only present on flexural folds of the major joints.<ref name="omim" />

==Diagnosis==
Mild forms of IBS should be diagnosable from appearance and patient history alone. Severe cases of IBS are hard to distinguish from mild EHK. 

A [[skin biopsy]] shows a characteristic damaged layer in the upper spinous level of the skin. Again it may be difficult to distinguish from EHK.

The gene causing IBS is known and so a definite diagnosis can be given by [[genetic testing]].
<ref name="omim" />

==Genetics==
IBS is an autosomal dominant genetic condition caused by a mutation in the gene for [[Keratin 2A|keratin 2e]] on [[Chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12]].<ref name="omim" /><ref name="pmid7524919">{{cite journal

This means an affected person has a 50% chance of passing the condition on to their child. Around half of cases of IBS, however, have no parent with the condition and have the genetic fault due to a spontaneous mutation.

==Treatments==
There is no cure for IBS but in the future [[gene therapy]] may offer a cure.

Treatments for IBS generally attempt to improve the appearance of the skin and the comfort of the sufferer. This is done by exfoliating and increasing the moisture of the skin. Common treatments include:

* Emolients: moisturisers, petroleum jelly or other emolients are used, often several times a day, to increase the moisture of the skin.
* Baths: long baths (possibly including salt) several times a week are used to soften the skin and allow exfoliation.
* Exfoliating creams: creams containing keratolytics such as urea, salicylic acid and lactic acid may be useful.
* Antiseptic washes: antiseptics may be used to kill bacteria in the skin and prevent odour.
* Retenoids: very severe cases may use oral [[retinoids]] to control symptoms but these have many serious side effects including, in the case of IBS, increased blistering.<ref>Vahlquist, Anders and Duvic, Madeleine: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mbEBAEAaOKgC ''Retinoids and Carotenoids in Dermatology''], Page 160, Published by CRC Press, 2007, ISBN 0-8493-3992-8</ref>
