The '''sacrococcygeal [[symphysis]]''' ('''sacrococcygeal articulation''', '''articulation of the sacrum and coccyx''') is an [[Amphiarthrosis|amphiarthrodial]] joint, formed between the oval surface at the apex of the [[sacrum]], and the base of the [[coccyx]]. 

It is a slightly moveable joint<ref name="Morris-59">Morris (2005), p 59</ref> which is frequently, partially or completely, obliterated in old age,<ref name="Palastanga-334">Palastanga (2006), p 334</ref> [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the joints between the bodies of the [[vertebrae]].

== Disc ==
The [[sacrococcygeal disc]] or '''interosseus ligament'''<ref name="Huijbregts-13">Huijbregts (2001), p 13</ref> is similar to the [[intervertebral disc]]s<ref name="Palastanga-334" /> but thinner, thicker in front and behind than at the sides, and with a firmer texture.<!--- From Gray's ---> The articular surfaces are elliptical with longer transversal axes.  The surface on the sacrum is convex and that on the coccyx concave.<ref name="Palastanga-334" />  Occasionally the coccyx is freely movable on the sacrum, most notably during [[pregnancy]]; in such cases a [[synovial membrane]] is present.<!--- From Gray's --->

== Ligaments ==
The joint is strengthened by a series of ligaments:
* The '''ventral''' or '''[[anterior sacrococcygeal ligament]]''' is an extension of the [[anterior longitudinal ligament]] (ALL) that runs down along the spine on the anterior sides of the [[Body of vertebra|bodies of the vertebrae]].  It consists of a few irregular fibers that attach to the anterior sides of the sacrum and coccyx and blend with the [[periosteum]].<ref name="Morris-59" />
* The '''dorsal''' or '''[[posterior sacrococcygeal ligament]]''' has a deep and a superficial part:
** The '''deep dorsal ligament''' is a flat band which corresponds to the [[posterior longitudinal ligament]] (PLL) that run down inside the [[vertebral canal]] on the posterior surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae.  From the posterior side of the fifth sacral body inside the sacral canal, the dorsal ligament stretches to the posterior side of the coccyx, to attach deep to the superficial dorsal ligament.<ref name="Morris-59" />
** The '''superficial dorsal ligament''' corresponds to the [[ligamenta flava]] and closes the posterior aspect of the distal end of the vertebral canal.<ref name="Morris-59" />  It stretches from [[median sacral crest]]<ref name="Huijbregts-13" /> and the free margin of the [[sacral hiatus]]<ref name="Morris-59" /> to the dorsal surface of the coccyx.<ref name="Morris-59" />
<!--- <ref name="Masquelet-6">Masquelet (1993), p 6</ref> --->
* The '''[[lateral sacrococcygeal ligament]]s''' run from the lower lateral angles of the sacrum to the [[transverse process]]es of the first coccygeal vertebra to complete the [[foramina]] for the [[Sacral spinal nerve 5|last sacral nerve]].<ref name="Morris-59" />  Three lateral ligaments have been reported on either side.<ref name="Huijbregts-13" />
* The '''interarticular''' or '''[[intercornual sacrococcygeal ligament]]s''' stretches from the [[cornu]] of the sacrum to the cornu of the coccyx.<ref name="Morris-59" />

== Movements ==
Movements in the joint are restricted to [[flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]].  These essentially passive movements occurs during [[defecation]] and [[Childbirth|labour]].  When movements in the sacrum increase the anteroposterior diameter of the [[pelvic outlet]], movements in the sacrococcygeal joint can further increase this diameter.<ref name="Palastanga-334" />

== Palpation ==
The joint is [[palpation|palpable]] deep within the [[Gluteal cleft|natal cleft]], and can be felt as a horizontal groove.  With the palpating finger on the dorsal surface of the coccyx, a degree of rotation can be produced with an applied forward pressure.<ref name="Palastanga-334" />
