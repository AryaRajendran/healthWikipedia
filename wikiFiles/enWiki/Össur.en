Össur was founded in Iceland in 1971 by Össur Kristinsson, a [[prosthetist]]. His family owned the company until 1999, when it went public and was listed on the [[Iceland Stock Exchange]]. Initially, the company served only the domestic Icelandic market, and then began to export in 1986. There was expansion in the 1990s and an acquisition strategy{{Clarify|date=January 2009}} in the 2000s. Össur grew from being a prosthetics workshop with a few employees to a [[high-tech]] company that employs a staff of around 1,600 in 14 locations around the world.

===Products===
Össur operates in three markets: bracing & support, compression therapy, and prosthetics. Össur’s [[bionics|Bionic]] [[Technology]] Platform is a part of the prosthetics market.

====Bracing and support====
Össur manufactures a range of [[brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] and support products for [[arm]]s, [[human leg|leg]]s, and [[torso]]. Products include [[Unloader One]], a brace that provides a mechanical solution to knee [[pain]] caused by [[osteoarthritis]]. It separates bones when ligaments and [[cartilage]] are damaged and also prevents further damage to the [[joint]]. The firm also makes the CTi (formerly sold as the CTi2), a [[ligament]] brace for knees used for both rehabilitation and for injury prevention, as well as [[cervical collar]]s.

====Compression therapy====
Össur entered the [[cold compression therapy|compression therapy]] segment with the acquisition of the French company Gibaud. Products include [[bandage]]s, [[tights]], [[stocking]]s, [[knee highs]] and stump socks.

====Prosthetics====
Össur manufactures prosthetic [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and joints, liners, sockets, locks and sleeves. Its products include Flex-Foot, a high performance foot made from 100% [[carbon fiber]], a material used extensively in the [[aerospace]] industry for its strength and flexibility. The Flex-Foot Cheetah developed by medical engineer [[Van Phillips (inventor)|Van Phillips]] and worn by [[Oscar Pistorius]] and other amputee athletes is a derivative of this product line. Össur also produces the Total Knee prosthetic, which possesses a "locking moment" which keeps the [[knee]] from collapsing when it is in full extension, Mauch Knee, which has a [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] system for fluid and natural [[gait]], and Iceross [[silicone]] prosthetic liners, which provide an interface between the [[skin]] and the socket.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

=====Bionic Technology Platform=====
This platform focuses on restoring the [[anatomical]] function displaced by [[amputation]] by using intelligent structures in products that can respond in a human-like way. The division's products are Rheo Knee, a [[microprocessor]] swing and stance [[knee]] system which utilizes [[artificial intelligence]], Power Knee, which works as an integrated extension of its user, synchronizing motion with that of the sound leg using motor power, and Proprio Foot, an intelligent and motor-powered foot module.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

==Sponsorship==
The firm's Team Össur comprises international athletes and performers and professionals who use Össur prosthetics. Under this program, Össur is a major sponsor of disabled athletes, including [[Paralympian]]s and [[world record]] holders [[Oscar Pistorius]], [[Sarah Reinertsen]], [[Jody Cundy]]  and [[Rudy Garcia-Tolson]]. The company has also sponsored Paralympian runner Brian Frasure, now a certified prosthetist and mentor to Oscar Pistorius, and Mike McNaughton, a [[Staff Sergeant]] in the [[Louisiana Army National Guard]] who lost his leg to a land mine in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and was subsequently awarded a [[Bronze Star]] and a [[Purple Heart]].
