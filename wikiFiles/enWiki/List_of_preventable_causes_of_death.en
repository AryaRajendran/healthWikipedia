The [[World Health Organization]] has traditionally classified death according to the primary type of [[disease]] or [[injury]]. However, causes of death may also be classified in terms of preventable risk factors—such as smoking, unhealthy diet, and sexual behavior—which contribute to a number of different diseases. Such risk factors are usually not recorded directly on death certificates.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Preventable causes of death in North Carolina |journal=N C Med J |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=196 |year=2002 |pmid=12970957 |doi= |url=http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/jul-aug-02/numbers.pdf}}</ref>

==Leading causes worldwide==
It is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/> In industrialized nations the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011">{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011}}</ref> Thus, albeit indirectly, [[biological aging]] ([[Wiktionary:Senescence|senescence]]) is by far the leading cause of death. Whether senescence as a biological process itself can be slowed down, halted or even reversed, is a subject of current scientific speculation and research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sens.org/ |title=SENS Foundation}}</ref>

In 2001, on average 29 000 children died of preventable causes each day (that is, about 20 deaths per minute). The authors provide the context: 
{{Cquote|About 56 million people died in 2001. Of these, 10.6 million were children, 99% of whom lived in low-and-middle-income countries. More than half of child deaths in 2001 were attributable to acute respiratory infections, measles, diarrhoea, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.<ref name=Lopez/>}}
