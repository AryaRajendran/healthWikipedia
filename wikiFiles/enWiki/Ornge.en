'''Ornge''' (formerly Ontario Air Ambulance) is the [[air ambulance]] service for the province of [[Ontario]] and for the [[Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Ontario)]]. The provision of ambulance services in Ontario is governed by the Ambulance Act, which states that the Minister of Health "has the duty and the power" to make sure Ontario is serviced by a "balanced and integrated system of ambulance services and communication services used in dispatching ambulances”.<ref>{{Cite Canadian Court

The name Ornge is not an acronym, but is based on the colour orange of its aircraft and land ambulances. According to the organization, "The 'a' was removed from the name, partly to make people stop and take a second look, and also so that it could be [[trademark]]ed."<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web|url = http://www.ornge.ca/Media/Pages/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.aspx|title = Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate = 3 February 2012|last = Ornge|date = 2009}}</ref>

==History==

The [[air ambulance]] program was established in&nbsp;1977 to serve remote areas, primarily in [[Northern Ontario]], that are inaccessible to [[ambulance|land ambulance]]s or that land ambulances would take too long to reach. Ontario was the first [[Canadian province]] to provide a [[helicopter]]-based air ambulance system to transport critically ill patients to hospital. Air ambulances are also used to transport medical teams and organs for transplant. A large part of the air ambulance service is involved in serving aboriginal communities, of which there are approximately&nbsp;117, in 6 treaty areas of [[Northern Ontario]]. <ref>http://www.nosm.ca/communities/aboriginal_affairs/general.aspx?id=4082</ref>

The Ministry operated an air ambulance dispatch centre in Toronto until Ornge took over and MATC (Medical Air Transport Centre) became the Ornge Communications Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ornge.ca/Programs/Pages/OrngeCommunicationsCentre.aspx |title=Ornge Communications Centre |publisher=Ornge.ca |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref>
   
Today, the air ambulance program has become an integral component of the larger emergency health system in communities across the province.<ref>http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/program/ehs/air/air_mn.html</ref>

===December 2011-February 2013- financial scandal and police investigation===
In&nbsp;2011 Ornge was involved in a controversy regarding executives compensation, including President and CEO Chris Mazza. Mazza went on an indefinite medical leave on 22&nbsp;December&nbsp;2011 at the height of the scandal. The [[Toronto Star]] uncovered that Mazza was receiving $1.4&nbsp;million a year while remaining off the "sunshine list" of public employees earning over&nbsp;$100,000. That salary makes him the highest publicly paid official in the province. Ontario Health Minister [[Deb Matthews]] stated that Mazza’s salary was "outrageous, shocking and unacceptable". Ornge Global, Ornge's for-profit division, also received $6.7&nbsp;million in a contract from Anglo-Italian helicopter manufacturer [[AgustaWestland]], which is also part of the audit by the provincial auditor general.<ref name="Star22Dec11">{{Cite news|url = http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1105806--ornge-president-was-paid-1-4-million-per-year|title = ORNGE president was paid $1.4 million per year|accessdate = 2 February 2012|last = Donovan|first = Kevin|date = 22 December 2011| work = [[Toronto Star]]}}</ref> [[Ron McKerlie]], who was at the time Deputy Minister for the Ministry of Government Services, Associate Secretary of Cabinet and Secretary of Management Board of Cabinet for the Government of Ontario, was appointed as the Interim President and CEO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caw2002tca.ca/NewsRoom/lewenza-tells-ornge-to-look-after-its-internal-customers.aspx |title=CAW - Lewenza tells ORNGE to look after its internal customers |publisher=Caw2002tca.ca |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref>

As the scandal spread on 24&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012 Ornge fired 18&nbsp;managers and closed the ''J Smarts'' charity program. The next day a new board of directors was named, including former provincial cabinet minister [[Charles Harnick]]. A complete forensic audit was also started. On 2&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012 Ornge President and CEO Chris Mazza was fired without compensation, as was the chief operating officer of ORNGE&nbsp;Global, Maria Renzella. ORNGE&nbsp;Global&nbsp;GP&nbsp;Inc. and ORNGE Global Holdings&nbsp;LP were placed in bankruptcy under the oversight of a trustee. The bankruptcy move does not affect the provincial air ambulance service, which is operated separately.<ref name="Star24Jan12">{{Cite news|url = http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1120844--ornge-lets-18-go-shutters-charitable-entity|title = ORNGE lets 18 go, shutters charitable entity|accessdate = 2 February 2012|last = Donovan|first = Kevin|date = 24 January 2012| work = [[Toronto Star]]}}</ref><ref name="Star25Jan12">{{Cite news|url = http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1121377--ornge-names-new-board-of-directors|title = ORNGE names new board of directors|accessdate = 2 February 2012|last = Ferguson |first = Rob|date = 2 February 2012| work = [[Toronto Star]]}}</ref><ref name="Star02Feb12">{{Cite news|url = http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1125487--founder-of-ornge-chris-mazza-is-fired|title = Founder of ORNGE Chris Mazza fired|accessdate = 2 February 2012|last = Donovan|first = Kevin|date = 2 February 2012| work = [[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>

On 2&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012, the Ontario Health Minister Deb Mathews stated, "Today, the for-profit ORNGE Global&nbsp;GP&nbsp;Inc. and ORNGE Global Holdings&nbsp;LP went into receivership, essentially ending their existence. As a result, Dr.&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;Mazza, president and CEO, and Maria Renzella, chief operating officer, have been terminated and ORNGE has advised us that no severance has been offered. These are vitally important and necessary steps needed to restore the confidence of Ontarians in the leadership team responsible for Ontario’s air ambulance service. The forensic audit continues and we look forward to their findings and the auditor general’s value-for-money audit. We continue to seek and support the changes at ORNGE and continue to work with the new leadership as they strengthen Ontario’s air ambulance service."<ref name="Star02Feb12" />

On 16&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012 Ornge formally became the subject of an [[Ontario Provincial Police]] investigation for "financial irregularities". Neither the police, Mathews nor Ornge would provide details about the nature of the investigation. The minister indicated it was as a result of the preliminary findings of the forensic auditors in examining the organization's financial records. Aside from the police investigation there are two other investigations underway. The Ministry of Health's emergency health services branch is carrying out an investigation of 13&nbsp;incidents related to air ambulance operations, three of which involve the deaths of patients. Also provincial Auditor General Jim McCarter is investigating Ornge and will present his final report in March&nbsp;2012.<ref name="CBC17Feb12">{{cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/02/17/ontario-ornge-.html|title = Minister tightens leash on ORNGE Health minister to boost oversight at air ambulance service under investigation by police|accessdate = 18 February 2012|last = CBC News|date = 17 February 2012| work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

On 17&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012, amidst calls for her resignation from the opposition, Ontario Health Minister, Deb Mathews announced that the government would greatly tighten control over Ornge, including new legislation and a new performance agreement to increase oversight and limit what it can do without government approval, including preventing the sale of assets, such as helicopters and the taking on of debt.<ref name="CBC17Feb12" />

On 23&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012 allegations surfaced of unqualified staff running the air ambulance service and of a questionable $14,000&nbsp;payout to a [[Brazil]]ian law firm by an Ornge spin-off company. More information became available about the nature of the OPP&nbsp;investigation, including that the subject is alleged kick-back payments for helicopter purchases as well as interest-free loans and cash advances from Ornge to Mazza. Filed bankruptcy documents indicate that Mazza is a creditor of one of Ornge's now-defunct for-profit companies and that he is owed $1&nbsp;in the proceedings. The opposition continued calls for the minister's resignation as news of medevac operation disruptions in recent weeks surfaced.<ref name="Talaga23Feb12">{{cite news|url = http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1136022--ornge-fallout-now-includes-brazilian-law-firm?bn=1|title = ORNGE fallout now includes Brazilian law firm|accessdate = 24 February 2012|last = Talaga|first = Tanya and Kevin Donovan|date = 23 February 2012| work = [[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>

On 21&nbsp;March&nbsp;2012 provincial Auditor General Jim McCarter released a report that heavily criticized the provincial government for lack of oversight of Ornge's operations. The report details that the government paid Ornge C$700&nbsp;million over five years and that Ornge also borrowed an additional C$300&nbsp;million for aircraft purchases. The report details how air ambulance costs increased 20% while transporting 6% fewer patients. McCarter reported how Ornge, "soon begame a mini-conglomerate" with virtually no government supervision. He stated, "Of particular concern to us was the fact that certain of these companies were owned by Ornge's president, senior members of its management team and its board of directors. To the nose of this watchdog, this didn't pass the smell test." The report also details how Ornge bought more aircraft than it needed with government money with the aim of renting them out. Health Minister Deb Matthews said that the province will act on all of McCarter's recommendations.<ref name="CBC21Mar12">{{cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/03/21/toronto-matthews-ornge.html|title = Ornge overspending slammed by Ontario auditor general|accessdate = 21 March 2012|last = CBC News|date = 21 March 2012| work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

On 9&nbsp;February&nbsp;2013 Dr. Chris Mazza received $4.6 million dollars in public dollars in his last two years at Ornge, including salary, bonuses, cash advances and two housing loans. The police investigation continues. <ref> [[Toronto Star]] February 9, 2013</ref>
