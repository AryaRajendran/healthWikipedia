'''Thyroid neoplasm''' is a [[neoplasm]] or [[tumor]] of the [[thyroid]]. It can be a [[benign tumor]] such as [[thyroid adenoma]], <ref name=Kumar20> Chapter 20 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition. </ref> or it can be a [[malignant neoplasm]] ([[thyroid cancer]]), such as [[papillary thyroid cancer|papillary]], [[follicular thyroid cancer|follicular]], [[medullary thyroid cancer|medullary]] or [[anaplastic thyroid cancer]].<ref name=hu>Hu MI, Vassilopoulou-Sellin R, Lustig R, Lamont JP.

==Diagnosis==
{{See|Thyroid nodule}}
The first step in diagnosing a thyroid neoplasm is a physical exam of the neck area. If any abnormalities exist, a doctor needs to be consulted. A family doctor may conduct blood tests, an [[ultrasound]], and nuclear scan as steps to a diagnosis.  The results from these tests are then read by an endocrinologist who will determine what problems the [[thyroid]] has.
[[Hyperthyroidism]] and [[hypothyroidism]] are two conditions that often arise from an abnormally functioning [[thyroid gland]].  These occur when the [[thyroid]] is producing too much or too little [[thyroid hormone]] respectively.<ref name=na/>

[[Thyroid nodule]]s are a major presentation of thyroid neoplasms, and are diagnosed by ultrasound guided [[fine needle aspiration]] (USG/FNA) or frequently by [[thyroidectomy]] (surgical removal and subsequent histological examination). FNA is the most cost-effective and accurate method of obtaining a [[biopsy]] sample.<ref>Schmitt, Fernando. "Thyroid Cytology: Is FNA Still The Best Diagnostic Approach?"''International Journal of Surgical Pathology'',June 2010,vol 18, p.201-204.</ref> As thyroid cancer can take up [[iodine]], [[radioactive iodine]] is commonly used to treat thyroid carcinomas, followed by [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] suppression by high-dose [[thyroxine]] therapy.

[[Nodule (medicine)|Nodules]] are of particular concern when they are found in those under the age of 20. The presentation of benign nodules at this age is less likely, and thus the potential for malignancy is far greater.

==Classification==
Thyroid neoplasm might be classified as benign or malignant.
===Benign neoplasms===
[[Thyroid adenoma]] is a benign neoplasm of the thyroid.  [[Thyroid nodules]] are very common and around 80 percent of adults will have at least one by the time they reach 70 years of age.  Approximately 90 to 95 percent of all nodules are found to be benign.<ref name=na/>
===Malignant neoplasms===
{{main|Thyroid cancer}}
Thyroid cancers  are mainly [[papillary thyroid cancer|papillary]], [[follicular thyroid cancer|follicular]], [[medullary thyroid cancer|medullary]] or [[anaplastic thyroid cancer]].<ref name=hu>Hu MI, Vassilopoulou-Sellin R, Lustig R, Lamont JP. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter05/article/10165/1402668 "Thyroid and Parathyroid Cancers"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> Most patients are 25 to 65 years of age when first diagnosed; women are more affected than men.<ref name=hu/><ref>Al-Zaher N, Al-Salam S, El Teraifi H. Thyroid carcinoma in the United Arab Emirates: perspectives and experience of a tertiary care hospital. Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther 2008;1:14-21. [http://www.hemoncstem.net "Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Therapy"]</ref> Nearly 80 percent of [[thyroid cancer]] is [[Papillary thyroid cancer|papillary]] and about 15 percent is [[follicular]]; both types grow slowly and can be cured if caught early. [[Medullary thyroid cancer]] makes up about 3 percent of this cancer. It grows slowly and can be controlled if caught early.  [[Anaplastic]] is the most deadly and makes up around 2 percent.  This type grows quickly and is hard to control.<ref name=na/>  The classification is determined by looking at the sample of cells under a [[microscope]] and by which type of [[thyroid]] cell is present.
Other thyroid malignancies include thyroid lymphoma, various types of thyroid sarcoma, smooth muscle tumors, teratoma, squamous cell thyroid carcinoma and other rare types of tumors.<ref>{{cite book |author=DeLellis R.A., Lloyd R.V., Heitz P.U., Eng C.

==Treatment==
Treatment of a [[thyroid nodule]] depends on many things including size of the nodule, age of the patient, the type of [[thyroid cancer]], and whether or not it has spread to other tissues in the body.
If the nodule is benign, patients may receive thyroxine therapy to suppress [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] and should be reevaluated in 6 months.<ref name=hu/>  However, if the benign nodule is inhibiting the patient's normal functions of life; such as breathing, speaking, or swallowing, the [[thyroid]] may need to be removed.

Sometimes only part of the thyroid is removed in an attempt to avoid causing hypothyroidism.  There's still a risk of hypothyroidism though, as the remaining thyroid tissue may not be able to produce enough hormones in the long-run.  

If the nodule is malignant or has indeterminate cytologic features, it may require surgery.<ref name=hu/>  A [[thyroidectomy]] is a medium risk surgery that can result complications if not performed correctly.  Problems with the voice, nerve or muscular damage, or bleeding from a lacerated blood vessel are rare but serious complications that may occur.  After removing the [[thyroid]], the patient must be supplied with a replacement [[hormone]] for the rest of their life.  This is commonly a daily oral medication prescribed by their [[endocrinologist]].  
 
Radioactive [[Iodine-131]] is used in patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer for ablation of residual thyroid tissue after surgery and for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Patients with medullary, anaplastic, and most Hurthle cell cancers do not benefit from this therapy.<ref name=hu/> External irradiation may be used when the cancer is unresectable, when it recurs after resection, or to relieve pain from [[bone metastasis]].<ref name=hu/>
