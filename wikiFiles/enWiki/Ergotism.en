'''Ergotism''' is the effect of long-term [[ergot]] [[poison]]ing, traditionally due to the [[ingestion]] of the [[alkaloids]] produced by the ''[[Claviceps purpurea]]'' [[fungus]] which infects [[rye]] and other [[cereal]]s, and more recently by the action of a number of [[ergoline]]-based drugs. It is also known as '''ergotoxicosis''', '''ergot poisoning''' and '''Saint Anthony's Fire'''. Ergot poisoning is a proposed [[Medical and psychological explanations of bewitchment|explanation of bewitchment]].

==Causes==
[[File:Claviceps purpurea.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Claviceps purpurea]]'' fungal [[sclerotia]] growing on barley]]
The [[toxic]] ergoline [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] are found in ergot-based [[medication|drugs]] (such as [[methylergometrine]], [[ergotamine]] or, previously, [[ergotoxine]]).  The deleterious [[adverse effect|side-effects]] occur either under high [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] or when [[moderate]] doses interact with [[potentiators]] such as [[azithromycin]].

Historically, eating [[grain]] products contaminated with the [[fungus]] ''[[Claviceps purpurea]]'' also caused ergotism.

Finally, the alkaloids can also [[pass]] through [[lactation]] from [[mother]] to [[child]], causing ergotism in [[infant]]s.

==Symptoms==
The [[symptoms]] can be roughly divided into [[convulsive]] [[symptom]]s and [[gangrenous]] symptoms.

===Convulsive symptoms===
[[File:Convulsivus005.tif|thumb|left|Convulsive symptoms of ergotism]]
Convulsive symptoms include painful seizures and [[spasm]]s, [[diarrhea]], [[paresthesia]]s, itching, mental effects including [[mania]] or [[psychosis]], headaches, [[nausea]] and vomiting. Usually the gastrointestinal effects precede [[central nervous system]] effects.

===Gangrenous symptoms===
The dry [[gangrene]] is a result of [[vasoconstriction]] induced by the ergotamine-ergocristine alkaloids of the fungus. It affects the more poorly vascularized [[distal]] structures, such as the fingers and toes. Symptoms include [[desquamation]] or peeling, weak [[peripheral]] [[pulses]], loss of peripheral sensation, [[edema]] and ultimately the death and loss of affected [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].   Vasoconstriction is treated with [[vasodilators]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Piquemal | first1 = R | last2 = et al |title=Successful treatment of ergotism with Iloprost—a case report|journal=Angiology|volume=49 | number = 6|pages=493–97|year=1998 |month= June}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 018.jpg|thumb|right|Painting by [[Matthias Grünewald]] of a patient suffering from advanced ergotism from approximately 1512–[[1516|16]] AD]]
[[Epidemic]]s of the disease were identified throughout history, though the references in classical writers are inconclusive. Rye, the main [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for transmitting ergotism, was not grown much around the [[Mediterranean]]. When Fuchs 1834 separated references to ergotism from [[erysipelas]] and other afflictions, he found the earliest reference to ergotism in the ''Annales Xantenses'' for the year 857: "a Great plague of swollen blisters consumed the people by a loathsome rot, so that their limbs were loosened and fell off before death."

In the Middle Ages, the gangrenous poisoning was known as ''ignis sacer'' ("holy fire") or "Saint Anthony's fire", named after monks of the [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony|Order of St. Anthony]] who were particularly successful at treating this ailment. The 12th century chronicler [[Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois]] recorded the mysterious outbreaks in the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] region of France, where the gangrenous form of ergotism was associated with the local [[Saint Martial]] as much as Saint Anthony.

According to Snorri Sturluson, in his ''[[Heimskringla]]'', King Magnus, son of [[Harald Hardrada|King Harald Sigurtharson]], who was the half brother of Saint King [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Haraldsson]], died from ergotism shortly after the [[Battle of Hastings]].

The blight, named from the cock's spur it forms on grasses, was identified and named by [[Denis Dodart]], who reported the relation between ergotized rye and bread poisoning in a letter to the [[French Royal Academy of Sciences]] in 1676 ([[John Ray]] mentioned ergot for the first time in English the next year), but "ergotism", in this modern sense, was first recorded in 1853.

Notable epidemics of ergotism occurred up into the 19th century. Fewer outbreaks have occurred since then due to rye being carefully monitored in developed countries.  A severe outbreak of ergot poisoning occurred, however, in the French village of [[Pont-Saint-Esprit]] in 1951, resulting in five deaths.<ref>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Ira S |title=Principles and Practice of Toxicology in Public Health|year= 2008|publisher= Jones & Bartlett|location= Sudbury, [[Massachussetts|MA]] |isbn = 0‐7637‐3823‐9 |page=64}}</ref> [[Paranormal]] researcher [[John Grant Fuller]] wrote about the incident in his book ''[[The Day of St Anthony's Fire]]''.<ref name="Fuller1969">{{cite book | last =Fuller | first = John |title= The Day of St Anthony's Fire |publisher= Hutchinson |location= London |year= 1969 |isbn= 0-09-095460-2}}</ref>

When milled, the ergot is reduced to a red powder, obvious in lighter grasses but easy to miss in dark rye-flour. In less wealthy countries, ergotism still occurs; an outbreak in [[Ethiopia]] occurred in mid-2001 from contaminated [[barley]]. Whenever there is a combination of moist weather, cool temperatures, delayed harvest in lowland crops and rye consumption, an outbreak is possible.

Poisonings due to consumption of seeds treated with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] compounds are sometimes misidentified as ergotism.<ref>{{Citation | author-link = Jonathan Ott | first = Jonathan | last = Ott | title = Pharmacotheon: Entheogenic Drugs, their Plant Sources and History | place = Kennewick, WA | publisher = Natural Products | year = 1993 | page = 145}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | author-link = Albert Hofmann | first = Albert | last = Hofmann | title = LSD: My Problem Child | place = New York, NY | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1980 | url = http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/my_problem_child/chapter1.html | chapter = 1: How LSD Originated | page = 6}}.</ref>  As Dr. Simon Cotton (member of the Chemistry Department of [[Uppingham School]], UK) notes, there have been numerous cases of mass-poisoning due to consumption of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-treated seeds.<ref>{{Citation | quote = More horrifying than this were epidemics of poisoning, caused by people eating treated seed grains.

Another outbreak happened in Guatemala in 1965. Most serious was the disaster in Iraq in 1971–2, when according to official figures 459 died. Grain had been treated with methyl mercury compounds as a fungicide and should have been planted. Instead it was sold for milling and made into bread.

==How to identify and remove ergot==
*Look for dark purple or black ergot bodies in the heads of the cereal or grass just before harvest.
*Ergot bodies are larger than normal grain kernels, but can be smaller if the grain is a type of wheat.
*A larger separation between the bodies and the grain kernels show the removal of ergot bodies during the grain cleaning.
*Deep-plow fields which have a severe ergot infestation to bury the ergot head. Ergot will not germinate if buried more than one inch deep.
*Mow wild and escaped grasses and pastures before they flower, to prevent ergot infections.
*Commercially-prepared animal feeds almost never contain ergot.  Home-grown grain should be screened prior to feeding to animals.
*Feed containing ergot should not be fed to breeding females.

==Salem witchcraft accusations==
The [[Convulsion|convulsive]] symptoms that can be a result of consuming ergot-tainted rye have also been said to be the cause of accusations of [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|bewitchment]] that spurred the [[Salem witch trials]]. This medical explanation for the theory of “bewitchment” is one first propounded by [[Linnda R. Caporael]] in 1976 in an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. In her article, Caporael argues that the convulsive symptoms, such as [[Formication|crawling sensations in the skin]], [[Paresthesia|tingling in the fingers]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], ''[[Tinnitus|tinnitus aurium]]'', [[headache]]s, disturbances in sensation, hallucination, painful [[Muscle contraction|muscular contractions]], [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], as well as psychological symptoms, such as [[mania]], [[melancholia]], [[psychosis]] and [[delirium]], were all symptoms reported in the Salem witchcraft records. Caporael also states there was an abundance of rye in the region as well as climate conditions that could support the tainting of rye.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Caporael |first=Linnda R |authorlink= Linnda R. Caporael |title= Ergotism: The Satan Loose in Salem | journal= Science | volume= 192 | year= 1976 | month = April | doi = 10.1126/science.769159 |page = 21 | pmid= 769159 | issue= 4234 | bibcode = 1976Sci...192...21C}}</ref> In 1982 historian [[Mary Matossian]] raised Caporael’s theory in an article in ''[[American Scientist]]'' in which she argued that symptoms of “bewitchment” resemble the ones exhibited in those afflicted with ergot poisoning.<ref>{{cite journal | last= Matossian |first= Mary |title= Ergot and the Salem Witchcraft Affair |journal= American Scientist | volume= 70 | issue= 4 | page = 355 |year= 1982 |month=July–August |pmid=6756230 |bibcode= 1982AmSci..70..355M}}</ref>

The hypothesis that ergotism could explain cases of bewitchment has been subject to debate and has been criticized by several scholars. Within a year of Caporael’s article, the historians Spanos and Gottlieb argued against the idea in the same journal. In Spanos and Gottlieb’s rebuttal to Caporael’s article, they concluded that there are several flaws in the explanation of [[ergot]] poisoning as a cause of conditions associated with cases of alleged bewitchment. For example, they argued that if the food supply was contaminated, the symptoms would have occurred on a house-by-house basis, not just in particular individuals. Historian Leon Harrier has challenged this theory by claiming that even if supplies were properly cooked, residents suffering from stomach ulcers had a risk of absorbing the toxin through the stomach lining, offering a direct route to the blood stream. Being similar to Lysergic acid diethylamide ([[LSD]]), the chemical composition of the average human's stomach would be too acidic for the ergot to survive, especially if the food was properly cooked, but if some residents were malnourished and suffering from bleeding stomach ulcers, there is valid reasoning to say that while most of the residents would not be affected by ingesting contaminated grains, a small percentage could have become infected, offering an explanation for why ergotism was never initially recognized.  Harrier has even argued that the numbers could have been exponentially larger, possibly even the entire town, but due to the trials on bewitchment and heresy, and the fear of being accused and subsequently executed, few could come forward while suffering from legitimate medical conditions. Spanos and Gottlieb also state that ergot poisoning has additional symptoms not associated with the events in Salem and that the proportion of children afflicted were less than in a typical ergotism epidemic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 =Spanos |first1 = Nicholas | first2 = John ‘Jack’ | last2 = Gottlieb | title = Ergotism and the Salem Village Witch Trials |journal=Science |volume=194 |year=1976 |month=December |doi=10.1126/science.795029 |page =1390 |pmid=795029 |issue=4272 |bibcode = 1976Sci...194.1390S}}</ref> The anthropologist H. Sidky noted that ergotism had existed for centuries before the Salem witch trials, and argued that its symptoms would have been recognizable during the time of the Salem witch trials.<ref>{{cite book |last= Sidky |first= H |title= Witchcraft, Lycanthropy, Drugs and Disease: An Anthropological Study of the European Witch Hunts | publisher= [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-8204-3354-3}}</ref>
