A '''growth chart''' is used by [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]] and other health care providers to follow a child's growth over time. Growth charts have been constructed by observing the growth of large numbers of normal children over time. The [[human height|height]], [[weight]], and [[head circumference]] of a child can be compared to the expected parameters of children of the same age and sex to determine whether the child is growing appropriately. Growth charts can also be used to predict the expected adult height and weight of a child because, in general, children maintain a fairly constant growth curve. When a child deviates from his or her previously established growth curve, investigation into the cause is generally warranted. For instance, a decrease in the growth velocity may indicate the onset of a chronic illness such as [[inflammatory bowel disease]].

Growth charts can also be compiled with a portion of the population deemed to have been raised in more or less ideal environments, such as nutrition that conforms to pediatric guidelines, and no [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal smoking]].  Charts from these sources end up with slightly taller but thinner averages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/Technical_report.pdf | title = WHO Child Growth Standards | publisher = World Health Organization}}</ref>

Growth charts are different for boys and girls, due in part to pubertal differences and disparity in final adult height. In addition, children with diseases such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[Turner syndrome]] follow distinct growth curves which deviate significantly from children without these diseases. As such, growth charts have been created to describe the expected growth patterns of several genetic diseases.

Since there are differences in normal growth rates between breastfed and formula-fed babies,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7651784 | year = 1995 | last1 = Dewey | first1 = KG | last2 = Peerson | first2 = JM | last3 = Brown | first3 = KH | last4 = Krebs | first4 = NF | last5 = Michaelsen | first5 = KF | last6 = Persson | first6 = LA | last7 = Salmenpera | first7 = L | last8 = Whitehead | first8 = RG | last9 = Yeung | first9 = DL | title = Growth of breast-fed infants deviates from current reference data: A pooled analysis of US, Canadian, and European data sets.
