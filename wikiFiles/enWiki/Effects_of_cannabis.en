===Cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors===
The most prevalent psychoactive substances in [[cannabis]] are [[cannabinoids]], most notably [[tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]]. Some varieties, having undergone careful selection and growing techniques, can yield as much as 29% THC.<ref name="Kalant">{{Cite book| title=Principles of Medical Pharmacology | edition=6th | author=H.K. Kalant & W.H.E. Roschlau | year=1998 | pages=373–375}}</ref> Another psychoactive cannabinoid present in ''Cannabis sativa'' is [[tetrahydrocannabivarin]] (THCV), but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Carlton E. |last2=Bouwsma |first2=Otis J. |last3=Billets |first3=Steve |last4=Elsohly |first4=Mahmoud A. |title=Constituents ofCannabis sativa L. XVIII – Electron voltage selected ion monitoring study of cannabinoids |journal=Biological Mass Spectrometry |volume=7 |pages=247–56 |year=1980 |doi=10.1002/bms.1200070605 |issue=6}}</ref>

In addition, there are also similar compounds contained in cannabis that do not exhibit any psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality: [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), an [[isomer]] of THC; [[cannabinol]] (CBN), an [[oxidation]] product of THC; [[cannabivarin]] (CBV), an [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of CBN with a different [[sidechain]], [[cannabidivarin]] (CBDV), an analog of CBD with a different side chain, and [[cannabinolic acid]]. How these other compounds interact with THC is not fully understood. Some clinical studies have proposed that CBD acts as a balancing force to regulate the strength of the psychoactive agent THC. CBD is also believed to regulate the body’s metabolism of THC by inactivating [[cytochrome P450]], an important class of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Experiments in which mice were treated with CBD followed by THC showed that CBD treatment was associated with a substantial increase in brain concentrations of THC and its major metabolites, most likely because it decreased the rate of clearance of THC from the body.<ref name="joy" /> Cannabis cofactor compounds have also been linked to lowering [[body temperature]], modulating immune functioning, and cell protection. The [[essential oil]] of cannabis contains many fragrant [[terpenoid]]s which may synergize with the cannabinoids to produce their unique effects. THC is converted rapidly to [[11-hydroxy-THC]], which is also pharmacologically active, so the drug effect outlasts measurable THC levels in blood.<ref name="Kalant" />

THC and cannabidiol are also [[neuroprotective]] [[antioxidant]]s. Research in rats has indicated that THC prevented [[hydroperoxide]]-induced [[oxidative damage]] as well as or better than other antioxidants in a chemical ([[Fenton reaction]]) system and [[neuron]]al cultures. Cannabidiol was significantly more protective than either [[vitamin E]] or [[vitamin C]].<ref name="antioxidant 1998">{{cite journal |last1=Hampson |first1=A. J. |first2=M. |last2=Grimaldi |first3=J. |last3=Axelrod |first4=D. |last4=Wink |title=Cannabidiol and (−)Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol are neuroprotective antioxidants |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=95 |issue=14 |pages=8268–73 |year=1998 |pmid=9653176 |pmc=20965 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.14.8268 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.8268H}}</ref>

The cannabinoid receptor is a typical member of the largest known family of receptors called a [[G protein-coupled receptor]]. A signature of this type of receptor is the distinct pattern of how the receptor molecule spans the [[cell membrane]] seven times. The location of cannabinoid receptors exists on the cell membrane, and both outside ([[extracellular]]ly) and inside ([[intracellular]]ly) the cell membrane. CB1 receptors, the bigger of the two, are extraordinarily abundant in the brain: 10 times more plentiful than μ-[[opioid receptor]]s, the receptors responsible for the effects of [[morphine]]. CB2 receptors are structurally different (the sequence similarity <!-- homology is a concept not a quantity; google--> between the two subtypes of receptors is 44%), found only on cells of the immune system, and seems to function similarly to its CB1 counterpart. CB2 receptors are most commonly prevalent on [[B-cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[monocytes]], but can also be found on [[polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells]], [[Cytotoxic T cell|T8 cells]], and [[T helper cell|T4 cells]]. In the [[tonsils]] the CB2 receptors appear to be restricted to [[B-cell|B-lymphocyte]]-enriched areas.

THC and endogenous anandamide additionally interact with [[glycine receptor]]s.

===Biochemical mechanisms in the brain===
In 1990 the discovery of [[cannabinoid receptor]]s located throughout the [[brain]] and body, along with [[endogenous]] cannabinoid [[neurotransmitters]] like [[anandamide]] (a [[lipid]] material derived [[ligand]] from [[arachidonic acid]]), suggested that the use of cannabis affects the brain in the same manner as a naturally occurring brain chemical.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Cannabinoids usually contain a 1,1'-di-methyl-pyrane ring, a variedly derivatized [[aromatic ring]] and a variedly [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[Cyclohexane|cyclohexyl]] ring and their immediate chemical precursors, constituting a family of about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds. Like most other neurological processes, the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of [[signal transduction]], the [[electrochemical]] system of sending signals through [[neurons]] for a biological response. It is now understood that cannabinoid receptors appear in similar forms in most [[vertebrates]] and [[invertebrates]] and have a long [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary history]] of 500 million years. The binding of cannabinoids to cannabinoid receptors decrease [[adenylyl cyclase]] activity, inhibit [[Ion channel|calcium N channels]], and disinhibit [[potassium channel|K<sup>+</sup><sub>A</sub> channels]]. There are two types of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The CB1 receptor is found primarily in the brain and mediates the [[psychological]] effects of THC. The CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the [[immune system]]. Cannabinoids act as [[immunomodulators]] at CB2 receptors, meaning they increase some immune responses and decrease others. For example, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids can be used as a very effective [[anti-inflammatory]].<ref name="joy" /> The affinity of cannabinoids to bind to either receptor is about the same, with only a slight increase observed with the plant-derived compound CBD binding to CB2 receptors more frequently. Cannabinoids likely have a role in the brain’s control of [[Human musculoskeletal system|movement]] and [[memory]], as well as natural pain modulation. It is clear that cannabinoids can affect pain transmission and, specifically, that cannabinoids interact with the brain's endogenous [[opioid]] system and may affect dopamine transmission.<ref name="abadinsky">{{Cite book| title=Drugs: An Introduction | edition=5th | author=H. Abadinsky | year=2004 | pages=62–77; 160–166| isbn=0-534-52750-7}}</ref> This is an important physiological pathway for the medical treatment of pain.

===Sustainability in the body===
{{main|Cannabis drug testing}}
Most [[cannabinoids]] are [[lipophilic]] (fat soluble) compounds that are easily stored in fat, thus yielding a long [[elimination half-life]] relative to other [[recreational drug use|recreational drug]]s. The THC molecule, and related compounds, are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to Redwood Laboratories; heavy users can produce positive tests for up to 3 months after ceasing cannabis use (see [[drug test]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Toxicity===
[[THC]], the principal [[psychoactive constituent]] of the cannabis plant, has an extremely low [[toxicity]] and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death. In lab animal tests, scientists have had much difficulty administering a dosage of THC that is high enough to be lethal. Accordingly, there is little reason to believe a human would self-administer such doses.
According to the [[Merck Index]],<ref name=merck1996>1996. ''The Merck Index'', 12th ed., Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey</ref> the {{LD50}} of THC (the dose which causes the death of 50% of individuals) is 1270&nbsp;mg/kg for male rats and 730&nbsp;mg/kg for female rats from oral consumption in sesame oil, and 42&nbsp;mg/kg for rats from inhalation.<ref>{{citation |title=Cannabis Chemistry |url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_chemistry.shtml |publisher=Erowid.org}}</ref>

The ratio of cannabis material required to produce a fatal overdose to the amount required to saturate cannabinoid receptors and cause intoxication is approximately 40,000:1.<ref name=druglib>http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/mjfaq1.htm {{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}</ref><ref name=askmen>http://www.askmen.com/sports/health/20_mens_health.html {{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}</ref> A typical marijuana "joint" contains less than 10&nbsp;mg of THC, and one would have to smoke thousands of those in a short period of time to approach toxic levels.

:"We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use. What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect."

=== Psychoactive effects ===
{{see also|Medical_cannabis#Difference between C. indica and C. sativa}}

The psychoactive effects of cannabis, known as a "[[Substance intoxication|high]]", are subjective and can vary based on the person and the method of use.

When [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] enters the blood stream and reaches the brain, it binds to [[cannabinoid receptor]]s. The [[Ligand (biochemistry)|endogenous ligand]] of these receptors is [[anandamide]], the effects of which THC emulates. This [[agonist|agonism]] of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters, especially [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]]; neurotransmitters which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion, such as [[euphoria]] and [[anxiety]].
Some effects may include a general [[altered state of consciousness|alteration of conscious perception]], [[euphoria]], feelings of well-being, relaxation or stress reduction, increased appreciation of humor, music (especially discerning its various components/instruments) or the arts, joviality, [[metacognition]] and [[introspection]], enhanced recollection ([[episodic memory]]), increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, increased [[libido]],<ref>http://cannabislink.ca/info/MotivationsforCannabisUsebyCanadianAdults-2008.pdf</ref> and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and [[paranoia]] or [[anxiety]] are also typical. [[Anxiety]] is the most commonly reported side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or [[panic attacks]] after smoking cannabis.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medical Marijuana and the Mind|journal=Harvard Mental Health Letter|year=2010|month=April|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mental_Health_Letter/2010/April/medical-marijuana-and-the-mind|accessdate=April 25, 2011|author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref>

Cannabis also produces many [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and highly tangible effects, such as greater enjoyment of food taste and aroma, an enhanced enjoyment of music and comedy, and marked distortions in the [[time#Perception of time|perception of time]] and space (where experiencing a "rush" of ideas from the bank of long-term memory can create the subjective impression of long elapsed time, while a clock reveals that only a short time has passed). At higher doses, effects can include altered [[body image]], auditory and/or visual illusions, pseudo-hallucinatory or (rarely, at very high doses) fully hallucinatory experiences, and [[ataxia]] from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes. In some cases, cannabis can lead to [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] states such as [[depersonalization]]<ref name="medscape1">{{citation |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/468728_3|title=Medication-Associated Depersonalization Symptoms}}</ref><ref name="pmid15889607">{{cite journal |last1=Shufman |first1=E |last2=Lerner |first2=A |last3=Witztum |first3=E |title=Depersonalization after withdrawal from cannabis usage |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=249–51, 303 |year=2005 |pmid=15889607 |url=http://www.ima.org.il/Ima/FormStorage/Type3/05-04-07.pdf}}</ref> and [[derealization]];<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=BA |title=Psychopharmacological effects of cannabis |journal=British journal of hospital medicine |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=114–6, 118–20, 122 |year=1990 |pmid=2178712}}</ref> such effects are most often considered desirable, but have the potential to induce [[panic attack]]s and paranoia in some unaccustomed users.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Duration===
Effects of cannabis generally range from 10 minutes to 8 hours, depending on the potency of the dose, other drugs consumed, [[route of administration]], [[Set and setting|set, setting]], and personal tolerance to the drug's various effects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====Smoked====
The total short-term duration of cannabis use when smoked is based on the potency and how much is smoked. Effects can typically last two to three hours.<ref name="sagov" />

A study of ten healthy, robust, male volunteers who resided in a residential research facility sought to examine both acute and residual subjective, physiologic, and performance effects of smoking marijuana cigarettes. On three separate days, subjects smoked one [[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]] marijuana cigarette containing either 0%, 1.8%, or 3.6% THC, documenting subjective, physiologic, and performance measures prior to smoking, five times following smoking on that day, and three times on the following morning. Subjects reported robust subjective effects following both active doses of marijuana, which returned to baseline levels within 3.5 hours. Heart rate increased and the [[pupillary light reflex]] decreased following active dose administration with return to baseline on that day. Additionally, marijuana smoking acutely produced decrements in [[smooth pursuit]] eye tracking. Although robust acute effects of marijuana were found on subjective and physiological measures, no effects were evident the day following administration, indicating that the residual effects of smoking a single marijuana cigarette are minimal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fant |first1=R |title=Acute and Residual Effects of Marijuana in Humans |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=60 |pages=777–84 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0091-3057(97)00386-9 |issue=4}}</ref>

A Dutch [[double blind]], randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study examining male volunteers aged 18–45 years with a self-reported history of regular cannabis use concluded that smoking of cannabis with very high THC levels (marijuana with 9–23% THC), as currently sold in coffee shops in the Netherlands, may lead to higher THC blood-serum concentrations{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}. This is reflected by an increase of the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not always adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Tj. T. Mensinga|url=http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/267002002.pdf|format=PDF|title=A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study on the pharmacokinetics and effects of cannabis|publisher=[[RIVM]]|accessdate=2007-09-21|author-separator=,|display-authors=1}}</ref> High THC concentrations in cannabis were associated with a dose-related increase of physical effects (such as increase of heart rate, and decrease of blood pressure) and psychomotor effects (such as reacting more slowly, decreased ability to focus and concentrate, making more mistakes during performance testing, having less motor control, and experiencing drowsiness){{citation needed|date=May 2012}}. It was also observed during the study that the effects from a single [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] lasted for more than eight hours{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}. Reaction times remained impaired five hours after smoking, when the THC serum concentrations were significantly reduced, but still present{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}. However, it is important to note that the subjects (without knowing the potency) were told to finish their (unshared) joints rather than titrate their doses, leading in many cases to significantly higher doses than they would normally take{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}. Also, when subjects smoke on several occasions per day, accumulation of THC in blood-serum may occur{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

====Oral====
When taken orally (in the form of capsules, food or drink), the psychoactive effects take longer to manifest and generally last longer, typically lasting for 4–10 hours after consumption.<ref name="erowid.org">http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2011}}</ref> Very high doses may last even longer. Also, oral ingestion use eliminates the need to inhale toxic combustion products created by smoking and therefore reduces the risk of respiratory harm associated with cannabis smoking.

===Neurological effects===
The areas of the brain where cannabinoid receptors are most prevalently located are consistent with the [[human behavior|behavioral]] effects produced by cannabinoids. Brain regions in which cannabinoid receptors are very abundant are the [[basal ganglia]], associated with movement control; the [[cerebellum]], associated with body movement coordination; the [[hippocampus]], associated with [[learning]], memory, and [[stress (medicine)|stress]] control; the [[cerebral cortex]], associated with higher cognitive functions; and the [[nucleus accumbens]], regarded as the reward center of the brain. Other regions where cannabinoid receptors are moderately concentrated are the [[hypothalamus]], which regulates homeostatic functions; the [[amygdala]], associated with emotional responses and [[fear]]s; the [[spinal cord]], associated with peripheral sensations like pain; the [[brain stem]], associated with [[sleep]], [[arousal]], and motor control; and the [[Solitary nucleus|nucleus of the solitary tract]], associated with visceral sensations like [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pertwee |first1=R |title=Pharmacology of cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors |journal=Pharmacology & Therapeutics |volume=74 |pages=129–80 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0163-7258(97)82001-3 |issue=2}}</ref>

Most notably, the two areas of motor control and memory are where the effects of cannabis are directly and irrefutably evident. Cannabinoids, depending on the dose, inhibit the transmission of neural signals through the basal ganglia and cerebellum. At lower doses, cannabinoids seem to stimulate locomotion while greater doses inhibit it, most commonly manifested by lack of steadiness (body sway and hand steadiness) in motor tasks that require a lot of attention. Other brain regions, like the cortex, the cerebellum, and the neural pathway from cortex to [[striatum]], are also involved in the control of movement and contain abundant cannabinoid receptors, indicating their possible involvement as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Experiments on animal and human tissue have demonstrated a disruption of [[short-term memory]] formation,<ref name="joy">{{cite book | title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing The Science Base | author= J.E.

Cannabinoids inhibit the release of several neurotransmitters in the hippocampus such as [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[glutamate]], resulting in a major decrease in neuronal activity in that region. This decrease in activity resembles a "temporary hippocampal lesion."<ref name="joy" />

In ''[[in-vitro]]'' experiments THC at extremely high concentrations, which could not be reached with commonly consumed doses, caused [[competitive inhibition]] of the [[AChE]] enzyme and inhibition of [[Amyloid beta|β-amyloid]] peptide aggregation, implicated in the development of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of A aggregation, and this study provides a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may impact the progression of this debilitating disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eubanks |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Rogers |first2=Claude J. |last3=Beuscher |first3=4th |last4=Koob |first4=George F. |last5=Olson |first5=Arthur J. |last6=Dickerson |first6=Tobin J. |last7=Janda |first7=Kim D. |title=A Molecular Link Between the Active Component of Marijuana and Alzheimer's Disease Pathology |journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=773–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17140265 |pmc=2562334 |doi=10.1021/mp060066m}}</ref>

In ''Cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary'', the United Kingdom's [[Department for Transport]] reviewed data on cannabis and driving, finding "Cannabis impairs driving behaviour. However, this impairment is mediated in that subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired. Where they can compensate, they do, for example ... effects of driving behaviour are present up to an hour after smoking but do not continue for extended periods".<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme3/cannabisanddrivingareviewoft4764?page=12 Cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary (No.12)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The report summarizes current knowledge about the effects of cannabis on driving and accident risk based on a review of available literature published since 1994 and the effects of cannabis on laboratory based tasks. The study identified young males, amongst whom cannabis consumption is frequent and increasing, and in whom alcohol consumption is also common, as a risk group for traffic accidents. The cause, according to the report, is driving inexperience and factors associated with youth relating to risk taking, delinquency and motivation. These demographic and psychosocial variables may relate to both drug use and accident risk, thereby presenting an artificial relationship between use of drugs and accident involvement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme3/cannabisanddrivingareviewoft4764 |title=Cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary (No.12) |publisher=The National Archives (UK) |date={{date|2010-02-08}} |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme3/cannabisanddrivingareviewoft4764 |archivedate=2010  |accessdate={{date|2011-02-01}} }}</ref>

===Cardiovascular effects===
Cannabis arteritis is a very rare peripheral vascular disease similar to [[Buerger's disease]].

A 2008 study by the [[National Institutes of Health]] Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed [[blood proteins]] associated with [[heart disease]] and [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/13/pot-stroke.html |title=Heavy pot smoking could raise risk of heart attack, stroke |publisher=CBC |accessdate=2009-04-17 | date=2008-05-13}}</ref> This may be a result of raised carboxyhemoglobin levels from carbon monoxide. A similar increase in heart disease and ischemic strokes is observed in tobacco smokers, which suggests that the harmful effects come from a variety of combustion products, not just marijuana.

A 2005 article in the ''[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry]]'' reported on a 36-year-old man who suffered a stroke on three separate occasions after smoking a large amount of marijuana, despite having no known risk factors for the disorder, suggesting that a rare side effect of marijuana use may be an increase in the incidence of strokes among young smokers.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news |url=http://www.drugs.com/forum/latest-drug-related-news/more-evidence-ties-marijuana-stroke-risk-25372.html |title=More Evidence Ties Marijuana to Stroke Risk |last=Norton |first=Amy |date=2005-02-22 |work=Reuters Health|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> A 2000 study by researchers at Boston's [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and [[Harvard School of Public Health]] also found that a middle-age person's risk of heart attack rises nearly fivefold in the first hour after smoking marijuana, about twice the risk as vigorous exercise or sexual intercourse.<ref name="NYT 2000">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/03/us/report-links-heart-attacks-to-marijuana.html |title=Report Links Heart Attacks To Marijuana |last=Noble |first=Holcomb B. |date=2000-03-03 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>

Within 28 days, memory problems vanished and the subjects “were no longer distinguishable from the comparison group”.<ref>[http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/2012/09/medical-marijuana-in-massachusetts/5/ Lost in the Weeds: Legalizing Medical Marijuana in Massachusetts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Researchers from the [[University of California, San Diego School of Medicine]] failed to show substantial, systemic neurological effects from long-term recreational use of cannabis. Their findings were published in the July 2003 issue of the ''Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society''.<ref>[http://health.ucsd.edu/news/2003/06_27_grant.html Minimal Long-Term Effects of Marijuana Use Found<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The research team, headed by Dr Igor Grant, found that cannabis use did affect perception, but did not cause permanent [[brain damage]]. Researchers looked at data from 15 previously published controlled studies involving 704 long-term cannabis users and 484 nonusers. The results showed long-term cannabis use was only marginally harmful on the memory and learning. Other functions such as reaction time, attention, language, reasoning ability, perceptual and motor skills were unaffected. The observed effects on memory and learning, they said, showed long-term cannabis use caused "selective memory defects", but that the impact was "of a very small magnitude".<ref>http://www.cmcr.ucsd.edu/images/pdfs/Reuters_062703.pdf</ref>

==Long-term effects==
{{Main|Long-term effects of cannabis}}
Though the long-term effects of cannabis have been studied, there remains much to be concluded; debated topics include the drug's addictiveness, its potential as a "gateway drug", its effects on intelligence and memory, and its contributions to mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. On some such topics, such as the drug's effects on the lungs, relatively little research has been conducted, leading to division as to the severity of its impact. However, a study funded by the US government on the long term lung-related effects of marijuana has concluded that moderate marijuana use does not impair pulmonary function.<ref>{{citation |last=Szalavitz |first=Maia |url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/10/study-smoking-marijuana-not-linked-with-lung-damage/#ixzz2Gn0s57KC |title=Study: smoking marijuana not linked with lung famage |publisher=TIME.com |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Association Between Marijuana Exposure and Pulmonary Function Over 20 Years|authors=Pletcher, Mark et al.|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=307|issue=2|pages=173–181|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/307/2/173.abstract|doi= 10.1001/jama.2011.1961}}</ref>

More research is no guarantee of greater consensus in the field of cannabis studies, however; both advocates and opponents of the drug are able to call upon multiple scientific studies supporting their respective positions. Cannabis has been correlated with the development of various mental disorders in multiple studies, for example a recent 10 year study on 1,923 individuals from the general population in [[Germany]], aged 14–24, concluded that cannabis use is a risk factor for the development of incident psychotic symptoms. Continued cannabis use might increase the risk for psychotic disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d738 |title=Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study |publisher=[[BMJ]] |doi=10.1136/bmj.d738 |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2011-08-23 |last1=Kuepper |first1=R. |last2=Van Os |first2=J. |last3=Lieb |first3=R. |last4=Wittchen |first4=H.-U. |last5=Hofler |first5=M. |last6=Henquet |first6=C. |journal=BMJ |volume=342 |pages=d738 |pmid=21363868 |pmc=3047001}}</ref>

Efforts to prove the "gateway drug" hypothesis that cannabis and alcohol makes users more inclined to become addicted to "harder" drugs like cocaine and heroin have produced mixed results, with different studies finding varying degrees of correlation between the use of cannabis and other drugs, and some finding none. Some{{Who|date=August 2012}}, however, believe the "gateway effect," currently being pinned on the use of marijuana, should not be attributed to the drug itself but rather the illegality of the drug in most countries. Supporters of this theory{{attribution needed|date=January 2013}} believe that the grouping of marijuana and harder drugs in law is, in fact, the cause of users of marijuana to move on to those harder drugs.

There have been debates as to whether cannabis can lead to heavy addiction. According to one of the  studies on the issue, the [[La Guardia Committee]] of 1944, smoking marijuana could help to get out of the addiction from substances like [[cocaine]] or [[morphine]]. 

Cannabis [[withdrawal]] is included in the proposed revision of [[DSM-5]].<ref name="APA DSM-5">{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=430# |title=Proposed Revision &#124; APA DSM-5 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref><ref name="Elkashef">{{Cite journal | last=Elkashef | first=A | coauthors=Vocci F, Huestis M et al. | title=Marijuana neurobiology and treatment | journal=Substance Abuse | volume=29 | issue=3 | pages=17–29 | month=December | year=2008 | pmid=19042204 | doi=10.1080/08897070802218166 | pmc=2597384}}</ref><ref name="Vandrey">{{Cite journal | last=Vandrey | first=R | coauthors=Haney M | title=Pharmacotherapy for cannabis dependence: how close are we? | journal=CNS Drugs | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=543–553 | month= | year=2009 | pmid=19552483 | doi= | pmc=2729499}}</ref> Several drugs have been investigated in an attempt to ameliorate the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal. Such drugs include [[bupropion]], [[divalproex]], [[nefazodone]], [[lofexidine]], and [[dronabinol]]. Of these, dronabinol has proven the most effective.<ref name="Vandrey"/>

==Effects in pregnancy==
A study of 600 mothers that reported smoking cannabis during pregnancy suggested that it was not associated with increased risk of [[perinatal mortality]].<ref name=Fergusson2003>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1471-0528.2002.01020.x}}</ref> However, frequent and regular use of cannabis throughout pregnancy may be associated with a small but statistically detectable decrease in [[birth weight]].<ref name=Fergusson2003/>

Melanie Dreher, dean of nursing at Rush Medical Center in Chicago, conducted a study of Jamaican women who used cannabis throughout their pregnancies, as well as their babies' first year. The study was published in the ''American Journal of Pediatrics'' in 1994.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.clinchem.org/content/56/9/1442.full |title=Identifying prenatal cannabis exposure and effects of concurrent tobacco exposure on neonatal growth |authors=Teresa R. Gray, et al. |journal=Clinical Chemestry |date=2010-07-13 |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=1442–1450 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2010.147876}}</ref> Dreher expected to see a decrease in birth weight, but saw none. Instead, the exposed babies socialized and made eye contact more quickly, had better organization and modulation of sleeping and waking, and were less prone to anxiety.
On difference between the Jamaican and other studies' results, "Medicine hunter" [[Chris Kilham]] noted, "In U.S. studies where we've seen a similar investigation, women have concurrently been abusing alcohol and other drugs as well".<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/03/20/researchers-study-neuroprotective-properties-in-cannabis/#ixzz1psvX6oO3 |title=Researchers study neuroprotective properties in cannabis |publisher=Fox News |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>

==Pathogens and microtoxins==
Most [[microorganism]]s found in cannabis only affect plants and not humans, but some microorganisms, especially those that proliferate when the herb is not correctly dried and stored, can be harmful to humans. Some users may store marijuana in an airtight bag or jar in a [[refrigerator]] to prevent fungal and bacterial growth.<ref name="mojo">

===Fungi===

The fungi ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'',<ref name="mj">{{cite journal |last1=Kagen |first1=S |last2=Kurup |first2=V |last3=Sohnle |first3=P |last4=Fink |first4=J |title=Marijuana smoking and fungal sensitization |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=389–93 |year=1983 |pmid=6833678 |doi=10.1016/0091-6749(83)90067-2}}</ref> ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'',<ref name="mj"/> ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'',<ref name="mj"/> ''[[Aspergillus parasiticus]]'', ''[[Aspergillus tamarii]]'', ''[[Aspergillus sulphureus]]'', ''[[Aspergillus repens]]'', ''[[Mucor hiemalis]]'' (not a human pathogen), ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'', ''[[Penicillium italicum]]'' and ''[[Rhizopus nigrans]]'' have been found in moldy cannabis.<ref name="mojo"/> ''[[Aspergillus]]'' mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or handling of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly [[aspergillosis]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Some of the microorganisms found create [[aflatoxin]]s, which are [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]]. Researchers suggest that moldy cannabis thus be discarded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Mold is also found in smoke from mold infected cannabis,<ref name="mojo"/><ref name="mj"/> and the lungs and nasal passages are a major means of contracting fungal infections. Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggested baking marijuana in home ovens at 150 °C [302 °F], for five minutes before smoking. Oven treatment killed [[conidia]] of ''A. fumigatus'', ''A. flavus'' and ''A. niger'', and did not degrade the active component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)."<ref name="mojo"/>

===Bacteria===
Cannabis contaminated with ''[[Salmonella muenchen]]'' was positively [[correlation|correlated]] with dozens of cases of [[salmonellosis]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=David N. |last2=Wachsmuth |first2=I.

==Constraints on open research==
[[File:Drug bottle containing cannbis.jpg|thumb|upright|Drug bottle containing cannabis]]
In many countries, [[experimental science]] regarding cannabis is restricted due to its [[Legal issues of cannabis|illegality]]. Thus, cannabis as a drug is often hard to fit into the structural confines of medical research because appropriate, research-grade samples are difficult to obtain for research purposes, unless granted under authority of national governments.

===United States===
This issue was highlighted in the [[United States]] by the clash between [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] (MAPS), an independent research group, and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA), a [[Federal government of the United States|federal agency]] charged with the application of science to the study of drug abuse. The NIDA largely operates under the general control of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP), a [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House office]] responsible for the direct coordination of all legal, legislative, scientific, social and political aspects of federal drug control policy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The cannabis that is available for research studies in the United States is grown at the [[University of Mississippi]] and solely controlled by the NIDA, which has veto power over the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to define accepted protocols. Since 1942, when cannabis was removed from the U.S. [[United States Pharmacopoeia|Pharmacopoeia]] and its medical use was prohibited, there have been no legal (under federal law) privately funded cannabis production projects. This has resulted in a limited amount of research being done and possibly in NIDA producing cannabis which has been alleged to be of very low potency and inferior quality.<ref>''Lyle E. Craker, Ph. D. v. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration'', Docket No. 05-16, May 8, 2006, 8–27 [http://www.maps.org/mmj/dea_maps_final_briefs_5.8.06.pdf PDF]</ref>

MAPS, in conjunction with Professor [[Lyle Craker]], PhD, the director of the Medicinal Plant Program at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], sought to provide independently grown cannabis of more appropriate research quality for FDA-approved research studies, and encountered opposition by NIDA, the ONDCP, and the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform/people-working-legalize-medical-marijuana |title=People Working to Legalize Medical Marijuana |accessdate=2010-03-05 |date=2005-11-29 |publisher=ACLU}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
In countries such as the United Kingdom a license for growing cannabis is required if it is to be used for botanical or scientific reasons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} It is referred to as a "controlled drug". In such countries a greater depth and variety of scientific research has been performed. Recently several habitual smokers were invited to partake in various tests by British medical companies in order for the UK government to ascertain the influence of cannabis on operating a motor vehicle, with the conclusion that marijuana strongly impairs the ability to drive a motor vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
