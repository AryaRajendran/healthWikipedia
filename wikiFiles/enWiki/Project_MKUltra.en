'''Project MKUltra''' was the code name of a [[U.S. government]] covert research operation experimenting in the [[behavioral engineering|behavioral engineering of humans]] (mind control) through the [[CIA|CIA's]] [[Office of Scientific Intelligence|Scientific Intelligence Division]]. The program began in the early 1950s, was officially sanctioned in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964, further curtailed in 1967 and "officially halted" in 1973.<ref>{{cite news |title=C.I.A Says It Found More Secret Papers on Behavior Control: Senate Panel Puts Off Hearing to Study Data Dozen Witnesses Said To Have Misled Inquiry C.I.A.

Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the [[Church Committee]] of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and a [[Gerald Ford]] commission to investigate [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|CIA activities within the United States]]. Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] ordered all MKUltra files destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order.<ref name='Cia'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=An Interview with Richard Helms | date= 2007-05-08 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol44no4/html/v44i4a07p_0021.htm | publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-16 | language = }}</ref>

In 1977, a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to project MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings later that same year.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> In July 2001 some surviving information regarding MKUltra was officially [[declassification|declassified]].

==Background==
[[File:Mkultra-lsd-doc.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Sidney Gottlieb]] approved of an MKUltra subproject on LSD in this June 9, 1953 letter.]]

===Precursor experiments===
A precursor of the MKUltra program began in 1945 when the [[Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency]] was established and given direct responsibility for [[Operation Paperclip]]. The program recruited former [[Nazism|Nazi]] scientists, some of whom studied [[torture]] and [[brainwashing]], and several who had been identified and prosecuted as [[War crime|war criminals]] during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Walker |first=Andrew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4443934.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Project Paperclip: Dark side of the Moon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedEx.html |title=Jewish Law - Articles ("The Ethics Of Using Medical Data From Nazi Experiments") |publisher=Jlaw.com |date=1946-09-25 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>

Several secret U.S. government projects grew out of Operation Paperclip.  These projects included [[Project CHATTER]] (established 1947), and [[Project BLUEBIRD]] (established 1950), which was renamed [[Project ARTICHOKE]] in 1951. Their purpose was to study [[mind control]], [[interrogation]], [[behavior modification]] and related topics.

===MKUltra===
The project's intentionally oblique [[CIA cryptonym]] is made up of the [[CIA cryptonym|digraph]] ''MK'', meaning that the project was sponsored by the agency's [[Technical Services Staff]], followed by the word [[Ultra]] (which had previously been used to designate the most secret classification of [[World War II]] intelligence). Other related cryptonyms include [[Project MKNAOMI]] and [[Project MKDELTA]]. 

Headed by [[Sidney Gottlieb]], the MKUltra project was started on the order of CIA director [[Allen Welsh Dulles]] on April 13, 1953.<ref>Church Committee; [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book1/html/ChurchB1_0199b.htm p. 390] "MKUltra was approved by the DCI <nowiki>[</nowiki>Director of Central Intelligence] on April 13, 1953"</ref> Its remit was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc, largely in response to alleged [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]], and [[North Korea]]n use of mind control techniques on U.S. [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eh.doe.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html|title=Chapter 3, part 4: Supreme Court Dissents Invoke the Nuremberg Code: CIA and DOD Human Subjects Research Scandals|work=Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments Final Report|accessdate=August 24, 2005}} "MKUltra, began in 1950 and was motivated largely in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean uses of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea."</ref> The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives. The CIA was also interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders with such techniques,<ref>Church Committee; [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book1/html/ChurchB1_0200a.htm p. 391] "A special procedure, designated MKDELTA, was established to govern the use of MKUltra materials abroad. Such materials were used on a number of occasions."</ref> and would later invent several schemes to drug [[Fidel Castro]]. Experiments were often conducted without the subjects' knowledge or consent.<ref>Church Committee; "The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]], concluded that '[p]rior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects.'"</ref> In some cases, academic researchers being funded through grants from CIA front organizations were unaware that their work was being used for these purposes.<ref>

In 1964, the project was renamed MKSEARCH. The project attempted to produce a perfect [[truth drug]] for use in interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the [[Cold War]], and generally to explore any other possibilities of mind control. Another MKUltra effort, Subproject 54, was the Navy's top secret "Perfect Concussion" program, which was supposed to use sub-aural frequency blasts to erase memory. However, the program was never carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/e1950/mkultra/Hearing05.htm |title=Retrieved 25 April 2008 |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>

Because most MKUltra records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 by order of then CIA director [[Richard Helms]], it has been difficult, if not impossible, for investigators to gain a complete understanding of the more than 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MKUltra and related CIA programs.<ref name = Supremecourt>{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap3_4.html|title=Chapter 3, part 4: Supreme Court Dissents Invoke the Nuremberg Code: CIA and DOD Human Subjects Research Scandals|work=Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments Final Report|accessdate=April 16, 2013}} (identical sentence) "Because most of the MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 ... MK-ULTRA and the related CIA programs."</ref> 

The project began during a period of what Rupert Cornwell described as "paranoia" at the CIA, when America had lost its nuclear monopoly, and fear of Communism was at its height.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news |title=OBITUARY: SIDNEY GOTTLIEB |author=Rupert Cornwell |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sidney-gottlieb-1080920.html |newspaper=The Independent (London) |date=March 16, 1999 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> [[James Jesus Angleton]], head of CIA counter-intelligence, believed that the organization had been penetrated by a mole at the highest levels.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

==Goals==
The Agency poured millions of dollars into studies examining methods of influencing and controlling the mind, and of enhancing their ability to extract information from resistant subjects during interrogation.<ref name="question-torture">{{cite book|last=McCoy|first=Alfred|title=A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation from the Cold War to the War on Terror|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|year=2006|pages=8, 22, 30 |isbn=0-8050-8041-4}}</ref><ref name="shock-doctrine">{{cite book| last=Klein| first=Naomi | title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism | publisher = Picador | location = New York | year = 2007 | pages=47–49| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=G_h0PSD2wiQC&pg=PA47| isbn = 0-312-42799-9| authorlink = Naomi Klein}}</ref>

Some historians have asserted that creating a "[[The Manchurian Candidate|Manchurian Candidate]]" subject through "mind control" techniques was a goal of MKUltra and related CIA projects.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Ranelagh  | first = John  | title = The Agency: The Rise and Decline of the CIA  | publisher = Sceptre  | year = 1988  | pages = 208–210  | month = March  | isbn = 0-340-41230-5}}</ref>  Alfred McCoy has claimed that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of "ridiculous" programs, so that the public would not look at the primary goal of the research, which was developing effective methods of torture and interrogation.  Such authors cite as one example that the CIA's [[KUBARK]] interrogation manual refers to "studies at McGill University", and that most of the techniques recommended in KUBARK are exactly those that researcher [[Donald Ewen Cameron]] used on his test subjects (sensory deprivation, drugs, isolation, etc.).<ref name="question-torture" />

==Experiments==
CIA documents suggest that "chemical, biological and radiological" means were investigated for the purpose of mind control as part of MKUltra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c010.htm |title=Declassified |publisher=Michael-robinett.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> A secret memorandum granted the MKUltra director up to six percent of the CIA research budget in fiscal year 1953, without oversight or accounting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c043.htm |title=Declassified |publisher=Michael-robinett.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> An estimated $10 million USD ($80 million adjusted for [[inflation]]) or more was spent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.namebase.org/news12.html |title=Mind Control and the Secret State |first=Daniel |last=Brandt |date=1996-01–03 |work=[[NameBase]] NewsLine |publisher= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64k7LBApK |archivedate=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>

===Drugs===

====LSD====
[[File:ARTICHOKULTRADRAFT111.jpg|right|thumb|1953 experiment record]]
Early CIA efforts focused on [[LSD]], which later came to dominate many of MKUltra's programs. [[Technical Services Staff]] officials understood that LSD distorted a person's sense of reality, and they felt compelled to learn whether it could alter someone's basic loyalties.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks4.htm The Search for the Manchurian Candidate - Chapter 4<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The CIA wanted to know if they could make Russian spies defect against their will and whether the Russians could do the same to their own operatives.<ref name=autogenerated5 />

Once Project MKUltra officially got underway in April, 1953, experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes, "people who could not fight back", as one agency officer put it.<ref name=autogenerated7>{{cite news |title=Sidney Gottlieb, 80, Dies; Took LSD to C.I.A. |author=Tim Weiner |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/10/us/sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-to-cia.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=10 Mar 1999 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> In one case LSD was administered to a mental patient in Kentucky for 174 days.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> LSD was also administered to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions. LSD and other drugs were usually administered without the subject's knowledge or informed consent, a violation of the [[Nuremberg Code]] that the U.S. agreed to follow after World War II. The aim of this was to find drugs which would irresistibly bring out deep confessions or wipe a subject's mind clean and program him or her as "a robot agent".<ref name="rappoport">Rappoport, J. (1995). CIA Experiments With Mind Control on Children. Perceptions Magazine, p.56.</ref>

In [[Operation Midnight Climax]], the CIA set up several [[brothel]]s in San Francisco, California to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with one-way mirrors, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Marks  | first = John  | title = The Search for the Manchurian Candidate  | publisher = Times Books  | year = 1979  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-8129-0773-6 | pages = 106–7}}</ref> In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. The subjects were told that their "trips" would be extended indefinitely if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people being interrogated this way were CIA employees, U. S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this.<ref name="rappoport" /> [[Heroin]] addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The office of Security used LSD in interrogations but Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who directed MKUltra, had other ideas: he thought it could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he believed it could be given to high officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in "normal" settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point was reached where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often occurred, for example an operative who had received the drug in his morning coffee, became psychotic and ran across Washington, seeing a monster in every car that passed him. Incidents like that reaffirmed that LSD is a dangerous weapon but that only made them more enthusiastic. The experiments continued even after Dr. [[Frank Olson]], an army scientist who had not taken LSD before, went into deep depression after a surprise trip and later fell from a thirteenth story window (it is unclear whether he committed suicide or was murdered before being thrown out of the window).<ref name="lee">Lee, M. A., Shlain, B. (1985). Acid Dreams, the Complete Social History of LSD: the CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond. Grove Press.</ref>

Some subjects' participation was consensual, and in these cases they appeared to be singled out for even more extreme experiments. In one case, seven volunteers in [[Kentucky]] were given LSD for 77 consecutive days.<ref>NPR Fresh Air. June 28, 2007 and Tim Weiner, ''The Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA''.</ref>

LSD was eventually dismissed by MKUltra's researchers as too unpredictable in its results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c011.htm |title=Declassified |publisher=Michael-robinett.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> They had given up on the notion that LSD was "the secret that was going to unlock the universe," but it still had a place in the cloak-and-dagger arsenal. However, by 1962 the CIA and the army had developed a series of [[superhallucinogen]]s such as the highly touted [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]], which was thought to hold greater promise as a mind control weapon. This resulted in the withdrawal of support by many academics and private researchers, and LSD research became less of a priority altogether.<ref name="lee" />

====Other drugs====
Another technique investigated was connecting a [[barbiturate]] [[intravenous|IV]] into one arm and an [[amphetamine]] IV into the other.<ref>Marks 1979: pp 40–42.</ref> The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released. The person would then begin babbling incoherently, and it was sometimes possible to ask questions and get useful answers.

Other experiments involved drugs such as [[temazepam]] (used under code name MKSEARCH), [[heroin]], [[morphine]], [[MDMA]], [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[scopolamine]], [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]], and [[ergine]] (in [[Subproject 22]]).<ref>Marks 1979: chapters 3 and 7.</ref>

===Hypnosis===
Declassified MKUltra documents indicate [[hypnosis]] was studied in the early 1950s. Experimental goals included: the creation of "hypnotically induced [[anxiety|anxieties]]," "hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter," studying hypnosis and [[polygraph]] examinations, "hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects," and studying "relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c078.htm |title=Declassified |publisher=Michael-robinett.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> Experiments were conducted with drug induced hypnosis and with anterograde and retrograde amnesia while under the influence of such drugs.

===Canadian experiments===
[[File:Donald Ewen Cameron canmedaj01237-0046-a.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Donald Ewen Cameron c.1967]]
The experiments were exported to Canada when the CIA recruited Scottish psychiatrist [[Donald Ewen Cameron]], creator of the "[[psychic driving]]" concept, which the CIA found particularly interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from [[Albany, New York]] to [[Montreal]] every week to work at the [[Allan Memorial Institute]] of [[McGill University]] and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKUltra experiments there. In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as [[electroconvulsive therapy]] at thirty to forty times the normal power. His "driving" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing [[tape loop]]s of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions.<ref>Marks 1979: pp 140–150.</ref>  His treatments resulted in victims' [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[amnesia]], forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ect.org/dr-camerons-casualties/ |title=Dr. Cameron’s Casualties |accessdate=2007-09-09 |last=Turbide |first=Diane |date=1997-04-21 }}</ref> His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist [[William Sargant]] at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Collins  | first = Anne   | title = In the Sleep Room: The Story of CIA Brainwashing Experiments in Canada  | publisher = Key Porter Books  | date = [1988] 1998  | location = Toronto | pages = 39, 42–3, 133  | isbn = 1-55013-932-0}}</ref>

It was during this era that Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] as well as president of the [[American Psychiatric Association|American]] and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron had also been a member of the [[Nuremberg medical tribunal]] in 1946–47.<ref>Marks 1979: p 141.</ref>

[[Naomi Klein]] argues in her book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' that Cameron's research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was actually not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing "a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources.' In other words, torture." Citing [[Alfred W. McCoy]], Klein further writes that "Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Dr. Cameron's experiments, building upon [[Donald O. Hebb]]'s earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method."<ref name = Shock>{{cite book | last = Klein | first = N | authorlink = Naomi Klein | title = The Shock Doctrine | isbn = 0-676-97801-0 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=C0KIy92V58wC&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false 39–41] | publisher = Metropolitan Books | year = 2007}}</ref>

==Revelation==
[[File:FrankChurch.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Frank Church headed the Church Committee, an investigation into the practices of the US intelligence agencies.]]
In 1973, with the government-wide panic caused by [[Watergate]], the CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] ordered all MKUltra files destroyed.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite news |title=MIND CONTROL: MY MOTHER, THE CIA AND LSD |author=Elizabeth Nickson |url= |newspaper=The Observer |date=October 16, 1994 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms' purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

In December 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' alleged that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. That report prompted investigations by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], in the form of the [[Church Committee]], and by a presidential commission known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] that looked into domestic activities of the CIA, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and intelligence-related agencies of the military.

In the summer of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to influence and control human behavior through the use of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as LSD and [[mescaline]] and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973.<ref name="parascope.com">[http://www.parascope.com/ds/documentslibrary/documents/mkultrahearing/mkultraHearing02.htm Prepared Statement of Admiral Stansfield Turner, Director of Central Intelligence]. ParaScope.</ref> However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.<ref name=autogenerated6 />

The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]], concluded that "[p]rior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects". The committee noted that the "experiments sponsored by these researchers ... call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments."

Following the recommendations of the Church Committee, President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited "experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the [[informed consent]], in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.

[[File:ProjectMKULTRA Senate Report.pdf|thumb|1977 United States Senate report on MKUltra]]
In 1977, during a hearing held by the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], to look further into MKUltra, Admiral [[Stansfield Turner]], then Director of Central Intelligence, revealed that the CIA had found a set of records, consisting of about 20,000 pages,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that had survived the 1973 destruction orders because they had been stored at a records center not usually used for such documents.<ref name="parascope.com"/>  These files dealt with the financing of MKUltra projects and contained few project details, however much more was learned from them than from the Inspector General's 1963 report.

On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] said:
<blockquote>The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an "extensive testing and experimentation" program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens "at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign." Several of these tests involved the administration of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to "unwitting subjects in social situations." At least one death, that of [[Frank Olson|Dr. Olson]], resulted from these activities. The Agency itself acknowledged that these tests made little scientific sense. The agents doing the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing01.htm | title = Opening Remarks by Senator Ted Kennedy | date = 1977-08-03 | work = U.S. Senate Select Committee On Intelligence, and Subcommittee On Health And Scientific Research of the Committee On Human Resources}}</ref></blockquote>

In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984 on a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] news show, ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]''. It was learned that not only had the CIA funded [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Dr. Cameron]]'s efforts, but perhaps even more shockingly, the Canadian government was fully aware of this, and had later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S. counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of court for $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. None of Dr. Cameron's personal records of his involvement with MKUltra survive, since his family destroyed them after his death from a heart attack while mountain climbing in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyonair.com/?s=mkultra |title=HistoryOnAir Podcast 98 - MKUltra |publisher=Historyonair.com |date=2005-06-16 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref>

==1984 U.S. General Accounting Office report==
The U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] issued a report on September 28, 1984, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.

<blockquote>Working with the CIA, the Department of Defense gave hallucinogenic drugs to thousands of "volunteer" soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s.

(Note 37) Many of these tests were conducted under the so-called MKUltra program, established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing techniques. Between 1953 and 1964, the program consisted of 149 projects involving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects</blockquote>

==Deaths==

Given the CIA's purposeful destruction of most records, its failure to follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, and the lack of follow-up data, the full impact of MKUltra experiments, including deaths, will never be known.<ref name="Supremecourt"/><ref name="arts.rpi.edu"/><ref name="many other unofficial sites"/><ref name=albarelli>{{cite book |author=H.

Several known deaths have been associated with Project MKUltra, most notably that of [[Frank Olson]]. Olson, a [[United States Army]] biochemist and [[biological weapon]]s researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and died under suspicious circumstances a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MK ULTRA, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.<ref name="olson" />

The Olson family disputes the official version of events.  They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, many of which he had direct personal knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |title=The Olson File |publisher=Frankolsonproject.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24}}</ref> A few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research. Among Olson's concerns were the development of assassination materials used by the CIA, the CIA's use of biological warfare materials in covert operations, experimentation with biological weapons in populated areas, collaboration with former Nazi scientists under [[Operation Paperclip]], LSD mind-control research, the use of biological weapons (including anthrax) during the Korean War{{fact|date=April 2013}}, and the use of psychoactive drugs during "terminal" interrogations under a program code-named [[Project ARTICHOKE]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Statements/FamilyStatement2002.html | last = Olson | first = E | title = Family Statement on the Murder of Frank Olson | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | date = 2002-08-22 }}</ref>  Later forensic evidence conflicted with the official version of events; when Olson's body was exhumed in 1994, cranial injuries indicated that Olson had been knocked unconscious before he exited the window.<ref name="olson">Marks 1979: chapter 5.</ref> The medical examiner termed Olson's death a "homicide".<ref>{{cite book  | last = Ronson  | first = Jon  | title = The Men Who Stare at Goats  | publisher = [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]  | year = 2004  | location = New York | isbn = 0-330-37548-2 }}</ref>  In 1975, Olson's family received a $750,000 settlement from the U.S. government and formal apologies from President [[Gerald Ford]] and CIA Director [[William Colby]], though their apologies were limited to informed consent issues concerning Olson's ingestion of LSD.<ref name=albarelli/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/olson_documents.pdf | title = Documents on Cheney Coverup of Olson Assassination | publisher = [[Voltaire Network]] | format = PDF }}</ref>  On 28 November 2012, the Olson family filed suit against the U.S. federal government for the wrongful death of Frank Olson.<ref>http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCIENTISTS_DEATH_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2012-11-28-16-47-42</ref>

In his 2009 book, ''A Terrible Mistake'', researcher H. P. Albarelli Jr. concurs with the Olson family and concludes that Frank Olson was murdered because a personal crisis of conscience made it likely he would divulge state secrets concerning several CIA programs, chief among them Project ARTICHOKE and an [[MKDELTA]] project code-named Project SPAN.  Albarelli presents considerable evidence in support of his theory that Project SPAN involved the contamination of food supplies and the aerosolized spraying of a potent LSD mixture in the village of [[Pont-Saint-Esprit]], France in August, 1951.  The [[Pont-Saint-Esprit incident]] resulted in mass psychosis, 32 commitments to mental institutions, and at least seven deaths. In his work as acting chief of the Special Operations Division, Olson was involved in the development of aerosolized delivery systems; he had been present at Pont-Saint-Esprit in August, 1951; and several months before resigning his position he had witnessed a terminal interrogation conducted in Germany under Project ARTICHOKE. Other researchers have reached conclusions similar to Albarelli's, including [[paranormal]] author [[John Grant Fuller]] in ''The Day of Saint Anthony's Fire''.<ref name=albarelli/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7415082/French-bread-spiked-with-LSD-in-CIA-experiment.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | title=French bread spiked with LSD in CIA experiment | first=Henry | last=Samuel | date=2010-03-11 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

On April 26, 1976, the [[Church Committee]] of the United States Senate issued a report, "Final Report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operation with Respect to Intelligence Activities",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/finalreportofsel01unit#page/390/mode/2up |title=Final report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, United States Senate : together with additional, supplemental, and separate views |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref> In Book I, Chapter XVII, p 389 this report states:

:LSD was one of the materials tested in the MKUltra program.  The final phase of LSD testing involved surreptitious administration to unwitting non-volunteer subjects in normal life settings by undercover officers of the Bureau of Narcotics acting for the CIA.

: A special procedure, designated MKDELTA, was established to govern the use of MKUltra materials abroad. Such materials were used on a number of occasions. Because MKUltra records were destroyed, it is impossible to reconstruct the operational use of MKUltra materials by the CIA overseas; it has been determined that the use of these materials abroad began in 1953, and possibly as early as 1950.<ref name="Estabrooks1971">Estabrooks, G.H.

==Legal issues involving informed consent==

The revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director [[William Colby]] met with Olson's family to publicly apologize.

Previously, the CIA and the Army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of Army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an Army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine—known as the [[Feres doctrine]], after a 1950 Supreme Court case, ''[[Feres v. United States]]''—that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for any harms that were inflicted "incident to service."

In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed this defense in a 5–4 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: ''[[United States v. Stanley]]''.<ref>''[[United States v. Stanley]]'', {{ussc|483|669|1987}}</ref> The majority argued that "a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters." In dissent, Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of [[United States Bill of Rights|constitutional rights]]:

<blockquote>The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects... . [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.</blockquote>

Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], writing a separate dissent, stated:
<blockquote>No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.</blockquote>

This is the only Supreme Court case to address the application of the Nuremberg Code to experimentation sponsored by the U.S. government. Although the suit was unsuccessful, dissenting opinions put the Army—and by association the entire government—on notice that use of individuals without their consent is unacceptable. The limited application of the [[Nuremberg Code]] in U.S. courts does not detract from the power of the principles it espouses, especially in light of stories of failure to follow these principles that appeared in the media and professional literature during the 1960s and 1970s and the policies eventually adopted in the mid-1970s.

In another law suit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshal, after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/commons/5c/Ritchie.pdf | format = PDF | title = Ritchie v.
