'''Chromosome 1''' is the designation for the largest [[human chromosome]]. Humans have two copies of chromosome 1, as they do with all of the [[autosome]]s, which are the non-[[sex chromosome]]s. Chromosome 1 spans about 249 million [[nucleotide]] [[base pair]]s, which are the basic units of information for [[DNA]].<ref name=vega>http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=1 Chromosome size and number of genes derived from this database, retrieved 2012-03-11.</ref> It represents about 8% of the total DNA in human cells.<ref name="pmid16710414">{{cite journal |author=Gregory SG, Barlow KF, McLay KE, ''et al.'' |title=The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1 |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |pages=315–21 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16710414 |doi=10.1038/nature04727}}</ref>

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of [[genetics|genetic research]]. Chromosome 1 is currently thought to have 4,316 genes, exceeding previous predictions based on its size.<ref name=vega /> It was the last completed chromosome, sequenced two decades after the beginning of the [[Human Genome Project]].

The number of single nucleotide polymorphisms ([[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]s) is about 740,000.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Diseases & disorders==
There are 890 known diseases related to this chromosome. Some of these diseases are deafness, Alzheimer disease, glaucoma and breast cancer. Rearrangements and mutations of chromosome 1 are prevalent in cancer and many other diseases. Patterns of sequence variation reveal signals of recent selection in specific genes that may contribute to human fitness, and also in regions where no function is evident.
The following diseases are some of those related to genes on chromosome 1 (which contains the most known [[genetic disease]]s of any human chromosome):
* [[1q21.1 deletion syndrome]]
* [[1q21.1 duplication syndrome]]
* [[Alzheimer disease]]
* [[Alzheimer disease, type 4]]
* [[Breast cancer]]
* [[Brooke Greenberg]] Disease (Syndrome X)
* [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency]]
* [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]], types 1 and 2
