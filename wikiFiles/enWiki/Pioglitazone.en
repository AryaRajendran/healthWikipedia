'''Pioglitazone''' is a prescription drug of the class [[thiazolidinedione]] (TZD) with [[Anti-diabetic drug|hypoglycemic]] (antihyperglycemic, antidiabetic) action to treat [[diabetes]].  It is used to improve glucose control in adults over the age of 18 with type 2 diabetes. Pioglitazone is marketed as trademarks '''Actos''' in the USA, Canada, the UK and Germany, '''Glustin''' in Europe''', Glizone''' and '''Pioz''' in India by [[Cadila Healthcare|Zydus Cadila]] and [[USV Limited]], respectively and '''Zactos''' in Mexico by [[Takeda Pharmaceuticals]]. Actos was the tenth-best selling drug in the U.S. in 2008, with sales exceeding $2.4 billion.<ref>[http://drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/tradename/index.php?query=ACTOS Details for Actos].</ref> Its cardiovascular safety profile compares favorably with [[rosiglitazone]] (Avandia), which was withdrawn after concerns about an increased risk of cardiac events. However, pioglitazone has subsequently been found to be associated with bladder tumors and has been withdrawn in some countries.

==Pharmacology==
Pioglitazone selectively stimulates the [[nuclear receptor]] peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ([[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPAR-γ]]) and to a lesser extent [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|PPAR-α]].<ref name="pmid10983737">{{cite journal | title = Pioglitazone | journal = Drugs | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 333–43; discussion 344–5 | year = 2000 | month = August | pmid = 10983737 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200060020-00009| url = | last1 = Gillies | first1 = PS | last2 = Dunn | first2 = CJ }}</ref><ref name="pmid11594239">{{cite journal | author = Smith U | title = Pioglitazone: mechanism of action | journal = Int J Clin Pract Suppl | volume = | issue = 121 | pages = 13–8 | year = 2001 | month = September | pmid = 11594239 | doi = | url =  }}</ref> It modulates the transcription of the [[insulin]]-sensitive genes involved in the control of glucose and [[lipid metabolism]] in the [[muscle]], [[adipose tissue]], and the [[liver]]. As a result, pioglitazone reduces [[insulin resistance]] in the liver and peripheral tissues; increases the expense of insulin-dependent glucose; decreases withdrawal of glucose from the liver; reduces quantity of glucose, insulin and [[glycated hemoglobin]] in the bloodstream. Although not clinically significant, pioglitazone decreases the level of [[triglycerides]] and increases that of high-density lipoproteins ([[high-density lipoprotein|HDL]]) without changing low-density lipoproteins ([[LDL]]) and total cholesterol in patients with disorders of lipid metabolism, although [[statin]]s are the drug of choice for this.

==Indications and usage==
Pioglitazone is used for the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]] (previously known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM) in monotherapy and in combination with a [[sulfonylurea]], [[metformin]], or [[insulin]]. Pioglitazone has also been used to treat [[non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] (fatty liver), but this use is presently considered experimental.<ref name="pmid17135584">{{Cite journal | last1 = Belfort | first1 = R | last2 = Harrison | first2 = SA | last3 = Brown | first3 = K | last4 = Darland | first4 = C | last5 = Finch | first5 = J | last6 = Hardies | first6 = J | last7 = Balas | first7 = B | last8 = Gastaldelli | first8 = A | last9 = Tio | first9 = F | title = A placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine|N.

==Contraindications==
Pioglitazone cannot be used in patients with a known [[hypersensitivity]] to pioglitazone, other [[thiazolidinedione]]s or any of components of its [[pharmaceutical]] forms. It is ineffective and possibly harmful in [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] and [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].<ref name="contraindications">{{cite web |url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=22567#_CONTRAINDICATIONS |title=ACTOS (pioglitazone hydrochloride) tablet |author=U.S. National Library of Medicine |year=2010 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref> Its safety in pregnancy, [[lactation]] (breastfeeding) and people under 18 is not established.

Given previous experiences with the related drug [[troglitazone]], acute diseases of the liver are regarded as a [[contraindication]] for pioglitazone.

Pioglitazone and all other drugs of its class (thiazolidinediones) are absolutely contraindicated in patients with [[heart failure]].<ref name="contraindications"/>

==Side effects==
A press release by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2007 noted that there is a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given [[rosiglitazone]] compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial. Following release of this statement, Takeda also admitted that pioglitazone has similar implications for female patients.<ref name='Takeda, 2007'>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/UCM153896.pdf | title = Observation of an Increased Incidence of Fractures in Female Patients Who Received Long-Term Treatment with ACTOSO (pioglitazone HOI) Tablets for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus | accessdate = 2012-04-04 | last = Takeda | date = 2007 March | format = PDF}}</ref>

The risk of [[hypoglycemia]] is low in the absence of other drugs that lower blood glucose.

Pioglitazone can cause [[fluid retention]] and peripheral [[edema]]. As a result, it may precipitate [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause [[anemia]]. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous [[adipose tissue]]. In studies, patients on pioglitazone had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems.

On July 30, 2007 an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of "myocardial ischemic events" when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. Pioglitazone is currently being reviewed. A [[meta-analysis]] released subsequently showed that pioglitazone reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased [[Heart failure|CHF]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pioglitazone and risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized trials |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=10 |pages=1180–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17848652 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.10.1180 |author1=Lincoff AM |author2=Wolski K |author3=Nicholls SJ |author4=Nissen SE |author-separator=,}}</ref>
The PERISCOPE study compared pioglitazone with [[glimepiride]] in diabetics; [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic plaque]] volume was measured and followed over time. Glimepiride therapy had highly significant progression of plaque volume over time of 0.73 percent. In comparison, pioglitazone had a -0.16 percent regression in plaque volume. This is the first study to show that diabetic therapy slowed progression of [[atherosclerosis]]. Therapy with pioglitazone raised [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]], and lowered [[triglyceride]] and [[hsCRP]]; these are all beneficial effects on risk factors for coronary artery disease; however, to date, no oral anti-diabetic drug has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Comparison of pioglitazone vs glimepiride on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes |journal=JAMA |year=2008|volume=299|issue=13|pages=1561–73|doi=10.1001/jama.299.13.1561|url= http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299.13.1561v1 |pmid= 18378631 |author1= Nissen SE |author2= Nicholls SJ |author3= Wolski K |author-separator= , |last4= Nesto |first4= R. |last5= Kupfer |first5= S. |last6= Perez |first6= A. |last7= Jure |first7= H. |last8= De Larochelliere |first8= R. |last9= Staniloae |first9= C.

On June 9, 2011 the [[French Agency for the Safety of Health Products]] decided to withdraw pioglitazone in regards to high risk of [[bladder cancer]].<ref>http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2011/06/09/97001-20110609FILWWW00505-info-le-figaro-lantidiabetique-actos-retire-du-marche.php.</ref> This suspension was based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted by the French National Health Insurance. According to the results of the epidemiological study, the French agency found that patients, who were taking Actos for a long time to aid in type 2 diabetes mellitus, significantly increased risk of bladder cancer compared with patients who were taking other diabetes medications.<ref>http://www.medical-reference.net/2011/12/france-and-germany-suspended-use-of.html | France and Germany Suspended Use of Actos for Bladder Cancer Risk|</ref> On June 10, 2011 Germany's [[Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices]] also advised doctors not to prescribe the medication until further investigation of the cancer risk had been conducted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/10/takeda-germany-idUSL3E7HA0X920110610 | work=Reuters | first=James | last=Topham | title=UPDATE 2-Germany joins France in suspending top Takeda drug | date=June 10, 2011}}</ref>

On June 15, 2011 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] announced that pioglitazone use for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and that the information about this risk will be added to the [[Black box warning|Warnings and Precautions]] section of the label for pioglitazone-containing medicines. The patient Medication Guide for these medicines will also be revised to include information on the risk of [[bladder cancer]].<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm259150.htm | FDA Drug Safety Communication: Update to ongoing safety review of Actos (pioglitazone) and increased risk of bladder cancer|.</ref>  Former Actos/pioglitazone users have been filing lawsuits, notably starting with a Virginia plaintiff in US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.<ref>http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/actos/actos-bladder-cancer-side-effects-34-17865.html#.UYKFjit35cI</ref>

==Drug interactions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Combination with [[sulfonylurea]]s or [[insulin]] reciprocally exponentiate risk of [[hypoglycemia]]. Therapy with pioglitazone increased risk for pregnancy in those taking oral contraception.

==Formulations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Pioglitazone as Actos is supplied in oral tablets containing 15, 30 or 45&nbsp;mg of pioglitazone base. It is also available in combination with metformin as ActoplusMet (tablets containing 15&nbsp;mg pioglitazone and either 500 or 850&nbsp;mg of metformin), Competact (tablets containing 15&nbsp;mg pioglitazone and 850&nbsp;mg of metformin) or in combination with [[glimepiride]] as Duetact (tablets containing 30&nbsp;mg pioglitazone and either 2 or 4&nbsp;mg of glimepiride).
