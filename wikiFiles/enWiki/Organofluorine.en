'''Organofluorine compounds''' are [[organic compound|organic]] [[chemical compounds]] that contain [[carbon]] and [[fluorine]] [[Chemical bond|bonded]] in the polarized and remarkably strong [[carbon–fluorine bond]]. Organofluorine compounds are diverse, they can be [[fluorocarbon]]s, perfluorinated, or biologically synthesized mono-fluorinated compounds, among other possibilities. These compounds have a wide range of function and can serve as [[refrigerants]], [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[agrichemical]]s, [[surfactant]]s, [[ozone depletors]], [[poison]]s, or [[Pollution|pollutants]].  

==Bond==
[[Image:Carbon-fluorine-bond-polarity-2D-black.png|left|thumb|133px|C–F partial charges]]
{{main|Carbon–fluorine bond}}
The carbon–fluorine bond is referred to as the strongest in [[organic chemistry]] because of stability added by its partial ionic character; it forms the strongest single bond to carbon. The ionic character is a result of the electronegativity of fluorine. It induces partial charges on the carbon and fluorine atoms, leading to electrostatic attraction, making the bond short and strong. 

==Compounds==
Organofluorine compounds that have the carbon–fluorine bond are diverse in their types. They can be [[fluorocarbon]]s, fluorocarbon derivatives, fluorinated [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[agrichemicals]], or mono-fluorinated biologically synthesized compounds, among others. Fluorocarbons are compounds that contain only [[carbon]] and [[fluorine]],<ref>{{GoldBookRef | title = fluorocarbons | file = F02459}}</ref> while other molecules that contain many carbon–fluorine bonds are commonly referred to as fluorocarbons.<ref name="Lemal2004">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/jo0302556 |title=Perspective on Fluorocarbon Chemistry |year=2004 |last1=Lemal |first1=David M. |journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry |volume=69 |pages=1–11 |pmid=14703372 |issue=1}}</ref> Pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals commonly contain only one fluorine or a [[trifluoromethyl]] group.<ref name="Lemal2004"/> However, some are more highly fluorinated, such as hexaflumuron, which has six fluorines, in large part to a [[Tetra (disambiguation)|tetra]]fluoro[[ethoxy]] [[functional group]].

===Fluorocarbons===
{{main|Fluorocarbon}}
Fluorocarbons are molecules that ''only'' contain carbon and fluorine. They can be gases, liquids, waxes, or solids, depending upon their molecular weight. The simplest fluorocarbon is the gas [[tetrafluoromethane]] (CF<sub>4</sub>). Liquids include [[perfluorooctane]] and [[perfluorodecalin]]. The [[fluoropolymer]] [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE/Teflon) is a solid. While fluorocarbons with single bonds are stable, unsaturated fluorocarbons are more reactive, especially those with triple bonds.

===Perfluorinated compounds===
{{main|Perfluorinated compounds}}
Perfluorinated compounds are fluorocarbon derivatives, as they are closely structurally related to fluorocarbons. However, they also possess new atoms such as [[nitrogen]], [[iodine]], or ionic groups, such as [[perfluorinated carboxylic acid]]s.

==Alkyl fluorides==
Alkyl monofluorides can be obtained from alcohols and [[Olah reagent]] or another fluorinating agents.

==Properties==
Because of the varying degree of fluorination of organofluorine compounds, their properties are nearly impossible to compare as a group. "Every time you see a biologically active molecule that has fluorine in it, it could be in there for a different reason," says [[University of Florida]] chemistry professor William R. Dolbier Jr.<ref name=Thayer>{{cite journal

}}</ref> By contrast, fluorocarbon based compounds are fluorinated for specific chemical, physical, and sometimes biological reasons, as they have properties that are very distinct from [[hydrocarbons]]. Organofluorines with only one carbon–fluorine bond can simply behave as a hydrocarbon. Therefore, the one salient point for all organofluorine compounds is that the carbon–fluorine bond can dramatically alter biological properties.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=4359–69 |doi=10.1021/jm800219f |title=The Many Roles for Fluorine in Medicinal Chemistry |year=2008 |last1=Hagmann |first1=William K. |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=51 |issue=15 |pmid=18570365}}</ref>  While both [[uracil]] and [[5-fluorouracil]] are colourless, high-melting crystalline solids, the organofluorine is a potent anti-cancer drug. Similarly, [[Fluoroacetic acid|fluoroacetate]] is a potent natural poison while dilute [[acetic acid|acetate]] in water is [[vinegar]].

==Biological role== 
Biologically synthesized organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants, but not animals.<ref name="Murphy2003"/> The most common example is fluoroacetate, which occurs as a [[plant defence against herbivores]] in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil and Africa.<ref name="Proudfoot">{{cite journal |pages=213–9 |doi=10.2165/00139709-200625040-00002 |title=Sodium Fluoroacetate Poisoning |year=2006 |last1=Proudfoot |first1=Alex T |last2=Bradberry |first2=Sally M |last3=Vale |first3=J Allister |journal=Toxicological Reviews |volume=25 |issue=4 |pmid=17288493}}</ref> Other biologically synthesized organofluorines include ω-fluoro [[fatty acid]]s, fluoroacetone, and [[fluorocitric acid|2-fluorocitrate]] which are all believed to be biosynthesized in biochemical pathways from the intermediate fluoroacetaldehyde.<ref name="Murphy2003" /> [[Adenosyl-fluoride synthase]] is an enzyme capable of biologically synthesizing the carbon–fluorine bond.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/416279a |title=Biochemistry: Biosynthesis of an organofluorine molecule |year=2002 |last1=O'Hagan |first1=David |last2=Schaffrath |first2=Christoph |last3=Cobb |first3=Steven L. |last4=Hamilton |first4=John T.

Accessed November 8, 2008.</ref> Introducing the carbon–fluorine bond to organic compounds is the major challenge for medicinal chemists using [[organofluorine chemistry]], as the carbon–fluorine bond increases the probability of having a successful drug by about a factor of ten.<ref name=Thayer/> An estimated 20% of pharmaceuticals, and 30&ndash;40% of agrichemicals are organofluorines, including several of the top drugs.<ref name=Thayer/> Examples include [[5-fluorouracil]], [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[paroxetine]] (Paxil), [[ciprofloxacin]] (Cipro), [[mefloquine]], and [[fluconazole]].

==Environmental and health issues==
Abiotic processes can also result in organofluorines considered as "problem molecules." Fluorocarbon based CFCs and [[tetrafluoromethane]] have been reported in [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]].<ref name="Murphy2003"/> However, environmental and health issues still face many organofluorines. Because of the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond, many synthetic fluorocarbons and fluorcarbon-based compounds are persistent in the environment. Others, such as CFCs, participate in [[ozone depletion]]. Fluoroalkanes, commonly referred to as perfluorocarbons, are potent [[greenhouse gases]]. The [[fluorosurfactant]]s [[PFOS]] and [[PFOA]], and other related chemicals, are persistent global contaminants. PFOS is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] and may be harming the health of wildlife; the potential health effects of PFOA to humans are under investigation by the C8 Science Panel.
