'''Jian Zhou''' (1957-1999) (in Chinese convention Dr. Zhou Jian) is the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] virologist and cancer researcher, who with Australia’s [[Ian Frazer]], invented the [[vaccine]] for stimulating human immunological resistance to the [[cervical cancer]] inducing [[human papilloma virus]] ([[Gardasil]]®, [[Cervarix]]®).<ref>Gardasil® is a trademark of [[Merck & Co.]] and Cervarix® is a trademark of [[Glaxo Smith Kline]].  Merck & Co. and Glaxo Smith Kline provided the major funding for Zhou’s and Frazer’s VLP research.</ref> Hundreds of millions of young women have now enjoyed the benefits of this life preserving vaccine against [[HPV]], which causes 70%<ref name="pmid16670757">

Unlike his co-researcher Ian Frazer, however, Jian Zhou did not live long enough to see any of the fruits of his labors, to contemplate their unquantifiable benefit to human posterity or to enjoy the public adulation, rightly, accorded this sedulous achievement. In 1999, Jian Zhou succumbed to the sequela of a [[hepatitis]], which he had contracted in childhood in his native South East [[China]], where the disease is, unfortunately, still, even, to this day endemic.<ref name="forgott">[www.theaustralian.com.au/news/tribute-to-vaccines-forgotten-man-story-e6frg600-1111116233989]</ref> He did not even live long enough to see the U.S. patent for Ian Frazer’s and his vaccine and its method of production, and for which patent and priority they had both so long fought, finally, issue as U.S. patent 7,476,389, titled “Papilloma Virus Vaccines”, on January 13, 2009, after an [[Interference]] battle of over a decades length.<ref>Zhou and Frazer had filed an [AU] Australian patent on July 19, 1991, a [[PTC]] filing on July 20, 1992 and a subsequent U.S. patent application on January 19, 1994. Competing [[Georgetown University]] researchers Richard Schlegel and A. Bennet, who claimed invention priority to the VLP, had filed their original U.S. patent application after the date of Zhou’s and Frazer’s Australian application and priority date of invention, but, before the date of the pairs U.S. application. These “inventors” Schlegel and Bennet filed a patent Interference proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, while, there, during, making the speciously compelling argument that Zhou and Frazer should not receive the earlier Australian priority date for their invention under the provisions of the PTC, because Zhou and Frazer had failed to “fully disclose” their invention in their PTC filing and that, therefore, Schlegel and Bennet had legal, if not actual, priority to the invention of VLPs (an argument which the [[United States Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit]] decisively detailed as completely meritless in 2006 in ''Ian Frazer and Dr. Jian Zhou v. Richard Schlegel and A. Bennet Jenson'' (CAFC 2006-1154), the Court’s opinion reversing the P.T.O. In its September 20, 2005 decision in Interference proceeding No. 104,776 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.), the P.T.O. had erroneously earlier ruled in favor of “inventors” Schlegel and Bennet and that Frazer and Zhou were not entitled to the 1991 Australian invention priority date, because their PTC application disclosure was “inadequate”.)</ref> Jian Zhou has been called “Vaccines Forgotten Man”.<ref name="forgott"/>

With Frazer, Zhou postulated a quite novel approach for vaccinating. This theretofore unheard of method for achieving immunization was to use then nascent [[recombinant DNA technology]] to replicate a virus’s innocuous, but, antigen laden and immunologically targeted, protein shell sans its pernicious core and, then, to introduce those, of themselves, harmless proteins (now known as [[VLPs]] or “virus like particles”) into the human body to stimulate an immunological response thereto. “We basically had the same idea, which was to create a synthetic replica of the human pappilloma virus known as a virus like particle.” – Ian Frazer.<ref name="forgott"/> Zhou and Frazer began jointly investigating this approach to producing vaccine against and vaccinating against the human papilloma virus at the University of Queensland in 1984.

While on August 20, 2007 delivering the [[United States Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit]] opinion CAFC 2006-1154 (Ian Frazer & Jian Zhou v. Richard Schlegel and A. Bennet), that, finally, decisively, and conclusively ruled in favor of co-inventors Zhou and Frazer as to the Interference and their priority to the invention of VLPs, Circuit Judge [[Pauline Newman]] described the VLP invention in more detail as protein structures having an “external icosahedral shape of virus capsid and (which) thereby mimic the papilloma virus but Lack the disease causing genetic material.” and quoting from Zhou’s and Frazier’s July 20, 1992 PTC application in further detail “The method includes a initial step of constructing one or more [[recombinant DNA]] molecules which each encode papilloma virus LI protein or a combination of papilloma virus L1 protein and papillloma virus L2 protein followed by a further step of transfecting a suitable host cell with one or more recombinant DNA molecules so that, virus like particles (VLPs) are produced within the cell after expression of the L1 or L1 and L2 proteins. The VLPs are also claimed per se as well as vaccines incorporating the VLPs.”<ref>See, also, U.S. patent 5,993,821, granted on Nov. 30, 1999, “(independent invention claim) 1. A protein consisting of L2 protein which does not bind DNA or which has an impaired ability to bind DNA … (independent invention claim) 15. A method of producing one or more virus like particles comprising a papilloma virus L1 protein and a papilloma virus L2 protein, wherein said papilloma virus L2 protein does not bind to DNA or has an impaired ability to bind to DNA compared to a wild-type papilloma virus L2 protein, said method comprising the steps of: (1) constructing a recombinant DNA molecule comprising a DNA sequence encoding said papilloma virus L2 protein wherein said sequence is operably linked to a promoter; (2) introducing said recombinant DNA molecule into a suitable host cell; (3) expressing said papilloma in said host cell in the presence of said papilloma virus L1 protein to form one or more virus-like-particles; and (4) recovering one or more (unbound) virus-like-particles from said host cell.”</ref>

Ian Frazer has, to his enduring merit, forthrightly, adamantly and consistently credited his deceased friend and colleague Jian Zhou with alone devising the in vitro method and technology which, finally, after some decade of discouraging and demoralizing failures, succeeded at using recombinant DNA technology to fabricate the VLP of the pair’s invention and which was, first, successfully executed by Jian Zhou’s wife and fellow researcher [[Xiao – Yi Sun]].<ref name="forgott"/> ”From my point of view, I think having full public acknowledgement of Jian’s contribution to the work … is long overdue.” – Ian Frazer speaking at Dr. Jian Zhou’s belated 1 P.M. May 3, 2008 memorial service in Brisbane, Australia.<ref>[http://news.theage.com.au/national/gardasil-developer-remembered-in-gld-20080503-2am4.html] "Gardasil Developer Remembered", ''The Age''</ref><ref>Also, Ruth Beran, “Ian Frazer’s patent problem”, ''Australian Life Scientist'', 21 June 2008, quoting Ian Frazer “Jian Zhou died in 1999 but he was an equal partner.”</ref>

Jian Zhou received his medical degree from South China’s [[Wenzhou Medical College]] near [[Shanghai]].<ref name="forgott"/> Jian Zhou was survived by his wife Xiao-Yi Sun and his and their only child, a son Andreas.

''“We owe him (Dr. Jian Zhou) a great deal because not only was he involved in developing the papilloma virus vaccine, but he also has mentored a whole generation of Chinese scientists in Australia, who are now going out there and doing equally interesting science.”'' – [[Ian Frazer]], M.B.B.S.
