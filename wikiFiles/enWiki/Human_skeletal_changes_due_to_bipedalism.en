The evolution of human '''[[bipedalism]]''' approximately four million years ago<ref name=Shiro>{{cite book |author=Kondō, Shirō |title=Primate morphophysiology, locomotor analyses, and human bipedalism |publisher=University of Tokyo Press |location=Tokyo |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=4-13-066093-4 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> has led to [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] alterations to the [[human skeleton]] including changes to the arrangement and size of the bones of the foot, [[hip]] size and shape, [[knee]] size, [[Human leg|leg]] length, and the shape and orientation of the [[vertebral column]]. The [[evolutionary factor]]s that produced these changes have been the subject of [[Bipedalism#Humans|several theories]].

==Foot==
{{main|Foot}}
The human [[foot]] evolved to act as a platform to support the entire [[weight]] of the body, rather than acting as a grasping structure, as it did in early [[hominid]]s. Humans therefore have smaller toes than their bipedal ancestors.  This includes a non-opposable [[hallux]], which is relocated in line with the other toes.<ref name=Aiello&Dean>{{cite book |author=Aiello,Leslie and Christopher Dean |title=An Introduction to Human Evolutionary Anatomy|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=1990 |isbn=0-12-045591-9}}</ref>  Moreover, humans have a foot [[Arches of the foot|arch]] rather than flat feet.<ref name = Aiello&Dean/>  When non-human hominids walk upright, weight is transmitted from the [[heel]], along the outside of the foot, and then through the middle toes while a human foot transmits weight from the heel, along the outside of the foot, across the [[Ball (anatomy)|ball of the foot]] and finally through the big toe. This transference of weight contributes to [[Conservation of energy|energy conservation]] during [[Terrestrial locomotion|locomotion]].<ref name=Shiro/><ref name=Latimer&Lovejoy1989>{{cite journal |author=Latimer, B., & Lovejoy, C.O. |title=The Calcaneus of Australopithecus afarensis and its implications for the Evolution of Bipedality |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=369–386 |year=1989 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330780306 |pmid=2929741}}</ref>

==Hip==
{{main|Hip (anatomy)}}
Modern human [[hip (anatomy)|hip]] [[joint]]s are larger than in [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] [[Common descent|ancestral species]] to better support the greater amount of body weight passing through them,<ref name = Aiello&Dean/> as well as having a shorter, broader shape.  This alteration in shape brought the [[vertebral column]] closer to the hip joint, providing a stable base for support of the trunk while walking upright.<ref name=Wang2004>{{cite journal | author = Wang, W. | coauthors = Crompton, R.H.; Carey, T.S.; Günther, M.M.; Li, Y.; Savage, R.; Sellers, W.I. | year = 2004 | title = Comparison of inverse-dynamics musculo-skeletal models of AL 288-1 Australopithecus afarensis and KNM-WT 15000 Homo ergaster to modern humans, with implications for the evolution of bipedalism | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 453–478 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047248404001265  | accessdate = 2008-04-02 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.08.007 | pmid = 15566947}}</ref> Also, because bipedal walking requires humans to balance on a relatively unstable [[ball and socket joint]], the placement of the vertebral column closer to the hip joint allows humans to invest less muscular effort in [[balance (ability)|balancing]].<ref name = Aiello&Dean/> Change in the shape of the hip may have led to the decrease in the degree of hip [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]], an energy efficient adaptation.<ref name=Shiro/><ref name=Lovejoy1988>{{cite journal |author=Lovejoy, C. Owen |title=Evolution of Human walking |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=259 |issue=5 |pages=82–89 |year=1988 |url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/krigbaum/proseminar/Lovejoy_1988_SA.pdf}}</ref>

==Knee==
{{main|Knee}}
Human [[knee]] joints are enlarged for the same reason as the hip – to better support an increased amount of body weight.<ref name = Aiello&Dean/>  The degree of knee extension (the angle between the thigh and shank in a walking cycle) has decreased. The changing pattern of the knee joint angle of humans shows a small extension peak, called the “double knee action,” in the midstance phase.  Double knee action decreases energy lost by vertical movement of the center of gravity.<ref name=Shiro/> Humans walk with their knees kept straight and the [[thigh]]s bent inward so that the knees are almost directly under the body, rather than out to the side, as is the case in ancestral hominids. This type of gait also aids balance.<ref name = Aiello&Dean/>

==Limbs==
{{main|Human leg|upper limb}}
An increase in leg length since the evolution of bipedalism changed how leg muscles functioned in upright gait. In humans the "push" for walking comes from the leg muscles acting at the ankle.  A longer leg allows the use of the natural swing of the limb so that, when walking, humans do not need to use muscle to swing the other leg forward for the next step.<ref name = Aiello&Dean/> As a consequence, since the human forelimbs are not needed for locomotion, they are instead optimized for carrying, holding, and manipulating objects with great precision.<ref name="Saladin">{{cite book

Having long hindlimbs and short forelimbs allows humans to walk upright, while orangutans and gibbons had the adaptation of longer arms to swing on branches.<ref>Thorpe, S. "Origin of Human Bipedalism As an Adaptation for Locomotion on Flexible Branches." AAAS Science. AAAS Science, 18 May 2007. Web. 08 Dec. 2010. <http://www.sciencemag.org/content/316/5829/1328.full>.</ref>  Apes can stand on their hindlimbs, but they cannot do so for long periods of time without getting tired.  This is because they haven’t adapted their femur for bipedalism. Apes have vertical femurs, while humans have femurs that are slightly angled medially from the hip to the knee.   This adaptation allows our knees to be closer together and under the body’s center of gravity.  This permits humans to lock their knees and stand up straight for long periods of time without much effort from the muscles.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. "Chapter 8."

== Skull ==
{{main|Human skull}}
The [[human skull]] is balanced on the vertebral column: The [[foramen magnum]] is located inferiorly under the skull, which puts much of the weight of the head behind the spine.  Furthermore, the flat human face helps to maintain balance on the [[occipital condyle]]s. Because of this, the erect position of the head is possible without the prominent [[supraorbital ridge]]s and the strong muscular attachments found in, for example, apes.  As a result, in humans the muscles of the forehead (the [[Occipitofrontalis muscle|occipitofrontalis]]) are only used for facial expressions.<ref name="Saladin" />

==Vertebral column==
{{main|Vertebral column}}
The vertebral column of humans takes a forward bend in the lumbar (lower) region and a backward bend in the thoracic (upper) region.  Without the lumbar curve, the vertebral column would always lean forward, a position that requires much more muscular effort for bipedal animals.  With a forward bend, humans use less muscular effort to stand and walk upright.<ref name=Wang2004/>  Together the lumbar and thoracic curves bring the body's center of gravity directly over the feet.<ref name = Aiello&Dean/>  Also, the degree of body erection (the angle of body incline to a vertical line in a walking cycle) is significantly smaller<ref name=Shiro/> to conserve energy.

== Significance ==

Even with much anatomical modification, some features of the human skeleton remain poorly adapted to bipedalism, leading to negative implications prevalent in humans today.  The lower back and knee joints are plagued by osteological malfunction, lower back pain being a leading cause of lost working days,<ref name = Koella/> because the joints support more weight. Arthritis has been a problem since hominids became bipedal: scientists have discovered its traces in the vertebrae of prehistoric hunter-gatherers.<ref name=Koella>{{cite book |author=Jacob C. Koella; Stearns, Stephen K. |title=Evolution in Health and Disease |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-19-920746-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  Physical constraints have made it difficult to modify the joints for further stability while maintaining efficiency of locomotion.<ref name = Aiello&Dean/>
